It is located about five kilometres south of Edfu near Naga el- Ghoneimeya. It was first identified as a pyramid in 1979, when the German archaeologists G√ºnter Dreyer and were leading a survey of Edfu after a tip off from the inspector. Further investigation and surveys of the surrounding area have been undertaken since 2010 by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.  Description  According to the findings of Dreyer and Kaiser, the pyramid was 35‚Äì6 cubits long on each side (about 18.30-18.80 metres). It is now about 4.9 metres high. It consisted of a core structure measuring 8.3 metres on each side, surrounded by two courses of stone about four cubits thick. Dreyer and Kaiser suggested that the pyramid had had three steps. The angle of the slope cannot be accurately determined, but it was probably between 10¬∞ and 14¬∞. The pyramid is almost oriented to the north, but is slightly off true north (like the other pyramids named above) as it is primarily oriented in order to be parallel to the Nile. The pyramid is built from local grey-blue and red sandstone. The individual blocks are only roughly hewn ‚Äì on average they are 30 cm thick, but the largest examples measure 60‚Äì80 cm. A mixture of clay and sand was used as mortar.  Construction and function  The builder and purpose of the pyramid and unknown. Dreyer and Kaiser thought that it and the other pyramids named above were part of a single building project of Pharaoh Huni, the last ruler of the Third Dynasty. Andrzej ƒÜwiek mostly agrees, but suggests that Huni's successor, Sneferu (c.2670‚Äì2630 BC) the founder of the Fourth Dynasty, was the builder. Speculation about the function of the pyramids ranges from a representation of the king, a depiction of the benben, or a symbol of the political and religious unity of the land to a cenotaph for a royal wife.

Located at NJ‚Äôs Regional Operations and Intelligence Center (ROIC), and acting in a cyber fusion center capacity the NJCCIC is composed of staff from NJOHSP, the NJ Office of Information Technology, and the NJ State Police. The NJCCIC's nomenclature is derived from its federal counterpart, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, which encompasses the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). History On May 20, 2015, Governor Chris Christie signed an Executive order to establish the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell, proclaiming that \\"protecting the citizens and public and private institutions within the State of New Jersey from the threat of cybersecurity attacks is priority of [his] Administration.\\" Governor Christie's directive followed a Presidential Executive Order from February 2015 signed at Stanford University \\"encourag[ing] the development and formation of Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs)...organized on the basis of sector, sub-sector, region, or any other affinity...\\" The formation of the NJCCIC also coincided with the aftermath of crippling and costly cyber-attacks against Rutgers University, New Jersey's largest public academic institution. The NJCCIC played a role in protecting Pope Francis during his 2015 visit to New York City and Philadelphia.  Leadership  Jared Maples was named Director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (NJOHSP) by Governor Philip Murphy on April 17, 2018. In his role, he serves as the federally designated Homeland Security Advisor (HSA) to the Governor and is the Cabinet- level executive responsible for coordinating and leading New Jersey‚Äôs Counterterrorism, Cybersecurity, and Emergency Preparedness efforts. Michael Geraghty is New Jersey's Chief Information Security Officer and the first Director of the NJCCIC. Director Geraghty manages the day-to-day functions of the NJCCIC. Mission The NJCCIC acts in a clearinghouse capacity providing New Jersey with a resource to coordinate cyber security information sharing and incident reporting, perform cybersecurity threat analysis, and promote shared and real-time situational awareness between and among public and private sectors. Beyond just sharing cyber threat intelligence, the NJCCIC also provides strategies and tactics that businesses, as well as state, county and local governments, academic institutions, and other organizations can implement to mitigate against current and emerging threats. Additionally, the NJCCIC manages a membership based information sharing platform where members receive cyber alerts, advisories, training announcements and bulletins directly via email, maintains an active social media presence and manages the cyber.nj.gov website to provide free cybersecurity resources. The \\"Garden State Model\\" for cybersecurity The NJCCIC received praise from Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society for \\"innovating\\" on cybersecurity information sharing at a pace and scale that few states have achieved. Incident response is currently limited to Executive Branch agencies in New Jersey, but according to a November 2015 study, \\"State of the States on Cybersecurity\\" by the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy, there are \\"plans to create a NJ CERT\\", or New Jersey Computer Emergency Readiness Team, to be deployed statewide. Partnerships On July 8, 2015, the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell partnered with the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) to \\"share and analyze cyber threat information on behalf of New Jersey's banking institutions\\". In January 2016, the NJCCIC and the National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center announced a partnership to improve cybersecurity information sharing with New Jersey‚Äôs healthcare providers.

It was established in 1983 by graduates of Glasgow School of Art. It primarily shows the work of young early career artists and is run by a changing voluntary committee of six people. Among the artists who have served on its committee are Douglas Gordon, Claire Barclay, Roderick Buchanan, Christine Borland, Jacqueline Donachie, Martin Boyce, Simon Starling and Lucy Skaer.  History  Transmission is Glasgow's oldest artist-run gallery, established in 1983 by art school graduates who felt dissatisfied with the opportunities available to them on graduating. From its inception the gallery has been run by a changing committee and offered membership. When it was founded, it was supported by the Scottish Arts Council and Glasgow City Council. Its first address was 13‚Äì15 Chisholm Street, Trongate, Glasgow. On the opening night Alexander Moffat gave a speech, calling the gallery 'far more important than the Burrell Collection.' As well as exhibitions, the gallery's programme has always included talks, readings and events. Curator Craig Richardson notes that in the early days of Transmission, the gallery's membership 'was encouraged to take advantage of the gallery typewriter and telephone which were domestic rarities for mainly unemployed artists in the late 1980s and early 1990s.' In 1989 the gallery moved to 28 King Street, Trongate, Glasgow. The new space was a 'white cube' gallery. Nicola White wrote in 1995: > 'Previously the gallery had deliberately positioned itself outside the > cultural mainstream. In the early '90s Transmission became, not mainstream, > but certainly more allied to the international art scene. Entering the > clean-lined space, once could have been in any city in Europe. Alliances and > exchanges were made with like-minded artists and galleries in such places as > Belfast, London, Chicago and Cologne. The gallery became increasingly > recognised outside of Scotland, and increasingly reviewed in the press.' Several artists associated with the gallery (either through serving on the committee, being a member, or showing at the gallery) have gone on to win or be nominated for the Turner Prize. The resource room at Transmission Gallery holds a physical library, a collection of slides and visual material left by artists, as well as the Transmission Archive. The Archive includes the gallery's exhibition and events poster archive. The Transmission website also displays encounters with the archive by invited researchers and artists, these are available to view on the website for two years post publishing.  Committee  The first committee of Transmission, from 1983 to 1986, was Alastair Magee, Lesley Raeside, John Rogan, Michelle Baucke and Alistair Strachan. The second committee, from 1986 to 1988, was Gordon Muir, Malcolm Dickson, Carol Rhodes, Peter Thompson, Simon Brown and Douglas Aubrey. From 1988 to the present the following people have been on a rolling committee: Douglas Gordon, Alastair Magee, Lesley Raeside, John Rogan, Malcolm Dickson, Carol Rhodes, Douglas Aubrey, Richard Walker, Jayne Taylor, Tommy Lydon, Billy Clark, Karen Strang, Gillian Steel, Scott Paterson, Anne Elliot, David Allen, Christine Borland, Mike Ellen, Pete Gilmour, Euan Sutherland, Anne Vance, Craig Richardson, Claire Barclay, Elsie Mitchell, Roderick Buchanan, Katrina Brown, Jacqueline Donachie, Martin Boyce, Simon Starling, Kirsty Ogg, Eva Rothschild, Will Bradley, Toby Webster, Tanya Leighton, Judith Welk, Caroline Kirsop, Toby Paterson, Sarah Tripp, Robert Johnston, Ewan Imrie, Julian Kildear, Lucy Skaer, Sophie Macpherson, Rose Thomas, Alan Michael, Frederik Pedersen, Anna McLauchlan, Danny Saunders, Alex Pollard, Clare Stephenson, Lorna Macintyre,Gregor wright, Laurence Figgis, Charlie Hammond, Nick Evans Lotte Gertz, Lucy McEachan, Lynn Hynd, Iain Hetherington, Michael Hill Johnston, Michael Stumpf, Cara Tolmie Esq, Morag Keil, Giles Bailey, Laura Aldridge, tim Facey, Victoria Skogsberg, Salomeh Grace, Levi Hanes, Helen Tubridy, Conal McStravick, ‚ÄúJENS‚Äù Sssssssssssttttraandberg!!!, Rebecca Wilcox, Tom Varley, Amelia Bywater, Mark BRIGGSY Briggs, Carrie Skinner, Claire and Guiseppe Shallcross and Mistretta, Chris Dyson, Darren Rhymes, Hannes Hellstrom, Emilia Muller-Ginorio, Kari Robertson, John Nicol, Nick Thomas, Gordon ‚ÄúThe Disappointment‚Äù Douglas, Jennifer Bailey, Josee Aubin Ouellette, Sophie Pitt, Joe Sloan, Adam Lewis-Jacob, Alex Sarkisian, Winnie Herbstein, andrew black, Camara Taylor, Alberta Whittle, Sophie Mackfall, Nima Sene, Ashanti Harris, Adam Benmakhlouf, Thulani Rachia, Sophie Mackfall, Elaine Ang, Katherine Ka Yi Liu, Samar Ziadat, Myriam Mouflih, Colm Guo-Lin Peare, Zo√´ Guthrie.

Plot  The film is set in the village of Ryazan in Russia. It opens in Spring, 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War. The well-to-do farmer Vasilii Shironin has a daughter, Vasilisa, and a son, Ivan. While Ivan's love towards Anna was by luck also Vasilii's choice for his bride, Vasilisa's love towards Nicolai was strongly opposed by Vasilii. Before the general mobilization in Russia, Ivan is married to Anna while Vasilisa leaves home to start her family with Nicolai without the formal marriage. Vasilisa and Nicolai openly defies the conservative villagers' gossiping. When the war breaks out in the summer, both Ivan and Nicolai were drafted. Meanwhile, Vasilii rapes Anna after getting drunk, and a child is born during Ivan's absence. After the war, Nicolai comes back to the village while Ivan remains missing. Now we are in the post revolutionary era, when Vasilisa's standing is drastically improved. Her plan of orphanage is approved by the mayor and a deserted mansion is assigned to her for that purpose. When Ivan's letter finally arrives, we learn that he has been a prison of war and will return home soon. Upon see Anna with a child, he is devastated and does nothing to sooth Anna, who in desperation jumps into the river and kills herself. When her body is brought back to the farm, Visilisa tells Ivan to ask his father about the real cause of this incident. She then carries the child away to her orphanage.

Edward Wilkes Rathbun, 1898 The son of Hugo Burghardt Rathbun and Louisa Storm, he was born in Auburn, New York, was educated in New York City and worked for a trading company based in New York City. In 1862, Rathbun came to Mill Point (later Deseronto) in Canada West where his father had established a sawmill operation. In 1864, he became manager for his father's company. The sawmill was destroyed by fire in 1872 and a larger sawmill was built. The company could draw on 575 square miles (1489 km2) of timber limits to produce lumber. Rathbun became president and general manager of the company in 1883; following the death of his father in 1886, he became sole owner. He had also expanded into other businesses: a shipyard, a flour mill, a cedar mill, a cement works, a steamship company and a sash, blind and door factory. The Deseronto Gas Works produced gas for lighting from the sawdust that was a by-product of the sawmill operation. In 1883, he took over the Napanee, Tamworth and Quebec Railway to facilitate transportation of raw materials and manufactured goods; it was expanded to become the Bay of Quinte Railway. Rathbun also established a railway-car works, a terracotta plant, a wood-distillation works which produced charcoal and alcohol and an iron-smelting furnace. By 1900, Rathbun had become a millionaire. Rathbun served as Deseronto mayor from 1889 until his death in 1903. The Rathbun company paid close to half of the municipal taxes in Deseronto; the family donated land for the town cemetery, concert hall, park and church. Although he never ran for provincial or federal office, Rathbun maintained close ties to powerful players in the governments of Ontario and Canada, such as Richard John Cartwright, Alexander Campbell and Oliver Mowat. He was married twice: first to Elizabeth How Burt in 1863 and then to Bunella McMurrich, the daughter of John McMurrich, in 1873. Rathbun died in Deseronto at the age of 61. His son Walter took over the operation of the company.

This marsh-marigold species belongs to the buttercup family, grows in moist alpine fields and is native to the eastern Himalayas and the mountains on the eastern margin of the Tibetan highland. Description Caltha scaposa has flowers on stems that grow on after flowering from 7 to 24 cm high, with a thick rootstock that branches into many main roots. Its leaves are in a rosette and consist of a leafstalk and a leafblade. The leafstalk is up to 10 cm long, and has a narrow, membranous and about 2¬Ω cm long sheath at the base. The leafblade is long hart-shaped or sometimes kidney-shaped (1¬Ω-3¬Ω x 1‚Äì3 cm), with a blunt tip and an entire, scalloped or tooth-bearing margin. Mostly there are several flowering stems in each plant, which sometimes carry one, small, leaflike stipule and usually one, rarely 2 flowers of about 2¬Ω cm across. As all marsh-marigolds, it lacks petals, but the five to nine (most often six) sepals are petal-like, strikingly yellow, inverted egg-shaped with a blunt tip, 10-15 x 6‚Äì8 mm. There are between twenty and forty stamens with flattened yellow filaments that carry yellow pollen, and encircle between ten and twenty carpels which are linear-oblong and prolonged into the persistent style, topped by an oblique and curved stigma. After pollination, the carpels develop into follicles of about 10x3 mm on 1¬Ω-3 mm long stalks. They may contain three to six ovoid, black seeds. Flowering occurs between June and August. = Differences with related species = C. scaposa differs from C. palustris that co-occurs with it over its entire distribution area because it is much smaller (usually below 20 cm versus usually over 30 cm), leaves are much smaller (1‚Äì4 cm compared to 3‚Äì25 cm long), flowers are usually solitary (but sometimes with two) with twenty to forty stamens, on a stem that mostly is nude, but occasionally has one small stipule (in C. palustris flowers have fifty to one hundred twenty stamens and are usually with four to nine on a stem that has several stipules, although one or two flowers per stem sometimes occur). The most conclusive difference is the stipitate (stalked) follicles in C. scaposa which are sessile (seated) in C. palustris. The general hart- or kidney-shape of the leaves and the yolk yellow of the flowers are shared characters. C. natans is a floating species with leaves along the rooting stems and with white or pink flowers of less than 1¬Ω cm. Caltha leptosepala that occurs in western North- America mostly has white flowers, and the rare yellow-flowered variety has lanceolate sepals. Distribution This species grows in moist alpine meadows and marshy streamsides, in the Himalayas between 3800‚Äì4600 m, and in China 2800‚Äì4100 m high. It can be found in India (Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal, Bhutan, southeastern Tibet and China (southern Gansu, southern Qinghai, western Sichuan, northwestern Yunnan).  Taxonomy  Caltha scaposa is most closely related to the common marsh-marigold C. palustris, with which it composes the Caltha-section.

They subsequently had three children; and by 1950 she seemed settled into an established family life, the traditional course for most wives and mothers at the time. One day, however, an incidental social contact at a local charity event changed the course of Green's life and destined her for a career in entertainment. In the coastal neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in western Los Angeles, while volunteering her time to model clothes in a fashion show to raise money for a charity, she impressed the wife of a local talent agent. The woman mentioned Green to her husband, who soon contacted her. The agent too was impressed with Green's beauty and poise, and he encouraged her to pursue acting. She initially hesitated to do so; but her husband encouraged her as well to give acting a try. She did; and after a few months of training with a drama coach, Green began performing on stage for the Manhattan Playhouse, a theater group located near her home in Manhattan Beach. Her first role was that of \\"Irene\\" in the group's production of Light Up the Sky by Moss Hart. Film & television career After some additional performances in other productions presented by the Manhattan Playhouse, Green got her first professional job on television, on a live broadcast of the Jack Benny Program, in April 1953.

The Wawa Hotel was a large summer resort hotel located at Norway Point on Lake of Bays, in Ontario, Canada. Constructed in 1908, it was entirely destroyed by a fire on August 19th, 1923. The name \\"Wawa\\" is a native Canadian word for \\"wild goose\\".  History  A view of Norway Point on Lake of Bays, taken before the 1908 construction of the Wawa Hotel. The settlement in the area was called Gordon's Corners at the time. The land on which the Wawa was later built was originally thickly wooded; First Nations groups knew and likely camped in the area, as evidenced by an arrowhead found on the point itself. In the late 1870s there was already a small community with a church, a schoolhouse and a post office in the area. Around this time, the site of the later Wawa Hotel was cleared and settled by John Wilson Robertson, a coal merchant from Edinburgh, and his family. As other farmers in the region also discovered, the Robertsons found the land to be challenging to work, as the soil consisted primarily of sand with many stones and little humus. By the turn of the 20th century, the main economy of the area had begun to transition from farming to tourism. With steamboats and the Portage Railway of the Huntsville and Lake of Bays Transportation Company connecting Lake of Bays to the Grand Trunk Railway, access from the larger cities of southern Ontario became much easier. As this transition continued, more and more hotels and private cottages continued to spring up. Mrs. Elizabeth Robertson (n√©e Forest) hosted the first guests in her house at the future site of the Wawa around this time, and continued to do so until the land was purchased from her by the Canadian Railway News Company in order to build the Wawa.  Description  The Wawa Hotel under Construction, as seen from the cliff behind Norway Point. Built in 1908, the Wawa hotel was a wooden structure consisting of a three-story centre block flanked by a pair of two story wings. The centre block was capped by a five-story tower featuring a powerful electric searchlight (a novelty at the time) and housed the main rotunda and a dining room with capacity for 300 people. The wings had rooms on two floors, with the entire hotel having a total 153 rooms. The accommodations were considered luxurious at the time, with hot and cold running water in every room, electric light throughout the hotel, and many rooms featuring en suite bathrooms. The rooms, the majority of which were 4.3 m x 4.9 m (14 feet x 16 feet), were said to be larger than average for similar summer hotels. Numerous activities were available to the guests, such as sailing, canoeing, swimming, tennis, baseball, football, bowls and quoits.  Location  The Wawa Hotel was situated on a piece of property including and extending out to the south of Norway Point, approximately midway between the towns of Baysville and Dorset.Google Maps satellite view of the Wawa site The property is flat, with a broad, sandy beach with a western exposure extending along its entire length. A 46 m (150 foot) cliff rises behind the property, upon which foundations for what was likely a water tank can still be found. Access to the Wawa was difficult by modern standards, with a trip from Toronto taking 8.5 hours in 1919. The trip involved taking a train to Huntsville, a steamer to the portage railway between Peninsula Lake and Lake of Bays, and then a second steamer from there to the Wawa dock. For comparison, the same trip today takes approximately 2.5 hours by car.  Destruction  On the night of August 19th, 1923, fire broke out in the centre block, originating either in the elevator shaft or the adjacent baggage room. It quickly spread throughout the wooden structure, and reduced it to ashes in under half an hour. 8 people, all women, were killed in the immediate course of the blaze, with a 9th woman dying four days later as a result of her injuries, Several of the women who died were maids, sleeping in the bedrooms in the central tower, directly above where the flames originated. Inquiries and investigations held after the fire revealed that there had been no fire alarm installed in the building, no signed escape routes and only inadequate fire-fighting equipment. In addition to this, the fire hydrants in the building were rendered useless because the water supply had been shut off at the main valve in the kitchen. Fire escapes from upper floor rooms mainly consisted of ropes, and even these were not provided in the rooms of the centre tower.  Legacy  The destruction of the Wawa by fire, like many similar hotels of the era, led to an increased emphasis being placed on fire safety in newer establishments. The next large hotel to be built on Lake of Bays, the Bigwin Inn, advertised itself as being fireproof, with many of its buildings being built of stone and concrete, instead of the otherwise ubiquitous wood. In addition to this, the Bigwin Inn comprised several separate buildings in order to prevent the spread of fire, a measure which was also recommended by a jury in the wake of the Wawa fire. A view of Lake of Bays as seen from the former property of the Wawa Hotel in 2009 After the fire, C.O. Shaw, owner of the Bigwin Inn, purchased the land and then sold it to private individuals, including Frank Leslie (later owner of the Bigwin Inn) and James Watson Bain, son of James Bain, the first chief librarian of the Toronto Public Library. The Leslie cottage is now owned by Graeme Ferguson. One of only two surviving Wawa structures still stands on this property, a white gazebo set on Norway Point. The other structure which survived the fire is the purser's cabin from the end of the Wawa dock, which now serves as a railway station on the restored portage railway. The cribs from the original Wawa dock are still in place, but now present a slight navigational hazard as they are entirely underwater.

Description and history The Washington County Courthouse is located at the corner of Cooper and Court Streets in the center of Machias, between the Washington County Jail (to which it is now attached by a modern ell) and the local post office. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof and granite foundation. The roof is topped by a square tower whose second stage is an open belfry with round-arch openings and pilastered corners, with a bracketed cornice above. The front-facing gable is fully pedimented, with modillioned and dentillated eaves and cornice, and a round window at the center of the triangular pediment. First floor windows are set in segmented-arch openings that are surrounded by recessed panels. Second floor windows on the front and the first bay on the side are tall segmented- arch sash windows, that extend into the brickwork of the cornice, while other windows on the sides are shorter round-arch sash. The first and second floors are separated by a granite stringcourse, and the second-floor bays are articulated by brick pilasters. The courthouse was built in 1853 to a design by Bangor architect Benjamin S. Deane, an apparently self-trained architect originally from Thomaston. Deane is one of the first professional architects known to be working in Down East Maine, and is also credited with the Waldo County courthouse, a similar transitional Greek Revival-Italianate design.

Discovery and naming Limb bones A fossil of a large sauropod was discovered by the Argentine paleontologist Dr. Bernardo Javier Gonz√°lez Riga in Mendoza province In 2016, the type species Notocolossus gonzalezparejasi was named and described by Bernardo Javier Gonz√°lez Riga, Matthew Carl Lamanna, Leonardo Daniel Ortiz David, Jorge Orlando Calvo and Juan P. Coria. The generic name combines the Greek words ŒΩœåœÑŒøœÇ, notos, \\"south wind\\", and Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÉœÉœåœÇ, kolossos, \\"giant statue\\", in reference to the provenance from the Southern Hemisphere and the gigantic size of the animal. The specific name honours Jorge Gonz√°lez Parejas, for having studied the dinosaur fossils of Mendoza province for two decades. The holotype, UNCUYO-LD 301, was found in a layer of the Plottier Formation dating from the Coniacian-Santonian, about eighty-six million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains an anterior back vertebra, an anterior tail vertebra, a right humerus and the upper part of a left pubic bone. Although the bones have not been discovered in articulation, they were considered to represent a single individual because they were found in close association on a surface of eight by eight metres. A second partial skeleton lacking the skull was referred to Notocolossus: specimen UNCUYO-LD 302 representing a smaller individual. It contains a series of five anterior tail vertebrae and a complete right foot connected to an astragalus. It was recovered on a distance of 403 metres to the holotype from a surface of five by five metres. Description Vertebral bones The evidence suggests that Notocolossus was among the largest titanosaurs, and therefore one of the heaviest land animals, yet discovered. Although the incompleteness of the skeleton of the new sauropod has prevented scientists from making precise estimates of its size, its humerus, or upper arm bone, is in length, which is longer than that of any other titanosaur for which this bone is known, including other giants such as Dreadnoughtus, Futalognkosaurus, and Paralititan.They also estimated the total femur length at ,by using an allometric equation. If, as is likely, the body proportions of Notocolossus were comparable to those of better preserved titanosaurs, the new dinosaur may have weighed in the range of , most likely . In 2019 Gregory S. Paul estimated the mass of Notocolossus in the 45-55 tonne (49.6-60.6 short tons) range with the possibility that it might have been larger than that or approaching the mass of Argentinosaurus, which was estimated at 65-75 tonnes (71.6-82.7 short tons). This claim though, is considered unlikely . In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi estimated its length at and its weight at 40 tonnes (44 short tons). Reconstruction of Notocolossus gonzalesparejasi In 2016, several distinguishing traits of Notocolossus were determined. Nine of these were autapomorphies, unique derived qualities. At the anterior back vertebra, the depression between the front edge of the side process and the lower edge of the side process is divided by two accessory ridges, one of which runs vertically while the other crosses the first horizontally. On the front side of the neural spines of the front tail vertebrae, run vertical ridges fusing at their lower ends, above the level of the front joint processes, creating a V-shaped structure. The upper inner corner of the humerus is strongly expanded, extending far beyond the inner side of the shaft. The humerus has in general a strongly expanded upper edge, 2.9 wider than the shaft diameter. On the humerus shaft, below the scar for the musculus coracobrachialis, runs a diagonal ridge, from the upper and outer side to the inner and lower side. The first metatarsal has an upper width exceeding its length. The third metatarsal is relatively short with 1.2 times the length of the first metatarsal. The upper toe phalanges are 50% wider at their tops than their respective metatarsals are long. The toe claws are reduced, rough and truncated. The foot or pes of Notocolossus, a skeleton part that is not often preserved in sauropods, shows a unique build. It contains a compact, homogeneous metatarsus, thought to be adapted for bearing extraordinary weight. It also presents truncated unguals, characteristics otherwise unknown in the Sauropoda. This parallels the vertical position of the metacarpals and the finger reduction in the hand of other titanosaurs. Phylogeny Notocolossus belongs to the clade Titanosauria, a very diverse group of sauropods. In 2016, a cladistic analysis recovered Notocolossus as a basal member of Lithostrotia and a sister species of Dreadnoughtus. A 2017 study by Carballido and colleagues recovered it as the sister taxon of Lognkosauria and found it to be outside of Lithostrotia. In 2018, Gonz√°lez Riga and colleagues found it to belong to Lognkosauria, in a polytomy with Patagotitan and Puertasaurus. This analysis also found Longkosauria to belong to Lithostrotia. The following cladogram shows the position of Notocolossus in Lognkosauria according to Gonzalez Riga and colleagues, 2018. Paleoecology Notocolossus was discvoered in the Plottier Formation of the Neuqu√©n Group. This formation is about thick and composed of light red claystones and thin bands of pink sandstone. The Plottier Formation can be differentiated from the overlying Portezuelo Formation by the former's higher content of argillite. Tetrapods of the Plottier formation are poorly known. They are represented by mammals, a large coelurosaur, and several titanosaurs. These titanosaurs, in addition to Notocolossus, include Petrobrasaurus, \\"Antarctosaurus\\" giganteus, and two additional specimens, one of which appears to be an aeolosaurine. Additionally Muyelensaurus is sometimes stated to come from this formation, although it may actually be from the aforementioned Portezuelo Formation instead.

Early life and family  Smyth was born in Glasgow in 1880. She was born to Elizabeth Ramage and a jute manufacturer, William Hugh Smyth. Her parents originated from France and Ireland, respectively. Despite the family moved to Manchester in the 1880s, Smyth returned to Glasgow to study, as did her sister. Smyth had two sisters; Olive (1882-1949) was also a Glasgow artist while Rose was a composer. Smyth lived with her sisters for much of her life.  Education  The Glasgow School of Art, where Smyth studied. Between 1885-1893 Smyth attended the Colonel Clark's School in Manchester and the Manchester High School for Girls. She studied under Walter Crane at the Manchester School of Art between 1893‚Äì97, and at the Glasgow School of Art between 1898 -1904. At the latter she studied drawing, painting and stained glass but focused mainly on theatre and costume design.  Career  In 1901 Smyth's stained glass window Tristan and Iseult was exhibited at the Glasgow International Exhibition. Following her graduation from the Glasgow School of Art she worked in theatre in Stockholm, Paris and London. In 1921, aged 41, she painted Self Portrait. This piece shows her in her studio with brushes, canvas and paint palette, and smiling at the onlooker. Olive Carleton Smyth presented the painting to Glasgow Museums in 1948. In 1903 an anonymous donor allowed her to travel in Florence and Paris, having earlier paid for her to be a member of the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists in 1902. She regularly exhibited with this group, as well as exhibiting with her dealer Craibe Angus. In 1903, she was commissioned by Glasgow dealer Craibe Angus to exhibit in Turin, Cork, Toronto and Budapest. In 1914, she returned to GSA to teach, and became head of the Commercial Art Department, in which position she remained until 1933. Smyth's sister Olive taught fashion. She was highly praised and supported by Fra Newbury. Her circle has posthumously been described as the 'Glasgow Girls' group of artists. Smyth also designed costumes for a number of Shakespearean festivals in Stratford. In 1933, Smyth was offered the position of Director of the Glasgow School of Art, which she accepted. However she died on 16 February that same year. W.O. Hutchinson took up the role instead and Smyth's sister, Olive, took up the position of Head of Design at GSA.

Robinson for working fast goods and fish trains. They passed to the London and North Eastern Railway at the 1923 grouping and received the classification 'B4'. Design The new design was very similar to 4-6-0 the two locomotives of the (GCR Class 8C, later LNER class B1) except that they had smaller driving wheels. They were built with a saturated boiler, inside slide valves and Stephenson valve gear, two outside cylinders connected to diameter driving wheels. LNER ownership The ten locomotives were renumbered by the LNER by adding 5000 to their GCR numbers; and classified as B4. Modifications Between 1925 and 1928 the whole class received superheated boilers, but six received 10-inch piston valves and 21-inch cylinders giving rise to two LNER sub-classes B4/1 and B4/2. The LNER had designed a new type of superheated boiler (Diagram 16) based on the old design (Diagram 15). These were used on the B1 and B4 class locomotives; no more of this type of boiler was made after 1932, and so to keep the B1 and B4s in service during World War II, some Diagram 15 boilers were modified for use with these locomotives. Allocation and work The class were originally used on fish trains between the port of Grimsby and London and Manchester although they were also found to be successful passenger locomotives. The first locomotive No. 1095 was also chosen to haul the special train at the inauguration ceremony for the new port of Immingham in 1906, and was named ‚ÄòImmingham‚Äô thereafter.

She worked on various commissions as a costume and stage designer, and as an illustrator and model.  Childhood  Isabel Dalziel Brodie was born 5 in Glasgow where her father was a decorative metal worker in the city's shipyards and who encouraged her artistic abilities from a young age.  Glasgow School of Art  Glasgow School of Art, where Babianska studied. As encouraged by her father, she studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1936 to 1940. In 1939 she was awarded a travelling scholarship to London, however as war was declared shortly afterwards she remained in Glasgow, returning the scholarship money. The same year she exhibited a self-portrait, titled 'Reflection' at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, which, in 1940, was purchased by Glasgow City Council for Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. This painting depicts the artist at the side of her easel, paintbrushes in hand. On graduating from Glasgow, she studied at the Hospitalfield School of Art during 1941.  Career  In 1941 she was commissioned by Glasgow Corporation to design and paint murals at the YMCA headquarters in Bath Street. She was helped by her close friend Marie de Banzie. Together they collaborated in the design of costume and stage sets for the Celtic Ballet, including Macbeth, Conte Russes, L'Obsession, Tam O'Shanter, Cloak of Feathers and a Ballet of the Book of the Dead amongst others. She also illustrated Scottish Art and Letters, and designed the cover for Poetry Scotland No.2. She was a founder member of New Art Club and the New Scottish Group along with J.D. Fergusson as President, exhibiting regularly with NSG. Writing about the group's second show in 1944, art critic Robert Melville observed: > \\"Isabel Babianska and Marie de Banzie obviously work in close association, > and are the most restless and experimental members of the group. They are > the products of the Glasgow Art School, and in some of their works they very > effectively employ the Gauguin-Wyndham Lewis synthesis which determines the > style of Robert Colquhon, an artist from the same school, whose work has > been exhibited in London. Their response to Jankel Adler has produced some > dynamic paintings of war-machines in action, but it is in their portraits > that they are particularly outstanding, and their interest in the expressive > stylisation of the features of the human face will probably be responsible > for their most significant work; they seem less inhibited and more soundly > equipped for the approach to Picasso's special territory than most of the > painters who have ventured near that field. Glasgow has reason to be proud > of her young painters.\\" Babianska also exhibited at the 1947 Edinburgh International Festival, Murrayfield, at the Society of Independent Scottish Artists. She continued to paint in London, and also worked successfully as a photographic fashion model, for agencies including Dior and , and was featured on the cover of various fashion magazines, including Vogue. She ran Whittaker Model Agency, inherited from her friend Michael Whittaker, until she died in 2006.  Personal life  Her early work is signed in her maiden name, Isabel Brodie. In 1943 she married Count Tomasz Babianski, a Polish pilot officer. Thereafter she exhibited as Isabel Babianska. She had two daughters, named Monica and Irena.

A natural colourist, she is most celebrated as a portrait painter. The RSA building, where Beatrice Huntington exhibited regularly, viewed from the south Early life and education Beatrice Huntington was born in St Andrews, Fife, in 1889. Her father was a surgeon, Dr William Huntington. In 1906, aged seventeen, she moved to Paris, \\"through the good offices of her mother\\", to begin training at the Heinrich Knirr painting school. Knirr described Huntington as a \\"quite wonderful artistic phenomenon\\". Thereafter, she studied drawing in Munich and drawing remained a significant part in her work in later life. In 1914, she moved to London and exhibited her work with the Society of Women Artists and the International Society of Sculptors, Painters & Gravers. Post First World War After the end of World War One, in 1919, Huntington had her portrait, Mrs Mappin hung at the International in Paris during the last year that Degas was president. Returning to St. Andrews, Huntington went on to study in Dundee under William Macdonald. In 1920, Huntington became a member of the Society of Scottish Artists. An article in the Times in 1923, noted Huntington's work at the Scottish Artists' Society exhibition in Edinburgh that year in saying: \\"Prominent among the figure work are Alec Walker's \\"Queen and Page\\", a nude by David Foggie and Miss Beatrice Huntington's study of a Spaniard.\\" During this period, Huntington also exhibited at the Allied Artists Association in London and with the Dundee Art Society. In 1924, already an accomplished musician, Huntington studied under the cellist Julius Klengel in Leipzig. The following year, William Macdonald and Huntington married and an exhibition of both their work was held in 1928, at Messrs Watt & Sons, Dundee. In 1929, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Julius, and moved to live in a flat in Hanover Street, Edinburgh. This flat was to remain their home for the rest of their lives. Period most active: 1930s‚Äì1940s Huntington and her husband spent large amounts of time in Spain, France and Canada. So much so that Macdonald was bestowed the nickname of 'Spanish Macdonald'. The influence of these trips are reflected in some of her work; notably A Muleteer from Andalucia. Her work in this middle part of her life (e.g. Artist's Model and Scottish Midwife) are thought to show elements of the cubist approach as they \\"are strongly expressive in the geometrical arrangement of colour echoing the language of cubism.\\" During the 1930s‚Äì40s, Huntington regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and Royal Scottish Academy. She was a member of the hanging committee at the Royal Scottish Academy until she resigned on a point of principle before the outbreak of World War Two. Later life Following the end of the Second World War, Huntington started exhibiting with the Scottish Society of Women Artists. However, due to her husband suffering from a prolonged bout of ill health, Huntington spent much of her time nursing him and was unable to do much painting in this period as a result. Macdonald died in 1960. In the decades which followed, Huntington set up a salon which young people were invited to visit and took up portraiture once more. She died in her sleep in 1988, aged ninety-nine.

Sam Neill and Julian Dennison play \\"Uncle\\" Hector and Ricky Baker, a father figure and foster son who become the targets of a manhunt after fleeing into the New Zealand bush. Carthew Neal, Leanne Saunders, Matt Noonan, and Waititi produced the film. The film premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on 22 January 2016. The film opened across New Zealand on 31 March 2016. The film received a limited North American release on 24 June 2016. The film received critical acclaim, with many critics highlighting Dennison and Neill's performances and chemistry. Plot Ricky Baker, a juvenile delinquent who was abandoned by his mother, is taken by child welfare services officer Paula and police officer Andy, to live in a remote farm with foster mother Bella Faulkner and her husband, the cantankerous southern man Hec. Hec is remote, but Bella quickly manages to break through Ricky's defensive shell by taking him hunting and giving him a dog for his 13th birthday, which he names Tupac after his idol Tupac Shakur. When Bella suddenly dies and Hec tells Ricky that child services will take him back, Ricky ineptly fakes his suicide by burning a barn and runs away into the bush with Tupac, where he is completely unable to cope and gets lost. Hec finds him easily but breaks his ankle in a fall, forcing the two to camp for a period of time. The authorities meanwhile have found the house empty and the barn burnt down, and come to the conclusion that the bereaved and mentally unstable Hec has abducted Ricky. The impression is strengthened after an encounter with three foolish hunters who get the idea that Hec is molesting Ricky. Hec reveals to Ricky that he has served prison time for manslaughter and is illiterate. Ricky, in turn, says his only friend in foster care has died and that his only options are risking the same fate in the foster system, or serve time in juvenile prison. The pair agree to disappear into the bush. A national manhunt ensues, and the two slowly bond while working together to escape arrest. Upon finding another hut, they encounter an unconscious, diabetic ranger. Ricky leaves to find help and runs into a girl his age named Kahu. She takes him back to her house and introduces him to her dad. Ricky stays the night and returns the next morning to the hut where Hec was supposed to be. Ricky finds the place to be swarming with police, led by Paula. Ricky runs away. He later encounters Paula and Andy in the bush, separated by a ravine. Paula attempts to bribe Ricky, asking him to say that Hec was a sex offender. In return, she tells him that he will not ever go to juvenile prison. Ricky declines and runs away. Ricky catches up to Hec by remembering the survival strategies Hec taught him, and they continue their travels. They encounter a wild boar that mortally wounds Hec's dog Zag, forcing Hec to euthanize him. Ricky reveals he has been carrying Bella's ashes and originally planned to deliver them to \\"where the earth wets the cloak of the sky,\\" as per her wishes. They bury Zag and scatter Bella's ashes into a remote waterfall high in a mountain range. Ricky and Hec find a man living out on his own called Psycho Sam. Sam lets them stay the night. After five months of surviving in the wilderness and several close calls, they are finally caught following a car and helicopter chase, and Ricky accidentally shoots Hec. Hec gets remanded and Ricky is taken in by Kahu's family. After Hec's release from jail, Ricky, with his new foster family's permission, returns to the bush with Hec to photograph the huia, an extinct bird they had re-discovered during their time on the run.

In 1928 he sees a woman in a passing train, and suddenly remembers his own history. He decides to leave for his hometown, St. Petersburg, now renamed to Leningrad. He is confused by the rapid changes in modern Leningrad and gets a job at his old workplace, where he slowly realises what it means that peasants are now in charge of the factory. His co-workers find the new address of his wife and send him there. Filimonov is confronted by the fact that his wife is now married to a Soviet apparatchik who treats her badly. In the final scene, Filimonov breaks the fourth wall and declares to the audience that there is still a lot of work to be done.  Restoration  The movie was restored in 2018 by an international team of silent movie experts, including San Francisco Silent Film Festival board president Robert Byrne and Peter Bagrov, a former archivist from the Russian Gosfilmofond. The restoration was primarily based on a 35mm print from the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A couple of missing shots and intertitles were taken from a print sourced from the Swiss Cin√©math√®que. Crucially, the scene where Jesus on the crucifix is shown with a gas mask was inserted again. A new soundtrack was composed for the Dutch premiere at the EYE Filmmuseum by Colin Benders, using a Eurorack modular synthesizer.

Born in Hillhead, Glasgow to a Scottish father and English mother and she spent most of her life in Glasgow. Best known for her painting and embroidering she also worked in a range of mediums such as leather, book binding and also painted china. Education and career Brown studied at Glasgow School of Art, GSA, from 1894 to 1901 under directorship of the progressive Fra. H Newbery. She was a student of Ann Macbeth at GSA and then went on to teach art embroidery to teachers at GSA from 1904 to 1907 (embroidery being an important part of GSA craft at that time) and then book binding from 1911 to 1913. It was whilst studying at GSA that she met her good friend Jessie M. King who she shared a studio flat with at 101 St Vincent Street, Glasgow from around 1898 until 1907 when King got married. The women's friendship was longlasting and strong despite the different trajectories of their careers. King attracted international acclaim but despite some early notice Brown had less success. The two women often modelled for each other and were inseparable companions during the years they lived together. After GSA Brown went to Paris to attend sketching classes and was an admirer of the free style of French Impressionists and would continue to visit Paris throughout her career. Her work mainly captures people out enjoying life, capturing atmosphere and caf√© scenes (reflecting her interest in fashion and clothes), but she also painted landscapes and flowers too. She is quoted as saying that she chose embroidery because she enjoyed \\"playing with colour\\" but also because it would sell as \\"art for art's sake is the road to starvation nowadays\\". She was reportedly vivacious and noted for her witty wisecracks In the 1900s Patrick Geddes and Fra Newberry led a number of Scottish masques and pageants relating to Pan- Celtic events involving a range of Arts and Crafts designers from Edinburgh and Glasgow. Helen Paxton Brown was involved in the \\"historical\\" pageant production at Glasgow University.  Exhibitions and Commissions  Glasgow School of Art Brown joined \\"The Glasgow Society of Artists\\" (started by physician Alexander Frew, husband of painter Bessie MacNicol) which women could join unlike the all-male Glasgow Art Club. Although short-lived, the society provided an alternative for those painters dissatisfied with the Glasgow establishment. She was also a member of the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists from 1905 and became an honorary member in 1948 where her work could often be found as well as at the Glasgow Art Institute. From 1920s Brown started using more bright colours and bolder designs in both her painting and embroidery. This development was shown in a joint exhibition with Jessie M King at the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists‚Äô exhibition in April 1931 called \\"Spring in Three Room\\" which not only showed their paintings but saw them taking over three rooms which were decorated in bright yellows and creams showing different home decoration, in stark contrast to the then contemporary style of dark furniture. Jessie M King and Paxton Brown exhibited their work on several occasions together. In 1925 she received a commission from Mount Blow, Dalmuir to paint 12 mural panels of nursery rhymes, through the Glasgow Corporation Welfare Scheme. Examples of her work can now be seen in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow.

She combines traditional forms of Cape Verde with contemporary and traditional jazz. Biography Carmen Souza was born in Lisbon on 20 May 1981, to parents who had moved to Portugal after the Carnation Revolution ended the colonial era of their native Cape Verde. Though Souza has only been to Cape Verde herself a few times, once on a family trip when she was ten and again as an adult in 2010, she grew up speaking Creole and eating Cape Verdean cuisine. While still a child, she began singing gospel music in the church choir. Her parents maintained close ties with the diaspora, and Souza's childhood was filled with the music and culture of Cape Verde, along with that of the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Brazil, Mozambique and S√£o Tom√©. Souza's father, Antonio, a merchant sailor, insisted she should learn English and German. After spending just one year at college, she left to pursue her music career. In 1999, Souza began partnering with bassist Theo Pas'cal, who has been a mentor to her and continues to perform with her. They met when she came to audition for a music project Pas'cal was directing and initially she performed professionally with him in a Portuguese- language gospel choir. Souza plays piano and guitar, writes or co-writes her songs with Pas'cal and sings. In 2003 they began working on a style which combined Cape Verde Creole music, including the batuque, coladeira, and morna genres, with contemporary jazz. Souza usually sings in Creole because its variants allow her a flexibility for the language to meld with different cadences, than more formal languages allow. But she also sings in English, French, and Portuguese. Her voice is \\"alternately chirpy and grave.\\" Africa Today described her as having a \\"soul diva voice\\". Souza's work transforms the traditional Cape Verde morna, adding jazz and personal invention, such as vocal experiments, using her pitch and tone to emulate musical instruments. Her debut album, released in 2005, titled Ess √™ nha Cabo Verde, was their first West African-jazz blend adapted to an acoustic vibe. Souza's second release was Verdade (Truth), in 2008. Featuring the duo's blend of African and jazz music set to Wurlitzer electric piano and guitar, it won wide critical acclaim. A re-release of the album in 2010 by Galileo Records was included in several best world music lists for the year. Three years later, they followed up the success with Protegid (Protected), featuring Cuban pianist Omar Sosa and French accordionist with Souza on Rhodes piano, guitar, and vocals. Protegid blends Cape Verdean music with traditional jazz and includes updates on jazz standards. The album was nominated for the German Record Critic's Award and earned a ranking on the World Music Charts Europe (WMCE). Souza chose to donate half of the proceeds of her 2012 album Duo (also known as London Acoustic Set) to charity. Most of the album was recorded at the Green Note Club in London with two tracks which had been produced in 2010 at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall. All of the tracks had been previously released on her other albums, but all were new, live interpretations. Kachupada, named after a type of Cape Verdean food, kachupa, was her fifth album and was released the following year. Kachupada includes her version of two jazz classics, \\"Donna Lee\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\". She followed with an album released in 2014 called Live at Lagny Jazz Festival which features musicians Ben Burrell on piano, Elias Kacomanolis on drums and percussion, and her music partner Pas'cal, playing acoustic and electric bass. Souza's accolades for the album included \\"one of the most talented and innovative vocalists in the present-day jazz and world music scene\\". Souza resides in London.  Live performances  The positive response to her first album led to international recognition, when she performed at the World of Music, Arts and Dance Festival (WOMAD) held that year in Reading, Berkshire, England. She performed in Ireland at the Farmleigh Affair Festival in 2008, despite the bad weather and the following year was noted for bringing \\"a sultry jazz swing to the bluesy morna of her Cape Verde Islands homeland\\" in a Toronto performance which was part of a North American tour. In 2010, she played at the North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam, the London African Music Festival, and the Leverkusener Jazztage Festival, in Leverkusen. In Leverkusen, Souza was one of the headliners and her performance was later broadcast by Westdeutscher Rundfunk/3SAT TV. Souza performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. in 2011 and at the Kriol Jazz Festival in Praia, Cape Verde, in 2013. Later that same year, she performed at the WOMAD Festival in C√°ceres: her first visit to Spain. She toured afterwards in Barcelona, Madrid, and Zaragoza before an appearance at the Regattabar in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carmen Souza performed on 23 June 2016 at the Gibraltar World Music Festival in St. Michael's Cave.

Built around a small farmhouse dating to , the house was substantially extended in William and Mary style by architect Edwin Lutyens , and further extended by him in vernacular style . It is a Grade I listed building. The gardens, designed by Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll, are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. They are among the best-known gardens of the Lutyens/Jekyll partnership.Brown (1982), pp. 93‚Äì5. House The neoclassical hall, 1921 Around 1906, Lutyens extended the 17th-century, timbered cottage for H. H. Cochrane, using grey brick dressed with red brick and ashlar, in William and Mary style. The addition is H-shaped. The interior of the H's centre, which aligns east-west, is occupied by a two-storey, neoclassical style hall, which Lutyens painted black. The original cottage, which Lutyens connected to the northwest corner of the new house, became a service wing.Gradidge (1981), pp. 60‚Äì2. Around 1912, Lutyens created the vernacular addition for new owners of the house, Zachary Merton and his wife Antonie,Brown (1996), pp. 180‚Äì3. who had both divorced from their former spouses to marry each other. Zachary Merton (born Zachary Moses) was a businessman and philanthropist. His family had founded Metallgesellschaft in Germany and Henry R. Merton and Co. in Britain, which were among the leading metal trading companies of their respective countries. Merton was a director and one of the largest shareholders of the British company. Antonie had come to England from Germany with her previous husband, Hermann Schmiechen, a portrait painter.Brown (1996), p. 106. She was a follower of theosophy, like Lutyens's wife Emily.Ridley (2002), pp. 266‚Äì7. House ground floor plan, 1921 (South front is to the right) Lutyens built the vernacular addition in red brick, with tile-hanging and weatherboarding. He extended the line of the centre of the existing H with a two-storey connecting wing, containing on each floor a corridor long and wide, leading to a much larger, new west wing, aligned north-south. The west wing's south end features a large bay window on each floor.Gradidge (1981), pp. 142‚Äì3. At ground level, the south end contains a neoclassical dining room with a huge fireplace, as high as the room. Above the dining room, the main bedroom has a sleeping balcony (for outside sleeping), built over arches, on its west side. On the east side, there is an L-shaped cloister with buttressed arches running alongside the dining room and along the south side of the connecting corridor, bordering two sides of the Tank Court and its rectangular pool. The service quarters moved to the new wing, with a circular dairy attached to its northern end. The original cottage became a billiard room. Zachary Merton died in 1915. Antonie Merton allowed Lutyens and his family to spend the summer of 1916 at Folly Farm, where they entertained Jekyll, the playwright Edward Knoblock and the painters William Nicholson and his wife Mabel Pryde. Nicholson painted a mural in the dining room during his stay. During World War II, the house served as a maternity hospital, then reverted to private ownership. The British celebrity cook Keith Floyd (1942 - 2009) was born at Folly Farm on 28 December 1943Keith Floyd. Gardens Cloister and Tank Court, 1921 The formal gardens extend to the south and west of the house, with lawns beyond. In 1906, Lutyens and Jekyll turned the area around the original cottage and its barn into a series of walled courts. To the south of the house, they created a walled kitchen garden and a rhododendron walk. The latter, running south along the eastern side of the gardens, has subsequently been replaced by a lime walk leading to a White Garden. In 1912 they placed a canal garden, with a long rectangular pool, to the south of the earlier William and Mary addition. Between the new west wing and the kitchen garden, they positioned a parterre garden, and to the west of that, a sunken rose garden. Tank Court, with its cloister and pool, has been called \\"probably Lutyens's ' in garden architecture\\". The 18th-century thatched barn, the kitchen garden and some Lutyen-designed cottages of are all Grade II listed.

Annelie Nordstr√∂m at a press conference on 20 January 2016 where she announced her resignation Nordstr√∂m received attention in January 2016 when the newspaper Aftonbladet publicized articles about the Swedish Municipal Workers' Union. People within the union had used the union funds for luxurious dinners and the hiring of porn star Puma Swede to perform a strip show at a restaurant owned by the union, which led to the dismissal of the union cashier.

Air, or other gas, may collect within plumbing. For water delivery systems to taps and basins, particularly with good main supply pressure, this air is usually flushed through with the water flow and does not cause a problem, although in some hot-water systems (particularly Gravity systems) air locks can be problematic. In a closed heating system though, it has no other means of escape and builds up. An air bubble trapped within a radiator means that no hot water circulates in the upper part and so the heating power of the radiator is reduced. If air is trapped within the boiler this may cause pump cavitation or boiling and overheating within the heat exchanger.  Installation and use  Dismantled valve components Automatic valves are used to release trapped air as it collects. They are not a substitute for bleeding a system manually when it is first filled during commissioning, nor for remedial bleeding if the system becomes choked with trapped air. In those cases, individual bleed screws on each radiator, or high pipe run, are opened manually. The valves are installed at a high point of the system, where trapped air collects. They may be installed at the highest point in a system, but in a system with pumped circulation this is rarely necessary. Instead they are placed at some local high point, such as the highest point within a utility cupboard or boiler room, even though this is in a basement. European domestic gas boilers often include such a valve within the boiler casing itself. A working system should not generate further trapped gas. Air may be drawn in if there is a small leak, or dissolved air in make-up water may come out of solution, but this generally indicates a system leak if new water is needing to be added. The most likely cause of continual gas bleeding is hydrogen, rather than air. If there is corrosion or rusting of internal metal components, this releases hydrogen gas. The appropriate cure here though is the use of a chemical inhibitor, rather than continual bleeding. The valves are normally installed with the first installation of a system, then remain in place for the life of the system. They are generally reliable and require no maintenance. If they do eventually fail, they are replaced rather than repaired. A leaking valve commonly shows a dribble of water from the air vent, or stains of rust or limescale.  Construction and valve operation = Float valves = Float valve internal operation Construction is of the usual cast brass housing for plumbing parts, with a threaded connection to the pipework at the base. The top has a small outlet, usually hidden beneath a plastic dust cap. Internally there is a large hollow body, normally filled with water, and containing a float valve. The valve must always be installed vertically, usually at the top of a short vertical pipe. If the valve body is filled with water, the float moves upwards and closes the valve. If air collects in the valve body, the waterline lowers, as does the float, and the valve opens to release it. To give more sealing force on the valve, the float generally works the valve through a lever. A greater movement of the float gives a shorter, but more forceful, movement of the valve. This lever mechanism may be simply, almost crudely, made of a pressed steel strip which acts as a bending hinge. Larger valves are available for larger systems and these may be more sophisticated. They usually have a manual bleed valve or screw. They are also dismantlable for cleaning or repair. The float linkage may have multiple lever arms, in order to give greater mechanical advantage on the valve. A simpler valve appears similar to the venturi valve, but works by the float principle. These are simple poppet valves, operating by direct float action and sealing against the upper valve seat. = Radiator valves = Small automatic valves are available to fit individual radiators. As these need to operate in any orientation, they use a different mechanism rather than a float. The hygroscopic vent system uses hygroscopic cellulose fibre discs.https://www.caleffi.com/sites/default/files/file/01090.pdf These are small discs of material that expand when wet and shrink if warm and dry. A dry valve acts as an air vent until a dribble of water passes through it and swells the cartridge. If the valve dries out again, it re-opens. A characteristic of these valves is that they function best on the hot delivery side of a radiator and may not open as vents unless the water supply is hot. = Venturi valves = These operate by the varying viscosity of liquids and gases and are designed for situations, such as fire truck hoses, where there is a large flow and a large quantity of air to be vented rapidly. A conical plug valve is spring-loaded. Flow around this valve acts against spring pressure. Flow of liquid is sufficient to hold the valve against the spring, flow of air is not.

After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, from April 1943 to February 1946, he began playing professional baseball in 1946. He spent his first two campaigns in the Boston Red Sox system, batting .296 in 1946 and recording a 7‚Äì5 win‚Äìloss record in 114 inning pitcheds between the Milford Red Sox and Durham Bulls. He played briefly for the Oneonta Red Sox in 1947.

Discovered in 1938 and quickly developed afterward, the field peaked as an oil producer in the 1950s, but has remained active since its discovery. One of its depleted oil and gas producing formations, the Sesnon-Frew zone, was converted into a gas storage reservoir in 1973 by the Southern California Gas Company, the gas utility servicing the southern half of California. This reservoir is the second-largest natural gas storage site in the western United States, with a capacity of over 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Currently it is one of four gas storage facilities owned by Southern California Gas, the others being the La Goleta Gas Field west of Santa Barbara, Honor Rancho near Newhall, and Playa del Rey. Oil production on the field continues from 32 active wells as of 2016. The gas storage reservoir is accessed through 115 gas injection wells, along with approximately 38 miles of pipeline internal to the field. Three operators were active on the field: Southern California Gas Company, The Termo Company, and Crimson Resource Management Corp. Geographic setting The field is on the southern slope of the Santa Susana Mountains, an east-west trending range dividing the San Fernando Valley on the south from the Santa Clarita Valley on the north-northeast. With some of its productive wells set at an elevation over 3,000 feet, it is one of the highest and most rugged oil fields in California. The main entrance to the oil field is on Limekiln Canyon Trail where it intersects Sesnon Boulevard. Vehicles must pass a guard station and locked gate to enter. Land uses in the vicinity of the field include industrial (for the oil and gas field itself), open space, parkland, and residential to the south. Areas to the west, north, and east in the Santa Susana Mountains have been identified as Significant Ecological Areas. The Michael D. Antonovich Open Space Preserve abuts the field on the northeast, and numerous parks in Porter Ranch are adjacent on the south.Draft EIR, 4.10-3 Since the field is on the south slope of the Santa Susana Mountains, drainage is to the south into the San Fernando Valley, with runoff into Mormon Canyon, Limekiln Canyon, and Aliso Canyon, which all flow into the Los Angeles River, which then flows south through the Los Angeles Basin and out to the ocean at Long Beach. Vegetation on the field includes a mix of native habitat types, including oak woodlands and Venturan sage scrub, as well as non-native grassland, with many disturbed areas around roads and drilling and production pads. Climate in the area is Mediterranean, with warm, almost rainless summers, and mild and rainy winters. Snow is rare although it can fall at the higher elevations. Wildfires are common, particularly in the summer and fall, and some of the storage field was burned over in the October, 2008 14,000-acre Sesnon Fire.Draft EIR, 4.8-11 Geology The Aliso Canyon field consists of multiple layers of oil and gas bearing sediments in a southeast-plunging anticline bounded on the north by the Santa Susana Fault Zone and on the west- northwest by the Frew Fault. These tectonic features form a structural trap keeping oil in place. The layered Tertiary sedimentary zones within the anticline resemble a layer-cake elevated on the northwest, with some of the layers containing oil and gas, and other impermeable layers between them, keeping them separate. Older Cretaceous sedimentary rocks have been forced over the top by motion along the Frew Fault.Ingram, 67-69 The uppermost oil- bearing stratigraphic unit is the Pliocene-age Pico Formation, which contains the Aliso, Porter, and Upper, Middle, and Lower Del Aliso zones, from top to bottom, ranging in depth from about 4,500 to 8,000 feet. Underneath the Pico is the Middle Miocene Modelo Formation, and beneath that, bounded by an unconformity, the Eocene-age Llajas Formation. Since these units are both permeable and in direct contact, they form a single productive zone, the Sesnon-Frew, the largest of the field's zones and the one used by SoCalGas for gas storage. This unit has an average depth of about 9,000 feet, and averages about 160 feet thick.DOGGR, 25-26 Beneath the Sesnon-Frew are marine sediments of Cretaceous age, not known to contain oil, and below that crystalline basement rocks of Cretaceous age or older. History and production Detail of the Aliso Canyon field. Active oil wells are black dots; active gas injection wells are orange dots. The Santa Susana Mountains are one of several anticlinal formations within the Ventura Basin, and as such have long been of interest to those looking for oil.Draft EIR, 4.6-2 The oldest oil well in California, and the oldest commercially viable oil well in the western United States, was at the Pico Canyon Area of the Newhall Oil Field less than five miles northwest of the Aliso field boundary, also in the Santa Susana Mountains. J. Paul Getty's Tidewater Associated Oil Company drilled the discovery well for the Aliso field in 1938, finding oil in the Porter zone, 5,393 feet below ground surface. Other producing zones were discovered not long after, including Del Aliso zone in 1938, and the Sesnon-Frew zone in 1940. Several companies operated the field in the early years, including Tidewater, Standard Oil of California, Porter Sesnon et al., Porter Oil Co., Carlton Beal and Associates, and M.L. Orcutt.Ingram, 67; plate II (following page 73) By the middle of 1959, there were 118 producing wells on the entire field, and over 32 million barrels of oil had been withdrawn.Ingram, 73 Early in production, the Sesnon-Frew zone had been identified as having a strong gas cap, with some wells being completed in gas-only portions of the reservoir, needing to be deepenend. The overproduction of gas led to accusations of wasting, and litigation commenced with Standard Oil and Tidewater accusing Carlton Beal of wasting gas (lacking a modern pipeline transport system, natural gas at this time was not always retained for use ‚Äì it was commonly flared or just vented to the atmosphere). The State Oil and Gas Supervisor ruled in favor of Standard and Tidewater and limited production on the Sesnon pool to reduce the waste.Ingram, 67 One enhanced recovery technique, waterflooding, was used on the field, beginning in 1976. The Del Aliso zone was produced this way as conventional oil production began to decline. In this method, water pumped up with oil is disposed by being pumped back into the same formation from which it came, restoring reservoir pressure and pushing the remaining reservoir fluid to other recovery wells, even though it becomes more and more diluted with time. Suburban developments of the San Fernando Valley began approaching the field after it had already been fully developed, with some of the first residential housing in Porter Ranch appearing in the 1960s, but the main buildout started in the 1970s. Development continued into the first decade of the 21st century, expanding into the foothills right up to the SoCalGas property line. Many of these projects were master-planned developments, including gated communities, in one of San Fernando Valley's most affluent areas. Conversion to gas storage By the early 1970s the Sesnon zone was depleted of oil. As it was an enormous and structurally sound reservoir, with an average depth of about 9,000 feet, and centrally located in the distribution area of Pacific Lighting (an ancestor of Southern California Gas Company), it was ideal to use as a storage reservoir for gas for the local utility. Pacific Lighting bought rights to that portion of the field from Getty's Tidewater, and worked over the old oil production wells, many dating from 1940s and 1950s,Baker, PEB-3 to turn them into gas injection wells. The Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility, as this repurposed part of the oil field became known, became the largest gas storage reservoir owned by SoCalGas and the second largest in the western United States. Storage fields such as the four maintained by SoCalGas are necessary to balance the load between summer and winter months; gas can be withdrawn during the winter, when it is in high demand, and injected back into the reservoir during the warmer months. Aliso Canyon was ideally placed near the center of SoCalGas's service region, and connected to the system by an extensive pipeline network.Baker, PEB-2 In 2009 SoCalGas proposed an expansion and upgrade of the storage facility involving replacement of the obsolete gas turbine compressors with more up-to- date electric versions. This project would increase the gas injection capacity of the site from 300 million to 450 million cubic feet per day, and remove the compressors which were installed in 1971 when the storage facility was first being developed. It would also move guard houses and some other structures, build a substation on the field, and upgrade various transmission and telecommunications lines. After environmental review through draft and final Environmental Impact Reports as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the project was approved and construction began in 2014.Draft EIR, ES-1 - ES-3 Gas wells on the site are old, and have required considerable maintenance in recent years. Of 229 storage wells on the site, half were more than 57 years old as of July 2014.Baker, PEB-20 Casing, tubing, and wellhead leaks have occurred in recent years. For example, in 2013, two wells were found with casing leaks, four with tubing leaks, and two with leaks at the wellhead.Baker, PEB-19 In 2008, one well ‚Äì \\"Porter 50A\\" ‚Äì was found to have a gas pressure of 400 pounds per square inch on the surface annulus, an indication of a serious underground leak and potential safety hazard; this well was immediately removed from service, and on investigation corrosion was discovered along a 600-foot stretch of the production casing, ending more than 1000 feet below ground surface.Baker, PEB-18 SoCalGas designed a Storage Integrity Management Program to address these deficiences, along with a budget, and presented it to the State Public Utility Commission in 2014. Two other oil companies continue to operate on the field, outside of the SoCalGas facility boundary: The Termo Company and Crimson Resource Management Corp. These companies produce oil from other, shallower zones than the Sesnon-Frew zone that SoCalGas uses for gas storage. The Termo Company proposed an expansion of their operation, adding another 12 wells to the 15 they already had at the end of 2015, but put their plans on hold after the methane gas eruption from SoCalGas well Standard Sesnon 25 that began on October 23, 2015. 2015‚Äì2016 methane gas blowout A dramatic break somewhere along the length of an 8,750-foot injection well casing resulted in a gigantic methane eruption from the field on October 23, 2015, allowing the escape of around 60 million cubic feet of methane per day at first, before the pressure was reduced. The well, Standard Sesnon 25 (\\"SS 25\\") had originally been installed in 1953, and reworked as a gas injection well in 1973, but lacked a blowout prevention valve, as it had not been considered a priority given the well's position, at the time, far from a populated area. Fallout from the methane cloud, in the form of oily droplets and persistent noxious odors, caused the evacuation of over 6,000 families, who relocated to hotels and other rentals at SoCalGas's expense throughout the region. Another 10,000 homes received air-purification systems at the company's expense. On Dec. 4, 2015, SoCalGas commenced drilling a relief well to stop the natural gas blowout by plugging the damaged well at its base. The relief well intercepted the base of the well on Feb. 11, 2016, and the company began pumping heavy fluids to temporarily control the flow of gas out of the well. SoCalGas was able to plug the leak permanently on February 18, 2016. Overall the well is estimated to have released over 100,000 metric tons of natural gas, the largest such release in U.S. history.Conley et al., Methane emissions from the 2015 Aliso Canyon blowout in Los Angeles, CA. In: Science (2016), . In March 2016, Termo Company was fined $75,000 for piping in methane emissions from another natural gas leak in what the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources called \\"brazen and intentional violations of state law\\". Governor of California Jerry Brown issued an executive order banning natural gas injection until all of the wells were thoroughly tested for corrosion and leaks. On May 10 2016, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 380, introduced in the California State Senate by Fran Pavley, into law.

The work premiered on October 2, 1990 at New York City Center with costumes by Calvin Klein and lighting by David Finley. Chris Landriau arranged the music and played piano at the debut. The dance is a jubilant self-parody and an homage, of sorts, to Graham's mentor and musical director, Louis Horst, who would play the rag for her whenever she fell into a creative slump. Graham was 96 when she created Maple Leaf Rag; it is her last completed dance. In 1991, she began another work, The Eyes of the Goddess, but it was unfinished at the time of her death.  Synopsis  The curtain rises to reveal a grand piano at the rear of a darkened stage. The only other set element is a joggling board, a long springy plank set on two upright supports with rocker feet. Graham had discovered the rocking chair-bench hybrid when the Martha Graham Dance Company appeared at Spoleto USA in Charleston. The musician enters first and sits at the piano, repeatedly striking a foreboding chord. The dancers come in, initially a couple executing an overhead lift, then a circle of dancers, leaping and landing dramatically to the pounding of the piano. A female ensemble member breaks away from the group to perform a bouncing dance on the joggling board. The audience then hears Graham's recorded voice, \\"Oh Louis, play me the Maple Leaf Rag!\\" As Joplin's music starts, the stage lights come up. Six couples dance joyfully around the board on which the lone female now reclines. The pianist briefly interrupts the rag to reprise the ominous beat as a somber white-gowned, chignoned figure crosses the stage in a series of swirling turns. As she exits, the ensemble returns to joyous movement. The ballet is approximately 15 minutes in length. Three Scott Joplin rags provide the work's structure: Maple Leaf Rag (1899) opens the dance, followed by the waltz Bethena (1905) and Elite Syncopations (1902); a reprise of Maple Leaf Rag concludes the dance. The work is brimming with parodies of Graham's signature moves and send-ups of her best-known dances. Her twirling white-clad surrogate crosses the stage intermittently, accompanied each time by ill-boding percussive piano. Graham also pokes fun at the overwrought sexuality of some her repertory. Just before darkness hides the remaining couple on stage, he tears off her skirt.  Critical reception  Maple Leaf Rag was Graham's 180th choreographic work. Even so, reviewers noted, she still had the capacity to surprise and delight. \\"The new piece is an entertaining poke by a genius at her own cliches, tersely and wittily stated,\\" wrote The New York Times' Anna Kisselgoff. A critic seeing a much later performance said, \\"While she worked out her obsessions onstage, Graham also had a keen but oft-overlooked sense of humor. Set to several Scott Joplin rags that were still in vogue during her teenage years, Maple Leaf Rag is a sly and playful dance that effectively employs Graham's expressive vocabulary while winking at her own cliches.\\" Those most familiar with the troupe's repertory better understood the inside jokes. A takeoff on the \\"dart\\" step from Errand into the Maze was recognized by one reviewer. Another noticed Night Journey's \\"hiccupping\\" Furies. The dance critic for San Francisco Classical Voice identified \\"the dancers' foot-to-foot from Acrobats of God, the grabs and grimaces from Clytemnestra, the ecstatic clapping of the acolytes in Appalachian Spring, and...the exalted kick turns from the white- clad Graham solo Letter to the World, ending in a sobering yet giggle-worthy frozen pose.\\"  Performance history  An audience favorite since the first performance, Maple Leaf Rag is a staple of the Graham company repertoire. It is also included in Three Dances by Martha Graham, a TV program produced by WNET for PBS. Terese Capucilli appears as the Graham surrogate. Kathleen Turner provides the narration.

The prisoners, after being kidnapped and interrogated, would be forced to survive while living amongst the worst of conditions in a variety of different centers. Once the kidnapped were forced into detention centers, they immediately became the disappeared (Spanish: los desaparecidos). Although all camps had their \\"unique\\" ways of torturing, every detention center incorporated a torture room that each victim had to encounter. However, the torture did not end here. They were humiliated and dehumanized by the hands of the leaders, losing their ability to talk, shower, eat, and sleep. The Dirty War and select detention centers were notorious for mass murders to remove all evidence of the torture that had transpired. At the end of the Dirty War and a change in government, prisoners were released on the street blindfolded. The identity of the torturers in all of the detention centers was kept clandestinely at all times.  Detention Centers in Argentina  Argentina was said to have hosted over 520 clandestine detention centers during the Dirty War. No two detention centers were the same in torture methods, leadership, or location. However, they did represent a similar theme of the fear of political opposition, punishing the prisoners that were suspected to be involved in socialism or other forms of political dissent. Much of this information comes from primary sources that have since been transferred into writings of secondary source authors. Included below are detention centers that were located solely in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Because of the clandestine attitude surrounding the camps while running, little information is known about the true nature of these prisons. = 1. Escuela Superior de Mec√°nica de la Armada/Navy Petty- Officers School of Mechanics = La Escuela Superior de Mec√°nica de la Armada (ESMA) is, arguably, the most known detention center during the Dirty War. This detention center, located in the heart of Buenos Aires‚Äîapproximately two blocks from the 1978 World Cup Stadium‚Äîtortured around 5,000 people by the time it was shut down. By the time the Dirty War ended in 1983, only 150 of the victims survived. This particular torture center immediately split families upon their arrival, murdering the mothers as quickly as possible. From there, victims would travel to the basement that housed the majority of the torture to have their picture taken. Intense interrogations and torture plans made on an individual basis would ensue. Present day ESMA stands as a memorial for the human rights violations during this time. = 2. Club Atl√©tico = Acting as a location that promoted the torture of socialists against the Argentinian regime, Club Atl√©tico held as many as 1,500 \\"political dissenters\\" at one point, even though its maximum capacity hovered around 200 people. This center shared commonalities of ESMA, as it also promoted the use of its basement as a torture chamber. This is not surprising, as Club Atl√©tico was part of a largely connected link of clandestine operations that contributed to the detention, torture, and extermination of hundreds of people in this location alone. = 3. Olimpo = Similar to Club Atl√©tico, Olimpo was torturing more people than their facilities allowed. Located in Floresta, this place tortured around 500 people at its peak, ignoring the allowance of only 150 people in the building and utilizing the operation room as the torture site to mock the victims. This inhumane treatment that took place in the operation room highlighted the torturer's ruthlessness. Olimpo, specifically, has been known for its horrific interrogation methods of those accused of being associated with a rival political position. = 4. Virrey Cerallos = The theme for all of these detention centers are very similar in execution. However, the Virrey Cerallos, in the neighborhood of Monserrat, claimed its \\"fame\\" through its \\"efficient\\" torture methods in a garage of sorts. This more public showing of the clandestine actions occurring in Argentina during this time demonstrates how easy it was for Argentinian officials to violate human rights. = 5. Automotores Orletti = Orletti was also placed in the garage of a building. This torturing featured members of the military of both Argentina and Uruguay as a way to instill fear in the victims. This center, in particular, involved many nations that were also involved in Operation Condor as a whole. This implementation of fear, in principle, was to create an environment where the prisoner would have to admit to all political dissent he/she had committed. Because most of the victims were not actually members of the socialist party, they were either forced to falsely confess to their involvement in political opposition or take a chance with murder from the hands of the Argentinian government. = 6. Garaje Azopardo = Detention centers during the Dirty War have the reputation of torturing its victims. However, this garage of a torture center made its victims work and transmit passports illegally to friends of the Argentinian government. This addition of manual labor added a whole new layer to the dignity that these prisoners lost while trapped in this prisons. The Garaje has been accused of only giving victims one meal a day. With these conditions, it shows that each individual center had its \\"own unique trademark\\" that created new ways of violating human rights. Torture  Discussion of the plethora of detention centers in Argentina relates to the torture that each victim received while trapped in these prison-like conditions. Many victims, reporting years after surviving the awful treatment, tell a similar tale relating to the human rights violations that transpired because of the Argentinian leadership. Beginning as early as 1976, victims of the Dirty War were kidnapped from homes and public places and brought to detention centers like the ones discussed above, pending any suspicion of them being involved in political opposition to the Argentinian regime. Once these prisoners were brought to the respective camp, methods varied towards the type and severity of the torture. A New York Times article written on October 4, 1976 shares the experience of a victim who was blindfolded, hit, and forced to be nude. These conditions were only meant to scare the victims, in the hopes that they would share their secrets of socialism. A process of interrogation followed the \\"minor\\" torture methods in order to convince the prisoners to confess to the political dissent that they had committed. When these methods seemed insufficient to reveal the \\"hidden truths\\" of the prisoners, the leaders of the clandestine detention centers went one step further to offer more torture methods. Accounts of sexual abuse, cigarette burns, and electric shocks were common during this eight-year period of victimization. Methods, such as pushing prisoners off of planes into oceans, were also used to kill the victims. As more political opponents were captured and tortured, the idea of missing a loved one became more common. The Argentinian government contributed to the tortures themselves, so there were no governmental officials to oppose the human rights violations that were transpiring. Instead, most victims and their families were forced to remain quiet to stay alive. However, there was a movement of women called Las madres de la Plaza de Mayo that began in 1977, a year after the beginning of the Dirty War. These mothers marched along the Argentinian government, participating in non-violent protests to fight for the return of their children. Unlike the tangible torture that the kidnapped felt, the pain of the mothers in this movement was expressed through their actions. In many ways, this can be seen as a form of torture, the torture that las madres could not have their beloved children back in their lives. Some of the mothers would end up protesting for the rest of their lives, refusing to give up on the memory of the child. = United States involvement in Argentina = The United States, through its covert CIA and other intelligence agencies, has declassified certain documents that proves their knowledge of Operation Condor during the 1970s. Operation Condor is an umbrella operation of the CIA, in which six Latin American countries banded together to remove all potential political opponents in the Southern Cone. The Dirty War connects as a specific event to the larger Operation Condor. In a conversation between Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and many of his colleagues, one of them argues that the Argentinian junta was overdoing the control it had over its citizens. Kissinger simply remarks that the treatment and policy of detention centers is, in fact, good for United States interests while also stating that this junta will need \\"a little encouragement from [the United States]\\" to pursue its efforts. Most famously, Henry Kissinger is associated with a big personality and his commentary encouraging the Dirty War to advance in Argentina. Among many other quotes, this former Secretary of State spoke openly to the leaders of Operation Condor by supporting their efforts; he believed that \\"the quicker you succeed the better.\\" Kissinger shows the tolerance of the United States when it comes to the pain and torture of other people in other nations held both inside and outside of the detention centers. He also has been described as giving the \\"green light\\" to the nations that were causing pain for so many prisoners. This idea highlights his outspoken support of this event. Kissinger was the leader who spoke, but many of the leaders of America during this time had a similar train of thought. A majority of the American effort in Argentina dealt with the economy, largely ignoring the issues that were happening on ground level. Between the lack of jobs and abundant refugees flooding into Argentina, America believed its duty was to control and maintain the balance of the economy. There was little recognition of the treatment of Dirty War victims, as it was left to the side in order to deal with the \\"real, pressing issues\\" of the time in the opinion of the United States government. = United States inaction in Argentina = The opinions of Kissinger, supporting the continuation of Operation Condor policy and the restriction of human rights, were shared by other figures of power during this time as well. This contributes to why the United States remained silent when victims were being tortured by the thousands. Primary sources tell a story that proves America's knowledge and recognition of the severity of the events in Argentina during the Dirty War. The United States government published a list of American people who were either dead or disappeared in 1978 at the hands of the Dirty War in order to prove that the desaparecidos were being tortured both by domestic and abroad in detention centers. Following this release of information, no major American opposition movements followed this direct proof of people who had vanished from the world. A year later, the United States sent the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to travel to Argentina to see the impact of the abuses of human rights on the nation as a whole. By the time the Commission came by in 1979, the United States had decreed that terrorism was not an issue in this area of the world. The exchange of words did not help to create change in Argentina. Henry Kissinger consistently commented on the Dirty War without proactively fixing the situation. He was not the only one to disregard what was transpiring during Operation Condor. In a conversation between men who wrote for the United States Embassy in Argentina, they confirmed that 80-90% of the clandestine detention centers were destroyed by 1979, the year that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights traveled to Argentina. Two of the men remark that this progress was satisfactory due to the fact that the majority of the camps had been removed. Yet, the knowledge that most of the camps were no longer functioning raises the question of where the victims of these centers went. A large percentage of the victims that were once \\"housed\\" in the detention centers that were destroyed were confirmed to be disappeared, dead, or transferred to the small percentage of camps that were still running at the time.

Mostovoy was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his actions during the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive.  Early life  Mostovoy was born on 18 July 1908 on the Grinyov farm in Bogucharsky Uyezd of Voronezh Governorate to a Ukrainian peasant family. He graduated from elementary school and worked on the collective farm.  World War II  Mostovoy was drafted into the Red Army in June 1941. He fought on the Central Front in the western defensive battles. He then fought on the Bryansk Front with the 284th Rifle Division. Mostovoy was transferred to the Southwestern Front along with his division and fought in the Battle of Stalingrad. In February 1943, the division became the 79th Guards Rifle Division. Mostovskoy fought in the Barvenkovo-Lozovaya Operation. In September and October 1943, he fought in the Battle of the Dnieper.

The city hall was built in 1857 and was listed in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 18 March 1996. It is the second, and oldest preserved, city hall of Aarhus. The city Hall is situated next to Aarhus Cathedral on the corner of Domkirkepladsen and Mejlgade in the central Indre By neighbourhood and has functioned as city hall, police station and today as a museum, housing both the Women's Museum and the Occupation Museum.  History  The city hall was built between 1856 and 1857 to a design by architect and royal building inspector C.G.F. Thielemann as a replacement for the former city hall which has been located opposite the cathedral. The building was designed to be a combined city hall, police station and jail. The main entrance led to the city hall and an entrance on the west side gave access to the police station while the jail was placed in a smaller building in a court yard behind the city hall. The mayor's office and council hall was placed on the first floor. In 1906, a new jail and council building was built and the jail building behind the city hall was substantially changed to make room for offices. The interior of the city hall was renovated and the main entrance was enhanced with a large arch. The rapid growth of the city in the early 20th century meant the administrative needs quickly outgrew the city hall and offices spread to other nearby buildings. In the 1930s it was again decided to build a new city hall which became the current city hall on Park All√©, complete in 1941. When the city administration finally moved, the old city hall became the city's police from 1941 to 1984, when a new police station was built. In 1949 the third- floor attic was taken into use as a storage space and small exhibition hall for a collection of Etruscan rarities collected by a professor from the University of Aarhus. In 1971 this collection was moved and became the Museum of Ancient Art. Since 1995 the building has housed the Women's Museum and the Occupation Museum. During the renovation in the 1990s a garden was established by the entrance, named for the women's rights activist Matilde Fibiger.  Architecture  The rear of the building The building is an example of Renaissance Revival architecture and was designed by C.G.F. Thieleman. Inspired by the psychiatric hospital Jydske Asyl in Risskov by Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll, it reflects Thieleman's interest in Empire style and Neoclassical architecture. The interior was redesigned by S.F. K√ºhnel in 1907 and features prominent national romantic elements in the foyer and council chambers. The building is built of red brick with horizontal bands of cement and granite ashlar in the corners. The main entrance is set under a large archway and the windows are decorated with pilastres. The structure rests on a base of granite ashlar with decorative bands above the basement windows. The ridged roof is covered in winged brick tile, broken only by two small dormer windows. The foyer features large granite columns under a painted strip waffle slab ceiling. The solid granite staircase is surmounted by two large glass ceiling mosaics.

The whole family assembles, and Anita brings her little daughter Rosita, Annemarie's first great- grandchild, to the celebration. In 1928, Ury revised and adapted a chapter (\\"The Radio\\") to reflect the modern technology. Genre Else Ury, 1915 The Nesth√§kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12 ‚Äì 16 years old. A Backfisch (‚Äúteenage girl‚Äù, literally ‚Äúfish for frying‚Äù) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesth√§kchen series with volume 6, Nesth√§kchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesth√§kchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesth√§kchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesth√§kchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesth√§kchen and Her Chicks. Author Else Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin; January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best-known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesth√§kchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesth√§kchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

The Chalice of Crossdrum is a lost Roman Catholic liturgical vessel. Physical description The chalice itself is described as, History The Chalice of Crossdrum was found in 1750 in Crossdrum, near Oldcastle, County Meath, Ireland. The chalice was found in a cave, beside a priest's skeleton, along with other liturgical items, including a chasuble, an altar-stone, a crucifix, and candlesticks. Given its location, scene of discovery, and relative dates of the artifacts, scholars generally concur that the discovered priest was likely a Jesuit who covertly provided the sacraments to local Catholics during the Cromwellian period, when such activities were proscribed by the state. The man who made the discovery, Hugh Reilly, handed the discovery over to his brother, the Rev. Bartholomew Reilly, a parish priest in Co. Meath. The priest's skeleton was sacramentally buried, and the location of the other discovered items remains unknown. The chalice and paten were subsequently passed from Rev. Bartholomew Reilly to Fr. Owen Reilly, the former's uncle, on the event of his death in 1782. Fr. Owen Reilly died in 1784. Debate surrounds the location of the chalice after Fr. Owen Reilly's ownership. The chalice resurfaced in 1832, under the possession of Rev. George McDermot, parish priest of Oldcastle. The chalice was kept in the parish, coming under the ownership of Father George Leonard, the successor parish priest. It was at this time that the chalice took on a mythical element, supposedly granting the keeper longevity of live. Fr. Leonard died in 1877, at the age of 85. The chalice then passed to Leonard's nephew, Fr. Thomas Fagan, parish priest of Rathconnell, County Westmeath. Fr. Fagan died in 1886, and the chalice passed to Fr. Fagan's nephew, the Very Rev. Thomas Gaffney in Rutland, Vermont. Gaffney picked up the chalice in Ireland, after a conflict of ownership that required local diocesan intervention. Since his acquisition of the chalice, Fr. Gaffney used the vessel in every celebration of the Feast of St Patrick, until his death in 1906. Ff. Gaffney, in his will, left the chalice in the hands of Fr. James A. Taaffe, S.J., of Fordham University in New York. Since Fr. Taaffe's ownership, the location of the chalice remains unconfirmed, some speculating it remains in the hands of the aforementioned Jesuit university, among Taaffe's descendants in Long Island, or elsewhere.

Sisal was continually produced during the German administration and the British administration and was the colony's largest export highly prized for use in cordage and carpets worldwide. At the time of independence in 1961, Tanzania was the largest exporter of Sisal in the world and the industry employed over 1 million farmers and factory workers. Sisal production began to decline after independence due to the drop in world prices as synthetic nylon substitutes became more popular. The nationalization of the estates during Ujamaa and the mismanagement of the estates further dropped the production in the country. However, in recent years the government has injected funds to help revive the industry's glory.  History  Sisal Plantation in German East Africa 1906 Sisal laid out to dry in British Tanganyika Sisal is the oldest commercial cash crop still in survival in Tanzania. In 1893 visionary German Agronomist Dr. Richard Hindorf introduced the crop into the colony. The plant Agave sisalana was smuggled into Tanganyika from Yucat√°n, Mexico in the belly of a stuffed crocodile. Only 66 plants had survived the journey but it was commercially viable to start the industry. The country's warm and semi arid climate was perfect for the plant and production in the colony grew exponentially. The plants fibers were mainly used for the production of ropes for the German naval fleet and sacks to export other agriculture products from the colony. This success story began to grab the attention of the other European powers expanding their navies and the industry expanded to the neighboring colonies of modern-day Kenya, Mozambique and Angola. Post World War I the British scored control of Tanganyika and continued to develop the industry. The colonial government continued to allocate more land for Sisal production which attracted Ex-British officers living in Kenya and many German settlers to continue farming along the country's northern border along the Arusha-Tanga road. At independence in 1961, Tanganyika was the world leader in Sisal production and over 200,000 tonnes of sisal was produced annual employing over 1 million workers in the industry. The crop was the country's highest foreign exchange earner and was referred to as Tanzania's 'green gold'. Sisal production in the country peaked in 1964 with around 250,000 tonnes in production from regions from all over the country such as Tanga, Morogoro, Arusha, Mwanza and Shinyanga. In 1967 following the Arusha Declaration most of the sisal estates were nationalized by the government. This began the downfall of the sisal industry as bureaucracy, over- centralization and lack of experience caused the production to fall rapidly. Furthermore, with the increasing popularity of Synthetic Nylon fibers, drove the world price for sisal down resulting in the foreclosure of many sisal factories. By the end of Ujamaa and President Nyerere's rule, sisal production had fallen from 235,000 tonnes in 1964 to 32,000 in 1985, less than 15% of the country's peak. With the changing economic landscape in Tanzania, the government of Tanzania passed the Sisal Industry Act, 1997; which allowed privatization of the government owned factories and established the Tanzania Sisal Board. Sisal production since has been stable, however there are no recent breakthroughs in production. Tanzania currently sits as the second largest producer of Sisal in the world after Brazil and the government plans to revive the industry to help facilitate the nations former glory.  Sisal products  African sisal bag The Sisal plant is used to produce a sisal line fiber. Historically this fiber has been used to produce threads and ropes for ships. Domestically the fibers are used to make various consumer handicraft products such as; #Carpets #Bags #Sacks #Low density cords. =Energy production= With the production of sisal only 2-5% of the plant is utilized. The remaining bio material is used as fertilizer or thrown away. In Tanzania, the Katani Limited constructed the country's first Sisal waste bio gas power plant at Hale. The project helps provide energy for rural establishments and the government plans to encourage the practice to help increase the country's energy output and reduce foreign exchange losses from the purchase of fossil fuels. Currently, the plant produces 1 MW of electricity and organic fertilizers which help reduce the company's costs. The Katani limited plans to build 5 more of the plants in a joint venture with a Chinese company at their various estates.  Notable companies  Sisal Plantations in Mt.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Portugal and Spain in Europe. It has evergreen broad leaves, forming dense clumps, it has dwarf stems in late spring, (between April and May), with 1 upright fragrant flower, in shades of purple, light red purple, grey-blue, blue-violet, or dark violet. It has a beard which is generally blue, purple, or violet, but can fade to white, dull yellow, or dark yellow. After being found in 1804, it was once a separate species until the late 70s, when it was reclassified as subspecies of Iris lutescens, and renamed Iris lutescens subsp. subbiflora. But in the 80s it was returned to an independent species but some authors and references still class the species as a synonym or subspecies. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is similar in form as Iris germanica, but with smaller growth. It has a small rhizome, which is thick and has several branches. The rhizome is smaller than other bearded irises, apart from Iris pumila. When the rhizome is cut, (for propagation purposes) it produces a nice aroma. It has semi-deciduous, or evergreen,Kelly Norris broad leaves, that can grow up to between long, and between 0.5 and 2.5 cm wide. The ensiform (sword-shaped) leaves, form dense clumps, which are often taller than the stem. It has a simple, dwarf stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. It sometimes produces 2 stems and the lowest portion of the stem is covered by 2 short stem leaves. It has 1 acuminate (pointed), spathe (leaf of the flower bud), which is green but often stained purple, with a (scarious) membranous top portion. It can be up to long and is similar in form to Iris griffithii. It has a perianth tube, that is long, green and marked purple. The stems hold 1 terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming in mid- to late spring, or summer,James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) between April, and May,(by) a Lady William Aiton or June. It can sometimes also produce another flower in the fall (autumn). The fragrant flower, is in diameter, it comes in various shades, of purple, light red purple, grey-blue, blue-violet, or dark violet. It is thought to be one of the darkest flowered species known. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate (with a narrower end at the base), with a narrow haft (portion of the petal near the stem), they are long and wide. They are wider than the standards. They can sometimes have brown purple veining on the haft. In the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is generally blue, purple, or violet, but can fade to white, or dull yellow, or dark yellow on the haft. The standards are also obovate, but often retuse (rounded), they are also paler than the falls, but have red-brown veining on the hafts. It has long, style branches that are colourless with a violet keel, they also have a semi-ovate crests. It also has blue filaments, which are long and bluish or white anthers, that are long. It has a long perianth tube. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, in mid June, inside the capsule are brown, wrinkled, pyriform (pear shaped) to oval shaped seeds, which are later dispersed by animals or the wind. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It was counted in 1955 as Iris lutescens subsp. subbiflora (Brot.) D. A. Webb & Chater in Flora Iberica (Chromosome atlas of flowering plants). Darlintong, C. D. & A. P. Wylie.(1955) and Iris lutescens subsp. subbiflora (Brot.) D. A. Webb & Chater in Flora Iberica (Contribucin al estudio cariologico de la familia Iridaceae en Andalucia Occidental.) Prez, E. & J. Pastor and Lagascalia Vol.17 (Issue 2) on pages 257‚Äì272 in 1994. It has been counted as 2n=40. Taxonomy Seen in Sierra Blanquilla, M√°laga in Spain It is commonly known as 'Portugal iris', or 'purple iris'. It is known in Portugal as 'L√≠rio-roxo-dos-montes', or 'l√≠rio- roxo', meaning purple lily, or 'Red Iris'. The Latin specific epithet subbiflora refers to 'subbiflorus' mostly two-flowered.D. Gledhill This is because the plant occasionally, produces two flowers instead of the usual single flower. Although Subbifera would have been a seems to be a more appropriate specific name, as it sometimes produces flowering stems as different seasons (such as in spring and autumn). Carolus Clusius originally named the plant Iris biflora, not Iris bisflorens because he found it in flower in November near Coimbra (in Portugal). It was first published and described by F√©lix Avelar Brotero in Flora Lusitanica (Fl. Lusit.) Vol.1 on page 50, table 96 in 1804. Fl. lusit. 1:50, t. 96. 1804 It was also published with an illustration in the Botanical magazine 1130 of 1808. In 1812, Richard Anthony Salisbury published the iris as Iris fragrans Salisb. in Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London Vol.1 page 303. But this name is illegal by most authors due to plagiarism accusations about Salisbury. In 1840, it was thought to be an Italian variety of Iris germanica, although it if very different in form to the 'Lisbon Iris'.John Lindley (Editor) It was also published as Iris subbiflora in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1854, then published in 14 July 1894, and in Vol.47 on page 146 in 5 March 1910. It is closely related to Iris lutescens. In 1978, D.A.Webb & Chater reclassified the iris as a subspecies of Iris lutescens, and published it in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. (Bot. J. Linn. Soc.) Vol.76, Issue 4, on page 316, as Iris lutescens Lamark subsp subbiflora (Brotero) Webb and Chater, and then in Vol.5 of Flora Europaea. In 1988, a study of Iris lutescens Lam. subsp. lutescens from Italy and France with Iris lutescens subsp. subbiflora (Brot.) DA Webb & Chater from Portugal. It concluded it thought that Iris subbiflora Brot was an independent species, which has been agreed by other authors. Although, it is still listed as Iris lutescens subsp. subbiflora in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life with Iris subbiflora Brot. as a synonym. It was last listed in the RHS Plant Finder in 2014, as Iris lutescens subsp. subbiflora. It is verified as Iris subbiflora by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, and then altered on 3 December 2004 Distribution and habitat It is native to south west Europe, and north Africa. =Range= It is found in the Iberian Peninsula, within Portugal, and Spain, (including in western Andalusia, near Antequera, and near Lisbon.) It is also found in North Africa, within Morocco and Tunisia. =Habitat= It grows on limestone, or chalky, rocky hills, and in scrub land. Conservation It is considered a rare plant, but is unassessed for IUCN Red List. Cultivation It is hardy, to European Zone H2, meaning it is hardy from ‚àí15, to ‚àí20 ¬∞C (5 to ‚àí4 ¬∞F). It is also hardy to USDA Zone 6, and needs a dry spring. It was thought that the species would not like the damp climates of Britain, and needs hot summers, to help create flowers, but Brian Mathew found it quite hardy. It therefore must vary in hardiness, less hardy forms could be grown in a cold frame. It prefers to grow in well drained, sandy, or rocky, and limy soils. It also prefers positions in full sun. It needs a hot baking summer sun on the rhizomes to help form flowers. It can be grown in rock gardens. It was introduced to Britain in 1596, and cultivated by Mr John Gerard. Sir Thomas Gage, had a specimen of the species stored within his herbarium. It is at risk from slugs and snails, from damage to the leaves and young shoots. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. =Hybrids and cultivars= It has been used in hybridization programmes, to add more heat hardiness to dwarf and medium-sized bearded irises. There are numerous variants of the iris species. One variant known as Iris subbiflora var. lisbonensis (Dykes), later classified as a synonym, it has green spathes (without purple markings), and a longer perianth tube. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske ReferencesSources * Dykes The Genus Iris, 1913, plate33. * Fennane, M. & M. I. Tattou 1998.

Located on Church Street in Hamilton, construction began in 1852 and opened its doors in 1861. The hotel was instrumental in starting tourism in Bermuda. It was destroyed by fire in 1955. History Construction was funded by the Corporation of Hamilton. The foundation stone of this building was laid by the Governor of Bermuda, Capt. Charles Elliot, B.N., on August 19, 1852, during the term of Mayor Henry James Tucker. Elliot was assisted in the ceremony by the members of the Masonic lodges, and by the heads of the various Public Departments, Imperial and Colonial. Completed in the following year, it originally had 36 rooms. On January 27, 1863, a subscription ball was held there, the string band of the Flagship H.M.S. Nile furnishing the music. April 21, 1863 a public dinner was given as a sort of opening of the Hamilton Hotel. D. A. Crowell (died August, 1888, Sohooley's Mountains, New Jersey) conducted the hotel for a short space. The American Civil War exerted a depressing influence on the fortunes of the hotel. When regular steam communication with New York City was assured, the late Jeremiah Harnett took a lease from the Corporation and associated with himself the late Mr. Dodge. The lease then entered on formed the groundwork one between Walter Aiken and the Corporation of Hamilton. James Russell Mead assumed control for the season of 1894. The hotel was destroyed by fire December 23, 1955. Architecture and fittings Hamilton Hotel, Bermuda The original design comprized a centre with two lateral wings and dining hall and kitchen in rear, the building being shaped as a capital The first addition made was a west wing, then extension of the dining room. The additions and alterations began in 1884 and completed 1886 altered entirely the whole aspect of the house and converted it into a hotel of large proportions. The old construction was carefully examined and wherever requisite either renewed or strengthened. Ia addition to the ordinary plastering, the whole building was painted externally. New and extensive tanks were provided added. In 1888, a well was bored and successfully completed, still further improving them. In 1890, a steam passenger elevator was provided and more tankage constructed, and an ice-making machine introduced. In 1891, ten more bedrooms were added in the attic extended over the west wing instead of the flat Bermudian stone roof. In 1892, the office and waiting-room were enlarged under a better arrangement. In 1909, it was enlarged and improved. There were then 260 rooms with baths, enough accommodation for 500 persons. It was substantial stone and concrete structure, lit with electricity and gas, and containing three elevators. There were 200 baths en-suite and numerous public baths on each floor. The hotel was heated by steam, and had open fires for cool days. The public rooms were large and comfortable, and an orchestra was provided. Grounds Situated on high ground overlooking the town and harbor of Hamilton, it afforded good views, and was convenient to shops, churches, Government buildings, parade grounds and the golf and cricket fields. The grounds were laid out in terraces containing flowers and various shrubs, while the drive up and the steps for pedestrians were improved. To the northwest, adjoining the hotel in 1886, a new building called The Annex was erected, which afforded privacy to those staying there.

It operates on the principle of solid- state diffusion, wherein the atoms of two solid, metallic surfaces intersperse themselves over time. This is typically accomplished at an elevated temperature, approximately 50-75% of the absolute melting temperature of the materials. Diffusion bonding is usually implemented by applying high pressure, in conjunction with necessarily high temperature, to the materials to be welded; the technique is most commonly used to weld \\"sandwiches\\" of alternating layers of thin metal foil, and metal wires or filaments. Currently, the diffusion bonding method is widely used in the joining of high- strength and refractory metals within the aerospace and nuclear industries.  History  The act of diffusion welding is centuries old. This can be found in the form of \\"gold-filled,\\" a technique used to bond gold and copper for use in jewelry and other applications. In order to create filled gold, smiths would begin by hammering out an amount of solid gold into a thin sheet of gold foil. This film was then placed on top of a copper substrate and weighted down. Finally, using a process known as \\"hot-pressure welding\\" or HPW, the weight/copper/gold-film assembly was placed inside an oven and heated until the gold film was sufficiently bonded to the copper substrate. Modern methods were described by the Soviet scientist N.F. Kazakov in 1953.  Characteristics  Diffusion bonding involves no liquid fusion, and often no filler metal. No weight is added to the total, and the join tends to exhibit both the strength and temperature resistance of the base metal(s). The materials endure no, or very little, plastic deformation. Very little residual stress is introduced, and there is no contamination from the bonding process. It may be performed on a join surface of theoretically any size with no increase in processing time; practically speaking, the surface tends to be limited by the pressure required and physical limitations. It may be performed with similar and dissimilar metals, reactive and refractory metals, or pieces of varying thicknesses. Diffusion bonding is most often used for jobs either difficult or impossible to weld by other means, due to its relatively high cost. Examples include welding materials normally impossible to join via liquid fusion, such as zirconium and beryllium; materials with very high melting points such as tungsten; alternating layers of different metals which must retain strength at high temperatures; and very thin, honeycombed metal foil structures. Titanium alloys will often be diffusion bonded despite as the thin oxide layer can be dissolved and diffused away from the bonding surfaces at temperatures over 850 degrees C.  Temperature Dependence  Steady state diffusion is determined by the amount of diffusion flux that passes through the cross-sectional area of the mating surfaces. Fick's first law of diffusion states: :J = -D(dC/dx), where J is the diffusion flux, D is a diffusion coefficient, and dC/dx is the concentration gradient through the materials in question. The negative sign is a product of the gradient. Another form of Fick's law states: :J = M/(At), where M is defined as either the mass or amount of atoms being diffused, A is the cross-sectional area, and t is the time required. Equating the two equations and rearranging, we achieve the following result: :t = -(1/D)(M/A)(dC/dx)^{-1}. As mass and area are constant for a given joint, time required is largely dependent on the concentration gradient, which changes by only incremental amounts through the joint, and the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient is determined by the equation: :D = D_0 e^{-Q_\\\\text{d}/RT}, where Qd is the activation energy for diffusion, R is the universal gas constant, T is the thermodynamic temperature experienced during the process, and D0 is a temperature-independent preexponential factor that depends on the materials being joined. For a given joint, the only term in this equation within control is temperature.  Processes  Animation of Diffusion Bonding Process When joining two materials of similar crystalline structure, diffusion bonding is performed by clamping the two pieces to be welded with their surfaces abutting each other. Prior to welding, these surfaces must be machined to as smooth a finish as economically viable, and kept as free from chemical contaminants or other detritus as possible. Any intervening material between the two metallic surfaces may prevent adequate diffusion of material. Specific tooling is made for each welding application to mate the welder to the workpieces.http://www.welding- advisers.com/Diffusion-welding.html Once clamped, pressure and heat are applied to the components, usually for many hours. The surfaces are heated either in a furnace, or via electrical resistance. Pressure can be applied using a hydraulic press at temperature; this method allows for exact measurements of load on the parts. In cases where the parts must have no temperature gradient, differential thermal expansion can be used to apply load. By fixturing parts using a low-expansion metal (i.e. molybdenum) the parts will supply their own load by expanding more than the fixture metal at temperature. Alternative methods for applying pressure include the use of dead weights, differential gas pressure between the two surfaces, and high-pressure autoclaves. Diffusion bonding must be done in a vacuum or inert gas environment when using metals that have strong oxide layers (i.e. copper). Surface treatment including polishing, etching, and cleaning as well as diffusion pressure and temperature are important factors regarding the process of diffusion bounding. At the microscopic level, diffusion bonding occurs in three simplified stages: * Microasperity deformation- before the surfaces completely contact, asperities (very small surface defects) on the two surfaces contact and plastically deform. As these asperities deform, they interlink, forming interfaces between the two surfaces. * Diffusion-controlled mass transport- elevated temperature and pressure causes accelerated creep in the materials; grain boundaries and raw material migrate and gaps between the two surfaces are reduced to isolated pores. * Interface migration- material begins to diffuse across the boundary of the abutting surfaces, blending this material boundary and creating a bond.  Benefits  * The bonded surface has the same physical and mechanical properties as the base material. Once bonding is complete, the joint may be tested using tensile testing for example. * The diffusion bonding process is able to produce high quality joints where no discontinuity or porosity exists in the interface. In other words, we are able to sand, manufacturing and heat the material. * Diffusion bonding enables the manufacture of high precision components with complex shapes. Also, diffusion is flexible. * The diffusion bonding method can be used widely, joining either similar or dissimilar materials, and is also important in processing composite materials. * The process is not extremely hard to approach and the cost to perform the diffusion bonding is not high. * The material under diffusion is able to reduce the plastic deformation.  Applicability  Animation of sheet forming process using diffusion welding Diffusion bonding is primarily used to create intricate forms for the electronics, aerospace, and nuclear industries. Since this form of bonding takes a considerable amount of time compared to other joining techniques such as explosion welding, parts are made in small quantities, and often fabrication is mostly automated. However, due to different requirements, the required time could be reduced. In an attempt to reduce fastener count, labor costs, and part count, diffusion bonding, in conjunction with superplastic forming, is also used when creating complex sheet metal forms. Multiple sheets are stacked atop one another and bonded in specific sections. The stack is then placed into a mold and gas pressure expands the sheets to fill the mold. This is often done using titanium or aluminum alloys for parts needed in the aerospace industry. Typical materials that are welded include titanium, beryllium, and zirconium. In many military aircraft diffusion bonding will help to allow for the conservation of expensive strategic materials and the reduction of manufacturing costs. Some aircraft have over 100 diffusion-bonded parts, including; fuselages, outboard and inboard actuator fittings, landing gear trunnions, and nacelle frames.

She wonders how Fred got under her coals and offers the dirty and battered man her help. In the meantime, Charlotte Wischnewski receives news of her husband's accident. However, since the accident victim himself has disappeared, Charlotte complains to the hired killer and unceremoniously kills him with a poisoned arrow. She finds a new ally in her colleague Frosch and assigns him to look for Fred, because she wants to be sure that he is really dead and that she has the company to herself. Fred stays in contact with the hereafter, from which he receives support. His mother visits him after a reincarnation in the form of a turkey, which he finds in Rita's refrigerator. When Rita experiences her Sunday roast talking to Fred, she briefly faints him. But she too has a secret, because she is a militant animal rights activist and, among other things, frees rabbits from test laboratories. So she offers Fred and his mother to live in her house for the near future. When he stands up for Rita's rescued animals, she also wants to help him with his tasks in return. First, Fred wants to take care of his sixteen-year-old daughter Lisa, whom he had completely neglected in recent years and who has gotten into the clutches of pimps. Because Fred cannot die, he survives their attacks and, with Rita's help, can save the girl and see to it that the pimps are arrested. With that he has completed his first task and turns to the second: Lisa's mother. She threw herself out of the window twelve years ago out of lovesickness and since then her soul has found no rest. He succeeds in persuading Barbara to leave earth for good. Charlotte is still looking for Fred and hopes to finally find his body. He again suspects that his wife is the third person he is supposed to help her happiness. Therefore, he wants to make up with her, although he slowly realizes that he has fallen in love with Rita. When Charlotte accidentally hits herself with one of her poison arrows and dies, Fred fears that he will not be able to complete his last task. In his desperation, he argues massively with Rita, who then wants to take her own life. At the last second he snatches the syringe she wants to use to kill herself. He has thus unplanned the third task to get his life back, and ultimately finds his true love in Rita.  Cast  * Christoph M.

It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Golden Mountains of Altai\\", recognized as an area of high biodiversity and isolation from human intrusion. It is also included in the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The Altai Reserve includes the 30 km-long east bank of Lake Teletskoye and stretches 230 km into the high mountains to the southeast of the lake. It is situated in Ulagansky District and Turochaksky District in the north and east of the Altai Republic. Topography The reserve has an elongated shape running from the northeast to southwest along the Teletskoye basin and into the high interior. Elevations rise to . This territory average 35 km wide through its 230 km length. Lake Teletskoye is in the upper northwest end. The Chulyshman River runs into the lake, with the Chulyshman valley forming part of the western border of the Altia Reserve. Most of the reserve is the plains and alpine ridges of the Chulyshman Highlands. Over 20% of the territory is rock, scree and gravel. On the high plateaus there are over 1,000 alpine lakes greater than 1 hectare in size. Location of Altai Zapovednik (in green) in the northeast of the Altai Republic Great Falls of the Chuchinsky River, one of the six areas of the Altai Reserve open to tourists Climate and ecoregion Altai is located in the Sayan montane conifer forests ecoregion. This ecoregion is characterized by mountains dissected by river valleys, high levels of precipitation, and high biodiversity. Flora is generally dependent on the elevation and terrain, with forest having three main subzones based on altitude: light needle-leaf sparse taiga, dark needle-leaf taiga, and dark taiga. The Altai reserve has been for the most part undisturbed by human activity, and is one of the few remaining pristine areas of this ecoregion. It covers 9.4% of the entire Republic of Altai, and there are no roads in the reserve. The climate of Altai is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate(Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). Over the past 50 years in the Altai reserve, the warmest month has been July (+16,8 ¬∞C), the coldest month (January -8,3 ¬∞C), and the average rainfall has been 865 mm. Flora and fauna The most common trees in the Altai Reserve coniferous species: larch, Siberian, Siberian cedar and Siberian fir. On the slopes near Lake Teletskoye there are some secondary forests of birch and alder, but most of the reserve to the south is untouched - cedars on the site have been measured up to 1.8 meters in diameter and 400‚Äì450 years in age. Scientists at the reserves have recorded over 1,500 species of vascular plants, including 22 species listed as 'vulnerable' in the Red Book of the Russian Federation. There are over 70 species of mammals in the reserve, including two endangered species, the Snow Leopard and the Altai argali. There are 19 species of fish, mostly in Lake Teletskoye, including pike, perch, and whitefish. In the streams the most common fish is the grayling. Of the 331 species of birds found in the reserve, most (48%) are passerine (159 species), waders (48 species), Falconiformes (30 species), and geese (29 species). The remaining 66 species account for only 20%. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Altai Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with \\"environmental education\\" purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are six \\"ecotourist\\" routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public, but require permits to be obtained in advance. Park management recommends allowing 2‚Äì3 months in advance for obtaining permits. The main office is in the city of Gorno-Altaysk.

In appearance, features, and pricing, the introduction of the Futura marked a new direction in the production of Royal portable typewriters. Sales were supported by an aggressive print advertising campaign directed at students, and the Futura itself was heavily discounted towards the end of its run. The radical new design eventually found its way onto other Royal models throughout the early and mid-1960s, and the name \\"Futura\\" would appear on another model later in decade. The typewriter was manufactured in both the United States and Canada. Design notes The Royal Futura was designed by Laird Fortune Covey. A design patent was applied for in 1957 and granted in 1958. The design differs from previous Royal portable typewriters in several ways. The most obvious difference is its curved and aerodynamic shape, but there were also key construction and materials differences. The Futura had aluminum body panels; this reduced the carrying weight to 22 pounds\\"From Royal A New Kind of Portable ‚Äì Futura 600\\" Magazine Advertisement from 1961. and provided limited rust protection. In addition to the aluminum body panels, the Futura had a corrugated steel front panel and welded steel internals and frame. The keys were plastic and designed in the recently adopted ‚ÄúTombstone‚Äù style. Two red ‚ÄúMagic Margin‚Äù buttons were located on top of the carriage and ‚Äì on some models ‚Äì 'tab set' and 'tab clear' keys could be found on the front panel. A plastic red 'Royal' logo also on the front panel doubled as the push-button latch control to open the top of the machine and allow access to the ribbon and internal controls. The Futura had four rubber feet to hold the typewriter in place, an acrylic paper table, and a steel carriage return lever. The standard typeface on all Royal Futura models was \\"Merit\\".\\"From Royal A New Kind of Portable ‚Äì Futura 800\\" magazine advertisement from 1958 to 1962. This typeface was available in Pica (10 characters per inch) and Elite (12 characters per inch). Keyboards were offered in English and French character sets. Other important design features included a 'Carriage Lock Lever' to protect the typewriter during travel by centering and immobilizing the carriage; a 'Ribbon Color Selector' that could be switched from black ribbon to red ribbon to stencil; 'Segment Shift', which allowed for the character basket rather than the carriage to move when the shift key was pressed; and a 'Clear Writing Line' that permitted an unobstructed character view while typing. Variations Although most Royal Futura advertising focused on the high-end model ‚Äì the Futura 800 ‚Äì there were two other models available. The Futura 400 and 600 were variations that differed in both appearance and functionality: =Futura 800= The Royal Futura 800 was the most popular, most feature-full, and most expensive model. It had a 44-key (48 character) keyboard. At the time, this was considered to be a full-keyboard and was more likely to be found on large office typewriters than on portable ones. The 800 also came equipped with a plastic, custom- fitted dust cover and internal felt lining to mute typing noise. Behind the paper table was a retractable V-shaped paper guide that allowed for easy viewing of work in progress. The 800 came in several different two-tone colors: \\"Periwinkle Blue\\", \\"Meadow Green\\", \\"Mist Gray\\", and \\"Cocoa\\" (often referred to as Salmon-Pink). A three-tone ‚ÄúAmericana‚Äù model with red, white, and blue body panels was also offered. =Futura 600= The Futura 600 differed from the 800 in several key respects. Most notably, the keyboard had 42 keys (44 characters). This was the more common portable typewriter keyboard configuration and did not include the following characters: \\"1\\", \\"!\\", \\"=\\", and \\"+\\". The 600 lacked a retractable paper guide and was available in two monotone colors: Imperial Pearl Gray and Blue. Finally, the Futura 600 came equipped with a different luggage case than the 800 did and did not have its own dust cover. =Futura 400= Like the 600, the Futura 400 had a 42-key keyboard. Unlike the 600, there was no ‚ÄúMagic Column Set‚Äù and therefore, no way to set automatic tabs. The Futura 400 came in a single monotone color: Mist Gray. Luggage case All new Royal Futura models came standard with a luggage case. The Futura 800 case was bound in faux leather and included a Royal-branded luggage tag. The luggage case included with the 400 and 600 models was fiberglass and designed to look like a small tweed suitcase. All Futura cases were durable and included internal latches for securing the typewriter while in transit, and an external lock to prevent unauthorized access. The Futura 800 cases originally came with a leather handle while the 400 and 600 handles were made of plastic. All typewriter cases had durable hard-rubber feet to allow for safe, upright storage. New in the box A new Royal Futura came with the following: * Locking luggage case (and One Key) * Two foam packing inserts ‚Ä¢ Instruction manual (which included a list of Service Centers Nationwide) ‚Ä¢ Dust cover and Luggage Tag (800 only) ‚Ä¢ One Twin-Pak ribbon Highlighted features Because the Futura (especially the 800 model) was designed with several features not found on other portable typewriters, the Royal Typewriter Company was eager to highlight the advantages of these features in its marketing materials. The following features were most often emphasized: * Magic Margins: two red buttons found on top of the carriage that were used to set the left and right margins. * Twin- Pak Ribbon: a proprietary design that facilitated quick and clean ribbon changing. ‚Ä¢ Magic Column Set: two buttons to add and remove tabs were located on the front panel of each Royal model 600 and 800 typewriter. ‚Ä¢ Personalized Touch Control: this allowed the typewriter key sensitivity (amount of typing force required) to be adjusted to one of ten levels via a lever located under the machine‚Äôs cover. In addition to these features, the durability of the Royal Futura was used as a selling point. The ‚Äú96 Year Test‚Äù was a machine stress test performed at an independent laboratory to prove that the Futura was a more durable machine than others in its class. Advertising and target market The Royal Futura was frequently advertised in print. Advertisements could be found in the Saturday Evening Post, Popular Photography, Scholastic Voice, and numerous newspapers nationwide. The most prominent campaign ran in Life Magazine from November 1958 until May 1962. Most of this advertising shared some underlying themes. First, the primary market was high school and college students or recent graduates. Second, the advertisements themselves were just as often targeted towards the parents as they were towards the students. Third, several advertisements alleged that owning a Royal typewriter would improve a student‚Äôs academic performance. In May and June 1961, a $10 student gift certificate was offered to encourage the purchase of a Futura. Both national and local advertisements often played up the Futura‚Äôs distinctive looks. Phrases such as ‚ÄúNew as outer space‚Äù and ‚ÄúYears ahead styling and construction‚Äù were representative of the taglines used during this time. Pricing The cost to purchase a Royal Futura varied by year and location. Advertisements overwhelmingly emphasized pricing for the full-featured model 800 and seldom mentioned the less-equipped models 400 and 600. The average price of a Royal Futura 800 was roughly $125 (U.S.) in 1960; this is $1000 in 2015 inflation-adjusted dollars (as per the Bureau of Labor statistics Consumer Price Index calculator). Notable users Famous users of the Royal Futura include: * US President Dwight D. Eisenhower * Writer Marguerite Yourcenar In films A - period-appropriate - periwinkle blue Royal Futura 800 appears in the 2011 movie The Help. Legacy Neither the name ‚ÄúFutura‚Äù nor its distinctive design was limited to the three portables described above. Including the original Futura models, there are twelve known typewriters that share the Futura body (if not always the same features, keys, or colors). There is one distinct design that shares the Futura name and there are several additional models that share Futura design elements. * From 1959 to 1962, Royal produced a similar typewriter line for sale exclusively at Montgomery-Ward. Models in this line were the 'Heritage', 'Heritage-Deluxe', and later the 'Heritage III'. In each case, the basic design was the same as the Futura‚Äôs. Differences included keys that were flatter (similar to the Royal Quiet DeLuxe) and a more muted range of color availability. * Beginning in 1961, two other Royal typewriters ‚Äì the \\"Tab-O-Matic\\" and the \\"All- American\\" - were built to similar specifications as the Futura but without features such as \\"Magic Margins\\" or \\"Touch-Control\\". A different color scheme was used for these models and they lacked design details such as the corrugated steel front panel and a push-button cover latch. As with the Futura 400 and 600, the \\"1\\" and \\"!\\" characters were not part of the standard typeface. However, unlike the lower-end Futura's, this typeface did include \\"+\\" and \\"=\\". Both the Tab-O-Matic and the All-American were sold at a substantially lower price point than was advertised for the Futura. * Also in 1961, the Royal Aristocrat ‚Äì a model which had been around since the 1930s - was given a Futura body. It had a blue top, a beige body, and a gold carriage and front plate. Its key configuration was like the Tab-O-Matic's but its key design was like the Quiet Deluxe. It came with a leather case like the Futura 800 but with the plastic handle found on later machines. The redesigned Aristocrat had the \\"Magic Column Set\\" but no \\"Magic Margins\\". Finally, the \\"Royal Aristocrat\\" label was merely a sticker as was found on the Heritage III, and All-American, but not found on the original Futura styles. * The Royaluxe 400, 425, and 450 were typewriters manufactured in Holland. All three made use of the Futura body (including the corrugated front plate). However, unlike other Futura derivatives, both the touch control and color selector were built into the exterior frame and could be accessed without opening the top of the machine. * Later in the 1960s (at least in 1968) Royal began to apply the Futura name to an entirely different machine. A gold and white typewriter with a design more like that of the Royal 890 was - for a limited time - sold as the \\"Futura\\". Finally, distinctive elements of the Futura body can be found in several other typewriters. Starting in 1961 and continuing throughout the decade, Futura design appeared in multiple Royal machines produced in Holland. Included were the: Royal Signet, Royal Parade, Royalite and Royalite 120, Royal Crescent, Royal Forward I (produced exclusively for Montgomery Ward), Royal Fiesta, and Royal Eldorado Deluxe. Although these machines were slim, budget portables aimed at a different customer base than the Futura was, their basic design is strongly reminiscent of Covey‚Äôs original vision.

Henik studies voluntary and automatic (non-voluntary/reflexive) processes involved in cognitive operations. He characterizes automatic processes (in various areas of research), and clarifies their importance, the relationship between automatic and voluntary processes, and their neural underpinnings. Most of his work involves research with human participants and in recent years, he has been working with Archer fish in order to examine evolutionary aspects of various cognitive functions.  Biography  Avishai Henik was born in Tel Aviv in 1945. He received his undergraduate degree in psychology and education from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 1971. He then moved to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to study for his MA and PhD degrees under the supervision of Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. He received his PhD in 1979. In 1980, Henik received a Rothschild post-doctoral fellowship and spent two years in Eugene, Oregon, in the laboratory of Michael I. Posner, considered a leading pioneer in building the field of cognitive neuroscience, and the neuropsychology laboratory led by Michael I. Posner and Oscar S.M. Marin in Portland, Oregon, U.S.A.  Academic career  Henik began as a lecturer at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 1979 and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1984, then to Associate Professor in 1992 and to a full Professor in 1996. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev endowed him with the Zlotowski Chair in Cognitive Neuropsychology in 1999 and a Distinguished Professor degree in 2014. He is currently continuing his research as an emeritus distinguished professor.  Academic Work  Avishai Henik heads the Cognitive Neuropsychology Laboratory. His work is multidisciplinary‚Äîhe studies mental operations, which serve as building blocks for a given cognitive function, as well as the brain tissues involved in these operations. His early works focused on single word processing and the Stroop effect and later on visual spatial attention, numerical cognition, dyscalculia, emotions, and synesthesia. He has written over 200 articles, in addition to an edited book entitled, Continuous Issues in Numerical Cognition: How Many or How Much. =Attention= Henik started his work on attention under the supervision of Daniel Kahneman in the middle of the 1970s. Kahneman and Henik published two papers on selective attention, one of which has been heavily cited throughout the years. Since then, Henik studied the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie orienting of visual-spatial attention and selective attention. Studies conducted in his laboratory and in collaboration with other researchers (e.g., Robert Rafal) documented the distinction between the involuntary-exogenous and the voluntary-endogenous attentional systems, the cortical and subcortical neural structures that subserve these systems, and developmental trajectories in attention. His studies, on patients as well as the Archer fish, documented the role of subcortical structures (e.g., superior colliculus) in inhibition of return (IOR). His research on selective attention uses a range of tasks like the Stroop, flanker, and the stop-signal task, which require selection and control over habitual responding. This research led Henik to study cognitive control and executive functions. = Cognitive Control and Emotional Self-Regulation = Henik's research in this area aims at understanding the development of goal-directed behavior and self-regulation. Research in his laboratory has shown that cognitive control and emotional regulation could work in top-down or bottom-up pathways. Emotions, commonly thought to involve subcortical structures (e.g., amygdala), can be regulated by cognitive control (that involves higher brain structures in the cerebral cortex) and are affected by training. Moreover, attentional alerting (thought to involve subcortical brain structures) was found to modulate cognitive control / executive functions. = Numerical Cognition = Henik studies the building blocks of numerical cognition and developmental dyscalculia‚Äîa specific deficiency in arithmetic that is similar in nature and prevalence to dyslexia. Together with Joseph Tzelgov, Henik designed the numerical Stroop task and showed (a) the intimate relationship between sizes and numbers, and (b) the fact that numerical values are processed automatically even when completely irrelevant to the task. In subsequent years, it was found that performance in the numerical Stroop task depends on knowledge of the numerical system, involves specific brain areas (i.e., the cortical intraparietal sulcus), and is compromised in developmental dyscalculia and acalculia. In recent years Henik pointed out the importance of non-countable dimensions (e.g., which object is larger in size, how much water is in the glass) to numerical cognition. In recent publications, Henik and colleagues suggested the existence of a magnitude sense rather than a number sense, with the former based on the ability to perceive and evaluate non- countable dimensions (e.g., size). Henik and colleagues edited two books in numerical cognition. One dealt with the role of continuous dimensions and one with heterogeneity of functions involved in numerical cognition. = Synesthesia = It has been suggested that synesthesia can serve as a window to understanding crucial issues in object perception such as feature binding, and that it documents cross-talk between supposedly separate systems (e.g., vision and audition). In studies of synesthesia, Henik and his colleagues combined behavioral and brain imaging techniques as well as harnessed other techniques (e.g., hypnosis) in order to examine fundamental issues in the field. Academic Administration Henik assumed various roles in academic administration. At BGU, he was Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Chairperson for the Department of Behavioral Sciences, and for the Zlotowski Center for Neuroscience. On a national level (Israel), he was a member of the first board of directors of FIRST (Focal Initiative in Research in Science and Technology, Bikura), founded by the Israel Science Foundation (ISF). He was also a member of the CHE (Council of Higher Education) international committee for the evaluation of accredited Psychology and Behavioral Sciences studies in Israel. On an international level, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the European Society for Cognitive Psychology (ESCoP) and the Chair of the Governing Board of the recently established Mathematical Cognition and Learning Society (MCLS). Notable Grant Support Henik was the instigator and Chair of a multidisciplinary think-tank, sponsored by the Israeli Ministry of Education, whose function was to better understand the cross roads where neuroscience, cognitive science and education meet. The aim was to identify developments in the field and the ramifications for education. Henik was also supported by the ISF in the framework of a Center of Excellence for the study of numerical cognition. At the time, this center was the only one in Psychology that was awarded funding since Humanities and Social Sciences were added to the Centers of Excellence program in 2000. In 2012, Henik won a prestigious European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Researcher Grant, which is awarded to allow exceptional, established research leaders to pursue ground-breaking, high-risk projects that open new directions in their research field. Henik's ERC grant was awarded to study the role of size perception and evaluation in numerical cognition. The main methods involved in this research include behavioral studies dealing with typical and atypical development of numerical concepts, imaging studies, work on lower animals (i.e., Archer fish, who are able to evaluate sizes but who do not have a cerebral cortex, which is thought to be central in arithmetic) and examination of computational aspects of development through evolutionary algorithms.  Notable Awards  * 2017 - Excellent Mentor Prize, awarded by the Israel Society for Neuroscience (ISFN) for exceptional mentoring in neuroscience. * 2018 - Humboldt Research Award, awarded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, in recognition of accomplishments in research and teaching. * 2020 - FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence Mentoring Prize 2020, awarded by the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and the Kavli Foundation scholars network for demonstrated leadership in fostering the careers of neuroscientists.

Shinto's rise in Korea is directly associated with the Japanese government's ideological use of the traditional folk practices of Japan, later described as \\"State Shinto.\\" As Japan expanded its control of Korea, it also expanded the number of shrines, with the aim of one national shrine in each province. By 1945, attendance at shrines was in many cases compulsory. Early 20th century Japanese postcard showing the Ch≈çsen Shrine in Seoul (1925-1945) Introduction of Shinto Japan's Meiji restoration had been actively rejecting any relationship between Shinto, the folk tradition of Japan, and religious belief. Imperial Japan interpreted Shinto as a \\"suprareligious\\" institution based on a set of traditions, rather than moral instructions. As such, requirements to participate in Shinto ceremonies were not deemed to be a violation of the Meiji-era's freedom of religion doctrine. This was the position of the state, later described as \\"State Shinto,\\" and not necessarily followed by priests or practitioners of Shinto. =Introduction of shrines= The earliest Shinto shrine in Korea is believed to be , later , built in 1678, built by workers of the local Japan House trade office. In 1876, the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of Amity introduced Japanese settlers, and Shinto proselytizers, to Incheon, Pusan, and Wonsan. As Japanese traders arrived in these ports, they brought Shinto practices with them. For example, , in Wonsan, was constructed in 1882, and was later elevated to National Shrine status by the Japanese in 1936. By 1911, , , and shrines had been established, ostensibly for the practice of Japanese nationals living there. Other active groups included , , , and . After the Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, Korea was fully under Japanese rule. In turn, the Governor-General responsible for managing Korea for Imperial Japan was empowered to expand the use of shrines there. A year later, a police report on shrine activities in Korea stated that \\"shrines are established for the purpose of the protection of local areas, and are deeply revered among many residents. Shrines are managed along with other civic groups by the local association of Japanese residents.\\" In 1913, to mark the anniversary of the occupation, members of the Korean royal family presented an offering to Amaterasu at a Shinto shrine in Seoul, signaling their subordination to the Japanese government. Meanwhile, Japanese expatriates at this time were protective of Japanese customs, and reluctant to engage or inform Koreans about shrine practices, despite government orders to promote them, and the Japanese government struggled to incorporate Korean nationals into leadership roles at the shrines. Ch≈çsen Shrine, in Seoul, was built in 1920 and was named an Imperial Shrine in 1925 (a few months ahead of completion). It was the first Korean shrine to be funded by the state, and was established as the first in a series of national shrines to be built in each Korean province. By the 1930s, it was the Korean Governor-General's policy to build a Shinto shrine in every village in Korea, and the total reached 995 by the end of the Japanese occupation in 1945. This was 57 percent of all shrines Japan built outside of Japan during the war. These shrines were more aggressive in their outreach to locals than the expatriate-led shrines had been before. =Compulsory attendance= In 1925, primary school students and staff were required to attend local shrines as part of a \\"Imperial subject-making\\" initiative, k≈çminka seisaku. In 1936, shrine worship was made compulsory for university students as well. Schools refusing to participate in these trips could be closed. Under the National Mobilization law of 1938, laws requiring Christian schools to visit shrines were expanded to include all Christians. That September, members of a Presbyterian church in Korea were forced to visit a shrine by soldiers with bayonets. The Shinto Shrine Issue The question of whether or not it was acceptable for Christians to attend shrine ceremonies was a dilemma that deeply divided the Korean Church particularly during the 1930s, with Presbyterians being more strongly opposed and the Methodists and Roman Catholics more tolerant of the practice. It was however foreign missionaries who had originally been the most outspoken on the issue, but their opposition had meant many were no longer able to stay in Korea, particularly in the north. On one hand many churches and mission groups believed that it was idolatry, while many other churches came to trust the Japanese when they claimed that the ceremonies weren't religious in nature but rather just ultra-nationalism. The latter believed that fundamental opposition to shrine worship was doing more harm to Christianity in Korea than it was doing good. Thus, in order to appease the Japanese colonialists and keep Christian schools open, many Christians became increasingly tolerant of shrine worship including the Presbyterian General Assembly, once so opposed to the practice. As more Christians took part in shrine worship, it weakened the argument for the fundamentalists; ‚Äòif it‚Äôs okay for them to do it, then so can you‚Äô. Post-WWII, even today, the Shrine question remains a sensitive issue among Korean Christians. While many considered it to have been a tactful necessity to keep the Church visible, many were disappointed by the lack of gospel faithfulness Christian leaders displayed in the face of persecution; which they so often preached about. In the following decades, many pastors (but not all) repented for compromising their faith during Japanese colonialism and were strongly encouraged to be a 'sheep' for a short period as way of restoring the integrity of their faith.  Integration with Korean tradition  Japanese Imperial scholars such as Ry≈´z≈ç Torii and Ogasawara Sh≈çz≈ç advocated the position that Korean and Japanese folk traditions shared a common, shamanic link, which bolstered Imperial Japanese claims about the legitimacy of the Korean occupation. This argument lead them to encourage fusing the worship of the Meiji Emperor with Dankun („Å†„Çì„Åè„Çì), a legendary founder of Korea. A Korean scholar, Sai Nanzen, challenged this belief by asserting that Tan'gun was the origination point of Shinto, urging a reconsideration of Shinto as one, localized aspect of a broader shamanistic tradition in Asia. Nam-seon was eventually pressured to promote the idea that Shinto was the key manifestation of this tradition, and that all Asian folk traditions were essentially Shinto in other forms. Other intellectuals at the time emphasized what came to be called \\"the Inheritance Myth.\\" This argued that Dankun, the \\"Kami\\" of Korea, had passed control of Korean land to the Imperial family, owing to the families deep ties to the Shinto sun goddess, Amaterasu Omikami. However, the State apparatus declined to fully incorporate Tan'gun into Chosen Shrine, which housed only the kami of Amaterasu ≈åmikami and Emperor Meiji. Post-war With Japan's surrender and the invasion of Korea, Shinto shrines became the focus of contempt, such as with papers posted on walls urging citizens to burn them down. As Koreans began pilfering smaller shrines around the country, Shinto priests at Ch≈çsen Shrine withdrew Japanese relics, and soon created a plan to destroy the Korean National Shrine of their own accord. The site has since been replaced with the Ahn Jung-geun Memorial Museum.

Personal life Lee Oras Overholts was born in Camden, Ohio and attended Miami University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912. His postgraduate education was at Washington University where his Ph.D. was awarded in 1915. He was married twice, to Flora May Conarroe (died 7 June 1944) and then Marie Knautz. He had four children, two girls and two boys. Overholts died 10 November 1946 at State College after a very short illness although he had been unwell for the five previous years. Scientific career During the course of his graduate school research, he met prominent mycologists such as Bruce Fink, Frank Dunn Kern, and Edward Angus Burt and developed an interest in the polypores. In 1915 Overholts accepted the offer of a faculty post at Pennsylvania State University from Kern. He started teaching courses in botany, and later in mycology and forest pathology. He became a full professor in 1925. Overholts described 35 polypore fungi either alone or with his colleague Josiah Lincoln Lowe. However, Overholts often neglected to include a Latin description, contrary to the then-prevailing rules of botanical nomenclature, and consequently a large proportion of his species were published invalidly.

Formed in 2013, the band consists of Tom Ogden (lead vocals, guitar), Charlie Salt (bass, backing vocals), Josh Dewhurst (lead guitar, percussion), Joe Donovan (drums) and Myles Kellock (keyboards, synthesizer, backing vocals). They were on the BBC's Sound Of new music list for 2016 where they finished in fourth place. It was commented by the band and several other people that they were one of only two guitar bands on the list, alongside Rat Boy. Blossoms' self-titled debut album was one of the twelve albums nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2017, that same year they were nominated for British Breakthrough Act at the Brit Awards. Career=Pre-Blossoms and formation= Unknown at the time, all members of the bands were born in Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, and lived within a 2 miles of each other whilst growing up. Tom Ogden and Joe Donovan met through a school trip to Alton Towers, which both of them were placed on due to good attendance, in 2005. During their time in high school they became 'into bands' from the local Manchester music scene such as Oasis and The Stone Roses and saw both aforementioned bands together. Donovan previously knew bassist Charlie Salt as all members of Blossoms went to the same secondary school though not at the same time. Ogden began writing songs aged 15 despite not being in a band due to encouragement from his father. Salt was previously a member of Mutineers with former Haven rhythm section Iwan Gronow and Jack Mitchell. After high school Donovan and later Ogden went on to have jobs at the Alma Lodge Hotel as event staff, they were later joined by Kellock who got a job by Ogden's good word after he joined the unnamed band that would come to be Blossoms. Kellock previously worked at a Co-Op. The Alma Lodge Hotel also served as the venue to the first bands that all five members were in, Salt and guitarist Josh Dewhurst featuring in other bands. After all featuring on the same bill Salt and Dewhurst gravitated toward the other members of Blossoms, together eventually becoming members of the band in January 2013. Ogden, Donovan and Kellock often spent time on their shifts discussing the band and playing demos which got them into trouble several times. On 3 April 2013, Blossoms played their first gig in the Night and Day Cafe on Oldham Street, Manchester for ¬£3 entry. =Early work= Upon Salt joining the band, they gained a rehearsal space, his grandfather's scaffolding yard which proved ideal as they were able to use it without paying for the time. The scaffolding yard is the location featured on the cover of their debut album. The band take their name from The Blossoms public house at the corner of Bramhall Lane and Buxton Road in Stockport. Donovan heard both Ogden and Salt mention how apt Blossoms was as a band name on separate occasions, leading to the naming of the band as Blossoms. They have since played shows at The Blossoms. In January 2014, the band released their first single, \\"You Pulled a Gun on Me\\", and on 14 January they released a video for the song. The video was self-produced with a small budget of ¬£60. \\"You Pulled a Gun on Me\\" was recorded at Eve Studios in Stockport. In Spring 2014, Blossoms were signed to Skeleton Key Records (owned by James Skelly of The Coral). From March through to August 2014, Blossoms embarked upon their first UK tour to promote the Bloom EP though they only played weekend shows due to all members of the band still holding full-time jobs, other than Dewhurst who was only 16 and still in full-time education. They got their first write up on the Louder Than War music website, played their first festival (Tramlines in Sheffield at Yellow Arch Studios) and opened for James at Castlefield Bowl to 8,000 people, on 11 July 2014, which they described as a turning point in the band's future. Skelly produced their first official single \\"Blow\\", released 26 August 2014, the video being shot at the scaffolding yard that was still being used as a rehearsal space. In autumn 2014, Blossoms quit their jobs to fully pursue the band and subsequently went on to do another full UK tour, this time selling out the Manchester date, hosted by Sound Control, a venue made famous by The Stone Roses and New Order. They also sold out a show at the Deaf Institute, Manchester on 1 November. Over the winter, Blossoms went back into Parr Street Studios with James Skelly to record \\"Cut Me and I'll Bleed\\", for which they announced an extensive UK tour between 31 January and 28 March 2015. Due to them having a contact in the business, the singer Liam Fray, this promoted them to tour with The Charlatans and The Courteeners in March 2015. On 18 March, Blossoms were invited by BBC Introducing to play a set for the Official SXSW Showcase at Latitude 30 in Austin, Texas. Blossoms recorded and released the Blown Rose EP between June and July, the video once again shot at the scaffolding yard, released on 31 July along with the EP itself. This was the first EP released as part of Blossoms' new record deal with Virgin EMI though they only announced the new contract on 18 August. The band still work with James Skelly as their producer. They went on to play a summer of festivals such as The Great Escape, Y Not and Reading and Leeds whilst also supporting the Courteeners for their Heaton Park show. Blossoms headlined their first festival stage on 5 September at Tim Peak's Diner as part of Festival No. 6. This was released as a 10\\" vinyl disc for Record Store Day 2017. =\\"Charlemagne\\" and debut album= Recording for the debut album began in September 2015. On 4 October Blossoms announced that their next single would be \\"Charlemagne\\" and released the song on iTunes and Spotify on 5 October. On 30 October the Charlemagne EP was released featuring three other songs (\\"Across the Moor\\", \\"For Evelyn\\" and \\"Polka Dot Bones\\"). \\"Charlemagne\\" went on to commercial success and became BBC Radio 1's track of the day and featured on Spotify's 'Spotlight on 2016' list. The commercial success extended through to December where Charlemagne topped the Christmas vinyl chart. On 5 January Blossoms announced their At Most a Kiss EP and released the song, with the video following. Whilst doing promotion for the EP Blossoms played the Radio 1 Live Lounge, covering WSTRN's \\"In2\\". They announced on 22 January that recording for their debut album was complete. Whilst on their third headline tour Blossoms had support from Viola Beach, who were killed mid-tour in a car crash with their manager on 13 February. Blossoms played a recorded set from a Royal Leamington Spa performance for the remaining tour dates in the slot that Viola Beach would have otherwise played in. The At Most a Kiss EP was released on 23 February. On 12 April Annie Mac played their song \\"Getaway\\" for the first time on BBC Radio 1 before a midnight release of the single on iTunes and Spotify. In May it was announced that Blossoms would play their biggest show to date and support the Stone Roses at Etihad Stadium on 15 June after Ian Brown became a fan of the band. Once again Blossoms are playing a summer of festivals, being clocked up to 41 festivals by Dewhurst. Blossoms' eponymous debut album was released on 5 August with \\"My Favourite Room\\" and \\"Honey Sweet\\" being released to pre-orders early as singles. It was met with mostly favourable reviews and peaked at the top of the UK Albums Chart in its first week, giving Blossoms their first number-one album. Blossoms featured on the August cover of NME magazine. An autumn tour to support the album release also sold out including a performance at Stockport‚Äôs Plaza Theatre at midnight on the day of the album's release. On 9 September 2017, Blossoms performed at Manchester Arena as part of We Are Manchester to mark the reopening of the venue following a terrorist attack there three months prior. =Cool Like You= Cool Like You was their second studio album. It was released in the United Kingdom on 27 April 2018, by Virgin EMI Records. The album was produced by James Skelly and Rich Turvey. It peaked at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart, and at number 1 on the Official Vinyl Albums Chart. Subsequently after this, the band followed up the album‚Äôs release with a UK tour which was completely sold out, including a night at the O2 Apollo in Manchester and three shows at Stockport Plaza. After playing some festivals in the summer, Blossoms announced another UK tour for December, including two nights at Manchester‚Äôs O2 Victoria Warehouse and the O2 Brixton Academy in London. The entire tour sold out within minutes on the day tickets went on sale. In June 2019 Blossoms played a homecoming show at Edgeley Park Stadium, selling out every ticket in under an hour. =Foolish Loving Spaces= The band released their third album, Foolish Loving Spaces, on 31 January 2020. The album was preceded by the singles ‚ÄúYour Girlfriend‚Äù, \\"The Keeper\\" and \\"If You Think This Is Real Life\\".

Biography He was born in Fano in the region of Marche, Italy, but studied musical composition at the Arrigo Boito Conservatory at Parma. From there, he gained the position directing the orchestra at the Dirigentschule in Munich. There he married Danica Pavloviƒá, descendant of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty and cousin of the King Petar I of Serbia. Together they had one daughter, Milena Pavloviƒá-Barili, who became a prominent Serbian painter. Returning to Italy in 1910, Barilli composed the opera Medusa with libretto by O. Schanzer. In 1914, the opera was awarded at the MacCormick competition. Barilli wrote the music and libretto for the opera Emiral (1915), awarded a prize in a Roman competition judged by Giacomo Puccini. As an actor, he is known for performance in La Rosa (1921). But Barilli is known mainly for his prolific writing and editing as a music critic for numerous journals including La Concordia(1915‚Äì16); Il Tempo (1917‚Äì22);Corriere italiano (1923‚Äì24); Il Tevere (1925-33); Gazzetta del Popolo; Risorgimento liberale; L' Unit√†, and others. His essays, both on music and travel, have been published in collected form in books titled Delirama (1924);Delirama, 1948 edition. Il sorcio nel violino (1926); Il paese del melodramma (1931); Lo spettatore stralunato: cronache cinematografiche; Il sole in trappola: diario del periplo dell'Africa (1931); Il paese del melodramma; and Capricci di vegliardo among others. During the early decades of the twentieth century, he was living in the Villa Strohl Fern, and active in the Roman artistic circles that habitually met at the Caff√® Aragno on Via del Corso, a caf√© known as the rendezvous of the city's literary and artistic elite. Here he met with friends Emilio Cecchi, Antonio Baldini, and Vincenzo Cardarelli, but also encountered Ungaretti, Carlo Socrate , Soffici, Pasqualina Spadini, Mario Broglio, Armando Ferri, Quirino Ruggeri, Roberto Longhi, Riccardo Francalancia, and Aurelio Saffi. Barilli's portrait was painted in 1928 by Massimo Campigli.Review on exhibit Bruno Barilli, writer, artist, and tight-rope walker at Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Rome], article in Corriere della Sera by Edoardo Sassi. In 1925 he signed on to the Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals, written by Giovanni Gentile. Barilli seems to have ultimately soured on his support for fascism. From 1939 al 1941, he collaborated in the weekly Oggi, whose editor was Arrigo Benedetti till the journal was suppressed by the authorities. His brother Arnaldo was a local art historian, and the brother Latino a painter. Bruno was the uncle of the actor of Cecrope Barilli, great-uncle of actress Carlotta Barilli, actor and film director Francesco Barilli, and costume designer Evelina Barilli.IMDB database, entry on Barilli.

Steve Pintolivo (Andrew de Burgh), a recent university graduate, receives a Facebook message from a beautiful woman named Tamara Nolan (Barbara Nedeljakova) inviting him to her Hollywood apartment for a New Year's Eve party. Over some Colombian marijuana the next day, Steve and his former classmate Derek Urden (Isaac Anderson) discuss a variety of topics including the possible evolution of man and a former right hand man of Josef Stalin who recently spoke to Derek's religion class about his conversion to Christianity. When the topic of Stalin's underling comes up, Steve quickly changes the subject to Tamara and the invitation. They decide to go to the party but when they arrive, only Tamara is there. However, the two young men soon fall for her charm and are tricked into drinking a cocktail laced with a very powerful sedative that knocks them out within seconds. When they wake up, Steve and Derek find themselves in a dark basement strapped to an operating table and chair, respectively. Tamara casually walks in holding a syringe and injects Derek with a colorless liquid, killing him instantly. She mentions to Steve that an old man used to live there.

It is fully owned by Christchurch City Holdings (CCHL), the investment arm of the Christchurch City Council. History Enable Networks was first launched in 2007 with funding from CCHL and a grant from the Ministry of Economic Development. Initially launched as Christchurch City Networks Limited (CCNL), in 2009 the company re- branded as Enable Networks and later simplified its trading name to Enable. In 2007, whether or not an area would be served by fibre broadband or not was mostly Telecom New Zealand's decision. As Telecom was trying to get as much out of its existing copper network and upgrades in Christchurch were uncertain, Christchurch City Council decided to set up its own fibre broadband company through its trading arm, Christchurch City Holdings. The initial outcome was a small network that served 60 schools, health providers and businesses. There were plans to double the length of the network within three years, but the National Government announced the Ultra-Fast Broadband initiative in 2009. Enable Networks and Chorus Limited, a Telecom subsidiary, tendered for the work. Negotiations with the government took one year and were completed in April 2011, when Enable Networks was assigned the network rollout for Christchurch, Rangiora, Kaiapoi, Woodend, Lincoln, Prebbleton, and Rolleston. Enable partnered with the government's Crown Fibre Holdings on the project, with the city's cost projected to be NZ$203m, and the Crown's cost estimated to be NZ$170. The overall costs were later revised to NZ$440m, with the Crown's contribution lowered to NZ$140m, but their equity stake in Enable Networks was converted to an interest-free loan in June 2016. Enable Networks does not expect to make a profit prior to 2021. The company's first employee was Steve Fuller, who had previously been an executive manager at Telecom. Fuller is to this day Enable Networks' chief executive. Construction under the contract with the Crown started in November 2011. The 50% completion mark was hit in October 2014. In April 2015, uptake was just under 15% of the possible connections. By mid-2016, 67% of the network had been built. Of the 118,000 homes and businesses that could connect to the network, 22% have chosen to do so, and this update is above the expectations. By July 2017, Enable announced over 50,000 of the 150,000 homes and businesses that could connect, had chosen to do so. The government's target date for the rollout is 2019, but Enable announced in October 2014 that it will deliver the network a year earlier, i.e. by 31 December 2018. In May 2018 Enable Networks completed its network build programme to Christchurch. Also completing additional areas of Kennedys Bush, Ohoka, Tuahiwi, Clearwater and Tai Tapu. Enable Networks used Transfield as its key contractor for the network build, but there were serious tensions between the companies.

His role in a controversy over Canadian naval operations in 1943, near the height of the Battle of the Atlantic, continues to be debated by Canadian naval historians. In 1943 MacLean's criticisms of the leadership of the Royal Canadian Navy, based on his personal experience and published in one of his magazines, led to questions in the House of Commons about the management of naval operations. Further investigations later that year eroded beyond repair the naval minister's confidence in Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles, until then chief of the Canadian naval staff, and Nelles was replaced early in 1944. Early years Andrew MacLean was born in Toronto, the only child of Hugh Cameron MacLean and Elizabeth ('Bessie') Emma Matilda (n√©e Dyas) MacLean. His mother died when he was six months old and he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Emma Ball Dyas. His grandfather, Thomas W. Dyas, was the advertising and circulations manager of The Toronto Mail and of the Toronto Empire, and a founder of A. McKim and Company, the first advertising agency in Canada. MacLean was educated at Appleby College, Upper Canada College, and University of Toronto Schools.http://www.archeion.ca/Andrew-d-maclean-family-fonds The Maclean publishing enterprises  In the 1880s and 1890s, MacLean's father Hugh and uncle John Bayne Maclean ‚Äî they adopted different spellings of their surname ‚Äì worked together to build a substantial Canadian publishing enterprise. In 1899 J.B. Maclean bought out his brother and assumed full control of the Maclean Publishing Company, which later became Maclean-Hunter and then Rogers Communications. Hugh MacLean built a separate company, Hugh C. MacLean Publications, later part of Southam Publishing, then Canwest and then Postmedia News. J.B. Maclean's son and heir Hector Andrew Fitzroy MacLean died in 1919, and he soon after proposed that Andrew MacLean, his nephew, succeed to a controlling interest in his publishing empire.http://wwwarcheion.ca/andrew-d-maclean-family-fonds Andrew MacLean, however, would make his business career with his father at Hugh C. MacLean Publications. Control of Maclean-Hunter eventually passed to Horace T. Hunter and other associates of J.B. Maclean, including Floyd Chalmers.Floyd Chalmers (1969) A Gentleman of the Press, John Bayne Maclean. Toronto: Doubledday Naval career and controversy At the outbreak of the First World War, MacLean volunteered for service in the Royal Navy. After initial rejection because he was underage, he graduated from Royal Naval College, Greenwich in January 1917 and was commissioned as a Sub-lieutenant R.N.V.R.. He served in the Mediterranean with the First Submarine Hunting Flotilla. He was promoted on the recommendation of Admiral Sir David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty and served in HMS Cleopatra ‚Äì a fast cruiser that saw action in the North Sea with the Grand Fleet. He witnessed the German Navy's surrender at Scapa Flow. From 1927 to 1931, as a member of the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, he commanded the Toronto naval reserve station HMCS York. At the outbreak of the Second World War, while awaiting call up as a Canadian reserve naval officer, the ever-patriotic MacLean joined the Royal Canadian Air Force RCAF and served in its Marine Section before returning to the Royal Canadian Navy [RCN]. Sent on loan to the Royal Navy, he was given command of a convoy trawler, HMS St. Zeno. He later represented the Admiralty for the acceptance trials of Fairmile Submarine Chasers and Motor Gun Boats. He was ordered back to Canada to organise RCN Submarine Chasers and became Senior Officer Fairmiles. Fairmiles, motor launches 34 metres long with a crew of about 15, were useful for coastal duties, but the ocean-going anti-submarine war was dominated by corvettes. MacLean campaigned for modernization and reorganization of the Fairmile fleet and, more generally, for better treatment of reserve officers like himself. MacLean saw the careerism of some civil servants and senior officers as dereliction of duty. His frustration with the naval command led to his retirement from the navy in October 1942, age 45.Richard O. Mayne (2006). Betrayed: Scandal, Politics and Canadian Naval Leadership. Vancouver: UBC Press, pp. 12-41. He returned to the family publishing business and subsequently made his concerns public in an issue of Boating Magazine.MacLean, Andrew D.

MacLean outlined his experience with the Fairmiles and argued that the expertise of patriotic and dedicated naval reserve personnel like himself was being dismissed by the small coterie of permanent force officers who dominated Canadian naval headquarters. MacLean's blunt criticisms provoked questions in the Canadian Parliament and a rebuttal from the Minister of National Defence for naval services, Angus Lewis MacdonaldAngus Macdonald, \\"Half Truths and Evasions Feature Naval Minister's Reply to BOATING's Charges\\" in Boating Magazine. 19:2, March‚ÄìApril 1943. pp. 34-38. Republished at andrewdmaclean.ca The controversy over MacLean's charges was followed in the summer and fall of 1943 by confidential in-service criticisms from active duty officers, many of them reserve officers. These focussed on the outdated equipment and inadequate training of the RCN corvette fleet that was then engaged in transatlantic convoy duty and the anti- submarine campaign. The Naval Minister lost confidence in Vice-Admiral Percy C. Nelles, and he was removed as Chief of the Naval Staff in January 1944.David J. Bercuson (2015). Our Finest Hour: Canada Fights the Second World War, Toronto: HarperCollins, pp. 259-62. Nelles's strengths and weaknesses, and the degree to which MacLean's attack had eroded Minister Macdonald's confidence in the naval high command before the corvette officers' \\"equipment crisis,\\" continue to be debated by Canadian scholars.David J.

It is managed by Hywel Dda University Health Board. It is the only acute hospital within mid-Wales and is the main hospital for the students of Aberystwyth University. History The hospital has its origins in Aberystwyth Dispensary which was founded in Great Darkgate Street in 1821. It moved to Upper Portland Street as the Aberystwyth Infirmary and Cardiganshire General Hospital in 1838, to Little Darkgate Street in 1858 and to North Road in 1888. It joined the National Health Service as Aberystwyth and Cardiganshire General Hospital in 1948. Following the demolition of the Aberystwyth Union Workhouse, it moved to the site previously occupied by the workhouse in Caradog Road in 1966. A new accident and emergency department opened in March 2013. Local perceptions of under-investment in the hospital led the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care to conclude in 2014 that there was \\"a near-dysfunctional level of mistrust, misunderstanding and concern\\" about the health board's plans.

The attraction incorporates virtual reality, motion simulation and illusions in collaboration with British mentalist Derren Brown. It is set in a derelict Victorian railway depot with a loose theme of fracking. It first opened in July 2016. History Thorpe Park had not featured a large horror-themed dark ride since the closure of Phantom Fantasia (later known as \\"Wicked Witches Haunt\\") in 2000. Derren Brown's Ghost Train was first teased on 8 July 2015 after three years in the planning stage, during which it was referred to as 'WC16'.Attraction Fix Merlin Magic Making, the creative division of Merlin Entertainments, designed the attraction in conjunction with Derren Brown and his team. The ride is a simulated dark ride created by Simworks, while the virtual reality content and delivery was produced by Figment Productions. Severn Lamb and Intamin engineered the transit system that takes riders from one scene to another within the building. Shortly before its scheduled opening on 6 May 2016, Thorpe Park announced that the ride would not be completed in time to open as scheduled. A further delay was announced on 24 May stating the ride would not open at the end of the month as planned. On 18 June, the ride began previews for hotel guests and select groups. During this period, guests were made to sign a non-disclosure form before riding to prevent any details being shared online or on social media. This was followed on 30 June when the ride opened for technical rehearsals. Derren Brown's Ghost Train officially opened on 8 July 2016, with an official press and celebrity night taking place on 21 July. The ride continues to experience problems with its operation. The project altogether was reported in the Financial Times as having a cost of ¬£13 million.Merlin looks to Derren Brown for touch of magic - Financial Times. 6 May 2016. Retrieved 1 August 2016. Due to its complex operation, Derren Brown's Ghost Train features the longest list of guest restrictions ever necessitated for a ride operated by Merlin Entertainments, a fact that was repeatedly utilised in the ride's advertising. Guests under the age of 13 are not recommended to ride because of what Thorpe Park claims as the \\"extreme psychological nature\\" of the experience. On 5 October 2016 Thorpe Park put up posters advertising the addition of a \\"terrifying new destination\\" to the ride for 2017. These were later followed by the park filing for planning permission to extend the attraction's building. On 17 January 2017 Thorpe Park confirmed that these applications were for a new ride experience named Rise of the Demon. Ride experience Guests join the queue for the ride outside the building, decorated as a derelict railway station featuring mock protest posters about fracking. During the queue a group photo is sometimes taken. Guests enter a dimly lit pre-show room until the light source is switched off and they are left in the dark room. An audio recording of Derren Brown begins to play stating that \\" statistically 11% of the guests are scared of the dark, 34% are scared of small spaces\\" then jokingly presents the figure that \\"3% will wet themselves due to the sight of a stupid clown\\". He then begins to explain that \\"the fascinating thing in the situation the guests are in is not fear itself but the pleasure that one gains from it\\". He compares this to a ghost train, \\"you don't ride it to be petrified, you ride it to become immersed in the fantasy like world of it all\\". Continuing, he explains that the prospect of this is presented to us at a very young age. The surrounding audio kicks in as Derren quietly whispers \\"shh\\" followed by the sound of a door slamming behind you and a baby laughing. Guests then proceed to the main platform where an old North Eastern Railway train carriage is seen as if suspended above the floor by chains. Boarding the train, guests enter a modern London Underground carriage interior hosted by uniformed staff. Guests are seated and put on HTC Vive headsets, whilst an advertisement for a fracking company called \\"Sub Core\\" is played in the background. The train feels as though it has started to move and the ride begins. Riders watch the events through virtual reality, involving a passenger on the train discussing the consequences of a fracking disaster and an infected passenger appearing to attack the rider. Following the scene of a train crash, guests are instructed to leave their seats and exit the carriage. Riders disembark and walk out into a derelict present day tube station, while the exterior of the carriage is now seen to be a modern London Underground train. The following show scene originally involved live actors, an animated train crash and fog projection, before guests are ushered back onto the carriage. However, this scene was replaced with a strobe maze after 2 seasons. Riders put the headsets back on and the carriage appears to move again. This second VR sequence involves the train and its passengers appearing to be attacked by a demon. Guests appear to fall out of the train into a fiery Hell and into the mouth of the demon. Finally, Derren Brown's voice is heard announcing that the experience is now over, and the riders are ushered down to what appears to be the ride's shop. There, a staff member asks the guests to wait a few minutes, reporting that a mess caused by a previous rider must be cleaned up. After leaving, the demon reappears in the \\"shop\\" as a jumpscare. The attraction lasts approximately 13 minutes. Controversy In anticipation of the new attraction, Thorpe Park began a \\"Get in for a Bob\\" promotion, where 1871 people would be able to purchase a ticket into the resort for the modern day equivalent of a shilling in Victorian times, which equals 5 pence. The promotion required the public to find a code (DBGT1871), scattered in various related articles across the web, to then enter it (along with some personal details) into the dedicated website on 25 March 2016. The website was published earlier than the scheduled time which resulted in many guests being unable to get tickets.http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/25/thorpe-park-started-selling- their-12p-tickets-early-and-people-are-furious-5775080/ This caused mass outrage on the resort's major social media platforms, with some members of the public demanding their personal details removed from the resort's systems. The resort soon offered a compromise, in which those who registered their name before the website closed would be entered into a raffle, where a further 4,000 12 pence tickets would be allocated at random.https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/thorpe-park-promises-angry- families-7736418 The attraction was originally set to open on 6 May 2016, as announced on their social networks. However one week before the attraction was set to open, the resort announced the attraction would not be ready due to \\"some illusions not working as anticipated\\".http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/whats- on/family-kids-news/thorpe-park-postpones-opening-date-11274915 At this stage TV adverts were stating the ride would open in the end of May. However, only days before 31 May, the resort announced the attraction would still not be ready in time and the attractions opening date was changed to \\"coming soon\\". The attraction finally opened on 8 July 2016, but has suffered ongoing repeated technical problems and was rarely if ever operating for the full day.

The team was founded in 1966, and the organization was closed after Harry Melling bought the team from George Elliott. History=Primary Car History= The primary car for Elliott Racing was the No. 9 car. The No. 9 began in 1976 with driver Bill Elliott, car owner George Elliott and crew chief Ernie Elliott (Bill's brother). In 1976 Elliott Racing ran six races, with Bill Elliott driving four races (California 500, Atlanta 500, Winston 500 and World 600), David Hobbs ran the Champion Spark Plug 400 and Al Holbert ran the National 500.

In the fall of 1980, Elliott Racing gained its first major sponsor in the form of $500 from Harry Melling in the 1980 National 500 at Charlotte. Melling would extend his contract and gave the team enough sponsorship to run a 12 race schedule in 1981. In 1981 Elliott Racing ran twelve races. Bill Elliott ran all twelve races (Daytona 500, Cola Cola 500, CRC Chemicals Rebel 500, Winston 500, World 600, Gabriel 400, Firecracker 400, Talladega 500, Champion Spark Plug 400, Southern 500, National 500, American 500 and Atlanta Journal 500).

It began as the No. 53 when George Elliott entered Don Tilley at the 1966 American 500 but retired with steering failure. The team didn't reappear until the 1971 Talladega 500 as the No. 94 and entered Harry Gailey finishing forty seven laps down. In 1973 the team reappeared as the 09 for Charles Barrett to drive for four races (Atlanta 500, Dixie 500, Winston 500, World 600). Jody Ridley drove the No. 09 for the American 500. In 1974 the 09 returned at the 1974 Talladega 500 for A.J. Reno but retired with steering failure. The team returned as the No. 52 because of a contractual reason for the 1977 Southern 500 with Bill Elliott driving. The team didn't return again until 1979 when Hamby Racing formed an alliance with Elliott Racing using the No. 17, with Bill Elliott driving (Champion Spark Plug 400 and Southern 500 under the Elliott Racing banner and Volunteer 500, Capital City 400 and American 500 under the Hamby Racing banner.)

George's father James was born in England and came to the United States as a child. Both George's parents died at a young age, leaving George an orphan at the age of two. George was raised by his maternal grandparents in Providence, Rhode Island. George attended public schools in Providence, where his skills at drawing became evident. At age 14, George lived at the North American Phalanx, a transcendental community at Red Bank, New Jersey. There he studied with a painting instructor, Professor Guilledeau. The following year he apprenticed with his uncle Nathaniel Monday, an engraver in New York City. George Whitaker worked in New York as an engraver until he was 31 years old. Whitaker married Sarah L. Hull, daughter of John and Lydia N. (Sherman) Hull, on May 27, 1863. They lived in the Fruit Hill section of North Providence, and were active in neighborhood improvement associations. They were members of the Church of the New Jerusalem on Trinity Square, in Providence. They had one daughter, Elizabeth Wood (Whitaker) Stiff. Career During his time working for his uncle the engraver in New York City, Whitaker became interested in painting. He began studying with painters of the Hudson River School. Whitaker was mentored by landscape artists George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant. His attention then turned to Europe, and went to study with Hungarian painter L√°szl√≥ Pa√°l in Paris. Whitaker was heavily influenced by Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and the Barbizon school in France. Whitaker's fondness for his art was such that he was quoted as saying he would \\"rather paint than eat.\\" =The Providence art scene= Whitaker returned to settle in Providence in 1871, where he joined with Edward Mitchell Bannister and Charles Walter Stetson. He shared space with Sydney Burleigh in Burleigh's Fleur-de-lys Studios. Whitaker was also a regular attendee at the Sunday evening drawing-room gatherings held by Sarah Helen Whitman. Whitaker is important for his influence in the Providence art community. He was active in supporting artists and art in Rhode Island. He wrote for the A.E. Society, a club for professional men which he organized. and actively offered art critique, even long after leaving the RISD faculty. In 1878, Whitaker was instrumental in founding the Providence Art Club. He was also a founder of the Providence Water Color Club. Whitaker played a prominent role in the 1877 founding of the Rhode Island School of Design, and was its first instructor of oil painting. Portrait of the artist in later life =Works= Whitaker's typical canvas depicted a meadowland near a forest, with a roadway winding over a hill. The skies tend to have white fleecy cumulus clouds. In the middle distance is often a twisted old oak tree. It might feature a shepherd with a flock of sheep. Whitaker was a devotee of the Barbizon School throughout his life. Rather than depict nature as a background, they elevated natural scenes to be the subject of the artwork, with an overall tone of colored atmosphere or mist. In later life, Whitaker was not a fan of the more modern art movements coming out of Europe; for example, he considered Futurism a detrimental fad. In September 1887, Whitaker delivered a public lecture in which he recounted his search for the birthplace of fellow Rhode Island painter Gilbert Stuart. =Politics= Whitaker was an active Democrat, working to reform Providence's corrupt Republican party. He was a candidate for Senate several times, but never managed to achieve office. He volunteered on the local level for the Fruit Hill Volunteer Fire Department, and the Park Fund. Death and burial Whitaker died March 6, 1916 in Providence. He is buried at Swan Point Cemetery. Influence and legacy Whitaker exhibited at the National Academy in 1867 and 1869 and the Boston Art Club throughout the 1880s. His work is in the permanent collections at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Providence Art Club, Rhode Island Historical Society, and Kresge Art Museum at Michigan State University. He was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2019, the Gilbert Stuart Birthplace and Museum held a retrospective of Whitaker's work titled \\"The Mind‚Äôs Eye: The Art and Influence of George W.

The local Byzantine commander, Oiniates, successfully defended the city and destroyed a large part of the besieging force. Background In the 820s, two events, the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Sicily and the establishment of the Emirate of Crete, altered the balance of power between the Byzantine Empire and the Arabs in the Mediterranean. The former soon led to the establishment of Muslim bases on the Italian peninsula, while the loss of Crete was particularly important, as it opened the Aegean Sea to constant Muslim raiding. Apart from the raids of the Cretan Saracens, the Abbasid caliphs also took care to strengthen their forces in the Cilician frontier districts, and Tarsos became a major base for land and seaborne attacks against Byzantine territory. This was especially the case during the tenure of Yazaman al-Khadim as governor of Tarsos in 882‚Äì891. Siege of Euripos Shortly after defeating a major Byzantine attack against him in 883, Yazaman assembled his forces for a major raid against the Byzantine provinces of Greece. According to the 11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes, Yazaman's fleet comprised thirty koumbaria (large warships designed for war as well as freight), and launched an attack on the city of Euripos (the Byzantine name for Chalcis, located on the Euripus Strait between continental Central Greece and the island of Euboea). Emperor Basil I the Macedonian had received intelligence of Yazaman's intentions, however, and the governor of the local Theme of Hellas, a certain Oineiates, was well prepared to meet the attack, having assembled the troops of his province, repaired the walls and installed stone-throwing catapults on them. Skylitzes reports that the Tarsians launched successive attacks on the city, but they were repelled by the defenders \\"with their machines for hurling stones, missiles and darts‚Äîto say nothing of stones thrown from the walls by hand\\", as well as by sorties of their own ships, equipped with Greek fire, which sunk several Arab vessels. At long last, Yazaman placed a great shield before the lines of his troops, filled it with gold and promised to award it along with a hundred maidens to the first of his men who scaled the wall. When the besieged saw this, they understood that the final attack was imminent, and so, shouting to encourage each other, they launched a sortie of their own. The attack was successful, killing many of the besiegers and putting the rest to flight. Skylitzes reports that Yazaman too fell \\"at the first encounter\\", but this is clearly an error or a confusion, as al-Tabari records that he launched further raids against Byzantium in 886 and in 888, and was killed in 891 during his siege of the Byzantine fortress of Salandu. Aftermath Despite this Byzantine success, the Saracen raids continued unabated, and reached their climax in the early 10th century with the activities of Leo of Tripoli and Damian of Tarsus, culminating in the Sack of Thessalonica, the Byzantine Empire's second city, in 904. It was only after the 920s that the Byzantines began taking the upper hand, ending in the recovery of Crete, Cyprus, and finally Tarsos and Cilicia, in the 960s under Nikephoros Phokas.

DFK Anthem Contest: Music is a large component of Dance for Kindness. It also has the most amazing power to uplift, inspire and unite. In the summer of 2014, LVI Founder, Orly Wahba, had an idea to create an original song for Dance for Kindness. She reached out to four artists and asked them to come up with an original song that embodies the purpose of Dance for Kindness. Once the songs were submitted, it was left in the hands of the DFK Group Leaders to vote as to which song would be the official DFK2014 anthem. Votes were cast and Charles Preston's song, Revolution of Love was chosen as the first original DFK anthem. Starting in 2015, LVI opened up this opportunity to any and all musicians from around the globe to submit a demo that would be voted on by the public. LVI works with music industry professionals to produce the song to be heard worldwide on the day of Dance for Kindness. * 2014 DFK Anthem Winner: Charles Preston, Revolution of Love * 2015 DFK Anthem Winner: Yaakov Feldstein, More Light\\"Life Vest Inside  DFK Anthem\\", Life Vest Inside, Retrieved January 9, 2016.

Once open it will replace the existing Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport as the city's main airport. It is being built on of reclaimed land off the coast of Dalian. Expected to open sometime in 2020 or possibly later, it is set to become the world's largest offshore airport. Background Dalian is currently served by Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport, which has been used for both military and commercial flights since 1924 when Dalian was Japan's leased territory. As air traffic skyrocketed, the airport was expanded four times, in 1992, 1993, 2005, and 2011, and served more than 13 million passengers in 2012, ranking 15th in China. Because of the expansion of the city of Dalian, the airport is now surrounded by built-up urban area and has no more room to grow even though it is expected to reach its capacity in 2016. As a result, the authorities launched the new Jinzhouwan Airport project, which was included in the 12th national five-year plan in 2011. Construction The airport project was officially announced in 2012, but construction had already begun in April 2011. It is being built on of reclaimed land in , off the coast of Dalian, and is set to become the world's largest offshore airport. It is designed to handle the Airbus A380, the largest passenger jet, and is projected to cost 26.3 billion yuan (US$4.3 billion) to build. While the airport was expected to open in 2018, it has been delayed with no updated schedule. It will become China's first airport built on an artificial island. In 2014, Chinese media reported that the airport had not received the necessary approval from the national government, even though construction had already begun three years prior to the announcement. Some experts criticized its cost, warning that the cost of constructing and maintaining runways on reclaimed land could be 20 times more than inland airports. Facilities The airport is being built in two stages. The first stage comprises a terminal building and two runways, and is designed to handle 31 million passengers and 650,000 tons of cargo per year. Two more runways will be built in the second phase (class 4F), and once completed the airport will have the capacity to handle 70 million passengers a year, as well as 1 million tons of cargo each year.

The confusion is probably explained by the fact that Sir William Wilde had a natural son called Dr Henry Wilson.An Assembly of Irish Surgeons: Lives of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in the 20th Century by J. B. Lyons (Dublin: Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and The Glendale Press, 1983, pp. 141‚Äì147) He was educated at Mountjoy School (now merged to form part of Mount Temple Comprehensive School) and Trinity College, Dublin.

His eldest son, Anthony Babington Wilson, is a former business executive and artist and author.The Irish Independent, 8 February 1956 Wilson was subject to legal repercussions in 1942 when he was found to be hindering the arrest of a person liable to internment during the neutrality of the Irish Free State in the Second World War. He was part of a group that assisted British servicemen stranded in Ireland to escape across the border to Belfast. He was fined ¬£200 and sentenced to 12 months in prison, which was subsequently suspended on the agreement of a personal bail of ¬£500. His barrister was JA Costello, who later became Taoiseach. Wilson died suddenly of a heart attack on 6 November 1969 when staying at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. Publications *Victorian Doctor: the Life of Sir William Wilde (London: Methuen & Co.

Velazquez props herself up with a walking stick or cane, and bears a wooden cross in her extended right hand, playfully banishing the Duchess. Both figures wear white dresses; the duchess with black lace and bodice. The painting is composed of mainly white and black hues applied in broad brush strokes, while the dresses are outlined in touches of livid yellow. The figures are set against a flat, black background which isolates the moment and removes any context. The Duchess of Alba and la Beata is considered to form part of Goya's \\"caprichos\\", and was painted shortly after he fell deaf. It is signed \\"Goya in 1795\\" in the lower right corner. It is in the collection of the Museo del Prado, Madrid, having been acquired from a private collection. Goya portrayed Mar√≠a Cayetana de Silva a number of other times, notably The White Duchess of the same year and the 1797 Portrait of the Duchess of Alba. NotesSources * Connell, Evan S.

Biography  Gorokhov and his children in 1909 He was born to the family of a former serf.Biographical notes @ RusArtNet. At an early age, he began to draw scenes from nature but was needed on the farm and was not allowed to pursue his interests. Word of his talent spread, however, and attracted the attention of a local landowner, Vladimir von Meck, son of the businessman, Karl von Meck. He showed some of Ivan's drawings to one of his guests, Nikolai Rubinstein, who joined with Von Meck to provide financial support so Ivan could attend the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. He began auditing classes there in 1874 and became a full student in 1880. His instructors included Illarion Pryanishnikov and Vladimir Makovsky. In 1886, he graduated with the title of \\"Artist\\" and a silver medal for his work \\"Recuperating\\".Biographical notes @ ArtRu. He considered continuing at the Imperial Academy of Arts but, on the advice of Konstantin Makovsky, chose to begin his career immediately. However, despite the support of influential people, he was unable to get enough work to afford living in Moscow and returned to his native village, but found it just as hard to establish himself there. It was necessary to travel to Moscow to purchase art supplies or show his works, and this was often too expensive. This was eased somewhat when he became associated with the Peredvizhniki in 1893 and received positive reviews at their 21st exhibition. Some of his works were purchased by members of the Imperial family. Following a fire in 1897, he moved to Mozhaysk, a market and trading center. From 1905 to 1930, he was a drawing teacher at the —Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —É—á–∏–ª–∏—â–µ (Realschule) there. After the October Revolution he turned to painting works of Socialist Realism, including portraits of Lenin and Lunacharsky and scenes from the Civil War. Only a handful of these later works survived, due to the general destruction experienced in the Mozhaysk area from 1941 to 1942, during the German invasion. Most of his paintings are in private collections.

They belonged to padmanayaka velama community.https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=11771&recCount;=25&recPointer;=0&bibId;=20725023  History  The Recherla Nayakas are believed to have established their first base at Amanugallu. When their chief Singama Nayaka was assassinated by rivals, his son Anapota Nayaka blamed Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka as the orchestrator and marched on Warangal. In a battle fought at Bhimavaram in 1368, Kapaya Nayaka was killed and the Recherlas got control of Telangana. Anapota Nayaka later claimed, in an inscription issued in 1369, that his grandfather, Dachaya, had served as a chief under the Kakatiyas and that Prataparudra II conferred on him the title Pandya-raja-gaja-kesari (a lion against the Pandya elephants). The Recherla Nayakas built two fortified towns at Rachakonda and Devarakonda in the Nalgonda district. The Recherlas had as their rivals the Reddy dynasty in the coastal Andhra region. They were initially allied with the Bahmani sultanate, following the same terms of agreement as reached by the Musunuri Nayakas in 1364, whereas the Reddys were allied to the Vijayanagara Empire. Following a split among the Reddy clan, the Kondavidu Reddys switched their allegiance to the Bahmanis and the Recherlas aligned themselves with the Vijayanagara. A major battle ensued at Panagal, Nalgonda district in 1419 in which the coalition of the Vijayanagara, Recherlas and Rajahmundry Reddys was victorious. However, the change of allegiance by Recherlas led to attacks by the Bahmani sultanate in the 1420s, who captured Warangal as well as Rachakonda by 1435. Thereafter, the Recherla chiefs remained small players scattered throughout Telangana.

The location of the ISCO, the ISCO-radius (r_{\\\\mathrm{isco}}), depends on the angular momentum (spin) of the central object. The ISCO plays an important role in black hole accretion disks since it marks the inner edge of the disk. For a non-spinning massive object, where the gravitational field can be expressed with the Schwarzschild metric, the ISCO is located at, :r_{\\\\mathrm{isco}} = \\\\frac{6 \\\\, GM}{c^2}=3 R_S, where R_S is the Schwarzschild radius of the massive object with mass M . Thus, even for a non-spinning object, the ISCO radius is only three times the Schwarzschild radius, R_S , suggesting that only black holes and neutron stars have innermost stable circular orbits outside of their surfaces. As the angular momentum of the central object increases, r_{\\\\mathrm{isco}} decreases. Circular orbits are still possible between the ISCO and the photon sphere, but they are unstable. The photon sphere has a radius of :r = \\\\frac{3 \\\\, GM}{c^2} = \\\\frac{3 R_S}{2}. For a massless test particle like a photon, the only possible circular orbit is exactly at the photon sphere, and is unstable. Inside the photon sphere, no circular orbits exist. Rotating black holes The case for rotating black holes is somewhat more complicated. The equatorial ISCO in the Kerr metric depends on whether the orbit is prograde (negative sign below) or retrograde (positive sign): :r_{\\\\mathrm{isco}} = \\\\frac{GM}{c^2} \\\\left( 3 + Z_2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(3-Z_1)(3+Z_1+2Z_2)} \\\\right) where :Z_1 = 1 + \\\\sqrt[3]{1-x^2} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{1+x} + \\\\sqrt[3]{1-x} \\\\right) :Z_2 = \\\\sqrt{3x^2 + Z_1^2} with x=a/M as the rotation parameter. As the rotation rate of the black hole increases the retrograde ISCO increases towards 9GM/c^2 (4.5 times the a=0 horizon radius) while the prograde ISCO decreases towards the horizon radius and appears to merge with it for an extremal black hole (however, this later merger is illusory and an artefact of using Boyer- Lindquist coordinates ). If the particle is also spinning there is a further split in ISCO radius depending on whether the spin is aligned with or against the black hole rotation. ReferencesExternal links * Leo C.

Alice was the largest vessel built above Willamette Falls and was considered in its day to be the \\"Queen of the River\\". This steamer was rebuilt after near-destruction in a fire at Oregon City, Oregon in May 1873. In 1876, it was withdrawn from the upper Willamette River and transferred to the Columbia River, where it was worked as a towboat moving ocean-going ships to and from Portland and Astoria, Oregon, near the mouth of the Columbia River. Construction Alice was built at Canemah, Oregon in 1871 Reports that Alice was built in 1873 are incorrect. Alice was rebuilt in 1873 following a fire in early May of that year, which may provide the origin of this error. Canemah, Oregon was a settlement established in the 1850s on the east side of the river above Willamette Falls, not far from present day Oregon City. Many steamboats were built and Canemah before the Alice, but as the town declined in the 1870s, only three were constructed there, Alice, Shoo Fly, and McMinnvillle. No steamers were built after the 1870s. The official merchant vessel registry number for Alice was 105098. The gross tonnage (a measure of size, not weight) for the vessel was 457.16 in 1874. In 1886, Alice's registered dimensions were 150.5 long, 25.5 beam (width) and 6-foot depth of hold; gross tonnage 457.16, registered tonnage 334.22. When built, Alice was considered a prestige vessel, and as described as the Queen of the River. In 1889, a nostalgic steamboat captain was reported to have described Alice as follows: Engines The original engines in Alice had been installed first in the steamer E.D. Baker, and when that vessel was dismantled, in the sternwheeler Reliance. These were twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of . Sale to Ben Holladay On September 1, 1871, it was reported that Alice would make its trial trip the next day. However, on September 6, 1871, by vote of its shareholders, the People's Transportation Company was dissolved and all of its assets, including the not yet complete steamer Alice, were sold to a company organized by the prominent businessman Ben Holladay. It was not until February 2, 1872, that Alice was reported to be complete and ready for service. Alice was reported to be the largest boat on the upper Willamette River, and of the same size and model as the E.N. Cooke. The cabin was described as \\"small, yet plenty large enough for the demands of travel.\\" Alice was finished with staterooms instead of the older style berths. The trial trip of the new steamer, upriver from Rock Island, was reported to have been made in the last week of January 1872. On February 9, 1872, Alice was reported to be ready to make its first commercial run up the Willamette River on the following Monday, February 12, 1872. Alice was expected to be the fastest steamer ever to run on the upper Willamette. On Tuesday, February 13, 1872, Alice reached Albany, Oregon. On Sunday, February 9, 1873, Alice arrived at the boat basin at Oregon City with 203 tons of wheat on board, which was said to have been the largest load ever brought to the basin by a single boat. Almost a year later, on the Wednesday before January 30, 1874, Alice arrived at the boat basin with 245 tons of wheat on board. Rivalry with Gov. Grover Gov. Grover, rival sternwheeler to Alice, shown in the then newly completed Willamette Locks, March 1873. One of the rival vessels of Alice on the upper Willamette in early 1873 was the sternwheeler Gov. Grover, owned by the Willamette River Transportation Company, of which Bernard Goldsmith was president. On Thursday, March 27, 1873, there were rumors that there would be a race between the two boats. There was not an actually test of which steamer was capable of the faster speed. The Grover left the newly completed Willamette Locks at 8:30 a.m., stopped at all the landings along the way, and arrived at Salem at 5:00 p.m. with 33 passengers. After a short stop in Salem, Grover went on to Corvallis. Alice departed the Oregon City boat basin at 9:56 a.m. the same day, and arrived at Salem a few minutes after Grover, with 15 passengers and ten tons of through freight. Alice loaded 8 tons of freight, and departed for Corvallis about one and a half minutes after the Grover. According to a newspaper report from Salem, \\"they were both making the water fly when they passed out of sight.\\" Near destruction by fire The boat basin at Oregon City in 1867. The steamers Alice and Shoo Fly were moored near here in 1873 when both vessels were nearly destroyed by fire. On the night of Friday, May 2, 1873, the steamers Alice and Shoo Fly were heavily damaged by fire at Oregon City. The loss, estimated at $20,000, was believed by some to have been the work of an arsonist. The steamers were both moored within a few feet of the Larocque & Co. flour mills, which the Oregon City fire department saved from destruction. The Morning Oregonian had a somewhat different report, according to which the fire started about 10:00 p.m. on the Saturday before May 5, 1873, on board the Shoo Fly, which, shortly after a light was observed coming from the boiler area, burst into flames. Within five minutes after the fire was first noticed, it had spread to the Alice. Both boats were nearly consumed within ten minutes. The steamers had been moored next to the Imperial Mill building, and it had been in danger catching fire as well, but was saved by a shift of wind and the work of the Oregon City fire department. Both Alice and Shoo Fly were good running condition, although Shoo Fly was said to be rather old and had perhaps a year left of its useful life at the time of the fire. The boilers and engines on both boats were undamaged, but the connecting gear, pipes and similar items were either melted or made using by having been warped by the intense heat. The hull, parts of the deck and the stern-wheel of Alice were saved, and the steamer would probably be rebuilt. The estimated loss was between $18,000 and $20,000. There was no insurance. Some people thought the fire had originated when someone dropped cigar ash or something similar into inflammable materials on board Shoo Fly, such as pulu dust, with the fire festering slowly for some time before it was noticed, by which time it was too late. The possibility of arson was discounted, because it was thought it would not have been perpetrated at so early in the evening. On May 9, 1873, it was reported that the Alice was to be rebuilt. By July 25, 1873, the reconstruction had begun, and the work was expected to be complete by the fall shipping season. The steamer was still not complete on September 26, 1873, but the lower cabin frame had been placed in position, and the boat was reportedly going to be ready for the winter shipping season. On September 9, 1873, the Oregon Steamship Company, Ben Holladay, President, and L.T. Barin, Secretary of the Board, presented two gold mounted trumpets and a certificate of the company's appreciation to the Oregon City Fire Department for its services in preventing the steamers Alice and Shoo Fly from being completely destroyed on the night of the fire. Returned to service Advertisement for Willamette River steamers, including Alice, August 31, 1874. By early November the reconstruction of both Alice and Shoo Fly was nearly complete. Alice was in the boat basin at Oregon City, and steam had been raised in the boiler on Tuesday, November 4, 1873. Shoo Fly, also nearly complete, was being rebuilt at the sawmill downriver from Oregon City. On Saturday, November 15, 1873, Alice was taken on its trial trip following reconstruction, running from Oregon City to Boone's Ferry, on the upper Willamette. The boat ran well, but full steam was not carried, so the top speed of the vessel could not be evaluated on the trial run. Captain Milo Bell was in charge on the trial trip, and the mechanical department was headed by Reuben Smith, the company's chief engineer. The reconstructed Alice was a significant improvement over the original steamer. The cabin structure, called the \\"house\\" was completely new. Additional space was left on the foredeck, so that there was more room for the crew to move on the deck, and also to stack additional freight. The upper deck was divided into a smoking room, staterooms, and a cabin for ladies and another cabin for gentlemen. The upper deck had been extended over the wheel, to prevent it from splashing water onto the cabin deck. This had been the idea of Mr. Biles. The upholstery and the painting was still being done at the time of the November trial trip, and there was still some cabin work being done. =Complaint from riverside property owner= In January 1874, an Albany, Oregon newspaper, the State Rights Democrat, published a complaint by Mr. Preston Bowman, of Spring Hill (a little down river from Independence), that he had kept tame geese, and the crew of the Alice had recently been amusing themselves by shooting the geese as the steamer passed by his place up and down the river. =Wheat transport= In February 1874, three steamers, Alice, Fannie Patton, and Albany, were all engaged in transporting wheat from Eugene City and other points downriver to Salem Flour Mills, owned by Robert Crouch Kinney (1813-1875) and company. Most of the wheat had already been sold, and was intended to be shipped to Europe. The farmers in the upper Willamette Valley were hoping to get prices of $1 a bushel for their wheat. =Transfer to lower Willamette River= On Thursday, July 23, 1874, Alice, which then belonged to the Oregon Steamship Company, was taken through the newly completed Willamette Falls Locks to the lower Willamette River. In July 1874, it was reported that Alice was to be used as a private boat of the prominent businessman Ben Holladay. According to an 1889 report, this had in fact occurred. =Return to upper river service= By August 31, 1874, Alice had been returned to the upper Willamette, running from Oregon City to Corvallis and way landings on Mondays and Thursdays, making connections at Oregon City with the steamer Welcome to Portland. Fare to Corvallis was $1.00. Freight to Corvallis and all intermediate points was $1.00 per ton, exclusive of drayage, that is, local transport charges. Alice continued to be advertised as being on this route until February 24, 1875. =Numerous landings on route= There were many landings along the Willamette river in the 1870s. In 1875, Alice made a trip from Oregon City to Albany and stopped at 33 landings along the way. This was a distance of 92 miles. Snagged On Tuesday, February 2, 1875, Alice hit a snag near Wheatland, and sustained damage so severe that it was necessary to beach the steamer. Early reports were not able to give the extent of the damage. Some details of the incident were reported to the States Rights Democrat, by their travelling agent, J.M. Marks, and they were that the Alice had been proceeding on the river at a good rate of speed, when about a mile and a half downriver from Buena Vista, the steamer hit a snag, which shoved a good-sized hole into its hull just under the boiler. Buena Vista was 21 miles upriver from Salem. The captain turned Alice around and ran it onto a bar in the river, otherwise i would have sunk, as there was already 23 inches of water in the boat just four minutes after the snagging. The passengers had to wait on board the stranded steamer for an hour until the Willamette Chief came upon the scene and took them on board. Other steamers came up on Wednesday to assist in the salvage. Other details, some augmenting, and some conflicting with the State Rights Democrat, were reported in Salem's Willamette Farmer the next day. Captain Bell had been in command. The accident happened about one mile upriver from Buena Vista, and the snag had been newly lodged in the river. Captain Bell beached the steamer on a level bar about 200 yards from the snag strike, where the 150 tons of freight, taken on at Corvallis and Eugene, would be safe. The afternoon of the wreck, the purser, Mr. J.W. McCully, went downriver to Salem, where he telegraphed to the company Oregon City to send up nails, lumber and carpenters to repair the Alice, and another steamer, either the Fannie Patton or the E.N. Cooke to come up and take off the cargo. Alice was brought down to the company's boat basin on Monday February 8, 1875, where the damage turned out to be worse than it was first thought to have been. Alice was back in operation by February 26, 1875, when than morning it picked up 5,500 feet of maple lumber from Capital Mills, at Salem, part of a 40,000-foot lot being sawn for the Oregon Furniture Co. of Portland. New engines In July 1875 two new engines were scheduled to be cast for Alice at the Willamette Iron Works, with each engine having a cylinder bore of 17 inches and a piston stroke of six feet. These engines, which were larger than the boat's original ones, were installed during the low water period in the fall of 1875, and the steamer was ready to resume operations in November of that year. 1876 schedule on upper river In January 1876, the Oregon Steamship Company. W.H. McCully, agent, had placed Alice on a schedule of running from Salem to Corvallis and way landings on Mondays and Thursdays of each week. On the return from Corvallis, Alice departed for Portland in the mornings. Alice alternated on this schedule with the O.S.S. Co. steamer Bonanza, which ran for Corvallis on Tuesdays and Fridays. O.S.S. Co. advertised this schedule until April 1876. 1876 transfer to lower river On May 6, 1876, the Salem Statesman reported that \\"'a number of citizens on the Upper Willamette, upon learning that the steamer Alice is to be laid up, declare that if Capt. Bell and Doc McCully are not furnished with a boat, they, the people will build one for them.\\" Sale to Oregon Steam Navigation Company In late May 1876, Alice, together with all the other steamers and property of the Oregon Steamship Company, was sold to the Willamette Transportation and Locks Company, a subsidiary of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. With this purchase, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company now controlled all the steamboats on both the Columbia and the Willamette riveres, except for two, City of Salem and Ohio. In August 1876, Alice, under the control of the Willamette River Transportation and Locks Company, was brought downriver to Portland, to take the place of the Gov. Grover, which was going to the boneyard for repairs. Towing work In October 1876 Alice was engaged in towing vessels up and down the Columbia River, under Capt. Billy Smith. Among numerous reported tows: on the afternoon of September 12, 1877, Alice brought the ship Greta, a British vessel, alongside the wharf of the Wallamet River Canal and Locks Company, in Astoria, Oregon, where the Greta would load additional cargo before departing for Europe. On Sunday, January 9, 1881, the steamer Alice, with Captain Strang piloting towed the Orient to Knappton, W.T. Accidents On Saturday afternoon, December 15, 1877, George W. Weldon, a Portland hotel runner, was drowned at Swan Island; while trying to board the steamer Alice from a skiff, the skiff overturned and Weldon was thrown into the river. Disposition OSN steamboat boneyard, Portland, Oregon, in 1892. By early June 1889, Alice had been at the boneyard for about three years, when the boat sank, with the water coming up a little over its decks. The \\"boneyard\\" was the name for a place alongside the Willamette River which had been established by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company for the storage and dismantling of steamers that were no longer in service. Steamboats were also built, repaired, and reconstructed at the boneyard. Alice had been used to pump water out of barges and other hulls at the boneyard. The machinery was reported to be \\"still good and in fair order.\\" Alice was scheduled to be raised on June 5, 1889, and possibly a new hull would be built under the boat.

Life He was born at Brussels into a musical family. His father was Maurice Art√¥t (1772‚Äì1829), first horn-player at the theatre in Brussels. His mother was Jeanne Catherine Borremans, from the musical family of Charles and Joseph Borremans.Information about his mother is from his birth certificate, available online at the Brabant, Belgium civil registration, 1582-1914. Earlier sources, such as the Alexis Chitty's Grove article (1900), give his mother as Theresa Eva, daughter of Adam and cousin of Ferdinand Ries. His father was born with the surname Montagny or Montaguey, but had adopted the professional name Art√¥t, which was preserved by all his children. Alexandre's older brother was the horn player , who later became the father of soprano D√©sir√©e Art√¥t. Alexandre received instruction in music and on the violin from his father, and at the age of seven played at the theatre a concerto of Giovanni Battista Viotti. He received further instruction from , principal first violin at the theatre, and afterwards at the Paris Conservatory from Rodolphe and , and in 1827 and 1828 he obtained the second and first violin prizes respectively. According to F√©tis, Art√¥t then played in concerts in Brussels and London with the greatest success, and became for a time player in the various Parisian orchestras. He became famous as a soloist, and made tours through Belgium, Holland, Italy, Germany, etc. On 3 June 1839, the same occasion that the singer Giovanni Matteo Mario first appeared in England, Art√¥t played at the Philharmonic a fantasia of his own for violin and orchestra, and was well received, rather on account of the delicacy and feeling of his playing and his remarkable execution, than from his tone, which was very small.Athenaeum, June 8, 1880. As cited in We do not find that he played at any other public concert, and this is borne out by a letter of 6 August the same year from Berlioz to Liszt, wherein details are given concerning musical taste in London at the time, received from , who had just returned from there, and whose mutual conversation he reports at length: \\"I arrived too late, and it is the same with Art√¥t, who, despite his success at the Philharmonic, despite the incontestable beauty of his talent, has a tedious time of it.\\"Berlioz, Correspondence In√©dite (1879), p. 184. As cited in In 1843 he went to America, Cuba, etc., on a concert tour with Laure Cinti-Damoreau, and while there he received the first symptoms of a lung disease. He never recovered, but died July 20, 1845, at Ville d'Avray near Paris. Upon his death, the Athenaeum noted, \\"He was, perhaps, the most finished and the most elegant of all the Rubini school of players; one of the handsomest men in our recollection; and much beloved, we are told, among his comrades for his gentleness and amiability.\\" Athenaeum, August 2, 1845. As cited in Compositions Art√¥t's compositions for the violin include a concerto in A minor, various fantasias and airs with variations with piano or orchestral accompaniment, and, in manuscript, string quartets, and a quintet for piano and strings.

He served in the Continental Army in the American Revolution and the American forces in the War of 1812. He is buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery, Gloversville, New York. Early life Nicholas Stoner was born in Maryland in 1762 or 1763, the son of German immigrant Henry Stoner and Catherine Barnes. During his childhood the family moved to New York City, where his uncle, John Binkus,During the Revolution Binkus became an officer in Loyalist General Oliver De Lancey's Brigade paid for his schooling. After a few years the family again moved, to a frontier community called \\"Fonda's Bush\\" (now Broadalbin, Fulton County, New York), east of Johnstown and north of Amsterdam, New York. Revolutionary War In 1777 Stoner enlisted as a fifer in the Patriot forces in Colonel James Livingston's battalion of the New York Line under Captain Timothy Hughes. His father and younger brother, John, served in the same regiment. In August 1777 the unit accompanied General Benedict Arnold in the relief of Fort Stanwix. In the fall of that year they fought in the Battles of Saratoga. Stoner accompanied General Arnold in the attack on the Hessian camp in which Arnold was wounded, and Stoner was also wounded on the right side of his head and his ear by fragments of the skull of a fellow soldier killed by a cannonball. Following his recovery he served with his unit in Rhode Island, where his father was wounded and Nicholas captured, but later freed. In 1780 it was said that he was fifer of the guard that conducted convicted British spy Major John Andr√© to the gallows, and in 1781 he was at Yorktown for the British surrender. In 1781 Nicholas' father was released from the army and settled on a farm formerly belonging to Loyalist Col. John Butler at Tribes Hill, New York. Here, in 1782, he was surprised, killed, and scalped by a raiding party of Indians. In 1783 Nicholas accompanied Col. Marinus Willett to New York City upon its evacuation by the British. Post war After the war Stoner returned to Johnstown and married his old flame, Anna Mason, now a young widow with a baby daughter. In 1781, during Stoner's long absence, Mason had married William Scarborough. Later that year Scarborough was killed by Captain James McDonald in a British raiding party led by Major John Ross, in what is known as the Battle of Johnstown.Stoner says that McDonald and Scarborough had been neighbors before the war, and the killing may have been the result of a personal quarrel. In addition to Scarborough's daughter Mary (b.1782), Nicholas and Anna had six children together ‚Äî four sons: John (b.1789), Jeremiah (b.1794), Henry (b.1796), and Obediah (b.1801), and two daughters: Mary, and Catherine (b.1802). The family first lived near Johnson Hall, and then moved to Scotch Bush, now in the town of Florida in Montgomery County. Stoner served for a time as deputy sheriff, and also filled various other offices in the town. During this time, too, he became noted as a hunter and trapper, primarily in the area along the Sacandaga River. One time he engaged in a drunken brawl in De Fonclaire's Tavern in Johnstown, which was frequented by both Canadian and American trappers. One of the Canadian Indians, hearing the name of Stoner, pulled out his scalping knife and boasted of the nine notches indicating scalps taken during the Revolution. He pointed to one, cut deeper than the others, and said that this \\"was the scalp of old Stoner!\\" (Nicholas' father) Hearing this Stoner grabbed a red-hot andiron and threw it at the Indian, yelling \\"You never will scalp another one!\\" The iron burned a brand across the Indian's neck and knocked him unconscious, at the cost of severe burns to Stoner's own hand. It is not known what became of the injured Native, although he is believed to have died of his injury on the way back to Canada. Stoner was arrested and jailed, but was freed by a mob of fellow Revolutionary War veterans, and was never brought to trial. Stoner was married to Anna Mason for over forty years. After her death in 1824 he lived for fifteen or twenty years with a woman named Polly Phye, whose husband had abandoned her. After Polly's death, Stoner married a much younger widow, Hannah (Houghtaling) Frank, in 1840, and resided in Caroga, New York. War of 1812 At the outbreak of the War of 1812 both Stoner brothers enlisted‚ÄîJohn in 1812 and Nicholas in 1813. John died of illness at Sackets Harbor, New York. Nicholas enlisted in the 29th Regiment. In the spring he joined the rest of the army at Plattsburgh as a fife-major, and henceforth was titled \\"Major Stoner\\". In September 1814, he took part in the Battle of Plattsburgh, where a small American force repelled a vastly superior British force. Death Nicholas Stoner died at the age of 92 on November 24, 1853, in Newkirk's Mills (now Newkirk), in the town of Caroga. He was originally buried in Kingsborough Cemetery in Gloversville, which still has a plaque marking the site. His remains were later moved to Prospect Hill Cemetery in Gloversville. Legacy The Nick Stoner Municipal Golf Course in Caroga is named for Stoner and also exhibits a large statue of him. East Stoner Lake, West Stoner Lake, and Little Stoner Lake at the northern end of Caroga, as well as Nick Stoner Island in nearby Canada Lake, bear his name. The fight song of Gloversville High School was \\"Old Nick Stoner, the Man whose Praise we sing.\\" A liberty ship, , was launched in 1944.

He was the founder of the discipline of tribology, the science and engineering of interacting surfaces in relative motion. In 1966, Jost published a report which highlighted the cost of friction, wear and corrosion to the United Kingdom economy (1.1-1.4% of GDP). It was in this eponymous report that he coined the term tribology, which has now been widely adopted.  Education and career  Jost was educated at Liverpool Technical College and Manchester College of Technology. He began his career as an apprentice at Associated Metal Works, Glasgow. At 29, he became general manager of Trier Brothers, an international lubricants company, and he went on to serve as a director and chairman of several technology and engineering companies. He served on numerous industry councils, and until his death was president of the International Tribology Councilhttp://www.itctribology.net/ International Tribology Council and a life member of the council of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee.  Awards and recognition  The Royal Academy of Engineering noted that \\"there can hardly be another British engineer with more worldwide honours and decorations\\". He was appointed a CBE in 1969, and was also honoured by the heads of state of France, Germany, Poland, Austria and Japan, and in 1992 became the first honorary foreign member of the Russia Academy of Engineering. He held two honorary professorships and 11 honorary doctorates including, in January 2000, the first Millennium honorary science doctorate. He was an honorary fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and of the Institute of Materials. Shortly before his death, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering but he died before the Academy's AGM at which this was announced. He established The Peter Jost Charitable Foundation which promotes the advancement of public education in science and technology through teaching and research, particularly the increase of public knowledge in tribology.

It was mostly written by Bertilo Wennergren and is for ordinary Esperanto speakers who want to study Esperanto's grammar, word construction, writing and pronunciation. It does not use traditional grammatical terminology, which makes it easier to understand than traditional grammar textbooks. Examples of the terms used are \\"O-vorto\\" (O-word) instead of \\"substantivo\\" (noun, substantive) and \\"rolvorteto\\" (little role word) instead of \\"prepozicio\\" (preposition). These new grammatical terms are also more suitable to describe Esperanto than traditional terms. For example, using traditional terminology, the words \\"tiu\\" (that one), \\"amba≈≠\\" (both) and \\"ties\\" (that one's) would be adjectives, but they behave very differently than the adjectives ending in \\"a\\"; the word \\"A-vorto\\" (A-word) groups words that behave similarly together. PMEG is mainly a practical guide and not really a theoretical work for linguists, unlike the Plena Analiza Gramatiko (Complete Analytical Grammar), which was regarded as \\"the largest research project into Esperanto's grammar\\" until PMEG's publication. Since 1995 it has existed on the Internet. In 2006, the printed version, published by Esperanto-USA, became available for purchase, as well.

Plot Jason Wilkes becomes drawn to the Zero Matter in a sample of Jane Scott's body. After absorbing that small amount, Wilkes temporarily regains his physical body and discovers the location of Scott's. Peggy Carter and Edwin Jarvis attempt to steal Scott's body, hoping that the rest of the Zero Matter within it will restore Wilkes permanently, but arrive to see Whitney Frost taking the Zero Matter for herself, before convincing Calvin Chadwick to help her steal an atomic bomb from the Council so she can replicate the original discovery of Zero Matter. They seek help from Frost's ex-boyfriend Joseph Manfredi, a crime lord, who gives them men for the job in exchange for Chadwick's influence in the media. Carter, Jarvis, Daniel Sousa, and some Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) allies break into the Roxxon facility holding the bombs and disable them before Frost can reach them. Carter confronts Frost, but she escapes when Carter is impaled on a rebar.

It existed between 1974 and 1978, during the Spanish State and the early Spanish transition to democracy, which had banned all the political organizations other than those in the Movimiento Nacional. The party wasn't legalized until the 9 of April 1977. Ideology The party considered that Valencians were a \\"singular people\\", part of the cultural and national unity of the Catalan Countries. The PSPV defended confederalism as the best solution to the internal organization of Spain. History Its founders came from different left-wing currents, but the majority were members or had been close to the historic Valencian Socialist Party. The party experimented a significant growth in 1975, specially in Horta Nord, the stronghold of the PSPV. The party was legalized in April 1977, presenting a common candidacy with the People's Socialist Party called Socialist Unity. The coalition gained 1 MP and 1 senator in the 1977 elections, the first democratic ones since 1936. Due to the good results of the PSOE, that won in the Valencian Country, a sector in the PSPV defended joining that party. Finally, in 1978, the majority sector of the PSPV voted in favour of joining the Valencian federation of the PSOE, forming the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country-PSOE. The other sector decided to join other political movements, including the Communist Party of the Valencian Country and the Nationalist Party of the Valencian Country.

In 1858, Swan was sold, moved to the lower Willamette River, renamed Cowlitz, and placed on a route between Portland, Oregon the Cowlitz River. In 1868, Cowlitz was rebuilt, renamed Wenat, which was operated from 1868 to 1875 on the Willamette and Cowlitz rivers. In 1875, was transferred to Puget Sound, where it operated on several rivers flowing into the sound, including the Duwamish, the Puyallup, and the Skagit, before being converted into an unpowered barge in 1878. Construction Wenat was built, as Swan, on the Tualatin River by Silus E. \\"Si\\" Smith and George A. Pease in 1857, at a place called Moore's Mills, where a dam on the Tualatin was planned to be built. Moore's Mill, named after James M. Moore, was about three miles up the Tualatin River from Linn City, Oregon, which was on the west side of Willamette Falls. In July 1858, Swan was purchased by Charles Holman (d.1886), H.D. Huntington, and Oliff Olson of Monticello W.T. (now Longview), for a price of $7,500. According to one source, the sale occurred on completion of Swan. Swan was taken below Willamette Falls and, as of July 15, 1858, placed on the run from Portland to the Cowlitz River. Wenat was rebuilt in 1868 from the steamer Cowlitz at Portland, Oregon by Si Smith for the Willamette Steamboat Company. Dimensions Wenat was either 77 or 87 feet long, exclusive of the extension over the stern, called the fantail, on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The beam (width) was 18 feet, exclusive of the guards. The depth of hold was 4 feet. The official merchant vessel registry number was 80026. Another source gives slightly different dimensions: hull 76 feet long, 17 foot beam, 3.5 foot depth of hold. Engineering Wenat was driven by twin high-pressure steam engines, horizontally mounted, single cylinder, bore , stroke . Operations=Transfer to the Cowlitz River= Swan did not pay expenses and so it was sold and brought down over the rapids at the mouth of the Tualatin River and taken to Oregon City. At Oregon City the engines were taken out, and the boat was lowered down the ramp in the warehouse of the People's Transportation Company to the lower Willamette River. The engines were replaced, and the boat was taken to the Cowlitz River. Pumphrey Landing was the departure point for the overland stage to Olympia, W.T. In September 1857, Cowlitz, under Capt. Charles Holman, ran between Portland and Monticello, departing Portland mornings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8:00 a.m., and, on the return trip, leaving Monticello every morning on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, at 6:00 a.m. Oliff Olson worked as a deckhand, but later, after he was licensed, he became captain, taking the place of Holman. Captains Thayer and Kern succeeded Olson. In 1864, Cowlitz was leased to Monticello & Cowlitz Steamboat Co to take the place of the steamer Rescue, which was then running to the Cascades Rapids, on the Columbia Rivar. Two years after that, Cowlitz was taken off the Cowlitz river route, and placed on a run from Portland to the mouth of the Lewis River. Cowlitz departed Portland on Mondays and Wednesdays, and returned the following day. The Willamette Steamboat Company bought Cowlitz two years later. =Rebuilt as Wenat= In 1868, the Willamette Steamboat Company had Cowlitz rebuilt in Portland by Si Smith, the same man who had built the vessel on the Tualatin river eleven years previously. The hull length was increased by more than ten feet, and the engines were replaced with the machinery from the steamer Vancouver, a sidewheeler built in 1857 at MIlwaukie, Oregon. The Willamette Steamboat company renamed the vessel Wenat. In June 1868, the Willamette Steamboat Company operated Wenat, under Captain A. Boone, on regular trips between Portland and Oregon City, leaving Oregon City in the morning and Portland at 3:00 p.m. At Oregon City, Wenat made a connection with the steamer Ann ex Lewiston, which, on Mondays Wednesdays, and Friday, ran for Dayton, Lafayette, and McMinnville and waypoints, on the Yamhill River. On Saturday of each week, Ann ran for Fairfield and Wheatland, on the upper Willamette River. N. Haun was the president of the Willamette Steamboat Company at this time. As of September 17, 1868, Wenat was running for the Willamette Steamboat Company on a route from Portland to Oregon City, Oregon. In September 1868, Wenat departed Portland daily except Sundays to Oregon City at 6:30 a.m. Once at Oregon City, Wenat connected with the steamer Success, which, Mondays and Thursdays of each week, ran for Salem, Albany, Corvallis, and waypoints. The steamer Ann ex Lewiston, ran on the same days from Oregon City for Dayton, on the Yamhill River. Wenat departed Oregon City at 1:00 a.m. on the return trip to Portland, except on Wednesdays and Saturdays, when Wenat would await the arrival of the steamers Success and Ann from upriver points. in December 1868, there were four steamers running in opposition to the People's Transportation Company on the Willamette River. Wenat and Carrie ran between Portland and Oregon City. The Success and the Ann ex Lewiston ran between Canemah and Eugene City. Each of the four opposition boats was owned by a separate company, but there were rumors, in December 1868, that they would be consolidated into a single organization to oppose the near-monopoly of the P.T. Company. =Sheriff's sale to Joseph Kellogg= On the morning of April 30, 1869, Wenat was scheduled to be sold by Sheriff Zeiber to satisfy debts which had accumulated against the steamer. The steamer was purchased by Joseph Kellogg, who had the vessel repaired and refitted in preparation for bringing it back into service. Kellogg paid $3,000 for the boat. As of May 5, 1870, Wenat was running from Portland to Monticello, W.T. on alternate days with the steamer Rescue, thus establishing daily steamboat service between the two cities. Passenger fare on this route was fifty cents. Freight rates were a dollar per ton The U.S. mail to Olympia was to be taken over this route starting July 1, 1870. J.N. Fisher took over as master, and he in turn was succeeded by Capt. W.H. Smith, who ran the vessel for several years. Captain Kellogg operated Wenat on the Columbia river as far as the mouth of the Sandy River.  Under Oregon Steam Navigation Company Advertisement placed January 26, 1871 for Wenat and other steamers of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. The Oregon Steam Navigation Company bought Wenat and ran the vessel on the Cowlitz River, between Monticello and Pumphrey's Landing, which, by 1877, was known as Olequa. Wenat frequently ascended as far as Cowlitz Prairie. As of January 26, 1871, Wenat was running under the ownership or control of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, the most powerful steamboat concern on the Columbia River. Starting on January 26, 1871, under Capt. Wm. H. Smith, Wenat departed Portland every Monday and Thursday at 6:00 a.m. for Pumphrey's Landing, and then returned the next day, departing Pumphrey's at noon. O.S.N. encountered some competition on this route from the steamer Carrie, running to Monticello under Capt. James Fisher. During 1871 and 1872 during the construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad, Wenat made \\"a cord of money\\" for the O.S.N. while under the command of Capt. Billy Smith. In May 1872 the stage took 15 hours to travel between Pumphrey's Landing, and Olympia. The stage line was then managed by one Coggan, and his wife, who kept the books. Once travelers from Olympia reached Monticello, on Wenat, they would stay overnight in the town, and depart the next morning for Portland on the steamer Rescue, under Capt. Richard Hoyt. In 1874, O.S.N. transferred control of Wenat back to Joseph Kellogg, who then ran the vessel on the Columbia up to the Sandy River. Transfer to Puget Sound In 1875, Wenat was sold to Capt. J.C. Brittain, of Seattle, W.T. who brought the steamer to Puget Sound. Having departed from Astoria, Oregon, Wenat arrived in Port Townsend, W.T. on June 8, 1875, under Captain Brittain. Wenat was towed to Port Townsend by the steam tug Favorite, under Captain Winsor. Brittain intended to use Wenat on the White River trade. Also running on the White River at that time was the steamer Comet. Wenat made its first trip on the Duwamish River on the morning of June 16, 1875, bringing down a raft of logs in the evening. The owners of Wenat had a contract to tow scows for a concern known as Talbot. Wenat was also used for coal company operations on the Black River, a tributary of the Duwamish River which until 1916, was the natural outlet of Lake Washington. Starting in 1874, the sternwheeler Otter also ran on the Duwamish. Disposition In March 1877 Wenat was laid up in Seattle, at Mechanics' Square, next to Carkeek's stone yard. The engines were scheduled to be removed in the first week of April 1877, after which the steamer would be converted to a barge. However, Wenat seems not to have been dismantled at that time. On March 30, 1878, it was reported that \\"the regular periodical sinking of the steamer Wenat has occurred.\\" In the previous six months Wenat had either sunk or hit a snag three or four times, with the most recent event occurring on the Duwamish River. Wenat, running under Capt. Henry Bailey, had gone up the White River, a tributary of the Duwamish, to pick up a load of 30 tons of potatoes. While coming downriver on the Duwamish, on the night of March 29, Wenat struck some sunken pilings, which tore a hole in the bottom of the hull, and sunk the steamer immediately. The steamer Comet went to the assistance of the Wenat the next afternoon. It was speculated that the potatoes would not be much damaged by their immersion, and could simply be washed off and sent to their ultimate destination, San Francisco, where potatoes were reported to be going for unusually high prices. An initial newspaper report was that Captain Bailey was not to blame, but that the vessel was difficult to handle in swift water when heavily loaded. The March 1878 caused so much damage that the boat could not be economically repaired. For $1,700 it was sold to J.H. (or J.J.) Moss, a half-owner of Wenat who removed the engines and installed them into a new sternwheeler, Josephine.

The Greater Toronto area has the largest concentration of the followers of Jainism in Canada and has the most number of Jain temples of all Canadian cities. History There are about 10,000 Jains in Canada, mostly concentrated in one province. Two-thirds of the Jain community is concentrated in the metropolitan Toronto area. In 2011, the temple construction was overseen by Bhattarak Charukeerthi, Moodabidri from India. Many people brought their own bricks to lay for the foundation of the temple. The temple celebrated its Pratishta Mahotsav in 2014. In 2015, 2000 people visited the temple for its anniversary celebrations, which was marked by religious discourses. MPP Dipika Damerla was present on the occasion to present Premier Kathleen Wynne's wishes to the Jain community. Architecture The Jain temple is the first one in Canada to use traditional Indian architecture. The temple also has a Manastambh, the second Jain temple in North America to have one. A Manastambh, or Pride Pillar, indicates a loss of pride for the worshipper before entering the temple.

As of June 2016, it had an estimated 900,000 users. MassRoots for Business, the company‚Äôs advertising portal, has an estimated 1,000 clients as of June 2015. In 2014, MassRoots was one of the first cannabis-related companies to go public through a Registration Statement on Form S-1 and trades under the ticker ‚ÄúMSRT‚Äù and in August 2015, MassRoots submitted an application to up-list its stock to the Nasdaq. History=Foundation= In April 2013, co-founders Isaac Dietrich and Tyler Knight were smoking in a college apartment when they conceptualized the idea for MassRoots because, ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt want their grandmothers to see pictures of them taking bong rips on Facebook.‚Äù They recruited longtime friend Hyler Fortier to design the initial user interface in Photoshop and later brought in Hyler‚Äôs brother, Stewart Fortier, to develop the original iOS application. MassRoots launched in the App Store on July 14, 2013 and in its first few weeks, gained several thousand users through Reddit, Instagram and word-of-mouth. Dietrich maxed out $17,000 in credit cards to fund the company‚Äôs operations while being turned down by dozens of Silicon Valley venture capital firms for being cannabis-related. =ArcView Group and seed round= Dietrich was invited to pitch The ArcView Group, one of the first and largest cannabis angel investment groups in the country, co-founded by Steve DeAngelo and Troy Dayton in September 2013. At the event, he met Douglas Leighton, co-founder of Dutchess Capital, who invested the first $50,000 of a $150,000 seed round. Over the course of the fall of 2013 and spring 2014, MassRoots used the funds to launch a beta version of its Android application and scale to 100,000 users. =Going public= MassRoots was organically growing by 20,000 to 30,000 users per month by March 2014. Dietrich once again pitched MassRoots to dozens of Silicon Valley venture capital firms, only to be turned away again for the same reason as before. As private financing was unavailable, MassRoots decided to go public through a Registration Statement on Form S-1, one of the first cannabis related companies to do so. Over the course of the summer of 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued over 75 comments on MassRoots‚Äô S-1 before allowing it to go effective by operation of law in September 2014. =Banned from iOS App Store, user campaign, and reversal= MassRoots broke into the top 200 fastest growing social networks in the iOS App Store in November 2014, catching Apple‚Äôs attention. The App Store determined it didn‚Äôt want a social platform entirely devoted to cannabis, so Apple permanently banned MassRoots and created a rule that all cannabis social networks were prohibited, preventing the 40% of the United States population who own iPhones and iPads from downloading its app. In January 2015, MassRoots united the cannabis industry against this ban ‚Äì over 10,000 of its then 200,000 users sent personal emails to Apple on why they love and use MassRoots. Dozens of cannabis business leaders authored a policy letter arguing that Apple‚Äôs policies were stifling innovation in the cannabis industry and holding back social progress. In February 2015, Apple reversed their policy, allowing MassRoots back into the App Store. CEO Isaac Dietrich noted at the time, ‚ÄúThroughout this campaign, the MassRoots team never stopped using our iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads as a testament to Apple‚Äôs world-class products. We‚Äôd like to thank the App Store for embracing the cannabis community and continuing to set an example as a socially-progressive institution. We are excited to begin a new chapter with Apple in which we can work together to affect meaningful societal change.‚Äù =Stock starts trading and beginning of monetization= MassRoots‚Äô stock began trading under the ticker MSRT in April 2015. During its first few weeks of trading, MassRoots‚Äô users were the primary buyers of the stock, enabling them to invest in a product they love. The week of 4/20/15, MassRoots‚Äô stock traded over $7 million in volume and was one of the most active stocks on the entire OTC market. By August 2015, MassRoots had broken a half million users with hundreds of millions of user-to-user interactions, providing more than enough activity to begin to monetize its network. In late August, Dietrich announced the company had begun to generate revenue through advertising, making approximately $60,000 in its first 6 weeks. The company reportedly is, ‚Äúnot recreating the wheel when it comes to monetization, just taking a model that worked for Facebook and Twitter and applying it to the cannabis sector.‚Äù The company enables dispensaries and cannabis brands to reach their target consumers. Website and mobile application The mobile application for iOS and Android was launched before the web version. MassRoots allows users to interact with each other via photo or video uploads with text to accompany it, from there, users can interact with each other by liking or commenting on the post. There is also a blog that accompanies it with posts ranging from cannabis-related news to informational posts to tips.

Its structure is originally a Greek doric temple, and for this reason it is included in a UNESCO World Heritage Site designated in 2005. The cathedral stands in the city's historic core on Ortygia Island.  History  The origins of a temple on this site date to prehistory. The great Greek Temple of Athena was built in the 5th century BC. The temple was a Doric edifice with six columns on the short sides and 14 on the long sides. Plato and Athenaeus mention the temple, and the looting of its ornament is mentioned by Cicero, in 70 BC, as one of the crimes of the governor Verres. Archeological site excavations by Paolo Orsi in 1907-1910 show the Greek temple to have been built on even older foundations, and uncovered a wealth of archaic and pre-Hellenic artefacts. Many are held by the Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi in Syracuse. The present cathedral was constructed by Saint Bishop Zosimo of Syracuse in the 7th century. The battered Doric columns of the original temple were incorporated in the walls of the current church. They can be seen inside and out.The Oxford Companion to Archaeology, by Brian M. Fagan, 1996, page 646 The building was converted into a mosque in 878, then converted back when Norman Roger I of Sicily retook the city in 1085. The roof of the nave is of Norman origin, as well as the mosaics in the apses. As part of the increased building activity after the 1693 Sicily earthquake, the cathedral was rebuilt and the fa√ßade redesigned by architect Andrea Palma in 1725‚Äì1753. The style is classified as High Sicilian Baroque, a relatively late example. The double order of Corinthian columns on the facade provide a classic example of carved Acanthus leaves in the capitals. Sculptor Ignazio Marabitti contributed the full-length statues on the facade. The interior of the church, a nave and two aisles, combine rustic walls and Baroque details. Features include a font with marble basin dating from the 12th or 13th century, a ciborium (an altar canopy) designed by architect Luigi Vanvitelli, and a statue of the Madonna della Neve (\\"Madonna of the Snow\\", 1512) by Antonello Gagini.  St. Lucy  As of 2015 the cathedral holds a number of relics of St. Lucy, the patroness of the city: a number of bone fragments, a robe, a veil, and a pair of shoes.Saints In Rome and Beyond, by Daniel Thelen, pages 129-130 Twice a year on the first Sunday in May and on December 13, her feast day, a statue of Saint Lucy by sculptor Pietro Rizzo (1599) is brought out of the cathedral and paraded through the streets. The silver statue incorporates three fragments of her ribs within its chest. The cathedral shares the Piazza Duomo with the Church of Santa Lucia Alla Badia, a short walk to the south. That church owns and displays the Caravaggio painting Burial of St. Lucy.  World Heritage Site  The cathedral stands as an major element of the historic core of Syracuse. Since 2005, the entire city of Syracuse, along with the Necropolis of Pantalica, was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This programme aims to catalogue, name and conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity. The deciding committee which evaluates potential candidates described their reasons for choosing Syracuse because \\"monuments and archeological sites situated in Syracuse are the finest example of outstanding architectural creation spanning several cultural aspects; Greek, Roman and Baroque\\", following on that Ancient Syracuse was \\"directly linked to events, ideas and literary works of outstanding universal significance\\".

His research focuses on social evolution across multiple scales, using genetic and ecological approaches. He is one of the initiators of the imprinted brain theory. In 2010, he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Career After earning his PhD and conducting postdoctoral work in Europe, Crespi joined the faculty at Simon Fraser University in 1992. In 2006, he was the recipient of a Killam Research Fellowship. left In 2008, Crespi published a paper describing observed patterns of imprinting in humans and other organisms. He explained that Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process by which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. The imprinted brain theory is a variant of the conflict theory of imprinting which argues that in diploid organisms, such as humans, the maternal and paternal set of genes may have antagonistic reproductive interests since the mother and father may have antagonistic interests regarding the development of the child. Following this, he was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2013, Crespi and fellow UMich alumni Kyle Summers co-edited \\"Human Social Evolution, The Foundational Works of Richard D. Alexander,\\" which was published through the Oxford University Press. In 2016, Crespi won SFU's Nora and Ted Sterling Prize in Support of Controversy for his evolutionary biology research. The next year, he conducted a study with Gerhard Gries, and Regine Gries to study the effect of natural selection on stick insects and mating. He was also selected as a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Genetics and Psychology.

Many of the early demonstrations were made by investigators outside the medical field. Upon examination of the initial investigators, several key factors were common. The individuals had already either been experimenting along similar lines to Wilhelm R√∂ntgen with Crookes tubes and such, the physicists or scientists, or were actively associated with electrical work, the electricians, which made them particularly receptive to the technical appeal of the new science of X-rays. Records of the events reveal that among the medical men who witnessed the first images produced as radiographs, a rather small number had any great desire to employ X-rays directly in their own medical practice. After the early investigative work of Thomas Ranken Lyle, William Henry Bragg, Joseph Patrick Slattery, and others, almost all medical men were satisfied with soliciting the services of the external X-ray man when necessity arose for skiagraphs to be produced. As the utilization of X-rays became more acceptable, the involvement of electricians began to decline. As the hospitals started to be equipped with X-ray apparatus and installations under the care of radiologists and radiographers, the medical men began to accept the eventuality of the new technology. Up to this point, the private experimenters and investigators continued to be the initiators of new ideas for the medical profession in this new field.

It was also used in road racing in the KRTT faired version. When the KR was first introduced, it dominated motorcycle racing in the United States. In 1970 it was replaced by the long-lived and US race-winning Harley-Davidson XR-750. Class C racing American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) Class C racing was created in 1933 in response to low participation in racing and slow motorcycle sales during the decline in consumer disposable income of the Great Depression. The year before, Harley-Davidson was the only factory team to compete. That team had but one rider, Joe Petrali, who had swept every AMA national title in 1935, due in large part to lack of competition, as well as his talent. With declining AMA rider membership, the two major factories, Harley-Davidson and Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company, were left with greater influence over the organization, which they used to establish a uniform racing class with a low barrier to entry. Unlike the many incompatible classes found in car racing, the new class would use the same bikes across many disciplines, including road racing and quarter-mile (short track), half- mile, and one-mile ovals, while leaving out the specialized motorcycles used in hillclimbing, and the large displacement ( open-class bikes that competed in TT (or TT Steeplechase) racing. The Class C rules were designed to make racing accessible to the wider public, and not only well-financed professional teams and factories. Homologation rules and bike inspection were used to ensure the amateur riders in the general public could buy the same bikes as the factory team, and buy from the factory's whole catalog of speed parts as well. The displacement formula allowed side valve (or flathead) engines of up to 750cc, or 45.77\\", but an \\"equivalency rule\\" that limited more technically- advanced OHV engines, tantamount to the (primarily UK) import competition, to 500cc, or 30.51\\". From the time Class C was established in 1938 until the 1953 KR, Harley-Davidson relied on the WLDR, sold with lights, fenders and other equipment, intended to be ridden to the track by amateur racers, prepared by the rider and raced, and the race-only 1941-52 Harley-Davidson WR which was the direct ancestor of the KR. Development 1957 Harley-Davidson KR750, on display at the California Automobile Museum Development of the Model K street motorcycle began in 1950 in response to increased competition from UK brands Triumph, Norton, and BSA entering the US market in greater numbers due to post-World War II reductions in import duties, and the UK's need to boost exports. Technology found on the European imports, including a hydraulic fork front suspension, a rear swingarm, four-speed transmission, unit construction, and a hand, rather than foot, clutch control, were used on the new K and KR. Alongside the Model K street bike, the KR racer was developed to compete in Class C. Motorcycling writer Kevin Cameron characterized Harley-Davidson as \\"outside the mainstream of engine development in general, to say nothing of the racing mainstream,\\" noting that, for example, their first use of overhead valves (OHV) on a production motorcycle was one year after the last time an AMA TT race was won by an OHV engine, overhead camshaft (OHC) becoming the only competitive technology in TT racing thereafter. American brands Harley- Davidson and Indian favored flathead engines because Americans rode far longer distances than Europeans, over much rougher roads, with lower octane fuel, and had greater need for low-RPM torque than the greater power offered at higher engine speed of OHV engines. Additionally, while the low-priced Ford Model T car dominated the US motor vehicle market ever since World War I and kept motorcycling in a recreational niche market, in Europe, motorcycles were still mainstream, mass-market transportation, with sales and profits that justified ongoing technological investment. That changed after World War II, with lighter, faster and more utilitarian British imports pouring into the US as the UK was desperate for foreign currency to repay war debts, Harley-Davidson and Indian were forced to respond quickly to a newly-competitive and fast- changing market. Indian chose to meet their competitors on their terms, imitating the OHV parallel-twin design favored by the British imports, but technical hurdles proved too great for the new engine to save the company from its demise by 1953. Harley-Davidson chose to play to their own strengths, creating a pushrod OHV V-twin engine in 1936 retaining separate transmission, and the new, for Harley-Davidson, unit construction, introduced on the 1952 Model K (still side-valve). KRTT road racer Cycle World road tested a 1963 KRTT (or KR-TT) alongside a Harley-Davidson Sprint TT racer. They recorded a top speed of , and acceleration of 5.8 seconds. The time was 14.1 seconds at . Achievements In 1956, every Class C race was won by a Harley-Davidson KR. From 1955 through 1969, 12 of the 15 AMA Daytona 200 national championships were won by KRs. A 1957 KR appeared in the 1999 Guggenheim Museum's The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in New York and a 1963 KR was in the Las Vegas show. The AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame Classic Bikes collection includes two Harley- Davidson KRs: a 1959 KR that is the last motorcycle raced by three-time AMA Grand National Champion Joe Leonard, and Mert Lawwill's 1969 KR750.

Newer bridges later carried most of the north‚Äìsouth traffic and, after a concrete bridge bypassed the Drift Creek Bridge in the 1960s, Lincoln County preserved it as a pedestrian crossing and a monument to 19th-century pioneers. In 1988, however, county officials closed the bridge entirely after rot and insect damage made the structure unsafe. The county dismantled the bridge in 1997 and gave the timbers to Laura and Kerry Sweitz, who owned land north of the Drift Creek site. In 2000, the Sweitz family rebuilt the bridge over Bear Creek and granted a permanent public easement at that site. Bear Creek is a tributary of the Salmon River, which it enters near Rose Lodge. The original Howe truss bridge had board-and-batten siding, arched portals, and ribbon windows along the eaves. Before being dismantled, it was the closest covered bridge to the Oregon Coast.

Beginning in 1911, Longren successfully flew airplanes of his own design and construction. Fully self- taught as an aircraft designer and pilot, he built a thriving career as a barnstormer with his own craft, becoming known throughout the Midwest as the \\"Birdman\\". He established his own aeronautics manufacturing company, Longren Aircraft Corporation, which produced several models through the 1920s. The handcrafted Longren planes were well regarded by aviation professionals of the era. Longren created several innovations including the design for the first semi-monocoque airplane body. In addition to his own independent enterprises, he worked for many years with some of the best-known companies in the industry ‚Äì Spartan, Luscombe, and Cessna ‚Äì until his retirement in 1945. Early life Albin K. Longren was born on January 18, 1882, in a rural cabin just outside Leonardville, Kansas. Known familiarly as \\"A.K.\\", he was one of the eight children of local farmers Charles and Emma Longren. As a young man he worked as a hardware dealer, but was also known as a handyman and an avid tinkerer who built his own automobiles and motorcycles out of spare parts. He served in the Clay Center Kansas National Guard and in that capacity was called to assist in crowd safety at one of the popular flying demonstrations in Topeka in June 1910. Longren's interest in aircraft was ignited after he witnessed the featured airplane spin out shortly after takeoff and crash to the ground. The 28-year-old tinkerer immediately set upon building his own improved version of a flying machine. Aviation career=Topeka I= Longren obtained space in Topeka for a small factory and enlisted the help of his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing to forestall publicity of any potential failures; they even disassembled the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial. The new biplane was long with a wingspan, and weighed . A pusher configuration with a 60-hp V8 engine and two ribbed canvas wings, the debut Longren aircraft ‚Äì eventually designated the Topeka I ‚Äì flew for the first time in trials beginning on September 2, 1911. Three days later, in his first public demonstration, Longren piloted the plane through a brief but satisfying circular pattern at in the air, for a total distance of about . A beaming Longren told the local newspaper, \\"I'm glad now to let the people of Topeka know what I've built.\\" Dolly and A.K. Longren, =Longren Aircraft Company= AK Number 6 Model G biplane To pay for construction of new planes at his factory, Longren performed frequently at airshows. Barnstorming before crowds across the U.S., he became a popular attraction in his own right, nicknamed \\"Birdman\\". Longren, who had never had formal training as a pilot, ended up flying 1,372 demonstrations over the next few years. Longren met his future wife Dolly Trent while performing in Minneapolis and married her soon thereafter. His wife quickly became an essential member of his small-scale airplane factory: admiringly he said, \\"she could repair a plane as well as any man.\\" A Kansas beauty queen, Dolly also helped Longren's cause in the arena of public relations. As one historian wrote, \\"she was a bubbly counterpart to her taciturn husband.\\" Longren established his own firm, the Longren Aircraft Corporation of Topeka, and began offering his airplanes via mail order. He designed and sold ten different models, all of which were acknowledged for their high quality and durability. The company, however, had only moderate sales and fluctuating commercial success. In late 1915, he was seriously injured in a mishap at a flying demonstration in Abilene, Texas, and thereafter the barnstormer devoted most of his time to architecture and design. He also took some time off beginning in 1917 when America entered the First World War ‚Äì for nearly two years, he served as chief inspector of aircraft at the nation's first military aviation research and development center, McCook Field in Ohio. =Longren AK= Returning to Topeka, he set upon constructing what he billed as \\"The New Longren Airplane\\", also known as the Longren AK. A small biplane powered by a 60-hp Anzani three-cylinder radial engine, the AK was sturdy, fast, and nimble. Its most arresting feature, however, was the folding set of wings which, when turned inward on the fuselage, shrank the plane's width from to a mere . Longren hoped that buyers would keep the tidy craft in barns or car garages; it was thought that the AK could become \\"the Ford of the air\\". With its new products, the struggling company had achieved national stature by 1921, just a decade after Longren's first flight. =Fuselage design= The AK was not the commercial breakthrough that Longren would have liked, but it featured a design innovation that would burnish his reputation greatly. Improving upon the day's standard airplane bodyform ‚Äì essentially a wooden frame with a fabric skin ‚Äì Longren designed the first semi-monocoque fuselage. The AK body was formed by joining two mirroring halves into a simple but aerodynamic shape. The two halves formed a hard shell, made of strong vulcanized fibrous material and reinforced on both sides with wood veneer. The advanced design of the AK was remarkable for its day, and presents what Air & Space/Smithsonian calls \\"the world's first semi-monocoque, truly composite shell fuselage\\". The U.S. government showed interest in Longren's finely handcrafted airplanes. Karl Smith, a general inspector from the Navy, toured the Topeka factory and his report praised Longren's low-tech manufacturing skills: despite using \\"more or less unsatisfactory equipment\\", Longren was able to produce a first-rate fuselage which the inspector described as \\"phenomenal in its strength and particularly easy to build\\". The fuselage's three-ply bonded material particularly impressed the Navy, who found its resistance to bullets most intriguing. But the novice entrepreneur was unable to raise the necessary capital to begin production in the desired quantities, and the Navy took its business elsewhere. =Later work= Despite all his prowess in piloting and design work, Longren was unable to maintain the financial side of his business and in 1924 he declared bankruptcy. He sold most of the company's assets and designs to new investors who in turn founded the Alexander Aircraft Company. Longren went on to work as a prized consultant for several other aeronautics firms including Spartan and Luscombe. He was responsible for numerous aviation-related patents throughout his career. His most significant work concerned the process of \\"stretch-forming\\" metal into assembly-ready fuselage panels. Luscombe was the first of many manufacturers to benefit from this patent when it produced its Luscombe Phantom, the first mass-produced airplane with an all-aluminum, semi-monocoque fuselage. Longren brought most of his patents over to Cessna in 1935 when he joined that company as Vice-President for the next three years. Through the 1930s, new incarnations of Longren Aircraft appeared briefly, according to Longren's energies and financial state. The last and most substantial iteration was conceived in 1938 solely as a fuselage manufacturer, with headquarters in Torrance, California. It persevered long after its founder's departure, until April 1959, when it was acquired by Aeronca. Death and legacy After his 1945 retirement, Longren moved to a ranch in Adin, California, where he stayed until his death in 1950. His body was brought back to Kansas and buried near his birthplace in Leonardville. He ranks as an early pioneer of aviation, having built and flown his own inventions at a time roughly contemporaneous with the Wright brothers during the heady, pre-World War I era of aeroplane vogue. He was accepted into the exclusive pioneers' club of Early Birds of Aviation soon after its 1928 foundation, and he was formally added to the Kansas Aviation Museum's Hall of Fame in 1997. A single example of Longren's aircraft ‚Äì the 1914 pusher biplane that he crashed in Abilene ‚Äì remains on permanent exhibit at the Kansas Museum of History. Longren remains a local Kansas hero: the state's Aviation Hall of Fame recognizes him for \\"outstanding aviation contributions\\". Kansas is home to Amelia Earhart and Clyde Cessna, and the city of Wichita is celebrated as the \\"Air Capital of the World\\", but Longren holds the distinction of being the state's first successful pilot and its first aircraft manufacturer.

She has been awarded Female Jazz Vocalist of the Year 2018 by long time Los Angeles/Long Beach jazz radio programmer, Saul Levine. In 2019 Spotify reported Lyn Stanley's music was played in 76 countries with over 300,000 minutes of download or streaming play. Her recording career has generated international recognition as one of today's top jazz vocalists. Her father was a hobby jazz pianist while her grandfather, who had emigrated from Bulgaria, was an opera singer. Her music is played on Jazz radio stations worldwide working with high-profile Los Angeles and New York jazz musicians. She began her professional life in advertising, worked as a Fortune 500 marketing executive and a college adjunct professor and instructor in marketing communications. She trained as an International Standard amateur ballroom dancer and won USA Pro/Am Dancesport Championship titles in 2010. Career Beginning in 2010, she became interested in singing. After taking singing lessons for a few months, in 2013 she started her singing career with her album Lost in Romance. Her debut album, produced by Steve Rawlins was an international success. With the release of her second album, Potions [From the 50s], Stanley performed songs composed in the 1950s. In October 2015 she released her third album, Interludes in Tokyo, Japan and started an American radio campaign in January 2016 for this album. Highly regarded engineers Al Schmitt (21 Grammy Awards) and mastering engineer Bernie Grundman have recorded, mixed, and mastered most of Lyn Stanley's albums. However, in 2019 she engaged Grammy Award-winning engineer, Allen Sides, for both mixing and/or recording her Julie London two- album project, including a direct-cut vinyl recording (see direct to disc below). On January 15, 2016, a party was held at the La Cicada Club in Los Angeles to celebrate the release of her album Interludes. Annette Warren, at 93, was one of those who performed at the show. With her husband Paul Smith, the jazz pianist best known for his work with Ella Fitzgerald, they encouraged Stanley to give up competitive ballroom DanceSport as a USA amateur champion four years earlier to become a jazz singer. In December 2016 Stanley announced her next album, entitled The Moonlight Sessions, Volume One and The Moonlight Sessions, Volume Two released in 2017. In April 2017 a three-part story about her recording career and her 2017 albums was released by John Stancavage at Part-Time Audiophile. Stanley announced the release date of May 30, 2017 for The Moonlight Sessions, Volume One and Volume Two in two formats‚Äîdouble vinyl 45RPM‚ÄîSpecial Limited Edition using the One-Step pressing process and Super Audio CDs (SACD). This vinyl pressing process was popular in the 1950s before mass production of vinyl records was needed to meet demand. The One Step vinyl album uses the original lacquer to create the Father or Master stamper which then makes the final vinyl records (1-1000 units only) sold to the consumer. The Moonlight Sessions, Volumes One and Two were recorded in February 2017 by Al Schmitt and Steve Genewick. Mixing engineer was Michael Bishop of Five/Four Productions and the album was mastered by Bernie Grundman. Musicians included pianists Mike Garson, Christian Jacob, and Tamir Hendelman; bassist Chuck Berghofer; guitarist John Chiodini; drummers Joe LaBarbera, Bernie Dresel and Ray Brinker. Soloists included Hendrik Meurkens, Rickey Woodard, Chuck Findley, Corky Hale and Carol Robins. Lyn Stanley has won Best Album and Best New Artist awards by Global Music Awards and Hollywood Music and Film Awards. She also In 2018, Stanley recorded her sixth album, London Calling: A Toast to Julie London, released in December. Engineers were Steve Genewick for recording and Allen Sides for mixing. No arrangements were used. Rather, chord charts created the road map allowing for freedom to change musical ideas. These impromptu arrangements were created by Lyn Stanley and her musicians (guitarist John Chiodini; pianists Mike Garson and Christian Jacob; drummers/percussionists Luis Conte, Aaron Serfaty, Paul Kreibich, Brad Dutz; bassists Chuck Berghofer (who worked with Julie London) and Michael Valerio. There are 15 Julie London covers and two additional songs Stanley added as bonus tracks. A video about creating the album was filmed. This 33.3 RPM album received several review accolades including Paul Seydor's five-star review in The Absolute Sound. In January 2019, Stanley recorded her seventh album-a direct to disc, London with a Twist: Live at Bernie's, as a follow up to her Julie London tribute that included London covers and some additional songs London did not record including \\"Pink Cadillac.\\" This unusual and very challenging \\"no fixes possible\\" recording and live mix were engineered by Allen Sides at Bernie Grundman's Mastering Studio in Hollywood. Bernie Grundman mastered the lacquer instantly from the live mix created by Sides. There are over 12 minutes of music on each side with Lyn Stanley performing on each song (with short instrumental interludes) making her one of a handful of solo vocal recording artists to achieve this amount of continuous recording time; typically these albums are instrumental only. To achieve the four songs per vinyl record side, a pause of 3-5 seconds was necessary to create the gap between songs. The listener can hear pages turning and other artifacts typically removed from studio recordings. The band for this album, who coined themselves \\"Jazz Mavericks,\\" are: John Chiodini (guitar) Mike Lang and Otmaro Ruiz (piano), Chuck Berghofer (bassist), Luis Conte (percussion) and Aaron Serfaty (drums). Reviews for this album position Stanley as one of the top jazz vocalists today. Lyn Stanley and her Jazz Mavericks performed live in front of an audience at Capitol Recording Studio A on June 1, 2019. A Blu-ray multi-track 5.1 surround sound high definition 1080K video and 192/24 bit stereo audio are in production with a delivery date targeted for alate Spring 2020 release.

She was also nominated by Hollywood Media in Music July 2016 Awards for her song on the Interludes album entitled \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" in the jazz category. British publication HiFi Choice featured Stanley in 2018 in the story \\"The New Gold Standard\\" by David Niven. Niven states, \\"People call her a jazz chanteuse with a voice to make you melt, but she's more than that ‚Äì not only someone with solid audiophile sensibilities, but also a denizen of the mixing desk and on a mission to ensure her music, beyond the live experience, can be enjoyed in the highest quality possible.\\" In April 2019, radio programmer Saul Levine of Los Angeles-Long Beach Metro Area and largest jazz radio audience, KKJZ-88.1 FM, named her Female Jazz Vocalist of the Year for 2018.

The villa was built in 1958 and was listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 11 January 2008. The house was built by the architect Knud Friis as his home and study on a hill overlooking Brabrand Lake in the Brabrand suburb. Knud Friis owned the architect firm Friis & Moltke with his partner Elmar Moltke and they collaborated on most of their projects including their private residences in the Aarhus area. In 1957 Knud Friis and his wife bought a 3000 m2 parcel of land on top of a hill overlooking Brabrand Lake and decided to build their new home there. The original house was built in 1958 and consisted of two parallel wings oriented north to south and connected by two walls that isolates a paved courtyard between the structures. The structure of the main building is formed by the two white garden walls which carry the 1st floor concrete walls which appear like free hanging beams along the width of the garden. The main building is in two floors with kitchen, dining room, bath and guest rooms on the ground floor while the living room, bedroom and study were on the 1st floor while the other wing contained the garage and shed. In 1970 the villa was expanded with a third partially submerged wing to the east, separated from the main building by a skylight column. Most rooms were moved to this new wing leaving more space for other activities in the main building. The villa is an example of brutalist architecture. The walls are of raw concrete with visible marks from formwork boards, the doors and windows are very noticeable and kept in blue and the floors are paved with rock or linoleum. The raw appearance is appeased by the hilly and lush surroundings high above the lake.

US Consulate in Krak√≥w, Poland, with two Albertine Sisters.  History = Foundations = The founder Adam Chmielowski (1845-1916), later known as Saint Brother Albert came from an aristocratic Polish family. Orphaned at a young age, he grew up expecting to take responsibility for the family estates and studied agriculture. The young student, however, was a strong Polish nationalist and took part in the January Uprising of 1863, in the course of which he lost his leg. Chmielowski was forced to flee Poland due to the repressive response of the Czarist authorities and moved to Belgium to continue his studies. During that period, he discovered that he had artistic talent, and began to develop that ability. By the time of his return to Poland in 1874, he was an accomplished painter, who became successful in Krak√≥w. When he returned to his homeland, Chmielowski was struck at the degree of poverty he saw. He began to help at homeless shelters run by the city, where he grew to know the poorest segment of the population at first-hand. Over the next decade, he continued this service, while maintaining his artistic career, though he increasingly turned to religious themes. By 1887, Chmielowski had decided to abandon his career, to live among the poor and needy and to accept a beggar's life and lifestyle. On 25 August of that year, the feast of the patron saint of the Order, Saint Louis, King of France, he became a member of the Third Order of St. Francis, publicly wearing the traditional gray habit of the Order and took the name Brother Albert. He began to live in the shelters. He gave himself fully to the poor. = The Congregation = Upon the completion of his year of novitiate on the same feast in 1888, Albert Chmielowski was allowed to profess religious vows. At that time, he gathered other men who had expressed interest in sharing his commitment and established the Brothers of the Third Order of St. Francis, Servants of the Poor, in 1888. In the next couple of years, he worked on organizing a congregation for women to serve the poor in conjunction with his Brothers. The first woman to dedicate herself to the cause was Anna Luba≈Ñska of the Podlachia region of Poland, later known by her religious name as Sister Frances. The founding date of the Albertine Sisters was 15 January 1891, when the first seven sisters, including Anna Luba≈Ñska, received their habits in the Krak√≥w Bishops' Chapel, in the presence of Brother Albert Chmielowski and Cardinal Albin Dunajewski. Officially called the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis Serving the Poor, the first Sisters resided in a shelter for homeless women that they founded, located in Krak√≥w on Skawinska Street. Initially, Chmielowski had kept the congregation under his direct leadership. However, as both the Brothers and Sisters grew, it is likely that this method of leadership became inadequate. On 7 April 1902, he appointed Sister Bernardina the congregation's first Superior General. Born Maria Jab≈Ço≈Ñska, she was invested on March 6, 1897. She wrote the basis of the Constitution of the Albertine Sisters in 1917‚Äì1918, and presided over a time of significant growth. Sister Bernardina led the congregation for 38 years, until her death on September 23, 1940. As the Sisters grew in number, they opened more homeless shelters. The oldest remaining is the shelter at 47 Krakowska Street, which Chmielowski had elevated to the main shelter in 1908. By 1916, they were active in the cities of Krak√≥w, Jaroslaw, Przemy≈õl, Zakopane, and Kandielce in Poland, and Lviv and Sokal in Ukraine. At the time of Sister Bernardina's death, the Albertine Sisters numbered 500 and ran 56 institutions. On June 19, 1926, the Albertine Sisters' leadership met with Prince-Bishop Adam Stefan Sapieha as part of the approval process for the Congregation. Three days later, Sapieha approved the Sisters a congregation of diocesan right. On June 15, 1928, the Sisters established a new motherhouse in Krak√≥w. It held a large chapel, and a postulate and novitiate for young entrants to the Congregation. In 1947, the gradual socialization of private healthcare and other charitable institutions began. Soon, the Sisters in Poland were left with little control over many of their ministries. By now, the congregation had left Ukraine, which was much more hostile under Soviet rule than Poland, a very Catholic country. On September 17 1955, the Holy See approved the Albertine Sisters a congregation of pontifical right, moving them from under the authority of the Archbishop of Krak√≥w to the direct authority of the Pope. Ten years later, the Holy See gave official approval of the Constitution of the Albertine Sisters. = Recent times = At the present time, the Albertine Sisters administer 69 foundations. Poland holds 53 of these, and the other 16 are distributed in Argentina, Bolivia, Italy, Russia (Siberia), the United States, Ukraine, and Vatican City. = Superior General = # First Superior General: Blessed Sister Bernardina (1902‚Äì1940)  References  Category:1891 establishments in Poland Category:Catholic religious orders established in the 19th century https://albertinesisters.org/about-us/ ","title":"Albertine Sisters"},{"id":"49205017","text":"Leon C. \\"Ex\\" Exelby (1888 ‚Äì September 29, 1962) was an American football player and coach of football and basketball.

She was a final-year dental student at the University of Tehran in 1999, when she participated in the student protest together with her husband Saeed Bashirtash. As a result, she was arrested and wound up in prison. After she was temporarily released on bail, she decided to flee together with husband via Turkey to Belgium. She was sentenced in absence to two years of imprisonment by the revolutionary court of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In Belgium she graduated again as a dentist. Activism In 2014 she founded the group ‚ÄòLet Iranian Women Enter Their Stadiums‚Äô to strive for the right of Iranian women to attend sport games in stadiums.. She uses the stadium ban as a symbol of one of the many discriminations Iranian women are confronted with on a daily basis. In February 2015, Darya Safai wrote a letter to Sepp Blatter, at that time President of FIFA, about the situation of the Iranian women and what they expected from FIFA. FIFA does not comply its statutes regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran: Article 3 of FIFA‚Äôs statutes: ‚ÄúDiscrimination of any kind against a Country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.‚Äù '' This letter has been supported and signed by more than 200 prominent Iranian academics, human-, civil- and political activists, political prisoners and artists.

It was built in the Baroque style in 1724 to designs of Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, during the magistracy of Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena. History The city of Maleth was founded by the Phoenicians in around 700 BC, and it later became part of the Roman Empire under the name Melite. The Punic-Roman city occupied all of present-day Mdina, and its walls also extended into part of Rabat. The city was reduced to its present size sometime during the early medieval period, either by the Byzantines or the Arabs. By the 15th century, the city (now known as Mdina) was defended by a system of double walls on the land front, with the main entrance being located close to the southeast corner of the city, near a tower known as the Turri Mastra. Mdina Gate and the walled up medieval entrance In the medieval period, the main entrance to Mdina consisted of three gates which were separated by courtyards. The outer gate was called the Prima Porta Principale or the Porta di Santa Maria, and it was decorated with the coat of arms of Sua Cesarea Majestati in 1527. A barbican was built to protect the gate sometime after 1448, but it was demolished in 1551 since it was no longer regarded as being suitable for defence. It is believed that this gate was reconstructed by the Order of St. John in the early 17th century. In 1722, Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena issued orders for the restoration and renovation of Mdina. The city entrance was completely rebuilt, and a new Baroque gate was built to designs of the French architect Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion in 1724. Since the courtyards behind the old gate were demolished to make way for the Palazzo Vilhena, the original gate was walled up and the new one was built a couple of metres to its left. The city's medieval fortifications were also rebuilt at this point, and the Turri Mastra was demolished and replaced by the Torre dello Standardo. The Mdina Gate was depicted on a Lm2 commemorative silver coin minted by the Central Bank of Malta in 1973. The rear of the gate, along with the Torre dello Standardo, was depicted on the Lm5 banknote that was in circulation between 1989 and 2007. The gate was restored in 2008 by the Restoration Unit of the Works Department. Today, the Mdina Gate is one of the main tourist attractions of Mdina. The gate was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture Inscription and Vilhena's coat of arms Rear of the gate The Mdina Gate consists of a Baroque portal and a superstructure serving as a gatehouse. The portal is decorated with double pilasters, the coats of arms of Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena and the city of Mdina, a trophy of arms and a Latin inscription reading: The rear of the gate is decorated with reliefs of St. Publius, St. Agatha and St. Paul, who are the patron saints of Malta. An arched stone bridge, which is decorated by statues of lions holding the coat of arms of Vilhena or the town of Rabat, leads to the gate. A wooden √† la Vauban drawbridge originally linked the bridge to the gate. In popular culture The Mdina Gate represented one of the gates of King's Landing in the filming of Lord Snow, the third episode of the first season of Game of Thrones.

The organisation was formed in January 2016, as a result of infighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU, and officially launched on 23 January 2016 in Kettering. Despite its name, it was started by politicians from a mixture of political parties including Peter Bone, Tom Pursglove, Liam Fox of the Conservatives, Kate Hoey of Labour, Nigel Farage of UKIP and Sammy Wilson of the DUP. The left wing Respect Party later joined Grassroots Out. Campaign GO came into being following a number of controversies within Vote Leave, the original cross-party movement campaigning for Brexit, and infighting between Vote Leave and Leave.EU. The current affairs magazine Private Eye said: > Although [Grassroots Out] is little more than another Ukip front ‚Äì with > Farage at its launch and Ukip moneybags Arron Banks providing cash ‚Äì Labour > MP Kate Hoey has signed up, so disillusioned are she and other Labour > Euroscptics with Kurtz [Dominic Cummings, leader of Vote Leave]. On 13 February 2016, Respect Party leader George Galloway interviewed UKIP leader Farage on Sputnik, the show he presents for the Russian RT television network; Galloway and Farage agreed on everything that was discussed and Galloway expressed his commitment to joining GO. On 6 February 2016, the campaign expressed interest into seeking the Electoral Commission designation for the official Leave campaign against Vote Leave and Leave.EU. Co founder of GO Tom Pursglove, said \\"If we are going to win this crucial referendum for the future of our country, it is imperative that the current impasse, which is serving as an enormous distraction, must come to an end and it seems that there is a growing mood that GO could well be the vehicle to achieve this ‚Äì indeed, we have been approached by many people in many parties, enquiring as to whether this might be possible.\\" On 16 February 2016, Go Movement Ltd (an umbrella group made up of Eurosceptics from GO, UKIP and Leave.EU ‚Äì but not Vote Leave) announced that it would apply to the Electoral Commission to be designated as the official Leave campaign for the upcoming referendum. On 13 April 2016, rival organisation Vote Leave was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official referendum campaign in favour of leaving the EU. In response, GO said it would now work with Vote Leave to win the EU Referendum. However, the Head of Communications for Leave.EU, Andy Wigmore, said that Leave.EU would apply for a judicial review of the decision. He suggested that the referendum could be delayed until 23 October 2016 while the review took place. Music and merchandise GO has generated a great deal of debate with its brand promotions in support of the Brexit campaign. Many of these products were summarised by columnist Joel Golby for The Guardian Comment is Free section. UKIP Parliamentary Candidate Mandy Boylett created a parody of the Three Lions anthem, which went viral in February 2016. Reviews ranged from \\"this anti EU music video parody is the worst song to come from UK politics yet\\" from Ryan Barrell in The Huffington Post to \\"It's an astonishing watch, arguably better than the original and with the potential to inspire just as many ordinary Englanders to get out and support their country. Ish\\" from Guy Kelly in The Telegraph. David Baddiel, who penned the original Three Lions anthem, described this version as \\"brilliantly naff\\". Marina Hyde in The Guardian suggested Boylett as the lead act in an anti EU music festival reportedly taking place in May. On 13 June 2016, Mandy Boylett launched a follow up Brexit song, penning new words to Pink's Get this party started.

Ct. 2347, 2355 (2014) (applying the Mayo test to software implemented business method, indicating its general applicability to patent-ineligible ideas). to invalidate as patent-ineligible a patent said to \\"solve ... a very practical problem accessing fetal DNA without creating a major health risk for the unborn child.\\"Dennis Crouch, Federal Circuit Reluctantly Affirms Ariosa v. Sequenom and Denies En Banc Rehearing, (Dec. 23, 2015). In December 2015, the Federal Circuit denied a motion for en banc rehearing, with several members of the court filing opinions urging Supreme Court review. On June 27, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Sequenom's petition for a writ of certiorari.https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062716zor_4fbi.pdf Background Sequenom is the exclusive licensee of U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540, which claims methods of using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal plasma (cell-free blood) to diagnose fetal abnormalities. Claim 1 is illustrative: > 1\\\\. A method for detecting a paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal > origin performed on a maternal serum or plasma sample from a pregnant > female, which method comprises: :amplifying a paternally inherited nucleic > acid from the serum or plasma sample and :detecting the presence of a > paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin in the sample. Amniocentesis The point of the invention is that the inventors discovered in 1996 that fetal DNA might be floating around in the mother's blood (not just in the blood of the fetus, which was accessible only by invasive methods, such as amniocentesis, that created risks of miscarriage). Then they realized that they could selectively amplify the fetal DNA by focusing on the paternally inherited portion of its DNA (rather than the maternally inherited DNA). The claim itself has two simple and conventional steps: first amplifying (by polymerase chain reaction, PCR) and then detecting the paternally inherited DNA from the plasma sample. The technology for amplifying and detecting DNA was already well known and generally used to detect DNA. There was a problem, however, of how to ascertain which DNA in the sample was that of the fetus and which was the mother's (which greatly outnumbered the fetal DNA in the sample).According to the patent, fetal DNA is from 0.39% of the sample (the lowest concentration measured in early pregnancy), to as high as 11.4% (in late pregnancy). The inventors realized that the fetus had DNA derived from the father as well as the mother, and that paternal DNA was not native to the mother's blood. So they wanted to focus on genetic fragments containing paternally inherited sequences the mother did not share, but had traveled from the fetal blood into the maternal blood through the placenta. The paternal DNA in the mother's plasma had to have come from the fetus. Then, they could reliably identify fetal DNA, which would in turn allow them to diagnose certain fetal genetic conditions such as Down Syndrome, which can be detected by observing presence of extra chromosomes. The inventors now had a test that did not require amniocentesis, which is invasive and may cause miscarriages. Sequenom became the exclusive licensee of the patent. After Sequenom launched its test on the market, several other companies began to market similar tests and cut prices. Sequenom sent letters to Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc., Natera, Inc. and Diagnostics Center, Inc.. threatening each of them with patent infringement suits. They responded by filing declaratory judgment actions against Sequenom. The district court construed the patent and denied a preliminary injunction, and Sequenom took an interlocutory appeal. On remand to the district court, it held the patent invalid as claiming the only viable method of detecting a natural phenomenon. The district court said: \\"[T]he claims at issue pose a substantial risk of preempting the natural phenomenon of paternally inherited cffDNA,\\" which made them patent-ineligible. Sequenom then appealed to the Federal Circuit. Ruling of the Federal Circuit=Panel decision= A three-judge panel affirmed the judgment of the district court. The majority concluded that the patent fails the two-step test that the Supreme Court developed in Mayo for determining whether a method patent impermissibly claims a natural law or phenomenon. First, the court said, the claims \\"are directed to a patent-ineligible concept\\" because the \\"method begins and ends with a natural phenomenon\\" (i.e., cffDNA). Second, it said, the claimed method did not \\"'transform' the claimed naturally occurring phenomenon into a patent-eligible application\\"of the phenomenon. The court reasoned that, \\"[f]or process claims that encompass natural phenomen[a], the process steps . . . must be new and useful.\\" But researchers already knew how to accomplish the individual steps of (1) fractionating blood; (2) amplifying DNA; and (3) detecting characteristics in amplified DNA. Therefore, the claimed method impermissibly added only \\"well-understood, routine, and conventional activity\\" to the natural phenomenon that the doctor inventors had discovered. That made the claimed subject matter patent-ineligible as a matter of law. The court said that it rejected Sequenom's argument that \\"implies that the inventive concept lies in the discovery of cffDNA in plasma or serum.\\" That discovery is the discovery of a natural phenomenon. The court also rejected the argument that the patent did not preempt the entire use of cffDNA and that some uses were unpreempted. While total preemption \\"may signal patent ineligible subject matter,\\" under Parker v. Flook. and other cases \\"the absence of complete preemption does not demonstrate patent eligibility.\\" The fact that once a court concludes that the claims involve only natural phenomena and \\"conventional\\" techniques, \\"preemption concerns are fully addressed and made moot.\\" Senior Judge Linn concurred separately, saying that he was \\"bound by the sweeping language of the test set out in Mayo.\\"788 F.3d at 1380. He explained also why he considered the Supreme Court's Mayo decision incorrect: > [T]he breadth of the second part of the test was unnecessary to the decision > reached in Mayo. This case represents the consequence ‚Äì perhaps unintended ‚Äì > of that broad language in excluding a meritorious invention from the patent > protection it deserves and should have been entitled to retain. =Denial of rehearing en banc= Sequenom sought rehearing en banc, but in December 2015 it was denied. However, several judges who concurred in the denial wrote separately that they disagreed with the sweep of the Supreme Court's Mayo decision that had compelled the result. Judge Lourie, joined by Judge Moore, argued that Mayo read without qualification, would not only bar the present invention but would mean that \\"nothing in the physical universe would be patent-eligible,\\" and thus it was \\"unsound to have a rule that takes inventions of this nature out of the realm of patent-eligibility on grounds that they only claim a natural phenomenon plus conventional steps.\\" Nonetheless, he agreed that Mayo compelled invalidation of this patent. Judge Dyk wrote that \\"a problem with Mayo insofar as it concludes that inventive concept cannot come from discovering something new in nature,\\" especially in biological sciences, is undesirable. But he insisted that \\"any further guidance must come from the Supreme Court, not this court.\\" Nonetheless, Judge Dyk offered some speculation as to how the Supreme Court might modify Mayo to accommodate biotech inventions. He suggested the possibility of rule that would exclude trolls but would admit pioneer discoveries of natural laws to a limited extent. Dyk said, \\"The Mayo/Alice framework works well when the abstract idea or law of nature in question is well known and longstanding, as was the situation in Mayo itself.\\" Yet. it may not be appropriate for discoveries of previously unknown laws of nature: > In my view, Mayo did not fully take into account the fact that an inventive > concept can come not just from creative, unconventional application of a > natural law, but also from the creativity and novelty of the discovery of > the law itself. This is especially true in the life sciences, where > development of useful new diagnostic and therapeutic methods is driven by > investigation of complex biological systems. I worry that method claims that > apply newly discovered natural laws and phenomena in somewhat conventional > ways are screened out by the Mayo test. Yet, \\"undue preemption\\" remains a major concern‚Äî\\"the fear that others' innovative future applications of the law will be foreclosed.\\" He therefore proposes a special test for natural law cases, keeping in mind the patent ineligibility of E=mc2 and based on a requirement to keep speculator trolls out: > [I]f the breadth of the claim is sufficiently limited to a specific > application of the new law of nature discovered by the patent applicant and > [actually] reduced to practice, I think that the novelty of the discovery > should be enough to supply the necessary inventive concept. My proposed > approach would require that the claimed application be both narrow in scope > and actually reduced to practice, not merely \\"constructively\\" reduced to > practice by filing of a patent application replete with prophetic examples . > . . [S]o long as a claim is narrowly tailored to what the patent applicant > has actually invented and reduced to practice, there is limited risk of > undue preemption of the underlying idea. Dyk adds that he recognizes that the problem with the enablement and written description requirements of 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 112 is that they do not provide adequate limitations on claim scope. They \\"generally require only that one or a handful of representative embodiments be described\\" by the patent applicant, allow speculative prophesies, and thus do \\"not entirely prevent claims that preempt future applications of the law of nature by others,\\" as he believes his proposal would. Finally, he said, Sequenom's claims would probably fail under the proposed test. because Sequenom claimed more than it taught: \\"any diagnosis of any disease, disorder, or condition. . . . impermissible attempts to capture the entire natural phenomenon of cffDNA rather than any particular applications thereof developed and actually reduced to practice by the inventors.\\" Therefore, a future case would be a better vehicle for Supreme Court exposition of the limited, newly discovered natural law aspect of \\"the Mayo/Alice framework.\\" Judge Newman alone dissented; in her view the claimed methods were patent eligible even under Mayo because they represent \\"new applications\\" of knowledge and not a patent on the knowledge itself. =Certiorari petition= On March 21, 2016, Sequenom filed a certiorari petition.Petition. The petition raises one question only: > Whether a novel method is patent-eligible where: : (1) a researcher is the > first to discover a natural phenomenon; : (2) that unique knowledge > motivates him to apply a new combination of known techniques to that > discovery; and : (3) he thereby achieves a previously impossible result > without preempting other uses of the discovery?See Gene Quinn, SCOTUS Blog > founder asks Supreme Court to reconsider Mayo ruling in Sequenom v.

Holman said that he hoped that \\"the Federal Circuit can find some way to rein in the unnecessarily expansive language of Mayo.\\" But if the Federal Circuit is as constrained by Mayo as is believed perhaps only Congress can come to the rescue, Kevin Noonan, a biotech blogger, considered the decision a \\"disaster.\\"Kevin E. Noonan, Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. (June 22, 2015). He blames the assertedly disastrous result on the Federal Circuit's failure to \\"consider the claim as a whole,\\" instead of which he says it \\"has broken its analysis into pieces (contrary to Supreme Court's Diamond v. Diehr decision).\\" He also blames the Federal Circuit for relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Parker v. Flook, as to which he says: \\"The applicability of that decision on life science inventions should have been firmly put to bed in Judge Rich's In re Bergy decision.See discussion of Bergy and Flook in Parker v. Flook#Criticism and response to Flook. Noonan's point about considering the whole apparently focuses on the fact that the named inventors were the first to discover the natural phenomenon that paternally derived fetal DNA passes into the maternal bloodstream and can be detected there. Although the discovery itself cannot be claimed, and the elements of the claimed diagnostic method applying the discovery are themselves well known in the art, Noonan believes that the meritoriousness of the discovery should be considered when deciding the patent eligibility of the diagnostic method. Noonan concedes that the type of analysis described in Flook \\"may make sense in claims to\\" electromechanical inventions such as that in Flook but not in regard to biotech inventions. Noonan closes with a blast at the Federal Circuit for a lack of courage or will to use available \\"analytical and doctrinal tools\\" to instruct the Supreme Court on correcting its past errors, because \\"shielding the Court from the consequences of their bad decisions does them a disservice.\\" Devlin Hartline maintains: > [T]he panel's decision striking down Sequenom's noninvasive prenatal test > strikes at the very heart of the patent system.

Sue Nym, a pseudonymous biotech blogger, deplores the state of patent- eligibility jurisprudence: \\"Seemingly every new court decision addressing subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101 progressively weakens the patent system, especially in the life sciences. And each case seems to present a new low in terms of the depth and quality of analysis.\\" She sees a common thread in these decisions, typified in Ariosa v. Sequenom ‚Äì judicial hostility to patents: > Courts are striking down patents simply because the challenger has convinced > the judge(s) . . . that the patents are bad, e.g., for patients, for large > electronics companies supposedly pestered by trolls. . . .

Nym, Ariosa is a Good > Example of Outcome-Driven ¬ß 101 Decisions, (Aug. 9, 2015). Biotech blogger Courtenay Brinckerhoff considers Judge Dyk's proposals to allow claims to what is actually reduced to practice and no more hopeful prophesies. She questions whether patents limited to what inventors actually reduce to practice and disclose in their patent applications would \\"adequately promote the fundamental policies underlying the patent system,\\" and she asks: > Would innovators find that scope of protection sufficient quid pro quo for > disclosing their inventions in their patent applications? Would companies > find that scope of protection sufficient to justify investment in research > and development?Courtenay C. Brinckerhoff, Judge Dyk Would Add Reduction To > Practice To Patent Eligibility Requirement, (Dec. 3, 2015). If not, she says, Dyk's test would just be too complicated and would discourage innovation. Patent Publius, associated in an undisclosed manner with George Mason University Law School, asserts: > The overbreadth of the Federal Circuit's analysis threatens diagnostic > methods across the board. If a method of detecting a natural phenomenon is > always \\"directed to\\" that natural phenomenon, as the Federal Circuit > suggests, then all such methods are prima facie patent ineligible under the > first step of the Mayo framework and must fight the uphill battle under its > second step. This is particularly troubling since virtually all diagnostic > tests detect natural phenomena. Moreover, the Federal Circuit's application > of the second step of the Mayo framework looks at each part of the method > individually, ignoring the claimed method as a whole. Publius complains further that the Federal Circuit fails to address Sequenom's central argument: \\"The claimed method is a new process of detecting cffDNA by devising a novel sample source from which to extract it, namely, maternal plasma or serum. The application and adaptation of known techniques in this inventive way to a newly-discovered sample source is not conventional.\\" He concludes with a warning of still worse things to come: > All told, the Federal Circuit's opinion in Ariosa v. Sequenom is a > predictable, yet unfortunate, application of the Supreme Court's disastrous > reasoning in Mayo.

According to Professor Rantanon, the Dyk opinion \\"hits the nail on the head\\" by \\"framing the patent eligible subject matter issue as an issue of claim breadth.\\" Rantanon agrees with Dyk that \\"Section 112(a) doesn't do an adequate job, by itself, of limiting claim breadth,\\" so that it is necessary, as Dyk does, to \\"articulate a conceptually coherent approach to patentable subject matter in the context of discoveries of natural laws, one that allows for valid claims in this space but which still imposes limits on what can be claimed.\\"Jason Rantanon, Judge Dyk's Concurrence in the Denial of Rehearing En Banc in Sequenom, (Apr. 13, 2016).

It is the oldest temple in Magna Graecia and the only Greek religious structure still visible in the old town of Taranto. The temple dates to the first quarter of the sixth century BC. It fell into ruin in the Middle Ages and parts of it were reused in the construction of other buildings. Description The devastation and ruination experienced by the temple over the centuries, especially the phenomenon of spoliation, has made it impossible to outline an exact plan of the temple. The two remaining columns of the Doric order and three drums of a third column base were made of local carparo stone taken from the city's acropolis and were part of the long side of the peristasis of the temple, whose remains have been identified in the choir and cellars of the Monastery of San Michele, which is near the ruins alongside the . The columns are 8.47 metres high with a diameter of 2.05 metres and are separated by an interval of 3.72 metres. From observation of the area of the peristasis and calculations of the relationship between its width and the interval, it has been suggested that the temple's front faced the navigable canal bridged by the Ponte di San Francesco di Paola, and that it had six columns on the short sides and 13 n the long sides. Further, the very low profile of the capitals and the column drums which are stacked atop one another without a central pin, indicates that they were manufactured before the beginning of the fifth century BC. It is assumed that the Doric peristyle belongs to a phase of renovation and expansion after the construction of the cella, since there are no structural connections between its foundations and those of the older nucleus. The presence of a little ditch next to the columns, as well as traces at the edge of it, suggest the existence of a pavement and a raised wooden platform belonging to an original cult building of rough bricks and perishable material built at the end of the 8th century BC by the original Spartan colonists.  Afterlife  If still in use by the 4th-and 5th century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. The sacred area became a granary in the 6th century when the population retreated into the peninsula for defensive reasons. In the 10th century, the remains of the temple formed a Christian church, while from the 14th century, part of the area was used for industrial activity, with clay decanting vases and little kilns. The ruins of the temple were incorporated into the Church of the Holy Trinity, the court of the Oratory of the Trinity, the Casa Mastronuzzi and the Convent of the Celestines. In 1700, ten sections of columns were still visible but they were removed and dispersed during the renovation of the convent in 1729. At the end of the 19th century, the archaeologist Liugi Viola investigated the remains of the temple and attributed it to Poseidon, but it was more likely connected to the female divinities Artemis, Persephone or Hera. Other remains were dispersed with the demolition of the convent in 1926 and of the nearby church in 1973.

Long (February 4, 1904 ‚Äì January 4, 1986) was an artist, historian, museum director, inventor and teacher who was notable for being a contributor to the Mount Rushmore monument.  Biography  Long was born in Auburn, New York, and spent most of his life there. He was the director of the Cayuga County Museum of History and Art. He also taught at Cayuga Community College, as well as briefly at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, and at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Long assisted Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum through careful measurements and studies of busts of the faces on the monument, in particular George Washington. Long helped with some of the on- site work as well, including at the rock face. Long was a member of the Finger Lakes commission to the New York World's Fair in 1939. During World War II Long worked as an instrument designer at Bausch and Lomb, Welch Allyn and IRI. He was awarded several patents for his designs. In 1959 Long organized an exhibit of Queen Victoria memorabilia at the Cayuga museum he directed. It was a popular exhibit and had to be held over beyond its original scheduled run. The core of the exhibit was memorabilia collected by Helen Hayes via donations from fans in Britain, in admiration of Hayes' portrayal of the queen. Long added other memorabilia as well. Long is credited with resurrecting the Cornplanter Medal in the early 1960s. The medal was not awarded for nearly 40 years, even though originally it was intended to be awarded every two years, with some allowance for irregularity. However, when Edwin Gohl was named the winner in 1926, it caused a dispute over whether it was appropriate for the award to go to local amateurs instead of academic professions. Long was able to bridge any remaining gap in philosophy and in 1965 it was awarded to William N. Fenton. Long himself was named a winner of the medal in 1975. Over the course of his career Long received many awards and recognition in art, history and teaching including fellow of the International Institute of History and Art, and member of UNESCO. Long and his wife Carmelita had three children. He died at his home in Auburn on January 4, 1986. References ;Attributions  } * * ;Other sources * Walter K.

In 1792 he accompanied Cadotte on an expedition down the Mississippi River into central Minnesota, which was then a hunting territory of the Dakota people. When Cadotte stopped to build a trading post on the Crow Wing River, R√©aume continued upstream to the Leaf River where he established his own post. Both posts were on an established water route between Lake Superior and the Red River of the North. R√©aume's post was abandoned at an unknown date and later burned to the ground. R√©aume himself must not have spent long at the post, because he is recorded working on the Assiniboine River after 1794. In 1797 he joined the North West Company, serving as a clerk and interpreter. In the 1802‚Äì1804 diary of fur trader George Nelson, R√©aume is referred to as \\"a respectable old gentleman\\" in charge of the Folle Avoine region and trading on the Snake River. Excavation Surveys in 1869 and 1901 first noted ditches, two diamond-shaped depressions, and piles of rock at the site, but these were presumed to be traces of a Native American fortification. It wasn't until 1972 that further surveys, correlated with historical narratives, suggested the site was that of R√©aume's trading post. Those efforts identified a stockade comprising two angled palisades, a ditch, and possibly a blockhouse. Within the stockade were depressions indicating the presence of buildings, and piles of rock suggesting collapsed chimneys. On the riverbank were two canoe landing sites. The few artifacts recovered at the time included some bone fragments and a nail. Archaeologist Amelie Allard of the University of Minnesota began conducting new studies of the site in 2011. Its exact location remains undisclosed as part of the agreement with the property owner.

It was built in 1837 and designed by Joseph John Scoles. It is situated on Priory Street between the junction with East Hill and St Thomas More Catholic Primary School in the town centre. Next to it is the church hall which was built in 1911 and designed by Alexander Scoles.Colchester - St James the Less and St Helen from English Heritage, retrieved 23 January 2016 History=Foundation= At the end of the eighteenth century, the Roman Catholic community in Colchester consisted of exiles from the French Revolution. In the early nineteenth century Irish Catholic soldiers were stationed in the town. In 1814, a French priest, Fr Amand Benard, served the community and the local garrison. In 1831, a building was provided for the local Catholic community near North Hill. It was given by William Dearn, a former soldier and local tradesman. A priest would come from Witham to say Mass there. =Construction= The site for the present church was donated by James Hoy, a farmer from Stoke-by-Nayland. The church mission there was funded by Alfred Stourton, 23rd Baron Mowbray. On 3 March 1837, the foundation stone for the church was laid by the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, Thomas Griffiths. Construction of the church cost ¬£2,750 in total. The architect was Joseph John Scoles. He designed the church in the Romanesque Revival style reminiscent of the nearby ruins of St Botolph's Priory. Scoles later used a similar plan when he designed St John the Evangelist Church in Islington four years later. The church was originally dedicated to Saint James the Greater. Also it had no external statues or images, to lessen any hostility from the local non-Catholic community. =Developments= In 1900, the church was renamed as St James the Less so as to avoid confusion with the nearby Anglican St James the Great Church on East Hill. Two years later, in 1902, the church name was again changed, to St James the Less and St Helen. Saint Helen was reported to have been born in Colchester by local historical accounts.Roman Catholicism in A History of the County of Essex: Volume 9, the Borough of Colchester from British History Online (London: Victoria County History, 1994), 338-339. In the 1850s, during the Crimean War the civilians in the congregation were outnumbered by the locally garrisoned Catholic soldiers. In 1865, a separate military chaplain was appointed to Colchester. In 1867 the chaplain used the camp chapel in Military Road. In 1904, St James' Church again became the garrison's centre for worship. In 1954, a garrison church was built in the Colchester Garrison. This closed in the 1980s. Since then, Masses for the army families have been said at St John the Baptist Church in the Shrub End part of the town, which is served from St Teresa of Lisieux Church in Lexden.St John the Baptist Church, Iceni Way from Diocese of Brentwood, retrieved 23 January 2016St Teresa of Lisieux Parish, retrieved 23 January 2016 In 1891, a community Sisters of Mercy moved into the parish from Brentwood. In 1896, they built a school next door. =Extensions= Church hall In 1861, to make more space for the soldiers in the increasing number in the congregation, the church organ was removed from the church gallery. From 1902 to 1932, the parish priest was a Canon Bloomfield, who oversaw the enlargement of the church. In 1904 the north aisle and sacristy were added. In 1907 the south aisle was added. The architect for these additions to the church was Charles Edward Butcher. They cost ¬£2,000 and were paid for by Dean Lucas. In 1911 the church hall was built next door, with the architect being Canon Alexander Scoles, the son of Joseph John Scoles. It was opened by the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Francis Bourne. It was renamed as the Cardinal Bourne Institute. In 1975, the church was reordered. In 1987, stained-glass windows were added to the Blessed Sacrament chapel in the church. They were taken from a redundant church and were originally designed by Augustus Pugin. St Theodore of Canterbury Church, Monkwick, served from St James' Church Parish The nearby churches in and around Colchester are served from St James' Church: St Cedd and St Gregory's Church in West Mersea, St Joseph's Church in Mile End and St Theodore of Canterbury Church in Monkwick. Each of these churches has one Sunday Mass: St Cedd and St Gregory Church at 8:30am, St Joseph's Church at 9:15am and St Theodore of Canterbury's Church at 10:15am.

Where she is a professor of pharmacological sciences and neuroscience, and also the Sharon and Frederick A. Klingenstein-Nathan G. Kase, MD Professor. She is best known for her work aimed at providing mechanistic insight into the structure, dynamics, and function of G protein-coupled receptors using methods such as molecular modeling, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, enhanced molecular dynamics simulations, and rational drug design approaches. The Filizola laboratory's research has steadily been funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2005. As of 2016, Filizola is active in five research projects funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Education A native of Italy, Filizola received her bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry from the University Federico II in Naples (class of 1993), and earned her PhD in computational chemistry from the Second University of Naples in 1999, though conducting most of her doctoral studies at the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. She went on to pursue a postdoctorate in computational biophysics from the Molecular Research Institute in California, moving to New York City in 2001. Career Filizola joined the Department of Physiology & Biophysics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) as an instructor in 2002. She continued in this role at Weill Medical College (WMC) of Cornell University, also in New York City, until she was promoted assistant professor in 2005. She returned to Mount Sinai as an assistant professor in the Department of Structural and Chemical Biology, where she was later promoted associate professor (with tenure since January 2013), and then full professor in 2014. Following three years as co-director of the Structural/Chemical Biology and Molecular Design (SMD) Graduate Program, and one year as co-director of the Biophysics and Systems Pharmacology (BSP) Graduate Program, she was appointed dean of the graduate school of biomedical sciences at Mount Sinai in May 2016. Dr. Filizola has also served as grant reviewer for NIH and other agencies for over 10 years. Currently, she is a regular study section member of the Biophysics of Neural Systems (BPNS) study section of NIH. Awards and honors Filizola's awards and honors include the title of European doctor in biotechnology from the European Association for Higher Education in Biotechnology in Genova, Italy (1999), a National Research Service Award from NIDA (2002), The Doctor Harold and Golden Lamport Award for Excellence in Basic Research from Mount Sinai School of Medicine (2008), and an Independent Scientist Award from NIDA (2009‚Äìpresent). She is also a member of the Faculty of 1000 for Pharmacology and Drug Discovery since 2013. Research Filizola's research program is mainly focused on G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), which are the targets for about half of all currently used drugs. Special effort in her lab has been devoted to the subfamily of opioid receptors to discover/design novel painkillers with reduced abuse liability and other adverse effects. A second important line of investigation in the Filizola lab is on beta3 integrins towards the discovery of novel therapeutics to treat renal, hematologic, neoplastic, bone, and/or fibrotic diseases. To obtain rigorous mechanistic insight into the structure, dynamics, and function of GPCRs and beta3 integrins, the Filizola lab uses several computational structural biology tools, ranging from molecular modeling, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, molecular dynamics simulations, a variety of enhanced sampling algorithms, and rational drug design approaches. Much of the work is done in close collaboration with major experimental labs with whom we have established longstanding synergistic ties.
