Before the introduction of western culture and the religions that are now practiced in Alaska, there was a common spiritual connection made with the people to the land they occupied. The most common name for this connection is shamanism. Shamanism differs in every culture where it is practiced, in Alaska it is centered in the animals that are common in the area. Through the use of many myths, stories, and ceremonies these animals are personified and their spirits made tangible and in turn are deeply woven within the Native Alaska people today. It was through the shaman that the spirit world was connected to the natural world. A shaman in Alaska Native culture was a mediator, healer and the spirit worlds‚Äô mouthpiece. Although shamanism is no longer popularly practiced, it was and continues, to be the heart of the Native Alaskan people. Native American majority and plurality in Alaska boroughs and census areas Aleuts The religion of the former Aleuts was an offshoot of the prevailing shamanistic beliefs common to the northern Inuit (formerly Eskimo) and to the tribes of northeastern Asia. They believed in the existence of a creator of everything visible and invisible, but did not connect him with the guidance of the world, and paid him no special worship. As rulers of their entire environment, they acknowledged two spirits, or kinds of spirits, who determined the fate of man in every respect.Ransom, Jay Ellis. \\"Aleut Religious Beliefs: Veniaminov's Account\\". 1945, p. 346 The earliest Aleuts worshiped light, the celestial bodies, and even the elements. They also believed that there were three worlds, to which they ascribed being and action. The first world, highest world, has no night or evening, and many people live there. The second, or middle world, is the earth. The third is subterranean and called lowest world. The aboriginal Aleuts had no temples or idols, but there were holy or forbidden localities known as awabayabax. Here they made offerings to invisible spirits. Such holy places were found in every village, being usually a mound, or some prominent place or a crag, which women and young men were strictly prohibited from visiting, and especially from gathering the grasses for their basketry, or taking away stones. If any young person, either from audacity or curiosity, violated this restriction, such infraction was sure to be followed by terrible \\"wild\\" disease, speedy death, or at least insanity. Old men could visit these spots at certain times, but only for the purpose of making offerings. Among the past-tie Aleuts were both shamans and shamanism. They were considered to be the intermediaries between the visible and invisible worlds, between men and spirits, and the Aleuts believed they were acquainted with demonology and could foretell the future and aid sufferers. And though they were not professional obstetricians, yet as magicians their services were in request in cases of difficult childbirth. Shamans were the aboriginal specialists in dealing with the supernatural. They cured the sick, foretold the future, brought success in hunting and warfare, and performed other similar tasks.Ransom, Jay Ellis. \\"Aleut Religious Beliefs: Veniaminov's Account\\". 1945, p. 348 The old Aleuts related that long before the advent of the Russians, the shamans predicted that White men with strange customs would come to them from beyond the edge of the sea, and that subsequently all Aleuts would become like the new arrivals and live according to their habits. They also saw, looking far into the future, a brilliant redness in the sky like a great new world, called arialiyaiyam akxa, containing many people resembling the newcomers. Aleuts believed that death stemmed from both natural and supernatural causes. The dead were treated in a range of ways, including mummification and cave burial of high-ranking men, women, and children, burial in special stone and wooden burial structures, and interment in small holes in the ground adjacent to habitations. Spirits of deceased individuals continued to \\"live\\", although details of any notion of an afterlife or of reincarnation are scanty.Veltre, Douglas. \\"Aleut.\\" Encyclopedia.com. Web. April 14, 2011 Prior to contact, Aleut ceremonies were likely held in the winter. Through singing, dancing, drumming, and wearing masks, the people entertained themselves and honored deceased relatives. Social rank was likely bolstered through bestowal of gifts. Today, Aleut ceremonies are those of the Russian Orthodox Church. Athabaskan The shaman within this culture was the middle woman/man between spirits and the native peoples. Alaskan Athabaskan shamans guarded people against the effects of bad spirits. The shaman also diagnosed various illnesses and restored the health of those harmed by bad spirits. The shaman could also provide the valuable service of scapulimancy, which predicted the location of game when hunting was scarce.Native People of Alaska. Greatland Graphics, 2002, p. 92 An infamous bad spirit was the Giyeg. The belief was that people became sick because Giyeg thought about them. The shaman\`s job was to distract Giyeg or else the person died.Young, Caroline. Spirituality, health, and healing. Google Books, 2011, p. 5 Another well-known bad spirit was the Nahani AKA the woodsmen. The woodsman was believed to be the spirit of people who got lost in the woods. The human spirit was called the Yega and upon death, the Yega had to be properly guided to the afterlife. Athabaskans believed that human and animals were very similar in the past and their spirits communicated directly. If an animal was mistreated, then its respective spirit would wrack havoc on the lives of the offending Athabaskan. The lines of communication between spirits and Native Athabaskans were kept open using the shaman to translate. There are still spiritual beliefs about the connection between animals and humans prevalent in the Athabaskan culture. The raven is the most popular animal followed by the caribou, wolf and bear. Ceremonies were designated to protect, heal or cleanse. The energy generated by the people and more importantly the shaman dictated the connection with the spirits and effectiveness of results. A popular after-death ceremony being a potlatch, allowed for the shaman to offer a smooth transition to the yega of the deceased. Food, water, song and dance are all examples of goods offered to the yega. Being the revered medicine woman/man, the shaman could use their power for either good or evil. People both feared and admired the shamans because of their extraordinary abilities. The most evil of shamans wielded their control over people through use of puppets, sometimes using them to send out threatening messages.\\"Shamans\\", LItSite Alaska., accessed April 12, 2011. When Christianity\`s influence started spreading, shamans lost credibility. Among the last attempts to keep shamanism alive is said to have been perpetuated by two Barrow shamans. The two said they had received a message from above which stated that a new developing shamanistic religion was better for them than the white man\`s religion. This rumor gained them some fans for a time but eventually they lost out to Christianity. It is said that one shaman converted to Christianity while the other committed suicide. As a few points of interest, in the Dena ºina peoples' eyes the \\"white man\\" couldn't be helped by the Shaman because he was believed to have the soul of a deceased Indian within. Shamans had to demonstrate their powers in order to have credibility. Tales include flying through the air, being shot then coughing up the offending bullet etc. Three great Shamans among Athabaskans are; Otsioza of Nulato, Noidola\`an of the Koyukuk and Kedzaludia of the Kokrines-Tanana Mission group. Shamanism is one aspect of Athabaskan culture that is not being revived due to its controversial methods but there are those who still privately practice it. Haida To the Haida, the universe is composed of a multiplicity of interconnecting and overlapping layers. According to some, Haida once perceived the flat, circular Earth to be centred between a land above, supported by a pillar from the earth, and a watery underworld below.Bonvillain, Nancy The Haidas: The Millbrook Press, 1994. Print. Connecticut Certain interpretations of ·∏µ'aygang.nga, the Haida canon of ancestral oral histories that were recited across generations by professional story-tellers, show the origins of the modern Haida worldview, which remains convoluted and complex, involving interlaced layers of tangible and intangible reality.,.John R Swanton, Contributions to the Ethnologies of the Haida: AMS Press, 1905. Print., Haida Language Glossary: Skidedgate Haida Immersion Program, 2016. Print. Many Haida believe in a supernatural world in which everything embodies a spirit including animals, medicines, mountains, lakes, and caves. Haida make offerings of tobacco, birds‚Äô feathers and food to honour powerful supernatural beings and communicate with ancestors and ancestral guardians. Haida people honour the beings in supernatural and tangible realities through dances, songs, offerings, and private and public prayer. Dancing and singing is a way to express, teach, and learn about the world and the natural, supernatural and ancestral beings that inhabit it. Dance is a link to the supernatural world through which Haida can access and experience supernatural possession. In the past, should someone become possessed by an evil spirit, a sgÃ±aaga, a Haida shaman, could be brought to draw spirits forth from the body. Haida Rattle Some Haida people believe that they are protected by ancestral supernatural beings such as the bear, raven, and owl. They often depict these animals in their complex paintings, carvings, and tattoos, most recognizably in their carved totem poles which were made out of primarily Western Red Cedar trees. They pray, make offerings and strongly believe in their spirits' abilities to aid and protect them. In the past, the people relied on a sgÃ±aaga to help them contact and communicate with the supernatural world. In Haida tradition the rites and secrets of the sgÃ±aaga's vocation were secret, and often required hereditary connections as well as complex and strenuous rites of passage to attain. The skills of the sgÃ±aaga were often obtained through an apprenticeship. The individual (most often a male, but in rare cases female) was \\"called\\" to being his tribes sgÃ±aaga or the title was passed on from an uncle.Giraudo Beck, Mary. Shamans and Kushtakas. Anchorage: Alaska Northwest Books, 1999. Print. When the hopeful felt he had prepared enough, he entered into the woods for eight days with only an assistant, where he meditated and fasted. After those eight days, if it was truly the aspirant‚Äôs fate to become a sgÃ±aaga, he would fall into a trance (sometimes after falling into unconsciousness) and receive a message from the supernatural world. After regaining consciousness, the sgÃ±aaga and the assistant would seek out a land otter and cut out a piece of its tongue. It became an amulet, wrapped in a piece of his clothing and the source of his land otter power. After the hopeful had become a sgÃ±aaga, he continued his rigid discipline, by bathing in icy water, exercising and drinking Devil's club juice, a native species of ginseng, daily. Appearance was important to those who were sgÃ±aaga, they wore tunics that were soaked in seal oil, around their neck hung a necklace with animal claws and various carved amulets. The Haida believed that the sgÃ±aaga's hair was the source of his power, thus it was never touched and left to grow long and often uncombed. When the sgÃ±aaga performed ceremonies, his face was blackened with coal. If the ceremony required that he or she be naked, their long hair that sometimes hung to the ground covered their bodies. Tools that accompanied the sgÃ±aaga to complete his rituals were an oval rattle and hollowed out bone if disease needed to be blown away. Illness was believed to be caused by thoughts and behaviour that acted against nature, and was then called out by the sgÃ±aaga and then asked for the spirits to cleanse and heal the individual. The clairvoyant sgÃ±aaga could sense if the fierce Haida warriors could achieve victory over their enemies before the battle. Believing in reincarnation, if a member of the tribe should pass away, the sgÃ±aaga was able to predict which newborn child would inherit the deceased spirit. A reincarnated spirit is called xÃ±anjii. Working through the power of another spirit the sgÃ±aaga risked losing his own identity or being possessed by it, thus he changed his contacts and disciplines often. With the introduction of smallpox, who Haida call Haayhiilaas, western religion, and ultimately residential schools, and much of Haida worldview was destroyed. Missionaries came along with the fur trade to Haida villages and taught or forced Haida people to speak, read and write English.\\"Indian Missions of Alaska\\" Through the introduction of western culture Haida lost some of their own. Most notably was the loss of their language, now only about a dozen elders still speak Haida language.Sealaska Heritage Institute, Xaat K\`il-The Haida Language Before the missionaries Haida people kept remarkably accurate histories by memorizing the ·∏µ'aygang.nga word for word, reciting and passing them on through generations. Much of the ·∏µ'aygang.nga that survive or were recorded discuss events that could be over 14,000 years old, including events from the glacial era, like the separation of Haida Gwaii from the mainland. These events are frequently confirmed by archeological findings. But after the purposeful obliteration of Haida way of being, tradition, language, art forms, rights and title by missionaries and US, Canadian, state, provincial and colonial governments, much was lost. Today Christianity remains prevalent among Haida, and the Russian Orthodox missionaries came to the Southern Alaskan shore in the 18th century where small congregations are still active. Tlingit Shamanism has to do with the belief that the Shaman is a mediator for the spiritual world. Through various cultures the shaman‚Äôs role is different, in that of Tlingit culture the shaman is a healer and seer. The shaman performs various rituals, ceremonies, and helping with civil dispute situations. In most cases though to become a shaman it is inherited by a son or a grandson, due to the fact they‚Äôre already in possessions of the drums and tools needed. Not everyone can be a shaman, but if you have the ability to become a shaman you are almost always forced into it. Though Shamans are held with great respect, and esteem; they are feared because of their ability to speak with the spiritual world, and ability to use magic.The Tlingit Indians. University of Washington Press, 1956, p. 194-204. Tlingit Shaman The shaman is referred to as √≠xÃ≤t‚Äô . The way that the shaman looks in the Tlingit culture, wild, dirty appearance, with hair loosely hanging in strands, he is never touched by scissors or comb. A shaman has in his possession all kinds of decorative objects used throughout various ceremonies and rituals. For each spirit the shaman has a special mask, which he uses when he appeals to that spirit. To conjure a spirit it may consist of a wild dance around the fire during which violent contortions of the body take place. The shaman can cure the sickness out of someone by driving out the evil spirits, bring good weather, and brings about large fish runs. For services such as these he collects a good amount of pay, and in fact he always gets it in advance. When a shaman passes, his burial is also different from that of all other Tlingit. The body of a shaman is not ever supposed to decompose because one of his first spirits stay with him, so it dries like a dried salmon. Every Tlingit has his own guardian spirit called \\"tu kinaay√©ik\\" (tu = their, kinaa = above, y√©ik = spirit helper) an evil or unclean person is deserted by his spirit. All spirits like cleanliness, the sound of the drum and rattle. A shaman who wishes to summon the spirits must practice alone for three to twelve months and the house in which the performance is to take place must be carefully cleaned as well as the songs and the dances. Another duty of the shaman in Tlingit society is to exposes witches. Witches, both men and women, are called \\"naakws‚Äôaat√≠\\" (master of medicine) and are supposed to have learned their skills from Raven while he lived on Earth. A witch is someone who harms another through magic, or are a source of illness. The shaman helps the person who is the victim of this witchcraft by thoroughly cleaning their house, and finding their belongings that the witch stole to perform this act. The ability of a shaman depends on the amount of spirits under his control and if he is a good shaman he can prosper, but if he does not maintain proper rapport with these spirits they might kill him. Every shaman in the Tlingit culture has his own spirits for whom there are special names and songs. He rarely inherits the spirits of ancestors, but they do occasionally appear to him and then the shaman makes a practice of entertaining them. Another belief is that the shaman has the power to throw his spirits into anyone who does not believe in him; and these people faint, or gets cramps. A shaman can bring better weather, the shaman will go into the water; if his hair gets wet, it will rain.

It was carried out by Israeli paratroopers and Shayetet 13 naval commandos, who took control of the island for over a day before leaving with 62 captured Egyptian soldiers and radar equipment. Background Egypt had launched the War of Attrition in order to weaken Israel's hold on the territories in the Sinai it had captured during the 1967 Six-Day War. While the war raged mainly along the Suez Canal, Israel hoped to secure a ceasefire by showing Cairo that it could strike anywhere in Egypt and by presenting the Egyptian leadership with the prospect of an all out conflict for which Egypt was likely ill-prepared. Refusing to limit the war to the canal front, in January 1970 Israel launched Operation Priha, a series of Israeli Air Force (IAF) strikes against targets in the Egyptian heartland, while its ground forces were tasked with a strike at the isolated and lightly garrisoned Shadwan. The aim of the raid was to capture Egyptian POWs to be exchanged for Israeli prisoners in Egypt, and to sabotage a local radar post which was deemed a threat to Israeli shipping in the Gulf of Suez. The task of taking Shadwan was assigned to the IDF's Paratroopers Brigade under the command of Haim Nadal. Its 202nd Battalion, commanded by Lt. Colonel Ya'acov Hasdai, and the brigade's elite reconnaissance company (Sayeret Tzanhanim), commanded by Captain Motti Paz, were to land on the island. These were to be assisted Shayetet-13 operators, while additional paratroops were to be at hand at Sharm el-Sheikh and on nearby Israeli Navy vessels. The Egyptian garrison on Shadwan was headquartered in the island's lighthouse, at its southern tip. The lighthouse was defended by a fortified perimeter consisting of 9 outlying outposts and manned by a company of Egyptian Sa'ka Forces commandos. In all, 100 Egyptian soldiers were present on Shadwan, of which 60 were commandos and the rest Egyptian Navy and technical personnel. Battle Operation Rhodes commenced on the morning of January 22, 1970, with a strike by twelve 109 and 115 Squadrons A-4 Skyhawks which killed a number of Egyptian soldiers, including the officer commanding of the local garrison. With the defenders thus engaged, Israeli ground forces started landing on Shadwan, ferried to the island by a pair of Bell 205s and 114 Squadron's fleet of Aerospatiale Super Frelons. Landing at 09:15, the forces disembarked a mile north of the lighthouse and broke up into various elements. Hasdai's battalion moved to capture the outposts on the island's eastern side and those leading to the lighthouse, fighting Egyptian soldiers who refused Israeli calls to surrender. Within an hour after landing, all but three outposts had fallen to the paratroops. One Israeli soldier, corporal Haim Isrovich, was killed by sniper fire. Paz's troops, attempting to flank the Egyptian forces from the west, met with resistance on the defensive perimeter's western side, only to enter a minefield. One officer, Lt. Israel Bat-Lev, was killed and several injured, and the force withdrew, leaving the posts codenamed \\"Dafna\\" and \\"Dvora\\" in Egyptian hands. At 10:30 the reserve force at Sharm el-Sheikh, led by Lt. Colonel Amos Yaron was therefore dispatched to the island. A force led by Lt. Yitzhak Kotler, meanwhile, arrived at the lighthouse. Despite expecting significant resistance, little movement was spotted at the site, and at 12:00 the Israeli troops stormed the building. A few rooms were initially found to be empty, but fire soon erupted from a building on the western side of the compound, hitting Kotler and leaving the force leaderless. Hasdai instructed one of Kotler's squad's to flank the structure and clear it out using grenades. By 12:57 these managed to secure the building, which was found to be defended by only a pair of Egyptian soldiers, one of which was killed and the other injured. An Israeli helicopter soon arrived to ferry both the Egyptian officer and Kotler to hospital, though the latter died of his wounds. Landing on the island at 11:30, Amos Yaron was dispatched by Nadal to overcome remaining resistance at the western edge of the island's defensive permiter. Leading a three-pronged assault, Yaron, aided by a pair of IAF strike aircraft, secured the post codenamed \\"Dafna\\" by 14:15. Nearby \\"Dvora\\" was soon secured as well and by 15:30 fighting had ceased. 14 Egyptians had been captured and 17 killed. Several dozen more POWs were found in subsequent scouring of the island. Air Force participation After their initial support of the landings, Israeli Air Force aircraft provided continuous close air support to the forces on the ground, while IAF fighters patrolled the airpace around the island to prevent Egyptian reinforcement. The operation also saw Israeli A-4s debut as aerial tankers, with 109 squadron providing inflight refueling for other Israeli aircraft on station. Egyptian Air Force Il-28 As the battle was underway, a mixed formation of two 109 Squadron and two 115 squadron Skyhawks spotted a pair of Egyptian torpedo boats heading for the island from Hurghada. The aircraft attacked the boats with air-to-ground rockets, sinking both. A slightly more successful attempt at intervention took place shortly after midnight on January 23, when a single Egyptian Air Force Ilyushin Il-28 bomber managed to evade Israeli aircraft on patrol. The aircraft made a single bombing pass but failed to cause any damage.Shalom 2007, p. 600 Evacuation Holding the island throughout the night, Israeli forces received the order to evacuate at 11:50 on the morning of January 23. All structures save for the lighthouse were demolished and the forces withdrew with 62 Egyptian POWs and a captured British Decca radar set. The last helicopter, bearing Haim Nadal, departed the island at 17:40. 3 Israelis had been killed and 7 injured, while Israeli spokesmen put the number of Egyptian fatalities at 70, including both soldiers on Shadwan and on the sunk torpedo boats. Aftermath Despite the operation's successful outcome, its aftermath was not as laudable. On January 24, two days after the operation, a truck carrying ammunition captured on Shadwan exploded while it was brought ashore at Eilat. 21 people were killed in the accident, although Palestinian militants attempted to claim responsibility for the explosion. Three additional deaths occurred in the following days.Norton 2004, p. 214 Egypt admitted to 80 soldiers killed, wounded or missing, but attempted to paint the Israeli raid in the best possible light. It initially reported that Israelis \\"attempted to land\\" on the island and had suffered 30 casualties and lost 2 aircraft, and later claimed Israeli forces failed to remain on the island \\"due to stiff resistance on land and massive air strikes\\". The Egyptian press focused on the actions of Captain Hosni Hamad, who had lost his life leading the torpedo boats to the island under his own initiative. Operation Rhodes had taken place a few days after the launch of Operation Priha, which had underscored Egypt's inability to counter Israeli aerial supremacy. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, rather than opting for a ceasefire, turned to the Soviet Union for military assistance. On the same day as Operation Rhodes, Nasser secretly left Cairo for Moscow for a series of clandestine talks. Within weeks, Soviet hardware and personnel began arriving in Egypt, signalling a new phase in the War of Attrition.

From 1972 to 1990, she operated to and from Douglas, Isle of Man. After a lengthy lay-up, she was sold in 1995, renamed Mary the Queen and operated as a ferry in south-east Asia, mainly sailing between Manila and Boracay. She was sold to Indian shipbreakers and beached in 2008.

The four were , , Mona's Queen and . Mona's Queen was the first diesel engined passenger ferry in the fleet. Slightly heavier than her two predecessors, Mona's Queen had accommodation for 1600 passengers, 55 crew, and approximately 100 vehicles. Vehicles were loaded through side doors positioned at various levels on either side of the ship. Mona's Queen was powered by two 10-cylinder P.C.2 Crossley Pielstick engines, producing 10,000 brake horsepower. Propulsion was by variable-pitch propellers ‚Äì the first time these had been used in the Isle of Man fleet. These meant she could be controlled from the bridge or engine room, with all engine conditions monitored from a control room within the main engine room.  Service history  Launched at Troon during Christmas week 1971, Monas Queen made her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Douglas on 9 June 1972, just missing the peak traffic of TT week. Mona's Queen gave reliable service to the Isle of Man from 1972 until 1985. She has two inaugural voyages to her credit, making the first car ferry trip from Douglas to Dublin in 1974, 133 years on from the first passenger service between the two ports, and in June 1976, Mona's Queen completed the first car ferry sailing from Fleetwood with 34 cars aboard.Island Lifeline (Connery Chappel) p66 Princess Alexandra Pier in 1983, approaches to Douglas could be particularly challenging during periods of strong south-westerly winds. After the merger between the Steam Packet Co. and the Manx Line in 1985, Mona's Queen was used mainly during the holiday season or chartered out. In September 1989, she was chartered by Sealink for the services from Portsmouth and Weymouth to Cherbourg. She was withdrawn from service on 3 September 1990 and laid up at the Vittoria Dock, Birkenhead. In December 1995, after a lengthy lay-up, she was sold to MBRS Lines (Manila-Banton-Romblon-San Agustin Shipping Lines) and renamed Mary the Queen. She sailed from Liverpool to the Philippines, covering 9,700 miles in 37 days. In Manila, she underwent an internal rebuild, converting her to a night ferry. Externally, the boat deck and bridge wings were covered, and several lifeboats removed. After the conversion, she operated mainly between Manila and Boracay. On 9 February 2004 on a voyage from San Augustin to Manila she caught fire off Sibuyan Island; the fire was extinguished within an hour. Mary the Queen was sold to Indian ship-breakers and beached at Alang on 1 September 2008. In 2011, MBRS lines put an ex-Canary Islands cruise ship formerly named City of Valencia into service as Mary the Queen, servicing routes formerly serviced by her namesake.

The line is long and was built between 1956 and 1959. Other Names Since 1956, the Nanping‚ÄìFuzhou railway has been referred to by at least four other names. The railway branches off of the Yingtan‚ÄìXiamen railway at the Waiyang station, near Nanping and is also called the Waiyang‚ÄìFuzhou railway or Waifu railway (). The Waiyang Station is located in Laizhou, a township of Nanping Municipality, and the railway is also known as the Laizhou‚ÄìFuzhou railway or Laifu railway (). In 2006, the Ministry of Railways, after upgrading the line for higher speed train service, joined most of this line with the Hengfeng‚ÄìNanping railway to create the Hengfeng‚ÄìFuzhou railway or Hengfu railway (). A short section of the line between the Waiyang station and Nanping station is now known as the Waiyang‚ÄìNanping railway or Wainan railway (). History The Nanping‚ÄìFuzhou railway was built between 1956 and 1959 using surplus funds and labor from the Yingtan‚ÄìXiamen railway. In 1956, as the Yingxia railway, the first railroad built in Fujian Province, was nearing completion ahead of schedule, the deputy governor of Fujian Liang Lingguang suggested using the leftover funds and manpower to build another railway to the provincial capital Fuzhou. The Fujian Party Secretary Ye Fei agreed with the proposal and secured the approval of General Wang Zhen. The Nanping‚ÄìFuzhou railway was completed by January 1959, and was the first railway connecting Fuzhou with the rest of China‚Äôs railway network. The single-track railway was electrified in 2000. When the high-speed Xiangtang‚ÄìPutian railway opened in 2013, it made possible much faster passenger service between Fuzhou and the interior of the country. Most of the passenger service between Fuzhou and Nanchang (and other points further north and west) has been shifted from the Nanping‚ÄìFuzhou railway to the new line, the older railway only keeping a comparatively small number of slower trains.

It is in Dohazari municipality of Chandanaish Upazila, Chittagong District.  History  The Mughal Subahdar Shaista Khan expelled the Arakanese from Chittagong in 1666 and established Mughal rule. After the Arakanese expulsion, Islamabad as the area came to be known, made great strides in economic progress. In 1666, Buzurg Umed Khan the son of the Subahdar Shaistha Khan led the invasion of the Mughal army as chief of the campaign to expel the Arakanese.In this invasion against the Arakanese, there were thirteen Mughal army commanders, consists of both Mansabdars and Army Generals. They invaded Chittagong and won a vast territory starting from modern day Feni to Cox's Bazar. After the invasion the Mansabdars and the military force settled there to ensure the security and ruling of the territory. One Mansabdar among them was Rajkumar Lakhsman Singh Hazari. His original name was Lakhsman Singh, he was a Gaur Rajput Prince and came from one of the Suryavanshi lineage Rajput ruling family of Rajputana under Mughal territory. He was a Mansabdar of Umra/Omrah Hazari rank in Mughal Imperial Court (commander of two thousand cavalry and soldiers including artillery) and this designation title, Hazari was added with his name. Rajkumar Lakhsman Singh and a mughal general Adhu Khan's joint force were responsible for the conquest of the southern area, they made their conquest till Ramu, Cox's Bazar. After dividing the territory, Lakhsman Singh Hazari was awarded a Mansabdari of South Chittagong under Mughal authority, it was a territory starting from Hashimpur, few miles before of Dohazari to nearly the middle of Cox's Bazar. Lakshman Singh Hazari was the founder of Dohazari. He established a fort in Dohazari and Dohazari was the centre of his Mansabdari. It is said that Dohazari was named because there was an army camp of two thousand soldiers (fort & including areas), this was Lakhsman Singh Hazari's command post. On the other hand, another possibility for the naming was, the actual rank title of Lakhsman Singh was Do Hazari; which meant commander of two thousand soldier or sowar (cavalry). The similarity of the name indicates that Lakhsman Singh Hazari's title was used for naming this region. The Hazari Family or the descendants of Lakhsman Singh Hazari are still living in Dohazari; during Mughal period they were the hereditary Mughal Mansabdars of Dohazari with the title of Maharaj Babu and during British era they were the Zamindars of Dohazari. Now the Hazari Family own Hazari Estate, which is based on Land properties, Commercial Space, shopping centre, Housing estates and Industrial places. In social service activities, Hazari family donated and helped for establishing two schools, one college, mosque, temples at Dohazari. The family donated a large area of lands for establishing two schools and made strong role on establishing a hospital in Dohazari. Late Babu Bhagirath Singh Hazari was the pioneer of these social service activities. Lakhsman Singh Hazari was the founder of Dohazari and his descendant Bhagirath Singh Hazari was the pioneer and architect of making ‚ÄòDohazari‚Äô a city. Bhagirath Singh Hazari made the first attempt and made strong steps to make Dohazari a city. The family made a great influence for the development of the area, as a result, Dohazari is now the most influential business centre and a municipality of South Chittagong.  Transport  In 2011, it is the railhead for Bangladesh Railway, on an extension of the Akhaura-Laksam-Chittagong Line, in the direction of Cox's Bazar. In 2011, it is proposed to extend the railways by to Cox's Bazar.

It is native to the United States, Canada and northern Mexico and exhibits aposematism (warning coloration). It was first described by the German entomologist Toussaint de Charpentier in 1843. Description Dactylotum bicolor grows to an average length of about for males and for females. It is mainly black with distinctive reddish and yellowish markings, a pale green prothorax and pale green wingpads. The tibia of the hind leg bears six to eight spines. This species does not develop wings and is unable to fly. Three subspecies are recognised: * D. b. bicolor ‚Äì Northern Texas, New Mexico and Mexico * D. b. pictum ‚Äì Northern and eastern part of range * D. b. variegatum ‚Äì Southern Arizona and western part of range The coloring varies across the insect's range, with D. b. pictum being black with little red, D. b. variegatum having distinct red markings, and D. b. bicolor having a purplish or violet sheen to the background black color. Before the discovery of Dichroplus silveiraguidoi in Uruguay in 1956, Dactylotum bicolor had the lowest known number of chromosomes among grasshopper species, with seventeen acrocentric chromosomes. Distribution and habitat It is found in shortgrass prairie, desert grasslands, thinly vegetated areas and alfalfa fields throughout the western Great Plains of the United States (and southern Canada), southward to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and into northern Mexico. Biology Its eggs are laid in soft soil in several batches of about one hundred. These overwinter and hatch in late spring or early summer, with adults being present until September or October. There is a single generation each year. Although adult rainbow grasshoppers are polyphagous and feed on many species of plant, the nymphs feed entirely on Wright's false willow (Baccharis wrightii) in Arizona and New Mexico. It has been found that the nymphs orient themselves relative to the sun, positioning themselves around the bush so as to thermoregulate (keep their body temperature within an acceptable range). In the morning and evening they feed near the ground in full sun, but at midday they move to the shady center. At night they roost in upper branches of the bush, but this may primarily be to avoid ground-based predators. The insect's coloration was shown to be aposematic in an experiment of predation by little striped whiptail lizards. These brightly-colored grasshoppers were less attractive to the lizards as food than cryptically- colored Trimerotropis sp of similar size, even though the lizards were unfamiliar with the rainbow grasshopper, which was not present in their natural habitat. The lizards may previously have encountered other prey with warning colors such as stink bugs, seed bugs, or velvet ants. The rainbow grasshopper is also distasteful to birds.

It details the adventures of Lupo Alberto, a blue wolf. The protagonist of the comic book, Lupo Alberto, takes the shape of the common man who has a goal in life and a certain amount of bad luck. Alberto, a resident of the McKenzie farm, always tries to steal a hen named Martha (who is his girlfriend), but Moses, a sheepdog, is the obstacle to his plans and does everything to stop him. The conflicts between Alberto and Moses were the subject of the first strips of the series. Lupo Alberto made its first appearance in February 1974, with some strips published by Silvestri in Corriere dei Ragazzi, a 1970s magazine owned by Corriere della Sera. After a year, Dardo published the first series dedicated to this character. Since 1985 a series of monthly books has been released, following a short-lived series (composed of 8 issues) launched between 1983 and 1984.

It was part of the tornado outbreak sequence of April 19‚Äì24, 2011. The tornado, rated EF4 at its strongest point with winds exceeding 165 mph, was the strongest to hit St. Louis County or City since January 1967. The tornado moved through many suburbs and neighborhoods, damaging and destroying many homes and businesses. The worst damage was in the Bridgeton area, where a few homes were completely leveled. In its 22-mile track across the St. Louis metropolitan area, the tornado damaged thousands of homes, left thousands without power, and caused heavy damage to St. Louis Lambert International Airport, closing it for nearly 24 hours. The tornado crossed into Illinois and tore the roofs off of homes in Granite City before dissipating. Tornado summary The tornado initially touched down near Creve Coeur Lake around 7:55 p.m. and moved into Maryland Heights where it produced EF3 damage. The tornado continued eastward and reached EF4 intensity in Bridgeton where a number of houses were completely destroyed. Afterwards the tornado traveled parallel to I-70 and struck Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, blowing out numerous windows and peeling away a large section of roof. The tornado then moved into the Berkeley neighborhood where it continued to produce EF2 damage, tearing the roofs from several homes. The tornado continued on through several more neighborhoods, causing roof damage to a church and two businesses in Ferguson, one of which completely experienced total roof loss. The storm also produced extensive tree damage and some roof damage to homes as well as partially removing the roof of an elementary school. Damage along this entire section of the storm's path was rated EF1 to low-end EF2. The tornado continued toward the Mississippi River resulting in mostly EF1 damage to trees, however EF2 damage occurred in Dellwood where extensive tree and utility pole damage occurred and three homes lost their roofs. EF2 damage continued as the tornado crossed into Illinois where about a hundred homes were damaged, three of which lost their roofs, and numerous trees were uprooted and snapped.

History On 9 June 1775, two Spanish Naval explorers, Bruno de Heceta and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra anchored in Trinidad Bay. Two days later, on Trinity Sunday, 11 June 1775, Trinidad Head was claimed for Spain in the name of Charles III by Heceta, his men and two Franciscan fathers who erected a cross on the summit. When Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeno, Captain of the Portuguese ship \\"San Augustin,\\" discovered and entered the Trinidad Bay in November of 1595, he did not anchor for fear of hitting submerged rocks. Over the next 75 years, Spanish, Russian and British ships landed at Trinidad Head for sea otters, fresh water and refuge from storms. The harbor and Trinidad Head were mapped as part of A.D. Bache's United States Coast Survey under the direction of Lieutenant Commander William P. McArthur.

The total number of Soviet viewers was estimated at 33,100,000 people.  Plot  The film is set in the 1980s, when Soviet Naval Aviation Tu-16 pilots risk death to help stop an American submarine whose defective reactor threatens a nuclear meltdown. The Soviet Navy conducts military exercises in the Atlantic Ocean. Exercises of the US Navy are held in the same area. The main element of the American exercises is training for the attack on the Soviet squadron from a multipurpose nuclear submarine. A special Hughes computer is capable of launching missiles at targets previously programmed into warheads, without human intervention. The computer provides full automation of the launching process of guided missiles. However, to start it is necessary to unlock the control panel in the cabin of the submarine commanded by Turner. The crew of the air tanker under the command of Major Gennady Volk performs the usual task of aerial refueling of the reconnaissance aircraft in the exercise area. The commander of Northern Fleet aviation, Major General Pavlov, intends to select the most capable pilots for retraining for new aircraft. Curious about Volk, he replaces the co-pilot before departure. For some unknown reason, Volk nevertheless refuses re-training and further promotion, trying to advance the navigator of his crew, Sergei Skiba. The Tu-16 refuels reconnaissance aircraft, and at this time meets the American anti-submarine aircraft P-3 Orion, which covers Turner's submarine. It turns out that its commander, Major Armstrong, and Volk are ‚Äúold acquaintances‚Äù. Pilots communicate on the air. In the meantime, a state of emergency occurs on the submarine - reactor specialist Alan detects a leak in the reactor's cooling circuit. Turner intends not to surface the submarine and orders Alan to fix the damage. However, the failure cannot be fixed, and the submarine is forced to surface. She is discovered by the Soviet forces, but the Americans claim that everything is in order. Alan, who received the strongest dose of radiation, understands that help can only be received from the Soviet military. Therefore, he sneaks into the cabin of the captain and removes the lock from the fire control system. Then he rushes into the radio room and, having pushed the signalman out, sends the SOS signal. But when Alan tries to escape from the submarine on a raft, Turner kills Alan. Soviet reconnaissance aircraft are tracking the SOS from the submarine and recording elevated levels of radiation. After a meeting, the commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Spirin, decides to send a Tu-16 aircraft to the submarine, carrying a boat and a group of repairmen. They are to be delivered to the target by the plane of Captain Gremyachkin - Volk's second pilot. However, halfway to the target, Gremyachkin's plane encounters a strong counter-flow of air. He does not have enough fuel to complete the task. Only Volk's plane can refuel it, but then he will have almost no fuel left. In the end, Spirin orders Volk to \\"stand in a circle\\" and wait for Gremyachkin's aircraft. Meanwhile, the commander of the American squadron, Admiral Rink, receives information that Soviet forces sent a rescuer to Turner's submarine. Americans can not allow the Soviet military to get on the submarine, but they have no legal basis to prevent this. A plane from the United States cannot fly because of the weather, and Turner is 8 hours flying time away from Greenland. Therefore, Rink makes a decision - to disrupt the rescuer's refueling. When Volk and Gremyachkin start docking, Armstrong's plane appears next to it. Orion takes up position in front of Soviet aircraft and tries to prevent them from docking by directing turbulent jets from the engines towards them. Armstrong is sure of impunity - in neutral airspace, Soviet aircraft will not fire at him. However, Volk gives the order to prepare for precautionary shooting, and the crews manage to dock and transfer fuel. Gremyachkin's aircraft safely flies off. Volk accelerates, and nearly stalls Armstrong himself. Gremyachkin's plane reaches the target and drops the boat with repairmen. However, Turner refuses to let them on board and orders a sailor to give a warning burst of fire. Meanwhile, American sailors are trying to eliminate the malfunction, but a fire begins in the reactor compartment. The voltage drops in the computer's circuits, and the weapons officer orders to turn it off. This leads to a short circuit, and the computer issues a weapon system command to fire a missile salvo at Soviet ships, the target data having been entered during the exercise. The command to prevent the launch does not work, since Alan entered permission to launch from the captain's panel. Turner does not have time to turn on the lock again and the submarine launches two missiles at the Soviet squadron. Automatic reloading of weapons for a second salvo begins ... Soviet ships detect the incoming missiles. The SAMs on the flagship aircraft carrier Kiev destroy the missiles. Yak-38 aircraft take off from Kiev in order to sink the American nuclear submarine which fired the missiles. But Admiral Rink communicates with Spirin and convinces him to postpone the attack for 10 minutes explaining that the launch of the missiles is a consequence of a malfunction, the Americans themselves will sink the submarine after the crew leaves it. Spirin agrees with the words: ‚ÄúIf in 10 minutes they do not sink the submarine, then we will‚Äù. The crew is evacuated from the submarine, which goes to the bottom. The missile cruiser Kirov (065th) is ordered to take on board Soviet specialists. Meanwhile, Major Volk's aircraft runs out of fuel, in glide mode, it is approaching the coast. Skiba finds a solution - land on an old German advance airfield from the Second World War. The crew manages to do this. The plane receives minor damage, and the crew get off with light injuries. After some time, the whole crew meets at the apartment of General Pavlov. During the evening, Pavlov‚Äôs wife tells Volk's wife why he refuses to re-train on new aircraft: 8 years ago, Volk's missile carrier aircraft crashed on takeoff and caught fire. Skiba pulled Volk out of the burning plane, but was badly injured, almost missing a leg. After long-term treatment and effort from Volk, Skiba was allowed to fly, but only on auxiliary wing aircraft. However, Skiba himself this evening reports to General Pavlov about leaving to the reserve, freeing Volk from \\"obligations\\". In the epilogue, Volk takes off as the commander of a new Tu-142 anti-submarine aircraft.  Cast = Russian characters  * Boris Shcherbakov as Maj. Gennady Volk * Mihai Volontir as Capt.

Work  Accardi's earliest paintings were self-portraits, but her move to Rome prompted more experimental work. In 1946, she joined the Italian avant-garde movement. In the 1960s, Accardi started making her first paintings in black and white, focusing on monochromy, color, and shapes. The inspiration for her black and white paintings came from visiting Paris during her one- woman shows. There the contrasting static and energetic work of Alberto Magnelli and Hans Hartung inspired her to begin painting in black and white.

She also began using a clear plastic material called Sicofoil, which she describes as \\"like something luminous, a mixing and a fluidity with the surrounding environment: perhaps in order to take away the totemic value of the painting.\\" She used this material to make Tendas, or tents of clear plastic, which she adorned with painted forms.

Biography Clive Carey was born at Sible Hedingham, Essex, in 1883. He went to Sherborne School, and was a chorister in the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, before becoming an Organ Scholar at Clare College in 1901. He then entered the Royal College of Music (RCM) under the auspices of the Grove Scholarship in Composition, studying under Sir Charles Villiers Stanford (composition) and James H. Ley (singing). He had further study with Jean de Reszke in Paris and Nice. He made his London debut in a song recital in 1907, making an immediate impression. The Times commented that he had \\"a baritone voice of wide compass and attractive quality, which he produces in very easy manner and with an assurance that is by no means common in a young singer. His songs lay well off the beaten track ... the singer showed himself thoroughly at home in them all.\\" On 11 December 1907 he played Papageno in Mozart's The Magic Flute at Cambridge, in a performance he himself produced, in which the English translation by Edward J. Dent was used for the first time. He then sang in a considerable number of other operas. In 1911 Carey started collecting English folk songs in Sussex with Dorothy Marshall, and later in Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. World War I interrupted most of Carey's musical activities; he was a ward orderly in the Medical Corps in France, among other duties, although he did publish Ten English Folk Songs in 1915. Also in 1915, he began setting The Starlight Express, but Sir Edward Elgar was given the commission. After the war, he took part in Rutland Boughton's performances at Glastonbury. For the Old Vic Theatre, where he was based from 1920 to 1924, he produced and sang in The Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute (1920), and Don Giovanni (1921). He also toured at home and in Europe in the vocal sextet called The English Singers. Clive Carey became a teacher of singing at the RCM. His pupils there over a number of decades until his death in 1968 included: Edith Coates, Rita Hunter, Arnold Matters, Elsie Morison, Margaret Nisbett, John Noble, Alberto Remedios, Betty Roe, Eric Shilling, Joan Sutherland, Ava June and David Ward. In 1924 he was appointed Director of Singing at the Elder Conservatorium at the University of Adelaide in South Australia, and also appeared there in straight acting roles with a repertory company. He also collected Australian folk songs while he was there. He contributed an article on English folk songs to an Australian Theosophist magazine. He sang in some of Dame Nellie Melba's farewell concerts in 1927. He toured India and the United States on his return journey in 1927‚Äì28, singing MacHeath in The Beggar's Opera, and also appearing with a troupe of morris dancers. He then returned to the RCM, where he lectured and gave English folk song recitals. He married Doris Mabel Johnston, daughter of Samuel Johnson of Adelaide, in 1929. From 1932 he confined himself mainly to teaching and operatic production, but he also sang occasionally at Sadler's Wells, and in 1936 he appeared at Covent Garden as Master of the Chorus in Oedipus Rex. He was a member of the Sadler's Wells Management Committee after the death of Lilian Baylis in 1937. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Carey happened to again be in Australia with his wife, and they remained there for the duration of the war; he taught in Melbourne and gave song recitals. In 1945, back in London, he was appointed Director of Opera at Sadler's Wells. In the New Year's Honours of 1955, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Clive Carey was active in restoring the original intentions of the composers who interested him, by removing accumulated traditions in the performances of certain of their operas. This gave the performances he was involved in a freshness and vitality that had often been long lost. His compositions included a number of songs and incidental music. His incidental music to The Blue Lagoon and The Wonderful Visit were both heard in London. His song Rondel was sung by Elsie Suddaby at the 1930 Proms, and Melmillo was performed at the 1932 Proms by Steuart Wilson. Other songs include The Spring, Love on my Heart from Heaven fell, Alma Mater, The Liverpool Girls, I have loved Flowers that fade, In the Highlands, Villanelle, Triolet, Jenny kiss'd me, April Children and Three Songs of Faery. Clive Carey had personal associations and correspondences with E. M. Forster, Rupert Brooke, Edward J. Dent, M. R. James, William Denis Browne, Ernest Farrar, Percy Lubbock Letter of 9 April 1958. and other notable people. There is a large collection of his papers and letters in the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library. He died in London on 30 April 1968, aged 84. He and his wife, who also died in 1968, are buried at the Holy Trinity Parish Church, Claygate, Surrey. His obituary appeared in Vol. I, No. 4 of the Folk Music Journal, 1968.

He was the first president of the new B√ºrgerschaft of Hamburg in 1859 and dominated the politics of the Hanseatic state as first or second mayor between 1887 and 1899.  Life  Versmann was educated in the classical institutions of the city, Christianeum, where he established a lifelong friendship with the classical scholar Theodor Mommsen, and Johanneum until 1840. He studied law at the Georgia Augusta in G√∂ttingen and at the Ruperto Carola in Heidelberg until 1844 and settled as lawyer in Hamburg in the same year. Versmann came in contact with the ideas of liberalism during his studies and stayed with them throughout his life.  Politics  The lawyer was elected as a liberal member of the Hamburger Konstituante in 1848 but the restoration, supported and enforced by Prussian troops during the First Schleswig War, led to the removal of this body 1850. The next political engagement was the membership of the first Hamburg Parliament (B√ºrgerschaft) in 1859. The liberal politician became president of the parliament and stayed in this office until 1861, when he was elected as one of the 24 lifelong members of the governing Senate of Hamburg (senate). Versmann became second mayor for the first time in 1887.  Customs Union (Zollverein)  In May 1879, the imperial chancellor asked the Hamburg Senate to accede to the German Customs Union as provided for in Article 34 of the Constitution. The Senate rejected this, citing the effect on the city's maritime trade, especially with the new high external tariff of the Customs Union. Hamburg and the Freeport - Economy and Society 1888‚Äì-1914, by Peter Borowsky, publ Hamburg University Press, Hamburg, 2005; pp.110 and 114-115 Versmann came to the conclusion that any alteration of the existing state of affairs would severely impair the competitiveness of Hamburg. On April 27 1880 Versmann replaced Kirchenpauer as Hamburg's plenipotentiary to the Federal Council (Bundesrat) in Berlin. There, he carefully raised Hamburg's reservations concerning absorption in the Customs Union. Johannes Versmann\\" in General German Biography(ADB ) //de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Versmann,_Johannes&oldid;=2513155 Retrieved 4 May 2017 However, it became clear that an absolute opposition to Bismarck's plans on this matter would be pointless. On 29 June 1880, the Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Senate stating: > ‚ÄúHamburg has an opponent, who pursues his aims without recklessness, as long > as he considers them to be the right one, an opponent whom we naturally > cannot cope with, the opinion of which is not to be misjudged, whether it be > in a political or commercial sense‚Äù. It called on the Senate to negotiate with Prussia proposing a smaller free trade district, with facilities for Hamburg's export industry. The Senate was still largely against the Customs Union. Meanwhile, the public were under the impression that the chamber of commerce still wanted to maintain the status of Hamburg as a free port city. With this double-tracked approach ‚Äì public opposition and private concessions - Versmann and the Chamber of Commerce attempted to strengthen the Hamburg's position. In December 1880 and January 1881, Versmann, Senator O‚ÄôSwald and Hugo Roeloffs (First Secretary of the Deputation for Indirect Taxes) held \\"informational discussions\\" with the Prussian Superior Customs Inspector Klostermann and the Prussian Finance Minister Karl Bitter, then in April 1881 they started actual negotiations. On 25 May 1881 an agreement was reached, signed by Prussian Finance Minister Bitter and the State Secretary of the imperial Treasury, on the one hand, and Hamburg's Plenipotentiary Senators Versmann and O'Swald, and the envoy of the Hanseatic states in Berlin Dr. Friedrich Kr√ºger, on the other. It stated that Hamburg would join the customs union with all its territory, except for a free port district which it specified. For this district, Article 34 would still apply, thus the freedoms of that district could not be abolished without Hamburg's approval. On 3 June the Senate voted in favour, despite the opposition of Kirchenpauer, followed by the Burgerschaft (House of Burgesses) on 15 June. The agreement came into effect in October 1888, while Versmann was First Mayor. \\"The Last of the German Free Ports\\" The Times (London) 13 Oct 1888; p.8  Later life  Up to his old age, Versmann was active in the most diverse fields of public life; he was also first mayor again in 1891, 1894 and 1897. He died after a long illness on July 28, 1899.  Notes  External links  * Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie: Johannes Vermann, Vol. 54 (1908), pp. 743‚Äì746.

African zoologist and museum director. He was the only son of Harcourt George Barnard M.A. (Cantab.), a solicitor from Lambeth, and Anne Elizabeth Porter of Royston. Life and career Barnard was born in London. His first education was at a private school in Camberley from where he went to the Realgymnasium in Mannheim to improve his German. From 1905 to 1908 this unusually gifted and versatile scholar attended Christ's College, Cambridge, taking the Natural Sciences Tripos in Botany, Geology and Zoology. He also took the newly introduced courses in Anthropology, Ethnology and Geography. For the following three years he studied law at the Middle Temple, becoming a barrister in 1911. After a short spell as naturalist with the Marine Biological Laboratory in Plymouth, he joined the staff of the South African Museum in Cape Town in 1911 as a marine biology assistant. He became assistant director in 1921 and director from 1946 until his 1956 retirement when he was free to work on the molluscs. His D.Sc. was from the University of Cape Town with a dissertation on the \\"Distribution of Crustacea in South African Waters\\", and he eventually became a world authority on crustaceans. His other favoured field was the taxonomy and classification of South African fishes, a discipline in which he did important pioneering work. Stellenbosch University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1956. Barnard was a keen mountaineer and served as secretary of the Mountain Club of South Africa from 1918 to 1945, and it was by way of the mountains that he met the amateur botanist Thomas Pearson Stokoe who was to become a close friend and climbing companion.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa vol.2 Barnard's mountaineering interest first brought him into contact with the genus Colophon, and many species of the beetle, such as Colophon primosi, were named after his mountaineering friends. In 1915 he married Alice Watkins, and they raised a family of two children, a son and a daughter. Barnard died, aged 73, in Cape Town. Legacy Barnard is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of geckos, Pachydactylus barnardi and Rhoptropus barnardi.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Executive producer Steven Moffat created the Silence, intending them to be scarier than past villains in Doctor Who. Though the phrase \\"Silence will fall\\" recurred throughout the 2010 series of Doctor Who, the Silence were not seen until the 2011 series' opener \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\". Their origins are eventually revealed in the 2013 special \\"The Time of the Doctor\\". In creating the Silence shown in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\", Moffat drew inspiration from Edvard Munch's 1893 expressionist painting The Scream as well as the Men in Black. The Silence continues Moffat's trend of using simple psychological concepts to make his monsters more frightening. In this case of the Silence, their existence is a secret because anyone who sees them immediately forgets about them after looking away, but retains suggestions made to them by the Silence. This allows them to have a pervasive influence across human history while being difficult to locate or resist. Creation The Silence's appearance was partially based on Edvard Munch's painting The Scream. Producer Steven Moffat created the Silence. Actor Matt Smith, who portrays the Eleventh Doctor, called these aliens \\"the scariest monsters in the Show's history\\" and Karen Gillan, who portrays the Doctor's companion Amy Pond, commented that the Silence could \\"rival the Weeping Angels in terms of scariness\\". The Silence shown in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" are depicted as tall humanoids with bulbous heads and mouthless, bony faces, partly inspired by Edvard Munch's The Scream. Their eyes are sunken within their sockets and the skin of their cheeks stretches to the point of their narrow chins. Their large, shrivelled hands resemble a human hand except where the ring and middle fingers would be is a large flipper-like finger. They speak in low, guttural voices though they have no apparent mouths. Aliens affiliated with The Silence seen to date in the series have been dressed in black business suits with an unusual texture. They are partly inspired by mythological figures known as \\"men in black\\" that became popular amongst UFO conspiracy theorists during the 1950s and 60s, as well as grey aliens. The four-fingered hands of the Silence, with one finger much longer than the other, were inspired by the aye-aye lemur. Reviewers have noted that, in creating the Silence seen in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\", Moffat again uses a psychological gimmick. The Silence are perceived only while being viewed; they are instantly forgotten once a viewer looks away. To keep track of their encounters with the Silence, Doctor Whos characters mark tallies on their bodies or use audio-recorder devices embedded in their hands to let them know if they have seen the Silence. Silence are portrayed as being able to gather electrical energy around them and shoot it from their hands. These Silence use the energy discharge from their hands to displace someone, leaving behind only debris in the form of ash like flakes. While absorbing and discharging this energy, a hole appears where one would expect a mouth to be. This power is enhanced and become more destructive if they combine their energy and use it together. The Doctor believed they had humanity go to the moon simply to create a spacesuit for their needs. Appearances The unexplained ominous phrase \\"Silence will fall\\" recurs throughout the fifth series of Doctor Who, in 2010. The plot thread is left open in the series finale, \\"The Big Bang\\", where the force responsible for the TARDIS' destruction is left unidentified. The Silence are then introduced‚Äîas a species rather than an event‚Äîin the sixth series' two-part premiere \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\"/\\"Day of the Moon\\"; one Silent observes the death of a future Doctor (Matt Smith) in Utah. Soon after, and unaware that companions River Song (Alex Kingston), Amy (Karen Gillan), and Rory (Arthur Darvill) met his future self and witnessed his death, the Doctor takes them to 1969, where they confront the Silence as they manipulate the US government. By recording a Silent saying \\"you should kill us all on sight\\" on a videophone‚Äîwhich the Doctor broadcasts during the Apollo 11 moonlanding‚ÄîEarth's populace is conditioned to kill all Silence, though they will not remember doing so. In the process, the Doctor's group meets a mysterious girl in the same astronaut suit as the assailant who kills his future self. Later in the series, this girl is revealed to be Amy and Rory's daughter, Melody Pond, who is also a young River Song. She is kidnapped as a baby, in \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", by Madame Kovarian (Frances Barber) in order to become a weapon against the Doctor‚Äîher Time Lord-like genetic traits make her an ideal candidate to kill the Doctor. \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" establishes that the Silence, and its Academy of the Question, has brainwashed her to such an end, though River goes against her programming and saves the Doctor's life. After biding their time until the conditions were right, Kovarian and the Silence kidnap River in \\"Closing Time\\", and force her to enact her role in the Doctor's death at Lake Silencio as seen in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\". In \\"The Wedding of River Song\\", many Silence appear in a parallel universe caused by River not shooting the Doctor. The eyepatches worn by Madame Kovarian and others are revealed to be \\"Eye Drives\\"‚Äîexternal memory units‚Äîpermitting associates of the Silence to perceive and remember the species. The Silence reveal, however, that they have the power to remotely kill the devices' wearers‚Äîas such, they betray Kovarian by killing her. The Silence is revealed to be a religious movement composed of the species of the same name. The religion takes its name from the prophecy that when the oldest question in the universe is asked, silence will (or must) fall. As the Doctor is predestined to answer the question (which turns out to be the show's name itself, \\"Doctor who?\\"), the Silence made it their goal to make his death a fixed point in time and prevent this. Though the Doctor's death at Lake Silencio was thought to be a \\"fixed point\\" of history, it turns out he faked his death, with River imprisoned for it so that the Silence will believe him dead. The Silence's origins are revealed in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013). They are genetically modified priests belonging to the Church of the Papal Mainframe; penitents would confess their sins and then forget their confessions immediately after giving them. During the hundreds of years of stalemate above the planet Trenzalore, where the Doctor refused to give his name lest he unleash the full horrors of a renewed Time War on the universe, the Papal Mainframe became known as the Church of the Silence, making the Doctor's continued silence its primary mission. During this period, the \\"Kovarian Chapter\\" of the Church is said to have split off and attempted to destroy the Doctor before he arrived on Trenzalore, as seen in Series 6. Their first attempt to stop the Doctor's arrival there is revealed to be the destruction of his TARDIS in Series 5. This action leads to the appearance of the cracks in the universe which brought the Church to Trenzalore in the first place. When the stalemate ends and Trenzalore is plunged into battle, the remaining Silence (who are loyal to the Papal Mainframe) fight alongside the Doctor to protect the planet's inhabitants from invading enemies, as noted by Tasha Lem. Together, the Doctor and the Silence defend the planet until everyone but the Daleks have retreated or burned.

Though he described them as \\"a standard Moffat psychological trick\\", he commended it as the \\"most refined to date\\" and praised an introductory scene that was reminiscent of the unsettling directorial work of David Lynch. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that though the Silence's central gimmick felt similar to previous ones, Moffat \\"continues to use those same tricks in such clever combinations, and with such technical flair, that I'm not tired of most of them yet.\\" The A.V. Clubs Keith Phipps wrote favourably of Moffat's handling of the species in \\"Day of the Moon\\". In particular, the introduction of a hand audio-recorder concept as particularly clever, as it allowed for developments in Rory's paranoia concerning Amy's feelings for the Doctor, although Phipps reflected that he was confused by the montage that connected the Silence to other mentions of \\"silence\\" in previous episodes. Following concerns being raised about whether the Silence had made Doctor Who too scary for children, Moffat responded by saying, \\"I emphatically think that's not the case ... children like to be scared‚Äîlike on a ghost train or a rollercoaster.\\" Some reviewers noted favourable comparisons with monsters from American fantasy series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Gentlemen from its critically acclaimed fourth season episode \\"Hush\\" (1999). Mike Moody for AOL TV wrote of the Silence, \\"They're pretty damn scary, and they remind me of The Gentleman from Buffy. (Anything that recalls Buffy is a plus for me.)\\" A Television Without Pity reviewer described the Silence as monsters which \\"look essentially identical to the Gentlemen from Buffy\\".

Law enforcement career While still in high school, Nazarian began his career in law enforcement as a student worker / Sheriff's Explorer under the tutelage of Sgt. Bob Warford and Deputy Arthur E. Pelino, Los Angeles County Sheriff‚Äôs Department, of the old Newhall Station. In the '80s, Nazarian became a prison guard employed by the California Department of Corrections. He was assigned to the California Institution for Women in Frontera, California, the home to several members of the Manson family, including Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten.

Shortly after leaving the California Department of Corrections, Nazarian went to work for the San Francisco Sheriff's Department as a deputy sheriff. Nazarian worked for the police department of Mendota, California, where he worked with juveniles.

Scaphonyx includes two additional species, S. africanus and S. australis, all of which are currently believed to be dubious. As noted by Langer et al.

In the 19th century, it was the site of a notorious French criminal scandal known as \\"the Red Inn affair\\". The owners of the inn, Pierre and Marie Martin, and their employee Jean Rochette were arrested in 1831 after a customer, Jean-Antoine Enjolras, was found dead by a nearby river, his skull smashed in. They were later charged with his murder. During the subsequent trial, numerous witnesses testified to other crimes committed by the accused, including up to fifty murders at the inn, and to aggravating circumstances of rape and cannibalism. There were rumors that the owners used to serve their intended victims meals containing cooked body parts of previous victims. The accused were only convicted of the murder of Enjolras, and were sentenced to death. They were executed by guillotine in front of the inn, with a crowd of 30,000 on-lookers. Subsequent scholars have raised doubts about the integrity of the trial. Today, the inn is a tourist attraction. History For about 23 years (approximately 1805-1830), Pierre and Marie Martin (n√©e Breysee), kept the inn. Originally poor farmers, they were said to have accumulated a fortune of 30,000 gold Francs (approximately 600,000 Euros in today's currency) by the time of their death. Pierre Martin was feared by his neighbours as he was a grasping, paid henchman of the local nobility, and had a forceful personality. The Martins were ultra-royalists; he had assisted nobles returning from exile to recover their land from the farmers on the cheap, and she had hidden a refractory priest. The political climate in France changed in 1830 with the overthrow of the ultra-royalist Charles X and his replacement by Louis Philippe: the Martins were no longer useful supporters of the regime but rather of its opponents. The peasantry of the Ard√®che were accustomed to collecting wood in the royal forests, but this had been curbed to protect the interests of sawmills. Sawmills began to be set on fire at night by bands of men who knew the terrain and had no difficulty in putting the gendarmerie to flight. Worried by this, the prefect had ordered that the rule of law must be restored In October 1831, a local horse-dealer, Antoine (Jean-Antoine) Enjolras (or Anjolras), went missing; a justice de paix (local magistrate), √âtienne Filiat- Duclaux, determined that Enjolas had visited the inn on October 12, 1831, whilst looking for a lost heifer and had not been seen since. On October 25, the magistrate arrived at the Martins' to investigate the disappearance of Enjolas, whose body was found next day on the banks of the Allier River a few kilometres from the inn, his skull smashed and his knee crushed. Pierre Martin and his nephew Andr√© Martin were arrested on November 1, 1831. The Martins' servant, Jean Rochette (nicknamed \\"Fetiche\\") - incorrectly described in romantic literature as a South American mulatto, but actually a (well-tanned) native of the Ard√®che) - was arrested the next day. Marie Martin was not arrested until later because the authorities did not believe at first that a woman could be a murderer. On June 18, 1833, the trial of the \\"four monsters\\" began at the court of Ardeche in Privas. The accused were linked to the death of Enjolas by the testimony of Claude Pag√®s, who said that Pierre Martin, Rochette, and a stranger had used a cart to move the body from the inn to the river.Claude Pag√®s died of fever on November 20, 1831, but his testimony was used in the trial. A local beggar, Laurent Chaz, testified in 'patois'; his testimony, as translated into French, was that on the night in question - unable to pay for a bed - he had been thrown out of the inn. He had hidden in a shed only to find himself witnessing the murder of a solitary traveller, Enjolas.\\"Meurtres en s√©rie √† l'Auberge Rouge\\" - Author unknown Serial killings at the Red Inn? More than 100 other witnesses were called to testify, mainly indirect witnesses relaying rumors of the time. The Code Napoleon permitted hearsay evidence to a much greater extent than Anglo-Saxon common law, but even so much of the evidence given was clearly inadmissible. Claims included:The interior of the Red Inn, now a museum. * The landlady would use the best bits of the corpses to make p√¢t√©s and stews for customers to eat * Certain farmers had seen human hands simmering in the cooking pot * Others reported having seen bed sheets or walls stained with blood * Others recounted that sickening smoke frequently came from the chimneys * The innkeepers would burn the corpses of their victims, including children, in the bread oven or pretend they were found dead from cold on the snow of the plateau Jean Rochette's lawyer implicitly accepted that his client was a murderer, pleading that Rochette was not responsible for the murders because he had been unable to break free of the influence of his masters. This plea contributed to the fate of the accused. Some historians think that the culpability of the Martins in the \\"assassination\\" of Enjolras is far from being proven, arguing that the latter simply died of a heart attack after having too much to drink, and that this would explain why Marie Martin tried to make him drink herbal tea. The summing-up of the president of the court was effectively a second closing speech for the prosecution; the argument of the defence, that Chaze was a drunken down-and-out whose testimony was implausible, was ignored. Verdict and Execution On June 29, after a hearing lasting 7 days, Andr√© Martin was acquitted; Pierre Martin, Marie Martin and Rochette were found guilty of only one murder, that of Enjolras, and were sentenced to death. After the rejection of their appeal, and of a plea for clemency to King Louis Philippe, they were returned to the scene of their crime in order to be guillotined in front of their inn by the executioner Pierre Roch and his nephew Nicolas. The execution took place on October 2, 1833, at noon as the bell of Lavillatte rang the Angelus. When Rochette was about to be executed, he cried, \\"Cursed masters, what have you not made me do?\\" The last words of the accused raised suspicion as to the true nature of the innkeepers. It was said that a crowd of approximately 30,000 attended the execution.Br√®ve sur l‚Äôex√©cution des trois condamn√©s, Gazette des tribunaux, 9 octobre 1833 Paul d'Albigny reports in his book about the Red Inn that, on the day of the execution, a ball was organized in front of the premises. The current building has been changed since 1831 and is now a tourist attraction in Ardeche, claiming the title of \\"authentic auberge de Peyrebeille\\". A terrace was built at the end of the farmhouse, which shelters a museum preserving the furniture of the time, though the decor has been subjected to some changes. To the east of the historic inn, a hotel-restaurant and gas station have been added. The French expression \\"ne pas etre sorti de l'auberge\\" (roughly equivalent to 'not out of the woods yet') is sometimes said to refer to the crimes at Peyrebeille but, whilst they gave additional point to the saying, it predates them.

Books L'Auberge rouge, a short story by Honor√© de Balzac, published in 1831, has no connection with the various events at Peyrebeille.The Crimes of Peyrebeille - 1885 lithograph (Fonds Biblioth√®que municipale de Lyon) Among the serious works which have reconsidered the case can be noted Peyrebeille by Felix Viallet and Charles Almeras which reaffirms the guilt of the Martins. L'Auberge sanglante de Peirebeilhe was a novel by that was inspired by various events that happened in 1885 and is illustrated by Jose F. Roy. prepared to publish in the journal Lyon R√©publican a serial \\"The Crimes of Peyrebeille\\", which was announced in a display by Jules Ch√©ret. L'Auberge rouge(CNRS √âditions), by historian Thierry Boudignon, challenges the official theory and suggests that the case of the Red Inn was a terrible miscarriage of justice based on rumors, dubious witnesses, and the need to \\"make an example\\". It is based on the documents from local and national archives, analyses the procedures of the instruction (preparation of the case), and shows that patois was an obstacle because the clerk of the court \\"interpreted\\" in French testimony given in patois, rather than simply translating what witnesses said. It concludes that the objective of the magistrates was to develop a convincing narrative in order to influence the decision of the jury. Facts forbidden by law were presented in order to discredit the couple; the inadmissibility of some evidence didn't prevent the legal system from using it to secure a conviction. On the same topic, L'Auberge rouge: l'√©nigme de Peyrebeille, 1833 (The Red Inn: The Enigma of Peyrebeille, 1833), a novel by , came out in 2003. It abandons the contemporary view that justice was done when the murderers were guillotined. Progressively, the author sows doubt, asking from the evidence reported in contemporary accounts, if this triple execution wasn't the biggest miscarriage of justice in the 19th century.

(, or George Gennadius Bizanczy, 1657, Nagyr√°k√≥c, Hungary ‚Äì 1733, Cs√°kigorb√≥, Hungary) was the bishop of the Eparchy of Munk√°cs from 1716 to his death in 1733.  Life  Yuriy Bizantsiy was born in 1657. He completed his studies in the Jesuit college of Nagyszombath and ordained as a priest in 1701. He was assigned as parish priest in Nagyk√°ll√≥, near the village of M√°riap√≥cs where an icon of the Virgin Mary wept in 1696 and again in August 1715. The succession of the eparch of Munk√°cs Joseph De Camillis, died in 1706, was problematic. Three pretenders were appointed: Yosyp Hodermarskyi appointed by the Habsburgs king Joseph I of Hungary, Petronius Kaminsky appointed by anti-Habsburgs Francis II R√°k√≥czi, and Ukrainian Polycarp Fylypovych appointed in 1709 by Rome. The solution arrived only in 1715: Kaminsky died, Hodermarskyi retired in a monastery and on 4 May 1715 the clergy elected Hennadit Bizantsiy, as suggested by the Latin bishop of Eger. His election was confirmed by the King of Hungary and later, on 3 April 1716 also by Pope Clement XI, who retracted the appointment of Fylypovych. At the time, the eparch (bishop) of Mukacheve was granted formally only the title of apostolic vicar in order to not to have two bishops, one Latin and one Greek Catholic, on the same territory. However Bizantsiy had to pay the support of the Latin bishop of Eger in his election: the eparchy of Mukacheve became subject to Eger bishop, who soon hampered his action. Only in 1771 the eparchy was made independent from the Eger bishop. Hennadiy Bizantsiy received the titular see of Sebastopolis in Armenia and was consecrated bishop on 21 December 1716 by the Metropolitans of Kiev, Lev Kiszka. In 1729 he joined the Basilian Order of which he became Archimandrite. In 1731 he stated the erection of the sanctuary of M√°riap√≥cs. He worked with success in strengthening the communion with the Catholic Church, and he succeeded to have always remembered by all the priests the name of the Pope into the Divine Liturgies. Gennadius Bizanczy died on 22 July 1733 in a monastery in Csernek, near G√¢rbou ().

Towards the close of the Bruce's reign, c. 1325, Ruaidhri mac Ailean was dispossessed for engaging in plots perceived to be against his king's interests.Gregory (1881) p. 25 Amie and Ruaidhri also had a brother called Ailean (Alan), about whom little is known.MacDonald (2008) p. 48 Edward Balliol may have restored these lands to Ruari's son and Amie's brother, Raghnall mac Ruaidhri, a state of affairs confirmed by David II c. 1344, who formally granted him Garmoran and the North Isles, although Lorn was retained by the crown and Lochaber in its entirety given to John of Islay, son of Aonghas √ìg. Shortly thereafter, in October 1346, Raghnall was assassinated at Elcho Nunnery near Perth, as the result of a quarrel with Uilleam III, Earl of Ross. Raghnall was the \\"last chieftain of the MacRuaris\\" and Amie was his sole heir.Gregory (1881) pp. 26-27Lee (1920) p. 82 Marriage, children and divorce The ruins of Teampull na Trionaid, or Trinity Church, which was re-built by Amie in the later part of her life John of Islay was also a descendant of Somerled via his father and thus a distant relative of Amie. By marrying this heiress to the Mac Ruaidhri lands he eventually controlled significant stretches of the western seaboard of Scotland from Morvern to Loch Hourn and the whole of the Hebrides save for Skye.Oram (2006) pp. 124-26 The marriage took place in the 1330s, probably in 1337.Lamont (1966) p. 25 From 1336 onwards John began to style himself Dominus Insularum‚Äî\\"Lord of the Isles\\", a title that implied a connection to the earlier Kings of Mann and the Isles and by extension a degree of independence from the Scottish crown.Hunter (2000) p. 127Oram (2006) p. 123 However, his ambitions were by no means quenched. He continued to build his power base by allying himself with Robert the High Steward of Scotland and the designated heir of King David. The marriage had by now produced three sons: John, Godfrey, Ranald,Gregory (1881) pp. 29-30 but John and Robert made an arrangement by which John divorced Amie and married Robert's daughter, Margaret Stewart. John is said to have obtained a papal dispensation for the divorce, which took place in 1350, just four years after Amie's inheritance. The Lord of the Isles now received Knapdale and Kintyre as a dowry but in return his sons by Amie were to be passed over in the succession in favour of any children by the marriage with Margaret. Later life Castle Tioram in Loch Moidart The \\"unvarying tradition\\" of the G√†idhealtachd recorded in the late 19th century was that Amie had given her husband no grounds for divorce and lived alone on her own estates until her death. The divorce annulled John of Islay's rights to her lands, although he managed to procure a royal charter to them in which her name is not even mentioned.Gregory (1881) pp. 30-31Oram (2006) p. 128 Amie was evidently of a pious disposition and built an oratory called Teampull Mhecael at the south-eastern point of Grimsay, and rebuilt the Teampul Chalumchille on Benbecula and the Trinity Church of North Uist.Thomas, F. W. L. (December 1871) \\"Notices of Three Churches in North Uist, Benbecula, and Grimsay, said to have been Built in the Fourteenth Century\\". Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. MacGibbon and Ross also attribute the building of the tower of Borve Castle, located to the south-west of the island of Benbecula, to Amie and dated the work to between 1344 and 1363. She is also said to have extended Castle Tioram in Moidart.Evans, Sandra \\"Eilean Tioram (The Dry Island) and Castle Tioram: Amy's castle\\". Moidart Local History Group: moidart.org.uk. Retrieved 22 April 2011. John of Islay kept to his agreement with Robert, now King in succession to David, and his children by Margaret inherited his title and the bulk of his lands. However Amie's son Ranald, who successfully petitioned for the return of much of the Mac Ruaidhri lands, including Garmoran and the North Isles, became the progenitor of Clan Macdonald of Clanranald and Clan MacDonell of Glengarry.Lee (1920) p. 50 Ranald acted as tutor to his younger half-brother Domhnall and was described as \\"old in the government of the Isles\\" on his father's death at Ardtornish Castle in 1386. He may have died in the same year, but the date of his mother's death is unknown. The descendants of Godfrey, Amie and John's eldest son, who was titled Lord of Uist, were known as Siol Gorrie. In 1427, Alexander MacGorrie of Garmoran (also called Mac Ruaidhri), who may have been Godrey's son, is recorded as being the leader of 2,000 men. Not long afterwards he was imprisoned in Inverness and executed for sedition by King James I.Gregory (1881) pp. 34-36  Notes FootnotesReferences * Gregory, Donald (1881) The History of the Western Highlands and Isles of Scotland 1493‚Äì1625.

The earliest documented mention of St George in England comes from the Venerable Bede (d. 735). His feast day is also mentioned in the Durham Collectar, a 9th-century liturgical work. The will of Alfred the Great is said to refer to the saint, in a reference to the church of Fordington, Dorset.Will of Alfred the Great, AD 873‚Äì888 (11th-century copy, BL Stowe MS 944), ff. 29v‚Äì33r. Charter S 1507 at the Electronic Sawyer Early (c. 10th century) dedications of churches to St George are noted in England, for example at Fordington, Dorset, at Thetford, Southwark, and Doncaster. St George rose to high popularity as a warrior saint during the time of the Crusades, but he had no special identity as a patron saint of England during the High Middle Ages. The saint most closely associated with England until the 14th century was Edward the Confessor. In 1348, Edward III gave St George a special position as a patron saint of the Order of the Garter in thanks for his supposed intervention at the Battle of Cr√©cy.\\"The first step towards the promotion of St George to a position of predominance seems to be due to Edward III, who in gratitude for his supposed help at the Battle of Cr√©cy founded the Chapel of St George at Windsor in 1348.\\" Perrin 1922, pp. 37f. From that time, his banner was used with increasing prominence alongside the Royal Banner and became a fixed element in the hoist of the Royal Standard. St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle was built by Edward IV and Henry VII in honour of the order. The badge of the Order shows Saint George on horseback slaying the dragon. Froissart observed the English invoking St. George as a battle cry on several occasions during the Hundred Years' War (1337‚Äì1453). Certain English soldiers displayed the pennon of St George. St. George's feast day in England was no different from the numerous saints on the liturgical calendar until the Late Middle Ages. In the past, historians mistakenly pointed to the Synod of Oxford in 1222 as elevating the feast to special prominence, but the earliest manuscripts of the synod's declaration do not mention the feast of St George. St George's Day was elevated to a \\"double major feast\\" in the declarations of the Province of Canterbury in 1415 and the Province of York in 1421,It was first introduced as a minor feast day observed in the Church of England in 1222, but its omission from later lists suggests that it was not universally adopted. Perrin, p. 38. but George was still eclipsed by his \\"rivals\\" Saints Edward and Edmund. Tudor period St George rose to the position of the primary patron saint of England during the English Reformation, with the revised prayer book of 1552. At this time, all religious flags were abolished, including all saints' banners except for his.\\"When the Prayer Book was revised under Edward VI (1547‚Äì1553), the festival of St. George was abolished, with many others. Under the influence of the Reformation the banners of his former rivals, St Edward and St Edmund, together with all other religious flags in public use, except that of St George, entirely disappeared, and their place was taken by banners containing royal badges.\\" W. G. Perrin, British Flags, Cambridge University Press: (1922), p. 40. The first recorded use of St. George's Cross as an English maritime flag, in conjunction with royal banners, dates to 1545.England (United Kingdom) ; Flags of the World; (c.1996 - Present) In 1606 it was combined with the Scottish St. Andrew's Cross to form the Union Jack. In his play Henry V, William Shakespeare has the title character utter a now-famous invocation of the Saint at Harfleur prior to the battle of Agincourt (1415): \\"Follow your spirit, and upon this charge Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'\\" At Agincourt many believed they saw Saint George fighting on the English side. The Cross of St. George was flown in 1497 by John Cabot on his voyage to discover Newfoundland and later by Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh. In 1620 it was the flag that was flown on the foremast of the Mayflower (with the early Union Flag combining St. George's Cross of England with St. Andrew's Saltire of Scotland on the mainmast) when the Pilgrim Fathers arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Early modern and modern history A Scout St George's Day Parade in Bristol, 1986. The rural tradition of Pace Egg plays, which feature Saint George as the character of the \\"hero\\", is recorded in the early 17th century. The tradition of celebration St George's day had waned by the end of the 18th century after the union of England and Scotland. The Royal Society of St. George was founded in 1894, dedicated to promoting English culture, including St George's Day. A traditional custom on St George's day is to wear a red rose in one's lapel, though this is no longer widely practised. St George was selected by founder Robert Baden-Powell as the patron saint of the Scout movement, and British scouting organisations such as The Scout Association continue to celebrate St George's Day. Most Scout districts host events on the Sunday closest to St George's day, often a parade and religious service for their members. Contemporary revival St George's Day festival in Kent. A certain revival of the position of St George as the patron saint of England has been observed since the mid-1990s. Notably, the Flag of England (the Saint George's Cross), which in the 1980s had mostly been reserved for political English nationalism, began to be displayed by football fans as representing England during the 1996 European Championships that were held in that country. The flag is now regularly used by fans at sporting events, and flown by churches, local authorities and other bodies.Conn, David; \\"Sour English stereotypes linger amid the flag-waving\\"; The Guardian; 12 July 2006 In parallel, a revival of St George's Day as an English national holiday has been encouraged by organisations such as English Heritage and the Royal Society of Saint George, partly in reaction to calls to replace St George as patron saint of England. A 2003 BBC Radio 4 poll on the subject revealed some interest in replacing him. A crowd celebrates Saint George's Day at an event in Trafalgar Square in 2010 On St George's Day 2002, the Campaign for an English Parliament protested at the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone's lack of support for St George's Day, while he announced plans to spend ¬£100,000 to mark St Patrick's Day by dyeing the fountains green in Trafalgar Square. The Campaign arranged to dye the fountains red on St. George's Day. From this effort, supporters privately organised a St George's Feast in London, the first of which was held in Covent Garden on 23 April 2003. The festival grew in size and importance during 2004 to 2008, including performances of traditional Punch and Judy shows, English folk dance Mummers Players, Morris dancers, English folk music, etc. The Royal Society of St George asked to contribute in the 2006 event, which was covered by BBC Radio 3. In early 2009, Mayor of London Boris Johnson led a campaign to encourage the public celebration of St George's Day. The event was first officially held in 2010, announced as \\"the first Pageant of St George in 425 years\\".\\"Pageant of St George returns to London after 425 years\\", BBC News 23 April 2010. The event has since developed as a major festival centred on Trafalgar Square and organised by the Mayor of London.Feast of St George 2016 (london.gov.uk) In 2011, a campaign to make St. George's Day a public holiday in England began on the UK government's e-petition website. It received 4,266 signatures, not achieving the 100,000 signatures required before the deadline in August 2012 to qualify for a debate of the matter in the House of Commons.

Early life Parry was the youngest of four children, and was born and brought up in Prestatyn in north Wales. He attended Penmorfa County Primary and Prestatyn High Schools, and his interest in photography began while he was very young: by the age of 13 he had learned to develop and print his own film using a darkroom set up by his uncle. He took photographs of people staying at the nearby Pontin's holiday camp during the summer holidays while still at school.

On 28 December he was returning to Britain and managed to find a place on an Antonov An-24 airliner operated by TAROM that was travelling out of Bucharest to Belgrade to pick up relief supplies. He took with him the undeveloped film from other photographers. The aircraft crashed near GƒÉe»ôti, 43 miles west of Bucharest, killing all on board. An inquest in November 1990 returned an initial verdict of accidental death.\\"Parry inquest\\", The Sunday Times, 18 November 1990.

With a shallow focus of , the earthquake was centred inland about west of Iwaki, causing widespread strong to locally severe shaking. It was one of many aftershocks to follow the 11 March T≈çhoku earthquake, and the strongest to have its epicentre located inland. The earthquake occurred as a result of normal faulting to the west of Iwaki, and triggered numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas. A few fires broke out, and 220,000 households lost electricity. Officials issued localised tsunami alerts, though no significant waves were generated. The earthquake caused little structural damage, but killed four people and injured ten others. The strong ground movements triggered the reactivation of a nearby geological fault, prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region. Geology The magnitude 9.1 Mw Fukushima Hamad≈çri earthquake occurred inland on 11 April 2011 at 08:16 UTC at a focal depth of , about west of Iwaki, Fukushima, or north-northeast of Tokyo. To the east of the epicentre, the oceanic Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate, on which much of Honshu's T≈çhoku region is situated. Building stress near the resultant plate boundary has led to the development of shallow inland faults through crustal deformation and folding along the east coast of T≈çhoku. This intraplate earthquake occurred in the vicinity of the Idosawa Fault - a shallow crustal fault in the Hamad≈çri region near Tabito town, Iwaki city, that had previously been inactive. Surveys near the epicentre revealed a surface rupture of about and numerous fault scarps, with general vertical displacements of ; a maximum displacement of occurred at the small village of Shionohira. Localised right-lateral slip of was observed at the subsiding west side of the rupture. The segments of the Idosawa Fault associated with this surface feature were classified as the \\"Shionohira Fault\\" in 2011. The nearby Yunodake Fault, a normal dip-slip fault northeast of the Shionohira Fault that had been dormant for 120,000‚Äì130,000 years, also ruptured during the quake. These observations indicated that the earthquake occurred as a result of normal dip-slip faulting with some strike-slip component. Although it was centred near a different fault zone, the earthquake was classified as an aftershock of the 11 March T≈çhoku earthquake, which occurred offshore about to its northeast. The magnitude 9.0 Mw earthquake triggered widespread seismic activity, and its aftershock sequence includes well-over 67 earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 Mw or greater. Apart from the Fukushima Hamad≈çri earthquake, four of the aftershocks measured magnitude 7.0 Mw or higher. The Fukushima Hamad≈çri earthquake, however, was the strongest of the aftershocks to have its epicentre located inland. Early estimates placed the strength of the earthquake at a magnitude of 7.0-7.1, but the United States Geological Survey (USGS) lowered the magnitude to 6.6. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed a magnitude of 7.0 Mj and a depth of . The Fukushima Hamad≈çri earthquake was succeeded by a number of smaller tremors; that same day, at least 11 earthquakes of magnitude 3.5 Mj or higher were recorded near its epicentre. Of the series, the strongest registered at a magnitude of 5.5 Mj and occurred within 3.5 hours after the initial quake. A shallow magnitude 6.0 Mw (6.4 Mj) earthquake and several smaller tremors struck the region on 12 April. Effects USGS shake map The earthquake struck in the late afternoon near a moderately populated region of the Fukushima Prefecture, although most structures around the epicentre were resistant to earthquake shaking. Focussed at an unusually shallow depth, the earthquake generated significant shaking throughout many adjacent prefectures. The strongest ground motion registered at severe (MM VIII) in Ishikawa town on the Mercalli intensity scale. Strong shaking (MM VI) spread through Iwaki, Sukawaga, Kuroiso, ≈åtawara and Kitaibaraki, with light tremors (MM IV) felt in areas up to several hundred kilometres from the epicentre, including Tokyo and Yokohama. The earthquake cut electricity to about 220,000 households, with most of the cuts reported in Iwaki city. Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant - distanced from the epicentre - evacuated to safety, and external power to the plant was cut. The outage briefly disrupted cooling water injections into three of the reactors, but services to the plant were restored by 18:05 JST. Authorities at Tokyo International Airport closed all runways momentarily, while NTT DoCoMo restricted voice calls in 14 prefectures following the quake. East Japan Railway Company temporarily suspended its services to restart four of five bullet-train lines; other Shinkansen bullet trains in the region were also halted. The earthquake sparked several fires in Iwaki, with one fire breaking out in Asakawa town. Fire engines extinguished a blaze in a liquefied natural gas tank at Daiichi Sankyo's Onahama Plant. Most of the structural damage was due to scattered rock- and landslides along hillsides in the vicinity of Iwaki. A landslide crushed two vehicles and buried three homes in the city, trapping a number of the inhabitants. The incident resulted in two immediate deaths. Four people were critically injured and taken to hospital; one of them was later pronounced dead. The Iwaki Ibaraki Route 14 interchange of the J≈çban Expressway, which runs from Misato, Saitama, to Tomiya, Miyagi, was cut off to traffic by a large landslide of . In Tabito town, very close to the epicentre, a landslide resulted in the formation of a quake lake - a natural damming of a river by mass wasting - with a water level of and a storage volume of 1,000‚Äì2,500 m3 (35,000‚Äì90,000 cu ft). Significant land deformation with traces of uplift was observed in and around town, affecting local roads but largely sparing its structures. A total of seven people from other regions near the epicentre, including southern Ibaraki, Tochigi and Kanagawa prefectures, suffered minor injuries. Another person was injured during the magnitude 6.0 (Mw) aftershock of 12 April. In a report from July 2011, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirmed a death toll of four from the earthquake. Response The Earthquake Early Warning system was activated upon the detection of primary waves - seismic waves that forego an earthquake's perceivable ground motions - giving residents 6.8 seconds to seek cover before the main shock. At the risk of a tsunami - which reach their destructive wave heights near shallow coastal waters - local fishing boats along coastlines were shown heading out to sea on national news broadcasts. A warning for a localised tsunami of up to was issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency; however, no significant waves were recorded, and the warning was cancelled soon thereafter. In response to the earthquake, the fire department dispatched search and rescue teams and emergency crews for relief efforts and damage assessments throughout the affected area. Six medical crews in pairs of two were also sent to Kanagawa, Chiba and Gunma prefectures. Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan postponed a press conference scheduled for 17:50 JST marking the one-month anniversary of the catastrophic T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The Fukushima Hamad≈çri earthquake occurred in a region with historically low levels of seismicity; studies showed that the recent activity near the fault zone had been triggered by the T≈çhoku earthquake. Ever since the earthquake triggered their reactivation, the Shionohira and Yunodake faults have provided essential data for local geological surveys on regional land deformation, sedimentary rock distribution and landslide vulnerability. In the earthquake's aftermath, Professor Yagi Hiroshi from the Faculty of Education, Art and Science noted that \\"a possibility exists for widespread aftershocks of the same size to occur in the near future.\\"  See also  *List of earthquakes in 2011 *List of earthquakes in Japan ReferencesExternal links * Japan hit with 6.6 aftershock ‚Äì CBS News * Earthquake M6.6 - eastern Honshu, Japan ‚Äì United States Geological Survey 2011 Fukushima Category:2011 in Japan Category:2011 earthquakes Category:April 2011 events in Asia ","title":"April 2011 Fukushima earthquake"},{"id":"31581476","text":"Air Vice Marshal Arun Kumaresan, RSP, USP, psc, SLAF was a Director Planning of the Sri Lanka Air Force.Defending the Nation from dizzy heights Educated at the prestiges Royal College Colombo, he joined the Sri Lanka Air Force as an Officer Cadet in the SLAF Regiment Branch.

She was built for the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). In 1948, she was sold into merchant service and renamed Granhill. A further sale in 1951 saw her renamed Baxtergate. She served until scrapped in 1960. Description The ship was built in 1944 by Shipbuilding Corporation Ltd, Glasgow. Launched on 19 August and completed in October, she was yard number 4. The ship was long, with a beam of . She was assessed at 7,072 GRT. The ship was propelled by a triple expansion steam engine. History=Second World War Empire Cowdray was built for the MoWT. She was initially operated under the management of the Alexander Steamship Company. Following completion in October 1944, two days of sea trials were held before the ship entered service. Following these, a cargo of coal was loaded at Hendon Docks. Once loading was complete, the crew were given a brief shore leave so that they could have a beer before the ship sailed to join a convoy. When it was time to sail, the crew ignored orders to return to their ship, not returning until being threatened with being put in jail. When the crew did return to the ship, they were too drunk to sail, causing the ship to miss the convoy. After they had sobered up, the crew were all fined for refusing the lawful command of the Captain and causing the ship to miss the convoy. Empire Cowdray joined Convoy FS 1623, which had departed from Methil, Fife on 1 November 1944 and arrived at Southend on Sea, Essex on 3 November. She then joined Convoy ON 264, which departed Southend that day and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States on 21 November. Empire Cowdray left the convoy to unload her coal at Baltimore, Maryland and then sailed to Philadelphia, where a cargo of grain and crated aircraft was loaded. She then joined Convoy UGS 63, which departed the Hampton Roads, Virginia on 11 December and arrived at Gibraltar on 27 December. She did not dock at Gibraltar, but proceeded to Bizerta, Tunisia, arriving on 31 December and leaving that day for Cagliari, Italy, where she arrived on 2 January 1945. Empire Cowdray was the first Allied merchant ship into Cagliari after Germany forces had left Sardinia. Several ships had been sunk as blockships and all the cranes in the harbour had been sabotaged. The ship was unloaded using her own derricks. There was no motor transport available so transport of her cargo was by horse and cart, which slowed the rate of discharge. Empire Cowdray departed Cagliari on 12 January for Algiers, Algeria, arriving on 14 January. She departed the next day for Gibraltar, arriving on 17 January, where she joined Convoy GC 110, which arrived at Casablanca, Morocco on 18 January. She departed Casablanca on 23 January, joining Convoy GUS 67, which had departed from Oran, Algeria on 22 January and arrived at the Hampton Roads on 14 February. Her destination was Baltimore, Maryland, where she arrived on 11 February. Empire Cowdray departed Baltimore on 3 March for the Hampton Roads, arriving the next day. She then joined Convoy UGS 78, which departed from the Hampton Roads that day and arrived at Gibraltar on 18 March. She left the convoy at Bermuda on 7 March. Two days later, Empire Cowdray departed from Hamilton, joining Convoy UGS 79, which had departed the Hampton Roads on 9 March and arrived at Casablanca on 23 March. Her destination was Port Said, Egypt, where she arrived on 1 April. Empire Cowdray then sailed to Suez from where she departed on 2 April, for Port Sudan to load a cargo of cottonseed and maize. She then sailed to Aden, arriving on 7 April. She departed Aden the next day for Colombo, Ceylon, arriving on 18 April and departing the same day for Madras, India, where she arrived on 21 April. On 30 April, Empire Cowdray departed Madras for Calcutta, arriving on 4 May. She departed Calcutta on 24 May for Bombay, arriving on 6 June. Empire Cowdray departed Bombay on 4 July for Louren√ßo Marques, Mozambique, arriving on 23 July. She departed Louren√ßo Marques on 3 August for Aden, arriving on 17 August and departing the same day for Suez, where she arrived on 23 August. Empire Cowdray then sailed to Port Said, from where she departed on 4 September for Alexandria, Egypt, arriving the next day. She departed Alexandra on 8 September for Freetown Sierra Leone. The war ended on 15 September and the crew were allowed a half pint of lager each to celebrate. She arrived at Freetown on 24 September. From Freetown, Empire Cowdray called at Gibraltar to replenish her stores. On the morning of departure, breakfast was liver, bacon and mash. The crew complained that the liver was off, and refused to eat it, demanding a meal before they would return to work. An offer of corn flakes was turned down. The ship's First Officer told the crew that they were committing mutiny on the high seas by refusing to sail. The crew pointed out that the ship was not on the high seas, so therefore they could not be committing mutiny. After intervention by the Captain, the crew were provided with a breakfast that satisfied them. During preparation for sailing, a crew member was injured in an accident whilst the rudder was being checked. He was taken off the ship by launch and taken to hospital. Empire Cowdray sailed to South Shields, County Durham, arriving on 15 October. Post-war In 1946, management was transferred to Goulandris Bros Ltd, London. On 29 July 1948, Empire Cowdray was sold to her managers and was renamed Granhill. In 1950, Granhill ran aground in the Weser at Bremen, West Germany. She was refloated undamaged. In December 1950, she loaded a cargo of timber at Lagos, Nigeria. Her boilers had been filled with river water at Sapele. On 7 January 1951, one of her boilers failed due to sludge. The ship was in the Bay of Biscay at the time. She had to be taken in tow and various expenses were sustained by Goulandris Bros. In 1957, the owners of the timber successfully sued Goulandris Brothers for ¬£22 10s 4d for losses incurred due to the late delivery of the timber. There was disagreement between the two sides as to whether the Hague Rules or York-Antwerp Rules applied. The judge deciding that the latter applied. In 1951, Granhill was sold for ¬£350,000 to Turnbull, Scott & Co Ltd and was renamed Baxtergate. In 1960, she was sold to the British Iron & Steel Corporation. Baxtergate arrived at Barrow in Furness, Lancashire on 1 December 1960 with a load of iron ore from B√¥ne, Algeria. After the cargo was discharged, she was scrapped by Thos W Ward, Barrow in Furness.

Those who came to the British Isles have been generally referred to as Vikings,Keynes 1999. p. 460.Richards 1991. p. 9. but some scholars debate whether the term Viking represented all Norse settlers or just those who raided.Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 3. At the start of the Early Medieval period, Norse kingdoms in Scandinavia had developed trade links reaching as far as southern Europe and the Mediterranean, giving them access to foreign imports such as silver, gold, bronze and spices. These trade links also extended westward into Ireland and Britain.Blair 2003. pp. 56‚Äì57. In the last decade of the 8th century, Norse raiders sacked a series of Christian monasteries located in what is now the United Kingdom, beginning in 793 with a raid on the coastal monastery of Lindisfarne on the north-east coast of England. The following year they sacked the nearby Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey, and in 795 they attacked again, raiding Iona Abbey on Scotland's west coast. Blair 2003. p. 55. Background During the Early Medieval period, Ireland and Britain were culturally, linguistically and religiously divided into various peoples. The languages of the Celtic Britons and Gaels were descended from the Celtic languages spoken by Iron Age inhabitants of Europe. In Ireland and parts of western Scotland, as well as the Isle of Man, people were speaking an early form of Gaelic known as Old Irish. In Cornwall, Cumbria, Wales, and southwest Scotland, the Celtic Brythonic languages were spoken, with modern descendants such as Welsh and Cornish. In the area north of the Forth and Clyde rivers, which constitutes a large portion of modern-day Scotland, dwelled the Picts who spoke the Pictish language. Due to the scarcity of writing in Pictish, all of which can be found in Ogham, views are conflicted as to whether Pictish was a Celtic language like those spoken further south, or perhaps even a non-Indo-European language like Basque. However, most inscriptions and place names hint towards the Picts being Celtic in language and culture. Most peoples of Britain and Ireland had already predominantly converted to Christianity from their older, pre- Christian polytheistic religions. In contrast to the rest of the isles though, much of southern Britain was considered to be part of Anglo-Saxon England, where Anglo-Saxon migrants from continental Europe had settled during the 5th century CE, bringing with them their own Germanic language (known as Old English), a polytheistic religion (Anglo-Saxon paganism) and their own distinct cultural practices. By the time of the Viking incursions though, Anglo-Saxon England too had become mostly Christian. The Isle of Man had supported its own agrarian population, but it is widely believed that it was Brythonic-speaking before Old Irish (later to become Manx) spread there. Gaelicisation could have taken place before the Viking age or perhaps during it, when the area was settled by Norse-Gaels who practised their own culture. In northern Britain, in the area roughly corresponding to modern-day Scotland, lived three distinct ethnic groups in their own respective kingdoms: the Picts, Scots and Britons.Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 5. The Pictish cultural group dominated the majority of Scotland, with major populations concentrated between the Firth of Forth and the River Dee, as well as in Sutherland, Caithness, and Orkney.Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. pp. 5‚Äì7. The Scots were, according to written sources, a tribal group which had crossed to Britain from Dalriada in the north of Ireland during the late 5th century. Archaeologists have not been able to identify anything that was unique to the kingdom of the Scots, noting similarities with the Picts in most forms of material culture.Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. pp. 14‚Äì16. The Britons were those dwelling in the Old North, in parts of what have become southern Scotland and northern England, and by the 7th or 8th centuries, these had apparently come under the political control of the Anglo-Saxons.Graham- Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 18. By the mid-9th century, Anglo-Saxon England was divided into four separate and independent kingdoms: East Anglia, Wessex, Northumbria, and Mercia, the last of which was the strongest military power.Richards 1991. p. 13. Between half a million and a million people lived in England at this time, with society being rigidly hierarchical. This class system had a king and his ealdormen at the top, under whom were the thegns, or landholders, and then the various categories of agricultural workers below them. Beneath all of these was a class of slaves, who may have made up as much as a quarter of the population. The majority of the populace lived in the countryside, although a few large towns had developed, namely London and York, which were centres of royal and ecclesiastical administration. There were also a number of trading ports, such as Hamwic and Ipswich, where foreign trade took place. Scandinavia Hugin Society in 8th century Scandinavia was, unlike parts of the British Isles, still pre-literate, existing in the final stages of European prehistory, known to archaeologists as the Iron Age. In Scandinavia, the 8th century proved to be \\"a period of rapid technological, economic and social development\\" which would lead the region out of the Iron Age and into what has come to be known as the Viking Age.Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 1. At the start of the Early Medieval period, the Norse populations saw themselves primarily as inhabitants of specific locations, such as Jutland, Vestfold and Hordaland. It would only be in the later centuries that the national identities would develop amongst the Scandinavians, dividing them into such national groups as the Danes, Swedes and Norwegians.Richards 1991. p. 11. The Late Iron Age peoples of Scandinavia had not yet been converted to Christianity as the peoples of Britain and Ireland had been, and instead followed Norse paganism, a polytheistic set of beliefs that revered such deities as Odin, Thor, Frey and Freyja.Graham- Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 32. Scandinavian society was heavily dependent on herring fishing, and when that failed, the seafaring Norse sailors turned to navigating around much of Europe during the Early Mediaeval period.Richards 1991. p. 12. The Norse populations of Scandinavia had developed trade links with many areas of Europe, obtaining large quantities of gold in the late 5th century, most of which had been found in Sweden, and to a lesser extent, Norway. Viking raids: 793‚Äì850 AD In the final decade of the 8th century AD, Norse raiders attacked a series of Christian monasteries in the British Isles. Here, these monasteries had often been positioned on small islands and in other remote coastal areas so that the monks could live in seclusion, devoting themselves to worship without the interference of other elements of society. At the same time, it made them isolated and unprotected targets for attack.Blair 2003. p. 63. Historian Peter Hunter Blair remarked that the Viking raiders would have been astonished \\"at finding so many communities which housed considerable wealth and whose inhabitants carried no arms.\\" These raids would have been the first contact many Norsemen had with Christianity, but such attacks were not specifically anti-Christian in nature, rather the monasteries were simply seen as 'easy targets' for raiders. The first known account of a Viking raid in Anglo-Saxon England comes from 789, when three ships from Hordaland (in modern Norway) landed in the Isle of Portland on the southern coast of Wessex. They were approached by Beaduheard, the royal reeve from Dorchester, whose job it was to identify all foreign merchants entering the kingdom, and they proceeded to kill him. It is likely that there were other raids (the records of which have since been lost) soon afterwards, for in 792 King Offa of Mercia began to make arrangements for the defence of Kent from raids perpetrated by \\"pagan peoples\\". The next recorded attack against the Anglo-Saxons came the following year, in 793, when the monastery at Lindisfarne, an island off England's eastern coast, was sacked by a Viking raiding party on 8 June. The following year they sacked the nearby Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey. In 795 they once again attacked, this time raiding Iona Abbey off Scotland's west coast. This monastery was attacked again in 802 and 806, when 68 people living there were killed. After this devastation, the monastic community at Iona abandoned the site and fled to Kells in Ireland.Graham-Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 24. In the first decade of the 9th century AD, Viking raiders began to attack coastal districts of Ireland.Blair 2003. p. 66. In 835, the first major Viking raid in southern England took place and was directed against the Isle of Sheppey.Blair 2003. p. 68.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle England Runestones The England runestones (Swedish: Englandsstenarna) is a group of about 30 runestones in Sweden which refer to Viking Age voyages to England. They constitute one of the largest groups of runestones that mention voyages to other countries, and they are comparable in number only to the approximately 30 Greece RunestonesJansson 1980:34. and the 26 Ingvar Runestones, of which the latter refer to a Viking expedition to the Middle East. They were engraved in Old Norse with the Younger Futhark. The Anglo-Saxon rulers paid large sums, Danegelds, to Vikings, who mostly came from Denmark and Sweden who arrived to the English shores during the 990s and the first decades of the 11th century. Some runestones relate of these Danegelds, such as the Ytterg√§rde runestone, U 344, which tells of Ulf of Borresta who received the danegeld three times, and the last one he received from Canute the Great. Canute sent home most of the Vikings who had helped him conquer England, but he kept a strong bodyguard, the √ûingali√∞, and its members are also mentioned on several runestones.Harrison & Svensson 2007:198. The vast majority of the runestones, 27, were raised in modern-day Sweden and 17 in the oldest Swedish provinces around lake M√§laren. In contrast, modern-day Denmark has no such runestones, but there is a runestone in Scania which mentions London. There is also a runestone in Norway and a Swedish one in Schleswig, Germany. Some Vikings, such as Gu√∞v√©r did not only attack England, but also Saxony, as reported by the Grinda Runestone S√∂ 166 in S√∂dermanland: {  :Grj√≥tgar√∞r (and) Einri√∞i, the sons :made (the stone) in memory of (their) able father. :Gu√∞v√©r was in the west; :divided (up) payment in England; :manfully attacked :townships in Saxony.Harrison & Svensson 2007:199Entry S√∂ 166 in Rundata 2.0 for Windows.  } Treasure hoards Various hoards of treasure were buried in England at this time. Some of these may have been deposited by Anglo-Saxons attempting to hide their wealth from Viking raiders, and others by the Viking raiders as a way of protecting their looted treasure. One of these hoards, discovered in Croydon (historically part of Surrey, now in Greater London) in 1862, contained 250 coins, three silver ingots and part of a fourth as well as four pieces of hack silver in a linen bag. Archaeologists interpret this as loot collected by a member of the Viking army. By dating the artefacts, archaeologists estimated that this hoard had been buried in 872, when the army wintered in London. The coins themselves came from a wide range of different kingdoms, with Wessex, Mercian and East Anglian examples found alongside foreign imports from Carolingian-dynasty Francia and from the Arab world. Not all such Viking hoards in England contain coins, however: for example, at Bowes Moor, Durham, 19 silver ingots were discovered, whilst at Orton Scar, Cumbria, a silver neck-ring and penannular brooch were uncovered.Richards 1991. p. 17. The historian Peter Hunter Blair believed that the success of the Viking raids and the \\"complete unpreparedness of Britain to meet such attacks\\" became major factors in the subsequent Norse invasions and colonization of large parts of the British Isles. Invasion and Danelaw: 865‚Äì896 From 865 the Norse attitude towards the British Isles changed, as they began to see it as a place for potential colonisation rather than simply a place to raid. As a result of this, larger armies began arriving on Britain's shores, with the intention of conquering land and constructing settlements there. England Norse armies captured York, the major city in the Kingdom of Northumbria, in 866.Richards 1991. p. 20. Counterattacks concluded in a decisive defeat for Anglo-Saxon forces at York on 21 March 867, and the deaths of Northumbrian leaders √Ülla and Osberht. Other Anglo-Saxon kings began to capitulate to the Viking demands, and surrendered land to Norse settlers.Starkey 2004. p.51 In addition, many areas in eastern and northern England ‚Äì including all but the northernmost parts of Northumbria ‚Äì came under the direct rule of Viking leaders or their puppet kings. King √Üthelred of Wessex, who had been leading the conflict against the Vikings, died in 871 and was succeeded on the throne of Wessex by his younger brother, Alfred. The Viking king of Northumbria, Halfdan Ragnarrson (Old English: Healfdene) ‚Äì one of the leaders of the Viking Great Army (known to the Anglo-Saxons as the Great Heathen Army) ‚Äì surrendered his lands to a second wave of Viking invaders in 876. In the next four years, Vikings gained further land in the kingdoms of Mercia and East Anglia as well. King Alfred continued his conflict with the invading forces, but was driven back into Somerset in the south-west of his kingdom in 878, where he was forced to take refuge in the marshes of Athelney. Alfred regrouped his military forces and defeated the armies of the Norse monarch of East Anglia, Guthrum, at the Battle of Edington (May 878). In 886, the Wessex and the Norse-controlled, East Anglian governments signed the Treaty of Wedmore, which established a boundary between the two kingdoms. The area to the north and east of this boundary became known as the Danelaw because it was under Norse political influence, whilst those areas south and west of it remained under Anglo-Saxon dominance. Alfred's government set about constructing a series of defended towns or burhs, began the construction of a navy, and organised a militia system (the fyrd) whereby half of his peasant army remained on active service at any one time. To maintain the burhs, and the standing army, he set up a taxation and conscription system known as the Burghal Hidage.Horspool 2006. p. 102 In 892, a new Viking army, with 250 ships, established itself in Appledore, Kent and another army of 80 ships soon afterwards in Milton Regis. The army then launched a continuous series of attacks on Wessex. However, due in part to the efforts of Alfred and his army, the kingdom's new defences proved to be a success, and the Viking invaders were met with a determined resistance and made less of an impact than they had hoped. By 896, the invaders dispersed - instead settling in East Anglia and Northumbria, with some instead sailing to Normandy. Alfred's policy of opposing the Viking settlers continued under his daughter √Üthelfl√¶d, who married √Üthelred, Ealdorman of Mercia, and also under her brother, King Edward the Elder (reigned 899-924). In 920 the Northumbrian government and the Scots government both submitted to the military power of Wessex, and in 937 the Battle of Brunanburh led to the collapse of Norse power in northern Britain.Richards 1991 p. 22 Edward's son Edmund became king of the English in 939. However, when Edmund was killed in a brawl, his younger brother, Eadred of Wessex took over as king. Then in 947 the Northumbrians rejected Eadred and made the Norwegian Eric Bloodaxe (Eirik Haraldsson) their king. Eadred responded by invading and ravaging Northumbria. When the Saxons headed back south, Eric Bloodaxe's army caught up with some them at Castleford and made 'great slaughter'. Eadred threatened to destroy Northumbria in revenge, so the Northumbrians turned their back on Eric and acknowledged Eadred as their king. The Northumbrians then had another change of heart and accepted Olaf Sihtricsson as their ruler, only to have Eric Bloodaxe remove him and become king of the Northumbrians again. Then in 954 Eric Bloodaxe was expelled for the second and final time by Eadred. Bloodaxe was the last Norse king of Northumbria.Panton 2011. p. 135. Norse settlement in the British Isles The early Norse settlers in Anglo-Saxon England would have appeared visibly different from the Anglo-Saxon populace, wearing specifically Scandinavian styles of jewellery, and probably also wearing their own peculiar styles of clothing. Norse and Anglo-Saxon men also had different hairstyles: Norsemen's hair was shaved at the back and left shaggy on the front, whilst the Anglo- Saxons typically wore their hair long.Richards 1991. pp. 11‚Äì12. Second invasion: 980‚Äì1012 Cnut the Great's domains, in red England Under the reign of Wessex King Edgar the Peaceful, England came to be further politically unified, with Edgar coming to be recognized as the king of all England by both Anglo-Saxon and Norse populations living in the country.Richards 1991. p. 24. However, in the reigns of his son Edward the Martyr, who was murdered in 978, and then √Üthelred the Unready, the political strength of the English monarchy waned, and in 980 Viking raiders from Scandinavia resumed attacks against England. The English government decided that the only way of dealing with these attackers was to pay them protection money, and so in 991 they gave them ¬£10,000. This fee did not prove to be enough, and over the next decade the English kingdom was forced to pay the Viking attackers increasingly large sums of money. Many English began to demand that a more hostile approach be taken against the Vikings, and so, on St Brice's Day in 1002, King √Üthelred proclaimed that all Danes living in England would be executed. It would come to be known as the St. Brice's Day massacre. The news of the massacre reached King Sweyn Forkbeard in Denmark. It is believed that Sweyn's sister Gunhilde could have been among the victims, which prompted Sweyn to raid England the following year, when Exeter was burned down. Hampshire, Wiltshire, Wilton and Salisbury also fell victim to the Viking revenge attack. Sweyn continued his raid in England and in 1004 his Viking army looted East Anglia, plundered Thetford and sacked Norwich, before he once again returned to Denmark. Further raids took place in 1006‚Äì1007, and in 1009‚Äì1012 Thorkell the Tall led a Viking invasion into England. In 1013 Sweyn Forkbeard returned to invade England with a large army, and √Üthelred fled to Normandy, leading Sweyn to take the English throne. Sweyn died within a year however, and so √Üthelred returned, but in 1016 another Norse army invaded, this time under the control of the Danish King Cnut, Sweyn's son.Richards 1991. p. 28. After defeating Anglo‚ÄìSaxon forces at the Battle of Assandun, Cnut became king of England, subsequently ruling over both the Danish and English kingdoms. Following Cnut's death in 1035, the two kingdoms were once more declared independent and remained so apart from a short period from 1040 to 1042 when Cnut's son Harthacnut ascended the English throne.

Batey noted that there was a lack of historical sources discussing the earliest Viking encounters with the British Isles, which would have most probably been amongst the northern island groups, those closest to Scandinavia.Graham- Campbell and Batey 1998. p. 2. The Irish Annals provide us with accounts of much Norse activity during the 9th and 10th centuries.Blair 2003. p. 64. The Viking raids that affected Anglo-Saxon England were primarily documented in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals initially written in the late 9th century, most probably in the Kingdom of Wessex during the reign of Alfred the Great. The Chronicle is however a biased source, acting as a piece of \\"wartime propaganda\\" written on behalf of the Anglo-Saxon forces against their Norse opponents, and in many cases greatly exaggerates the size of the Norse fleets and armies, thereby making any Anglo-Saxon victories against them seem more heroic.Richards 1991. p. 15. Archaeological evidence The Norse settlers in the British Isles left remains of their material culture behind, which archaeologists have been able to excavate and interpret during the 20th and 21st centuries. Such Norse evidence in Britain consists primarily of Norse burials undertaken in Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, the Isle of Man, Ireland and the north-west of England. Archaeologists James Graham-Campbell and Colleen E. Batey remarked that it was on the Isle of Man where Norse archaeology was \\"remarkably rich in quality and quantity\\". However, as archaeologist Julian D. Richards commented, Scandinavians in Anglo-Saxon England \\"can be elusive to the archaeologist\\" because many of their houses and graves are indistinguishable from those of the other populations living in the country. For this reason, historian Peter Hunter Blair noted that in Britain, the archaeological evidence for Norse invasion and settlement was \\"very slight compared with the corresponding evidence for the Anglo-Saxon invasions\\" of the 5th century.

In the south lies Umudioka and Ifite-Dunu, both in Dunukofia LGA. In the north, Nteje and Nkwelle-Ezunaka. In the east, Awkuzu and in the west, Ogbunike. The boundaries are naturally demarcated by streams except at the border with Nkwelle-Ezunaka where an expanse of Umunya heath namely, Oli- Omoto, Ogwugwu-Obo, Ugwueze, etc. crossed the Kpokili River. Nearly all ten villages of Umunya have their own fresh water springs. The town is blessed with fertile lands; hence, its economy is based on agriculture. It is a town of ten villages namely Ezi-Umunya, Okpu, Ojobi, Umuebo, Amaezike, Ajakpani, Odumodu-Ani, Isioye, Odumodu-Enu and Ukunu. These villages are sub-grouped into Ezi, Ifite and Ikenga sub-divisions, the tri-partite heritage of all Gadite H/Igbos commonly referred to in anthropological history as ERI-AKA Igbo.  Mythical and related (factual) history  The founder of Umunya is called Nya who was the son in-charge of the fleets of ERU, the progenitor of the Igbos of Guinea Forest West Africa. The story had it that River Omambala was joined by Isi-Ogwugwu, a fast flowing river that then encompassed the present Umunya area. Isi-Ogwugwu was believed to have created the rolling topography nature of the area as it is today. The scenic depression of Urunda towards Ogbunike is commonly cited by story-tellers, to credit this myth. The story goes that on a certain Eke day as Nya was ferrying fishermen and farmers across the stupendous Isi-Ogwugwu water course, he was struck by a moving flash in the river that followed an unusual wave swirl. The remarkable nature of the 'whirl and twirl' of the flash made Nya to suspend work in reverence to a river goddess, who he believed was passing to Eke market, in the west. As he went out to rest, he was shown a vision of a stone upon which he will establish a community of farmers who will become his own people. When he woke up, he discovered that the river had receded further beyond where he tied his canoe. This he took as a confirmation of his dream. He therefore settled here at the place known as \\"Ilo-Umuebo\\". This Ilo-Umuebo is now the center-court of High Justice in Umunya, where truth must be told. He brought his kinsmen and friends and founded the community known today as Umunya (UMU NYA/NNYA, i.e. ‚ÄúChildren of Nya‚Äù). Before the advent of the whiteman, probably in the 13th or 14th century, Umunya was decimated by invaders from Igbo inland. The first of the attacks was seen as a conspiracy from within and it was responsible for the whittling down of the precursor villages of Ezi sub-group namely, Adagbe- Mpo, Mponenem, Oviabuzo, Ezi-Oli and Okpuru. This incident bore hatred until commensal sacrifices were made through the Ana deity and Ana Priest, Nwakonobi installed to replace the people killed in the mayhem. By the turn of the 16th century, Umunya became introduced to the Nri installed style of Leadership with Igboegbuna Odezulu-Igbo Onenulu I, instituting the Hebraic Ozo Tradition. He brought a mystical piece of a \\"Lapis Lazuli\\" chunk originally kept by Nya himself and buried it to the foundation of his Obi at Umuebo. He became the first of the chieftainship of a warrior Dynasty that led Umunya until the 20th century, when the colonial authority established warrantship. The Ozo is a trend in the life of the people much like the practice of Jewish cabala. It becomes the repository of Umunya Tradition and Culture. Formerly, it was the exclusive reserve of the ‚Äúbold and prepared‚Äù men who were ready to keep the sublime truths, making them to be addressed as Nze (one who avoids evil). Umunya, like its neighboring towns, is organized into three socio-political divisions: Ezi, Ifite, and Ikenga. This form of organization is said to be a distinguishing feature of Eri-Igbo. In view of the near extinction of Ezi- Umunya, the elders of Umunya decided on a reorganization, grouping Okpu, Amaezike and Ukunu villages, all formerly of Ifite, together with the remainder of Ezi-Umunya into a village grouping to be known as Akanano. What remained of Ifite, namely Ojobi, Umuebo, Ajakpani and Isioye were thenceforth known as Okpoko, while Odumodu-Ani and Odumodu-Enu remained as Ikenga. The division of Umunya into three units‚ÄîAkanano, Okpoko, and Ikenga is both for administrative and defensive purposes. The warrant chieftaincy for Akanano was held by Chief Nwabude, for Okpoko by Chief Nwanegbo, and for Ikenga by Chief Oraegbuna. As a peace-loving community, Umunya has been blessed with good leaders beginning with the warrant traditional ruler, Chief Nwanegbo Okocha, whose reign was from 1909 - 1930. The first publicly crowned traditional ruler came 39 years later in the person of Igwe (Prof) J.C. Menakaya (Ezedioramma 1) who reigned from 1973 - 1985; followed by Igwe A. N. Nwanegbo (Ezedioramma and Okocha II) who reigned from 1994 - 1997, and the current Igwe, Kris C. Onyekwuluje (Eze-Nya 1) whose reign started in 1998. In terms of self-help efforts, Umunya community, though small in size and population, has made significant achievements. Several major projects have been undertaken and executed without government help. These include the construction of the health center, a modern post office, a community secondary school, a town hall, and a community bank. Only the electrification project was jointly carried out with the state government. In the field of commerce and industry, there is a functioning commercial bank (at the site of the defunct ACB Plc branch). The major industries are Tempo Mills Ltd (now known as Niger Delta Flour Mill Ltd), makers of Tempovita and flour, the U-Gas plant (now defunct) and a multi-million Naira bodycare, toiletries and domestic products manufacturing company, Hardis & Dromedas Ltd. There are presently two major markets, the Afor daily and the Eke weekly markets. A modern market is under construction. Many sons of Umunya have distinguished themselves in banking and in the civil service, while others have followed different professions or are distinguished academics. Reference: Floyd, B.

History Le Roys Bush was bought in 1918 by Edward Le Roy and named Urutapu. Edward established three ponds in which he grew water lilies and kept goldfish. He culverted streams to prevent flooding and piped the stream under the ponds, formed tracks through the bush and planted many native plants from Great Barrier and other parts of NZ. After his death in 1947, the reserve was purchased by a public subscription organised by Mr Prickett and members of the North Shore Branch of the Forest and Bird Society. The northern valley of Le Roys Bush was known as Te Uruwao (or Te Uruao) by early MƒÅori. The stream flowing through this valley forms a high waterfall. In 2015, the mana whenua were consulted on the establishment of a lookout at the head of the Le Roys Bush stream and advised the name of the stream was Te wai manawa. Extent Le Roys Bush (12 hectares) has been extended from the original block by addition of further purchases of bush-clad back yards. It extends from Highbury in Birkenhead down a valley between Birkenhead Point and Onewa Road, where it joins the Little Shoal Bay Reserve (7.5 hectares) and Lutners Reserve (2.6 hectares) near Wilding Ave in Northcote. The term \\"Le Roys Bush\\" is used generally to refer to the whole area including Little Shoal Bay and Lutners Reserves. Flora and Fauna The 1998 management plan lists the various species found in the reserve. Links to the plan and other information can be found at LeRoysBush.org.nz Infiltration of pest plants has been tackled by the Le Roys Bush Management Committee and contractors supported by grants from the Auckland Regional Council, Kaipatiki Local Board and the Birkenhead Trust/Lion Foundation. Rats and other predators are controlled by contractors in the reserve and by Beyond the Fence volunteers in the halo around the reserve. Kauri dieback has been identified as a problem; foot-cleaning stations have been established in the bush to reduce the spread of the disease.

Loveless is best known as a prolific full-forward in country football, mostly for Victoria clubs, starting at Latrobe Valley Football League club Sale. He would continue playing across the state until the age of 46, by which time he had amassed over 2000 goals, from no less than 16 clubs. After arriving at Footscray from Sale, Loveless put together just two games in the 1979 VFL season but became their regular full-forward in 1980.AFL Tables: Shane Loveless He had his best run of form mid-season, with eight goals in a win over Fitzroy and another seven against South Melbourne the following week. Another eight goal haul came soon after, against Hawthorn at Western Oval, and he finished the year with 44 goals. It was not enough to top Footscray's goal-kicking, which went yet again to Kelvin Templeton. With Loveless spending the season in the goalsquare, Templeton had been used as a centre half-forward and won the 1980 Brownlow Medal. Loveless was however Footscray's equal leading goal-kicker in 1981, with Jim Edmond on 25 goals, as Templeton was injured for most of the year. In 1982 Footscray recruited WAFL star Simon Beasley, who took one of the club's key-forward positions. As a result, Loveless was stuck in the reserves and despite good performances, was not able to earn a call-up to the seniors and decided to leave the VFL. He was recruited by Glenorchy for the remainder of their 1982 Tasmanian Football League campaign. A four-week suspension for striking Ray Riewoldt, uncle of AFL players Jack and Nick Riewoldt, meant he would play only a few TFL games.The Age,\\"Loveless out for 4 games\\", 20 July 1982 p. 36 For the rest of his career, Loveless was constantly on the move, setting new goal-kicking records as he went.

The park was originally opened as Chehaw State Park in 1937, and currently covers . The Wild Animal Park was designed by naturalist Jim Fowler of television's Wild Kingdom. Fowler is originally from Albany, Georgia. It was opened in 1997, and features boardwalks in the cypress swamps that take visitors through natural habitat exhibits. Chehaw was an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) from 1997 to 2018. It was previously one of only two accredited zoos in the state of Georgia. History Originally developed as Chehaw State Park in 1937, the property consisted of donated to the state of Georgia by private landowners in Albany, Georgia. It is enclosed on two sides by a large, clear water bayou formed where the Kinchafoonee Creek and Muckalee Creeks meet. The property has expanded to nearly and consists of moss-covered subtropical cypress swamps, climax hardwood forests, and burn-controlled pine/wiregrass habitat. The park is named for the Chiha, or Chehaw, a tribe of Creek Native Americans who inhabited around the property and befriended Caucasian settlers. Artifacts such as arrowheads, spearheads, tomahawks, hoes, drill, scrapers, clay pipes and stone celts were commonly found during original park development. Variations in artifact design show land use by distinctly different tribes over several hundreds of years.http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/georgiabooks/pdfs/gb0493.pdf In 1974, the city of Albany leased of unused land in Chehaw Park from the state of Georgia to develop a wild animal park where exotic and indigenous animals would be displayed in their natural habitats. With the inception of the wild animal habitat, the State donated the entire Chehaw Park acreage to the city to further develop. Albany and the Chehaw Wildlife Society commissioned Jim Fowler to design and supervise the construction of the wildlife area. The original animals were moved from the Tift Park Zoo in Albany to their new home at Chehaw between 1975 and 1977,http://www.tripwiser.com/trip_destination- Georgia_USA_Albany?itiNodeId=8ad198fc0cbeb4e4010cc483650f4743&eType;=site and the Chehaw Wild Animal Park was officially dedicated and opened to the public in October 1977. In 1979, the state of Georgia created the Chehaw Park Authority, an agent charged with the governing, preserving and developing the property as a natural and public resource for southwest Georgia. Park officials brought back the park's original designer, Jim Fowler, in 2004 to begin lending his expertise the development of the Wild Animal Park. At the same time, new exhibits were created for African black rhinoceros (opened in April 2005) and African lesser flamingos (opened in 2006). The park also retained the services of Atlanta design firm MACTEC Engineering to develop the first site management plan for the entire park.http://production.albany.ga.us/engineering/documents/SPLOST%20V%20Comprehensive%20Report%20June%202009.pdf Between 1997 and 2002, Chehaw began to examine other park venues including the construction of the two-million dollar Creekside Education Center, the Children's Play Park and a nationally sanctioned BMX bike track. Additional infrastructure construction included: animal quarantine, veterinary hospital, Savannah Caf√©, bathrooms, reptile house and ticket booth. Exhibits Chehaw is home to many endangered or vanishing species, including the red wolf, black rhinoceros, cheetah, black-and-white colobus monkeys, four species of lemurs, bongos, duiker, Grant's zebras, black bears, American bison, bobcat, Bactrian camel, several species of antelope, and unique birds (ibis, flamingos, grey crowned cranes, ostriches, bald eagles, and turaco). These exhibits are accessed through a boardwalk in the swamp area. The zoo also provides a home to native species such as fox, squirrels, beavers, bobcats, gopher tortoises, and white-tailed deer. The park also contains the following special attractions. * Ben's Barnyard: the petting zoo includes an interactive portion where visitors can see how they would fare next to wild animals. Zoo visitors can climb into a bald eagle's \\"nest\\", take a giant leap from a standstill into a sandpit, jump as far up as they can, and measure their \\"wing\\" span. * Alligator's Outpost: a boardwalk leads visitors to a swamp where dozens of American alligators live. Unlike most zoo exhibits, this one is a natural habitat where the challenge is to see how many eyes visitors can spy emerging from the waters. Zoo visitors can also feed the alligators on the weekends. * Wiregrass Express: the zoo's train, which runs through the pine/wiregrass restoration area. Visitors can take a 20-minute ride on this train during the months of March through December. * African Veldt: runs March through November and takes guests out on safari in a covered trailer. During the ride, guests will see several different species of antelope, zebra, wildebeest, ostrich, eland, and impala. The animals roam and herd freely in this 40 acre exhibit.

It was inaugurated on 11 August 1931. Among the residential halls of Dhaka University, Salimullah Muslim Hall holds a special status due to its heritage.  History  On 27 May 1912, the British government formed the \\"Nathan Committee\\" on establishing a residential hall-based university. The Calcutta University Commission recommended a hall for the Muslim students in order to maintain their own culture and religion. Based on the Nathan Committee's report and the recommendation of the Calcutta University commission, the government of India prepared the Dhaka University bill. The bill was passed by the Indian Law Assembly with the viceroy and governor general Lord Reading agreeing to the bill on 23 March 1920. Student enrollment at the university began on 10 July 1921. Dhaka University began with three halls: the Muslim Hall (Salimullah Muslim Hall), Jagannath Hall, and Dhaka Hall (later renamed Shahidullah Hall). The Muslim Hall was originally on the first floor of the Secretariat House. The largest room on the ground floor was divided into a dining room, kitchen, common room, library, and other rooms. In the first year of Dhaka University, the Muslim Hall housed 75 students out of a total of 178 Muslim residential and attached students. Associate Professor Ahmed Fazlur Rahman was appointed as Provost of Salimullah Muslim Hall. Two house tutors were also appointed: Fakhruddin Ahmed, who supervised the students, and Muhammad Shahidullah, in charge of religious instruction. During the 1922‚Äì23 session the number of residential students increased to 101. Eight additional rooms were arranged for the students. In the 1923‚Äì24 session the number of Muslim residential students rose to 127, and 61 rooms were allocated in the Secretariat House. Since the number of residents was increasing regularly, house tutor M.F. Rahman wrote a letter to the vice chancellor of the university. He noted that \\"the Mahomedan Community desired that a separate hall should be built for them; the University has agreed to spend a part of its capital grant and asked for a government loan. If this is done, the Community would be grateful; it will have the satisfaction that a suitable building has been provided for the Mahomedan young men who are the real trustees of their generation.\\" The university agreed to build a new hall and formed a building committee. The committee appointed the architect Gwyther to plan and design the hall. In 1927 the Bengal government provided funds to carry out the plan. During the 1930‚Äì31 session, the contractors Messrs Martin & Co. made considerable progress with the construction of the building. In the 1931‚Äì32 session the Salimullah Muslim Hall was complete. The hall currently houses more than 800 students. The renovation of the Salimullah Muslim Hall has been carried out regularly, with the most recent completed in 2010.  Architecture  The two-storey building faces south. It has four wings that surround a rectangular courtyard bisected north and south by a covered walkway. Verandas run along the inner facades, overlooking the courtyard. At the centre of the south wing, the projecting entrance has three pointed arches flanked by two square towers, each crowned with a bulbous yellow-tiled dome.

Binary decisions are basic to many fields. Examples include: *Truth values in mathematical logic, and the corresponding Boolean data type in computer science, representing a value which may be chosen to be either true or false.. *Conditional statements (if- then or if-then-else) in computer science, binary decisions about which piece of code to execute next.. *Decision trees and binary decision diagrams, representations for sequences of binary decisions.. *Binary choice, a statistical model for the outcome of a binary decision.. Binary decision diagrams A binary decision diagram (BDD) is a way to visually represent a boolean function. One application of BDDs is in CAD software and digital circuit analysis where they are an efficient way to represent and manipulate boolean functions. 241x241px The value of a boolean function can be determined by following a path in its BDD down to a terminal, making a binary decision at each node where a solid line is followed if the value of the variable at the node is true and a dotted line if it is false. A BDD is said to be 'ordered' if the order of the variables tested is fixed. A BDD is said to be 'reduced' if the two following conditions are true: * Each successor of each node is distinct. * There are no two distinct nodes of the same variable with the same successors. BDDs that are ordered and reduced can be called Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDD). An example of a ROBDD is the figure to the right, which represents the function f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=\\\\bar{x}_1\\\\bar{x}_2\\\\bar{x}_3+x_1x_2+x_2x_3. The order of the variables along any path is always x_1, x_2, then x_3, all nodes have distinct successors, and there are no two nodes of the same variable and the same successors.  Conditional statements  In computer science, conditional statements are used to make binary decisions. A program can perform different computations or actions depending on whether a certain boolean value evaluates to true or false. The if-then-else construct is a control flow statement which runs one of two code blocks depending on the value of a boolean expression, and its structure looks like this: if condition then code block 1 else code block 2 end 205x205pxThe conditional expression is \`condition\`, and if it is true, then \`code block 1\` is executed, otherwise \`code block 2\` is executed. It is also possible to combine multiple conditions with the else-if construct: if condition 1 then code block 1 else if condition 2 then code block 2 else code block 3 end This can be represented by the flow diagram on the right. If one condition is found to be true, then the rest are skipped, so only one of the three code blocks above can be executed. A while loop is a control flow statement which executes a code block repeatedly until its boolean expression becomes false, making a decision on whether to continue repeating before each loop. This is similar to the if-then construct, but it can executing a code block multiple times.

A Catalogue of One Thousand Named Galaxies (2010) and CNG. Catalogue of Named Galaxies: A catalog of galaxies for amateur astronomers proposing names in the style of traditional astronomical naming conventions.

This kind of configuration was researched by Aereon beginning in the 1960s and continuing until the 1980s. Several patent applications were filed, including a patent application filed in 1969.

The proof-of-concept aircraft for the Dynairship was the Aereon 26.

A lack of funding ended the project. According to Aereon, the Department of Defense told Miller in 2003, \\"You were 30 years ahead of your time\\"! Navy and Air Force research When it turned out that building the Dynairship under Aereon at that time was financially impossible, Miller went on to design very similar craft for research in the military field.

This massif is composed of a number of mountain ranges located on the left side of the Ebro river near Tortosa. The massive calcareous cliffs of the Serra de Card√≥ form the eastern side of the spectacular gorges through which the Ebro River winds its way in the final stage of its course, separating the Ebro Valley from the Mediterranean coastal area. The ranges cover an area of over 340 km2, extending from Rasquera in the north, to Benifallet in the south and eastwards through El Perell√≥ until reaching the Mediterranean Sea between L'Ampolla and L'Ametlla de Mar. Highway N-340 crosses the eastern side of the massif and Autopista AP-7 skirts the easternmost foothills by the seashore. All the ranges are part of the Catalan Pre-Coastal Range.

In the late 19th century the monastery was transformed into a spa, which became a very successful place among the Catalan elite until the Spanish Civil War.

Overview  Crowsley Park House Since the Second World War, Crowsley Park has been the site of a signals-receiving station used by BBC Monitoring, based until May 2018 at Caversham Park, three miles to the south. The Crowsley receiving facility is now an outstation of BBC Monitoring's new HQ at London's Broadcasting House. Crowsley Park House, an 18th century mansion house, sits in its own grounds within the estate and is still used as a private residence. Smaller houses on the estate ‚Äî South Lodge (at the main entrance to the park), North Lodge, Keeper's Cottage and Crowsley Park Lodge ‚Äî are also privately occupied. The main house is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England. In addition to the house, the stable and coach house and the grotto in the grounds of the house are also Grade II listed. Woodland on the eastern and northern sides of the park, known as Crowsley Park Woods, is leased to the Forestry Commission.James Paice, Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Parliamentary answer February 28, 2011 The remainder of the estate consists of wooded parkland used as cattle and horse pasture. Three (formerly four) very large (11-metre diameter) satellite dishes used by the BBC are on the north side of the estate. Until 2014, there were also many traditional radio aerials (antennas) spread across the park. The BBC leases the estate to private tenants, operating its receiving station from a modern building erected for the purpose near the centre of the park. Crowsley Park's history includes an association with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Location Despite being only north of the edge of the large town of Reading, and a similar distance southwest of the smaller town of Henley-on-Thames, Crowsley Park lies in a quiet rural setting, close to the southwest end of the Chiltern Hills. It is within the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The quietness of the location, especially the absence of electrical noise, was among the factors that drew the BBC to the site. In 2003, the hamlet of Crowsley became part of the newly created civil parish of Binfield Heath. Until then, both Crowsley and Binfield Heath had been part of the civil parish of Shiplake.Binfield Heath website Crowsley is about west of central London. BBC receiving station Crowsley Park and Caversham Park were acquired by the BBC during the Second World War. In April 1943, the BBC moved the headquarters of its Monitoring ServiceThe formal name was shortened to \\"BBC Monitoring\\" in the 1980s. from Wood Norton Hall, near Evesham in Worcestershire, to Caversham Park, with Crowsley Park acting as the service's receiving station, picking up radio broadcasts from Nazi Germany and many other countries. Shortwave, mediumwave and longwave receivers were installed in a rudimentary building at Crowsley put up some distance from the main house. The signals received were fed down telephone lines to Caversham to be listened to by monitoring staff. A more permanent building was later erected for the receiving station.

It was formally known as the BBC Engineering Measurement and Receiving Station. The Crowsley station was expanded to accommodate the equipment and staff transferred from Tatsfield. Following the merger, Crowsley was formally known as the \\"BBC Receiving Station\\" to reflect the range of work it did for various parts of the BBC (in addition to Monitoring) and other international broadcasters. This name is no longer used.

One of the two curtain aerials (which had been used for the relaying by the BBC of the Voice of America) was taken down.VOA shortwave transmissions from the USA were received at Crowsley and fed to the BBC transmitting station at Woofferton to be rebroadcast to their target audiences. The remaining curtain aerial was taken down in more recent years. With the decline in the use of shortwave in radio broadcasting, all of the Beverage and rhombic aerials were taken down in July 2014. In 2018, the BBC began a further modernisation of the facility, including the installation of 18 new satellite dishes.\\"New dishes required\\" Henley Standard, 19 February 2018 The modernisation coincided with the closure of the BBC's Caversham Park base and the transfer of BBC Monitoring's HQ to London.

The western path (starting from the main entrance), which is part of the southern extensionChiltern Society The Chiltern Way to the Chiltern Way, gives a clear view of the house. There is a distant view of the house, through an ornamental avenue of trees, from the public road junction at the southwest corner of the park.

The Census 2011 population details have been grouped with the parish of Slaidburn. Before 1974, it formed part of Bowland Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It covers just over 9000 acres. History Part of the Forest of Bowland, the historic township had two divisions‚ÄîLower and Upper Easington‚Äîwhich are geographically non-contiguous. Mystery surrounds the origin of these two divisions. From Norman times, Lower Easington formed part of the Liberty of Bowland, being a possession of the Lords of Bowland. Its manor was subinfeuded and by the thirteenth century was held by the De Wannervill family. Ownership passed to the Bannister family in the early sixteenth century, with the manor eventually being broken up and sold off piecemeal in the 1690s.CJ Spencer http://www.chrisspencer.co.uk/Manor_of_Slaidburn.html The manor sat due south of Slaidburn within the modern-day township of Newton-in-Bowland. Upper Easington is the larger of the two divisions and includes Dalehead and Stocks Reservoir. It abuts Gisburn Forest and marks the easternmost extent of ancient Bowland. To the north of Upper Easington sits the Cross o'Greet, the ancient boundary point and watershed between the medieval lordships of Bowland and Burton-in-Lonsdale, Clitheroe and Hornby; the route up to the Cross across what was anciently called \\"Gradale\\" is perhaps one of the most ruggedly beautiful in the Forest. It is thought that the lands of Upper Easington may originally have been part of the Slaidburn township but grants by the de Lacys to Kirkstall Abbey in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries gave the area its own distinctive identity.John Porter, The Forest of Bowland, Its Landscape and History (Farnborough 1994) The township of Rushton was granted by Robert de Lacy, 3rd Lord of Bowland, in 1180. This was to be the site of the area's monastic grange (now submerged beneath Stocks Reservoir). In 1220 or thereabouts, John de Lacy, 5th Lord of Bowland, granted an area west of the Hodder and north of Rushton known as \\"Gamellesarges\\". In Helen Wallbank's unpublished translation from the Latin, the description of Upper Easington from the grant of 1232‚Äì40 reads: Gradalehals is the 'grey dale' at the head of Cross o'Greet; Kesedene is Keasden Brook; Rowenumcnothes is Bowland Knotts; Hesbrithehawebroc is Hesberts Hill Brook (now known as Brown Hills Beck and, lower down, Dob Dale Beck); Thirnesetegilebroc is now known as Bottoms Beck, but was formerly known as Bridge House Beck, all these becks being names for the same beck at different locations.Slaidburn Archive For three centuries, Upper Easington remained Kirkstall Abbey's most westerly land holding before being forfeited by the Abbey in 1539.Guy D Barnes, Kirkstall Abbey, 1147-1539: An Historical Study (Thoresby Society: Leeds 1984), p. 18 After the Reformation, Rushton Grange was acquired by the Braddyll family of Whalley and thereafter by the Johnson and Wiglesworth families. The Wiglesworths later built their imposing mansion, Townhead, in Slaidburn. Charles Towneley, 13th Lord of Bowland, acquired the grange in 1860 before its eventual sale to the Fylde Reservoir Company.Alice Peel, A Short History of the Parish of Slaidburn (Beeley Bros: Lancaster 1922) The mesne manor of Hammerton also lay within Upper Easington until the time of the Reformation when the Hammerton family lands were confiscated by the Crown.RW Hoyle, The Pilgrimage of Grace and the Politics of the 1530s (Oxford University Press 2001) The manor was later held by the Greenacres and Breres families.T D Whitaker, The History and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven in the County of York, http://www.skiptoncastle.co.uk/craven-history/04_Parish-of-Sladeburne.pdf Historians continue to puzzle over the existence of two Easingtons. The Coucher Book of Kirkstall Abbey suggests the lands of the upper Hodder north of Slaidburn were not known as Easington in the thirteenth century, merely as \\"Bouland\\".WT Lancaster & WP Baildon, eds., The Coucher Book of the Cistercian Abbey of Kirkstall in the West Riding of the County of York (Thoresby Society: Leeds 1904), pp. 202‚Äì4 We might speculate that the manor of Lower Easington gained some influence over the area after the Reformation, with the civil administrative map being redrawn to reflect this change, perhaps during the seventeenth century. However, the evidence for this is slight, although a junior branch of the Bannister family was present at Newhouse, south of Catlow, from the early 1600s.CJ Spencer www.chrisspencer.co.uk In 2009, a rare limeburners' clamp kiln was excavated at Halsteads in Upper Easington which carbon dating suggests was last fired somewhere between 1205 and 1280. This approximates to the period in the thirteenth century when John de Lacy, 5th Lord of Bowland, gifted his lands to Kirkstall.Slaidburn Archive There is evidence of prehistoric settlement in Lower Easington: with Skelshaw Ring, a Bronze Age monument, lying due south of Slaidburn.Skelshaw Ring http://megalithix.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/skelshaw-ring/ Governance The civil parish of Easington was created from the township of the same name in 1866.

In 2005, whilst out with a group of friends, he slipped and fell eight feet on to a concrete path. Thinking that he had headed home alone, his friends left. When he regained consciousness two hours later, Aggar phoned for an ambulance. In his fall, he had broken his back and suffered a spinal injury, resulting in paralysis of his legs. Rowing Aggar took up rowing as part of the rehabilitation from his injury. He competed at the 2006 National Indoor Championships using a Functional electrical stimulation (FES) rowing machine, where electrical currents are used to activate nerves in parts of the body affected by paralysis. In 2007, at the World Rowing Championships in Munich, Aggar won the gold medal in the 1000 m men's single scull in 5 minutes 13.13 seconds.

Randolph Clay \\"Randy\\" Wood (March 30, 1917 ‚Äì April 9, 2011) was an American record producer and the founder of Nashville-based Dot Records, one of the most successful independent record labels of the 1950s and 1960s. Early life He was born in McMinnville, Tennessee, the only son of two teachers, and began constructing radio sets as a child. He graduated from Middle Tennessee State University in 1941, and served in the US Army Air Forces as a radio engineer during World War II. In 1945, he opened a store in Gallatin, Tennessee selling electrical appliances and some records. After noticing that many teenagers were seeking rhythm and blues records by musicians such as Joe Liggins and Cecil Gant, he started a mail order business for hard-to-find records, in collaboration with Nashville radio DJs Gene Nobles and Bill \\"Hoss\\" Allen. He began stocking R&B; records for sale to a white audience, and by 1950, the store had become Randy's Record Shop. He also started small local labels with Nobles, recording and issuing discs by Gant and others. Mike Callahan and David Edwards, Randy Wood: The Dot Records Story, May 6, 2003. Retrieved 29 June 2013 Wood was the grandfather of political activist and media personality John Wood Jr. Career He became co-owner of a local radio station, WHIN, and in January 1950 set up Dot Records, with Nobles, so as to release recordings by musicians who appeared on the station. Biography at Black Cat Rockabilly. Retrieved 29 June 2013 These included honky-tonk pianist Johnny Maddox, gospel singers the Fairfield 4, and R&B; group the Griffin Brothers, whose song \\"Weepin' & Cryin'\\" (Dot 1071) reached no.1 on the R&B; chart in early 1952. Other R&B; musicians on early Dot releases included Joe Liggins, Ivory Joe Hunter, and the Counts. Dot Records' first pop success came in 1952, with \\"Tryin'\\" by The Hilltoppers, followed by \\"P.S. I Love You\\". Wood also recorded country musicians such as Mac Wiseman and Jimmy C. Newman, who both had several national hits on the country music chart. By 1955, Wood realised that there was a market for R&B; songs re-recorded by white singers, which would allow them to be played on pop music stations catering for a white audience. At the time, many pop radio stations in the US would not play records by black musicians, despite the growing popularity of artists such as Fats Domino and Chuck Berry among white teenagers. He signed young singer Pat Boone to Dot, and had him record cover versions of R&B; songs, including \\"Ain't That a Shame\\" -- originally titled \\"Ain't It a Shame\\", and which Boone at one point wanted to retitle \\"Isn't That a Shame\\" -- and Little Richard's \\"Tutti Frutti\\". The songs were hits and, although Boone gave up recording such cover versions in 1956 in order to record more ballads -- mostly orchestrated by Billy Vaughn of the Hilltoppers, who had become Dot's musical director -- he remained associated with the watering-down of R&B; records for a wider audience. In 1956, Wood moved Dot Records to Hollywood, and found further commercial success with records by actor Tab Hunter, whom he signed because of Hunter's appeal to young women without regard to his musical inadequacies. Wood sold Dot Records to Paramount Pictures in 1957, while continuing as the label's president for a further decade. Increasingly he bought or leased recordings from small independent labels, before leaving the label in 1967. He then started another label, Ranwood, with Larry Welk, the son of musician Lawrence Welk. The company remains in business as part of the Welk Music Group. Randy's Record Shop in Tennessee also continued in business until 1991, and has since been declared a historical site.

Location and area  The Quirl rises about two kilometres south of K√∂nigstein in the so-called Land of Stones (Gebiet der Steine), part of Saxon Switzerland in which table hills (Tafelberge or Steine) are characteristic. In the immediate neighbourhood are the hills of Pfaffenstein and K√∂nigstein. On the northern side of the Quirl is a large bedding cave, the Diebskeller (\\"Thieves' Cellar\\").  History  Until around 1800 there were fields on the Quirl that belonged to the hereditary enfeoffed estate of Pfaffendorf. Later the Quirl was placed out of bounds to the public due to its proximity to K√∂nigstein Fortress and the fields were abandoned. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 the old footpath to the summit plateau was blown up so that Prussian troops there could not emplace their guns there.  Geology  The Quirl consists of sandstones of stage c, which are classified in the middle Turonian age of the Cretaceous in the geological time scale. In more recent publications these sandstones are also called Postelwitz Strata (Postelwitzer Schichten). The summit plateau corresponds to intermediate stratum Œ≥3. The bedding caves on the north side of the Quirl are in the lightly weathered intermediate stratum Œ≥2.  Ascents  The best base for a visit to the Quirl is the town of K√∂nigstein. There a hiking trail, marked with a red dot runs around the Quirl an on to the neighbouring Pfaffenstein. An unmarked, but signposted branch, the Kanonenweg enables the summit plateau to be reached easily. Other unmarked ascents are located near the Diebskeller on the north side.  Sources  * * Roland H.

The region is largely coterminous with the natural region of the same name, Saxon Switzerland, but extends well beyond the territory of the National Park within it. It includes the western part of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and is the oldest non-Alpine climbing region in Germany. Its history of climbing dates back to the first ascent in modern times of the Falkenstein by Bad Schandau gymnasts in 1864. Currently, there are over 1,100 summits with more than 17,000 climbing routes in the Saxon Switzerland area.S√§chsischer Bergsteiger Bund: Klettern im Elbsandsteingebirge  Climbing in Saxon Switzerland  Climbing in Saxon Switzerland is characterized by a strong traditional climbing ethic and a number of peculiarities rarely found in other climbing regions, or at least not to the same extent. An exception are Czech sandstone climbing regions, where similar rules apply. Climbers must observe the Saxon Climbing Regulations, which were first formulated in 1913 and are binding. The main principles of climbing in Saxon Switzerland are based on the idea of free climbing and a commitment to protecting the soft sandstone, which is prone to erosion and can be easily damaged, especially when wet. This results in specific rules and customs regarding safety equipment and climbing style.  Protection  Lead climber at Papststein The main means of protection are slings which are tied around natural features or threaded through natural holes in the rock. Knotted slings can be firmly placed within cracks, functioning similar to a camming device. Any form of metal protection such as nuts, cams or pitons are forbidden to use as they may damage the rock. Ring bolts can only be found in routes of the grades V and higher (with a few exceptions) but are only placed when no other protection is possible. There are usually large distances between rings and routes with only one or two of them are very common. Therefore, climbers often face large runouts and need to rely on slings for protection even in very hard routes. Only the person who makes the first ascent of a route is allowed to install ring bolts during the climb from the ground up. Bolting a route while hanging from a top rope is not permitted. In exceptional cases, later additions of ring bolts are decided by a commission of the Saxon Climbers Federation (SBB) when natural protection features have been destroyed or a route proves to be too dangerous. Bolts may also be placed as anchors in multipitch routes.  Climbing style  Climbers on the summit of Kleiner Wehlturm near Rathen The lead climber places all the protection from the ground up. Due to the limited protection, falls should be avoided, especially when relying on slings only. Upon reaching the summit, the leader anchors him- or herself using the abseil ring, a preinstalled anchor bolt or slings and belays the second and other members of the climbing party from the top. The second removes the protection during their climb. When all members of the climbing party have reached the top, the summit register is signed and all climbers usually rappel. Toproping is generally frowned upon and only allowed when not using abseil rings and it is ensured that the rope can not damage the rock. The Saxon Switzerland offers a large variety of single and multipitch routes of all difficulties and techniques such as chimneys, cracks, slabs and face climbing. The sometimes sparse and unusual possibilities of placing protection require practice and not only physical but also mental strength. Climbers should be confident to master a grade before starting a climb because resting on a weighted rope or retreating might not be safe or easy options.  Grading system  The Saxon Switzerland has its own grading system that was developed at the beginning of the 20th century. It uses roman numerals to denote the level of difficulty. Grades of VII and higher are subdivided by the letters a, b, and c. The Saxon Grading System is also used in other parts of East Germany and the Czech Republic. The hardest route in Saxon Switzerland is graded XIc. Additionally, there are grades for horizontal jumps, represented in Arabic numerals ranging from 1 to 7. Routes that are deemed especially worthwhile are marked with one or two asterisks.  Restrictions on free-standing climbing peaks  Climbing is only permitted on designated free-standing rock towers with at least 10 m prominence. An historic exception are three massifs which may be climbed. Almost all summits are furnished with summit registers and abseiling rings. These, like other safety rings, are looked after and maintained by the Saxon Climbers' Federation (SBB).  Saxon climbing regulations  Schuster relief on the Schuster Way on the Falkenstein Climbing regulations for Saxon Switzerland were first printed in 1913 in a climbing guide published by Rudolf Fehrmann, and have only been slightly amended since. The basic principles had been developed before 1900, mainly by Oscar Schuster. Their main feature is, that artificial aids to rock climbing are not permitted. They, therefore, constitute one of the foundations of the concept of free climbing, which is the most prevalent form of rock climbing today. The climbing regulations are also part of the mountain sport concept required under the National Parks Ordinance for the Free State of Saxony, which lays down how and to what extent climbing in the Saxon Switzerland National Park may be undertaken. The most important regulations are: * Artificial aids are forbidden. The climber is only allowed to use natural hand- and footholds and must use his own bodily strength to climb. * Ropes, slings, carabiners, etc., may only be used for protection. * The existing surface of the rock must not be altered (exceptions are safety rings). * Ring bolts may only be installed by the first person to climb a route. The bolting of subsequent rings is decided by the sub-committee of the SBB responsible. * The use of chalk or pof is forbidden. * Nuts, friends and similar aids are banned. Only slings may be used. * First ascents of a new climbing route may only be attempted from bottom to top. The opening of new routes by driving in pitons \\"from above\\" (i.e. by hanging off a rope from the summit or ledge) common in other climbing areas, is forbidden. * Climbing is forbidden on wet or damp rocks. In addition, the regulations go on to cover in detail the procedure for first ascents, climbing bans, the scale of climbing grades and conduct when climbing.

The Eidgah was built in 1640 CE during the Mughal era and has been in use for Eid celebration since then. The structure is a listed archaeological site of the Department of Archaeology and has historical, architectural and heritage values. It is an example of Mughal architecture. Conservationist architect Abu Sayeed M Ahmed wrote, \\"This Eidgah is the oldest surviving Mughal monument in Dhaka city. There is no second one with the architectural forms and features similar to it.\\" History The Mughal Eidgah is a monumental structure built during the Mughal Empire. the Eidgah was built by Mir Abul Qasim, a Diwan of Shah Shuja and builder of Boro Katra. The Mughal subehdars and diwans living in this land used to come to the Eidgah for Eid prayers. Mihrab (central prayer-niche) that Emams faced during prayers. Architectural value The Eidgah for Eid congregating was a platform measuring 148 feet by 137 feet in size raised from the surrounding land by 4‚Äì6 feet. It was oblong in plan, with thick brick walls enclosing the courtyard on all side except east. The 15-foot high west wall, the only surviving part of it, has a 5-foot deep four ‚Äìcentred and stilted arched semi-octagonal Mihrab with an inscription on top. It was decorated with multi-cusped arch and flanked by shallow subsidiary niches, three on each side. The surrounding wall was possibly partly perforated; these had a row of battlement cresting with additional elements decorating the corners, the projected parts of the walls and the diminishing sections on the western wall, like in a fort. Though these had structural reason to be there, but their placement and shapes contributed to the aesthetic too. During Mughal period, a river branch flowed beside the Eidgah connected the river near Saat Masjid. The Mughal Subehdars and Diwans living in this land used to come to the Eidgah for Eid prayers. People still gather at the place for Eid prayer congregation. The Eidgah spreads over around 3.5 bighas of land. Construction threats The oldest surviving Mughal-era Eidgah here faces a threat from unplanned construction of a six-storeyed mosque on its premises, a media report said. The Dhanmondi Eidgah mosque committee is constructing the building without approval from Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) as required by the Building Construction Act and Dhaka Metropolitan Building Rules. Architect Sayeed expressed the fear that the Eidgah structure may have been weakened by the rig vibration during construction of the new building. He also said, \\"It is a very bad choice of site for construction of a huge building, as it has spoilt the elegant look of the heritage monument.\\" Dhaka Metropolitan Building Rules of 2008 requires that any development within 250-metre radius of an archaeological and heritage site must have the permission of government's high-powered Nagar Unnayan Committee before approaching the Rajuk Building Committee for plan approval. \\"We are going to demolish the old mosque to complete the new one,\\" said Atiqul Habib, secretary general of Dhanmondi Eidgah Mosque Committee. The monument has also been overshadowed by a grocery shop that a mosque committee turned into an 'Islamic Research Centre' ‚Äì within ten feet of Eidgah's central Mihrab (central prayer- niche). Devotees of Eid-congregation and the aspiring visitors now have to take a detour around the new mosque to get to the Mughal Eidgah.

Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the Triple Gems of Jainism, Islam's Sharia, Catholicism's Canon Law, Buddhism's Eightfold Path, and Zoroastrianism's \\"good thoughts, good words, and good deeds\\" concept, among others. These frameworks are outlined and interpreted by various sources such as holy books, oral and written traditions, and religious leaders. Many of these share tenets with secular value frameworks such as consequentialism, freethought, and utilitarianism. Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not necessarily depend upon religion, though for some, this is \\"an almost automatic assumption.\\" According to The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics, religion and morality \\"are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides.\\" In the views of others, the two can overlap. According to one definition, morality is an active process which is, \\"at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason, that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing, while giving equal consideration to the interests of all those affected by what one does.\\" Value judgments can vary greatly between religions, past and present. People in various religious traditions, such as Christianity, may derive ideas of right and wrong from the rules and laws set forth in their respective authoritative guides and by their religious leaders. Equating morality to adherence to authoritative commands in a holy book is the Divine Command Theory. Polytheistic religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism generally draw from some of the broadest canons of religious works.Bodhippriya Subhadra Siriwardena, 'The Buddhist perspective of lay morality', 1996 There has been interest in the relationship between religion and crime and other behavior that does not adhere to contemporary laws and social norms in various countries. Studies conducted in recent years have explored these relationships, but the results have been mixed and sometimes contradictory.Edgar Saint George, \\"Religion's Effects On Crime Rates\\" The ability of religious faiths to provide value frameworks that are seen as useful is a debated matter. Religious commentators have asserted that a moral life cannot be led without an absolute lawgiver as a guide. Other observers assert that moral behavior does not rely on religious tenets, and secular commentators point to ethical challenges within various religions that conflict with contemporary social norms.  Relationship between religion and morality  Within the wide range of ethical traditions, religious traditions co-exist with secular value frameworks such as humanism, utilitarianism, and others. There are many types of religious values. Modern monotheistic religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity (and to a certain degree others such as Sikhism) define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. Polytheistic religious traditions tend to be less absolute. For example, within Buddhism, the intention of the individual and the circumstances play roles in determining whether an action is right or wrong.Peggy Morgan, \\"Buddhism.\\" In Barbara Stoler Miller points out a further disparity between the morals of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, \\"practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand.\\" According to Stephen Gaukroger: \\"It was generally assumed in the 17th century that religion provided the unique basis for morality, and that without religion, there could be no morality.\\" This view slowly shifted over time. In 1690, Pierre Bayle asserted that religion \\"is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality\\". Modern sources separate the two concepts. For example, The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics says that, > For many religious people, morality and religion are the same or > inseparable; for them either morality is part of religion or their religion > is their morality. For others, especially for nonreligious people, morality > and religion are distinct and separable; religion may be immoral or > nonmoral, and morality may or should be nonreligious. Even for some > religious people the two are different and separable; they may hold that > religion should be moral and morality should be, but they agree that they > may not be. Richard Paula and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking assert that, \\"Most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs, and the law.\\" They separate the concept of ethics from these topics, stating: > The proper role of ethical reasoning is to highlight acts of two kinds: > those which enhance the well-being of others‚Äîthat warrant our praise‚Äîand > those that harm or diminish the well-being of others‚Äîand thus warrant our > criticism. They note problems that could arise if religions defined ethics, such as: # religious practices like \\"torturing unbelievers or burning them alive\\" potentially being labeled \\"ethical\\" # the lack of a common religious baseline across humanity because religions provide different theological definitions for the idea of sin They further note that various documents, such as the UN Declaration of Human Rights lay out \\"transcultural\\" and \\"trans-religious\\" ethical concepts and principles‚Äîsuch as slavery, genocide, torture, sexism, racism, murder, assault, fraud, deceit, and intimidation‚Äîwhich require no reliance on religion (or social convention) for us to understand they are \\"ethically wrong\\". Armin Geertz suggests that \\"the age-old assumption that religion produces morals and values is neither the only, nor the most parsimonious, hypothesis for religion\\".  Religious frameworks  Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in Hinduism, which recognizes that it \\"may be inevitable and indeed necessary\\" in certain circumstances.Werner Menski, \\"Hinduism.\\" In In Christian traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as abortion or divorce. In the latter case, a 2008 study by the Barna Group found that some denominations have a significantly higher divorce rate than those in non-religious demographic groups (atheists and agnostics). However Catholics and Evangelical Christians had the lowest divorce rates and the agnostic/atheist group had by far the lowest number of married couples to begin with. According to Thomas Dixon, \\"Many today ... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world.\\" In the same vein, Christian theologian Ron Rhodes has remarked that \\"it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good.\\" Thomas Dixon states, \\"Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong.\\"  Religion and social dimensions  The study of religion and morality is contentious due to conceptual differences. The ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definition of religiosity all contribute to conflicting findings. Membership of a religious group can accentuate biases in behavior toward in group versus out group members, which may explain the lower number of interracial friends and greater approval of torture among church members. Furthermore, some studies have shown that religious prosociality is primarily motivated by wanting to appear prosocial, which may be related to the desire to further ones religious group. The egoistically motivated prosociality may also affect self-reports, resulting in biased results. Peer ratings can be biased by stereotypes, and indications of a persons group affiliation are sufficient to bias reporting. In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice. This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are racially segregated, and only 12% have a degree of diversity. According to global research done by Gallup on people from 145 countries, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week reported higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders). Even for people who were nonreligious, those who said they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors. Another global study by Gallup on people from 140 countries showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite them having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious. One study on pro-social sentiments showed that non-religious people were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people were less inclined when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers by Science DailyLaura R. Saslow, Robb Willer, Matthew Feinberg, Paul K. Piff, Katharine Clark, Dacher Keltner and Sarina R. Saturn My Brother's Keeper? Compassion Predicts Generosity More Among Less Religious Individuals A study found that religious people were more charitable than their irreligious counterparts. The study revealed that forty percent of worship service attending Americans volunteered regularly to help the poor and elderly as opposed to 15% of Americans who never attend services. Moreover, religious individuals were more likely than non-religious individuals to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%). Other research has shown similar correlations between religiosity and giving. Some scientific studies show that the degree of religiosity is generally associated with higher ethical attitudes ‚Äî for example, surveys suggesting a positive connection between faith and altruism.e.g. a survey by Robert Putnam showing that membership of religious groups was positively correlated with membership of voluntary organizations The overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear. A 2001 review of studies on this topic found \\"The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime.\\" Original in italics. Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul argues for a positive correlation between the degree of public religiosity in a society and certain measures of dysfunction, however, an analysis published later in the same journal contends that a number of methodological and theoretical problems undermine any findings or conclusions taken from Paul's research. In another response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study.Gary F. Jensen (2006) Department of Sociology, Vanderbilt University Religious Cosmologies and Homicide Rates among Nations: A Closer Look http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/pdf/2006-7.pdf Journal of Religion and Society, Volume 8, ISSN 1522-5658 http://purl.org/JRS His conclusion is that a \\"complex relationship\\" exists between religiosity and homicide \\"with some dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it\\". Some works indicate that some societies with lower religiosity have lower crime rates‚Äîespecially violent crime, compared to some societies with higher religiosity. Phil Zuckerman notes that Denmark and Sweden, \\"which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world,\\" enjoy \\"among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world.\\" Zuckerman's work is based on his studies conducted during a 14-month period in Scandinavia in 2005‚Äì2006 of 150 people. However, Zuckerman noted that none of these correlations mean that atheism and non-religiosity cause social well-being, instead existential security is what allows for atheism and non-religion to thrive in these societies. Modern research in criminology also acknowledges an inverse relationship between religion and crime,As is stated in: with some studies establishing this connection. For example:  Chard-Wierschem, D. (1998). In pursuit of the \\"true\\" relationship: A longitudinal study of the effects of religiosity on delinquency and substance abuse. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Dissertation.   * A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, \\"religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior\\". However, in his books about the materialism in Americas Evangelical Churches Ron Sider accuses fellow Christians of failing to do better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).See, for instance, Ronald J. Sider, The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience: Why Are Christians Living Just Like the Rest of the World? (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2005). Sider quotes extensively from polling research by The Barna Group showing that moral behavior of evangelical Christians is unexemplary. A Georgia State University study published in the academic journal Theoretical Criminology suggests that religion helps criminals to justify their crimes and might \\"encourage\\" it. The research concluded that \\"many street offenders anticipate an early death, making them less prone to delay gratification, more likely to discount the future costs of crime, and thus more likely to offend\\".  Criticism of religious values  Religious values can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on murder, mass atrocities, and slavery. For example, Simon Blackburn states that \\"apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels\\". In regard to Christianity, he states that the \\"Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women\\". He provides examples such as the phrase in Exodus 22:18 that has \\"helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America\\": \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,\\" and notes that the Old Testament God apparently has \\"no problems with a slave-owning society\\", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and \\"is keen on child abuse\\". Blackburn notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's New Testament as well. Philosopher David Hume stated that, \\"The greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere.\\"David Hume, \\"The Natural History of Religion.\\" In Bertrand Russell said, \\"There are also, in most religions, specific ethical tenets which do definite harm. The Catholic condemnation of birth control, if it could prevail, would make the mitigation of poverty and the abolition of war impossible. The Hindu beliefs that the cow is a sacred animal and that it is wicked for widows to remarry cause quite needless suffering.\\" He asserts that > You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of > any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater > has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs....You find > as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane > feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the > diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, > or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in > the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the > world. According to Paul Copan, Jewish laws in the bible show an evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing forced slavery and identifying slaves as persons and not property. According to Bertrand Russell, \\"Clergymen almost necessarily fail in two ways as teachers of morals. They condemn acts which do no harm and they condone acts which do great harm.\\" He cites an example of a clergyman who was warned by a physician that his wife would die if she had another (her tenth) child, but impregnated her regardless, which resulted in her death. \\"No one condemned him; he retained his benefice and married again. So long as clergymen continue to condone cruelty and condemn 'innocent' pleasure, they can only do harm as guardians of the morals of the young.\\" Russell further states that, \\"The sense of sin which dominates many children and young people and often lasts on into later life is a misery and a source of distortion that serves no useful purpose of any sort or kind.\\" Russel allows that religious sentiments have, historically, sometimes led to morally acceptable behavior, but asserts that, \\"in the present day, [1954] such good as might be done by imputing a theological origin to morals is inextricably bound up with such grave evils that the good becomes insignificant in comparison.\\"  Secular morality  The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso in 2007 There are number of secular value frameworks, such as consequentialism, freethought, humanism, and utilitarianism. Yet, there have been opposing views about the ability of both religious and secular moral frameworks to provide useful guides to right and wrong actions. Various non-religious commentators have supported the ability of secular value frameworks to provide useful guides. Bernard Williams argued that, \\"Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate morality at all ... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing.\\" Other observers criticize religious morals as incompatible with modern social norms. For example, popular atheist Richard Dawkins, writing in The God Delusion, has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that we now consider morally repugnant. He has stated that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the Holocaust on account of antisemitic Christian doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed unfair restrictions on the legal and civil rights of women, and that Christians have condoned slavery of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history. According to Paul Copan, the position of the Bible to slaves is a positive one for the slaves in that Jewish laws imposed a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treated slaves as persons, not property.  See also  *Criticism of Christianity#Ethics *Criticism of Islam#Morality *Ethics in religion *Morality without religion Notes :a. Zuckerman identifies that Scandinavians have \\"relatively high rates of petty crime and burglary\\", but \\"their overall rates of violent crime‚Äîsuch as murder, aggravated assault, and rape‚Äîare among the lowest on earth\\" (Zuckerman 2008, pp. 5‚Äì6). :b. The authors also state that \\"A few hundred years ago rates of homicide were astronomical in Christian Europe and the American colonies,\\" and \\"[t]he least theistic secular developing democracies such as Japan, France, and Scandinavia have been most successful in these regards.\\" They argue for a positive correlation between the degree of public religiosity in a society and certain measures of dysfunction, an analysis published later in the same journal argues that a number of methodological problems undermine any findings or conclusions in the research.

FAIRE-Seq is a successor of DNase-seq for the genome-wide identification of accessible DNA regions in the genome. Both the protocols for identifying open chromatin regions have biases depending on underlying nucleosome structure. For example, FAIRE-seq provides higher tag counts at non-promoter regions. On the other hand, DNase-seq signal is higher at promoter regions, and DNase-seq has been shown to have better sensitivity than FAIRE-seq even at non-promoter regions.  DNase-seq Footprinting  DNase-seq requires some downstream bioinformatics analyses in order to provide genome-wide DNA footprints. The computational tools proposed can be categorized in two classes: segmentation-based and site- centric approaches. Segmentation-based methods are based on the application of Hidden Markov models or sliding window methods to segment the genome into open/closed chromatin region. Examples of such methods are: HINT, Boyle method and Neph method. Site-centric methods, on the other hand, find footprints given the open chromatin profile around motif-predicted binding sites, i.e., regulatory regions predicted using DNA-protein sequence information (encoded in structures such as Position weight matrix). Examples of these methods are CENTIPEDE and Cuellar-Partida method.

He then made his List A debut for the Unicorns in the 2011 Clydesdale Bank 40 against Lancashire, and made eight further List A appearances for the Unicorns in the 2011 season, taking a total of 5 wickets at an average of 34.40, with best figures of 4/35. He also scored a total of 115 runs in these matches, which came at a batting average of 23.00, with a high score of 26. In 2012 he played 11 games for the Unicorns, scoring 233 runs at 25.88 but taking only one wicket. When Leeds/Bradford MCCU played their first first-class matches in 2012 he scored 134 runs at 33.50 and took 5 wickets at 24.00. He captained the team in 2013, scoring 155 runs at 51.66 and taking 7 wickets at 24.14. In the match against Leicestershire, which Leeds/Bradford MCCU won by 102 runs, he scored 114 not out.Leicestershire v Leeds/Bradford MCCU 2013 He made his County Championship debut for Lancashire against Essex in June 2013, playing as an opening batsman.Essex v Lancashire 2013 In ten matches he made 722 runs at 55.53 with eight fifties. Derbyshire signed Reece from Lancashire on a two-year contract in October 2016. In June 2017, he was hospitalised after suffering breathing difficulties during a Championship match against Northamptonshire. After scoring 1180 runs in all formats during his first season with Derbyshire, Reece signed a new three-year contract with the county. Reece was selected to play for Chittagong Vikings in the 2017-18 Bangladesh Premier League. At the conclusion of the 2018 season which was much taken up by a foot injury that kept Reece out for over 3 months, he signed a further one-year deal to keep him at Derbyshire until at least 2021. His credentials were enhanced by the surprising bowling of 7-20 in an end-of-season championship match against Gloucestershire, giving rise to hopes that he can be considered a genuine all- rounder. In October 2019, Reece signed a new contract with Derbyshire until the end of the 2023 season.

Although this church was formally established in 1921, the origin of the parish dates to 1839. Description During the 19th Century, the Redemptorist missionary order had a major base at this location starting in 1839, catering to the significant German population in the area. St. Philomena's was initially known as 'The Factory Church' due to being housed in an industrial warehouse, but John Neumann arrived to become head pastor and, in a matter of a few years, had a church building erected at the corner of Liberty Avenue and 14th Street. As Neumann's associate pastor, Francis Xavier Seelos also helped in serving the parish, eventually becoming pastor himself until being transferred in 1854. Thus, St. Philomena's is notable for having housed two people recognized in the Catholic beatification process (Neumann having been declared a saint in 1977). As the expansion of industrialization and commercialism occurred in the early 20th century, the church's location was no longer viable, and the building was sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1922 and eventually torn down. The Parish was then relocated to Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood eventually housed in a building designed by architect John T. Comes. The funeral services of famed boxers Harry Greb and Billy Conn occurred at the parish. As time progressed, the gradual loss of population caused the church to be closed and the parish to be contracted.

History  Hangnail was formed when Nick Radovanovic and Jacob Dosemagen, who had started a group called Say What when they were only eight years old, met up with Mike Middleton in high school. Matt Wendt joined the band later as a second guitarist, making the group a foursome. Right after graduation in 1997, Hangnail appeared on Cornerstone Festival's new band showcase stage, which enabled the band to engage in a serious career. Subsequent touring allowed the band to build up a strong fan base, and in 1999 Hangnail recorded its self- titled debut album, released on BEC Recordings. This release was followed up by extensive touring in 2000, and the band's second release, Facing Changes, was released in 2001 on Tooth & Nail Records. This release was bundled with an Acoustic EP, which showcased the band's varied style. The band played at Cornerstone Festival in 2001, and began work on a third studio album. In 2003, the band finished recording the album, entitled Transparent, and announced that it would disband after playing a final show at Cornerstone. The album was released immediately following this performance after the group disbanded. Style Hangnail's punk-pop style combined rhythms from heavy metal and melodic punk rock with pop music flourishes. According to Allmusic, this style was mixed with \\"praise-oriented lyrics to come up with a unique sound that rocks wildly with metal riffs and power chords.\\" The band's musical influences varied. According to Mike Middleton, when Hangnail first started the members liked bands such as Nirvana, Green Day, and Weezer. Other early influences include Stevie Wonder, MxPx, Pennywise, and NOFX, though according to Middleton the band broadened its listening tastes to a wide variety of genres ranging from classical to rock and roll.

It occurs in the Upper Midwest region of the United States. Description This is a perennial herb growing up to a meter tall. The leaves are compound, each made up of three leaflets. The herbage is coated in whitish hairs, giving the plant a silvery look. The inflorescence is a terminal spike of cream to yellowish or pale pink flowers. Each flower is only half a centimeter long. There are both cleistogamous flowers which never open, and chasmogamous flowers which open and allow insects inside; both types produce seed. Blooming occurs in July through September, with peak bloom in mid-July. The plant does not produce flowers until its maturity at the age of 6 to 9 years. The fruit is a legume pod. One plant can produce over 500 pods, however, many of them contain no viable seeds.USFWS. http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/881006.pdf Prairie Bush Clover Recovery Plan. October 1988.

The Nature Conservancy. Most occurrences are in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota,Lespedeza leptostachya. Center for Plant Conservation. and it is rare across its known range. It is federally listed as a threatened species of the US. This plant grows only in the tallgrass prairie, mainly in dry areas. The soils may be gravelly, sandy, and/or calcareous, and are generally well- drained. Other plants in the area include big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), yellow Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis), porcupine grass (Stipa spartea), Penn sedge (Carex pennsylvanica), copper-shouldered sedge (Carex bicknellii), sand-bracted sedge (Carex muhlenbergii), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), prairie phlox (Phlox pilosa), lead plant (Amorpha canescens), rough blazing star (Liatris aspera), purple prairie clover (Dalea purpurea), showy goldenrod (Solidago speciosa), grass-leaved goldenrod (S. graminifolia), prairie gentian (Gentiana puberulenta), hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens), blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium albidum), cream wild indigo (Baptisia leucophaea), flax-leaved aster (Ionactis linariifolius), silky aster (Symphyotrichum sericeum), pale prairie coneflower (Echinacea pallida), milkwort (Polygona polygama), prairie violet (Viola pedatifida), and bird's foot violet (Viola pedata). It can be found alongside its relative, Lespedeza capitata, and it has been known to hybridize with it, though this is rare. Conservation There are 32 to 36 occurrences of the plant remaining in widely scattered locations, and most populations are small, containing fewer than 150 individuals. There are many more historical occurrences which no longer exist. The plant is threatened by the loss and degradation of its prairie habitat. Much of it has been consumed for development and converted to agriculture. The prevention of agents of natural disturbance, such as wildfire and the grazing of wild ungulates, has allowed ecological succession to occur, turning native prairie to shrubland. The plant does not compete well with woody shrubs. The plant can tolerate an amount of disturbance, and probably requires it; it was likely adapted to a landscape regularly trampled and grazed by bison. Other threats include quarry mining, herbicides and surface runoff, mowing, and weeds. Heavy herbivory by insects and small mammals has been observed on the plants, including invasion of the pods by beetles. The plant does not reproduce until at least its sixth year, and when it does reproduce, it usually self-fertilizes, contributing to a low genetic diversity in populations. The plant has been reintroduced at one site in Iowa. As the plant probably benefited from the presence of bison, researchers are putting cattle on one site to test the effects of their grazing.L. leptostachya. Chicago Botanic Garden.

The structure of this product is 3-Œü-Œ≤-lycotetraosyl (22S,23S,25S)-23-acetoxy-3Œ≤,27-dihydroxy-5Œ±-spirosolane 27-Œü-Œ≤-D- glucopyranoside. Fujiwara and colleagues were the first to isolate esculeoside A from the ripe fruit of the Cherry tomato in 2002. Esculeoside A, along with many other steroidal alkaloid glycosides, have been shown to possess cytotoxic activity that could result in a variety of potential health benefits for humans. Solanum lycopersicum  Synthesis  This natural product can be obtained using column chromatographies of high-porous polystyrene gels and reversed silica gels from a methanolic extract of many varieties of tomatoes. It will appear as colorless needles when synthesized using this method. Evidence suggests that Œ±-tomatine is a precursor of esculeoside A. In order for alpha tomatine to be converted to esculeoside A, isomerization of the F-ring is required. The mechanism for this reaction is unclear at this time but research from Iijima and colleagues in 2009 suggest a glycosylation step in the putative pathway from Œ±-tomatine to esculeoside A depends on the plant hormone ethylene.  Occurrence  Potatoes, eggplant, and tomatoes are all solanaceous plants that contain unique glycoalkaloids. In the case of tomatoes, one of those unique glycoalkaloids is esculeoside A. A tomato saponin, esculeoside A, is found in quantities four times that of lycopene in ripe tomatoes.  Potential health benefits  Studies have shown esculeoside A may be metabolized into derivatives that perform various beneficial activities in the human body including anti-osteoporosis, anti-menopausal disorder and anti-tumor activities. Recent studies in mice have shown a potential link between esculeoside A and cholesterol levels. In one study, esculeoside A administered to mice reduced serum levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides by 25-45% without impacting the rates of HDL cholesterol. The potential health benefits of esculeoside A appear to change with factors such as the age of the tomato fruit, the heat used in processing tomatoes, and the pH used in processing. The highest amounts of esculeoside A were found in the outer skin and wall (pericarp wall) of the tomato fruit. Mature tomatoes tended to show higher amounts of esculeoside A than extracts taken from immature tomatoes. Extracts of esculeoside A in the Katsumata study were shown to be stable when heated until the point of 225 ¬∞C. This same study found esculeoside A extracts in water at pH 7-11 were stable throughout the heat sterilization process but unstable under acidic conditions. Research has also shown esculeoside A amounts increase when tomatoes are treated with the phytohormone, ethylene. Collectively, research suggests daily intake of esculeoside A from tomatoes could have many benefits.

Excavation The tell was discovered in 1960 by Dutch geomorphologist, Willem van Liere. It was excavated between 1960 and 1965 by Henri de Contenson and van Liere and later between 1976 and 1978 by Peter Akkermans, Maurits van Loon, J. J. Roodenberg and H. T. Waterbolk. Construction The mound was found to be approximately deep and showed evidence of 11 periods of occupation spread over at least 1000 years between ca. 7400 and 6200 BC. The earliest levels, 11 to 8, showed early Neolithic aceramic occupation developing on to stages with pottery in levels 7 to 1, from which over 7000 sherds were recovered. Material from later levels was visible on the surface when first discovered. The layout and arrangement of houses seems to have been well ordered with similar arrangements of rooms, entrances, hearths and other features. Houses were made of mud bricks and generally rectangular with three or four rooms. Culture Bouqras seems to have developed in comparative isolation with few other settlements near the area. Interiors of the buildings featured white plastered walls with occasional use of red ochre for decoration with some images of birds. By later stages of the settlement, it was likely inhabited by as many as 700 to 1000 villagers. Large quantities of obsidian was found suggesting links with Anatolia. A distinctive group of limestone, alabaster and gypsum vessels was also found made from local materials. Rounded or cylindrical beads were also found made of bone, shell, greenstones, carnelian and dentalium. An alabaster bracelet fragment and pendant were recovered as forms of personal decoration. Several stone stamp seals including one of alabaster and one of jadeite were found with incised rectilinear patterns along with a few clay figurines. Pottery started to be found from the third level of habitation including a white plaster vessel. Other materials were varied with coarse and fine sherds made with mixed straw and sand. Some sherds were burnished or painted red, one with a triangle on it. Arrowheads recovered included Byblos points and two types of Amuq points along with two other distinctive designs. Flints were usually of a fine dark grey or brown type found locally. File:Bowl MET DP368652.jpgStone Bowl, Syria, probably Bouqras, ca. late 8th millennium BC.

This has shown rain fed agriculture was practiced at Bouqras including cultivation of Emmer, Einkorn and free-threshing wheat, naked and hulled barley, peas and lentils.Van Zeist W. , Waterbolk-Van-Rooijen W., Paleorient, Volume 11/2, The Palaeobotany of Tell Bouqras, Eastern Syria, 1985. Sickle blades, querns and pounders appear in the early stages at Bouqras, but not in later stages. White Ware was found suggested to have been used as basket covering to make them impermeable. Sheep and goat comprised approximately 80% of the 5800 identifiable fragments of animal remains found. Other fauna included pigs and cattle, the domestication of which is uncertain.

For Ahmet G√ºne≈ütekin, a self-taught artist, art is a passion which has driven him since his childhood. He left the town of Batman for Istanbul in 1991, but had to wait several years before he found his own style at the beginning of the 2000s. He then abandoned the figurative to launch himself into a ‚Äúnarrative abstraction‚Äù. This kind of production is loaded with the recollection of a vernacular art, the memory of motifs such as carpets, lamps, Ottoman copperware in which geometry is the leading force. G√ºne≈ütekin uses a unique technique with an individual method and precision. After establishing a complex web of black acrylic paint, he fills each of the small spaces with a layer of oil paint, ranging from the light to the dark. Then, using a sort of pen with a rubber tip, he engraves into the paint, and writes as a calligrapher would on a book. He writes on his paintings by removing material, a principle which has more in common with sculpture than painting. After the agreement he signed with the London-based Marlborough Gallery ‚Äì one of the world‚Äôs top five reputable galleries ‚Äì in 2013, Ahmet G√ºne≈ütekin made room for himself in the international art market. Marlborough‚Äôs first move was to open an exhibition in the same timeframe as the 55th Venice Biennial. When Massimiliano Gioni, listed G√ºne≈ütekin‚Äôs ‚ÄüMomentum of Memory‚Äù exhibition among the ‚ÄüTop 10 exhibitions to see,‚Äù the media couldn‚Äôt remain indifferent. G√ºne≈ütekin‚Äôs works appeared in high circulation Italian dailies such as Il Manifesto,http://ilmanifesto.info/il- passato-oscuro/ La Repubblica, La Stampa. Naturally, his works drew the attention of the art circle. In November 2013, Marlborough Gallery opened its doors in New York to G√ºne≈ütekin. After making a flamboyant introduction for G√ºne≈ütekin with a solo exhibition, ‚ÄúAhmet G√ºne≈ütekin: Recent Paintings‚Äù between 26 November and 4 January 2014, Marlborough Gallery prepared an intensive program for 2014. The exhibitions that began in January with Arco Madrid was followed by the New York Armory Show, Art Breda, and Art Basel Hong Kong. Afterward Marlborough Monaco Gallery opened a solo exhibition by Ahmet G√ºne≈ütekin from 18 September to 14 November. His works are on display at the Marlborough Galleries in Barcelona, Madrid, Monaco and New York at their permanent exhibition halls all the year round. G√ºne≈ütekin‚Äôs works can be briefly described as the interpretation of the oral narratives, legends and mythology from Anatolian, Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations using free technique. He creates optical and vibrant works, with the solar disc as one of his occurring motifs. The figurative way of expression is present in all his oeuvres, even though in an abstract stylized way. In all his contemporaneous works, the characters, symbols and scenes are taken out of ancient times, and these characters are symbolic, woven into symbolic tales about the essential questions of mankind.  Style and Technique  Ahmet G√ºne≈ütekin realizes his works by adopting diverse methods. Gradient optics, dimensional canvases, flat canvases, sun explosions and installations expose his main approach that is to stay out of conventional practices applied on canvas. His art works are composed of charming colours, intricately combined layers, and the tales of the ancient times. The Kurdish artist thinks that mythology is the source of all beginnings. Yedizim, as of a dualist religion, has first emerged in the ancient Mesopotamia, rests on the belief that people make distinctions between the good and the evil. The narratives of the culture and its peculiar imitations spontaneously offer precise choices. However, G√ºne≈ütekin aims not only to convey messages, also he tries to reveal his own mythology and truths, by expressing himself painting and narrating the diversity of the culture. The characters of the myths he draw are also the ancient characters of the Greek mythology. For G√ºne≈ütekin, there actually appears no difference between Shahmeran, one of the ancient mythological creatures of Mesopotamia and Medusa in Greek mythology. The effect of embroidery can be best observed in artist‚Äôs recent paintings. The drawings and the circles are combined in one geometric structure, and the uses of the colours radically effect the eye. They also provide a narrative, for the symbols and emotions put forward all these elements in the paintings. The refined and meticulously cultivated colour palettes and drawings which they have comprised in harmony are the base of G√ºne≈ütekin‚Äôs works. Mesopotamia, where the artist was born, and Anatolia, the mythological creatures such as Phoenix or the Peacock Angel, form G√ºne≈ütekin‚Äôs most important source of inspiration. The glowing sun marks his peculiar signature. His method of oil painting is a model that reveals itself in adopting embroiderer‚Äôs patient work that is to knit and adorn, and to make a drawing model out of it. The diverse uses of the light, the thickness of the lines and the colours, and their density pave the way to gross geometric forms. His oil paintings are the outcome of a hard and dense work process, and give the impression that they are magnified by sculpturing. His colossal works and his paintings resemble the historical art works that are consist of archaeological fragments and figures. However, the most enchanting form he adopts is the glitter of his genuine light globes.

Following the Traces of the Sun with the Masters  Ahmet G√ºne≈ütekin traced and compiled ancient myths, oral narratives and legends of Anatolia and Mesopotamia as of 1997. He took excursions to the villages and towns of Anatolia and Mesopotamia and conducted in-depth researches since 2003. He set up art exhibitions in the historical sights and public spaces together with many artists from contemporary art, sculpture and photography. The series of the exhibition titled Following the Traces of the Sun with the Masters brought about his first major exhibition, The Colors after Darkness.  Documentary Films  G√ºne≈ütekin became the art director of the news show Haberci, produced and directed by Co≈ükun Aral in 2005. Afterwards he produces his own documentary series titled Following the Traces of the Sun for TRT 1 and the series came to be the first documentary films to focus on art in Turkey.  Children's Art Classes  In his excursions to Anatolia and Mesopotamia, Ahmet G√ºne≈ütekin provided painting classes to the children so that they can learn how to express themselves in visual arts. In classes, G√ºne≈ütekin taught children about art concepts and techniques by exposing them to many different kinds of art materials. G√ºne≈ütekin met over 5,000 children and introduced them the world of painting.

Early life and career Jean Richardot belonged to the network of families from the Franche-Comt√© that rose to important posts in the administration of the Habsburg Netherlands under the patronage of Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle. He was born in Champlitte in 1540 as the son of Guillaume Grusset and Marguerite Richardot. His uncle on his mother's side was Fran√ßois Richardot, the confessor of Margaret of Parma, a close collaborator of Granvelle and his successor as bishop of Arras. Fran√ßois Richardot supervised his nephew's education and furthered his first steps in the Habsburg administration. Whether out of gratitude or calculation, Jean Grusset subsequently adopted his uncle's surname. After his humanities at the Coll√®ge Granvelle in Besan√ßon, Jean studied law at the universities of Leuven, where he established strong ties with one of his professors, Peter Peckius. He continued his studies in Rome and Padua and obtained his doctorate in law from the University of Bologna. Thanks to the patronage of Granvelle, Philip II appointed Richardot councillor in the Great Council of Mechelen in 1568. Seven years later he was promoted to the Privy Council, one of the three Collateral Councils that advised the Governor-General of the Habsburg Netherlands, a post that was at the time held by Don Luis de Requesens y Z√∫√±iga. In the confusion that followed the death of Requesens, Richardot sided with the Dutch Revolt and its leader William the Silent. The move earned him an appointment to the Privy Council of the rebels' Governor-General Archduke Matthias. In that capacity he was sent to Arras to use his local connections to dissuade the States of Artois from joining the Union of Arras. Rise to power under Farnese Richardot would soon follow the example of the States of Artois, Hainaut and Lille, Douai and Orchies and reconcile with the new Governor- General, Alexander Farnese. He even penned a satirical attack on William the Silent, published anonymously as Le Renart decouvert (Mons: Rutger Velpius, 1580). Farnese was quick to recognize Richardot's talents, confirmed his membership of the Privy Council in 1580 and saw to his appointment as president of the Council of Artois in 1581. One of his first achievements was persuading the States of Artois to accept the return of Spanish units from the Army of Flanders. Soon thereafter Richardot was knighted by Philip II. On 26 February 1583, he was appointed councillor of the Council of State, the highest of the Collateral Councils and as such in charge of advising on matters of state. Farnese employed Richardot in many of the negotiations that secured the reconciliation of towns in Flanders and Brabant. Among these were Ypres, Bruges, Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp. He was also put in charge of the delegation that met with the envoys of Queen Elizabeth I at Bourbourg in 1587, in a feigned attempt to end hostilities between England and Spain. Meanwhile, Farnese sent Richardot twice to the court of Madrid. His mission in 1583-1584 was to obtain more men and money for the war in the Netherlands. In 1589 he was sent to explain Farnese's failure to invade England with the Spanish Armada. The disgrace and death of Farnese in December 1592 put Richardot's career on hold. The acting Governor-General Count Peter Ernst von Mansfeld even sought means to remove him from the Council of State. Initially, the Count of Fuentes was no less hostile, though he came to value Richardot's abilities towards the end of his tenure as acting Governor-General. President of the Privy Council under the Archdukes Richardot saw his political fortunes restored after Cardinal-Archduke Albert was installed as the new Governor-General in February 1596. On 15 May 1597 Albert's recommendation ensured his appointment to the post of Chief-President of the Privy Council. From then on Richardot would be the highest ranking and most influential subject of the Habsburg Netherlands serving the Governor-General and subsequently the sovereign Archdukes Albert and Isabella. As a well known supporter of a general pacification in the Netherlands, he was often depicted by those in favor of continuing the war against the United Provinces and their English and French allies as lacking in loyalty to the Spanish crown. In spite of that opposition, Richardot's policies would gradually prevail. The Somerset House Conference of 1604, ascribed to Juan Pantoja de la Cruz. Jean Richardot is seated second on the left. At every stage Richardot was at the center of the negotiations, as a rule seconded by the archducal Audiencier Louis Verreycken. Between February and May 1598, the two of them teamed up with Juan de Tassis in the talks leading to the Peace of Vervins between Philip II and Henry IV of France. Two years later, Richardot had to admit defeat when talks held at Boulogne broke up over issues of precedence, thereby wasting the chance to bring an end to the war between Elizabeth I and Philip III. When the succession of James I of England opened a new window of opportunity, Richardot, Verreycken and Charles princely count of Arenberg participated between May and August 1604 in the conference at Somerset House that elaborated the Treaty of London. In an effort to conclude a peace treaty with the Dutch Republic, Ambrogio Spinola and Richardot acted as the chief negotiators in the Habsburg delegation at the conference of The Hague from February to August 1608. Hopes to reach a definitive peace foundered however on irreconcilable issues of religion and trade. Under the mediation of France and England, the parties then settled for the Twelve Years' Truce that was signed in Antwerp in April 1609. Death and descendants Almost immediately after concluding the Truce, the archducal regime was confronted with the succession dispute over the Duchies of J√ºlich, Cleves and Berg. Soon Henry IV of France and Archduke Albert were sharply divided over how to deal with the crisis. To make matters worse, the Prince of Cond√© chose that moment to flee to Brussels with his wife, Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, thereby hoping to put her out of reach of the French king's amorous attentions. Hoping to avert a war, Richardot travelled to the French Court in August 1609 with instructions to assure Henry IV of Albert's neutrality in both affairs. In a show of displeasure, Henry conducted the audience outdoors, compelling the almost septuagenarian minister to stand bareheaded in the Sun for over an hour. Apparently suffering from the effects of hyperthermia, Richardot died on the way home at the residence of his son and namesake, the Bishop of Arras, on 3 September. He was buried in the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament of Miracles of the then collegiate church of St Gudula in Brussels. In 1568 Jean Richardot married Anne Courcol de Baillencourt, who descended of a noble family from Artois. The couple had twelve children. Among them were: *Fran√ßoise, married Conrad III Schetz dict van Ursel, created 1st baron of Hoboken in 1600, first archducal ambassador in England (1604-1609), ancestor of the Dukes d'Ursel. *Jean Richardot the Younger, bishop of Arras (1603-1609) and prince-archbishop of Cambrai (1609-1614). *Fran√ßois, lieutenant of a company of cavalry, died in the Battle of Nieuwpoort. *Pierre, abbot of Echternach (1607-1628). *Guillaume Richardot, who was educated in the house of Justus Lipsius, styled baron of Lembeek, created count of Galmaarden (in French: Gammeranges) in 1623. *Antoine Richardot, who was also educated in the house of Justus Lipsius, captain of a company of cavalry, died of his wounds after an encounter at Rheinberg.

During the first decade of the 20th century, he espoused anarcho-syndicalist ideas. However, later in his life, Cicvariƒá was the editor of several openly antisemitic tabloid journals, and a Nazi collaborator. He was executed on 31 October 1944 by the Yugoslav Partisans after the Belgrade Offensive. Biography=Early life and education Cicvariƒá was born on September 14, 1879 in the village of Nikojeviƒái, near U≈æice, then part of the Principality of Serbia. He attended the Gymnasium in U≈æice. He refused to attend religious classes and claimed to be an atheist and an unbeliever. Because of confrontations with his professor Nastas Petroviƒá, a member of the People's Radical Party, who claimed Cicvariƒá's political views to be \\"demonic\\", he dropped out of the U≈æice Gymnasium in 1896. He soon left the city altogether and moved to Belgrade where he completed the Gymnasium and enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy. Subsequently, he enrolled in the University of Vienna, but decided to leave his studies and return to Serbia where he became a journalist and anarchist activist. Anarchist political activism Cicvariƒá was arrested and imprisoned several times for his writings. In 1905 Vasilije Kne≈æeviƒá, a member of Cicvariƒá's group the Equality Workers' Club (Radniƒçki klub Jednakost) founded the anarchist newspaper Bread and Freedom (Hleb i sloboda). Soon after, Kne≈æeviƒá started to pay heavy fines for the paper and was imprisoned due to his inability to cover his debts. In this period Cicvariƒá took over the paper. The paper had only three issues, and Kne≈æeviƒá moved to Valjevo after serving his sentence, disillusioned with the anarchists Cicvariƒá and Petar Munjiƒá. Cicvariƒá and Munjiƒá later founded the anarchist paper Worker's Struggle (Radniƒçka borba) in 1907. The paper was closed down after the events related to the strike led by sugar workers in ƒåukarica in February 1907. Cicvariƒá was imprisoned in Po≈æarevac because of his writing and was later released during the Annexation Crisis in 1908. In 1911 Cicvariƒá met Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá who was working on the printing press owned by ≈Ωivojin Daƒçiƒá, where Civariƒá's paper the New Age (Novo vreme) was being printed. Cicvariƒá gave ƒåabrinoviƒá many books including all of his own works. ƒåabrinoviƒá later smuggled the books to Sarajevo where some were burned by his mother, while some were kept safe and were given to his friends as gifts. From 1911 to 1915, Cicvariƒá published the daily The Guard (Stra≈æa), the \\"free-minded organ of public thought\\". Cicvariƒá was drafted during the Balkan wars. He is mentioned by Leon Trotsky in his war correspondence The Balkan Wars: 1912‚Äì13 as a \\"free anarchist\\" and publisher of The Guard, and as an outspoken critic of the Serbian Social Democratic Party. He writes \\"Since, in this little country, everyone knows everyone else and does not hesitate to poke his nose into the private lives of his political adversaries, the polemic against the leaders of Social Democracy is carried on in a form that would not bear translation into any European language\\". He was drafted again in World War I, and surrendered, becoming a prisoner of war of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Neusiedl am See. Tabloid journalism and Nazi collaboration After World War I, he started writing for Belgrade Daily (Beogradski dnevnik), owned by Du≈°an Paranos and whose editor-in-chief was Mehmed ≈Ωuniƒá. At first, he wrote introductory articles and was the chief polemicist. On 7 August 1922 he was signed as editor and director of the paper. From September 1922 on, the paper bore the title Krsta Cicvariƒá's Belgrade Daily (Beogradski dnevnik Krste Cicvariƒáa). His main target were the Radicals, as well as Nikola Pa≈°iƒá and Stojan Protiƒá as heads of the party. Pa≈°iƒá was a \\"thug\\", \\"scumbag\\", \\"villain\\" and, ultimately, \\"the most corrupt person in the entire history of Serbia\\", and when his son Radomir was beaten, Belgrade Daily wrote that \\"this act of the youth of the nation in Novi Sad is understandable and must be fully approved\\". His journalistic writing style in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was inflammatory, and his scandalous articles were criticized by many, so much that he was even compared with the influential American newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst. In 1929 Cicvariƒá started working in Balkan, owned by Svetolik Saviƒá. Besides journalism, he sold herbs used for treating cancer, tuberculosis, epilepsy, and anthrax. Since Pa≈°iƒá had already died, Cicvariƒá's main target was president of the Croatian Peasant Party, Vlatko Maƒçek who he calls a \\"Jewish bastard\\", and a \\"long-nose\\". In his text \\"To Serbs of the Faith of Moses\\" from 29 April 1936 Cicvariƒá writes that \\"the Jews have ruined our Slavic motherland, Russia, and have spread their evil across the world\\" and states support for Adolf Hitler. He spent the final years of his life living in Belgrade, almost completely blind. From May 1940 to March 1941, Saviƒá and Cicvariƒá published the New Balkan (Novi Balkan), an antisemitic paper sympathetic to Hitler. In 1944 he writes Apprehension and death Cicvariƒá was accused of collaborationism and shot without trial during the night between October 30 and 31, 1944. His burial site remains unknown. Works Cicvariƒá wrote only a couple of books in philosophy, and most of his works were political. He was a columnist in a lot of newspapers and was a fierce critic of the Serbian philosopher and scientist Branislav Petronijeviƒá. His entire life was devoted to writing books on anarchism and critique of the Western civilization. He was a fierce opponent of monarchism, communism, social democracy and imperialism. * Iz –∞narhistiƒçkog progr–∞m–∞, Nov–∞ ≈°t–∞mp–∞rij–∞ S.

Early life and education  Born in Lexington, Kentucky, Schultze was educated at Lexington and in Cassel, Germany. In Ripley, Ohio, he joined up with a group of traveling actors for a brief period. He sold his first drawing in Chicago for four dollars and soon was drawing regularly for the Chicago News during the late 1880s.

Because its location in an alpine tundra ecosystem called p√°ramo, they often undergo a sudden and drastic change in a daily freeze-and-thaw cycle, sometimes described as \\"summer every day and winter every night.\\" Ground frost refers to the various coverings of ice produced by the direct deposition of water vapor on objects and trees, whose surfaces have a temperature below the freezing point of water (0 ¬∞C, 32 ¬∞F).  Types  The three main types of ground frost are radiation frost (hoar frost), advection frost (advection hoar frost) and evaporation frost. The latter is a rare type which occurs when surface moisture evaporates into drier air causing its temperature at the surface to fall at or under the freezing point of water. Rime (both soft and hard) is technically not a type of ground frost.  Alternative definition  Ground frost may also refer to the condition when the temperature of the upper layer of the soil falls below the freezing point of water.  In England  From 1906 to 1960 the Met Office practice was to base the number of days of ground frost on this criterion: a day with a minimum temperature reaching 30 ¬∞F (‚àí1 ¬∞C), probably because 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C) was not considered enough cold to cause damage to growing plants. Since 1961 the statistics have referred to the number of days with grass minimum temperature below 0¬∞C. Occasionally, the term ground frost can still be seen, but it means simply a minimum temperature below 0 ¬∞C.

The film was not initially planned to be a romantic comedy, but the screenplay was altered on a late stage of production when Milla Jovovich agreed to act in the film. Jovovich said in an interview that she agreed to act in the film because of her friendship with Ivan Urgant. Scenes with her participation took 10 days to film. Russian-speaking Milla Jovovich voiced her role herself, and it was her first role in the language. Although half Russian, Jovovich moved to London as a child, which made her main language English, so she had some difficulties with learning her lines. Her mother, Galina Loginova, also appears in the film. She plays Galina Alexandrovna, Nadya's mother. Most of the film was shot in Yeysk, Krasnodar Krai. The first letters of the names of the actors who played in the film starring (Khabensky, Urgant, Jovovich) form an obscene word in Russian. In one of the trailers of the film this is visible.

The British captured her at the Action of 8 January 1780 and took her into the Royal Navy as HMS St. Fermin. The Spanish Navy recaptured her in 1781 and put it into service with the same name until it was excluded in 1785. History St Fermin was a 16-gun armed merchantman that belonged to the Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas. On 8 January 1780 she was under the command of Captain J. Vin. Eloy Sanchez and was sailing with a merchant convoy of the company. A British fleet under Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney intercepted the convoy at Cape Finisterre and captured it on 8 June. Rodney sent to Britain the vessels of the convoy that were carrying commercial goods, with the captured 64-gun ship Guipuzcoano providing the escort. Rodney took with him for the relief of Gibraltar those vessels that carried naval supplies, together with the two smaller captured escorts, Saint Fermin and . The British commissioned San Fermin in Gibraltar as the 16-gun sloop of war HMS St Fermin, under Commander Jonathan Faulknor. Despite Rodney's delivery of supplies and reinforcements, Spain's siege of Gibraltar continued. At 1am on 7 June the Spanish launched an attack on Gibraltar by seven fireships. Boats from St Fermin helped tow some of these to where they could do no harm. By the firelight the British observed that some Spanish warships were waiting outside to intercept any British vessels that might try to escape. None did and the attack failed completely. On 19 October St Fermin exchanged shots with some Spanish gunboats. St Fermin was not harmed. On the evening of the 3 April 1781 St Fermin sailed from Gibraltar to Menorca with dispatches, together with the tender to , and a settee. At the time, the British maintained contact with the British forces there, at least until 1782 when that island fell, by sending small, fast- sailing ships to run the blockade. On the way to Menorca, about 10 miles off M√°laga, St Fermin was captured after a chase by two Spanish xebecs the next day. Her captors took her to Cartagena, Spain. She then served the Spanish Navy until decommissioned in 1785.

History The band name was picked out of a short list of names without further meaning (It was also the name of a BBC documentary on the outlaw emerald miners of the Colombian city Muzo). Pretty much bored of what was going on musically back then, they chose to seek the gut feeling of rock music again. Anti- shoe gazing rock music with lots of electric guitar and organ. On the first album The Birthday Party influences are still evident, but as from the second album APOGEE, the style becomes more melodic and very 60's influenced. In 10 years time 7 albums and 5 singles were released and numerous gigs and tours through the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and especially France had followed. They were also the first Dutch rock band to play at SXSW in Austin Texas in 1990. At the end of the 90s the Miners paused. Feeling it was time for a break. Keyboard player Dan was no longer in the band and lives in Amsterdam. Marc had been playing with American singer Pat Mears but returned to the band in 95. For a while they called themselves Funrazor to see if it was possible to start with a clean slate without any legacy. But then after 2 years they returned to the original name again and started to build a recording studio in their own rehearsal garage. When the studio became better equipped new songs were recorded and the songs from those years are captured in a double CD \\"Love & Life part II\\" which is only available as a download on their website. Hans left the country shortly after that and has a new life as a farmer in France. Since 2010 The Miners started playing live again occasionally and they were joined by guitarist Wannes Rombouts and drummer Kasper Dam. The long-awaited new album: \\"Really...is that a fact\\" has been self-released as a promo in January 2013. Early December 2013 original drummer GJ suffered a fatal heart attack and died sadly. Due to lack of time and other obligations, Wannes Rombouts is no longer active with the Miners. At the same time Miners of Muzo is playing again as HOLY JOE & the ALCOHOLITES, an alter ego band about Joe the Rock'n Roll Bishop. A band which only plays 60s garage songs, mainly covers (something they always have been doing alongside the Miners material). Lead guitar is played by 19 year old Frankie Lamberts aka Frankie Fuzz. In 2017 Hans Vroom returned to pick up the guitar again. In the summer of 2017 The Miners of Muzo (reunited with Hans on guitar) played a few concerts in the South of France. In 2018 new concerts have been confirmed including at The Go Wild festival and at the Down at the Nightclub festival. In 2016 the Miners of Muzo resumed recording new material. In 2017 The Miners of Muzo appeared on the compilation album Down at the Nightclub vol.1 and released two CDs, Really is that a Fact and Love & Life Part II.

It's up to Kao to drive the invaders from his home and save his family. The game is divided into 5 sections \\"worlds\\" each with a distinctive theme (winter, space, tropic etc.) however, the sequence of levels often makes little to no sense, for example, a battle with some kind of Greek god (Zeus, probably) transitions into a level in outer space. Release The game was marketed worldwide by Titus Interactive, both for PC's and for Sega Dreamcast console, although in Poland the game was exclusively released on the PC, where it was released by Licomp Empik Multimedia. It scored a major success, exceeding 45,000 copies in Poland alone where it remained in the Top 10 for a considerable time.

As an active thrust fault it constitutes a seismic hazard zone for the densely populated Santiago. A large number of homes and educational centers have been built on or near the fault, along with a gas plant in Pe√±alol√©n. The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission has a reactor in La Reina, very close to the fault, which has raised concerns among the population. It runs 5 kilometers underground and extends for 25 kilometers in a north-south direction, lying between the Mapocho River and Maipo River. It's known to pass underneath the communes of Vitacura, Las Condes, La Reina, Pe√±alol√©n, La Florida and Puente Alto, and suspected to continue into Lo Barnechea and Pirque at its extremes. Due to its shallowness, it can cause very destructive superficial earthquakes with a magnitude around 7 on the Richter scale, with a general recurrence period of over 300 years.  Geological behavior  The San Ram√≥n is a thrust fault with vertical slippage which has caused the formation of the Sierra de Ram√≥n, a 25 kilometer long mountain chain with a maximum height of 3249 meters above sea level. This range has moved noticeably in the last 10 million years, and grown notably during the recent Quaternary period, which makes it a geologically active fault. It shows traces of deformation on the order of 0,02 mm/year, making it capable of producing significant earthquakes, such as in 1575 and 1647. The fault represents a discontinuity in the rocky subsoil which modifies its characteristics by fragmenting the rock, generating fault ruptures, dislocation and fracturing of blocks in the immediate surroundings, and even generating hot springs which chemically alter the rock.

Originally, the plan included only seven Jews, but this was later increased to fourteen.

Amnesty International described her as \\"a leading human rights defender in Southern Thailand\\". Husband's disappearance In the early-2000s, southern Thailand suffered a wave of unrest, including an ethnic separatist insurgency. In 2003, four Thai Muslims (Waemahadi Wae-dao, a doctor; Maisuru Haji Abdulloh, a school owner; his son, Muyahid; and a manual labourer, Samarn Wae-kaji) were arrested and charged with planning bombings for the militant Islamic organization Jemaah Islamiyah. Angkhana's husband, Somchai, their defense attorney, accused state security forces of having abused and tortured the men in custody. Angkhana reported harassment and threats by police. On 24 March 2004, a group of men seized Somchai as he left a hotel in a Bangkok suburb, forcing him into a vehicle. He has not been seen since. Investigation and trial Angkhana pursued a court case against the officers she alleged to responsible for her husband's disappearance, but was frustrated at what she perceived to be a government cover-up. Police officials refused to share relevant records with her, citing national security, leading the New York Times to describe the truth as \\"hidden behind a wall of official obscurity.\\" Angkhana also reported a police harassment and anonymous threats, recalling those allegedly sent to her husband before his disappearance. She eventually filed a complaint with the United Nations, in which she stated, \\"We do not see any genuine goodwill from the authorities.\\" In 2006, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra stated that Somchai Neelaphaijit was dead and may have been killed by state security forces. On 12 January 2006, one policeman was jailed for having \\"illegally detained\\" Somchai, but four others were acquitted. Angkhana and several international human rights groups \\"denounced the verdict.\\" On 2 August 2009, bone fragments were found in the Mae Klong River believed to belong to Somchai. In September 2010, more than six years after her husband's disappearance, Angkhana told reporters, \\"I haven't given up my attempts to call for justice for my husband ... No matter which party controls the government, I ask it to help investigate the case.\\" On 17 March 2011, after several delays, a Thai appeals court acquitted Ngern Thongsuk, the only convicted defendant in the case, saying that it had not been conclusively determined whether Somchai had died. Following the verdict, Angkhana told reporters she \\"would continue to fight for justice and take the case to the Supreme Court.\\" The Asian Human Rights Commission condemned the verdict and renewed calls for police to investigate continued threats against Angkhana and her family. On 30 April 2019, the National Human Rights Commission (Thailand) began a disciplinary inquiry of Angkhana on the basis of political partiality accusations. The Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that the inquiry focused on her role observing legal proceedings and documenting rights violations against opposition politicians. HRW's Asia director Brad Adams said, \\"Thailand's rights commission is sinking to a new low by seeking to punish Angkhana for doing her job by exposing rights abuses and demanding accountability. The commission‚Äôs leadership has repeatedly failed to hold the military government to its human rights obligations, but it appears now to be doing the junta's dirty work.\\" Ongoing work and recognition Angkhana currently serves as the chairwoman of the Working Group for Justice and Peace, and continues to investigate allegations of police abuse in southern Thailand. Amnesty International and Front Line report that her safety continues to be threatened, and in 2009, her car was robbed of documents relating to one of her cases. In 2006, Angkhana, along with Malalai Joya of Afghanistan, won the Gwangju Prize for Human Rights, which honors \\"individuals, groups or institutions in Korea and abroad that have contributed in promoting and advancing human rights, democracy and peace through their work\\". The award cited her \\"unrelenting\\" efforts for justice and \\"unsparing\\" criticism of government authorities. On 11 March 2011, she received the Asian Human Rights Defender Award of the Asian Human Rights Commission on her husband's behalf; the award's press release also praised her \\"role as an articulate and courageous spokesperson for the families of disappeared persons in Thailand\\". In 2011, Josefina Bergsten's documentary UNJUST, which prominently features Angkhana's story, was given a Special Jury Award at the Hague's Movies that Matter Festival. In 2016, Angkhana was appointed to the Thai National Human Rights Commission. She resigned from the commission in 2019, along with Commissioner Tuenjai Deetes, citing restrictive regulations and a hostile and environment. In November 2019, Angkhana was sued for criminal defamation by Thammakaset Co., Ltd., a poultry company in Lopburi Province. She is accused of sharing two posts about alleged Thammakaset labour abuses that contained links to the press statements of 16 organizations.

The Munich-born American historian Konrad Heiden was one of the first to document this phenomenon in his 1936 book Hitler: A Biography, remarking that within the Sturmabteilung (Brownshirts, SA) ranks there were \\"large numbers of Communists and Social Democrats\\" and that \\"many of the storm troops were called 'beefsteaks' ‚Äì brown outside and red within.\\" The switching of political parties was at times so common that SA men would jest that \\"[i]n our storm troop there are three Nazis, but we shall soon have spewed them out.\\" The term was particularly used for working class members of the SA who were aligned with Strasserism. The term derived from the idea that these individuals were like a \\"beefsteak\\"‚Äîbrown on the outside and red on the inside, with \\"brown\\" referring to the colour of the uniforms and \\"red\\" to their communist and socialist sympathies. The implication of this was that their allegiance to Nazism was superficial and opportunistic. After Adolf Hitler became Germany's Chancellor, beefsteak Nazis continued during the suppression of both the Communists and the Socialists (represented by the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, respectively) in the 1930s and the term was popular as early as 1933.  Ernst R√∂hm and the Sturmabteilung  Ernst R√∂hm, a co-founder of the SA and later its commander, had developed within the SA ranks an \\"expanding R√∂hm-cult\\", where many in the SA sought a revolutionary socialist regime, radicalizing the SA. R√∂hm and large segments of the Nazi Party supported the 25-point National Socialist Program for its socialist, revolutionary and anti-capitalist positions, expecting Hitler to fulfill his promises when power was finally achieved. Since R√∂hm had \\"considerable sympathy with the more socialist aspects of the Nazi programme\\", \\"turncoat Communists and Socialists joined the Nazi Party for a number of years, where they were derisively known as 'Beefsteak Nazis'.\\" R√∂hm radicalization came to the forefront in 1933‚Äì1934 when he sought to have his plebeian SA troopers engage in permanent or \\"second revolution\\" after Hitler had become Germany's Chancellor. This second revolution would be \\"not against the Left, but against the Right\\", an idea that found favor with Joseph Goebbels‚Äîthe Nazi Gauleiter (party leader) of Berlin and later Propaganda Minister‚Äîat least according to his diary. With 2.5 million Stormtroopers under his command by late 1933, R√∂hm envisaged a purging of the conservative faction, the \\"Reaktion\\" in Germany that would entail more nationalization of industry, \\"worker control of the means of production\\" and the \\"confiscation and redistribution of property and wealth of the upper classes.\\" Such ideological and political infighting within the Nazi Party prompted Hitler to have the political rival R√∂hm and other Nazi socialist radicals executed during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934. Some have argued that since most SA members came from working-class families or were unemployed, they were more amenable to Marxist-leaning socialism. However, historian Thomas Friedrich reports that the repeated efforts by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) to appeal to the working-class backgrounds of the SA were \\"doomed to failure\\" because most SA men were focused on the cult of Hitler and destroying the \\"Marxist enemy.\\" As a former Marxist in his early years, Goebbels once stated \\"how thin the dividing line\\" was between communism and Nazism, which had caused many Red Front Fighters to \\"switch to the SA.\\"  Extent  In some cities, the numeral strength of party-switching beefsteak Nazis was estimated to be large. Rudolf Diels (the head of the Gestapo from 1933 to 1934) reported that \\"70 percent\\" of the new SA recruits had been Communists in the city of Berlin.

Career Michael Bellusci grew up in Flushing, Queens, in New York City. As a young child, he played guitar at 8 years old then drums at 10. At a very early age he befriended Kasey Smith. The two shared an interest in music, as Smith played keyboards, while Bellusci played drums. Bellusci and Smith played in a cover bands for a number of years, from 1976 to 1980. In 1980, Smith and Bellusci formed the Jazz/Rock/Fusion group Get With It. They had minor success in 1981, but unfortunately the band never received a record deal, despite their following in the New York area. By the end of 1986, Get With It disbanded, and Smith would join Danger Danger. In 1987, Bellusci joined up with some local musicians and began playing electronic drums in a house band at a local bar in Bayside, NY named Blossoms. One of those musicians was Mark \\"Farquar\\" Vaccacio, who portrayed John Lennon as an original member of The Broadway Cast of Beatlemania. Two other Beatlemania Alumni, Les Fradkin, who was the original George Harrison on Broadway and Don Linares, who played Paul McCartney, did a short run on Broadway before going on the road, also performed regularly with The Conglomowitz. While playing with The Conglomowitz, Bellusci was selected to portray Ringo with the touring cast of the show. He performed with this show for over a decade while also performing as Ringo with a Beatles Tribute Band, Strawberry Fields, based in New York City. Also while playing at Blossoms, Bellusci began playing with a group that became Wonderous Stories, a Long Island-based cover band that plays Prog Rock and many other types of material. Bellusci left the group after a few years to go on the road, but continues to work with this group to this day, as a sub for the new drummer. Bellusci and Smith reconnected musically in 2006, forming Shock. They reworked their old material, while in Get With It, and recorded new material. In 2009, Bellusci was approached by Les Fradkin to play drums with the newly reformed version of Edison Lighthouse for recording and touring. This project never produced any music or live dates. Bellusci currently plays bass, guitar, ukulele and drums as a freelance musician in the New York City area. He has played drums for a George Harrison Tribute program called \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", which was a multi media presentation with narration by noted author Joshua Greene.

He began music lessons with his father and continued his education with Ruperto Chap√≠ and Tom√°s Bret√≥n.

As a conductor of the Sociedad de Conciertos de Cadiz, Videgain helped cultivate the tastes of audiences in Cadiz for symphonic music. According to \\"those who have seem him conduct and have transmitted to us the memory of his performances of great strength and great enthusiasm. he obtained with imperceptible gestures what he wanted from the orchestra.\\" Videgain also collaborated with the leading authors of sainetes (a comic genre found in Spanish theatre), including Salvador Videgain G√≥mez, Antonio Reparaz, the Quintero brothers, Joaqu√≠n Arqu√©s, and Rafael Calleja, also writers to obtain the libretti for his zarzuelas. He co-wrote the music of a number of his works with others conductor, who hailed him the \\"musician of impossible\\" because of his sense of rhythm and easy melodies. His careful musical education in his learning leads him to learn from the best teachers, Reparaz, Chap√≠, Bret√≥n, Chueca... so he had the ease of composing numbers with great ease, although he hardly exploited this facet for his not too numerous works if they were opportune to release on designated dates thus saving companies from not having fresh works to show to the public and so we could see it, because almost all of their works were composed for that purpose. Unlike his parents who had the family opposition to start his career because they seemed social madness at that time, he counted from the first moment of the support and prestige of his parents, supporting his decision to direct his future in music, so different was that the first company that had its own was with capital directly contributed by them. Works In 1895, wrote A vuela Pluma, based on a text by E. de Mar√≠a journalist-director of The Fog√≥n Buenos Aires, and in 1898 El vals coqueto in San Sebasti√°n.

The Finish The famous parents Antonia Garc√≠a de Videgain and Salvador Videgain G√≥mez and his brother Salvador Videgain are more important us him but his music was his moment. Beyond dramatic works for the stage, Videgain also wrote one cadenzas to Beethoven's Violin Concerto. Towards the end of his life, He lived in a precarious economic situation due to the Second World War, but he could alleviate it by obtaining the chair of chapel musician.

The hotel, originally opened in 1924, is located in a grand colonial building and has been described as \\"the Grand Dame of all Nassau hotels\\", \\"the most elegant and most expensive hotel in town\\", and \\"the most distinctive and pleasant of the island's large hotels\\". History of the area The site was occupied in the 19th century by the Old Fort of Nassau to protect the western entrance to the Nassau Harbour until it was demolished in 1873. Long before the fort was built, the first settlement was established here in 1666, when Nassau was known as Charles town, which had developed in a haphazard manner lined with brothels and taverns visited by pirates, cheats and vagabonds. The presence of pirates in the town caused attacks by Spaniards when the town people fled to American colonies. The town was rebuilt later with a fort and called Nassau, on the site now occupied by the Hotel. The town was attacked again in 1703 by the allied forces of the French and the Spanish who destroyed the fort. Piracy was decimated when the British Governor Woodes Rogers took over in 1718. Over the next two centuries, the town developed under American influence during the 18th and 19th century witnessing glamour and many buildings of architectural excellence being built with slave labour. It was not until the Greeks came in the 20th century to man the sponging industry that rich started frequenting the island. Prohibition in USA encouraged at that time (1920 to 1933) the GIs and tourist to visit the island for hooch. It was during this period that major hotels started coming up like the British Colonial Hotel and Fort Montagu, which initially operated for three months during the winter season till the Washington Ball was celebrated. Hotel history The Colonial Hotel, circa 1913 In 1900, the land was purchased by Henry M. Flagler, responsible for the Breakers Hotel in South Florida. He built an enormous wooden hotel on the site, the Colonial Hotel, which opened in 1901. On March 31, 1922 the hotel was gutted by fire. The Bahamian government gave a loan to the Munson Line, which purchased the land and built a brand new seven-story hotel, The New Colonial, on the site within six months. The hotel celebrated its grand opening on January 7, 1924. In 1932, the hotel was purchased by Sir Harry Oakes. The local legend is that Oakes bought the hotel on a whim, after experiencing bad service there. Oakes renamed the hotel the British Colonial Hotel. He was a powerful man and a friend of the Duke of Windsor. He was later murdered in 1943 under mysterious circumstances (the mystery remains unresolved), which was called the \\"murder of the century\\". The hotel was bought by Florida-based Gill Hotels in 1960 and became part of Sheraton Hotels in November 1962 as the Sheraton British Colonial, the chain's fourth ever franchise. Sheraton operated the hotel until 1989, when it became part of Best Western Hotels as the British Colonial Beach Resort. The old hotel building was gradually closed up over the course of the 1990s, with rooms eventually operating in only a small portion of the complex. Finally, in 1997 it was purchased by RHK, who renovated it at a cost of over $90 million. They completely gutted and modernized the interiors, but retained its fa√ßade of towers, galleries, and molded reliefs. Since the hotel reopened in 1999 it has been managed by Hilton Hotels as the British Colonial Hilton Nassau. It was renovated in June 2009 at a cost of US$15 million, The hotel was sold on October 24, 2014 to the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. From 2016-2019, the group constructed a $250 million complex, originally known as The Pointe, adjacent to the British Colonial, located on the hotel's former parking lot. The hotel and condominium towers of The Pointe have since been branded as Margaritaville Beach Resort Nassau. Interior View from the hotel's private beach On one side of the hotel is a tropical garden and the pool overlooking the harbor. The main restaurants are Aqua, serving international cuisine and Portofino serving Italian-Caribbean fusion cuisine, and the Bullion Bar serves drinks and snacks. The lobby is luxurious, with marble titles and antiques and features the Blackbeard‚Äôs Cove Lobby bar and nightly Bahamian/Caribbean music. All of the rooms are decorated in colonial d√©cor. A relief depicting Christopher Columbus is situated high on the grand central tower of the hotel, and at the front of the hotel is a statue of Woodes Rogers, the ex-privateer who proved effective against piracy in the area. A mural depicting the history of the Bahamas was added in 1999 to the entrance hall. Facilities The hotel has six floors spread over an 8-acre plot and has 288 guest rooms, 20 suites and 47 executive-level rooms. It has a 300-foot-long private white sand beach which features complimentary kayaking and snorkeling. The hotel has been fully modernised with new electronics and furnishings. The executive lounge is located on the top floor provided with of space. James Bond The hotel was used as a filming location for the James Bond film Never Say Never Again, starring Sean Connery.

He is best known for his advocacy of the Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship, which asserts that Francis Bacon was the author of Shakespeare's plays. He published a number of books on the subject and promoted public debates with the academic community. At his death he donated the large \\"Edwin Durning-Lawrence archive\\" to London University. Life He was born Edwin Lawrence, the seventh son and last child of William Lawrence and Jane Clarke. His father, who built up his fortune in construction, held political posts in London. His brothers Sir William Lawrence and Sir James Lawrence were Lord Mayors of London and also members of parliament. His nephew was Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, the suffragette and pacifist MP. Edwin studied law at London University and was admitted to Middle Temple in 1867 as a barrister. Later in his career he became a Justice of the Peace (as his father had been) in Berkshire. In 1895 he was elected to the House of Commons for the Liberal Unionist Party, becoming a member of parliament for Truro from 1895 to 1906. He was also a prominent Unitarian.

The History of Essex Hall. London: Lindsey Press, 1959. He married Edith Jane Smith, daughter of John Benjamin Smith, in 1874. Their only son, Edwin, was born in 1878, but died two days later. On 2 February 1898 Edwin changed his name by Royal Licence to Durning-Lawrence, in honour of his wife's maternal grandfather, and was created 1st Baronet Durning-Lawrence, of King's Ride, Ascot in the County of Berkshire and of Carlton House Terrace in the County of London on 10 March the same year. In the absence of a male heir, on his death, his baronetcy became extinct.L. G. Pine, The New Extinct Peerage 1884‚Äì1971: Containing Extinct, Abeyant, Dormant and Suspended Peerages With Genealogies and Arms, London: Heraldry Today, 1972, p. 217 Writings Durning-Lawrence was a prolific author. He wrote The Progress of a Century; or, The Age of Iron and Steam (1886), The Pope and the Bible (1888) and A Short History of Lighting from the Earliest Times (1895). Lawrence became most famous as an advocate of Baconian theory, to which he was converted after reading Ignatius L. Donnelly's The Great Cryptogram. He wrote a number of books on the topic, the most notable of which was Bacon is Shake-Speare (1910). He also wrote The Shakespeare Myth (1912), \\"Macbeth\\" Proves Bacon is Shakespeare (1913), and Key to Milton's Epitaph on Shakespeare (1914). Following Donnelly, Durning-Lawrence believed that the key to proving Bacon's authorship was the discovery of cyphers within the plays which were hidden there by Bacon. His writings were also notable for the virulence with which he heaped abuse on William Shakespeare of Stratford: > England is now declining any longer to dishonour and defame the greatest > Genius of all time by continuing to identify him with the mean, drunken, > ignorant, and absolutely unlettered, rustic of Stratford who never in his > life wrote so much as his own name and in all probability was totally unable > to read one single line of print.Durning-Lawrence, E., Bacon is Shakespeare, > p. 82 Durning-Lawrence's vehemence and assertiveness in promoting his views was widely remarked upon. He sent copies of his book to public libraries in Britain and to schools, prompting expressions of concern from Shakespeare scholars who believed unwary readers would be misled. Durning-Lawrence's most famous argument in Bacon is Shake-Speare was his suggestion that the word Honorificabilitudinitatibus, used in the play Love's Labour's Lost, is an anagram for hi ludi, F. Baconis nati, tuiti orbi, Latin for \\"these plays, F. Bacon's offspring, are preserved for the world\\".Baconian theory. encyclopedia.com He derived the argument from an earlier book by Isaac Hull Platt.K. K. Ruthven, Faking Literature, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.102 Samuel Schoenbaum later argued that the anagram overlooks the fact that Bacon would have written the genitive of his name as Baconi (from Baconus), never Baconis (which assumes his name was Baco).Samuel Schoenbaum, 'Shakespeare's Lives, Oxford University Press, 2nd ed.1991 p.421 John Sladek also showed that the word could also be anagrammatised as I, B.

Leslie and Benjamin Griffin (5 March 2003) Transcription of early letter forms in rare materials cataloging . Prepared for the DCRM Conference, 10‚Äì13 March 2003 Durning-Lawrence also claimed that the Droeshout engraving of Shakespeare contained visual codes pointing to the secret authorship. He wrote, \\"there is no question ‚Äì there can be no possible question ‚Äì that in fact it is a cunningly drawn cryptographic picture, shewing two left arms and a mask... Especially note that the ear is a mask ear and stands out curiously; note also how distinct the line shewing the edge of the mask appears.\\"Durning-Lawrence also claims that other engravings by Droeshout \\"may be similarly correctly characterised as cunningly composed, in order to reveal the true facts of the authorship of such works, unto those who were capable of grasping the hidden meaning of his engravings.\\" Edwin Durning- Lawrence, Bacon Is Shake-Speare, John McBride Co., New York, 1910, pp. 23, 79‚Äì80.

In the 1920s the artist Henry Tonks, who felt the need for a stronger presence of History of Art within the university, was able to convert the endowment into a chair in that discipline at University College, despite the fact that Durning-Lawrence himself had no especial interest in the subject (though he had donated thirteen paintings to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1901). The first holder of the Durning- Lawrence chair was Tancred Borenius.University College, History of Art department . ucl.ac.uk Wilmot controversy In 1932, the year after the library was opened, the Shakespeare scholar Allardyce Nicoll published an article on a manuscript it contained written by James Corton Cowell, entitled \\"Some reflections on the life of William Shakespeare\\". The manuscript was a lecture delivered to the Ipswich Philosophic Society in 1805. It stated that an 18th-century clergyman, James Wilmot, had identified Bacon as the hidden author of Shakespeare's works. Wilmot's study of local history in the Stratford area convinced him that Shakespeare could not have authored the works attributed to him. He came to this conclusion in 1781, more than 80 years before the Baconian argument was first published by Delia Bacon and W.H. Smith.Nichol, A, \\"The First Baconian\\", Times Literary Supplement, 25 February 1932, p. 128. Reply by William Jaggard, 3 March, p. 155; response from Nicoll, 10 March, p. 17.

The authenticity of Cowell's \\"Reflections\\" was accepted by Shakespearean scholars for many years, but was challenged in 2002‚Äì2003 by John Rollett, Daniel Wright and Alan H. Nelson. Rollett could find no historical traces of Cowell, the Ipswich Philosophic Society, or its supposed president, Arthur Cobbold.Niederkorn, William S. \\"Absolute Will\\", The Brooklyn Rail (April 2010); Baca, Nathan. \\"Wilmot Did Not; The 'First' Authorship Story Called Possible Baconian Hoax\\", Shakespeare Matters 2 (Summer 2003), ; Brenda James, W.

The system was the second cyclone and the only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively quiet 2011‚Äì12 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Jasmine developed from an area of disturbed weather on 1 February in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula. As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and Jasmine began to strengthen at a faster rate. Steadily intensifying, Jasmine reached peak intensity on 8 February as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale, while beginning to show annular characteristics. The next day Jasmine entered an area of vertical wind shear, which consequently weakened the cyclone and caused its eye to expand. A high-pressure area south of Jasmine later steered the weakening cyclone to the northeast on 12 February. Although it entered an area of warmer sea surface temperatures, Jasmine subsequently entered extratropical transition and later degenerated into an extratropical cyclone on 16 February, and later dissipated completely on 19 February. Cyclone Jasmine affected five countries during its existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland. Jasmine also brought rainfall to areas of the Solomon Islands. As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region. In Vanuatu, heavy rains and wind from Jasmine destroy numerous crops. Banana trees in particular are affected by the cyclone. Jasmine inundated areas of Tonga that had already been affected by Cyclone Cyril just a week prior. Nuku'alofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24‚Äëhour span due to rains associated with the cyclone. After the season, the name Jasmine was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names. Meteorological history During 31 January the Australian Bureau of Meteorology started to monitor a tropical low, that had developed within the monsoon trough over the western Cape York Peninsula. Over the next day the system moved into the southeastern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, before it moved back over the Cape York Peninsula during 2 February. The system subsequently emerged into the Coral Sea to the north of Cairns later that day, where a strong northwest monsoon flow with gales developed to the north of the low. The system subsequently moved eastwards and intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. On 1 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Brisbane tropical cyclone warning centre (TCWC Brisbane) and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to monitor a tropical low that had developed within a monsoon trough about to the north of Mornington Island. Over the next two days the low moved eastwards and passed over the Cape York Peninsula before it emerged into the Coral Sea to the north of Cairns. After emerging into the Coral Sea the low continued to develop, and on 4 February, the JTWC and TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had become a tropical cyclone with the latter naming it as Jasmine while it was located about to the east of Cairns. Tracking eastward, Jasmine entered a flow of dry air, which prevented the storm from strengthening quickly at the time. On 5 February, the low‚Äìlevel atmospheric circulation center of Jasmine became exposed due to the presence of strong vertical wind shear. However, the cyclone was able to maintain its intensity due to the existence of an area of moisture over Australia. Throughout the rest of the day, the wind shear subdued, and the system began to organize as convective banding wrapped around the center. As a result, Cyclone Jasmine intensified into the equivalent of a Category 2 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), sustained for 10 minutes. The next day, Cyclone Jasmine began to track to the east-southeast in response to a strengthening subtropical ridge. The cyclone continued to steadily intensify as convection continued to wrap tightly around the center of Jasmine. At the same time, the storm moved out of the BOM's area of responsibility and into the area of responsibility of the Fiji Meteorological Service's (FMS) tropical cyclone warning center at Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi). alt=Satellite image of a rather disorganized tropical cyclone, with ragged banding features and a disorganized center of circulation. Late on 7 February, while still tracking to the east-southeast, Jasmine rapidly intensified, with wind speeds increasing to 185 km/h (115 mph), sustained for one minute. The cyclone developed a ragged eye stretching 40 km (25 mi) across. Later that day, Jasmine reached its peak intensity as it passed 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast of New Caledonia, with wind speeds of 215 km/h (135 mph), equivalent to a Category 4 cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir- Simpson hurricane scales (SSHS). Throughout 8 February, Jasmine began to show characteristics of an annular hurricane, maintaining a large, asymmetric eye and rather shallow convective features. In addition, multiple eyewall mesovorticies developed within the eye. However, Jasmine did not maintain its peak intensity for an extended period of time. By 9 February, the cloud tops surrounding Jasmine began to warm, and thus weakened. In addition, the cyclone began to enter cooler SSTs. Although Jasmine's convective bands continued to thin out, the cyclone maintained a gradually expanding eyewall and remained a compact system. By 10 February, the eyewall of Cyclone Jasmine measured 95 km (60 mi) in diameter. The next day, the subtropical ridge that had been forcing Jasmine toward the southeast had weakened, and as a result the cyclone began to track east-northeast, toward a weakness in the ridge. The storm continued to disorganize, with its eye later becoming cloud‚Äìfilled. By the end of 11 February, Jasmine had already weakened to a cyclone with wind speeds of just 85 km/h (50 mph), sustained for one minute, due to the presence of strong vertical wind shear. The low‚Äìlevel circulation center of Jasmine became partly exposed for a period of time on 12 February, before convection redeveloped over the center. As a weakening cyclone, Jasmine only maintained an area of weak convection displaced to its east as it approached Tonga. On 13 February, convection re-developed and later strengthened over Jasmine's center of circulation due to the presence of the South Pacific convergence zone and warm SSTs. Cyclone Jasmine was able to attain a secondary peak intensity of 85 km/h (50 mph), sustained for one minute, as the system's banding features became better defined. Due to Jasmine's position between two anticyclones, the cyclone erratically moved in a loop in the vicinity of Tonga from 14 to 15 February, before moving to the southeast. The system later exited the favorable conditions and moved into an area of strong wind shear once again. Convection became sheared apart and Jasmine's center of circulation once again became ill-defined and exposed. Late on 15 February, the JTWC issued their last advisory on the system, and on the next day, RSMC Nadi reported that Cyclone Jasmine had degenerated into an extratropical cyclone. Preparations and impact alt=Satellite image of a disorganized cluster of thunderstorms, showing some rotation. During its existence, parts of Queensland, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga were affected by Cyclone Jasmine. The name Jasmine was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names after the season by the World Meteorological Organization, and was replaced by the name Jenna. Queensland Early in its existence, Jasmine produced numerous rain showers over northern areas of Queensland. Gusty winds in Weipa, Queensland from Jasmine damaged trees on 2 February. A strong rainband associated with the cyclone produced heavy rainfalls over southern parts of Queensland. After Jasmine entered the Coral Sea, a surface trough extending from the cyclone produced rainfall over coastal areas of eastern Australia. In Cairns, Queensland, several roads were closed due to severe weather associated with the cyclone, and trees were uprooted by strong winds. Power lines in the northern suburbs of Cairns were also damaged due to strong winds. Other areas of Queensland recorded rain totals in excess of . Vanuatu Prior to Cyclone Jasmine, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office was preparing for the cyclone after the storm was forecast to impact the country. The aid agency Oxfam prepared for food and water shortages, using the previous year's severe weather to gauge potential impacts from Cyclone Jasmine. The Save the Children Fund prepared materials prior to the cyclone that could supply area schools with materials, known as a \\"school- in-a-box.\\" People in affected areas were evacuated to care centers prior to the storm. Within Vanuatu, gale-force winds caused damage to crops, houses and water systems. Across the southern islands of Vanuatu, Jasmine impacted the area with winds of . Warnings for maritime activities including small craft warnings were issued for areas offshore the islands. The cyclone produced rough seas at Port Vila, Vanuatu. Damage associated with Jasmine was mostly of agricultural nature, primarily to crops and fruit trees. Casava and banana crops were hampered by the storm, but did not pose any threat to food security. Damage to infrastructure was reported in Tanna, though the island suffered from primarily losses to food crops. Areas that had traditions of not consuming severed crops were especially impacted by the damage to food crops. Water sources in southwest Tanna were destroyed, and other sources were contaminated from mud from runoffs. In addition, three classrooms at Enukas Primary School were destroyed by Jasmine. Aniwa Island also suffered from food damage, especially to banana and manioc crops, as well as orange trees. At Aniwa Airport, high frequency radio services were cut off. Futuna Island was also cut off due to loss of communication. At Dillon's Bay, one of Erromango's primary water sources, water became contaminated. In addition, several air strips were closed due to water logging and debris. An aerial and ground damage survey began in the southern areas of the island chain after cyclone effects had subsided. Solomon Islands Jasmine caused intense rain showers across the island chain. The Solomon Islands Meteorological Service (SIMS) issued a Tropical Cyclone Watch Advisory throughout the day for affected areas. Isabel Province reported damage to kumara vines after three days of rain from the cyclone. Pest infestations also resulted from the rains. Most of the damage in the province resulted from overflowing rivers and inundated gardens. Makira-Ulawa Province also suffered from damaged food gardens. Cocoa bean, coconut, nut, and banana crops and plantations were damaged. In addition, bridges were washed out by flooding. The ship MV Haourosi was grounded in Maro‚Äôu Bay due to high waves offshore. Tonga Jasmine brought heavy rains and flooding to Tonga, which had already been impacted by heavy rains from Cyclone Cyril just a week prior. Power outages occurred across Tonga due to the storm, but power was quickly restored. International and domestic flights in Tonga were disrupted for two days due to Jasmine. Tongatapu suffered from severe flooding. Affected families were sent to evacuation shelters. Some houses reportedly collapsed and fell into creeks due to the flooding. In Nuku'alofa, a total of 400 people were evacuated. In a 24‚Äìhour period extending from 14 February to 15 February, of rain was recorded in Nuku'alofa, equal to more than half of the city's average recorded rainfall in the month of February. On Atata Island, a resort was closed for two weeks due to damage sustained from the storm. An offshore South Korean fishing boat sunk during the storm. However, its three crew members were rescued by Tongan police. An additional two fishing boats broke away from Nuku'alofa Harbor and washed up on a nearby reef. The Tongan Ministry of Health monitored the potential for diseases after the storm, particularly in low‚Äìlying areas of the island chain, where septic leakage was a potential health threat.

Menzies led the United Australia Party in the Australian Parliament from 1939‚Äì1941. Menzies served a later and longer term as Prime Minister as leader of a successor party, the Liberal Party of Australia from 1949‚Äì1966 (see Menzies Government (1949‚Äì1966)). Background The United Australia Party (UAP) was formed in 1931 as a response to the more radical proposals of Labor Party members to deal with the Great Depression. Led by former Labor minister and fiscal conservative Joseph Lyons, the new party swept into office in 1931 against the Australian Labor Party led by James Scullin.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/elections.aspx Labor had split over the issue of economic policy, with Lang Labor seeking to cease overseas debt repayments. Lyons served seven years as Prime Minister, overseeing Australia's recovery from the Great Depression. Defence issues became increasingly dominant in public affairs with the rise of Fascism in Europe and militant Japan in Asia.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/in-office.aspx Lyons negotiated a coalition with the Country Party, led by Earle Page, following the 1934 election, however the parties continued to differ on some questions of economic policy: the Country Party wanted low tariffs and opposed introduction of a national unemployment insurance scheme.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 On 7 April 1939, with the storm clouds of the Second World War gathering in Europe and the Pacific, Joseph Lyons became the first Prime Minister of Australia to die in office, suffering a heart attack.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/after- office.aspx The UAP's Deputy leader, Robert Menzies, now openly antipathetic to Country Party leader Earle Page, had resigned in March, citing the coalition's failure to implement a plan for national insurance as the cause for his resignation. In the absence of a UAP deputy, the Governor-General, Lord Gowrie, appointed Country Party leader Earl Page as his temporary replacement, pending the selection of Lyons' successor by the UAP.Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978 The Country Party under Earle Page announced that they would refuse to work in coalition under a Menzies led government. The UAP selected Menzies to succeed Lyons regardless. Terms in office Robert Menzies was sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia for the first time on 26 April 1939, following the death of Joseph Lyons.http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150416b.htm?hilite=robert%3Bmenzies He led a minority United Australia Party government ‚Äì Country Party leader Earle Page had temporarily served as Prime Minister after the death of Lyons, but he refused to serve in a government led by Menzies, and withdrew the support of the Country Party from coalition with the UAP. In addition to the office of Prime Minister, Menzies served as Treasurer. The First Menzies Ministry included the ageing former Prime Minister Billy Hughes and the young future Prime Minister Harold Holt.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/menzies/in- office.aspx#section1 Menzies tried and failed to have the issue of national insurance examined by a committee of parliamentarians. Though no longer in formal coalition, his government survived because the Country Party preferred a UAP government to that of a Labor government. The growing threat of war dominated politics through 1939. Menzies supported British policy against Hitler's Germany (negotiate for peace, but prepare for war) and ‚Äì fearing Japanese intentions in the Pacific ‚Äì established independent embassies in Tokyo and Washington to receive independent advice about developments. On 3 September 1939, the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, made a national radio broadcast: > Australia had entered World War II. Earle Page, as leader of the Country and > John Curtin as leader of the Labor Party both pledged support to the > declaration of war. Australia was ill-prepared for war.

It was located on the southeast corner of 15th Street and Central Avenue, roughly halfway between Downtown and Old Town, and took its name from the Huning Castle mansion, which originally stood on the other side of 15th Street. Built in 1922, it was a two-story, U-shaped building with a central courtyard and 20 residential units ranging in size from 600 to 750 square feet. The architects were Trost & Trost of El Paso, with George P. Hill. The Castle Apartments were added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1985 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History The apartments were built in 1922 by Arno Huning, the son of well known local businessman Franz Huning. At the time, the city was growing rapidly and there was an increasing demand for new apartment housing. Huning built the apartments on a piece of his late father's estate near the Huning Castle mansion, for which the building was named. The apartments cost approximately $75,000, a significant amount for the time. with Contemporary advertisements reported that the apartments would \\"help to fill a long felt need in this city in providing homes for those of the most exacting requirements. The architect, while not restricted as to cost, has not permitted fancy to wander at random but has kept his product within the bounds of refined elegance.\\" Due to the building's high quality of construction, it remained a fashionable address through much of its history. Architecture The Castle Apartments were designed by the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost with George P. Hill. It was a U-shaped, two-story building with a central courtyard opening onto Central Avenue. The front elevation was symmetrical with two projecting entrance bays on each of the side wings and one in the center, all topped with triangular pediments. Other ornamentation was restrained, consisting of simple stringcourse and cornice moldings and a subtly crenellated parapet. The exterior walls were finished with cream-colored stucco and contained over 100 original wood-framed sash windows. The apartments consisted of 20 one- and two-bedroom units ranging in size from 600 to 750 square feet (56‚Äì70 m2). Each unit had ceilings, hardwood floors, and central steam heating provided by a boiler in the southwest corner of the building. The second-floor units were accessed by interior staircases, while the first-floor units could be entered directly from the courtyard as well as from the interior landings. At the time of the building's destruction, the interior trim and hardware was largely original. Also on the property was an original 10-unit garage building. The fire-damaged building in 2010, shortly before its demolition Fire and aftermath The Castle Apartments fire began around 8 pm on August 4, 2009, and quickly spread throughout the entire building via the shared attic space. Thirteen fire trucks and around 50 firefighters responded to the scene, fighting the blaze for nearly a full day before it was extinguished. No one was injured in the fire, but the historic apartments were gutted. The building's owners initially expressed optimism that it could be restored, but were unable to find a financially viable means of doing so. Eventually, the burned-out structure was demolished in July 2010. The site was redeveloped and is now occupied by a bank building. Televised footage of the fire was used by AMC's Albuquerque-based television series Breaking Bad to represent the crash of airliner Wayfarer 515 (season 3, episode 1, \\"No M√°s\\").

The conflict was an early example of unconventional warfare.  Background  After the capture of Algiers by France and the defeat of Ottoman troops, France invaded the rest of the country. The end of military resistance to the French presence did not mean that the region was totally conquered. France faced several tribal rebellions, massacres of settlers and razzias in French Algeria. To eliminate them, many campaigns and colonisation operations were conducted over nearly 70 years, from 1835 to 1903.  Campaigns = First Campaign against Abd-el- Kader (1835-1837)  Tribal elders in the territories near Mascara chose the 25-five-year-old \`Abd al-QƒÅdir (Abd-el-Kader), to lead the jihad against the French. Recognised as Amir al-Muminin (commander of the faithful), he quickly gained the support of tribes in the western territories. In 1834, he concluded a treaty with General Desmichels, who was then military commander of the province of Oran. The treaty was reluctantly accepted by the French administration and made France recognise Abd al-QƒÅdir as the sovereign of the territory in Oran Province not under French control, and it authorized him to send consuls to French-held cities. The treaty did not require Abd al-QƒÅdir to recognize French rule, something glossed over in its French text. He used the peace provided by the treaty to widen his influence with tribes throughout western and central Algeria. D'Erlon was apparently unaware of the danger posed by Abd al-QƒÅdir's activities, but General Camille Alphonse Tr√©zel, then in command at Oran, saw it and attempted to separate some of the tribes from Abd al-QƒÅdir. When he succeeded in convincing two tribes near Oran to acknowledge French supremacy, Abd al-QƒÅdir dispatched troops to move those tribes to the interior, away from French influence. Tr√©zel countered by marching a column of troops out from Oran to protect those tribes' territory on 16 June 1835. After exchanging threats, Abd al-QƒÅdir withdrew his consul from Oran and ejected the French consul from Mascara, a de facto declaration of war. The two forces clashed in a bloody but inconclusive engagement near the Sig River. However, when the French, who were short on provisions, began withdrawing toward Arzew, And al-QƒÅdir led 20,000 men against the beleaguered column and, in the Battle of Macta routed the force, killing 500 men. The debacle led to the recall of d'Erlon. General Clausel was appointed a second time to replace d'Erlon and led an attack against Mascara in December of that year, which Abd al-QƒÅdir, with advance warning, had evacuated. In January 1836, he occupied Tlemcen and established a garrison there before he returned to Algiers to plan an attack against Constantine. Abd al-QƒÅdir continued to harry the French at Tlemcen and so additional troops, under Thomas Robert Bugeaud, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars experienced in irregular warfare, were sent from Oran to secure control up to the Tafna River and to resupply the garrison. Abd al-QƒÅdir retreated before Bugeaud but decided to make a stand on the banks of the Sikkak River. On July 6, 1836, Bugeaud decisively defeated al-QƒÅdir in the Battle of Sikkak, losing fewer than 50 men to more than 1,000 casualties suffered by Abd al-QƒÅdir. The battle was one of the few formal battles that al-QƒÅdir engaged in; after the loss, he restricted his actions as much as possible to guerilla-style attacks. In May 1837, General Thomas Robert Bugeaud, then in command of Oran, negotiated the Treaty of Tafna with al-QƒÅdir that effectively recognised al-QƒÅdir's control over much of the interior of what is now Algeria.  Second Campaign against Abd-el-Kader (1839-1847)  Al-QƒÅdir used the Treaty of Tafna to consolidate his power over tribes throughout the interior by establishing new cities far from French control. He worked to motivate the population under French control to resist by peaceful and military means. Seeking to face the French again, he laid claim under the treaty to territory that included the main route between Algiers and Constantine. When French troops contested that claim in late 1839 by marching through a mountain defile known as the Iron Gates, al-QƒÅdir claimed a breach of the treaty and renewed calls for jihad. Throughout 1840, he waged guerilla war against the French in the provinces of Algiers and Oran, which Val√©e's failures to deal with adequately led to his replacement in December 1840 by General Bugeaud. Bugeaud instituted a strategy of scorched earth, combined with fast-moving cavalry columns like those used by al-QƒÅdir to take territory from him gradually. The troops' tactics were heavy-handed, and the population suffered significantly. Al-QƒÅdir was eventually forced to establish a mobile headquarters, which was known as a smala or zmelah. In 1843, French forces successfully raided his camp while he was away from it and captured more than 5,000 fighters and al-QƒÅdir's warchest. Al-QƒÅdir was forced to retreat into Morocco from which he had been receiving some support, especially from tribes in the border areas. When French diplomatic efforts to convince Morocco to expel al-QƒÅdir failed, the French resorted to military means with the First Franco-Moroccan War in 1844 to compel the sultan to change his policy. Eventually hemmed between French and Moroccan troops on the border in December 1847, al-QƒÅdir chose to surrender to the French under terms that would allow him to go into exile in the Middle East. The French violated the terms by holding him in France until 1852, when he was allowed to go to Damascus.  Campaign of Kabylie (1857)  Campaign against El-Mokrani (1871)  Conquest of the Sahara (1881-1902)  South-Oranese Campaign (1897-1903)  The Maghreb in the second half of the 19th century In the 1890s, the French administration and military called for the annexation of the Touat, the Gourara and the Tidikelt,Frank E.

Boston University African Studies Center: ¬´ The Algerian-Moroccan conflict can be said to have begun in the 1890s when the administration and military in Algeria called for annexation of the Touat- Gourara-Tidikelt, a sizable expanse of Saharan oases that was nominally a part of the Moroccan Empire (...)

The loose boundary, between French Algeria and the Sultanate of Morocco, promotes incursions and attacks perpetrated by Moroccan tribesmen. On 17 August 1903, the first battle of the South-Oranese campaign took place in Taghit in which French Foreign legionnaires were assailed by a contingent of more than 1,000 well-equipped Berbers. For 3 days, the legionnaires repelled repeated attacks of an enemy more than 10 times higher in number and inflicted huge losses on the attackers, forcing them finally into a hasty retreat. A few days after the Battle of Taghit, 148 legionnaires of the 22nd mounted company, from the 2e REI, commanded by Captain Vauchez and Lieutenant Selchauhansen, 20 Spahis and 2 Mokhaznis, forming part of escorting a supply convoy, were ambushed, on September 2, by 3,000 Moroccans tribesmen, at El-Moungar. Atrocities During their pacification of Algeria, French forces engaged in a scorched earth policy against the Algerian population. Returning from an investigation trip to Algeria, Tocqueville wrote that \\"we make war much more barbaric than the Arabs themselves [...] it is for their part that civilization is situated.\\"Alexis de Tocqueville, De colony in Algeria. 1847, Complexe Editions, 1988. Colonel Montagnac stated that the purpose of the pacification was to \\"destroy everything that crawl at our feet like dogs\\"Quoted in Marc Ferro, \\"The conquest of Algeria\\", in The black book of colonialism , Robert Laffont, p. 657 . The scorched earth policy, decided by Governor General Bugeaudhas, had devastating effects on the socio-economic and food balances of the country: \\"we fire little gunshot, we burn all douars, all villages, all huts; the enemy flees across taking his flock.\\" According to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison, the colonisation of Algeria lead to the extermination of a third of the population from multiple causes (massacres, deportations, famines or epidemics) that were all interrelated.Colonize Exterminate. On War and the Colonial State, Paris, Fayard, 2005. See also the book by the American historian Benjamin Claude Brower, A Desert named Peace. The Violence of France's Empire in the Algerian Sahara, 1844-1902, New York, Columbia University Press. French forces deported and banished entire Algerian tribes. The great Moorish families (of Spanish origin) of Tlemcen were exiled to the Orient (Levant), and others were emigrated elsewhere. The tribes that were considered too troublesome were banned, and some took refuge in Tunisia, Morocco and even Syria. Other tribes were deported to New Caledonia or Guyana. Also, French forces also engaged in wholesale massacres of entire tribes. All 500 men, women and children of the El Oufia tribe were killed in one night.Blood and Soil: Ben Kiernan, page 365, 2008 All 500 to 700 members of the Ouled Rhia tribe were killed by suffocation in a cave. During the Siege of Laghouat, the French army engaged in one of the first instances of recorded use of chemical weapon on civilians and other atrocities causing Algerians to refer to the period as the year of the \\"Khalya\\", Arabic for emptiness, which is commonly known to the inhabitants of Laghouat as the year that the city was emptied of its population. It is also commonly known as the year of Hessian sacks, referring to the way the captured surviving men and boys were put alive in the hessian sacks and thrown into dug-up trenches.  Characterisation as genocide  Some governments and scholars have called France's conquest of Algeria a genocide, such as Ben Kiernan, an Australian expert on the Cambodian genocide,http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/disowning-morris wrote in Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur on the French conquest of Algeria: > By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately > 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830. A long shadow of genocidal hatred > persisted, provoking a French author to protest in 1882 that in Algeria, \\"we > hear it repeated every day that we must expel the native and if necessary > destroy him.\\" As a French statistical journal urged five years late, \\"the > system of extermination must give way to a policy of penetration.\\" > -Ben Kiernan, Blood and Soil'' '' In 2011, in response to France's recognition of the Armenian Genocide, Turkey accused France of committing genocide against 15% of Algeria's population.

As a painter from Livorno, he might have belonged to the group of the Postmacchiaioli, together with Mario Puccini, Oscar Ghiglia, Plinio Nomellini, Ulvi Liegi, Giovanni Bartolena, and others, but he is a disciple of the Florentine portraitist Michele Gordigiani.

On Paper, Complete Catalogue of the graphic work of Alfredo M√ºller (1869-1939) in three languages, H√©l√®ne Koehl ed., published in 2014 M√ºller was born in Livorno to a wealthy Swiss family involved in the international cotton and coffee trades. At the age of 15, he began studying art in Florence with the masters Giuseppe Ciaranfi and Michele Gordigiani of the Academy of Fine Arts. There he became friends for life with Edoardo Gordigiani, the son of Michele, and Egisto Fabbri, a Tuscan-American. In 1886, as a young painter, he participated in the First Exhibition of Fine Arts of Livorno, together with established painters such as Giovanni Fattori and Silvestro Lega. In 1889, he exhibited two of his paintings at the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he discovered Impressionism. This moment represented a turning point in the career of the young painter, as he was always concerned with colors and vibrations of light. After his return to Tuscany, his paintings, which now reflected the influence of Impressionism, sparked debate for their overly French character. At the same moment, the failure of the Bank of Livorno provoked the ruin of his father's house, and a few years later M√ºller emigrated to Paris, eventually settling in Montmartre. He made friends in the social circle of artists, writers and musicians, becoming acquainted in particular with Renoir, but also with Pissarro and C√©zanne, whom he considered his master, and became a well-known etcher in colours. Among his Italian friends in Paris, we find his relative Leonetto Cappiello and Libero Andreotti. In 1914, he was in Rome with Marguerite, whom he married in 1908. In Rome he exhibited 12 paintings at the Second Secession. Because of the war, he moved to Florence initially for a short while but he ended up staying for 18 years. The couple found a little house in the hills overlooking Florence, at Settignano. M√ºller painted frequently, always working on the movement of light. A great part of his work in this period was dedicated to decorative arts, in which he could express his fascination for theater and its magic. After the political situation worsened, he returned to France in 1932 where he spent his last years. He died in Paris in 1939. He is the elder brother of the cycling champion Rodolfo M√ºller, who ran the first Tour de France (arrived 4th) and the brother in law of the American cycling-champion and pace-maker Gus Lawson who married his younger sister Marie. He descends from Lewis Evans (surveyor), geographer and close friend of Benjamin Franklin, whose daughter Amelia (Philadelphia 1744- Hythe (Southampton, 1835), married to the Irish sea Captain David Barry, was the great grandmother of Alfredo's grandfather Charles Eug√®ne Schintz, surgeon in Livorno.

Hannemann and Gabbard also differed on the issue of same-sex marriage. Gabbard was opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act and to a proposed Hawaii state constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a woman and a man, while Hannemann supported DOMA. Gabbard had previously opposed same-sex marriage, but during the primary campaign, promised to work to repeal DOMA and co-sponsor the Respect for Marriage act. Voters initially doubted the sincerity of her new views on the issue. Gabbard filed a 270-page complaint against Hannemann's spending, saying that his campaign broke campaign finance laws by failing to report 2012 travel and polling expenses and improperly dealt with Hanneman's salary from a tourism association. Candidates Marx, Gabbard, and Kia'aina debated on June 5, and Marx, Gabbard, Kia'aina and Hannemann debated in early July. Gabbard's ratings in the polls increased steadily and Hannemann's dropped throughout the primary campaign,; as of August 6, she was leading against Hanneman 49% to 29%. On August 11, she defeated Hanneman by twenty points, winning the primary. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser described her win as the \\"improbable rise from a distant underdog to victory\\".

The plan also included him staying at a nearby inn while under the doctor's care. Van Gogh had a room at the nearby Auberge Ravoux. Van Gogh developed a close relationship with the doctor who he described as \\"something like another brother.\\" From the first meeting, though, Van Gogh sensed that Dr. Gachet may have been as ill as he. In a letter from May 20, 1890, Van Gogh wrote, \\"I have seen Dr. Gachet, who made the impression on me of being rather eccentric, but his experience as a doctor must keep him balanced while fighting the nervous trouble from which he certainly seems to me to be suffering at least as seriously as I.\\" Gardens Van Gogh derived enjoyment from gardens; from his father's garden in the Netherlands, the garden he created at his London rental property when he was an art dealer there, to the many paintings that he made of flowers and other gardens. When he integrated Impressionism into his work, his interest in gardens are depicted in the gardens of the Arles hospital, Saint-R√©my asylum and the gardens of Charles Daubigny and Dr. Paul Gachet in Auvers. Van Gogh wrote many letters to his brother Theo and Willemina about gardening ideas, color harmonies and the benefits of working in a garden. Known for his works of sunflowers, he also made paintings with red poppies, grasses, irises and other garden plants. The colors used in the paintings may have been suggestive of his mood. When depressed, he painted \\"ghostly white-hooded arums.\\" When he was in good mood he used bright colors, such as vibrant pink oleanders. During times of inner turmoil, ‚Äúdark green spire like cypresses writhing with energy and contorted olive trees vibrant with silvery leaves. To his sister, Wil, Van Gogh advised her to cultivate her own garden, like Voltaire's Candide, to find joy and meaning in life. Paintings Sue Roe, author of The Private Lives of the Impressionists, wrote of Dr. Gachet's garden: > \\"Dr. Gachet's house was set in the hillside above the main street [of the > village], with a terraced garden full of flowers and looking down into the > valley of the Oise. The house and garden were always full of stray cats, > chickens and a ragged, featherless rooster... In the garden, he [Dr. Gachet] > worked at a table painted bright orange (later immortalized by Van Gogh, in > his Portrait of Dr Gachet).\\" \\"Maison du Dr. Gachet,\\" the house and gardens of Dr. Paul Gachet, was opened to the public in 2004. Doctor Gachet's Garden in Auvers Van Gogh became friends with Gachet very quickly after arriving at Auvers. He was invited to visit his home as he wanted. Van Gogh hoped to paint Gachet's garden, possibly one or two days a week. Marguerite Gachet in the Garden In late June Van Gogh wrote of his interest to paint Marguerite Gachet, maybe in a country girl pose. A few days later he wrote that he painted her in a pink dress playing a piano, and the previous day she had posed for this garden painting. In Marguerite Gachet in the Garden, Marguerite is dressed in white, \\"like a bride.\\" The garden of white roses and light lemon marigolds. It was rumored in Auvers that Van Gogh considered Marguerite a friend and that she desired a relationship with him. Dr. Gachet, though, had not given permission for the sittings and when he learned of the two sittings in two consecutive nights he was quite apprehensive about any relationship they might share. Dr. Gachet asked Van Gogh to end his relationship with Marguerite.Fell, Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness, p. 108 Derek Fell, author of Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness, suggests that Van Gogh may have cared more deeply than imagined and been at least in part the reason for shooting himself. In a letter to Theo Van Gogh expressed his sadness and frustration of not having a long-term partnership, \\"That desire [for marriage] has left me, though the mental suffering of it remains.\\"Fell, Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness, p. 234 There were other concerns as well that affected Van Gogh at that time: the illness of Theo's baby, Theo's health and employment issues, potential loss of Theo's support and the destruction of his relationship with Dr. Gachet who was meant to manage Van Gogh's health and be a stabilizing influence. Provenance Both 'garden paintings' were part of the collection of Dr. Gachet until 1954 when they were given to the state and allotted to the Louvre museum, gallery of Jeu de Paume. The paintings resided there at the gallery of Jeu de Paume, or Mus√©e de l'Impressionisme from 1954 to 1986. In 1986 the museum closed due to cramped conditions and its collections were transferred to the new Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay. Since 1986 the paintings have been at the Mus√©e d'Orsay. Other paintings of the Gachets Gachet and his daughter were both subjects for Van Gogh's paintings.

He began to paint at such a steady pace, there was barely space in his room for all the finished paintings. From May until his death on July 29, Van Gogh made about 70 paintings, more than one a day, and many drawings. Van Gogh painted buildings around the town of Auvers, such as The Church at Auvers, portraits, and the nearby fields. From Wallace, \\"But for all his appearance of a renewed well- being his life was very near its end.\\" Illness struck Theo's baby, Vincent. Theo had both health and employment issues; he considered leaving his employer and starting his own business. Gachet, said to have his own eccentricities and neurosis, caused Van Gogh concern to which he questioned: \\"Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both end up in the ditch?\\" After visiting Paris for a family conference, Van Gogh returned to Auvers more bleak. In a letter he wrote, \\"And the prospect grows darker, I see no future at all.\\" ReferencesExternal links * La maison du docteur Gachet a Auvers-sur-Oise (french) * House and Garden of Dr. Gachet, Fodor's review Category:1890 paintings Category:Paintings by Vincent van Gogh category:Paintings of the Mus√©e d'Orsay Category:Flower paintings ","title":"Doctor Gachet's Garden in Auvers"},{"id":"31584016","title":"1960 South Korean legislative election"},{"id":"31584021","text":"Kazem Hasan (born 9 February 1961) is a Kuwaiti fencer.

Cerambus was renowned as the greatest singer of his time. He was credited with inventing the shepherd's pipes, as well as with introducing lyre-playing and composing a number of delightful songs. This was why the nymphs of Mount Othrys favored him, and even became visible to him as he was playing his lyre. The honors, however, made Cerambus arrogant to the point of insanity: when Pan advised him to drive his cattle down to the plain, due to an extremely severe winter being expected, Cerambus wouldn't listen to him. Moreover, he told insulting tales of the nymphs, claiming that they were descended not from Zeus, but from Spercheus and Deino, and that when Poseidon fell for one of the nymphs, Diopatra, he changed her sisters into poplar trees, but restored their original shape after satisfying his desires.

Formation The La Conner Trading and Transportation Company was formed in the early 1890s by four officers of the steamer Henry Bailey, Joshua Green, purser, Sam Denny, master, Peter Falk, mate, and Frank Zickmund, second engineer. Green persuaded the others to leave the Henry Bailey and go into business for themselves, by purchasing the freight steamer Fannie Lake and a scow, for a total investment of about $5000. Green at the time had savings of only about $250 and the others had very little. However they were able to secure loans of $1,250 each, secured by the steamer and the scow, from banker Jacob Furth and the Puget Sound National Bank.Klein and Bayless, Ferry Boats, at 36, 39-41. Operations Running in the freight business, the company was not competing for passenger fares. Instead the new firm's main competition came from George T. Willey, a Seattle hay and grain merchant. As business increased, the four partners bought another steamer, the Annie M. Pence. Willey then joined with the four original partners and they incorporated the business as the La Conner Trading and Transportation Company. The company suffered business reverses. In April 1893, Fannie Lake was destroyed by a fire that started in a cargo of hay. The vessel was valued at $5,000 and insured for only $4,000.Wright, E.W., Lewis & Dryden's Marine history of the Pacific Northwest, Lewis & Dryden Printing Co., Portland, OR (1995), at page 411. An economic depression called the Panic of 1893 hit the company hard, and things got worse when the company's other hay steamer, the uninsurable Anna M. Pence, was also destroyed by fire. Green had the idea to purchase a new boat, which he would name after the builder, which he concluded would save up to $2,000 off the price of the boat. Builders were willing to build for less if the completed vessel were to be named after the builder, as it would function as a floating advertisement. In this way, the company acquired the T.W. Lake built by the shipbuilder of the same name. The Lake was purpose-built to move freight, and included a winch to lift cargo up to piers, regardless of the state of the tide. Expansion of business Following the purchase of the Lake, the company continued to expand, adding the steamers E.D. Smith, Utopia, George E. Starr, and the sternwheelers State of Washington, Fairhaven and La Conner to the roster. The company also built the City of Denver for Colorado investors. When the Colorado interests defaulted on payment, the company took over the boat and added to their fleet. The company had also expanded into the passenger business, buying the fast steamer Inland Flyer and putting that vessel on the lucrative Seattle ‚Äì Bremerton run in opposition to the Athlon, owned by H.B. Kennedy. Corporate changes By 1902, Joshua Green had bought out Sam Denny's shares, and some of the stock of George T. Willey. Willey then sold the rest of his shares to the Alaska Steamship Company, of which Charles E. Peabody was president. This gave Peabody and Alaska Steam a controlling interest in La Conner Trading. Alaska Steam ran ships to Alaska and also had a large fleet of inland vessels operating on Puget Sound. The Puget Sound operations were conducted under the name of the Puget Sound Navigation Company. With the acquisition of La Conner Trading, PSN was almost doubled in the size of its fleet. After a period of transition, the La Conner company was effectively merged into the reorganized Puget Sound Navigation Company, which in later years came to dominate Puget Sound passenger and ferry business as a near-monopoly.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Early history A Norman church stood on the site of the present church by about 1100. This was probably destroyed in 1216 when Sandwich was attacked by the French. The church was rebuilt during the 13th century, it is thought, by Carmelite friars from France. At this time the church consisted of a nave with north and south aisles, a tower and a chancel. Beneath the chancel was a vaulted undercroft, which was probably used as a charnel house. During the 14th century the north aisle was widened and raised in height, and a chantry chapel was built at the east end of the south aisle. The north porch was added in the following century. In 1560 a group of Flemish Protestants from the Spanish Netherlands came to live in Sandwich, and St Peter's became their church. The tower collapsed in 1661, destroying the south aisle. The Flemings rebuilt the tower, but left the south aisle ruined, and filled in the south arcade, making it the exterior south wall. They also added a cupola to the top of the tower. The church was restored during the 19th century. In the 1860s the west end was restored after it had been damaged in a storm, the roofs were retiled, the choir stalls were re-arranged, the box pews were replaced by bench seating, and the pulpit was moved from its position against the north wall to the southeast corner of the nave. It is thought that some of this might have been directed by the architect William White. Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed in a mixture of materials, including pebbles, stone rubble, and brick. The roof are tiled. Its plan consists of a nave, a central tower, a chancel, and a north aisle which stretches for almost the whole length of the church. At the southeast of the church is a two-storey vestry. There is a ruined vestry at the east end of the aisle. The tower is in three stages. The upper two stages, built after the collapse of 1661, contain round-headed windows and bell openings, and clock faces. The parapet is embattled, and on top of the tower is a square domed cupola. On the south side of the bottom stage of the tower is a 17th-century window. Below this is the blocked south tower arch containing a blocked 17th-century window. On the south side of the nave and chancel are more blocked arches. Above the blocked arches in the nave is the 13th-century clerestory the contain paired lights. Protruding from the chancel is the south vestry, with a curved Dutch gable dating from the middle of the 16th century. This contains square 16th-century windows. The undercroft under the vestry, which is only partly below ground, is lit by two 13th-century openings. The east window dates from the 14th century, and is Decorated in style. There are further Decorated windows in the north aisle, and other windows dating from the 17th or 18th centuries. The north porch has an embattled parapet, and dates from the 15th century. This leads to a 14th-century door. The west door dates from the 19th century, and is in Decorated style. Interior The interior of St Peter's Church Between the nave and the north aisle is a three-bay arcade, and between the chancel and the aisle is a two-bay arcade; both are carried on polygonal piers. In the chancel is a three-seat sedilia, which dates from the 13th century, and a piscina. There is a blocked squint in the sedilia, and another in the north chapel. Also present in the church are the royal arms of Charles II. In the north aisle are a number of late 14th-century tomb recesses. The organ is small, having a single manual, four stops, and 173 pipes. It incorporates pipes taken from an earlier organ that was built in about 1880 by Charles H. Hobday, and was installed in the north aisle in 1895. It has since been rebuilt and now stands in the nave. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1779 by William Mears. They are unringable because the tower is unsafe, having last been rung (except for the curfew bell) in 1913. Recent history and present day In 1948 the parish of St Peter's was united with those of St Mary's and St Clement's. St Clement's became the parish church of Sandwich, and St Peter's was closed for regular worship. From 1952 it was used by Sir Roger Manwood's School as their chapel. On 22 February 1973 the church was declared redundant and it was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 16 April 1974. In the 1990s a garden was developed in what had been the ruins of the south aisle. The garden contains a two-light 14th-century window which was removed from the former St Thomas' Hospital, and erected on this site in 1923. In 2006 the Trust started a seven-year project to repair and redecorate the church. The care of the church is supported by a group known as the Friends of St Peter's. A programme of community events and occasional services is held in the church. At the west end of the church is a display relating to the Earls of Sandwich. The ancient custom of ringing the curfew bell from the church at 8pm daily still continues. The church is open daily for visitors.

Biography Schulz was born into a wealthy family, and although of the Jewish faith, religion played no role in the family. His father was a lawyer and a college friend of the writer Friedrich Adler. Lucia, one of his sisters, was the first wife of the painter L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. As a high school student Schultz studied the works of Max Brod, Egon Erwin Kisch, Franz Kafka, Paul Leppin, and Franz Werfel. Schulz graduated in 1915 from the Charles University in Prague and entered the army shortly thereafter. After release from service, he went to Berlin where he worked from 1918 to 1920 as a journalist, until writing for film. His early screenplays were for crime and drama films, before he turned his attention to comedy. His first \\"talkie\\" was the 1930 film Die Drei von der Tankstelle, followed in 1931 by feature film screenplays for Die Privatsekret√§rin and Bombs on Monte Carlo. In 1933 Schulz emigrated to Prague. Forced out of the Germany film industry by the rise of The Third Reich, Schultz emigrated to England. In 1939, Schulz co-founded the 'Austrian Exile Theatre Laterndl' that attempted to preserve Viennese culture through performances of cabaret and stage plays until August 1945. The Laterndl became one of the \\"outstanding cultural achievements of German- speaking exile in London\\". In 1938-39 he worked with Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett to create the Mitchell Leisen comedy film Midnight. From 1940 on, and later as a naturalized US citizen, Shultz was officially Francis George Spencer. Upon the end of World War II emigrated to the United States where he continued work in film (and later television) as a screenwriter. Schulz later settled in Ascona, Switzerland and worked primarily as a playwright. His last feature film was the 1956 ', for which he adapted the 1898 Gerhart Hauptmann stage play of the same name for director Josef von B√°ky. On 4 May 1971, six weeks after his 74th birthday, Shchulz died at Muralto, Tessin, Switzerland. He is interred at the Pambio-Naranco Jewish cemetery in Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland.

He venerated Apollo and Artemis diligently and was in return favored by the two gods so much that Apollo once took him to the land of the Hyperboreans, where he visited the shrine of the Hyperborean Apollo. Upon return home, Clinis decided that from now on, he should honor Apollo by sacrificing donkeys to him, just like the Hyperboreans did. But when everything was ready for the sacrifice, Apollo warned Clinis against doing so because donkeys offered by non-Hyperboreans were not the right kind of sacrifice for the god. Then a heated argument arose between the children of Clinis whether to continue with the sacrificial rite or not: Lycius and Harpasus insisted on sacrificing the donkeys nevertheless, while Ortygius and Artemiche maintained that the god's word should be obeyed. Finally, Lycius and Harpasus drove the donkeys to the altar; at the moment, Apollo struck the animals with madness, which caused them to attack and devour Clinis and his family. Poseidon took pity of Harpe and Harpasus and transformed them into birds of the same names; Leto and Artemis implored Apollo to save Clinis, Ortygius and Artemiche, who were not guilty of the impious act, which the god did, changing the rest of the family into birds as well: Clinis into a hypaietos (\\"under-eagle\\"), Lycius into a white raven (which became black after the incident with Coronis), Artemiche into a lark, and Ortygius into a tit (Greek aigithos), because he had suggested that his father sacrificed goats (Greek aiges) instead of donkeys.

Her greatest successes were at Vienna. Bertha Schwarz was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on 27 January 1855, the daughter of actors who worked at nearby Mannheim. As an opera singer, she was for many years a prominent member of the company of the Vienna Court Opera, where her fame was such that an asteroid discovered on 4 September 1880 was named 218 Bianca in her honour. Two years later Johann Strauss II was inspired by her to compose his Fr√ºhlingsstimmen waltz for orchestra and solo soprano voice, still familiar today.

A geometric network is similar to a graph in mathematics and computer science, and can be described and analyzed using theories and concepts similar to graph theory. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks (such as electric, gas, and water utilities). Composition of a Geometric Network A geometric network is composed of edges that are connected. Connectivity rules for the network specify which edges are connected and at what points they are connected, commonly referred to as junction or intersection points. These edges can have weights or flow direction assigned to them, which dictate certain properties of these edges that affect analysis results . In the case of certain types of networks, source points (points where flow originates) and sink points (points where flow terminates) may also exist. In the case of utility networks, a source point may correlate with an electric substation or a water pumping station, and a sink point may correlate with a service connection at a residential household. Functions Networks define the interconnectedness of features. Through analyzing this connectivity, paths from one point to another on the network can be traced and calculated. Through optimization algorithms and utilizing network weights and flow, these paths can also be optimized to show specialized paths, such as the shortest path between two points on the network, as is commonly done in the calculation of driving directions. Networks can also be used to perform spatial analysis to determine points or edges that are encompassed in a certain area or within a certain distance of a specified point. This has applications in hydrology and urban planning, among other fields. Applications * Routing: for calculating driving directions, paths from one point of interest to another, locating nearby points of interest * Urban Planning: for site suitability studies, and traffic and congestion studies. * Electric Utility Industry: for modeling an electrical grid in GIS, tracing from a generation source * Other Public Utilities: for modeling water distribution flow and natural gas distribution See also * Graphs * Graph theory * Geographic Information Systems References Category:Geographic information systems ","title":"Geometric networks"},{"id":"31584314","title":"1981 South Korean legislative election"},{"id":"31584333","text":"The Cottaer Spitzberg is a 390.8 m high basalt dome on the western edge of Saxon Switzerland. Since 1979 the hill has been a protected area due to its geological and botanical features.  Location and area  Cotta and the Cottaer Spitzberg on an 1812 map of Oberreitschen The hill, which was once also known Cottaer Spitze, is located on the plateau between the valleys of the Gottleuba to the east and the Bahre to the west. It rises above the village of Cotta at its northern foot as well as the local area by at least 70 metres and forms a clear landmark in the countryside.  Geology  The Cottaer Spitzberg was formed as a result of the Tertiary breakthrough of basalt through the Cretaceous sandstone sediments of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. In geological region that is composed largely of sandstone, granite and gneiss the hill is very much a geological exception. Basalt cone at the summit The hill is one of a line of volcanic inselbergs of which the Stolpener Burgberg, the Wilisch and the Geising are the best-known. On the rocky summit of the Spitzberg, the grey and black columns of the trachyte basalt are exposed. They are each around 30 centimetres thick, rising almost vertically and were intensively quarried in the 19th century by a quarry company. Only a remnant of the summit remains, because a triangulation column of the central European meridian arc and Saxon State Survey Office had been erected on it in 1865.  Botanical features  The Cottaer Spitzberg is also a significant area for botany, although the quarry has reduced the variety of local plants. Species like the Sword-leaved Helleborine, the Large Pink or the Bristly Bellflower are amongst the species that used to grow here but no longer occur. In spite of that the Spitzberg continues to be a botanically interesting habitat. On the northern side there is an oak and hornbeam wood (including Small-leaved Lime, Norway Maple, Sycamore Maple and Ash) interspersed with species like the lungworts. In addition the sun-exposed hill is also home to several warmth-loving plants like the Crown Vetch and the Hoary Cinquefoil.  History  At the beginning of the 1960s in the heyday of the Cold War a small bunker system was built on the eastern side of the hill. This was intended to be the emergency command post for the district of Pirna in the event of a nuclear attack on Dresden. On the western side facing Dresden an observation post was erected.  Views  The Cottaer Spitzberg has long been a popular destination because, on the top of the treeless basalt summit, there is a panoramic all-round view, only restricted closer in. In clear conditions the views extend as far as: * North: over Pirna to the Lusatian Highlands, * Northwest: over the Dresden Basin, * West and south: over the Elbe Valley Slate Mountains to the crest of the Eastern Ore Mountains, * East: over the Gottleuba valley to the table mountains of Saxon Switzerland and the volcanic cone of the Central Bohemian Uplands.

After military service he attended Ruskin College, Oxford where he pursued a degree in history. A chance meeting with Newfoundland lexicographer George M. Story resulted in Matthews being offered a fellowship if he would write on the history of the West of England Newfoundland fishery. His Dphil thesis was an important work, becoming a standard work on the history of the migratory fishery. Matthews took up work at Memorial University of Newfoundland, where he taught the history of Newfoundland and Labrador. His critique of the traditional historiography argued that previous historians had been mistaken in their assumption that conflict between competing groups had shaped the settlement and constitutional development of the island of Newfoundland. Different historians had believed that the conflict was between merchants in the west of England and settlers in Newfoundland, or between West Country merchants and London based merchants. Matthews found little evidence of such conflict and argued that settlement was not inconsistent with the migratory fishery. He argued that the laws prohibiting settlement were short-lived and ineffectual. The slow pace of settlement was, therefore, a result of other factors.Jeff A Webb \\"Historical Fence Building Revisited: Keith Matthews and the Historiography of Newfoundland\\" Canadian Historical Review (June 2010) 91:2, 315-38. In 1966, the British Public Record Office decided to dispose of the \\"Registrar General of Shipping and Seaman, the Agreements and Account of Crew and Official Logbooks\\" of the British Empire for the years between 1861 and 1913. When Matthews became aware of that he arranged for the bulk of the records to be transferred to the Maritime History Archive at Memorial University. With his colleague David Alexander, Matthews embarked upon a study of the shipping industry of Atlantic Canada. Matthews amassed a substantial collection of English, Irish and Newfoundland records to develop a database of family names and businesses that were involved in the settlement, fisheries and trade of Newfoundland to 1850. The files consist of parish registers, newspapers, shipping records, customs records, political papers, census records, merchant records, and diaries, from which he extracted 7,300 surnames, subdivided by given name. The Keith Matthews Name Files, 1500-1850, are housed in the Maritime History Archive, Memorial University.

The conflict had two phases between 1899 and 1903 and ended with an Acrean victory and the subsequent Treaty of Petr√≥polis, which ceded Acre to Brazil. The outcome also affected territories disputed with Peru.  Causes  The region of Acre possessed rich gold deposits and an abundance of timber, principally rubber trees. From the end of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century, rubber trees were crucial to the automobile and transport industry, as synthetic rubber for the manufacture of tires and other objects was not discovered until around World War II. It is because of this that the war is also referred to as the Rubber War (Guerra del Caucho), as one of the motives that drove Jefferson Jos√© Torres, Governor of Amazonas (Brazilian state), was a rubber export tax.  Antecedents  Map showing the Bolivian territory in 1899, before Acrean Revolution. The border between Brazil and Bolivia was delimited by the Treaty of Ayacucho. The province of Acre, a territory of about five times the size of Belgium, belonged to Bolivia. Embedded in the heart of South America, Acre aroused little interest for its inaccessibility and apparent lack of commercial value. Its population was composed of a small number of Indians without national identity and a handful of Brazilians and Bolivians. When the price of rubber rose significantly in the late 19th century, about 18,000 adventurers and settlers, most from Brazil, went to Acre to exploit the rubber trees. There were practically no roads so that the main means of transport were some river steamers, canoes and rafts.  First \\"Republic of Acre\\"  Seal of the former Republic of Acre. On January 2, 1899, Bolivia set up a customs office in Puerto Alonso (today Porto Acre), which upset the Brazilian settlers, who wanted to oust the Bolivian authorities. A lawyer, Dr. Jos√© de Carvalho, led a revolt against the Bolivians on April 30. Colonel Ismael Montes, Bolivia's Minister of War and commander of the 1st Expedition to Acre. Pressured by Jos√© de Carvalho, Bolivians were forced to leave the region. To prevent their return the governor of Amazonas, Jos√© Cardoso Ramalho Junior, organized a team to enter Acre; commanded by Spaniard Luis G√°lvez Rodr√≠guez de Arias, who served as a Bolivian consul in Bel√©m. G√°lvez left Manaus on June 4, 1899, and came to the Bolivian town of Puerto Alonso, which had its name changed to Porto Acre, where he proclaimed the Republic of Acre on July 14, 1899, discreetly supported by willing amazonense officialdom, imposing his authority on the lands that the Treaty of Ayacucho (1867) had entrusted to Bolivia. Bolivia responded by sending a force of 500 men. Before his arrival, Galvez was taken prisoner by Antonio de Sousa Braga, who declared himself president of Acre. Shortly afterwards, however, he ceded power to G√°lvez. On March 15, 1900, a Brazilian war flotilla reached Puerto Alonso, arrested Galvez and dissolved the Republic of Acre; as the Brazilian government, based on the Treaty of Ayacucho, considered Acre as Bolivian territory. A further reason for Ramalho Junior's interest in Acres occupation was that Galvez had discovered the existence of a diplomatic agreement between Bolivia and the United States stating that there would be military support for Bolivia in the event of war with Brazil.  Second \\"Republic of Acre\\"  Steam Solim√µes. At that time, Bolivia organized a small military mission to occupy the region. Arriving in Porto Acre, it was prevented from continuing its movement by Brazilian rubber tappers. In November 1900 there was another rebellion in order to take Acre from Bolivia and create an independent republic. Known as the \\"Expedition of Poets\\" or \\"Expedition Floriano Peixoto\\", this force, under the command of journalist Orlando Correa Lopes, was based on the river monitor Dovapor Solim√µes, equipped with the help of the governor of Amazonas province, Silv√©rio Jos√© N√©ri. The Solim√µes operated on the Rio Purus and seized the vessel Alonso, which was renamed Ruy Barbosa. Carvalho Rodrigo became president of the newly declared Republic of Acre, whose forces had a light cannon, a machine gun and about 200 men. Around Christmas 1900, this force attacked Puerto Alonso and was defeated by the Bolivian military, resulting in the loss of a dozen men and the machine gun, eventually leading to the dissolution of the republic. On December 29, the Bolivian vessel Rio Afua strengthened the garrison of Puerto Alonso. Although Bolivia deny the agreement with the United States previously mentioned, on June 11, 1901 Bolivia signed a lease with a Bolivian Trading Company (also known as \\"Bolivian Syndicate of New York City\\", or simply \\"Bolivian Syndicate\\"), based in Jersey City, New Jersey. The company had some very influential shareholders, including the king of Belgium and relatives of William McKinley, then president of the United States. Bolivia had given the company almost total control over the Acre province to protect its sovereignty. Under the agreement, the group of U.S. and British capitalists would assume total control over the region, occupying and exploiting it for 30 years. At that time Bolivia was ruled by General Jose Manuel Pando. The number of Brazilians in the region grew, searching forest wealth, mainly in the northeast. Brazil and Peru, which also claimed the territory, strongly disapproved of the lease act. Brazil withdrew the consul of Puerto Alonso and closed the tributaries of the Amazon River to trade with Bolivia. The international powers, who considered the basin as international waters, protested, leading Brazil to reduce the ban to war materials and release the Bolivian goods addressed to foreign nations. Jos√© Pl√°cido de Castro (foto de Percy Fawcett, 1907). At 26 years old, having fought in the Federalist Riograndense Revolution, the gaucho Jos√© Pl√°cido de Castro came to Amazon. In 1902, rubber tappers made a deal with Castro. The military, believing that it could profit from the border struggle, offered Castro to train and command 2000 tappers to fight the Bolivians. At 5 o'clock in the morning of August 6, 1902, Castro led 33 riflemen in canoes on the Acre River. Castro quietly entered a wooden house in the city of Xapuri, in which the Bolivian quartermaster depot was based. Soon, Castro took possession of the site and imprisoned the Bolivian military personnel. The local people mistook the group as part of the celebrations of the Bolivian Independence Day. On September 18, a Bolivian battalion of 180 men, led by Colonel Rosendo Rojas, surprised the forces of Castro, which now had about 70 men. The Brazilians, armed with Winchester rifles, low on ammunition and suffering from tropical diseases and desertions, lost twenty men and were defeated. Castro then recruited another force, with about a thousand men. Part of that force besieged the city of Puerto Alonso on May 19, 1902. On October 14, the force captured some external fortifications and captured the R√≠o Afua, which wrecked on the island during the fighting. The river vessel, renamed Independence, was used against its former owners. Despite the setback, the Bolivians obstinately kept Puerto Alonso. Elsewhere, the Brazilian adventurers besieged Company, which capitulated on 15 October. Other battles, almost all won by the forces of Pl√°cido occurred in Bom Destino, Santa Rosa and other coastal cities. On January 15, 1903, the Brazilian force attacked and captured some positions out of Puerto Alonso. The Independence, anchored upriver, was charged with thirty tons of high-quality rubber and focused on the passage by the Bolivian batteries to bring the river rubber down, which could be sold. The Pl√°cido forces used the money to buy weapons and ammunition. On January 24, the Bolivians in Puerto Alonso surrendered to the rebels, who had taken the entire region. Three days later, on January 27, the Third Republic of Acre was proclaimed, now with the support of President Rodrigues Alves and his Foreign Minister, the Baron of Rio Branco, who ordered the Acre occupation and established a military government under the command of General Olimpio da Silveira. The besieging force advanced towards the place where the rivers Chipamanu (also called Manuripe) and Tahuamanu meet to form the Rio Orton. Soon, a Bolivian force under the command of General Jose Manuel Pando, the Bolivian President, took the opposite bank. However, before it did any significant combat, as a result of the excellent work of diplomacy by the Baron of Rio Branco, the governments of Brazil and Bolivia signed a preliminary treaty on March 21, 1903; finally ratifying the Treaty of Petr√≥polis on November 11, 1903. By said treaty Bolivia gave up Acre in exchange for Brazilian territory from the State of Mato Grosso, the payment of 2 million pounds (~ 640 million reales) and the promise to construct the Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad; linking the Mamor√© River and the Madeira River in order to allow the flow of regional production, particularly rubber. Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brazil actively participated in the negotiations with Bolivia, representing the Brazilian government in its signature. The Bolivian Syndicate was compensated with 110,000 pounds (~ $35 million reales). The taxes collected from Brazilian Acre financed the damages and the loan for the construction of the railway over a course of 30 years. The first of Placido Castro's decrees took place on January 26, 1903, applying Brazilian law until the enactment of a state constitution. It considered valid all land titles issued by Bolivia or the state of Amazonas, defined the Portuguese language as official and adopted the Brazilian monetary standard. The Treaty of Petr√≥polis, signed in 1903 by the Baron of Rio Branco and Assis Brazil, was approved by Brazilian federal law on February 25, 1904, and regulated by a presidential decree of April 7, 1904, incorporating Acre as part of Brazil. Placido de Castro, who died on August 11, 1908, was the first president of the Acre Territory. Castro, the Baron of Rio Branco and Assis Brazil became namesakes of the state capital (Rio Branco) and two counties (Assis Brazil and Pl√°cido de Castro). The Acrean Revolution demonstrated Brazil's advantage over their neighbors because of its downstream location in relation to the rivers that run almost the entire continent, being born in the Andes and flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. Brazil could send reinforcements to the disputed area by the rivers, while the Bolivians had to cross the Andes. Apparently, the Bolivian effort was fully funded by the rubber barons, particularly Nicol√°s Su√°rez Calla√∫. For the second time, Bolivia lost in a war of their plains populated sparsely for a stronger and well-managed neighbor (the first was in the War of the Pacific).  Treaty of Petr√≥polis  In 1867 the \\"Treaty of Peace and Friendship\\", or Ayacucho Bolivia Treaty, had yielded 164,242 square kilometers of area which were annexed by Brazil to the then-province and present state of Amazonas. The Treaty of Petr√≥polis is a peace treaty signed between Bolivia and Brazil in the Brazilian city of Petr√≥polis on November 17, 1903. Bolivia yielded an approximate area of 191,000 square kilometers, which mainly correspond to the current state of Acre, Brazil.

Termed \\"women's gold\\" by Burkinab√© villagers, the nuts of shea tree can be collected and processed by crushing and grinding to yield shea butter, which is widely used in soap and in cosmetics as a moisturizer, salve, or lotion. Shea butter is also edible and may be used in food preparation; it is sometimes used in the manufacture of chocolate. The bark of the tree is also used as an ingredient in traditional medicines and the shell of nut is said to be able to repel mosquitoes and is also said to protect existing trees. Shea nuts are important in the economy of Burkina Faso. It is the country's third most important export, after cotton and livestock. In 1997, an average tonne of unprocessed shea nuts sold domestically for CFA700,000 (US$980) and overseas for CFA1,000,000 (US$1400). The most important centres of shea butter production are in Sissili Province and Ziro Province. Sources Shea butter is an oil extract from the kernel of the sheanut produce of the shea tree Vitellaria paradoxa (syn. Butyrospermum parkii, Butyrospermum paradoxum) (Sapotaceae). It grows profusely in the wild without any special nourishment and attention. Every part of this indigenous tree is found to be useful. Its distribution is exclusive to sub-Saharan West Africa in the savannas, particularly in Burkina Faso where it provides economic sustenance to rural women. Its distribution extends from Senegal to Ethiopia and Uganda over stretch of savanna nearly a thousand kilometers long covering an area of 1 million square km of wooded grassland (about 500 million trees) across 19 countries of the region. The shea tree, though slow in its initial growth, has a useful fruit bearing life span of 15‚Äì20 years. Under indigenous farming system when clearing land for other agricultural activities, Shea trees are preserved and its exclusive plantation is restricted to avoid shading of other crops; however the operations of weeding and management of soil fertility adopted for other crops also facilitates shea tree growth. The shea fruit matures into the shea nut which has the shea kernel within it. The kernel is the source of the shea butter that is extracted through an arduous several hours of processing, over 22 steps, to produce 1 kg of the butter. In Burkina Faso, an impoverished country, it is the exclusive prerogative of rural women who number from 300,000 to 400,000. In the local Dioula language it is known as \\"Si\\" [shi]. The fruits are shaped like large plums and have smooth skin with an egg-shaped nut with the kernel that yields the fatty shea butter. Product The product that is extracted as fat from the kernel of the shea nuts, which has five primary fatty acids namely, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidic; stearic and oleic acids constitute 85‚Äì90% of the fatty acids. Though a fat, it is not extracted in a fluid state like other oils, but is processed in the form of a white, odourless, and nearly tasteless creamy paste or similar to firm butter. The shea butter produced in the Mossi plateau region of Burkina Faso has higher average stearic acid percentage and is thus harder than the shea butter from other West African regions; this is due to scientific inference that the phenolic content in shea kernels varies from region to region. Quality The quality of shea nuts and butter, both of which are also exported in large quantities from Burkina Faso, are basically dependent upon post harvest processing; in this process parboiling of shea nuts is carried out at the beginning of the season as it the eliminates germination and helps in faster drying. Better quality is obtained by sun-drying of the shea nut since smoking the nuts over a fire contaminates it with hydrocarbons. Uses Shea soap The shea butter which is extracted from the shea nuts that is rich in vitamins and minerals, is vital to daily existence of the people as it is used to enhance the \\"taste, texture, and digestibility of the major regional dishes\\" as cooking medium. Other activities related to shea butter that enhances the financial income of the impoverished people consists of use as ingredient to make cosmetics, chocolates (as substitute for cocoa butter) pharmaceutical applications and soap. Soap manufacturers use it typically in small amounts (5‚Äì7% of the oils in the recipe) as it has the property of leaving a small amount of oil in the soap. Other uses include as a waterproofing wax, for hairdressing and for candle-making. Its export potential is on account of its industrial production in Europe for separation into stearin for use with \\"cocoa butter equivalents or improvers (CBEs/CBIs) and margarines, and an oil fraction used as a low- value base for margarines and as a component of animal feeds.\\" Its use is also noted in traditional African percussion instruments to increase the durability of wood (such as carved djembe shells), dried calabash gourds, and leather tuning straps. Medicinal uses Bark of the tree is used to cure ailments in skin treatment in children and treat minor scratches and cuts. Shea unsaponifiables are used as anti-inflammatory treatment for arthritis and a topical treatment for excema and other skin conditions including herpes lesions. A patented product \\"nutraceutical\\" is a shea product that has been developed for lowering cholesterol in humans. Its use as a base for medicinal ointments, has been claimed to have anti-inflammatory, emollient and humectant properties. Exports As an export commodity, the shea nuts, unprocessed shea kernels and processed shea butter, have been important, and in 2000 accounted as Burkina Faso's third most important export; the first two export products were cotton and livestock. Export to Europe for use in manufacture of chocolates was even better in 1970 and 1980s, and amounted to 22,000 tonnes in 1990. However, economic policies of restructuring changed this picture and caused decline in the trade. This created the need for a revisiting of the policies and resulted in participation of the NGOs such the Canadian Centre for International Studies and Cooperation for financial and technical assistance, bilateral donors, Taiwan, the West African Office of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and many others. Women's empowerment In Burkina Faso, women have traditionally played a central role in the extraction of shea butter, from the stage of collection of shea nuts to its final processing into shea butter. However, the improved economic conditions of the shea trade had not permeated to benefit them and as result their participation had remained restricted to their local markets, while the men had garnered the large export market to Europe for the cosmetic industry; the wide disparity in returns to the local women is reflected in the fact that a tonne of unprocessed shea nuts which sold in 1997 locally for CFA 700,000 (US$980) and exported at CFA 1,000,000 (US$1400) sold at CFA 1,480,000 (US$2072) once processed into shea butter; a kilo of butter which sold locally at only a paltry equivalent of 60 cents to the women was worth two to three times as much in the international market. The export earnings were boosted due to shea butter‚Äôs use in cosmetics (for lotions, creams, soaps and other products) by well-known firms such as L'Or√©al, The Body Shop and L'Occitane en Provence. These exports were monitored by UNIFEM to ensure benefits flowed directly to the local women involved in the industry; the L'Occitane purchase was engineered directly, bypassing middlemen, through the Union des groupements Kiswendsida (UGK), a network of more than 100 shea groups set up in Burkina Faso. As a result, shea butter exports for L'Occitane alone recorded an increase from 60 tonnes in 2001 to 90 tonnes in 2002, with greater share of the spoils reaching the women who produced it. The women were also trained in the trade to produce better quality product, as quality had declined in the recent past. This women empowerment process has imparted \\"a certain sense of self-respect among the workers. It has also helped the women producers earn the respect of their family and the right to speak out in the community.\\" See also *Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre, a 2007 film about shea butter production in the country * Shea Yeleen, a social enterprise that empowers and trains women-owned shea butter cooperatives ReferencesExternal links *Association pour la Sauvegarde des Valeurs Traditionelles Category:Economy of Burkina Faso Category:Crops originating from Africa Burkina Faso Category:Plants used in traditional African medicine Category:Women in forestry Category:Women in Burkina Faso ","title":"Shea nut and butter production in Burkina Faso"},{"id":"31584445","text":"In Greek mythology, Arceophon was a wealthy man of Salamis in Cyprus, son of Minnyrides, a Phoenician.

Many Ascension scenes have an upper (Heavenly) and a lower (earthly) part. The Ascension of Jesus to Heaven as stated in the New Testament has been a frequent subject in Christian art, as well as a theme in theological writings.Encyclopedia of World Religions by Johannes P. Schade 2007, entry under Ascension. However, the Ascension of Jesus is not the only depiction of ascension and other figures, such as Saint John, have been separately depicted as ascending to Heaven. The earliest direct depictions of the Ascension date to around the beginnings of the 5th century, often based on the Hand of God representations and by the 6th century the iconography had been established. In many depictions, (and always in the Eastern Church) the Virgin Mary is at the center of the group of Apostles (representing the Church) who look upwards towards the ascending Jesus who usually signals a blessing with his right hand. Development of the iconography Ascension of Christ and Noli me tangere, c. 400, ivory, Milan or Rome, now in Munich. See below for a similar Ascension 450 years later. Testament scenes that appear in the Christian art of the 3rd and 4th centuries typically deal with the works and miracles of Jesus such as healings, the multiplication of the loaves or the raising of Lazarus. Although versions of the subject of Christ in Majesty, which show the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven, appear earlier, the Ascension itself is not depicted until about 400. In early scenes Christ may be shown striding up a mountain, at times the Hand of God reaching from within the clouds to assist him. An ivory plaque in Munich with such a scene is usually dated around 400, and is possibly the earliest Ascension image.Kerbrat, Pierre. \\"Ascension\\" in Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Volume 2, Richard Barrie Dobson et al., p. 113, Routledge, 2000, This was to remain the most common type in the West for several centuries, and for example is repeated in the Drogo Sacramentary some 450 years later (see gallery). The crucifixion scene is virtually unknown in the 5th century and rare until the 6th century. By the 6th century, however, more images of both the Crucifixion and the Ascension began to appear, perhaps as a result of the theological discussions of the late 4th and early 5th centuries. The Rabbula Gospels (c. 586) include some of the earliest images of the Crucifixion and Ascension, and in their Ascension depictions the Virgin Mary occupies a central position among the Apostles;Robin M. Jensen \\"Art in Early Christianity\\" in The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History by Robert Benedetto 2008 pp. 51‚Äì53 Christ appears in a mandorla above, accompanied by angels. This was to remain the standard Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox depiction. By the 6th century the iconography of the Ascension had been established and by the 9th century Ascension scenes were being depicted on domes of churches.Festival Icons for the Christian Year by John Baggley 2000 pp. 137‚Äì138 In some representations there may be no mountain and he may be climbing a mandorla, or be lifted towards Heaven in a mandorla by angels. In Romanesque depictions sometimes just the feet of Christ are shown as he disappears up into the clouds; this depiction became the most popular in Northern Europe, where it lingered in provincial wood reliefs until well after the Reformation. Sometimes the last two footprints of Christ on the rock are seen; these were shown to pilgrims at what is now the Chapel of the Ascension on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. The scene may also include the Apostles, two men in white and the Virgin Mary.Medieval Art: a Topical Dictionary by Leslie Ross 1996 pp. 25‚Äì26 Structure and representation Ascension in the Rabbula Gospels, 6th century. Ascension scenes fall naturally into two zones, an upper heavenly part and a lower earthly part. The ascending Christ may be carrying a resurrection banner or make a sign of benediction with his right hand.Renaissance Art: a Topical Dictionary by Irene Earls 1987 pp. 26‚Äì27 The blessing gesture by Christ with his right hand is directed towards the earthly group below him and signifies that he is blessing the entire Church. In the left hand he may be holding a Gospel or a scroll, signifying teaching and preaching.The Meaning of Icons by Leonide Ouspensky, Vladimir Lossky 1999 p. 197 From the Renaissance on the angels may not be present. The earthly part of the Ascension depictions do not only represent those believed to have been present at the Ascension, but the entire Church.The Icon: Window on the Kingdom by Michel Quenot 1992 p. 61 In some Ascension depictions both Apostle Paul and the Virgin Mary may be present. Given Paul converted to Christianity after the Ascension, and that the New Testament does not directly place the Virgin Mary at the Ascension, these depictions represent \\"the Church\\" rather than the specific individuals.Christian Iconography: a Study of its Origins by Andr√© Grabar 1968 Taylor & Francis Publishers, p. 76 In Orthodox icons the Virgin Mary is at the center and Christ can be depicted in a mandorla, supported by angels. Christ may be crowned in many such depictions. Given that the Gospels do not mention that the Virgin Mary was a witness to the Ascension, her presence of the Virgin Mary in 5th and 6th century depictions of the Ascension such as those in the Rabbula Gospels are an indication of the important role she played in the art of that period.Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective by Fred S. Kleiner 2000 pp. 244‚Äì245 The Eastern Orthodox portrayal of the Ascension is a major metaphor for the mystical nature of the Church. Orthodox tradition holds that the Virgin Mary was present during the Ascension and the Great Vespers of the Ascension state: \\"She who as your Mother suffered at your Passion more than all, should also enjoy the surpassing joy of the glorifying of your flesh.\\" Thus in many Eastern icons the Virgin Mary is placed at the center of the scene in the earthly part of the depiction, with her hands raised towards Heaven, often accompanied by various Apostles.The mystical language of icons by Solrunn Nes 2005 p. 87 The upwards looking depiction of the earthly group matches the Eastern liturgy on the Feast of the Ascension: \\"Come, let us rise and turn our eyes and thoughts high...\\" Icons are an inherent part of the liturgy of the Eastern Church and icons of the Ascensions are used in the procession on the feast of the Ascension.The Spirituality of the Rites of the Holy Liturgy in the Coptic Orthodox Church by Bishop Mettaous 2000, Orthodox Church Press, pp. 133‚Äì134 Other scenes with a similar raised figure, that used similar compositions to the Ascension are the Assumption of Mary, rare until the late Middle Ages, the Transfiguration of Jesus, and from the Early Renaissance the Resurrection of Jesus, where he begins to be seen floating clear of the tomb. Perhaps the earliest surviving works to show this iconography of the Resurrection is the well-known fresco by Andrea da Firenze in the Spanish Chapel of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, which dates to 1366.Elly Cassee, Kees Berserik and Michael Hoyle, The Iconography of the Resurrection: A Re-Examination of the Risen Christ Hovering above the Tomb, 1984, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 126, No. 970 (Jan., 1984), pp. 20‚Äì24 JSTOR Gallery=Western churchPaintings and mosaic= File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -38- - Ascension.jpgGiotto, 14th century File:Andrea Mantegna 012.jpgAndrea Mantegna, 1461 File:Pietro Perugino cat48c.jpgPietro Perugino 1496‚Äì1500 File:Himmelfahrt Christi.jpg16th century, German \\"disappearing feet\\" File:Benvenuto Tisi da Garofalo - Ascension of Christ - WGA08474.jpgGarofalo, 1510‚Äì1520 File:Rembrandt van Rijn 192.jpgRembrandt, 1636 File:The Ascension) by Benjamin West, PRA.jpgBenjamin West 1801 File:ND Rosaire mosa√Øque 03.jpgRosary Basilica, Lourdes, 19th century =Illuminated manuscripts= File:Enluminure Drogon c.jpgDrogo Sacramentary, c. 850 File:BambergApocalypse10Ascension.JPGBamberg Apocalypse, 11th century File:Folio 184r - The Ascension.jpgTr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, c. 1410 File:Bottega di domenico ghirlandaio, ascensione, antifonario edili 148 f. 47v. biblioteca medicea laurenziana.jpgWorkshop of Ghirlandaio, 15th century =Relief depictions= File:Himmelfahrt Christi BNM MA158.jpgAnglo-Saxon(?) ivory relief, 8th century File:Himmelfahrt Christi c 800.jpgUnusual Anglo-Saxon or Alpine, ivory box cover, c. 750‚Äì800, with Mary and the Evangelists' symbols File:Ribe domkirke - Kanzel 6 Himmelfahrt.jpgA rather late version of the \\"disappearing feet\\" depiction in wood relief, 1597 File:Aulendorf Pfarrkirche Stuckdecke Christi Himmelfahrt.jpgChrist ascending alone, Aulendorf, Germany, 1711 Eastern churchIcons and mosaic= File:Dome_de_saint_sava_avec_christ_pantocrator.jpgBiggest mosaic of Ascension of Jesus in Christian world which weighs 40 tons in central dome of Saint Sava Cathedral in Belgrade File:The Ascension of Our Lord.jpg14th century Novgorod School File:Ascension from Vasilyevskiy chin (15th c., GTG).jpgAndrei Rublev, 1408 File:Ascension (Kirillo-Belozersk).jpgSt. Cyril- Belozersky Monastery, 1497 File:Voznesenie Sv.

Its outflow is called Rein da Tuma and after a few kilometers, it forms the Vorderrhein/Rein Anteriur (). The course of this river is not particularly representative, after about two kilometers, its water is diverted into Curnera reservoir. The water is released at the Tavanase plant and flows into the Rhine at Ilanz. The river begins to be called Rhine in the vicinity of Chur, more specifically, at the confluence of the Vorderrhein and Hinterrhein/Rein Posteriur () next to Reichenau in Tamins.  Criteria for distinguishing between main branches and tributaries  There are different criteria for the definition of tributaries, and by some definitions, irrespective of the official name, one strand or another may be called the source. Determining the source of the Rhine is difficult, because in the river system of the Anterior and Posterior Rhine, there are many headwaters of similar size. Apart from the common criterion of the (apparent or real) larger discharge, ongoing cartographic research allows us to determine the headwater with the greatest length, the largest catchment area or (occasionally) the highest source. The direction of flow may be crucial to the nomenclature as may be the significance of the valleys as room for housing and transport. Both criteria are more appropriate to the Vorderrhein, since the Hinterrhein valley was hardly populated before the influx of the Walser.  Rhine sources by name  Sign \\"source of the Rhine\\" at the Lake Toma The Swiss Federal Office of Topography and ETH Z√ºrichTrial version of the Atlas of Switzerland with flashing rivers indicate a point north of Lake Toma and the Rein da Tuma as the source of the Rhine (and also of the Vorderrhein), and as the source of the Hinterrhein a point in the upper valley of the Rheinwald, east of the Rheinwaldhorn. In the area of the headwaters of the Rhine, the term Rhine is used as part of the name of many rivers, in many different spellings, such as Rhine, Rein, Rain, Ragn, Ren, Reno and Rin.  Source of the Rhine according to maximum discharge  The Dischmabach in Dischma valley, the most distant source of the Hinterrhein river system and largest source of the Alpine Rhine If one were to use largest discharge as one's criterion for deciding which flow should be called Rhine, one need not look at eastern Switzerland at all, since the Aare has a larger discharge then the Rhine at the confluence. However, in the rest of this article, the Aare will be ignored. The source of the main flow path can be obtained by following the river upstream and determining at each junction which the larger river. At the confluence of the Vorderrhein and Hinterrhein (forming the Rhine) at Reichenau, the average of the Vorderrhein is 53.8 m¬≥/s and the discharge of the Hinterrhein is somewhat larger at 59.6 m¬≥/s.Hydrological Atlas of Switzerland 2002, table 5.4, Natural outflows in 1961--1980 (Extract) At the mouth of the Albula, in the natural state, the latter is larger than the Hinterrhein (29.1 m¬≥/s for the Albula compared with 27.3 m¬≥/s for the Hinterrhein). At the mouth of the Landwasser, the latter is significantly larger (9.45 m¬≥/s compared to 5.57 m¬≥/s). Among the headwaters of the Landwasser in the Davos area, the Dischmabach is slightly larger than the Fl√ºelabach, even if considering the former small tributary flowing out of Lake Davos. This implies that the hydrological main branch starts at the top of the Dischma, far away from greater rivers bearing the name \\"Rhine\\". The current values of the average discharge are rather different from the natural values, because many hydropower plants draw water from outside their natural catchment and this water bypasses some gauging stations.The gauging stations can be found on the website of the Swiss Federal Office for Environment (\\"BAFU\\") Basic monitoring network: water levels and discharge in surface waters Water is retrieved from southern parts of the Vorderrhein watershed and released into the Hinterrhein, or taken from the Hinterrhein and released into the Albula, or taken from the Landwasser and Albula and released into the lower Hinterrhein (e.g. Albula-Landwasser Hydropower). In the upper Landwasser Valley, water is retrieved from the Fl√ºelabach and Davosersee and released in a neighbouring valley near Aeua in the Klosters area.  Source of the Rhine by length  Near the \\"source of the Rhine\\" at Lake Toma, there is a well known sign with the erroneous information, \\"1320 km to the mouth\\"; it is only about 1230 km). The number of 1320 km is widespread. It is unclear whether this statement refers to the river length as measured from Lake Toma. This number may be the result of transposing digits. The Rein da Medel (at Pard√©), the mouth most distant source of both the Vorderrhein river system and the Rhine system as a whole The flow path from the source in Lake Toma through Rein da Tuma measures about 71 km to the confluence of the Vorderrhein and Hinterrhein. From there it is more about 1160 km downriver to the North Sea. There are, however, some longer flow paths in the Vorderrhein area. Measuring the longest path from the source to the confluence at Reichenau: * About 76 km: Rein da Medel (the central part is also known as Froda; the headwaters in Ticino are known as Reno di Medel) * About 75 km: Rein da Maighels (a tributary of the Rein da Curnera) * About 74 km: Rein da Curnera * About 71 km: Rein da Tuma (counting Lake Toma and the longest stream into the lake) * About 71 km: Rein da Nalps * About 70 km: two unnamed streams descending from the Puozas and Milez areas close to the Oberalp Pass * About 70 km: the Aua da Val, descending from the valley Val, which disappears under a moraine at an altitude of 2367 m and reappears on a ledge some distance lower * About 69.5 km: Aua da Urlaun, a tributary of the Rein da Tuma The flow paths in the Hinterrheins tend to be slightly shorter: * About 72 km: Dischmabach * About 70 km: Fl√ºelabach * About 64 km: Hinterrhein * About 64 km: Totalpbach (a former headwater of the Landwasser; now flows into Lake Davos and from there the water is artificially piped to Klosters) * About 63 km: Gelgia * About 61 km: Madrischer Rhein * About 56 km: The Ava da Ravais, headwater of the Albula flows east from Berg√ºn * About 53 km: a headwater of the Albula descending from the Crap Alv Laiets near the Albula Pass The longest headwater of both the Vorderrhein and the Rhine as a whole, therefore, is the Reno di Medel, rising about 7.5 km south of Lake Toma. Its spring and upper reaches are located west of the Lukmanier Pass in the municipality of Quinto in Ticino.  Size of the catchment areas  The catchment area of the Vorderrhein covers about 1512 km¬≤; the basin of the Hinterrhein (including the Albula and Landwasser), is slightly larger at 1693 km¬≤. The percentage of precipitation flowing down the river is fairly similar in the valleys of the headwaters of the Rhine, so the size of the catchment area tends to be proportional to the average discharge, and therefore this criterion does not need to be considered separately.  Summary  Hinterrhein near Spl√ºgen No clear hierarchy can be established among the headwaters of the Rhine. The two main systems, the Vorderrhein in the west and the Hinterrhein in the south and east, differ only slightly in length, discharge and size of their catchment areas. The longest paths begin in the upper Surselva (valley of the Rein Anteriur) and the upper Landwasser Valley, respectively the most western and the most eastern parts of the headwaters area. The source of the hydrological main path would be found in the east, in the Dischma (valley of the Dischmabach).

He was a prolific author, and recognised as one of the world's leading experts on Italian art of the early Renaissance. Borenius also served as a diplomat liaising between Finland and Britain. It has been argued that during World War II he worked as a spy for the British MI6, and was instrumental in enticing Rudolf Hess to fly to Britain in 1941. Career Borenius was the son of Finnish businessman and politician Carl Borenius. He studied at Helsinki and in Italy. He received his Ph.D. from Helsinki University in 1909, after which he moved to London. His first book was a version of his doctoral dissertation, Painters of Vincenza (1909). He married Anne-Marie Runeberg, a granddaughter of the Finnish poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg. Borenius soon met Roger Fry, to whom he became close. Fry introduced him to the art circles in Britain, and he became associated with the Bloomsbury group. Borenius was appointed in 1914 as a lecturer at University College London after Fry left. In 1921, he prepared a catalogue of the Northwick Park collection. After Henry Tonks had established the Edwin Durning-Lawrence chair in art history at the university, Borenius was appointed its first professor in 1922.University College, History of Art department . In 1933 he became director of the excavations of Clarendon Palace near Salisbury, where he continued to dig regularly until 1939. Though initially a specialist on Italian art, Borenius became increasingly interested in the art of his adopted country. His opinion on art was highly valued, and he worked as a consultant at Sotheby's. He was also an advisor to the Earl of Harewood's art collection. He helped to found the art magazine Apollo in 1925, and became one of its most active contributors. He was also actively involved with The Burlington Magazine, of which he became managing editor during World War II from 1940 to 1945. He wrote numerous books on art, including English Primitives (1924), The Iconography of St. Thomas of Canterbury (1929), Florentine Frescoes (1930), English Painting in the XVIIIth Century (1938) and Rembrandt: Selected Paintings (1942). Diplomacy When Finland became independent of Russia, he acted as secretary of the diplomatic mission (1918) and as representative of Finland in London from 1919. In World War II this role became important as Britain initially sought to cultivate links to Finland, which had been attacked by Soviet Russia during the Winter War, as part of the Nazi-Soviet pact. When Germany invaded Russia, Finland became a de facto ally of the Nazis against the Russians. Finnish leader Field Marshal Mannerheim was careful to keep his distance from Hitler and maintain links to the Western Allies.Vehvil√§inen, Olli (2002), Finland in the Second World War: Between Germany and Russia, New York: Palgrave. Borenius knew Mannerheim, and during the Winter War he wrote a laudatory biography of the general.J. E. O. Screen, Mannerheim: the years of preparation, C. Hurst & Co, 2001, pp. 4‚Äì5. Borenius was made Secretary-General of the Polish Relief Fund in 1939, created to send aid to Poland and assist Polish refugees in Britain. He had long cultivated links between Poland, Finland and Britain, having been vice- president of the Anglo-Polish society before the war. The anti-Nazi journal Free Europe referred to him as \\"a living symbol of Polish-Finnish collaboration\\".Free Europe: Central and East European Affairs, Volume 1, 1939, p. 48. Hess claims The writer John Harris asserts Rudolf Hess: Treachery and Deception - Jema 2016 that Borenius was sent by the British MI6 to Geneva in January 1941. The perilous journey was via Bristol (Whitchurch) to Lisbon (Sintra) by KLM DC-3, and then to Geneva via rail across Spain and Vichy France. The minute book of the Polish Relief FundLondon Metropolitan Archive records Borenius' absence from mid-January to mid-March 1941. The diary of Ulrich von Hassell also records the trip and Borenius' eventual meeting with Carl Jacob Burckhardt, a leader of the International Red Cross.Von Hassell Diaries (published 1947 and 2010),. Harris also interviewed Borenius' son, Peter, who told him that Claude Dansey of MI6 had supplied a cyanide pill that was \\"the size of a golf ball\\". The diary entry makes it clear that Borenius was there to impart the knowledge that Britain was still ready to talk peace \\"though not for much longer\\". The key question, Harris argues, is on whose authority was Borenius sent. In the original German diaries, Von Hassell states that Borenius was sent by English stellen, which provokes the key question. Who were the English stellen: MI6, royalty, or was it merely a clever ruse? Throughout the 1930s, Borenius's royal connections had flourished. He was art advisor to the Lascelles family and had accompanied Queen Mary to Yorkshire when visiting her daughter Mary. Notwithstanding that question, Burckhardt clearly acted on the information and by 10 March, Albrecht Haushofer, Rudolf Hess's intermediary, was aware of the meeting and what was discussed. Von Hassell diaries It was on the pretext of a Haushofer/Burckhardt meeting that Albrecht travelled to Geneva on 28 April 1941. A fortnight later, Hess flew to Scotland.Rudolf Hess: Treachery and Deception ‚Äì Jema May 2016 Haushofer had returned to Germany via Arosa in Switzerland, where he visited Ilse von Hassell, staying with her recuperating son at the Hotel Isla. It is Harris' contention that at this meeting the necessary navigational information was passed to Hess (via Haushofer) in connection with the forthcoming flight. A year earlier, the British amateur diplomat James Lonsdale-Bryans had used the exact same location and venue as part of his 'semi official' peace negotiations. The Von Hassell family returned home to Bavaria on May 16th 1941. Borenius had returned to London by mid-March 1941 (having been refused entry into Italy) and resumed his secretarial duties to the Anglo-Polish relief organisation. Shortly after his return he met General Sikorski, prior to his departure for the United States. Cazalet journals - Eton College, Berkshire Sikorski would return to Britain on 11 May 1941, landing at Prestwick, Ayrshire, literally a few hours after Hess had crashed at nearby Eaglesham. Historian Roger Moorhouse, author of Berlin at War, disputed the claims, stating that \\"MI6 would have little to gain from luring Hess to Britain. Although nominally important, he was actually a peripheral figure by 1941. (Harris disagrees, making the point that Hess was essentially Party chairman, responsible for party organisation and integration of the captured territories into the Reich.) The most likely theory, according to Moorhouse is that he came over of his own volition.\\"\\"Rudolf Hess 'was lured to Britain by MI6 plot'\\", The Daily Telegraph, 26 Oct, 2010. Death Borenius was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, in 1946 and transferred to Laverstock House, near Salisbury, where he died in September 1948. Both hospitals specialised in the treatment of mental disorders. Both he and his wife are buried in Coombe Bissett churchyard. Recognition In March 2017 a Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea blue plaque was affixed to 28, Kensington Gate and unveiled by the Finnish Ambassador. Afterwards a seminar was held at the nearby Finnish Embassy to discuss his life.

The story follows an ambitious, but impoverished young man, who seduces women of high social standing in order to improve his prospects; an Icarus of the post-Napoleonic era.  Adaptation  The series is a faithful adaptation of the novel Le Rouge et le Noir and is condensed into four episodes, each 50 minutes in length. A notable addition to the plot is the figure of Napoleon, which the protagonist, Julien Sorel, envisages during the main turning points of the story. Napoleon represents Julien's ambition in the serial, he compares himself with the French hero, seeing himself as an extraordinary individual.

Julien leaves behind his poor and uncouth father and brothers to take a position negotiated by the Abb√© Ch√©nal as tutor to local Mayor M. de R√™nal's three sons. Julien impresses Madame de R√™nal with his gentle nature and sense of fun when dealing with his young charges. Julien is asked to illustrate his astounding power of memory by quoting passages from the Bible in Latin at a dinner hosted by the conceited M. de R√©nal, who revels in showing-off to various local dignitaries the latest addition to his household. A love affair begins between Madame de R√™nal and Julien. Madame de R√™nal, a pious woman, is torn between her passion for Julien and religious guilt. The apparition of Napoleon to Julien signifies Julien's relentless ambition as a romantic hero, and encourages the conquest. During a visit by the King of France, Madame de R√™nal arranges for Julien to appear in the parade as one of the military guard on horseback. Julien relishes the role, galloping back to change into his cassock in order to be part of the religious procession for the King's visit to the local church. The switching from the scarlet of the military uniform and the black cassock of the church indicates Julien's personal battle between truth and hypocrisy, his humble beginnings and the upper classes. Eliza, the R√™nal's housemaid and secret admirer of Julien, learns of the affair and tells M. de R√™nal's rival Monsieur Valenod. Eliza hopes to marry Julien, even though he has made no indication of returning her love, and seeks to end the adulterous affair. Returning from the festivities, Madame de R√™nal finds one of her sons has been taken seriously ill, and believes that this is a punishment from God for her affair with Julien. This, however, does not prevent them from embracing, and then collapsing onto the floor at the ill child's bedside. Episode two A letter is received by M. de R√™nal, exposing the love affair between his wife and servant. Madame de R√™nal double bluffs her husband, stating that the affair is an invention and plot constructed by M. Valenod in order to employ Julien himself and get one over his rival, R√™nal. At confession, Eliza whispers to the Father Ch√©lan of the scandalous affair. Julien is sent to the seminary at Besan√ßon by Father Ch√©lan in disgrace. He is unpopular with his fellow students and finds an unlikely friendship in Father Pirard, director of the seminary. Grotesquely ugly, Father Pirard stands alone, for he is a man of truth and honesty, in the corrupt world of the church, which Julien witnesses for the first time. Father Pirard is removed from his post at the seminary as he fails to support the Abb√© de Frilair and sides with the Marquis de la Mole. Concerned for Julien's future, Father Pirard secures Julien a position as secretary to the Marquis in Paris. Julien moves within the social circles of the Marquis' children, and learns the manners and customs of the aristocracy. Mathilde takes a particular interest in Julien, however, he chides her advances, believing her to be a proud and spoiled young woman. Julien is scoffed at in the street and challenges the offender to a duel. Julien demands to know his name, which is given as the Comte de Beauvoisis. The next day on arrival at the Comte's residence, and seeing that the Comte is not the man who slighted him, Julien recognises the Comte's chauffeur as the true culprit, the Comte being a man of honor carries out the duel with Julien, whom he presumes is a nobleman. Both men survive (albeit Julien with a superficial wound to the arm) and find the confusion of identity rather amusing and become friends. Episode three Julien is given a blue coat by the Marquis, as the Comte de Beauvoisis has begun a rumour that Julien is in fact the son of a close friend and ally of the Marquis. This suits the Marquis in his plans for Julien and gives the story credence with the presentation of the blue coat. Mathilde becomes appealing to Julien, as he realises that she has intellect and spirit. Encouraged again by the figure of Napoleon, Julien accepts an invitation by Mathilde to visit her that night, believing that she and her friends are toying with him. Mathilde and Julien spend the night together but the next day, Mathilde rejects him, disgusted that she would give herself to a lowly servant. Hurt by her rejection, Julien seeks to escape and asks the Marquis if he may leave Paris and visit one of his country estates. The Marquis, however, has greater plans for his young prot√©g√© and challenges Julien to memorise a newspaper article, testing his abilities of memory. Shortly after their affair, Julien is sent on an undercover mission by the Marquis to London, where he is to deliver a secret message to the Duke of Wellington which he has committed to memory. In London he encounters the Comte de Beauvoisis. Julien confides in the Comte that he is unhappy in love as his love for a young woman in Paris is unrequited. The Comte tries to aid Julien by giving him a packet of English love letters for Julien to copy and send to Madame de Fervaques, in order to make Mathilde jealous. On his return to Paris, Julien relays to the Marquis that the Duke of Wellington is not willing to help his cause, however, for secret services rendered to the crown, Julien is given the Legion of Honour by the Marquis de la Mole. Episode four Julien starts his campaign to win Madame de Fervaques, a pure and devout woman. This has the desired effect on Mathilde and she surrenders herself to Julien, visiting his room at great cost to her reputation. During Mathilde's eighteenth birthday party, Mathilde reveals to Julien that she is pregnant with his child. Mathilde discloses her condition to her father, who is outraged at his secretary's betrayal. Julien leaves Paris and stays with Father Pirard. Mathilde convinces her father to arrange an army commission for Julien to enroll as a Lieutenant of the Hussars. Julien is popular and successful in his new position. The Marquis has agreed that after three months separation, his daughter and Julien may marry if they still wish to do so. The Marquis receives a letter from Madame de R√™nal, who feels obliged to inform him of Julien's past, that he preys on weak and lonely women in order to build a position for himself. Without explanation to Mathilde, Julien returns to his home town in his scarlet uniform. On entering the local church he finds Madame de R√™nal at prayer, and aiming his pistols shoots her twice. Julien is imprisoned and later put on trial. Julien thinks he has killed Madame de R√™nal. Mathilde seeks help from the church by speaking to the Abb√© de Frilair. He states that he controls the jury, and that the foreman of the jury has lately been made a local mayor, this is Monsieur Valenod. Julien is found guilty of attempted murder and is sentenced to death. Madame de R√™nal recovers from her injuries and her love for Julien is reawakened. She visits Julien in prison and he realises that he truly loves her. Mathilde loves Julien, even though she is aware that he loves Madame de R√™nal. Julien asks Mathilde to take courage and forget him. Julien is guillotined. Mathilde takes his severed head and buries it in a cave, which she has created as her shrine to him. Madame de R√™nal dies of a broken heart, shortly after Julien's death.

At one point it was the oldest department store in America, operating for over 150 years from its founding in 1825 to its closing in 1975. At the company's peak, its flagship \\"Palace of Trade\\" in Manhattan - located at 881-887 Broadway at East 19th Street, through to 115 Fifth Avenue - was acknowledged to be the store which took the largest portion of the \\"carriage trade\\", in New York, serving the rich and elite of the city, such as the wives of Grover Cleveland, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt. History Arnold Constable & Company began as a small dry goods store at 91 Front Street in lower Manhattan opened in 1825 by Aaron Arnold, who had immigrated to the United States from the Isle of Wight. Arnold moved the business to a larger space on Pine Street, and took on partners, his nephews George and James Hearn, with the business being known as Arnold and Hearn until 1842, when the Hearns began their own store. James Mansell Constable was an employee of A. Arnold & Co. who would later marry Arnold's daughter, and he was taken on as a partner in 1842, with the store name changing to Arnold Constable & Company in 1853.Pearson, pp.85-86 The Arnold Constable buildings at 307-311 Canal Street, with the red-brick Mercer Street facade. 309-311 (at the corner) is the original building, and 307 (center of block) was an addition. The upper floors of the Fifth Avenue facade, with the 19th Street facade on the left, going east towards Broadway  Migrations and expansions  In 1857 the store moved into a four-story white marble dry goods palace located at 309-311 CanalWhite & Willsensky, p.103 with frontages on Howard, and Mercer Streets. A few years later as the country suffered from inflation, the store became one of the first to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis. The firm continued to expand, and in 1862 added a five-story building at 307 Canal, as well as a fifth-story to the original building. The new additions were aesthetically integrated with the existing structure. Recognized as an emporium for high-quality fashions, the store soon outgrew its Canal Street store, and in 1869 the firm erected a marble building on Broadway and East 19th Street, designed by Griffith Thomas, in an area which would become known as the \\"Ladies' Mile\\" Shopping District. The store was one of the pioneers of this shopping district, being among the first to move there.Pearson, pp.11-13 At the time, Arnold Constable was the second largest dry goods store in the city, and the building was called the \\"Palace of Trade\\" by newspapers.\\"New Arnold Constable Store\\" The New York Times (August 4, 1937) The building was expanded in 1872, adding carpets to its inventory and an upholstery department, and then extended all the way through the block to Fifth Avenue in 1876-77 to accommodate a wholesale department. Arnold Constable was then said to be \\"one of the largest business establishments in the world,\\" and the business was so profitable that the New York Herald reported in 1897 that the company was the fifth largest real-estate owner in New York City. Among the properties the company owned was an office building at Fifth Avenue and East 18th Street, which connected to the firm's gigantic emporium. Despite Arnold's death in 1876 the business continued to expand over the years until it was necessary to follow the city's uppertens population uptown and move into an even larger space at Fifth Avenue and 40th Street in 1914, the site of the former Vanderbilt mansion, and now the Mid-Manhattan Library of the New York Public Library.  European expansion  Clark Lawrence Sharpstein (1807-1880) started was a clerk at Arnold's nephew's store before moving to Arnold, Constable when it was still on Canal Street. He quickly gained a senior position at the company, and was one of the drivers behind the move to Broadway. Arnold sent him on buying trips to Paris. In 1855, he established a Paris branch of Arnold, Constable, becoming a partner in the overall firm. He continued to run the Paris store until his death, except for a one-year leave in 1870. The European business also included a London store; a lithograph depicting that store is in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art.  Later years  In 1925, Arnold Constable joined with the specialty retailer Stewart & Company and expanded into the suburbs. In 1937, the first suburban branch opened in New Rochelle, New York. Later suburban expansions included locations in Hempstead and Manhasset on Long Island, Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and in New Jersey. Most branch stores were in downtown areas, often in small shopping centers. There were 11 to 12 American stores in the 1960s before business declined, a victim of the growth of malls over standalone stores. Eventually, the 10 suburban branches closed. In 1961, Arnold, Constable sold its main store to the New York Public Library for its Mid-Manhattan Branch, but leased the first few floors back from the library to continue operating the store. By July 1974, it terminated the lease on all but the ground floor space. In March 1975, it closed down the main store altogether. Smaller mall stores continued and even expanded, under the NoName and Garment District brands. The NoName stores literally had no name and no logo. A logo design was trademarked but never used. In the 1990s, remaining operations were sold to Canadian retailer Y M Inc., which now operates US chains Annie Sez, Mandee, and Afaze. The \\"Palace of Trade\\" The second Arnold Constable flagship store now located in the Ladies' Mile Historic District began as the second of two twin buildings with marble facades, both designed by architect Griffith Thomas in Second Empire Commercial style,Pearson, pp.83-84 the other being for the retailer Edward Hoyt, who moved uptown to the area at about the same time as Arnold Constable. Later alterations to the buildings have obscured their identical beginning.Pearson, p.79 The Arnold Constable building grew by accretion over time, with sections divided by brick firewalls, but the interiors were kept as open as possible, supported by only cast-iron columns to allow for flexibility in displaying merchandise. In later years, sections would be connected together with courts naturally lit with skylights. As well as sales floors, the building contained warehouse storage space and workshops.Pearson, p.17 The first major alteration to the building occurred in 1872, with a extension along 19th Street, adding a side entrance. The \\"miraculous\\"White & Willensky, p.195 two-story mansard roof was also added at that time. Four years later, another was added, bringing the building to Fifth Avenue. Griffith Thomas did both extensions, and followed his original design, except that the ornamentation was done in cheaper cast iron rather than in the more expensive marble of the original building. In 1883-84, an annex was added on 18th Street, which was connected to the main building by a four-story bridge, and directly at the ground floor and basement. This building was designed by William Schickel in Renaissance Revival style.Pearson, p.523 In 1894, a twelve-story tower, also designed by Schickel, was added at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and East 18th Street. Originally intended for ground floor retail with manufacturing above, the upper floors were redesignated for office use before the building was completed in 1895.Pearson, p.222 After Arnold Constable & Company moved farther uptown in 1914, the building was converted, in 1915, for wholesale use. The \\"Palace of Trade\\" was well-thought- of as architecture. The New York Herald said of the completed building: \\"By a nice arrangement and symmetrical adaptation of all its parts the massiveness of the structure is pleasantly relieved, and the building thus rendered, from an architectural point of view, one of the finest edifices in the city.\\" References Notes Bibliography *Arnold Constable history * *Pearson, Marjorie (ed.)

He was renowned as just and wise, and was one day visited by Apollo, Artemis, and Heracles who asked him to act as an arbiter in their argument as to which of the three should become patron of Ambracia, Epirus. Apollo argued that the city should belong to him on account of the fact that Epirus was once conquered by his son Melaneus, and that he assisted the Ambraciotes in the war against the natives of Epirus, and brought law and order to Ambracia. Artemis reminded that it was she who saved the Ambraciotes from the tyrant Phalecus, having sent a lioness to kill him. Finally, Heracles brought up the fact that it was he who destroyed the many non-Greek peoples of Epirus for trying to steal the kine of Geryon from him, and that the Corinthians, who later came to Epirus and founded Ambracia, were his descendants. Cragaleus considered Heracles' argument the most convincing and declared him the winner. Apollo was enraged and turned Cragaleus into stone. Since then, the Ambraciotes sacrificed to Apollo the Saviour, but believed their city to belong to Heracles and the Heracleidae, and honored Cragaleus with sacrifices as well.

Early life Oscar Wegner was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Dalmira Ofelia Jimenez and Oscar Pablo Wegner, Chief Engineer of Argentinian government oil fields in Comodoro Rivadavia (YPF) and an initiator of Aero Club Comodoro Rivadavia. He attended the Instituto Euskal-Echea, Liceo Naval Militar Almirante Guillermo Brown and Colegio San Jose. At the age of 12 he learned to sail at the Club Yacimientos de Petroliferos Fiscales,Club Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales-Capital Federal Camino De La Ribera S/N 1642 San Isidro Buenos Aires marking the beginning of a lifelong love of the sport. Later he joined the Club Nautico San Isidro, where he continued sailing, and at age 14 took up tennis, soon becoming the #1 junior player at his club and entering national tournaments. Beginning at 15 years of age and in the next few years he saw Jack Kramer, Pancho Gonzales, Tony Trabert, Lew Hoad and Ken Rosewall play in Buenos Aires and began to model some of his strokes after theirs. Notable players in Argentina he looked up to at the time were Enrique Morea and Eduardo Soriano. Seeing those players travel the world he decided he would try it himself. By the age of 16 he had earned a 100-ton motorsailer vessel pilot's license and was acting as chair umpire for finals of international tournaments in Buenos Aires.World Tennis Magazine Cover Photo: Karol Fageros, top US player Oscar Wegner umpire, June Hanson number one female player in Argentina 1955 After graduating from secondary school he studied engineering and surveying at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, was drafted into the Argentine Air Force. He later decided to join the international tennis circuit. He played his first tennis tournament outside Argentina in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay in 1961, beginning an enthusiasm for traveling which has continued throughout his life. Wegner made his first trip to Brazil in 1962 to meet his father's cousin German Frers who was in the Buenos Aires ‚Äì Rio sailboat race, which his cousin had won in 1950. In Rio de Janeiro Wegner practiced tennis with Lucy Maia at Fluminense Football Club, attended soccer matches and fell in love with the country. He returned on several occasions to enjoy the city, visit friends and play tennis with locals such as Jorge Paulo Lemann and coach Pepe Aguero at the Country Club of Rio de Janeiro. Touring career Oscar Wegner played on the international tennis circuit from 1963‚Äì67. After completing his military service he traveled through South America, the Caribbean, Europe, then Africa, back to Europe, the US and back to South America. The challenge of traveling around the world with the small budget of a few hundred dollars of \\"under the table\\" expenses paid by the tournaments was very exciting to the young Wegner, and in 5 years he visited over 30 countries and met numerous top players and local personalities.The Pretoria News ‚Äì Photo: \\"International players at present touring South Africa ‚Äì in this picture Anne Haydon Jones (England), Pretoria Mayor Prof. PJ van der Walt, Oscar Wegner (Argentina), Dierdre Cutt (England)\\" March 2, 1964 His friendship with top players, including Manolo Santana, Roy Emerson and Martin Mulligan, helped him come in contact with tournament directors and receive invitations to participate.

There he proposed a change of the Davis Cup Americas Zone rules. Up to that point the Americas Zone rules required that all finals be played within the confines of the North American section, forcing all South American teams to travel to the USA, Mexico or Canada to compete. The proposal, which was passed by an overwhelming majority and against the wishes of Australia, the USA and Great Britain, specified that the finals would be played on alternate home and away locations (a rule which was common to the rest of the world). Beginning in 1966 the finals of the Americas Zone were played under the revised rule, which may have resulted in the USA losing on red clay in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1966 and in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1967. After sustaining a severe hamstring injury in Cura√ßao in March 1967 he was forced to quit the tour. Staying behind while the other players moved on to Caracas, he later traveled to Mexico City, the second-to- last stop on the Caribbean circuit, to say goodbye to his friends and colleagues. Coaching career After leaving the tour in 1967 Wegner traveled to Los Angeles and arranged tournaments in the Caribbean and Latin America for George MacCall, then USA Davis Cup Captain and Owner of the National Tennis League (NTL), which had 6 players and 2 alternates under contract: Laver, Emerson, Rosewall, Stolle, Gimeno, Gonzales, and Segura and Olmedo. Also during this time Wegner met with another tour player, Mike Davies, Tour Director for Lamar Hunt's World Championship Tennis (WCT), which represented The Handsome Eight and discussed the advantages of both groups playing tournaments together. Hunt would later purchase the NTL from George MacCall. In 1968 after recovering from his injury Wegner took a position at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club as Assistant Coach to Pancho Segura. Because Pancho liked Oscar's emerging teaching style he permitted Oscar to coach many of his celebrity clients, including Dinah Shore's son Jody, Charlton Heston, Anne Douglas, Barbara Marx, Ava Gardner, Dean Martin Jr. and the children of Robert Taylor, Terrance and Tessa. During this period Wegner tested and developed a revolutionary new way of teaching tennis that he would later name Modern Tennis Methodology‚Ñ¢. In the Summer of 1969 Wegner taught at the Westside Tennis Club, home of the USLTA National Championship (now the US Open) in Forest Hills, NY as Assistant Coach to :fr:Warren Woodcock. Next Wegner moved to Florida where he worked as Assistant Coach at David Park Tennis Center in Hollywood, Florida. In 1970 he took the position of Head Tennis Coach for the City of West Palm Beach. In 1971 he went to Le Club International in Fort Lauderdale, Florida as Head Pro. In 1972 Wegner left Florida for Spain and became Director for Junior Development at Real Club de Tenis de Santander. The following year he was hired as the Junior Davis Captain for Spain and one of three National Coaches in Barcelona for the Escuela Nacional de Tenis at the Real Club de Polo then the Club de Tenis Andres Gimeno. While there Wegner persuaded the national coaching team including Joaquin Moure that reinforcing open stance and topspin was the best way to develop their juniors into players of international stature. According to Bud Collins, who met Oscar Wegner in 1973 in Miami Beach where he was coaching the Spanish Junior boys team in the worldwide Sunshine Cup tournament: \\"Those kids were hitting extra hard and with plenty of topspin in a way that startled spectators ‚Äì and me.\\"You Can Play Better Tennis In 2 Hours p.XII In 1974 he left Spain to take the position of Head Pro at the Aventura Country Club in North Miami Beach. That winter he served as the Tennis Pro at the Marco Polo Hotel in Palm Beach. He decided to build his own club, The Tennis Club International in Fort Lauderdale in 1975. After 3 years he sold his club and for the next 2 years he taught tennis, sailing and windsurfing at the Galt Ocean Mile Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, then, in the Winter of 1981 became Director of the Junior Academy at the Laver Racquet Club in Del Ray Beach, where he met Carlos Alves, and J√ºrgen Fassbender. In 1982 Alves invited him to Florian√≥polis, Brazil where Wegner spent a month working with a group of young players, including Gustavo Kuerten, then 5 years old, prior to going to Germany for the summer to coach at the Weiden Tennis Club in Cologne at Fassbender's invitation. Fassbender later wrote: \\"Oscar's techniques are incredible. He was with me in Germany and the students started to call him the 'American who could teach tennis in two hours'. Over and over, he had total beginners that would rally 40, 60 balls back and forth in just two hours of instruction.

He also helped them with their games during their visits to US tournaments including the Orange Bowl for the next several years, with the exception of Guga, who started working with Larri Passos from 1990 onwards. Wegner self-published his first book \\"Tennis in 2 Hours\\" in December 1989. Of its contents Martin Mulligan wrote: \\"This book is incredible! It describes to a \\"T\\" what I felt when I was at the top of my game. It is amazing that Oscar made it so simple to learn.\\"letter from Martin Mulligan to Oscar Wegner dated October 20, 1989 to verify permission to use on back cover of \\"Tennis In 2 Hours\\" TITH Publications (December 1989) During the Sunshine Cup, Wegner gave a copy of his new book \\"Tennis in 2 Hours\\" to Russian team captain Anatoly Lepyoshin,russia-ic.com Yevgeny Kafelnikov personally signed with the quote: \\"To the Russian Tennis Federation, with my best wishes, Oscar Wegner\\". The following year Bud Collins traveled to Moscow for the first Kremlin Cup and was asked by Russian coaches for more copies of Oscar Wegner's book. In the Fall of 1990 he returned to Boca Raton private- coaching players including Vince Spadea and his sisters Luanne and Diana at St. Andrews School, where Luanne is currently on the Alumni Association board of directors (he had previously coached them at the Laver Racquet Club when they first started playing, instructing their parents on how to coach them with his techniques). In January of that year Wegner coached Bj√∂rn Borg for a month at The Colony and the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Sarasota and Bradenton, Florida. Of the experience Borg wrote: \\"Oscar is a great coach.

He worked as Tennis Pro at the Newfield Bath and Tennis Club in Stamford, Connecticut during the Summer of 1993. TV, Sportscasting and Other Media From November 1991 through October 1995 Wegner was featured on the instructional segment of The New Tennis Magazine Show (renamed \\"Tennis Television With Brad Holbrook\\" in 1993), exposing the differences between conventional tennis teaching methods and his own. The segments, shot in New York, Florida and Pennsylvania were shown nationally on Prime Network and aired in Florida on Sunshine Sports Network. During this time Venus and Serena Williams had moved from Compton, California to Florida where they trained under the supervision of their father Richard at the Macci Tennis Academy, then left Macci's to train exclusively with their father thereafter, achieving tremendous success, from singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles to reaching #3 and #4 in the world by the end of 1999. Mike Daley introduced Wegner to Richard Williams during a satellite tournament at the Patricio Apey Tennis Academy in the Miami Airport Marriott in January 1999, and according to Oscar: \\"He greeted me with a great smile and said 'Oscar, it is an honor to meet you. I used to watch your show. Your techniques made so much sense that I taped them and had my girls watch them every day'.\\".tennisteacher.com August 2005 A decade later in a BBC interview highlighting her newly released book \\"Serena Williams My Life Queen of the Court\\" Serena said of her father: \\"he taught us this new innovative game that had really never been seen before.\\"news.bbc.co.uk Sport ‚Äì Tennis \\"I'm No Natural\\" Monday, November 9, 2009 Biography.com reports that \\"With their signature style and play, Venus and Serena changed the look of their sport.\\"http://www.biography.com/articles/Serena-Williams-9532901 paragraph 7 From April 1994 to December 1999 Wegner, who speaks 5 languages, worked for ESPN International as a tennis commentator in Spanish for Davis Cup, ATP and WTA tournaments including the Australian Open and the French Open, and in 2000 he joined the :es:Panamerican Sports Network doing ATP and WTA tournaments including Wimbledon. Through these broadcasts Wegner became well known throughout South America. Also contributing to Wegner's worldwide recognition were 40 \\"Play Like The Pros With Oscar Wegner\\" Tennis Tips, instructional vignettes both in English and in Spanish, which were broadcast by ESPN International from June 1997 through September 1999 several times daily in more than 150 countries around the world, including airings during the Super Bowl, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup Finals and US Open Golf Tournaments, generating over two billion impressions on television worldwide. In 1992 segments of the Tennis Television shows were compiled into videotapes, which became available for purchase. In 1997 Wegner acquired the rights to the videos and initiated a website in order to sell the videos and introduce his tennis methodology to the public. He also made tips and articles as well as the second edition of his book available free of charge on the site. Over the past 14 years Wegner's website has had millions of visits. In 2005 Wegner published the third edition of his book and a new video, produced for the first time in DVD format. He has subsequently produced 5 more DVDs and offers the 5 original videos as \\"classic\\" DVDs. In 2007 Wegner formed his own coaching organization, which currently has over 400 members worldwide. Coaching System According to Bill Tilden: \\"The game of tennis is one great circle that never quite closes. Progress will not allow a complete return to the old style...the ground stroke game was the style of the past, just as it will be the style of the future; but the modern method of making ground strokes is a very different thing from the one used by the old-time stars.\\".The Art of Lawn Tennis\\" by Bill Tilden Chapter XI Oscar Wegner recognized early on in his coaching career that the way tennis was traditionally taught bore little resemblance to the way the pros played. Thanks to his keen eye and experience on the tour he was able to distinguish between the \\"modern\\" method as Tilden referred to it and the traditional techniques and so-called conventional wisdom of tennis instruction, and set out to devise a more effective approach. His system of teaching tennis is based on the premise that players at every age and ability level can and should use the same basic techniques employed by the top players in the game, hence his motto \\"Play Like The Pros\\".Front Cover \\"Play Better Tennis in 2 Hours\\" by Oscar Wegner McGraw-Hill 2005 The system is based on allowing the player to use instinct and natural movement together with fundamental techniques that emulate the best strokes of the all-time great players in tennis. These fundamentals include an emphasis on open stance, highly developed hand‚Äìeye coordination, impeccable timing characterized by waiting rather than early preparation of the stroke, and absence of self- conscious emphasis on footwork. The simplicity of the method is summed in the phrase \\"Find, Feel, Finish\\". Many of today's tennis teaching professionals, combining elements from the past with the term \\"modern tennis\\", mirror techniques which conform in part with the basic principles of Wegner's methodology. Some remain critical of Wegner's techniques, others have modified their viewpoints and still others now openly advocate his original tenets. A 2004 USPTA bulletin to tennis teaching professionals warned: \\"There is an undeniable thread between professional tennis and recreational tennis, and the most important link between the two is you, the tennis-teaching professional. You bridge the gap between the shots and techniques of the competitive player and recreational players of all levels. That's why tennis teachers must know how to teach shots like the swing volley and open-stance, loaded groundstrokes and several other shots that characterize modern tennis and why we've spent the past 15 months creating the USPTA Player Development Program.\\".USPTA Player Development Volume 1, No. September 1, 2004 p. 2 In a presentation at the 2008 USPTA World Conference Nick Bollettieri admitted that after over 30 years of teaching the closed stance he now advocates the open stance,\\"It Ain't Easy ‚Äì Building a Champion of Life\\" USPTA World Conference La Quinta, CA September 2008 a mainstay of Wegner's method for over 40 years. In the 2008 Quickstart tennis practice and play plans manual the forehand is illustrated with an open stance and finish over the shoulder and advises that \\"coaches who work with young players at the start of their tennis careers will recognize the importance of starting them off well and with success\\",Quickstart Tennis High Performance Coaches Resource USTA 2008 p. 11 while the 2009 USTA Quickstart teaching manual for parents and recreational coaches illustrates the forehand with a traditional closed-stance position with the racket finish toward the target.Quickstart Tennis A Guide for Parents and Recreational Coaches by Kirk Anderson and Anne Davis, USTA 2009 p. 52 In a 2010 article for Tennis Magazine Macci.usptapro.com/ Rick Macci listed verbatim as the biggest myths of tennis instruction three of the \\"common tennis misconceptions\\" from Wegner's 1989 book.\\"The 10 Biggest Instruction Myths\\" by Rick Macci, Tennis Magazine March 2010 Chronological age and publication dates of other practitioners of modern tennis coaching techniques will indicate where on the timeline they relate to Wegner's methodology. Wegner has written several articles for TennisOne, a leading tennis instructional site since 1996 \\"founded on the dream of bringing the best teaching pros around the world to everyone\\".TennisOne archives: \\"The Height Of The Ball\\", \\"Forehand, The Racket Forward\\", \\"The Modern Topspin Forehand\\", \\"Idiosyncrasies\\", \\"Playing Nature's Way: Instinct And Feel\\" by Oscar Wegner In an introduction to one of his articles the editors of TennisOne wrote: \\"A lot has been written about the modern forehand with its natural movements, open stance, windshield-wiper swing, and most importantly, tracking the ball and waiting before taking the racquet back. Much of this has been pioneered by Oscar Wegner, who has been teaching this method since 1968. Back then, this was very controversial, however, history has proved him right.\\"TennisOne Newsletter May 22, 2006 Although a 1991 review of his book \\"Tennis In 2 Hours\\" in Tennis magazine stated that Wegner: \\"advocates an outdated brand of tennis that over-relies on topspin\\"Miami Herald \\"Author's Promise: Tennis In 2 Hours\\" by Jim Martz 1991 top players such as Tilden, Kramer, Laver, Borg, Lendl, Bruguera, Kuerten, Muster, Sabatini, Sanchez-Vicario and Nadal demonstrate the timelessness and efficacy of huge topspin throughout the history of the sport. In a 1992 episode of his TV series Tennis Television With Brad Holbrook, the host referred to Oscar Wegner as \\"The Father of Modern Tennis\\", initiating a reference that has been widely used and debated over the years, particularly in the past decade. Holbrook, who was largely responsible for launching Wegner's career in the USA, is himself an avid tennis player and fan. Wegner denies that he \\"invented\\" modern tennis: \\"I didn't discover something new. It's the way the top players play. If you go back 60 years there are some players that were already playing this way.\\".Oscar Wegner's Modern Tennis Methodology \\"Ultimate Professional Coaching Techniques\\" In a more amusing vein Wegner has been compared to the little boy who sees through the folly of convention in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale: \\"YET even today tennis associations and coaching organisations still insist on wearing The Emperor's New Clothes and ignore Oscars advice. Just look at the British LTA who spend millions on trying to find the magic formula when it's sitting right under their noses ....\\"Modern Tennis International, \\"The Naked Truth About Tennis\\" playmoderntennis.com David Bailey tennis footwork and fitness coach at Sydney Academy Tennis and creator of The Bailey Method, summarizes Oscar Wegner's Modern Tennis Methodology as follows: \\"Oscar's teachings make a lot of sense especially because the ideas are based on years of research and careful observation of how the modern day professionals hit the ball\\"David Bailey, \\"Bailey's Blog\\" October 3, 2009 Referencing Wegner's influence on Russian tennis \\"Leading Russian Coach Tatiana Matokhniyuk, who mentored Nadia Petrova and Marcus Baghdatis as juniors said of Oscar's system, 'You won't find beginners improve this quickly with any other method. It is the only way to teach at all levels. It's how we do it in Russia; surely everyone teaches this way'.\\"Tennis Life UK Magazine July 2009 p. 24 \\"Modern Tennis: Maybe the Quickest Way to Learn to Play?\\" by Nigel Phillips Wegner considers his greatest accomplishment the dissemination of his tennis teaching technology to coaches over the past 40 years. In addition to hundreds of tennis teaching professionals, high school coaches and parents certified in his methodology numerous coaches worldwide have been influenced by Wegner including Angel Jimenez, Lorenzo Fargas, Carlos Alves, Richard Williams, Chan Srichaphan, Jasenko Palos, Scott Gilmore, Sheri Slobin, David Glackin, Tia Hall, Bob Ruzanic and Vincent Spadea Sr. Ron Waite, certified USPTR tennis instructor who has successfully coached several NCAA Division III teams, has trained with many of the game's leading instructors (including Wegner), and writes the \\"Turbo Tennis\\" column on tennisserver.com, refers often to Wegner's methodology saying: \\"Oscar is a most unconventional tennis teacher. Some doubt his methods and insights, but I would beg to differ. In many ways, I believe Oscar was the \\"forerunner\\" with respect to the modern game. His \\"unorthodox\\" doctrine has made him an outcast of sorts. But, his devotees will certainly support that he knows what he is doing. I am one. His unorthodox methods and techniques have in major measure become a new orthodoxy!\\".tennisserver.com Turbo Tennis \\"The Orthodoxy of Unorthodox Strokes\\" October 2008 During his introduction of Wegner at the 2011 USPTA Nor Cal Annual Convention Dick Gould remarked: \\"Sometimes you listen to things a little different from what you've done before and Oscar and I go back a number of years...get to know him a little bit...to talk to him. He is not afraid to test the barriers a little bit, he is not afraid to say, hey, you don't quite do it like this and to look at how the players are really really playing...the mark of a good teacher is someone who listens and evolves with the game and leads that evolution and you have that guy here today. First time I saw this my mouth dropped, my jaw dropped open, I go holy criminy!

He played club rugby for Llanelli, and in 1938 he was selected to tour South Africa with the British Isles team. Rugby career Jones began playing rugby as a schoolboy for his local county school, joining Llanelli Harlequins as a senior. By the 1932/33 season he was playing for first-class team Llanelli, ending that season as top try scorer for the club with 15.Hughes (1986) p.131 Jones was again highest try scorer for Llanelli in the following season, this time ending with 23 tries.Hughes (1986) p.133 In the 1934/35 season Jones continued to score regularly, but his 16 try tally was surpassed by fellow wing Bill Clement.Hughes (1986) p.136 The next season Jones regained his leading try scorer title with 20, and he also experienced his first international opposition as the touring New Zealand team came to Llanelli on 22 October 1935. Jones was selected to face the tourists, though failed to score in a game won 16-8 by New Zealand. During the 1936-37 season Jones was selected as senior team captain, and led the team to one of their most successful seasons scoring a record 699 points. Jones showed his commitment to Llanelli and the amateur game by refusing three approaches to join the professional Northern League, all offers rumoured to have involved a signing- on fee of ¬£400.Hughes (1986) p.139 In 1938, despite not being selected for his national team, he was chosen to tour South Africa as a part of Bernard Charles Hartley's British Isles team along with team-mate Clement. Clement had been a first choice selection, but Jones was a later choice following the withdrawal of Harlequins wing F.J.V. Ford.Hughes (1986) p.141 Despite playing in only 12 of the 24 matches of the tour, Jones finished as the tour's highest try scorer with ten, including the first British try against the South Africa team, in the third and final Test of the series. Twice in the tour he scored a hat- trick of tries, against the South Western Districts and then Rhodesia. During the 1938/39 season, Jones was selected for his one and only international cap. Chosen for the second match of the 1938 Home Nations Championship, Jones was one of three different wings chosen opposite Syd Williams. The first match of the tournament saw F.J.V. Ford win his one and only cap, but Jones replaced him for the encounter against Scotland. Despite an 11-3 win, Jones was himself replaced for the final match to Ireland by Chris Matthews. The 1939/40 season would be Jones' last before the outbreak of the Second World War. Only one match was played, before the Welsh Rugby Union declared the cessation of competitive rugby, against Felinfoel. Jones was Llanelli captain for the match.Hughes (1986) p.144 Jones ended his career with Llanelli as one of their highest try scorers, with a career total of 129, one of the few players to have scored over a hundred tries for the club.Hughes (1986) p.246 After the war, Jones continued his connection with rugby and Llanelli by becoming club Chairman from 1960 through to 1967 and then serving as club President from 1978 to 1981.Hughes (1986) p.257 It was in his role as Chairman, that in 1964 at the Annual General Meeting of the Welsh Rugby Union, that Jones made a key speech where he attacked both the WRU and Welsh clubs for neglecting coaching; instead 'concentrating too much on physical fitness and neglected... basic skills and tactics.Smith (1980) p.369 He went on to claim that Welsh rugby 'at international and club level had deteriorated and even international players lack the ability to handle the ball accurately...' Jones pleaded for the Welsh Coaching Committee to be reconstituted and that the WRU should consider appointing an official Rugby Coach with several assistants, lest the AGM of the WRU 'degenerate into a meeting of social, instead of rugby, clubs.'Smith (1980) p.370 In 1967, the WRU hired their first international coach, David Nash. A constant believer in the progress of rugby, in the 1964/65 Llanelli RFC annual meeting, he announced the need to create a 'seconds team' to bridge the gap between Youth and Senior teams.Hughes (1986) p.195 An Elvet Jones represented Wales in the Victory Internationals after the war, but he represented Cardiff and Neath.

According to Charles Angmor, one being the \\"simple plot with simple character\\" and the other being the \\"intricate plot and character\\". The third was identified as \\"a very simple plot and a very simple characterization, with a didactic moral twist\\". Konadu's works contained two or more of these strategies. Konadu started his own publishing company after the overthrow of Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah in 1966.

His most notable map is the portolan of 1439, containing the first depiction of the recently discovered Azores islands.  Life  Gabriel de Vallseca was born in Barcelona to a family of Jewish conversos. He is sometimes said to be the son of Haym ibn Risch (of the Cresques family), who, upon conversion, took the name Juan de Vallsecha.Novinsky (1990:68) Alternatively, he had Majorcan relatives through his mother or his wife.Ginard Bujosa, p.59. Also Encycl. of Majorca. By 1433, Vallseca had left Barcelona and was living in Palma, Majorca, where he soon made a name for himself as a master cartographer, instrument-maker and merchant. He lived in the parish of Santa Creu, in the marine and commercial district of the city. He married Floreta Mir√≥ and had two sons, Francesc and Joan, both of whom later had run-ins with the Spanish Inquisition for \\"judaizing\\", which suggests their father Gabriel may also have been a crypto-Jew. Vallseca wrote out his last will in the city of Majorca in 1467 and died shortly after.Families de jueus conversos mallorquines ennoblides a Sic√≠lia: Els Tarong√≠ i els Vallseca. P de Muntaner, Revista Lluc, mar√ß-abril 2006, p√†g. 21 i seg√ºents  Works  1447 portolan chart of Gabriel de Vallseca (BNF, Paris). There are three existing portolan charts signed by Gabriel Vallseca * Map of 1439, at the Museu Mar√≠tim de Barcelona (inv. 3236) - partial mappa mundi * Map of 1447, at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (R√©s.

Ge. D 3005) - fragments of the eastern Mediterranean Although his style conforms to the traditional Majorcan cartographic school, Vallseca incorporated some more contemporary innovations in cartography from Italy, Portugal and elsewhere, most notably from Francesco Beccario (e.g. the homogenization of the scale between the Mediterranean and Atlantic). Gabriel de Vallseca's charts retain some signature Majorcan decorative motifs, such as the wind rose, miniature humans, animals and plants, the Atlas Mountains shaped as a palm, the Alps as a chicken's foot, Bohemia as a horseshoe, the Danube as a chain, the Tagus as a shepherd's crook, the Red Sea colored red, and scattered notes and labels in the Catalan language.  1439 Map  1439 portolan chart of Gabriel de Vallseca (Museu Maritim, Barcelona) Vallseca's most famous map is the portolan of 1439, particularly for incorporating the very recent discoveries of the captains of the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator. Its depiction of the Atlantic Ocean stretches from Scandinavia down to the Rio de Oro and including the Atlantic islands of the Azores, Madeira and Canaries, as well as the imaginary islands of Thule, Brazil and Mam. The most notable is the depiction of the islands of the Azores (officially discovered in 1431 by Henry's captain Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral), which although incorrectly spaced, are accurately depicted for the first time as strung out from southeast to northwest. The 1439 map is signed Gabriell de Valsequa la feta en Malorcha, any MCCC.XXX.VIIII. According to a marginal note on the reverse side, this map was once owned by Amerigo Vespucci, who paid 80 gold ducats for it. (Questa ampia pella di geographia fue pagata da Amerigo Vespuci - LXXX ducati di oro di marco). It is conjectured Vespucci probably acquired it in Florence in the 1480s, and that he might have even have taken it on his 1497-1504 voyages to the New World. The 1439 Vallseca map was acquired in Florence by the Cardinal Antonio Despuig y Dameto sometime before 1785, and subsequently came into the possession of his heirs, the Majorcan Counts of Montenegro. The map suffered an accident in the winter of 1838/39, when the Count of Montenegro was in the process of showing it to his visitors, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and George Sand. A carelessly- placed inkwell tipped onto the map, causing irreparable blots and marring the legibility of some of the labels on the western part of the map.The accident is related in George Sand's Un hiver √† Majorque (1842, 1869 ed.: p.63). Most notably, the inkwell accident damaged Vallseca's crucial note pertaining to the discovery of the Azores. The current note reads as follows: The surname and part of the date are smudged. The earliest reading we have of this portion of the map is by a Majorcan named Pasqual in 1789 who jotted the surname down as \\"Guullen\\".Mees, p.70 It has since been read as Diego de Senille.g. Santarem, p.390. ('the Old' - a hopeful reading in the direction of Gon√ßalo Velho) and de Seville.g. d'Avenzac p.31, Mees,p.71; Beazley, p.lxxxvi or de Sunis,Proposed by Jos√© Gomez Imaz, director of the reproduction for the 1892 centenary (as quoted in Mees, p.71) Survis, Sinus, Simis, Sines. The date has been alternatively interpreted MCCCCXXVII (1427) or MCCCCXXXII (1432)1432 is preferred by Santarem, again allowing for Gon√ßalo Velho's discovery of 1431 or MCCCCXXXVII (1437). In 1943, historian Dami√£o Peres proposed Diogo de Silves and the date as 1427, which is now commonly cited in Portuguese sources.Dami√£o Peres (1943) Hist√≥ria dos Descobrimentos Portugueses, p.83. Vallseca names eight or nine islands of the Azores, which have been hard to read because of the ink accident. One 1841 reading (by the Visconde de Santarem) identifies the names of the eight islands as Ylla de Osels (Ucello, Santa Maria), Ylla de Frydols (S√£o Miguel), Ylla de l'Inferno (Terceira), Guatrilla (S√£o Jorge), de Sperta (Pico), Ylla de ....? (erased, Faial?) and (although not yet officially discovered) the more westerly Ylla de Corp-Marinos (Corvo) and Conigi (Flores) (these last two would only be officially discovered by Diogo de Teive in 1452; Vallseca apparently lifted these last two from the Catalan Atlas of 1375).Visconde de Santarem, note in 1841 edition of Zurara's Chronica, p.390. The correspondence with the modern Azores islands is due to Beazley's edition of the Chronicle p. lxxxvi Other readings decipher \\"deserta\\" (rather than de Sperta), \\"jlla bela\\" (instead of Guatrilla), illa aucells or jlha aurolls (instead of Osels/Uccello), faucols (instead of Frydols) and raio marnos or vegis marins (instead of Corp-Marinos).A.

During the Pythian festival, an Athenian named Hermochares saw Ctesylla dancing in front of the altar of Apollo and fell in love with her. He threw an apple at her feet on which the text of an oath by Artemis' name was carved; Ctesylla picked it up and read the text aloud, which automatically obliged her to marry Hermochares. She became upset about that, but when Hermochares came to her father and wooed her, Alcidamas consented and swore by the name of Apollo that he would marry Ctesylla to Hermochares. As soon as the festival was over, Alcidamas forgot his oath and was planning to give Ctesylla in marriage to another man. Hermochares rushed to the temple of Artemis where Ctesylla was performing the customary sacrifices. In accord with the goddess' will, Ctesylla fell in love with Hermochares at the first sight and ran off with him to Athens, where they got married. However, in retribution for Alcidamas having broken his oath, Ctesylla died in labour. During the funeral ceremony, a dove flew up from her death-bed, and the body of Ctesylla disappeared. Hermochares consulted an oracle about that and was advised to found a sanctuary dedicated to Ctesylla. He reported this to the people of Ceos; since then at Ioulis, sacrifices were offered to Aphrodite Ctesylla, whereas in the other parts of Ceos, Ctesylla was a surname of Artemis. The story of Ctesylla and Hermochares parallels that of Cydippe and Acontius.

Issues and practices related to childbirth in Sri Lanka are influenced by the sociocultural composition, political history and violence within the country. Background The island-nation of Sri Lanka. Physical environment Sri Lanka is a small island nation in the Indian Ocean, off the southeast coast of India. The island is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate that is divided into the northeast monsoon (December to March) and southwest monsoon (June to October). The terrain is mostly low, flat to rolling fertile plains. Highlands with deep valleys exist in the central- southern interior of the country. Nearly one-third of Sri Lanka's total land mass is covered by natural vegetation; however, much of it has been depleted due to intensive agricultural practices. History The Sinhalese, who likely migrated from India, are first people known to inhabit Sri Lanka. It is commonly believed that they arrived in the 5th century BC. Near 300 BC, there is evidence that Tamil people began to migrate from India to the island now known as Sri Lanka. The Portuguese discovered the island largely by accident in 1505 CE and established their first trading settlement in 1517. The Portuguese briefly controlled the coastal areas of the island, followed by the Dutch in the 17th century. With these colonizers came the introduction of Roman Catholic missionaries who sought to convert Sinhalese and Tamil people to Catholicism. By March 1815, the island was formally united under British rule Throughout the 19th century, the British brought Tamil workers from India to staff the growing number of rubber and tea plantations. The people of the island gained independence from the British in 1948 and formed the nation of Ceylon. The official name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972, when Buddhism was named the primary religion of the country. Throughout the late 20th century and into the 21st century, Sri Lanka remained a country wrought with turmoil and war. Increasing Sinhalese nationalism led to disenfranchisement of the Tamil minority. Beginning in 1983 and lasting nearly three decades, brutally violent armed conflicts took place between the separatist Tamil terrorist group, named Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and the Sinhalese dominant Sri Lankan government force. These years were characterized by civil unrest, violence, guerrilla attacks, acts of terrorism and conventional warfare. During the conflict, Northern and Eastern provinces served as primary battlefields. It is estimated that more than 60,000 people were killed in the conflict. A ceasefire was signed in 2002, but mostly ignored and officially rejected by the Sri Lankan government in 2008 due to the continued attacks on civilians by the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government declared victory over the LTTE in May 2009 with the death of the LTTE's leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran.Goodhand, J. (2010). Stabilising a victor's peace? humanitarian action and reconstruction in eastern Sri Lanka. Disasters, 34, S342-S367. Religion Religion is a vibrant part of Sri Lankan culture. The predominant religions are Buddhism, Hindu, Muslim and Christianity. Buddhism was introduced sometime between 250-210 BC, and became the official religion of Sri Lanka in 1972. The 1978 constitution grants primacy to Buddhism, while also ensuring freedom of religion for all citizens. Throughout Sri Lanka's long history, Buddhism has remained an active part of the culture. Nearly 70% of the population is Buddhist. Due to the extensive conflict and war in the northern and eastern provinces, data regarding religious affiliation is variable. The national census states that 8% of the population identified as Muslim, 7% as Hindu, 6% as Christian, and the remaining 10% were unspecified.Department of Census and Statistics, in collaboration with Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Welfare. (2002). Sri Lanka demographic and health survey 2000. Pitakotte, Sri Lanka: State Printing Corporation The majority of Sri Lankan Muslims practice Sunni Islam. Sizable minorities of both Sinhalese and Tamils identify as Christians, most of whom are Roman Catholic. Political system Coat of arms of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is governed within the framework of a presidential representative democratic republic. In this multi-party system the president is the head of state, head of government and the commander of the armed forces. The long- standing conflict between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority is apparent within the political structure. The president is a member of the socialist capitalist Sri Lanka Freedom Party . The party was founded in 1951, and generally represents the interests of the nationalist Sinhala parties. The current Prime Minister is a member of the conservative United National Party. In 1959, Sri Lanka was led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world's first female chief executive. Mahinda Rajapaksa became president in 2005 and was re-elected in January, 2010, two years before the end of his term. as now he is the leader of the primary opposition party that the socialist capitalist United People's Freedom Alliance. Economic system Sri Lanka's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is US$4,900 with an annual growth rate estimated at 8%. The average annual income is US$964 Kaiser Family Foundation, Global Health Facts. (2010). Country Data Source: Sri Lanka. Retrieved from http://www.globalhealthfacts.org/country.jsp?c=199 and about 6% of the population lives below US$1 per day. In 2001, the country faced bankruptcy when national debt overtook GDP. Crisis was averted when the government gathered international loans after a ceasefire was signed with the LTTE. In 2009, a third of Sri Lankans worked in agriculture, a fourth in industry and the remainder primarily worked in services jobs. Four percent of males are unemployed. Women are becoming increasingly active in the job market and female unemployment has dropped from 22% in 1993, to 8% in 2009. The primary economic sectors include tourism, textiles, clothing manufacture, agricultural products and exportation of tea, apparel, gemstones and rubber. Social structure and organization In Sri Lanka, there has not been a comprehensive national population census completed since 1981. The 2001 national census did not include vital information from conflict areas of the northern and eastern parts of the country. Due to the ongoing violence in Sri Lanka, most demographic data available is estimated based on 1981 or 2001 data, and variation exists among data sources. The CIA World Factbook lists Sri Lanka's current population as 20,653,913 persons. Considering the island is only , it is a very densely populated nation. Over 85% of the population live in non- urban environments. The largest city is Colombo, with a population of 1,819,777. Sri Lanka is occupied by several ethnic groups. The Sinhalese are the predominant ethnic group (74%), followed by Sri Lankan Tamils (13%), Indian Tamils (5%) and Moors (Muslim) (7%).Rannan-Eliya, R. P. and Sikurajapathy, L. (2008). Sri Lanka: \\"Good Practice\\" in Expanding Health Coverage. In World Bank (311-354) Sinhala is the national language and is the predominant language spoken by 74% of the population. Most Tamils and Moors speak Tamil, part of the South Indian linguistic group. Due to the extensive conflict between Sri Lankan government and Tamil separatists that took place in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several hundred thousand Tamil citizens fled their homes in conflict zones and were placed in government run camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs), or sought refuge in other countries.Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, First Session, December 7, 2009 The total number of displaced persons is unknown, though in 1994 it was estimated over 500,000 people were displaced internally and more than 200,000 people fled internationally.Chandrakanthan, A. J. V. (1994). An exodus sans destination: Refugees and the internally displaced in Sri Lanka. Paper presented at the 4th International Research and Advisory Panel Conference, University of Oxford, Oxford, England Since 2009, considerable effort has been made to relocate the hundreds of thousand IDPs from government camps. When forced to flee conflict zones, most IDPs left behind their homes, assets, and tools necessary for their livelihoods. The Sri Lankan government reported that rations were provided for families selected for resettlement from IDP camps. These rations included agricultural tool kits, dry rations, an initial payment of Rs. 5,000 (est. US$44), a shelter grant of Rs. 25,000 (est. US$219), roofing sheets, provision of rice seed, fertilizer and transportation. Even in resettled communities, many people continue to face insecurity and poverty.Amirthalingam, K. and Lakshman , R.W. (2009). Displaced livelihoods in Sri Lanka: an economic analysis. Journal of Refugee Studies, 22(4), 502-524. As of February 2011, nearly 17,500 people continue to live at Menik Farm, Sri Lanka's largest camp for IDPs. Recent reports claim that the government hopes to resettle all conflict-displaced people by the end of 2011.Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), Asia. (2011). Sri Lanka: displaced to be resettled by end 2011 Retrieved from http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=91888 Rebuilding infrastructure in northern and eastern provinces affected by war is an ongoing task. Education Sri Lanka's education system is state funded, and offered free of charge at all levels, including the university level. Schooling is compulsory for children from 5 to 13 years of age. The national literacy rate is 91%. The reported literacy rate of the urban population is 93%, 92% of the rural population and 75% of the estate population. The literacy rate among women is 89%. Nearly 70% of the population is educated beyond the 9th grade. Health Information Considering the low annual income and many years of internal conflict, Sri Lanka's health indicators are stronger than those of many other developing countries. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Global Health Database, 90% of Sri Lankans have access to water and 91% have access to sanitation. An estimated 2,800 people are living with HIV/AIDS, and 20,000 are living with tuberculosis. The life expectancy at birth is 74 years of age. Health services are provided to Sri Lankan citizens free of charge and over 93% of the population has access to basic health care. The national prevalence of anemia among school children is about 12%.Pathmeswaran, A., Jayatissa, R., Samarasinghe, S., Fernando, A., de Silva, R., Thattil, R., and de Silva, N. (2010). Health status of primary schoolchildren in Sri Lanka. Ceylon Medical Journal, 50(2), 46-50. About one third of Sri Lankan children are undernourished (BMI-for age below the 5th percentile for age and sex). Children in the northern and eastern provinces have a much higher proportion of health problems when compared to children living in other provinces. Sri Lanka has an extensive network of health care institutions. The health system consists of both the state and private sector. State health services include preventative, curative and rehabilitative health services. Health services are organized and delivered through the Department of Health Services and the Provincial Health Sector. The Sri Lankan health system incorporates Western, Ayurvedic and Homeopathic medicine. The Ministry of Health oversees national health services.Fernando, D., Jayatilleka, A., and Karunaratna, V. (2003). Pregnancy‚Äîreducing maternal deaths and disability in Sri Lanka: National strategies. British Medical Bulletin, 67(1), 85-98. Eight Provincial Directors of Health Services are responsible for the management and implementation of health services within each province. These services include provincial, base, district and rural hospitals, maternity homes and outpatient facilities. Each province is divided into geographical areas, with a defined population, who are served by a Medical Officers of Health (MOH). Within each MOH area, a team of field level health workers, including Public Health Nurses (PHN), Public Health Inspector (PHI) and Public Health Midwives (PHM), work with a Medical Officer to deliver health care services at a community level. The PHM are responsible for delivering antenatal, natal and postnatal services in hospitals, community health centers and in patient's homes. Several different types of health care facilities exist and patients may choose where they receive services. Sri Lanka's achievements in maternal health and family planning are perceived as a success. In the 1930s, Sri Lanka's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 2,000 deaths per 100,000 live births.Prata, N., Passano, P., Sreenivas, A. and Gerdts, C.E. (2010). Maternal mortality in developing countries: challenges in scaling-up priority interventions. Women‚Äôs Health, 6(2), 311-327. Recognizing this as a national problem, the government implemented programs to improve infrastructure, education, sanitation and health systems in poor and under-served areas. Simultaneously, there was an improvement in maternal health services and extensive training of, and improved community access to, Public Health Nurse-Midwives. Maternal care now encompasses antenatal care, intrapartum and postnatal care. These strategies enabled Sri Lanka to reduce the MMR by half every 6‚Äì12 years between 1930 and 1995. In 2002, the MMR was 43 per 100,000 live births.Family Health Bureau (2007). Annual Report on Family Health Sri Lanka, 2004-2005, Ministry of Health Sri Lanka Publication, Colombo, Sri Lanka The estimated total fertility rate is 2.2 births per woman and population growth rate is 0.93%. The infant mortality rate was 11.2 per 1000 live births in 2003. The contraceptive prevalence rate was 70%; the infant mortality rate was 10.2 for female infants and 12.9 for male infants per 1,000 live births. In 1927, the midwifery services in the Colombo municipality were re-organized to include training of all midwives working in the municipality. Since then, PHM training has continued expand and follow a standardized course. By 1958, about 58% of the births were attended by a skilled birth attendant, of which 25% were deliveries in the home by a PHM. Since the 1950s the number of institutional (maternity home or hospital) deliveries has continued to increase, and in 2001, 92% of all deliveries took place in institutions. Effect of conflict on maternal health Many years of ethnic conflict have led to separation between the various ethnic and religious groups who inhabit Sri Lanka. Women in living in the conflict zones of northern and eastern Sri Lanka experience worse maternal outcomes compared to national averages.World Health Organization (2002) Health system and health needs of the north-east Sri Lanka. Colombo, Sri Lanka: Vishva Lekha Research conducted in the areas found significantly higher levels of poverty in conflict zones. On a national level, the proportion of the population living in poverty was 22.7%, but in the district of Amapara, nearly 65% of the population was living in poverty in 2002.Kottegoda, S., Samuel, K., & Emmanuel, S. (2008). Reproductive health concerns in six conflict-affected areas of Sri Lanka. Reproductive Health Matters, 16(31), 75-82. Young people living in conflict areas have higher rates of school drop-out, marry earlier and become pregnant earlier than young people in other parts of the country. Women in these areas face especially poor health outcomes These women are also subject to higher rates of domestic violence and many women report that their husbands force them to have sexual intercourse. Women in these areas have reduced access to contraception, and this may increase pregnancies in conflict zones. The total rate of fertility in conflict zones is 2.6 live births per woman while the national average is 2.2 live births per woman. Lack of basic health infrastructure combined with shortages of health professionals has severely limited reproductive health services in the northern and eastern provinces. They have extremely limited access to emergency obstetric care, increased rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, and higher rates of low birth weight babies. While the national rates of home birth are very low, one out of five women in conflict areas birth at home. In some districts, such as Batticaloa, as many as 41% of women give birth at home. Primary reasons for home births are: destruction of health centers, danger of travel, lack of transportation and poverty. The national PHM program virtually eliminated traditional birth attendants in Sri Lanka, but when women are forced to birth at home they may have the assistance of a traditional medicine woman, known as Marauthuvivhvhi. These birth attendants use home remedies, such as powders, herbs, oils and an herbal drink called perunkayam to support the woman through birth. These factors increase the risk involved with childbirth and highlight the needs of women living in the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. Marriage Unlike other Asian countries, Sri Lankan women have had equal access to education for many years and men and women enjoy similar rates of literacy. In other countries women's increased access to education and increased presence in the workforce has delayed the age of marriage, but these factors are less influential in Sri Lanka.Malhortra, A, and Tsui, A.O. (1996). Marriage timing in Sri Lanka: The role of modern norms and ideas. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 58, 476-490 Typically, Sri Lankans marry later than people in other Asian countries. In 1961, the average age of marriage was 22 years old, and today the average age of marriage is 25 years old in Sri Lanka. Muslim women marry earlier than Sinhalese and Tamil women. School attendance is believed to delay the age of marriage because women in school are not considered adults and are not ready for marriage. Birth order also influences age of marriage. Women with unmarried older sisters tend to marry later because of the tradition that women should marry in their birth order. Women who have arranged marriages typically marry later than those who choose their own husbands. Infertility Infertility is a deeply distressing issue among Sri Lankan couples. In the Sinhalese culture, birth is the sign of a successful marriage and rituals are performed if a woman does not conceive during the early years of marriage.Paranavitana, R. (2008). Some customs and superstitions associated with the childbirth in Sri Lankan Sinhalese society. Research Journal of Folkloristics, 1(1), 35-39 Often the couple and family members will make vows at a religious shrine and seek blessings from monks to help with conception. When a woman has a difficult time becoming pregnant, some people believe it is caused by misdeeds that took place in a previous lifetime. Performing virtuous deeds in the present life can help neutralize these deeds. Examples of beneficial acts include giving money to monks, beggars or children in need, lighting lamps or bathing the foot of a sacred Bo-tree with water or milk. A cultural issue arises when considering sperm donation among Buddhists. While donation of blood or body products are considered virtuous giving of one's self, semen is a very different matter.Simpson, B. (2004). Impossible gifts: bodies, Buddhism and bioethics in contemporary Sri Lanka. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 10(4), 839-859. In Aruvedic medicine, semen is \\"considered the highest of substances\\" and \\"loss of such a powerful substance is widely held to have a number of consequences such as anxiety, mental impairment, and impotence.Simpson, B. (2004). p. 553 Some physicians expressed concerns about the risk of potential mix-ups of sperm in in-vitro fertilization, fearing \\"children with such origins might experience a deep and troubling sense of strangeness towards a father who is not biologically related whilst expressing a desire to establish the genitor's real identity.\\". Because sperm donation involves ejaculation, which has origins in \\"physical pleasure for which there can be no justification in Buddhism,\\" acquiring donor sperm is often a difficult task. Monetary incentives cannot be used because the purchase of human tissue, including gametes, is illegal ). Pregnancy=Ideas regarding pregnancy Even though the government has actively encouraged family planning, Sri Lankans still regard pregnancy as a blessing and birth is a symbol of a successful marriage.Wanasundera, N.P. (2002). Cultures of the world: Sri Lanka. New York: Marshall Cavendish Reference Books Pregnancy outside of marriage is very rare in Sri Lanka.Olsson, P. and Wijewarena, K. (2010). Unmarried women‚Äôs decisions on pregnancy termination: Qualitative interviews in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, 1, 135-141. Culturally it is important that a woman remains a virgin until marriage. Single mothers do not receive government-based aid. Children born to unwed mothers are often labeled as illegitimate and considered outcasts in society. Preparation for birth When husbands learn their wife is pregnant, they make a vow to perform the Ratrayakuma ritual. This ritual, which involves hanging a pot containing coins, a betel leaf and flowers from the rafters, is done to appease the evil spirit Rata Yaka, who is believed to prevent successful child bearing and delivery. During a first pregnancy, couples often visit temples of special significance in the Buddhist faith. Examples of such temples are Temple of the Tooth in Kandy or the Sacred Bodhi tree at Anuradhapura. At the temple they pray for the pregnancy and ask for an uncomplicated birth and healthy life. They make vows to ensure their wishes are granted. If their wishes are granted, they return to the temple or shrine to make offerings of praise to the Gods who protected their newborn child and mother during pregnancy and birth. During pregnancy, family members take care to please the pregnant mother and protect her, and her unborn child, by relieving her of household duties. The pregnant woman's mother, grandmother or mother-in-law supervises meals. While pregnant, women may experience Doladuka, or suffering of two hearts. This experience includes unusual desires to eat particularly sour fruits or indulge in specific acts. These wishes must be fulfilled to protect the fetus from physical or mental defects. Pregnant women avoid eating twinned foods as they are thought to lead to the birth of twins. Relatives and friends visit often to give gifts of fruits and boiled rice with curry wrapped in a banana leaf. Traditionally, baby showers are considered bad luck and gifts are not given until after the birth of the child. When preparing clothing for the new baby, care is taken to never complete the garment before the birth of the baby, as this assumes the birth is a certainty. In the last three months of pregnancy, it is typical for women move their parents‚Äô home and stay a few weeks after the delivery to recover and receive care.De Silva, W.I. (1998). Puerperal morbidity: A neglected area of maternal health in Sri Lanka. Biodemography and Social Biology, 45(3), 223-245 This practice is especially common among first time mothers. During this time, Buddhist monks are invited to the home to chant blessings and expel evil spirits who might harm the woman and fetus. Prenatal care The PHM provides prenatal care to women at home visits and in health clinics. These visits include blood pressure screening, measurement of weight and education related to nutritional needs during pregnancy.De Silva, W.I. and Ban, D.J. (2001). Biomedical facts and social constructs: the relative attention paid to prenatal and postpartum periods in Sri Lanka. Asia- Pacific Population Journal, 16(2), 45-62 A PHM registers all pregnant women, and most are registered in the first trimester of pregnancy. Nearly every pregnant woman (98.5%) receives antenatal care. According to Demographic and Health Survey 2000, 95% of women visited a clinic at least once during pregnancy and 84% had a midwife visit her home. Most women receive six or more home visits by the PHM during pregnancy. Only a very small percent of pregnant women receive fewer than three visits by a PHM. Women typically receive one visit during the first trimester, then two to three visits additional during each of the second and third trimesters. Extrinsic factors Currently little information exists regarding extrinsic factors that may affect pregnancy, such as air, water, food and drink. This is an area for additional research. Birth=Location and type of delivery Skilled birth attendants attend more than 97% of births In Sri Lanka. Nearly all births (99%) take place in a hospital or maternity home and are assisted by a physician or PHM. All first pregnancies and high-risk pregnancies are referred to a health facility staffed by an obstetrician. Most women give birth vaginally, but the incidence of cesarean section, or C-section, is rising. In 1986, the rate of C-section was 9% and by 1999, the rate rose to 14.4% of births in government hospitals.Fernando, L. and Abeywardena, M. (1999). Trends in caesarean section. Sri Lanka Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 16, 14-20 Currently, 66% of births are spontaneous vaginal deliveries, 4% are operative vaginal deliveries and 30% are by C-section.Lumbiganon, P., Laopaiboon, M., G√ºlmezoglu, A. M., Souza, J. P., Taneepanichskul, S., Ruyan, P., ‚Ä¶Villar, J. (2010). Method of delivery and pregnancy outcomes in Asia: The WHO global survey on maternal and perinatal health 2007‚Äì08. The Lancet, 375(9713), 490-499. It is hypothesized that the increase in C-sections is due to a variety of factors, including increased use of epidural anesthesia and fetal monitoring.Gunasekera, P.C., Wijesinghe, P.S. and Goonewardene, I.M. (2001). The caesarean rate is rising Use of technology Little information is known about actual practices in Sri Lanka, but the Sri Lankan College of Obstetric Gynecology (SLCOG) publishes national guidelines for management of certain conditions of pregnancy. Uncomplicated labor SLCOG defines normal labor as \\"spontaneous onset, low-risk at the start and remaining low risk throughout the process\\".Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SLCOG).

While routine enemas are not recommended, SLCOG does emphasize that \\"efforts must be make to minimize fecal soiling‚Ä¶to overcome the practical difficulties associated with cleaning and maintaining sterility\\".Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SLCOG).

Retrieved from http://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2010/national-guidelines/pdf/Management- Uncomplicated-Labour-SLCOG.pdf Low risk women are allowed to consume clear fluids during early labor, but must consult an anesthesiologist first. SLCOG recommends that maternal preference be honored when considering mobility and posture during labor. The organization recommends standing and lateral recumbent positioning to minimize reductions in uterine blood supply and reductions in cardiac output. Intermittent fetal heart auscultation and observation of vaginal discharge is used to assess the fetal condition. A partogram is recommended to facilitate monitoring during labor. During the second stage of labor, women are encouraged to assume the most comfortable position. In the second stage of labor fetal heart rate should be assessed every 15 minutes and the fetal heart rate should be assessed after each contraction while bearing down. Active management of labor with oxytocin is recommended in the third stage of labor. Medio-lateral episiotomies are recommended to expedite delivery or prevent perineal injury. Once the neonate is delivered, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, controlled cord traction should be applied. It is recommended that the placenta, membranes and umbilical cord are examined for abnormalities after delivery. After delivery, women should be monitored for complication for two hours in the labor suite. Premature rupture of membranes Management of preterm rupture of membranes involves either expectant or active management.Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SLCOG).(2010). National guidelines: Management of premature rupture of membranes. Retrieved from http://www.gfmer.ch/SRH-Course-2010/national-guidelines/pdf/Management-PROM- SLCOG.pdf The classification depends on maturity of the fetus, neonatal facilities available at the place of birth, presence of infection and fetal distress. Expectant management involves general observation of vital signs and fetal observations, including kick count, presentation, daily electronic fetal monitoring and weekly ultrasound. Active management beyond 32 weeks gestational age involves administration of corticosteroids, antibiotics and awaiting active labor. If active labor does not begin within 24 hours, delivery is advised. Pain management in labor Generally, Sri Lankan women prefer to give birth without pharmacologic pain management. SLCOG recommends that birthing women be provided with adequate analgesia and the selection of pain relief is determined by institutional protocols, drug availability and patient preference. Pethidine is the most common drug used for pain management during labor, especially in maternity units where clinicians with advanced medical training and monitoring facilities may not be present.Warnakulasuriya, A. (2010). Obstetric anaesthesia. Sri Lankan Journal of Anaesthesiology, 18(1), 5-9. During C-sections, 80% of women receive spinal anesthesia, 15% epidural and 5% general anesthesia. Non-pharmacologic pain management includes breathing techniques, hot and cold therapy, massage, relaxation techniques, acupuncture, herbalism and hypnosis. Women often recite pirith to control breathing during labor. This is a chant performed by monks during pregnancy to ensure safe delivery. Extrinsic factors Currently little information exists regarding extrinsic factors that affect birth, such as air, water, food and drink. This is an area for additional research. Registration of Birth Every birth should be registered with the government to obtain a birth certificate which act as the main legal document for a citizen in Sri Lanka. The name of the child (which is given by the parent), details of the mother and the father will be entered in the birth certificate. The birth certificate will be required to obtain the National Identity Card, Passport and many more legal activities. An application form should be obtained from Divisional Secretariat and proceed with the registration. Birth traditions The specific date and time of birth are carefully recorded to determine a child's horoscope. The time of birth determines the zodiac sign, and also specific character traits of the child. The horoscope is significant throughout the lifecycle. It is read by an astrologer at birth, puberty, prior to an examination or new job, when determining if a potential spouse is a good match, or for any other important decision. Postpartum The postpartum time is not clearly defined; however the puerperium period is defined as the first six weeks in the postpartum period. Most women who deliver vaginally spend one night in a health institution, while about 5% return home the day of delivery. Women who deliver by C-section typically spend seven nights in the health institution before returning home. Sri Lanka does not have a system to record maternal morbidity, but research suggests maternal morbidity is an area of concern among Sri Lankan mothers. Sri Lankan mothers generally feel that it is natural to experience ill health after childbirth. About 90% of women who deliver vaginally and 75% women who deliver by C-section report illness in the puerperium period. Examples of these illnesses include excessive bleeding, fever, constipation, breast engorgement, painful urination, backache and abdominal pain. Buddhist mothers have the highest incidence of illness while Muslim mothers had the fewest poor health outcomes after birth. Newborn Rites of Passage Newborn rites of passage vary among ethnic group. Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim families publicly announce the birth of a child as a gesture of accepting the newborn as a member of the family.Mills, M., Claus, P. and Diamond, S. (Eds.). (2003). South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. New York, NY: Routledge This may be a casual or grand celebration and often involves food, dancing and singing. Sinhalese The exact time of birth is reported to an astrologer who uses the child's horoscope to determine the best letters for the child's name. Nam tebima is the Sinhalese naming ceremony. The baby's first outing is typically to a Buddhist temple on a full moon day to receive blessings for a prosperous life. Idul kata gema is the ceremony to celebrate a baby's first solid food. The ceremony, which takes place either in the family home or in a temple, involves placing dishes of rice boiled with milk, traditional sweets, a banana, a book and a piece of jewelry. The family observes as the baby is allowed to crawl onto the mat and select an item. If the child chooses the food, he or she will have a healthy appetite for life, if the child chooses the book he or she will have a future in academia, and if the child chooses the jewelry he or she has a promise of fortune and success. Tamil The name-giving ceremony, Namakarana samskar, typically takes place 11‚Äì41 days after birth. During this ceremony the baby's father whispers the new name in the infant's right ear. It is typical to celebrate a baby's first consumption of solid food when a child receives his or her first taste of rice. The ceremony typically occurs in a kovil, or Hindu temple. The meal of boiled rice usually occurs between six and eight months of age. Other childhood rituals include the Chudakarana samskara, or head-shaving ceremony, which represents purity and removes all remnants of birth pollution. This event marks the end of infancy and the beginning of childhood. Karnavedhna Samskara is the name of the ear piercing ceremony that typically takes place either in a temple or at home on the first birthday. Muslim Muslim boys are circumcised between the ages of seven days and ten years. Some communities circumcise males as neonates, while others believe the child should be old enough to understand the significance of the event. Traditionally, a community member performed circumcisions in the boy's home, though some families now have the procedure done in a medical center. The celebration includes new clothes for the boy and a special meal prepared for family and friends. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is a culturally accepted and encouraged practice in Sri Lanka.Agampodi, S.B. and Agampodi, T.C. (2008). Effect of low cost public health staff training on exclusive breastfeeding. Indian Journal of Pediatrics, 75(11), 1115-1119. The rate of breastfeeding initiation is nearly 100%.Department of Census and Statistics, in collaboration with Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Welfare. (2003). Sri Lanka demographic and health survey 2002. Department of Census and Statistics. Sri Lanka: Colombo In Sri Lanka, public health officials recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child's life. PHM and medical officers of health provide pre-and post-natal counseling and education to support women in breastfeeding practices. In 2000, 54% of women breastfed exclusively for the first four months of life. Little data exists to determine rate of exclusive breastfeeding at six months of age, but it is believed that very few mothers breastfeed exclusively until their newborn reaches six months of age.Agampodi, S.B, Agampodi, T.C. and Piyaseeli, U.K. (2007). Breastfeeding practices in a public health field practice area in Sri Lanka: a survival analysis. International Breastfeeding Journal, 2(3). A study that integrated low cost staff training with job supervision of PHM showed a significant increase in exclusive breastfeeding among mothers in Beruwala, Sri Lanka. The authors believe that six months exclusive breastfeeding is a realistic goal in Sri Lanka and suggest a need to increase training and support for PHM in maternal health care settings. Circumcision No information exists on the current rates of male or female circumcision in Sri Lanka. Generally, these are not common procedures among Buddhist and Hindu populations. Male circumcision is practiced among Muslims and is traditionally an occasion for celebration. Contraception Contraception is widely used in Sri Lanka, though generally considered a women's issue. The country has a vasectomy rate of 3.7% East, M. (2002). Contraceptive Sterilization: Global Issues and Trends, EngenderHealth: 17-64. and many people believe vasectomy inhibits men from performing hard labor.De Silva, W.I. (1992). Do fertility intentions and behaviour influence sterilization in Sri Lanka? Asia Pacific Population Journal, 7(4), 41-60 In 1979, to increase the use of vasectomy in family planning, the Sri Lankan government began offering monetary incentives to men who agreed to undergo the procedure. Financial payment was the often primary reason for obtaining a vasectomy.Dias, L.R. and Dias, M.K. (1988). The motivating factors for vasectomy in Sri Lanka. Journal of Family Welfare, 34(4), 12-22 Many Sri Lankan couples discuss the need for contraception to limit family size and space pregnancies. More than two thirds of the married population use some form of contraception. Generally, husbands support the use of female contraception. In 1993, nearly one fourth of married women were sterilized, however the prevalence of female sterilization fell to 17% of ever-married women by 2007.Rodrigo, C. and Muhuthar, R. (2009). Acceptance of ligation and resection of tubes for contraception in Sri Lanka. Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care, 35, 266 Women feel it is important to use a method of contraception approved by their husbands. This information guides the need to educate both men and women about contraceptive options, use and side effects.

He was supporter of the Hussites and father of the Bohemian King George of Podƒõbrady.  Life  Victor was born into the noble Podƒõbrady family. His parents were Boƒçek II of Podƒõbrady and Anna Elisabeth of Leipa (), a daughter of Henry of Leipa (). He gave several of his sons the middle name of Boƒçek, a name which many of his ancestors had had. Victor was first mentioned in a document dated 1417 dealing with the inheritance of his father, who died in that year. Victor inherited the Bohemian lordships of N√°chod and Hummel, and Litice Castle, which became his headquarters and which was the reason he sometimes called himself Lord at Litice. He inherited his father's Moravian estates jointly with his older brother Boƒçek III of Podƒõbrady. His youngest brother Hynek inherited Podƒõbrady Castle and the associated estate. The eldest brother, John, died during his father's lifetime, sometime between 1407 and 1409. Victor and Boƒçek III fought several court cases about their Moravian possessions, among others with their distant relatives Gerald Pu≈°ka of Kun≈°t√°t and Smil of Kun≈°t√°t at Bludov. Around 1420, Victor acquired the dominion of Pardubice, which extended his eastern Bohemia possessions considerably. His brother Hynek died in 1426 during the battle of Nymburk. After Hynek's death, Victor inherited his dominion of Podƒõbrady, and also Mydlovar Castle, which Hynek had taken illegally in 1425. Like his brothers Victor supported the Hussites. In 1420 he participated in the siege of Vy≈°ehrad in part and joined the Orebites. Early in 1422 he approached Jan ≈Ωi≈æka, and became his supporter and friend. For this reason Litice was besieged in 1421 by the armies of the princes and catholic nobles who sided with emperorSigismund. After ≈Ωi≈æka's death, Victor lead the Sirotƒç√≠ for a while, but then he sided with the more moderate citizens of Prague. From his marriage with Anna of Wartenberg (; born: 1403; died: 1459), he had three children: * George (1420‚Äì1471), who became King of Bohemia in 1458 * Al≈æbƒõta (1422‚Äì1501), married Jind≈ôich z Dub√© a Lip√© * Mark√©ta (1425‚Äì1476), married Bohuslav ze ≈Ωeberka a Plan√© Victor died on 1 January 1427 at his Pardubice Castle.

A long-time educator and advocate of social justice, Freedman is known for leading the effort to have the American Psychiatric Association de- classify homosexuality as a mental illness. Early life and education Alfred Freedman was born January 7, 1917, in Albany, New York. After earning his undergraduate degree at Cornell University in 1937, Freedman graduated from the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1941. He began an internship at Harlem Hospital but left before completion to enlist in the United States Army Air Corps. He left the service having attained the rank of Major. After initially studying neuropsychology, Freedman trained in both general and child psychiatry, undertaking a residency at Bellevue Hospital. He became the chief of child psychiatry at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, a post in which he served for five years, before becoming the first person to serve full-time as the department of psychiatry Chairman at New York Medical College, a post which he held for 30 years. Removing homosexuality as a mental illness In 1972, Freedman was approached by the Committee of Concerned Psychiatrists, a group of young reform-minded doctors, who encouraged him to run for the presidency of the American Psychiatric Association. He won the election by 3 votes out of some 9,000 that were cast. In his position as president, Freedman immediately supported a resolution offered by Robert L. Spitzer to delete homosexuality from the list of mental illness diagnoses. On December 15, 1973, the APA's board of trustees voted 13‚Äî0 in favor of the resolution, which stated that \\"by itself, homosexuality does not meet the criteria for being a psychiatric disorder\\" and that \\"We will no longer insist on a label of sickness for individuals who insist that they are well and demonstrate no generalized impairment in social effectiveness.\\" LGBT rights organizations have hailed this decision as one of the greatest advances for gay equality in the United States. Freedman himself believed that passing this resolution was the most important accomplishment of his one-year tenure as president. A second resolution called for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and the repeal of laws against consensual gay sex. Other concerns Freedman was also concerned about the treatment of drug addiction. In 1959 he established in East Harlem one of the earliest drug treatment programs for adults and the following year created a similar program for adolescents. As president of the APA Freedman worked to draw attention to the abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He led a delegation to the USSR and challenged the practice of detaining political dissidents in mental facilities. Following his retirement he turned his attention to the role of psychiatry in capital punishment and campaigned for doctors not to participate in executions and against the administration of psychiatric medicines to death row inmates so they could be declared competent for execution. The Alfred M. Freedman Award for best scientific paper presented at the annual International Society of Political Psychology meeting was awarded from 1993 to 1999.Alfred M.

Career Stanojeviƒá finished university studies in Belgrade's Grandes √©coles and post-graduate studies in philosophy in Vienna, where he received his PhD in 1896. He was a student of Konstantin Jireƒçek, Vatroslav Jagiƒá and Karl Krumbacher, and a follower of Ilarion Ruvarac and his school of historiography. Stanojeviƒá belongs to the first generation of Serbian historians educated abroad, at European universities. In 1903, he became a professor of the Grande √©cole (University of Belgrade), his alma mater. During Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia in World War I, Stanojeviƒá escaped to Sankt Petersburg, where he taught at the university as a visiting professor. From 1917, he lectured at Sorbonne and at the University of London. After the war, in 1919, Stanojeviƒá resumed his chair as professor of National History at the University of Belgrade until 1937, the time of his death. He was a broadly cultured man of many interests, he had profound knowledge of history, knew Latin, Greek, Old Church Slavonic and major European languages. His basic orientation was mediaeval history of Serbia and the Serbian lands, primarily the early Middle Ages and the time of the Nemanja dynasty. He was one of the founders of the Byzantine studies in Serbia. Stanoje Stnaojeviƒá is the author of six hundred and sixteen works, and the most popular are Byzantium and the Serbs and The History of the Serbian People. Stanojeviƒá's interest in the relations between Serbia and the Byzantine empire, from the beginning of the 20th century, almost completely ceased in his later years, with the significant exception of his fruitful Serbian diplomatic studies, which also included the Byzantine component.

Formed in 1880, the congregation's first building was constructed by Philip Brown and several others in 1890. Charles Henry Wheeler (architect) designed the original Synagogue on King Street (1889‚Äì90).http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/352 Charles Henry Wheeler (architect) The synagogue has been located at 561 Wellington Crescent off Academy Road, on the western bank of the Assiniboine River, since 1950. History Before the synagogues came to be established by Jews in Canada, history of emigration to Canada, very much before World War I, is replete with the hardships faced due to migration from Russia and other countries and living under very trying conditions. The first settlers came to Canada much earlier in 1880. Canada was in need of immigrants and Jews from Russia and other countries fitted the bill. Initially the community established temporary synagogues in rented houses. However, the first congregation of Jews had begun in 1880 when a tiny group of Jewish migrants formed together. By 1891, the Jewish population of Winnipeg had grown to 645 persons, and 1156 persons by 1901, bringing about a demand in the city for synagogues to be built. The community bought a plot (at the corner of King and Common (now Henry) streets) to build a synagogue, in 1887 from William Gomez de Fonseca, at a cost of $1,250. The synagogue was built to the plans of Architect Charles H. Wheeler and by 1889 it was completed and named as ‚ÄúShaarey Zedek‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúthe Gates of Righteousness‚Äù It was consecrated on 20 March 1890. Its coloured windows and tabernacles were made of finest Italian and American marble. Additional land of 4 ha was purchased in 1894 to have an exclusive cemetery, named the Shaarey Zedek Cemetery, that serves the community to this day. The original Shaarey Zedek Synagogue was located on Henry Avenue and 315 King Street. Built in 1890, it was the first of many synagogue buildings erected in Winnipeg, built three years before Rosh Pina Synagogue on Henry Avenue. The principal members of the Bethel Synagogue established their own conservative synagogue in 1899 and called it the Shaarey Zedek. The synagogue premises had its own cemetery. A Hebrew school also functioned here for several years. In 1899, it was located on 37 Martha Street, and T. Finkelstein was its president. Rabbi Solomon Frank occupied the synagogue's pulpit from 1926 until 1947, following Rabbi Herbert J. Samuel. Frank was succeeded by Rabbi Milton Aron. In 1902, the first Canadian Talmud Torah was opened in a new building next to Shaarey Zedek Synagogue. In 1913, proposals to build a new the synagogue were put off. This was done to absorb a branch congregation which had earlier established its own synagogue at Shaarey Shomayim could not sustain itself due to financial difficulties. Following this merger the main older synagogue was expanded. However, a new building came to be established only in 1950. Aron became the first rabbi of the new synagogue which opened as 561 Wellington Crescent off Academy Road, near the Assiniboine River, in 1950. The synagogue has been used for meetings during important events in its history. In 1982, it was subject to a Conservative General-by-Law, amended in 1991. The NA has microfilmed records of Shaarey Zedek Synagogue, Winnipeg from 1889-1983, along with Holy Blossom Temple, Toronto from 1856-1969. The Shaarey Zedek Synagogue conforms to Conservative Judaism and claims to promote spiritual growth, continuing education and the enrichment of life cycle events of its community. Architecture The current building was built on Wellington Crescent throughout 1949 it opened in 1950. The building is a long, light grey stone complex, consisting of oblong architectural pieces, overlooking a lawn and the river. It more resembles a university campus or a government building than a synagogue. The synagogue is noted for its beautiful stained glass windows, designed by Leo Mol and documented by the Institute for stained glass in Canada. It has capacity to hold 1,500 members. The synagogue is located north of Munson Park, near the Maryland Bridge, Rehabilitation Centre for Children, Lutheran Church of the Redeemer and First Unitarian Universalist Church of Winnipeg, across the river from the Westgate Mennonite Collegiate and the Cornish Library.

The elected kings maintained the tradition and the royal secretary often had a great deal of power.Walewskiego, Antoniego (1868) Historya Wyzwolenia Polski za panowania Jana Kazmierza (1655-1660), Tom.

This determination is established by institutional aspects that regularized television for the majority of the country, including the color television standard option. Early television evolved from the network organization of radio in the early 1940s. The three networks that rose to dominance, NBC, CBS, and ABC, were nearly non-conglomerated corporations that were based in the business center of New York City. These networks were first established by radio and played a significant role in post war American identity. Because they had exclusive control of the market, there was no incentive for these corporations to take a financial risk in creating shows that catered to niche audiences. Conventions that defined the network era such as the television set, antenna and 30-second advertisements were not established immediately. Film studios and independent television producers had only three possible places to sell their media, so they were forced to comply with the practices established by the networks. Early television, like early radio, had only one advertiser that usually sponsored a single program. The networks eliminated that format and changed to multiple corporations purchasing commercials. In the 1950s the network era advertising style turned into a single sponsorship style (Situation in which a single corporation finances the costs that could have been earned if advertising were sold to sponsors. It also allows more cinematic television) with the corporations being more about selling a product rather than an image. With this change, the broadcast had more control over the network because they had a magazine style format for advertisers. The thirty second ads dominated during the network era. While initially the single sponsorship system worked, it soon became clear this advertising strategy {single sponsorship}could not afford to pay for the continuous production cost. Scandals also became an issue with this system and this only further contributed to the development of a new advertising model called the \\"participation format.\\" For all involved, except the viewers,the participation format proved to be a far more beneficial advertising format. Not only was this system more cost sufficient in the production of television, networks also began to have a broader blend of advertisers. Television viewers of the network era had very few choices and extremely limited technology. The viewers were receptive to the fact that there was limited programming choices. The viewers had to base their daily duties around the television schedule that the networks had mandated. Despite obvious setbacks, the television was cutting edge technology that created a huge demand for everyone in the United States to purchase one. By 1970 only 32 percent of homes had more than one television set in the United States. Television programming was strictly uniform and these basic characteristics contributed to the programming strategies used throughout the network era. Technology got better during the multichannel television era, in the network era the television sets didn't have color or a remote control. The television viewers had to watch TV in black and white and they had to get up and turn the station manually. A fundamental aspect of the network era was the limited ability of networks to reach viewers, which defined how the television is essence, was used. Distribution windows were numbered as a result of producers reselling original-run episodes to international markets, independent stations and broadcast affiliates to combat the costs of deficit financing. Networks selected programs that would reach a wide range of people, such as family sit-coms, cop shows and game shows. However, networks still directed their programs to the white middle class. The network era featured extremely limited program genres and people became accustomed to the way television was. As the arrival of new technologies emerged it offered television viewers more choice and control. This eventually ended the network era and forced us to move into the multi-channel transition. Television, however, was not just a technology but also a set of experiences and practices associated with viewing it. During the Network Era, television acted as a cultural institution. It communicated values and ideas within a culture. Distribution bottleneck During the Network Era, the limited number of distribution windows created the 'distribution bottleneck'. Producers only sold series either to networks or to local stations - that allowed only a limited amount of programming to get through to viewers. Without personal recording capabilities and few alternative ways to receive programming, viewers had hardly any opportunities to re-screen content and never on their own terms. In 1994, fibre networks shattered the distribution bottleneck. With the cost of adding content close to zero, network owners profit from programs that create any increase in use, however tiny. Niche programmers no longer needed to produce enough content to fill a channel all day long. Instead, they can put any amount of it on a server, from a single ballet to a hundred operas, and charge viewers as much as the market will bear. The 'big three' ABC, NBC, CBS struggled harder to hold on to advertisers, which shifted their spending towards targeted media, and to audiences. Research suggests that, however many channels there are, people watch only seven or so. But the more channels they have, the less likely it is that ABC, say, will be among the seven. As viewers were freed from the slavery of schedules, and as cable and telephone firms encroach on the distribution end of the TV business, the broadcast networks ended up standing or falling purely as content providers.http://www.Economist.com.(1994) \\"From prime time to my time\\".Vol. 330.

It lies on the northern slopes of the Gro√üer Winterberg in the Affensteine rocks. On the rock there was once a watchtower of the Barony of Wildenstein. Today the Frienstein is a popular climbing peak .  History  Around 1410 a watchtower was erected on the Frienstein as a signal station by the Barony of Wildenstein that was owned by the family of Berka z Dub√©. By this means it was possible for Frienstein to make contact with the surrounding watchtowers on the Winterstein, the Neuer Wildenstein and the Alter Wildenstein. In 1451 the Frienstein together with the rest of the barony went to the House of Wettin and thus to the Electorate of Saxony. In the period that followed, robber knights lodged on the Frienstein, even in 1479 one of their workers conceded that \\"item near Frienstein is a trap..., where those who are caught are tormented\\" (item beym Freynstein ist eyn loch ..., do man die gefangen eynfurt zu peynigen). On the first cartographic record in Saxony, a map dating to 1592 by Matthias Oeder, the rock is marked as Freystein. View from the Ida Grotto On the present-day climbing route called the Alter Weg (\\"Old Way\\") one can still see the rebates and steps cut out of the rock that were once used to climb it. Even on the summit area there are traces of the watchtower in the shape of rebates for anchoring a wooden observation post. On the eastern side at the foot of the rock is the Ida Grotto (Idagrotte), a large crevice and bedding cave, that is nowadays a popular destination. It can only be reached over a narrow band of rock. In the grotto there are still traces of its medieval use as a living area. Because of its size and the fact that it is easy to get to, the Ida Grotto is a popular goal for Boofers, a Saxon term for hikers who sleep out in the open. However, in recent years, there have been repeated cases of hikers who have fallen and been seriously injured or killed as a result of being intoxicated with alcohol.Gipfelbuch. Accessed on 24 Apr 2011.  Climbing peak  The Frienstein is a popular climbing peak in the Saxon Switzerland Climbing Region, but its summit is not accessible to hikers and walkers. The first recreational ascent of the peak took place in 1873, although it had been conquered before with the help of artificial aids. The route known today as the Alter Weg is classified as climbing grade III. There are also more difficult routes of up to grade XIb. Climbing history was written on the K√∂nigshangel when grade IX was reached for the first time in Saxon Switzerland. In 1965 it was successful climbed for the first time by Fritz Eske, after several unsuccessful attempts by other noteworthy climbers.

Culture The inhabitants of Qdeir are thought to have been nomadic pastoralists who were only part-time farmers from a later Neolithic tradition in comparison to the agriculturalist inhabitants of the village sites of El Kowm. Evidence suggests the location was used as a campsite with only short term occupations deduced from scatters of surface finds. The relationship between the two contemporaneous groups of inhabitants of the area and their behaviors have been discussed by the excavators, who highlight similar construction techniques, use of plaster and basket making. Obsidian, rare stones, stoneware vessels and shells used by both groups also originate from the same places.

Today he is principally remembered as a great supporter of the Library Association of Portland, precursor of the Multnomah County Library, to which he donated his entire collection of over 8,000 volumes at his death in September 1900. Many of his more important volumes continue to form the core of the collection of The John Wilson Special Collection, named in his honor. Early years A native of Ardee, Ireland, Wilson showed an early proclivity for learning in diverse fields and considered a career in the priesthood before deciding to emigrate to the United States. Sailing around Cape Horn, Wilson arrived in California in 1848.MacColl, E. Kimbark. Merchants, Money, and Power: The Portland Establishment 1843-1913. Georgian Press, 1988, p. 36. He did a brief stint with the U.S. Army and unsuccessfully tried his hand at prospecting during the height of the gold rush. Wilson decided to leave California and move to Oregon after a chance meeting in San Francisco with early Portland pioneer and promoter Benjamin Stark in 1850. Stark convinced Wilson, as well as many others, that Oregon offered significant advantages for young men of Wilson's circumstances. Following their meeting, Wilson booked passage to Astoria on Capt. George H. Flanders' ship. Wilson settled in the St. Helens, Oregon, area where he soon found employment but found things \\"very dull\\". Wilson later recalled in an unpublished memoir \\"If I remained there all my life I would not be better off than the wealthiest of the neighbors...Poverty was their wealth...I concluded to go to Portland and cast my lot there.\\" Business activities Portland was fast becoming the center of economic activity in the Pacific Northwest when Wilson arrived in the summer of 1853. Wilson prospered in early Portland and his economic situation steadily improved. Following employment as a clerk in Raleigh's dry-goods store and as a bookkeeper for T.J. Dryer's Weekly Oregonian, Wilson was hired by the successful merchant Cicero Hunt Lewis in 1854. By 1856, the hard- working and thrifty Wilson was in a position to purchase the business of Robert and Finley McLaren for $1,500 in cash and a $6,000 note. In 1857, he formed a three-way partnership with Leland Wakefield of San Francisco and John Connor who ran a second Wilson store in Albany, Oregon. Wilson's business consisted of purchasing agricultural produce from the far-flung farms of the Willamette River Valley for re-sale in Portland or shipment to San Francisco. The farmers in turn bought much-needed goods and supplies from Wilson's store. In 1858, Wilson opened a store on First Street, the first commercial operation in Portland west of Front Street. Later, he moved the store again, becoming the first merchant to open an establishment on Third Street. By 1878, Wilson was in a position to divest his mercantile interests, selling his firm which then became known as Olds and King. For the remainder of his life Wilson focused on his real-estate holdings, civic interests, and book collecting. Philanthropic and social engagements John Wilson was known to his fellow Portlanders as a quiet, studious man of sober habits and intense, diverse intellectual interests. After the death of his first wife, Wilson remarried and had children, settling his family in a large, comfortable house on Fourteenth Street and Taylor Street in what was then the western edge of the fast-growing Portland. Wilson's extensive collection of books, which was accessible to the public on Sundays, eventually came to occupy three large rooms on the ground floor of the home. Wilson was greatly interested in education and served for many years as director of Portland's schools. His passion for learning and books brought him into close affiliation with the Library Association of Portland. In 1863, Wilson's business partner Leland Wakefield began house to house canvassing to raise funds for a library and reading room. Prominent Portlanders such a William Ladd, Henry Failing, Henry Corbett, and Wilson's old boss Cicero Hunt Lewis all contributed money and time to the project. Several of them would eventually serve as directors for the Library Association. Though Wilson never served as director, he was intimately involved with this private institution which was eventually to become today's Multnomah County Library. Book collection At the time of his death, Wilson had amassed one of the largest, if not the largest, private book collections in the western states. Prior to his death in September 1900, he made arrangements with the director of the Library Association of Portland to assume ownership of his entire collection which he endowed with $2,500 in gold, stipulating that the collection remain accessible to the general public. The gift provided the impetus for the construction of a new library building even though the Library Association had just completed construction of a large Italianate-style building after years of fund-raising in 1891.Niles, Philip.

He served as rabbinic leader of Shaarey Zedek Synagogue of Winnipeg, Canada, from 1926 to 1947, and spiritual leader of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal from 1947 until his death. Active in interfaith affairs, he was also a chaplain for Jewish and Christian organizations and hospitals. In Montreal, he broadcast a weekly radio message on Jewish thought and practice for more than 25 years. Early life and education Solomon Frank was born on January 5, 1900, in New York City, the only child of Abraham and Gerta Frank. At age 4, he moved with his parents to Buffalo, New York, where he attended public schools. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from the University at Buffalo in 1922 and a Bachelor of Laws from the same institution in 1923. He received his rabbinic ordination at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. He later earned a master's degree and PhD at the University of Manitoba. Career=New York From 1922 to 1924, Frank served as associate rabbi of Temple Beth Zion in Buffalo. Originally his duties involved teaching high school classes in the temple's religious education division and giving adult lectures. However, due to the illness of the main rabbi, he was called upon to lead the synagogue services. He discussed some of the ideas he lectured about‚ÄîZionism, the situation in Mandatory Palestine, the success of the League of Women Voters, and evolution‚Äîin a local newspaper interview in 1924. He delivered a eulogy for President Woodrow Wilson in the synagogue in February 1924. From 1925 to 1926, Frank served as rabbi of Temple Beth David in the same city. Winnipeg In 1926, Frank was appointed rabbinical leader of Shaarey Zedek Synagogue in Winnipeg, Canada. According to the Manitoba Historical Society, Frank applied his training from his Reform rabbinical seminary to oversee \\"the gradual liberalization of synagogue practice at Shaarey Zedek without initiating any radical breaks with tradition\\". Frank was the first rabbi of an Orthodox synagogue in Western Canada to deliver his sermons in English rather than Yiddish. In 1929, Shaarey Zedek changed its ideology from Orthodox to Conservative, and introduced more English to the services a number of years after that. In addition to his rabbinical duties, Frank was very active in community affairs. He served as president of the Winnipeg lodge of B'nai Brith, president of the League of Nations Society, vice-president of the United Nations Society, and executive director of the Winnipeg Joint Public Relations Committee. He assisted in the founding of the first Winnipeg chapter of the Canadian Legion. During World War II, he was a part-time chaplain with the Canadian army and visited a Canadian field hospital in Europe. He was also a chaplain of the Canadian Club of Winnipeg, the Jewish Scouts and Guides, and Mount Sinai Lodge, president of the 9th Manitoba Provincial Command, Boy Scouts Association, and Grand Chancellor of the Knights of Pythias. In 1939, Frank and his wife were among the 105 prominent Canadian personages invited to a royal luncheon at Government House to welcome the King and Queen. Frank was a popular speaker for both community and civic groups. He was also active in interfaith affairs. In 1935, he delivered a sermon at a \\"joint service of worship and thanksgiving\\" at the city's Knox Church upon the silver jubilee of King George V. In 1940, he joined a symposium with Catholic and Protestant clerics to discuss \\"Common Ground\\". He shared the podium with Dr. E. Crossley Hunter, pastor at Knox Church and chairman of the Canadian Conference of Christians and Jews, at Fellowship Day of the Young Men's Hebrew Association in March 1942. Montreal In 1947, Frank moved to Montreal to become spiritual leader of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal. Under his leadership, daily morning and evening services were reinstated in 1949 along with the Shabbat morning Kiddush. From 1949 onwards, membership increased and overflow services were required on the High Holy Days in two additional locations. Frank was one of the officiators at a synagogue memorial service for King George VI on the day of his funeral, February 15, 1952. In Montreal, too, Frank involved himself in civic and community affairs. He was a member of B'nai Brith and the Montreal Rotary Club, and served as a deputy chaplain at the Masonic Grand Lodge of Quebec. He performed chaplaincy services for the Jewish General Hospital, Verdun General Hospital, Queen Mary Veterans' Hospital, St. Anne's Veterans' Hospital, Montreal Children's Hospital, the Archambault penitentiary, and the Bordeaux jail. In 1948, he was one of the founders of the Cercle juif de lange fran√ßaise, a lecture and publishing society within the Canadian Jewish Congress. In spring 1962, Frank visited Jerusalem and after his return spoke about the religious and historical implications of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls before a meeting of the St. James Literary Society. Frank delivered a popular Sunday-morning radio message on CJAD radio in which he explained aspects of Jewish thought and practice. The program was followed by Jews and Christians alike for a quarter of a century. Awards and honors In 1936, Frank received the Tau Delta Phi medal from the Omega Chapter of the University of Manitoba for his intercultural and interfaith work. In 1962, he was presented with the B'nai Brith Community Service Award for \\"outstanding contribution to life in Montreal\\". In 1968, he was awarded the Canada Centennial Medal. Personal life Frank and his wife, Elsie, had one daughter. Frank died of a brain tumor on October 21, 1982, aged 82. He was buried in the Spanish and Portuguese Section of the Mount Royal Cemetery in Outremont, Quebec. Legacy Upon Frank's death, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal established a memorial fund in his memory. A book of essays, which the editors intended to present to Frank on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, was instead published as a memorial volume for the occasion of the unveiling of his gravestone on October 2, 1983.

It was built as the Imambara of the Shia Muslim community. Hussaini Dalan serves as the main Hussainiya of Dhaka, or venue for majlis or gatherings held during the month of Muharram, tenth day religious gathering commemorates the martyrdom of Hussain, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.  History  Hussaini Dalan in 1904 Hussain Dalan in 1967 According to Taylor (1839), > The principal Mahommedan places of worship are the Edgah and Hossainee > Delaun, the latter is said to have been built by a person named Mir Murad, > who held the Darogahship of the Nawarrah Mehals, and had charge of the > public buildings in the time of Sultan Muhammad Azam. It was built during the Subedari of Prince Shah Shuja (r. 1639-1647 and 1652-1660), son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Although Shuja was a Sunni Muslim, he patronized Shia institutions too. According to tradition, ‚ÄúMir Murad had a vision of Imam Hussain erecting a 'taziah khana' or house of mourning which led to the construction of Hussaini Dalan. Raised on the foundations of a former small taziakhana, the building has undergone alterations. During the rule of the East India Company, it was repaired in 1807 and 1810. The original date of construction is still disputed, but Hussaini Dalan in its present form is attributed to Naib Nazim Nusrat Jung, who rebuilt the imambara in 1823. The present flat roof was rebuilt by Nawab of Dhaka Sir Khwaja Ahsanuallah Bahadur after the earthquake of 1897, and another verandah was added to the southern side..  Architecture  The main building is situated in the middle of complex, built on an area of about 0.65 Bighas (9,380 sq. ft/ 88.05 sq. meters). In the south touching the building there is a ‚Äúpond‚Äù having an area of 1.01 Bighas (14,544 sq. ft/ 1376.95 sq meters). This pond is the main attraction of this building which touches the walls of the buildingShiraji, M. M. (2006). Hussaini Dalan 2006. (n.d) retrieved from: www.hussainidalan.com. Built on a raised platform, it is a long rectangular building with four simple, yet elegant, cabins at the corners. An attractively built arched gateway, to the north gives right of entry to the building, while a stonework water tank is located directly to the south of the building. The exterior incorporates both Mughal and British architectural traditions. The south verandah, overlooking the deep-water tank, best illustrates western background, with four columns of Doric order supporting the verandah. Mughal characteristics are seen in the attached three-storeyed pavilion with arched windows and the row of kanjuras (decorative merlons) on the roof. The main floor of the building is raised on a platform that has rooms containing graves. On the main floor, two large halls known as Shirni hall and Khutba hall are placed back to back to form the nucleus of the building complex. Subsidiary two-storied rooms are on either side of the halls, probably to accommodate a congregation of ladies. And there is a series of three rooms on the east and the west. The side rooms, with the exception of those in the northernmost side room, have galleries on the second storey. Celebrations Shia Muslims are a minority in Dhaka. During the first 10 days of Muharram, Hussaini Dalan becomes a centre of mourning and religious gathering in old Dhaka. Both the Sunni and the Shia followers join the mourning, usually ending in Ashura when a large procession parades through the streets, though mourning continues from 1st day of muharram to 10th of the Islamic month Safar.

The XII position is true north. A clock position, or clock bearing, is the direction of an object observed from a vehicle, typically a vessel or an aircraft, relative to the orientation of the vehicle to the observer. The vehicle must be considered to have a front, a back, a left side and a right side. These quarters may have specialized names, such as bow and stern for a vessel, or nose and tail for an aircraft. The observer then measures or observes the angle made by the intersection of the line of sight to the longitudinal axis, the dimension of length, of the vessel, using the clock analogy. In this analogy, the observer imagines the vessel located on a horizontal clock face with the front at 12:00. Neglecting the length of the vessel, and presuming that he is at the bow, he observes the time number lying on the line of sight. For example, 12 o'clock means directly ahead, 3 o'clock means directly to the right, 6 o'clock means directly behind, and 9 o'clock means directly to the left. The clock system is not confined to transportation. It has general application to circumstances in which the location of one object with respect to another must be systematized. Uses=As a relative bearing This is a system of denoting impromptu relative bearing widely used in practical navigation to give the position of an observed object readily and comprehensibly. \\"Relative\\" means that it does not state or imply any compass directions whatsoever. The vessel can be pointed in any direction. The clock numbers are relative to the direction in which the vessel points. The angular distance between adjacent clock numbers is 30 degrees, a round unit that simplifies mathematical juggling. A quick clock number can be shouted by a lookout, whereas after a calculation and comparison of compass points, which might be unknown anyway, it might be too late for the vessel to avoid danger. As an example of a standard use, the clock position of every approaching vessel is monitored. If the clock number for the observed vessel does not change, it is on a collision course for the observer vessel, as vessels that pass by must change relative bearing. In warfare the clock system is especially useful in drawing attention to enemy locations. The clock system is easily converted into a 360 degree system for more precise denotation. One bearing, or point, is termed an azimuth. The convention is that of analytic geometry: the y-axis at zero degrees is the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. Angles grow larger in the clockwise direction. Thus, directly to port is at 270 degrees. Negative angles are not used. In navigational contexts, the bearing must be stated as 3 digits: 010 (not so in other contexts).Recent USAF practice allows the designation \\"right\\" and \\"left,\\" as in 150 degrees right, thus the degrees can only go up to 180, meaning 6:00. These circles are not to be confused with latitude and longitude, or with any sort of compass reading, which are not relative to the vehicle, but to the magnetic and spin axes of the Earth. As a true bearing For maritime and aviation applications, the clock bearing is almost always a relative bearing; i.e., the angle stated or implied is angular distance from the longitudinal axis of the vessel or imaginary vessel to the bearing. However, if the 12:00 position is associated with a true bearing, then the observed position is also. For example, clock position on a 12-hour analog watch can be used to find the approximate bearing of true north or south on a day clear enough for the sun to cast a shadow. The technique takes a line of sight (LOS) on the visible sun, or on the direction pointed to by a shadow stick, through the hour hand of the watch. It exploits the one true bearing of the sun in its course across the sky: the LOS from the observer to the zenith of its course. There the sun is seen mid-way between sunrise and sunset. A vertical plane including sun and observer is perpendicular to the plane of the sun's course. Its intersection with the surface of the earth is a meridian, a line passing through a geographical pole. If the sun is in the southern half of the sky, the zenith bearing points true south; if northern, north. The time at that moment is 12:00 P.M., solar time. The clock position to the observer is 12. If the watch is set to uncorrected solar time, both hands point to the sun. In a 12-hour watch, the sun and the hour hand both advance, but not at the same rate; the sun covers 15 degrees per hour, and watch 30. To keep the hour hand on the sun, 12:00 must recede from the zenith at the same rate the hour hand advances. Thus when the observer takes an arbitrary LOS, the zenith LOS ‚Äì true north or south ‚Äì is to be found at half the angle between 12 and the LOS. On a 24-hour watch, the sun and the hour hand advance at the same rate. There is no need to half the angle. The zenith LOS is only an approximation due to changes in the time kept by the watch. That time is based on mean solar time rather than observed solar time. Also, time changes with longitude, and the institution of daylight saving time. The time generally available for watch settings in the observer's region is called civil time. It can be corrected to solar time, but LOS on a watch is generally too imprecise to make the trouble worth the effort. Examples=From aviation In World War II aircraft pilots needed a quick method of communicating the relative position of threats, for which the clock system was ideal. The gunners of a bomber, or the other aircraft in the squadron, had to be kept informed for purposes of immediate response. However, in aviation, a clock position refers to a horizontal direction. The pilots needed a vertical dimension, so they supplemented the clock position with the word high or low to describe the vertical direction; e.g., 6 o'clock high means behind and above the horizon, while 12 o'clock low means ahead and below the horizon. The horizon line was only visible in clear weather in daylight, and was only useful as a reference line in straight and level flight, when it appeared on the nose of the aircraft. The vocabulary therefore was only of use during daylight patrols or missions. The reference line and reference clock positions did not exist during combat aerobatics, at night, or during cloudy weather, when other means had to be found for locating the combatants, such as radar. From community planning In 1916, J.B. Plato devised a clock system to identify farms around reference points in rural areas. A clock face was imagined centered on a rural community with 12:00 pointing true north. The circle was divided into concentric numbered bands at each mile of radius. The bands were divided into 12 segments at each position of the clock numbered after the clock hour. Within a segment, every building was assigned a letter. For instance, Alton 3-0 L meant house L in segment 3 of the central circle of 1 mile radius at Alton, where 3 was at 3:00. From medicine Medical pathology uses the clock system to describe the location of breast tumors. A clock face is considered imposed over each breast, left and right, centered on the alveolar region, with the positions shown around it. Tumors are located at one or more subsites, or clock positions, identified by one or more clock numbers. In addition the numbers are arranged in quadrants: Upper Outer Quadrant (UOQ), Lower Inner Quadrant (LIQ), and so on. Codes are assigned to the quadrants, the alveolar region, and the whole breast. From golf Golf players use the clock system to study the course of the ball in putting situations. For holes that are on a slope, the hole is imagined to be the center of a clock face with 12:00 at the high point and 6:00 at the low point. The ball will only run true when hit from the high or low points; otherwise, its course will break, or bend on the slope. Some golfers practice clock drill - hitting the ball from all the positions of the clock - to learn how it breaks. From microscopy An article in the Journal of Applied Microscopy for 1898 recommends the use of a polar coordinate system in the form of a clockface for recording the positions of microscopic objects on a slide. The face is conceived centered on the circle visible under the lens. The pole is the center. Angle is given as a clock number, and distance as a decimal percentage of the radius through the object. For example, ‚Äú3,9‚Äù means 3:00 o‚Äôclock at 9 tenths of the radius. Instrumentation Although the raw clock position is invaluable or indispensable in many circumstances requiring rapid response, for ordinary careful navigation it is not sufficiently precise. It can be made precise by various methods requiring the use of instruments. Origin of the clock positions Roman basin sundial, a Mesopotamian type. The pointer casts a shadow over the engraved hour lines in the basin. The hours are numbered I-XII, running from the first hour of the day on the left to the last on the right. The pointer is set at meridies, ‚Äúmid-day,‚Äù which is at 6:00. The hours are ‚Äúseasonal;‚Äù that is, the number of degrees in an hour depends on the day of the year. 6:00 is intended to be a true bearing; that is, at 12:00 solar time the shadow over the VI line must point due north or south. The clock face with its clock positions is a heritage of Roman civilization, as is suggested by the survival of Roman numerals on old clocks and their cultural predecessors, sundials. The mechanical clock supplanted the sundial as the major timekeeper, while the Hindu‚ÄìArabic numeral system replaced the Roman as the number system in Europe in the High Middle Ages. The Romans, however, had adapted their timekeeping system from the Ancient Greek. The historical trail leads from there to ancient Mesopotamia through the ancient Greek colonies placed on the coast of Anatolia in the 1st millennium BC. The first known historian, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who was a native of that border region, made the identification: :‚Äù the sunclock (polon) and the sundial (gnomon), and the twelve divisions of the day, came to Hellas not from Egypt but from Babylonia.‚ÄùBook II, Section 109. The polos (‚Äúpole‚Äù) was a sundial of a concave face resembling the concavity of the universe (named a ‚Äúpole‚Äù in this case). The gnomon was the pointer. The Mesopotamian system The Babylonian time system is documented by thousands of Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets. The Babylonians inherited the better part of their system from the Sumerians, whose culture they absorbed. Tablets of different periods reveal the development of a sexagesimal numbering system from decimal and duodecimal systems, which reveals itself in the construction of unique symbols for numerals 1-59 from natural finger decimals (ten fingers, ten symbols). Why they developed this system is a matter for academic debate, but there are multiple advantages, including division by several factors, offering several possible subdivisions, one of which is by 12's.For the essentials of the Babylonian number system, refer to Classical civilization adopted and adapted the Mesopotamian time system, and modern civilization adapted it still further. The modern system retains much of the sexagesimalism of the Sumerians, but typically not with the same detail.For the development chronology of the system as revealed by the tablets, refer to Time today and generally in ancient Mesopotamia is given mainly in three digits. Today's state the hours, minutes, and seconds. In a strict sexagesimal system these three would be expressed in a single, three-digit sexagesimal number: h,m,s with values on each of the three letters of 0-59; that is, hours up to 60, minutes up to 60, and seconds up to 60. Because integer numbers are expressed as sums, in this case :h times 602 \\\\+ m times 60 + s for the number of seconds, h, m, and s can be broken out and treated as separate numbers. Each number, however, implies the other two; e.g., a minute implies 60 seconds. m and s are straightforward, but h is different. There are no explicit 60 hours; the number instead is 24, and yet they are part of an implied sexagesimal system. 60 minutes is implied by one of the 24 hours, not one of the 60. The system is not strictly sexagesimal but is based on the sexagesimal. A full Babylonian time determination also had three digits. Zeros were blank spaces, causing some difficulty of discerning them from character separators. For reasons that are not clear, the Mesopotamians adopted a standard of 12 hours per day for their first-order digit. Their day, however, was designed for measurement on their most ancient and widely used timepiece, the sundial, which showed only daylight hours. Daylight was the time between sunrise and sunset, each of those being defined as the appearance or disappearance of the top rim of the sun on the horizon. Daylight hours problematically were seasonal; that is, due to the variation of the length of the day with time of year, hour length was variable also. The Mesopotamians had discovered, however, that if the darkness was divided into 12 hours also, and each run of 12 was matched number for number: 1st to 1st, 2nd to 2nd, etc., the sum of each match was constant. The 12-hour, seasonal day was one of many metrological arrangements that had developed during the 3rd millennium BC. It was in use in the Ur III period, at the end of the 3rd millennium. The vocabulary of time was not yet set. For example, the 60-hour day existed as the time-shekel, 1/60 of a working day, presumably so named from the labor cost of one hexagesimal hour. This was a time of strong kings and continuing administrations that took responsibility for weights and standards. Englund distinguishes two main types of system: the cultic, in which the events of the seasonal calendar assume religious significance, and are perpetuated for religious reasons, and a second, new type, the state, defined by an administration that needed to standardize its time units. The state system came to predominate in the subsequent Old Babylonian period. The state administrators had perceived that the sun advances at a uniform rate no matter what the season. One sun cycle is always the same. Moreover, it matches the cycle of rotation of the stars around the pole star, the real reason being that the Earth rotates at a constant angular velocity. If hours were to represent divisions of the uniform rotation, they must also be uniform, and not be variable. There were two days of the year when all 24 hours were of the same length: the two equinoxes. The standard double hour (beru), of equinoctial length, representing two modern hours, of which there were 12 in the standard day (umu), was not conceived as being one of day and one of night, but as being just two consecutive equal-length hours. One standard day thus went on to become two consecutive equal 12-hour clockfaces in modern clock time. 30 standard days were a standard month, and 12 of those a standard year of 360 days. Some juggling of month lengths to make the 12 months fit the year was still required. Within a day, single hours were unreliable. They came in all sizes. The double hour, however, originally the sum of a daylight hour and the corresponding night hour, was always the same. The statists therefore chose to use double units in definition. The 12-hour daytime had been divided into three seasonal watches. These were matched to three seasonal night watches, 1st to 1st, 2nd to 2nd, etc. One double watch (8 hours) was four double hours. One single watch (four hours) was two double hours. To produce a second-order digit of a Babylonian time, the statists changed from solar to stellar time. The stars moved in visible circles at a fixed rate, which could be measured by the constant escape of water from a water clock. The single standard watch of 4 hours (two double hours) was divided into 60 time-degrees (ush). One double hour had 30, and one complete stellar day, 360 (12 times 30). This assignment was the creation of the 360-degree circle, as the degree went from being a time division to an angular distance of rotation. Time- degrees were all the same (one is about 4 minutes of modern time). The second- order digit counted the degrees that had gone by in the hour, notwithstanding the fact that its number of degrees were seasonal. The third and last order digit divided the time-degree into 60 parts (the gar), which appears to be sexagesimal. In modern time it is 4 seconds. There are not 60 time-degrees in an hour, nor 60 hours in a day. The Babylonian time was thus three different numbers, only one of which was sexagesimal. Only its general features are modern: the 12-hour day followed by a 12-hour night, the 60-division 3rd-order digit, and the 360-degree circle. In media and culture The 1949 movie Twelve O'Clock High takes its title from the system. In this case, the position would be ahead and above the horizon, an advantageous position for the attacker. The phrase \\"on your six\\" refers to the six o'clock or the adjacent positions; that is, the expression cautions that someone is behind.

The most prominent member was Prince Klemens von Metternich, who was the dominant figure at the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì1815). As a former reigning house, Metternich family belonged to the small circle of high nobility. Background Evolution of the Metternich arms The family originated as a cadet branch of the lords of Hemmerich (which today is a district of Bornheim, near Bonn). The head of the family rose to have the position of hereditary chamberlain of the Elector of Cologne. This branch of the family drew its name from the village of Metternich in Weilerswist beginning in the 13th century. By the 16th century, the family had seven distinct branches: * Metternich-Burscheid * Metternich-Winneburg * Metternich- Chursdorf * a branch in Lorraine * a branch in the Duchy of J√ºlich * a second branch in the Duchy of J√ºlich Metternich-Burscheid Lothar Friedrich von Metternich-Burscheid (1617‚Äì1675), Elector of Mainz Dieter von Metternich acquired Zievel by marriage in 1494, and came to be ruler of Burscheid. His son, also named Dieter von Metternich (died 1600) styled himself Lord of Mersch and Esch-sur-S√ªre. His grandson, Wolfgang Heinrich von Metternich (died 1699) acquired Dodenburg, Neckar, Steinbach, and Densborn. Wolfgang Heinrich von Metternich's brother Lothar Friedrich von Metternich-Burscheid was Elector of Mainz. Metternich-Chursdorf A second line of the family, founded by Johann Reinhard Freiherr von Metternich, came to rule Chursdorf. This branch of the family converted to the Protestant faith. Johann Reinhard Freiherr von Metternich's son Ernst von Metternich, made a Graf in 1697, was a soldier in the service of Frederick I of Prussia and a member of the privy council of Brandenburg-Prussia. Ernst von Metternich was involved in the diplomacy that saw Frederick I granted the title King in Prussia, in Prussia's acquisition of Neuch√¢tel, and in the negotiating of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Ernst von Metternich's brother was a member of the privy council of the Principality of Ansbach and in 1726 became Chancellor of Schwarzburg. He was also an author on questions of theosophy and alchemy. Metternich-Winneburg-Beilstein The Lordship of Winneburg‚ÄìBeilstein in the Moselle Valley Lothar von Metternich (1551‚Äì1623), Elector of Trier Franz Georg Karl von Metternich-Winneburg- Beilstein (1746‚Äì1818) Klemens von Metternich (1773‚Äì1859) Princess Pauline von Metternich (1836‚Äì1921) In 1635, the family of the Elector of Trier, Lothar Johann Reinhard von Metternich (1515‚Äì1623), acquired the immediate Lordship of Beilstein, which made them free from any other overlord than the emperor, and began styling themselves as Freiherren von Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein. Their title was upgraded to Graf in 1679. Lothar Johann Reinhard von Metternich's nephews, Karl von Metternich and Emmerich von Metternich, were opposed to the policies of the Elector of Trier Philipp Christoph von S√∂tern. In 1623‚Äì30, the Imperial Quartermaster General, Lothar von Metternich, and his brother Wilhelm purchased the lordships of L√°znƒõ Kyn≈ævart and the village of Metternich near Koblenz. Wilhelm's eldest son, Karl Heinrich von Metternich- Winneburg, was Elector of Mainz and Prince-Bishop of Worms in 1679. The younger son, Philip Emmerich von Metternich (d. 1698), was raised to the rank of Graf. The last Count of Metternich-Winneburg was Franz Georg Karl von Metternich-Winneburg-Beilstein, who lost the ancestral lordship to France by the 1801 Treaty of Lun√©ville. In compensation, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, gave him the secularized Ochsenhausen Abbey and raised him to the rank of F√ºrst in 1803. Their immediate territories were mediatized by W√ºrttemberg in 1806. His son, Klemens von Metternich, worked in the service of the Austrian Empire; he was a major diplomat at the Congress of Vienna and was Minister- President of Austria from 1821 to 1848. He acquired Schloss Johannisberg in the Rheingau. Klemens' eldest surviving son, Richard von Metternich, was a diplomat and married his half-niece, Pauline S√°ndor de Szlavnicza (she was the daughter of Richard's half-sister, Leonore). Richard and Pauline von Metternich had three daughters, but no sons, so upon the death of Richard, the title of F√ºrst passed to Richard's half-brother, Paul von Metternich (1834‚Äì1906). The title then passed to his son, Klemens Wenzel von Metternich (1869‚Äì1930). His son, Paul Alfons von Metternich-Winneburg (1917‚Äì1992), was the president of ADAC. He was the last male Metternich, and the title of F√ºrst became extinct with his death. The situation had forced him to sell his family estate Schloss Johannisberg, with its famous winery, to the Oetker family in 1974. The family name however passed to Franz Albrecht Metternich-S√°ndor (1920‚Äì2009), whose mother was a descendant of Klemens von Metternich and who had been adopted by his aunt, Clementine von Metternich-S√°ndor (1870‚Äì1963). Franz Albrecht Metternich-S√°ndor, the son of Victor III, Duke of Ratibor and Prince of Corvey (a branch of the princely house of Hohenlohe) inherited his father's titles. Franz Albrecht's eldest son is Viktor Metternich-S√°ndor (born 1964), who has headed the ducal House of Ratibor and Corvey since his father's death.

She also feels she has seen the home before, and realizes an illustration of it appears on one of her novels, entitled The Nesting. One day, while investigating the turret at the peak of the house, Lauren becomes trapped outside on the window ledge, and has a vision of a woman inside. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Webber, arrives at the house, and is killed while attempting to save her. Several days later, Lauren is attacked by Frank Beasley, a handyman, at the house. Amidst the attack, he begins to levitate, and flees the house in terror; he has a vision of two women's corpses lying in his truck, and he flees into the woods, and stumbles into a pond, where he is dragged under by ghostly hands and drowns. Lauren, bothered by the events occurring in the house, visits a local man, Abner Welles, to ask about the house after having heard Frank mention his name. Abner, a drunk with a bad reputation in town, becomes erratic and violent when she inquires about the house's history, and chases her away in his car. The two get into a car accident, and Lauren flees on foot and hides in a barn. Abner finds her, and attempts to attack her with a pitchfork, but it is torn from his hands by an unseen force. Lauren then stabs him through the head with a scythe, killing him. Lauren's visions in the house become increasingly bizarre, and she begins having precognitive dreams. It is revealed by Col. Lebrun to Daniel that the home was a former brothel during World War II, and that Frank and Abner murdered several prostitutes and soldiers in the home and dumped their bodies in the nearby pond. At the house, Lauren has an intense hallucination, in which she meets Florinda (Gloria Grahame), the madame of the brothel, and it is revealed that she is Florinda's granddaughter and, as an infant, was the lone survivor of the murders in the home. At the end of the film, she experiences a vivid hallucination in which her manuscript begins burning, and she witnesses Frank's truck crash into the house, and catch fire. At the end of the vision, she comes back to reality, and stumbles out of the house at dawn. Cast Production  The film was primarily shot on location at the Armour-Stiner House at 45 West Clinton Avenue in Irvington, New York. Release The film was given a limited theatrical release in the United States by William Mishkin Motion Pictures beginning in May 1981. Home media The film was later released on VHS by Warner Home Video. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Blue Underground in June 2011, and as a DVD/Blu-ray Mediabook by German company Motion Picture in May 2014. The latter edition features both a 103-minute and a 99-minute cut.  Critical reception  Candice Russell, film and theater writer for the Fort Lauderdale News, described the film as a \\"nifty Gothic thriller\\" with director Armand Weston having \\"a firm hand on his material except for a prolonged chase near film's end\\". TV Guide awarded the film 1/5 stars, calling it \\"an intriguing effort that effectively combines traditional haunted-house chills with a more modern emphasis on gore.\\" Kurt Dahlke from DVD Talk gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"[an] under-the-radar 1980s potboiler\\". Dahlke criticized the film's lack of chills, \\"slo-mo sleuthing\\", and Loomis' character. Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! wrote, \\"The Nesting sort of drags in general; it‚Äôs certainly too long at 103 minutes and is wildly uneven. When it wants to be a straight-up haunted house horror show, it works well; the score is definitely a high point when the film is in this mode, as the frenzied music shrieks to create tension and mood. I suppose the main problem is that it just doesn‚Äôt want to be that type of film enough.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:1981 films Category:1981 horror films Category:American films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Video nasties ","title":"The Nesting"},{"id":"31585413","text":"Meet Me Halfway, at Least is the debut album from English rock band Deaf Havana.

Wolfgang was born on 6 April 1531 in Herzberg, the fifth son of Duke Philip I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and his second wife, Catherine of Mansfeld. He succeeded his brother, Ernest as Duke in 1567, governing the tiny Principality of Grubenhagen. Like most of his predecessors, he had financial problems, so he was often forced to sell or pledge major parts of his possession and he had to demand high taxes. In 1581 he gave the citizens of Herzberg the right to provide for their own fuel and timber as well as leaves for fertilizing their fields. He attempted to improve the educational level in his country by establishing a court school in Herzberg. In 1593 he dissolved the county of Lauterberg-Scharzfeld as a fief, to counter the demands of the Counts of Stolberg. In the same year, he confirmed the Harz mining regulations of 1554 and gave Herzberg citizens the right to brew beer and a licence to trade wine. He created a pleasure garden for his wife Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg (born 11 March 1543; died 5 April 1586; daughter of Francis I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg) below Herzberg Castle. Wolfgang died on 14 May 1595 in Herzberg and was buried next to his parents, brothers and wife in the crypt of the St. Giles Church in Osterode am Harz. He had no children. His younger brother Philip II inherited the principality. On Philip II's death, the Grubenhagen line of the House of Welf died out.

It is a part of the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church. Congregation The congregation traces its roots to 1909, when the church had their first meeting in a former dance hall shortly after Pacific Union College's move to Angwin from Healdsburg. It records having 42 charter members at that time. In 1919, the congregation met in the chapel of the new college building and by 1921 had 290 members. Until 1947, the pastor was the head of the college's religion department. The congregation moved into its own new building in 1968. Like most churches of the time, its practices were traditional in form with weekly performances by its church choir. By 1984, the church plant was worth an estimated $7.7 million due to inflation, it had cost less than a third of that amount to construct in 1968. When Healdsburg College, now PUC, was first established, the College operated all levels of the educational experience. However, starting in 1901, the College Church took over the financial responsibility for the elementary school. They raised a church-school fund. All the children of the church were free to attend the school. In 2000, PUC Church was noted for being the only church in the Northern California Conference of Seventh-day Adventists to have a female pastor. Pastors from the church have been featured at various events hosted by Adventist Churches. The church is active in philanthropy. In 2010 the church raised over $25,000 to aid in relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The church has 1,800 members, not including the 1,500 students attending Pacific Union College. Theologian Desmond Ford continued to hold membership at the church after being defrocked. Many years later, in 2001, he voluntarily requested to have his name dropped from membership for reasons which seem to be unrelated to his defrocking. Rieger Pipe Organ The stage of the PUC Church is dominated by Pacific Union College's pipe organ made by organ builder Rieger Orgelbau in the town of Schwarzach in Austria. The organ rises above the front stage of the sanctuary, and its 4,000 pipes range in size from two inches to 20 feet. During planning, designers were concerned about the tendency of the organ to make the balcony shake, leading them to place it at the front of the church. The organ is distinguished by its significant French influences, departing from Rieger's previous work based on Germanic sympathies; it was influenced by organs built by Frenchmen Dom B√©dos de Celles, Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll, Fran√ßois-Henri Clicquot and Robert Clicquot. When installation was completed in 1981, it was the largest organ that Rieger's company had constructed. In 1996, a group of German organists listed the organ as one of the top 35 most important organs in the United States.

This consisted of three buildings, one of which was a bath-house, along the line of what was to become the north-west range. 3rd century mosaic Early in the 3rd century the south-west and north-east wings were added, partially enclosing the courtyard. By the 4th century some of the buildings on the north western and south western ranges had been rebuilt and extended. In its 4th century form the villa had 60 rooms built on three sides of the courtyard with the fourth side formed by a corridor in which the gateway was set. The villa was luxurious, including four bath suites, 16 rooms containing mosaic pavements, 11 rooms with plain tessellated floors and another 11 rooms with under-floor hypocaust heating. Further ranges of farm buildings lie to the south west of the main complex, and aerial photographs indicate that the site extended over a large area on the west bank of the River Evenlode. The villa was abandoned in the 5th century. The villa is notable for its 3rd century mosaic in what is believed to have been the dining room. This floor was lifted and relaid in 1929, and is now protected by a purpose built shed.

Playing a native girl and a tribal chief's daughter, Brissac paddled canoes and danced with Hawaiian natives throughout November and December before finally sailing home to San Francisco on January 28, 1914 aboard the steamship Wilhelmina.Honolulu Star- Bulletin, \\"Great Interest in Opening of Stock Season\\", December 20, 1912, p. 7; \\"Promises for the Playhouses\\", October 20, 1913, p. 5; \\"Passengers Departed\\", January 28, 1914, p. 2 On June 29, 1915, Brissac and Wray were married in Santa Ana, California\\"California, County Marriages, 1850-1952,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K8DJ-J4L : accessed 25 Jan 2014), \\"John Wray and Virginia Brissac, 1915\\" and then returned to San Diego where they continued to live and work for the next six years. Before opening her own stock company at San Diego's Strand Theatre, with Wray as managing director, Brissac returned to the Bay area on August 5, 1917 to give a \\"Farewell\\" performance as The Eternal Magdalene at the Bishop Playhouse in Oakland, then took the 'Brissac World's Fair Stock Company' on a tour in Australia. 1918-1921 In the middle of their record-breaking four-year residency at the Strand Theatre, Wray was hired to direct films for Thomas H. Ince at the newly formed Ince/MGM Studios and began spending more time in Los Angeles than in San Diego. With stock theatre in rapid decline, the Strand Theatre closed in 1921 and Brissac finally left San Diego to join him. Her daughter Ardel came to live with them a short time later. (Ardel would eventually take John Wray's last name and, as Ardel Wray, later became a Hollywood screenwriter remembered for such films as I Walked With a Zombie, The Leopard Man and Isle of the Dead).Ardel Wray - Internet Movie Database accessed 5.5.13 Some time after the release of his silent film adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie in 1923, John Wray began a long affair with screenwriter Josephine McLaughlin (aka Bradley King) and Brissac finally divorced him in May 1927. Although she would do encore performances in San Diego several years later and take roles in one or two little theatre productions in the 1950s, the move to Los Angeles effectively brought Brissac's twenty year long stage career to an end. By 1934, Stock theatre was dead and, at the age of fifty-two, she would have to find another way to make a living. Career in film and television During the years she lived with John Wray in Culver City, Brissac became friends with the Laemmle family and many of the people working with them and Thomas Ince, among them actress Carol Lombard and entertainer Russ Columbo. After her divorce, Brissac worked as Columbo's private secretary and assistant for a time, a job that might have continued indefinitely but for his untimely death in September 1934. While chatting with industry photographer Lansing Brown one night in Brown's studio, Colombo asked about an antique dueling pistol that Brown owned. Brown picked up the pistol to show it to Columbo and was fiddling with it when it accidentally discharged, sending a bullet ricocheting off a coffee table and into Columbo, who died a few hours later. Brissac had to identify Colombo for the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office and testify about the accident at the inquest, which made headlines in newspapers across the country. A few months later, Arthur Lubin, a former member of the San Diego Stock company, gave Brissac her break into acting in Hollywood. Lubin had joined Brissac's company sometime after he graduated high school in San Diego, and he was one of the people who took over managing it when Wray went to work for Ince. When the Strand Theatre closed its doors in 1921, Lubin had followed Wray and Brissac to Hollywood. Learning of Brissac's situation after Colombo's death, he cast her as Mrs. Van Twerp in his 1935 comedy Honeymoon Limited, and by 1937 she had become an established character actress in Hollywood. Virginia Brissac in Captain From Castile (1947) Over the course of the next eighteen years, Brissac would be cast in more than 155 films and appear in episodes of the television series Dragnet, The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse, I Love Lucy, Crown Theatre with Gloria Swanson, Mayor of the Town (1954 series based on the 1940s radio show) and The Lone Wolf. Retirement and death Brissac was seventy- two years old when she got the part of Jim Stark's grandmother in Rebel Without a Cause in 1955. Beginning to have trouble remembering her lines, she did one or two commercials after that and then retired. The money she made as a film actress had been invested for her by her only brother, Belnore Brissac Jr., and those investments, along with social security and small Equity and motion picture industry pension checks allowed her to live out the rest of her life in modest comfort. She lived another twenty-five years and outlived almost everyone she knew before she died on July 26, 1979 at the age of ninety-six in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her ashes are interred with those of her parents and other Brissac family members in the columbarium at Mt. Olivet Memorial Park in Colma, California, south of San Francisco. Virginia Brissac, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Edward Platt and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause Legacy Although not unique, Brissac's career was unusual for its length (over fifty years) and its geographical and historical arc: A contemporary of Theda Bara, Isadora Duncan, and Eleanor Roosevelt, she was born eighteen years after the end of the American Civil War and only a few years after the advent of street lights and cable cars in San Francisco. In a 1919 publicity stunt, she became the first air parcel post package in the United States, flown from San Diego to Los Angeles in a two-seater single engine plane wearing a helmet covered with postage stamps, and she owned and drove one of the first Roamer Coupes. She acted in her first movie two years before D.W. Griffith released Birth of a Nation, worked for twenty years in the film and television industries that would replace stock theatre and sideline radio, and died only two years before the first IBM PC went on the market in 1981. Brissac's career was memorialized in a biographical article titled \\"The Coast Defender: Virginia Brissac, San Diego's Sweetheart\\" published in The San Diego Magazine in 1971. The article is based on extensive correspondence and interviews with Brissac and various people she worked with in San Diego, and it focuses primarily on her decade long celebrity there. But the article also includes reminiscences of her early career and provides insights into the history and workings of West Coast Stock companies in the early 1900s. Brissac's professional scrapbooks were donated to the San Diego History Center in 2016.

Preceded by the show Discotheque which had been hosted by Dianne Greaves, (Name sometimes spelt Diane) (Name sometimes spelt Dianne) the replacement was originally entitled Lift Off and was aired in the children's programming schedule, but was seen by many as ITV's junior answer to the BBC's Top Of The Pops. Ayshea (formally Ayshea Brough) had appeared on the earlier Discotheque in March 1969 and was one of the first women of Asian heritage to present a British television series, initially co-hosting the show with Graham Bonney and later singer Wally Whyton. The series was produced by Muriel Young, who also produced Clapperboard, Shang-A-Lang and Get It Together for ITV Granada. The premise of the show was to showcase music requested by viewers writing in to the series. The requests were interspersed with performances of either new releases or current hits. Generally, only two or three guest acts would appear each week; the majority of the songs were performed by Ayshea herself or would be played into the studio and a dance troupe would choreograph the track. The main dance ensemble were known as The Feet; identical twin sisters Teresa and Lesley Scoble, who were concurrently appearing in the ITV children's drama Timeslip throughout the 1970 run. For one series, a resident band known as The Pattern sang selected tracks each week. Series 5 featured Guy Lutman, Lynn Garner and Chris Marlow as the resident singers. Later series featured the puppets Ollie Beak and Fred Barker as co-hosts. During the series' run, Ayshea contributed a column to the children's magazines Look-in and Disco 45. She also teamed up with Roy Wood to record his composition Farewell, which was released as a single and used as the show's theme tune. Wood's band Wizzard often appeared on the series and Brough appeared on Top Of The Pops, backing Wizzard on several occasions. When performing with Wizzard, Wood often sported a white star with the initial 'A' in the centre of his forehead, while Brough wore the same make-up featuring an 'R'. This led to some media speculation that the two were involved in an unconfirmed relationship, with many reports claiming they were engaged. Although the track failed to chart, Ayshea performed the song on Top of the Pops on BBC1. Of the 144 episodes made, only three are confirmed as having survived in the ITV archives.

Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall no ambassadors were exchanged. The official policy of East Germany emphasized the necessity to differentiate between Jews and the Israeli state. This approach, stemming originally from the theories of Marx and Lenin on nationalism, class struggle, and the \\"irreconcilable struggle between socialism and imperialism\\" also served to counter accusations of antisemitism. In this context, a specific relationship or responsibility of the German people to the Jewish state was denied. Relations can be divided into 3 periods: positive neutrality (1948‚Äì1956), confrontation (1956‚Äì1985) and movement towards rapprochement (1986‚Äì1990). History=Positive neutrality The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (known by its German initials SED), the East German communist party, welcomed the 1947 decision of the United Nations to divide Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state. A special announcement of the SED Central Committee early in 1948 stated the following: \\"We consider the foundation of a Jewish state an essential contribution enabling thousands of people who suffered greatly under Hitler's fascism to build a new life\\". Politburo member Paul Merker wrote on 24 February 1948 in Neues Deutschland, \\"The Jewish population has the sympathy and active assistance of all progressive forces. Especially the democratic forces in Germany are compelled to show their sympathy and readiness to help\\". Deterioration According to the German translation of the complete works of Stalin, Stalin Werke, published in East Berlin in 1950, Zionism was a 'reactionary nationalistic movement that had its followers among the Jewish bourgeoisie, the intellectual elite and the backward strata of the Jewish mass of workers. The Zionists strove for the isolation of the Jewish mass of workers from the collective struggle of the proletariat.Stalin, Werke, vol. 2 (East Berlin 1950), pg. 364. But there was another, more international, immediate reason for the anti-Zionist course upon which the East German government embarked at the beginning of the 1950s ‚Äì the accusations against the leading Czechoslovak party functionary, Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω. Sl√°nsk√Ω and his so-called \\"group\\" were accused in 1952 of a \\"Zionist conspiracy\\". On 20 December 1952, the Central Committee of the SED proclaimed the \\"lessons from the trial against the group of plotters around Sl√°nsk√Ω\\". In this proclamation, the Central Committee issued the following statement: After the death of Stalin, the Israeli government showed some interest in establishing normal relations with the Eastern Bloc. As for East Germany not only did the unresolved German question ‚Äì the existence of two German states as members of the Eastern and Western alliances ‚Äì preclude a positive approach, but so did the refusal of the SED to negotiate with Jewish and Israeli representatives on reparations. Bilateral talks took place in Moscow from 1954 until 1956. During this time all negotiations were closely linked to the question of material compensation to individuals for Nazi crimes committed against Jews, an issue also discussed in connection with the Luxembourg Agreement. An internal report by the East German Foreign Ministry in January 1963 noted \\"The relatively good relations with some Arab states must not be aggravated by striving to establish official relations with Israel, in the present stage of the struggle for the international recognition of the GDR\\".East Germany and the Middle East Confrontation Since the end of the 1950s the attitude of the GDR leadership toward the Middle East conflict and the Palestinian question had become more and more pro-Arab and anti-Israeli. This shift became especially clear during Suez War, the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War and the Lebanon War. After the Six-Day War all countries of the Eastern Bloc with the exception of Romania broke off diplomatic relations with Israel. Their position strongly influenced the approach of the East German government toward Israel. The GDR condemned the \\"imperialist aggression of Israel\\" and accused \\"the United States and West Germany of being accomplices to the aggressor\\". Resolutions from SED meetings and communiqu√©s signed by East German officials stressed the \\"GDR's firm solidarity with the Arab states in the anti- imperialist struggle, especially in repelling Israeli aggression and overcoming its consequences\\". In 1968, Simon Wiesenthal stated that East Germany's news service was far more anti-Israeli than that of other communist countries. On 14 July 1967, a cartoon appeared in the Berliner Zeitung, depicting a flying Moshe Dayan, with his hands stretched out toward Gaza and Jerusalem. Next to him stood Adolf Hitler in an advanced state of decomposition. He encouraged Dayan with the words: \\"Carry on, colleague Dayan!\\"J. H. Brinks, \\"Political Anti-Fascism in the German Democratic Republic\\", Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 32, No. 2, 1997, pg. 207-17. Since the early 1970s, East Germany cooperated with Arab countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization at a military level. Military and security advisers were especially active in Libya, Syria and South Yemen. The PLO played an important role in all East German political strategies concerning the Middle East. The first official agreement between the SED and the PLO was signed during Yasser Arafat's visit to East Berlin in August 1973. The agreement included the opening of a PLO office in East Berlin - its first office in Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the supply of \\"non-civilian goods\\" to the PLO was arranged.Jewish Claims against East Germany: Moral Obligations and Pragmatic Policy, p.250-251 The SED notion of Zionism was summed up in an internal document compiled by the State Secretariat for Church Affairs in 1972 as a \\"reactionary-nationalist ideology of the Jewish big bourgeosie\\".Timm 1997, p. 248. The close cooperation between East Germany and the PLO was one reason why Israel objected to the GDR becoming a member of the UN in 1973. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Yosef Tekoah, stated in the General Assembly on September 18, 1973 that \\"Israel notes with regret and repugnance that the other German state (GDR) has ignored and continues to ignore Germany's historical responsibility for the Holocaust and the moral obligations arising from it. It has compounded the gravity of that attitude by giving support and practical assistance to the campaign of violence and murder waged against Israel and the Jewish people by Arab terror organizations\\".Israel's struggle in the UN In the Yom Kippur War East Germany supplied Syria with 75,000 grenades, 30,000 mines, 62 tanks and 12 fighter jets.Marc Fisher. \\"E. Germany Ran Antisemitic Campaign in West in ‚Äô60s\\", The Washington Post, February 28, 1993 In 1975 East Germany voted in favour of U.N resolution condemning Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. This was propagated by the East German media, with the teachers' union Deutsche Lehrezeitung asserting that \\"there is a common ideological platform between Zionism and Fascism. It is racism\\".Timm 1997, p.253. and articles condemning \\"aggressive and chauvinist Zionism\\".Nations United: How the United Nations Undermines Israel and the West The official anti-Israeli foreign policy continued into the 1980s: The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 was denounced by the government as Israel's fifth war against the Arab states. This was bolstered by the National People's Army, which published a lengthy article in August 1982 likening Israeli aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese people to the crimes of German Nazism in World War II and those of American imperialism against Vietnam. Reparations The first article in Neues Deutschland that responded to the reparations agreement was not published until two months later, three days after excerpts of the indictment in the Slansky trial were printed. The article spoke of \\"a deal between powerful West German and Israeli capitalists\\" under the headline \\"Reparations- For Whom?\\". Leo Zuckermann participated in several talks with the Israeli consul to West Germany, Dr. Eliyahu Livne. On December 1952 he escaped to West Berlin, declaring that he was about to be arrested on the grounds of a \\"Zionist conspiracy\\". After Stalin died in March 1953, Israel hoped to negotiate reparations agreement with the East German government but the latter refused so.State and Minorities in Communist East Germany ReferencesFurther reading * Israel Germany, East Category:Germany‚ÄìIsrael relations ","title":"East Germany‚ÄìIsrael relations"},{"id":"31585775","text":"Hal Stone Dean (October 30, 1922 ‚Äì February 12, 2011) was a left guard for the Los Angeles Rams in the National Football League, playing three seasons from 1947 to 1949.NFL.com Career Stats Early life Hal was born to Forest William Dean and Vernon Stone Dean in Wooster, Ohio.

It is a member of the class of compounds known as histrionicotoxins. This alkaloid skin secretion was first isolated from the tropical frog in 1977 by Daly and his fellow workers. Biological uses This compound is a relatively non-toxic chemical. At first it showed activity as a slight muscarinic antagonist, but with recent studies it has showed other interesting neurological activities. Due to these new activities, many laboratories want to conduct future research on it. Due to this demand and the scaracity and unabundance of the tree frog the synthesis of this product is of much interest.  Synthesis  The first total synthesis of gephyrotoxin was performed by Kishi and his co-workers, here they prepped an intermediate from L-pyroglutamic acid in 18 steps. Others have made it to the same intermediate in fewer steps but have included poorly diastereoselective steps. In 2008 Santarem and colleges reported total synthesis of Gephyrotoxin by the obtention of an enantionpure cis-2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidine.

Other members of the Watsons' intellectual circle were actor-directors Gordon Peacock and Thomas Peacocke, both associated with the University of Alberta's Studio Theatre. The Studio Theatre became an important venue for the production of Wilfred Watson's plays, beginning with Cockcrow and the Gulls (which he'd written in the mid-1950s) in March 1962. In the early 1960s Watson co-founded a jazz club, \\"Yardbird Suite\\" in Edmonton. During the same period he became acquainted with Marshall McLuhan and increasingly interested in McLuhan's theories, which resulted in the two men authoring a study, From Cliche to Archetype. The 1960s were Watson's most prolific period for playwriting. Trial of Corporal Adam was produced in 1963; Wail for Two Pedestals in 1964; a centennial play, O Holy Ghost, Dip Your Finger in the Blood of Canada, and Write, I LOVE YOU in 1967; and the satire Let's Murder Clytemnestra According to the Principles of Marshall Mcluhan in 1969. During the 1970s Watson returned to poetry, publishing The Sorrowful Canadians and Other Poems in 1972, I Begin with Counting in 1978, and Mass on Cowback in 1982. In 1983 he wrote a major dramatic work, the trilogy Gramsci x 3, which was produced by Studio Theatre in 1986. He also had a short play, The Woman Taken in Adultery, performed at the Edmonton Fringe Festival in 1987. Wilfred Watson retired in 1977 and moved in 1980 to Nanaimo, British Columbia with his wife Sheila. He died there in 1998 at the age of 87. Writing Watson's first book of poetry, Friday's Child, was accepted by T.S. Eliot and published in 1955 by Faber and Faber. On its appearance, Canadian critic Northrop Frye called it \\"typically formal poetry, mythical, metaphorical and apocalyptic.\\" Frye was admiring: \\"We feel that even a line as breath-taking as 'When in her side my eyes were but blind seeds,' or a phrase like 'the tomb egg broken,' is merely what fits the poem at that point: brilliant as the imagery is, there is no costume jewellery.\\"Northrop Frye, \\"Letters in Canada - 1955,\\" The Bush Garden (Toronto: Anansi, 1971), 46-48. In his second book, The Sorrowful Canadians and Other Poems, published in 1972, Watson experimented with using repetitions and different typefaces. Watson introduced a unique form he called Number-grid Verse in his third book, 1978's I Begin With Counting. The form combines numerals and letters, using \\"a vertical grid of 9 numbers with 17 slots for words, syllables or phrases. By stacking the grids, Watson writes a \\"score\\" for the performance of multivoice poems which exist not on the page but in transformations from visual to auditory forms.\\". Watson used Number- grid Verse in his next book of poetry, Mass on Cowback (1982). The form also allowed him to score poetry for oral performance by several voices, which he used in his later plays. His trilogy Gramsci x 3 is part docudrama, part theatre of the absurd, \\"continual experimentation with verse forms, satire alternating with lyricism, and an energy and exaltation that transcends the horrors it depicts.\\" Recognition Watson's first book of poetry, Friday's Child, won both the British Council and Governor General's Awards for poetry in 1955.

It is native to North America, where it is found in Mexico and in several states in the United States from the Southeast to the Midwest. The species' common name derives from the appearance of its small, rounded red fruits, and the rough half-moon shape of its seeds. Description Cocculus carolinus is a climbing vine reaching 5 meters or more. It produces ovate or triangle-shaped leaves. The male and female flowers are small and green, appearing on different plants. The bright red fruit, a drupe, appears from June to August. It reaches 8 mm in size. Each fruit has a single seed that resembles a small snail shell, protected by the hard endocarp or the inner section of the ovary wall.Cocculus carolinus Flora of North America File:Cocculus carolinus Arkansas.jpgCocculus carolinus with early flowers Distribution This species is native from northern Florida to Mexico, north to North Carolina, Kentucky, southern Illinois and southeast Kansas. Its natural habitat is in rocky woodlands and streamside thickets, particularly in calcareous areas.Cocculus carolinis MissouriPlants It is a weedy species, and can also be found in disturbed habitats such as fencerows and waste areas. Cultivation Seeds The flowers are small, and plentiful. At a young age, Carolina coralbead appear greenish. The seed need cold stratification of 3 months. Seeds germinate in 21‚Äì30 days at 68 ¬∞F. Bloom time for the plant is in late spring and mature by late summer. They grow in tight abundant amounts of bright red berries. By utilizing its scarlet fruits for aesthetic effects, landscapers allow it to be grown on trellises, fences or let naturally flourish through other weeds and shrubs. In the garden setting, this plant can be fast-growing and difficult to eradicate. Chemical components Through photochemical analysis using spectral and mixed-melting comparison, the stems and leaves of Cocculus carolinus were found to contain the following compounds: two cyclitols, (+)quercitol and (‚àí)viburnitol; a lactone, loliolide; and three alkaloids, sinoacutine, magnoflorine, and palmatine.

Hughes in the manufacture of lead chamber sulfuric acid. Since then catalysts have been in use in a large portion of the chemical industry. In the start only pure components were used as catalysts, but after the year 1900 multicomponent catalysts were studied and are now commonly used in the industry.Leach, Bruce. E.,(1983) Industrial Catalysis: Chemistry applied to your life-style and environment, In Applied industrial catalysis, vol 1, New York,Academic press, Inc.Jacobs, G., Davis, B. H.,(2007) Low temperature water-gas shift catalysts, In Catalysis, vol 20, Spivey, J.J and Dooley, K.M (Ed), Cambridge, The royal society of chemistry In the chemical industry and industrial research, catalysis play an important role. Different catalysts are in constant development to fulfil economic, political and environmental demands. When using a catalyst, it is possible to replace a polluting chemical reaction with a more environmentally friendly alternative. Today, and in the future, this can be vital for the chemical industry. In addition, it‚Äôs important for a company/researcher to pay attention to market development. If a company‚Äôs catalyst is not continually improved, another company can make progress in research on that particular catalyst and gain market share. For a company, a new and improved catalyst can be a huge advantage for a competitive manufacturing cost. It‚Äôs extremely expensive for a company to shut down the plant because of an error in the catalyst, so the correct selection of a catalyst or a new improvement can be key to industrial success. To achieve the best understanding and development of a catalyst it is important that different special fields work together. These fields can be: organic chemistry, analytic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, chemical engineers and surface chemistry. The economics must also be taken into account. One of the issues that must be considered is if the company should use money on doing the catalyst research themselves or buy the technology from someone else. As the analytical tools are becoming more advanced, the catalysts used in the industry are improving. One example of an improvement can be to develop a catalyst with a longer lifetime than the previous version. Some of the advantages an improved catalyst gives, that affects people‚Äôs lives, are: cheaper and more effective fuel, new drugs and medications and new polymers. Some of the large chemical processes that use catalysis today are the production of methanol and ammonia. Both methanol and ammonia synthesis take advantage of the water-gas shift reaction and heterogeneous catalysis, while other chemical industries use homogenous catalysis. If the catalyst exists in the same phase as the reactants it is said to be homogenous; otherwise it is heterogeneous.  Water gas shift reaction  The water gas shift reaction was first used industrially at the beginning of the 20th century. Today the WGS reaction is used primarily to produce hydrogen that can be used for further production of methanol and ammonia.Ruettinger, Wolfgang. & Ilinich, Oleg. (2006), Water gas shift reaction, Encyclopedia of chemical processing, Vol 5, Taylor & Francis, 3205-3214 ;WGS reaction: The reaction refers to carbon monoxide (CO) that reacts with water (H2O) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2). The reaction is exothermic with ŒîH -41.1 kJ/mol and have an adiabatic temperature rise of 8‚Äì10 ¬∞C per percent CO converted to CO2 and H2. The most common catalysts used in the water-gas shift reaction are the high temperature shift (HTS) catalyst and the low temperature shift (LTS) catalyst. The HTS catalyst consists of iron oxide stabilized by chromium oxide, while the LTS catalyst is based on copper. The main purpose of the LTS catalyst is to reduce CO content in the reformate which is especially important in the ammonia production for high yield of H2. Both catalysts are necessary for thermal stability, since using the LTS reactor alone increases exit-stream temperatures to unacceptable levels. The equilibrium constant for the reaction is given as: Low temperatures will therefore shift the reaction to the right, and more products will be produced. The equilibrium constant is extremely dependent on the reaction temperature, for example is the Kp equal to 228 at 200 ¬∞C, but only 11.8 at 400 ¬∞C. The WGS reaction can be performed both homogenously and heterogeneously, but only the heterogeneous method is used commercially.  High temperature shift (HTS) catalyst  The first step in the WGS reaction is the high temperature shift which is carried out at temperatures between 320 ¬∞C and 450 ¬∞C. As mentioned before, the catalyst is a composition of iron-oxide, Fe2O3(90-95%), and chromium oxides Cr2O3 (5-10%) which have an ideal activity and selectivity at these temperatures. When preparing this catalyst, one of the most important step is washing to remove sulfate that can turn into hydrogen sulfide and poison the LTS catalyst later in the process. Chromium is added to the catalyst to stabilize the catalyst activity over time and to delay sintering of iron oxide. Sintering will decrease the active catalyst area, so by decreasing the sintering rate the lifetime of the catalyst will be extended. The catalyst is usually used in pellets form, and the size play an important role. Large pellets will be strong, but the reaction rate will be limited. In the end, the dominate phase in the catalyst consist of Cr3+ in Œ±-Fe2O3 but the catalyst is still not active. To be active Œ±-Fe2O3 must be reduced to Fe and CrO3 must be reduced to Cr in presence of H2. This usually happens in the reactor start-up phase and because the reduction reactions are exothermic the reduction should happen under controlled circumstances. The lifetime of the iron-chrome catalyst is approximately 3‚Äì5 years, depending on how the catalyst is handled. Even though the mechanism for the HTS catalyst has been done a lot of research on, there is no final agreement on the kinetics/mechanism. Research has narrowed it down to two possible mechanisms: a regenerative redox mechanism and an adsorptive(associative) mechanism. The redox mechanism is given below: First a CO molecule reduces an O molecule, yielding CO2 and a vacant surface center: The vacant side is then reoxidized by water, and the oxide center is regenerated: The adsorptive mechanism assumes that format species is produced when an adsorbed CO molecule reacts with a surface hydroxyl group: The format decomposes then in the presence of steam:  Low temperature shift (LTS) catalyst  The low temperature process is the second stage in the process, and is designed to take advantage of higher hydrogen equilibrium at low temperatures. The reaction is carried out between 200 ¬∞C and 250 ¬∞C, and the most commonly used catalyst is based on copper. While the HTS reactor used an iron-chrome based catalyst, the copper-catalyst is more active at lower temperatures thereby yielding a lower equilibrium concentration of CO and a higher equilibrium concentration of H2. The disadvantage with a copper catalysts is that it is very sensitive when it comes to sulfide poisoning, a future use of for example a cobalt- molybdenum catalyst could solve this problem. The catalyst mainly used in the industry today is a copper-zinc- alumina (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) based catalyst. Also the LTS catalyst has to be activated by reduction before it can be used. The reduction reaction CuO + H2 ‚ÜíCu + H2O is highly exothermic and should be conducted in dry gas for an optimal result. As for the HTS catalyst mechanism, two similar reaction mechanisms are suggested. The first mechanism that was proposed for the LTS reaction was a redox mechanism, but later evidence showed that the reaction can proceed via associated intermediates. The different intermediates that is suggested are: HOCO, HCO and HCOO. In 2009Tang, Qian-Lin ., Chen, Zhao-Xu ., & He, Xiang. (2009). A theoretical study of the water gas shift reaction mechanism on Cu(111) model system, Surface science, Elsevier, 603:2138-2144 there are in total three mechanisms that are proposed for the water-gas shift reaction over Cu(111), given below. Intermediate mechanism (usually called associative mechanism): An intermediate is first formed and then decomposes into the final products: Associative mechanism: CO2 produced from the reaction of CO with OH without the formation of an intermediate: Redox mechanism: Water dissociation that yields surface oxygen atoms which react with CO to produce CO2: It is not said that just one of these mechanisms is controlling the reaction, it is possible that several of them are active. Q.-L. Tang et al. has suggested that the most favorable mechanism is the intermediate mechanism (with HOCO as intermediate) followed by the redox mechanism with the rate determining step being the water dissociation. For both HTS catalyst and LTS catalyst the redox mechanism is the oldest theory and most published articles support this theory, but as technology has developed the adsorptive mechanism has become more of interest. One of the reasons to the fact that the literature is not agreeing on one mechanism can be because of experiments are carried out under different assumptions.  Carbon Monoxide  CO must be produced for the WGS reaction to take place. This can be done in different ways from a variety of carbon sources such as: Haynes, A., Maitlis, P.M., (2006) Syntheses based on carbon monoxide,In Metal- catalysis in industrial organic processes, Chiusoli, G.P. and Maitlis, P.M. (Ed), Cambridge, The royal society of chemistry * passing steam over coal: * steam reforming methane, over a nickel catalyst: * or by using biomass. Both the reactions shown above are highly endothermic and can be coupled to an exothermic partial oxidation. The products of CO and H2 are known as syngas. When dealing with a catalyst and CO, it is common to assume that the intermediate CO-Metal is formed before the intermediate reacts further into the products. When designing a catalyst this is important to remember. The strength of interaction between the CO molecule and the metal should be strong enough to provide a sufficient concentration of the intermediate, but not so strong that the reaction will not continue. CO is a common molecule to use in a catalytic reaction, and when it interacts with a metal surface it is actually the molecular orbitals of CO that interacts with the d-band of the metal surface. When considering a molecular orbital(MO)-diagram CO can act as an œÉ-donor via the lone pair of the electrons on C, and a œÄ-acceptor ligand in transition metal complexes. When a CO molecule is adsorbed on a metal surface, the d-band of the metal will interact with the molecular orbitals of CO. It is possible to look at a simplified picture, and only consider the LUMO (2œÄ*) and HOMO (5œÉ) to CO. The overall effect of the œÉ-donation and the œÄ- back donation is that a strong bond between C and the metal is being formed and in addition the bond between C and O will be weakened. The latter effect is due to charge depletion of the CO 5œÉ bonding and charge increase of the CO 2œÄ* antibonding orbital.Somorjai, G. A., Li, (2010) Y. Introduction to surface chemistry and catalysis, 2nd ed, 2010, John Wiley & Sons Inc. When looking at chemical surfaces, many researchers seems to agree on that the surface of the Cu/Al2O3/ZnO is most similar to the Cu(111) surface.Nakamura, Junji., Campbell, Joseph M., & Campbell,Charles T. (1990).Kinetics and Mechanism of the water-gas shift reaction catalyzed by the clean and Cs-promoted Cu(110) Surface: A comparison with Cu(111). J.Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 86:2725-2734 Since copper is the main catalyst and the active phase in the LTS catalyst, many experiments has been done with copper. In the figure given here experiments has been done on Cu(110) and Cu(111). The figure shows Arrhenius plot derived from reaction rates. It can be seen from the figure that Cu(110) shows a faster reaction rate and a lower activation energy. This can be due to the fact that Cu(111) is more closely packed than Cu(110). Methanol production Production of methanol is an important industry today and methanol is one of the largest volume carbonylation products. The process uses syngas as feedstock and for that reason the water gas shift reaction is important for this synthesis. The most important reaction based on methanol is the decomposition of methanol to yield carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Methanol is therefore an important raw material for production of CO and H2 that can be used in generation of fuel. Marschner, F., Moeller, F.M., (1983) Methanol synthesis, In Applied industrial catalysis, vol 2, Leach, B.E (Ed), New York, Acasamic press Inc BASF was the first company (in 1923) to produce methanol on large-scale, then using a sulfur-resistant ZnO/Cr2O3 catalyst. The feed gas was produced by gasification over coal. Today the synthesis gas is usually manufactured via steam reforming of natural gas. The most effective catalysts for methanol synthesis are Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt, while the most common metals used for support are Al and Si. In 1966 ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) developed a process that is still in use today. The process is a low-pressure process that uses a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst where copper is the active material. This catalyst is actually the same that the low-temperature shift catalyst in the WGS reaction is using. The reaction described below is carried out at 250 ¬∞C and 5-10 MPa: Both of these reactions are exothermic and proceeds with volume contraction. Maximum yield of methanol is therefore obtained at low temperatures and high pressure and with use of a catalyst that has a high activity at these conditions. A catalyst with sufficiently high activity at the low temperature does still not exist, and this is one of the main reasons that companies keep doing research and catalyst development.Agrell, J., Lindstr√∂m, B., Petterson, L.J., J√§r√•s, S.G, (2002),Catalytic hydrogen generation from Methanol, In Catalyisis, vol 16, Spivey, J.J (Ed), Cambridge, The royal society of chemistry. A reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis has been suggested by Chinchen et al.:Chinchen, G. C., Mansfield, K., Spencer, M.S., CHEMTECH, 1990, 20, 692. Today there are four different ways to catalytically obtain hydrogen production from methanol, and all reactions can be carried out by using a transition metal catalyst (Cu, Pd):  Steam reforming  The reaction is given as: Steam reforming is a good source for production of hydrogen, but the reaction is endothermic. The reaction can be carried out over a copper-based catalyst, but the reaction mechanism is dependent on the catalyst. For a copper-based catalyst two different reaction mechanisms have been proposed, a decomposition-water-gas shift sequence and a mechanism that proceeds via methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate. The first mechanism aims at methanol decomposition followed by the WGS reaction and has been proposed for the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3: The mechanism for the methyl format reaction can be dependent of the composition of the catalyst. The following mechanism has been proposed over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3: When methanol is almost completely converted CO is being produced as a secondary product via the reverse water-gas shift reaction.  Methanol decomposition  The second way to produce hydrogen from methanol is by methanol decomposition: As the enthalpy shows, the reaction is endothermic and this can be taken further advantage of in the industry. This reaction is the opposite of the methanol synthesis from syngas, and the most effective catalysts seems to be Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt as mentioned before. Often, a Cu/ZnO-based catalyst is used at temperatures between 200 and 300 ¬∞C but a production of by-product as dimethyl ether, methyl format, methane and water is common. The reaction mechanism is not fully understood and there are two possible mechanism proposed (2002) : one producing CO2 and H2 by decomposition of formate intermediates and the other producing CO and H2 via a methyl formate intermediate.  Partial oxidation  Partial oxidation is a third way for producing hydrogen from methanol. The reaction is given below, and is often carried out with air or oxygen as oxidant : The reaction is exothermic and has, under favorable conditions, a higher reaction rate than steam reforming. The catalyst used is often Cu (Cu/ZnO) or Pd and they differ in qualities such as by-product formation, product distribution and the effect of oxygen partial pressure.  Combined reforming  Combined reforming is a combination of partial oxidation and steam reforming and is the last reaction that is used for hydrogen production. The general equation is given below: and are the stoichiometric coefficients for steam reforming and partial oxidation, respectively. The reaction can be both endothermic and exothermic determined by the conditions, and combine both the advantages of steam reforming and partial oxidation.  Ammonia synthesis  Ammonia synthesis was discovered by Fritz Haber, by using iron catalysts. The ammonia synthesis advanced between 1909 and 1913, and two important concepts were developed; the benefits of a promoter and the poisoning effect (see catalysis for more details).Merriam, J. S., Atwood, K., (1984) \\"Ammonia synthesis catalysts in industrial practice\\", In Applied Industrial Catalysis, Leach, B. E. (Ed), vol 3, Orlando, Academic Press Inc. Ammonia production was one of the first commercial processes that required the production of hydrogen, and the cheapest and best way to obtain hydrogen was via the water-gas shift reaction. The Haber‚ÄìBosch process is the most common process used in the ammonia industry. A lot of research has been done on the catalyst used in the ammonia process, but the main catalyst that is used today is not that dissimilar to the one that was first developed. The catalyst the industry use is a promoted iron catalyst, where the promoters can be K2O (potassium oxide), Al2O3 (aluminium oxide) and CaO (calcium oxide) and the basic catalytic material is Fe. The most common is to use fixed bed reactors for the synthesis catalyst. The main ammonia reaction is given below: The produced ammonia can be used further in production of nitric acid via the Ostwald process.

This was not within his rights to do so since that type of appointment could only be made by the king or his representative. Nevertheless, he created 39 notarial acts in his time in the New World. Four more notaries who followed Bermen in the post acted on his precedent and used the title. They were: Claude Lecoustre (1647‚Äì1648), Guillaume Audouart (1649‚Äì1663), Jean Durand (1653‚Äì1654) and Louis Rouer de Villeray (1653‚Äì1657). None legally held the title. Bermen would have fallen under the authority of the Company of One Hundred Associates (Compagnie des Cent-Associ√©s) in regards to his work as a notary.

Lotz, the multi-channel transition began in the early 1980s and lasted about 20 years. Many changes happened during this transition such as the invention of the remote control, the video cassette player, and analog cable systems expanded viewer's choice and control. This era gave viewers more choice and control over what and when they wanted to view a program. Viewers were able to defy the networks' schedules, because they could record the program and watch it whenever they wanted, using the VCR and later the DVR. Producers adjusted to the government regulations and networks were forced to give up some of the control they had over program creation. Subscription channels emerged with no advertisements and the method for measuring audiences grew with the Nielsen People Meter.  Background  New broadcast networks emerged such as Fox in 1986, The WB in 1995 and the UPN in 1995 and all added great competition to the original networks, NBC, ABC, and CBS. The percentage of people who watched network television dropped from 90% to 64% in the 1980s. During the 1990s, in spite of the new broadcast competitors, viewers carried on to switch from prime time viewing to cable, even though the rate wasn't as high as before. Still, broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, The WB, and UPN) gathered an average of only 58 percent of those watching television at the end of the 1999-2000 season, and only 46 percent in the final of the 2004-2005 season.Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) \\"The Television Will Be Revolutionized\\". New York, NY: New York University Press The remote control became standard on most television sets in the 1980s and that helped the viewers break away from the network era. The VCR further helped viewers to break away from the network era by enabling them to record a program and view it when they wanted to. The VCR also allowed people to build personal libraries. All of these new technologies allowed the viewer greater choice and control over specific media. The emergence of so many new networks and channels changed the type of programming produced in order to gain more ratings points. Producers and advertisers were now able to target specific people and appeal to a narrower group. The variety show genre, in particular, was made obsolete by the change; none has lasted more than a single season since 1991, and the genre remains one of the least frequently seen in reruns. The ability for cable channels to succeed with smaller audiences made broadcasters' mission more difficult, because viewers now had the option to choose which program would satisfy their needs. Even though cable was readily available, that didn't mean that the viewer would receive every channel they wanted. Cable was then broken down into separate tiers and cable companies offered different packages for different geographic areas. Cable allowed viewers to have special interest in certain programs. The viewers found what channels or shows they liked best once cable was introduced. During the network era there were only three networks NBC, ABC, and CBS. With the multi- channel transition production companies now had the upper hand with more networks to buy their shows. Where once the networks had control the production companies now held control. In order to maintain their own viability, the major networks lobbied the FCC to repeal the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had separated syndicators from networks in 1971; the FCC obliged in 1991, allowing more vertical integration. New distribution during the multi-channel transition During the multi-channel transition, distribution windows expanded to include cable networks, direct sale on VCR tapes, and then DVD and VOD (Video On Demand). More recently they have also come to encompass Internet websites, where episodes can be downloaded or streamed. There has been such a high growing variety of ways for networks to reach viewers, which has also decreased some of the risk of unconventional programs, because new distribution routes provide opportunities to make money on shows that fail to achieve high ratings during network runs. Internet distribution also provides a venue for additional and supplemental programming. Before the multi-channel transition, only signals broadcast over the air could be received on television in the home. Later, a range of possibilities developed. Cable television and satellite television became common mechanisms of delivery, and companies such as AT&T; and Verizon also joined the competition of distribution during the mid-2000s. In 2006, broadband internet distribution of video became overwhelmingly popular, which diminished the domination of cable and satellite as the only source for most channels to be able to reach the home.

He joined the army in 1770 as an Ensign in the 55th Foot, and was promoted Lieutenant in September 1773. He served in North America with his brother from 1775, seeing action in the American War of Independence and was elevated to Captain of the 55th Foot in November 1777. Under Rawdon he served at the Battle of Camden, 25 April 1781, after leading a small force to raid Snow Island in March. He sailed back to Great Britain with his brother and Rawdon later that year, but was captured en route by the French fleet, to be later exchanged. He was appointed Lieutenant- Colonel of the 105th Foot (former \\"Volunteers of Ireland\\") in March 1782, but placed on half-pay after the peace. He was Military Envoy to Poland and Warsaw during the 1780s. Doyle was made Lieutenant-Colonel of the 14th Foot in March 1789, and commanded the regiment in the Flanders Campaign under the Duke of York in 1793. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Famars 22 May by leading an attack on an entrenched camp. After an initial rebuff from a French force that could be heard playing the patriotic march \\"√áa Ira\\" to urge on its men, Doyle ordered his own men to strike up the same tune, saying \\"We'll beat them to their own damned tune\\". The position was taken and the 14th Foot were ordered by York to henceforth use \\"√áa Ira\\" as their marching tune in honour of the occasion. Doyle was appointed Brigadier-General in November 1794, and promoted Major-General in February 1795. After the evacuation from Holland he joined the Royalist survivors of Quiberon at the √éle d'Yeu with 4 British foot regiments and 3 Royalist cavalry units from September, commanding the total 5,000 men. He commanded the attack on Hedic and Houat in August. Eventually this force was obliged to withdraw due to serious supply problems after the failure of the Vendeans to raise support. Doyle was Colonel of the 53rd (Shropshire) Regiment of Foot from November 1796 ‚Äì January 1798. He was then dispatched to India, spending some time at the Cape of Good Hope in 1796.

The series consists of three books: Fever Crumb (2009), A Web of Air (2010), and Scrivener's Moon (2011). The books follow a young woman known as Fever Crumb, and her adventures set around the time of the creation of the first traction cities that become so prevalent in the Mortal Engines series. Reeve stated in 2011 that he had always envisaged a quartet for the series, assuring readers of a fourth instalment. In March 2020, he said that \\"too much time has passed\\" making it difficult to revisit the series, and that he did not intend to finish and publish a fourth book. Setting The series is set in the distant future, thousands of years after the Earth was ravaged by a nuclear conflict called the Sixty Minute War, which almost destroyed civilization, leaving only bare remnants. Unlike in Mortal Engines, the effects of this war can still be felt, as several mutant species were created by the fallout, including a quasi-sentient race of seagulls, known as \\"Angels\\", and a new race of Woolly Mammoth creatures that are seemingly explained by a throwback caused by excessive radiation. The humanoid \\"Scriven\\" race, practically extinct in the later work, are at first thought to also be mutants. It is later discovered that their creation was deliberate, with the longer lifespans and more resilient systems included in the Scriven design intended for the preservation of the human race in the harsh postwar conditions. The world has become geologically unstable, with vast natural disasters. Large land barges feature prominently as smaller predecessors to the subsequent vehicles. A war has been raging between the Nomads; this conflict is partially created by Land Admiral Nikola Quercus (later Nicholas Quirke), employing the theories of Auric Godshawk (a deceased Scriven scientist) to build a moving city. Plot summary Before the events of series, the post-apocalyptic city of London is ruled by an evolved species of human called the scriven. In the final years of the scriven rule, Dr. Gideon Crumb, a human engineer, falls in love with Wavey Godshawk, a scriven and the daughter of the London's ruler, Auric Godshawk. In a violent uprising known as the 'Skinner's riots', Auric and many other scriven are killed in an act of genocide by the human citizens of London. Wavey, who lacks most of the distinctive markings of the scriven, escapes with her newborn half-human baby, but then leaves her child with a friend who passes her onto Gideon along with a note saying 'Her name is Fever'. Wavey then flees across the country where she runs into a carnival run by a dwarf named Borglum. For several years she lives in peace with the carnival's staff, working on engines and building machines. With Wavey gone into hiding, Gideon raises his Fever as an adopted child in the engineerium for many years, until the twists and turns of fate forced him to explain the truth to her. Fever leaves London to join the Lyceum, a traveling theatre with children whom she took care of after their father was murdered, where she starts growing out her previously close-cropped hair and begins to loosen up. She meets Arlo Thursday, an orphan boy who becomes her first love. Arlo had fallen in love with a girl named Thirza Blaizey, but she rejects him to marry the rich and powerful Jago Belkin. Although Arlo is originally distrusting towards Fever, (pointing a gun at her,) they grow close enough for Arlo to unveil his plans of the world's first Aeroplane. Fever ends up fleeing along with Arlo after her life is threatened by unknown assailants. They retreat to Thursday Island and begin to construct Arlo's invention using wood and paper and an engine sent to him by another inventor, however this proves to be too heavy and so Fever puts her engineering talents to good use and improvises by cannibalizing a power supply and motor from a Stalker-Crab type creature which was built by Auric Godshawk and given to Arlo's family as a gift. As the Aeroplane nears completion, Thursday Island is besieged by Jago Belkin, who has learned of Arlo's plan from Thirza, who enticed the information from Arlo's best friend and Angel, Weasel, before murdering him. Jago is accompanied by a legion of soldiers (The London engineer Dr Teal also shows up after the initial assault), who corner Arlo and Fever in a derelict tower where the Aeroplane is kept. Jago is killed in the final confrontation which leads to Fever successfully flying the world's first Aeroplane for several minutes before it plummets into the sea. Fever and Arlo are picked up by Wavey Godshawk and Dr. Crumb, Fever's parents, who persuade Fever to forget about the dreams of flight which she shared with Arlo and return to London, which is in the process of transforming into the first Traction City. Fever saves Arlo's life, but in doing so she is forced to betray him and his research. Breaking Fever's heart, Arlo sails away from Mayda and the Thursday Island, never to return. She leaves the Traveling Circus to work with Nicola Quercus and the Nomads, returning to London where she reconciles with Wavey and Gideon as the new London was built. Gideon becomes an important part of the engineering team behind the first Traction City, and lives happily with his lover and his daughter for a while. Borglum and his circus return to London, where they tell Wavey and Fever of a great pyramid from the Ancient times that has recently broken open in an earthquake. Wavey, Fever, and Borglum set off to the North to investigate the pyramid properly. They are imprisoned by the Northern Nomad Rufus Raven. Wavey and Fever escape, but Wavey is brutally killed by a stalker (possibly Shrike/ Grike) while making sure that Fever escapes unharmed. Her death has a profound effect on the other characters, triggering Gideon Crumb's transformation into an antagonist, influencing Fever's journey into emotional acceptance of herself and leading Borglum into a terroristic strike against Raven, which in turn radically influences the outcome of the battle between the Nomads and the first traction city. Fever meets Cluny Morvish, a Nomadic girl who she falls in love with, making her the first confirmed bisexual character in either series (although Sathya is referred to as being in love with Anna Fang at one point, it is uncertain what exactly this means and could easily refer to platonic love.) She leaves London behind for good after seeing what Quercus and her father have turned it into, settling into a more peaceful life with her girlfriend Cluny. The news of Wavey's death has a devastating impact on Dr Crumb ‚Äì however, instead of grieving, he retreats into the protection of pure rationality while disposing of the potentially very painful emotions that humanised him. He becomes head engineer in Wavey's place, which leads him down a road of cold, emotionless insanity until he has become completely inhuman. He reaches a turning point when he is informed halfway through London's completion that the city must move within weeks to avoid the onrushing army of nomads. In response, he concocts a 'rational' plan which involves not building most of the housing that had been planned on this new city and only taking the most 'useful' people on board London, leaving the others to die. Even when Fever returns relatively unharmed from the North, he has become so cold that he cannot love her and considers leaving her behind when he sees that she has abandoned rationality for love. Characters As with the Mortal Engines Quartet, a handful number of the people in the books are named after places in Devon, where Reeve lives, including Chudleigh, Tamerton Foliot and the River Plym. In the quartet, Miss Plym and Chudleigh Pomeroy are both in the Guild of Historians, and Tamarton Foliot is an \\"Alternative\\" historian. Both Shrike and Smew are named after birds, and Pennyroyal is named after a flower. Many of the characters are named after ancient (in the context of the books) brands: Windolene Pye, Daz Gravy, Nutella Eisberg, Napster Varley, and Nabisco Shkin for example. Friends of Phillip Reeve are also occasionally mentioned in the books as characters; for instance 'Poskitt' is included as a god, clearly referring to Kjartan Poskitt, a friend and the author of books that Reeve has illustrated in the past. * Fever Crumb ‚Äì The main protagonist of the series and child of Wavey Godshawk (the last of the human hybrid 'Scriven race') and engineer Dr. Gideon Crumb, the latter of which raised her amongst the London Engineers. She is portrayed as highly intelligent yet socially inept, and driven by rationality to a near zealous extent. As the series progresses however, her interactions with other cultures and societies outside of London lead her to become more open with her emotions. Fever is also plagued with seemingly random visions of her dead grandfather, Auric Godshawk, the former Scriven ruler of London. It is later revealed that the visions are caused by Stalker nanomachines that were implanted in her brain by Auric to preserve his memories. Physically, Fever is described as being shaven-headed with subtle Scriven features and heterochromia eyes. After the first book in the series, she decides to grow her fair coloured hair longer, scraping it backwards into a tight bun. She is bisexual, and falls in love with Arlo Thursday in A Web of Air, but later forms a romantic relationship with Cluny Morvish in Scrivener's Moon and the two eventually settle into a new life with each other. * Auric Godshawk ‚Äì Before the events of Fever Crumb Auric Godshawk was the last Scriven ruler of London before the Skinner's Guild staged a coup and murdered him and the rest of his kind. He was an ambitious man driven by science, and his fascination with advanced pre-war technology led him to conceive the idea of traction cities. Even with his murder at the hands of the Skinners, his daughter, Wavey Godshawk, continued to develop the traction city concept with the aid of northern nomad, Nicola Quercus. Many of the events in the series revolve around Auric's legacy and the impact it has on Fever's life. * Wavey Godshawk ‚Äì Fever Crumb's mother and the last known Scriven alive. She was the daughter of Auric Godshawk, and lived a wealthy lifestyle until an anti- Scriven uprising resulted in the genocide of her race and forced her to flee London. She would return to the city years later with her father's research, and the assistance and funding of Nicola Quercus, to continue developing the idea of a mobile traction city. * Gideon Crumb ‚Äì Fever Crumb's father, and a prominent member of the London Engineers. Before the genocide of the Scriven, Gideon worked as Auric Godshawk's apprentice. Despite his rational and logic driven personality, Gideon fell deeply in love with Auric's daughter, Wavey, and the two of them conceived Fever. After the uprising, Wavey went missing and Gideon raised his daughter amongst the engineers, while concealing the true nature of her identity from everyone including Fever herself. *Arlo Thursday ‚Äì A young inventor and the only survivor of a tsunami that killed his entire family on their own island. Arlo remained on the island for several months with only the company of a local flock of mutated birds, known as Angels. He was eventually rescued and taken to the nearby harbour city of Mayda, built inside an old crater located off the coast of Portugal. From there he was apprenticed to a shipwright named Blaizey, who was also the business rival of Arlo's father, before the great wave. His one true goal in life is to build a machine capable of flight, much to the bemusement of the citizens of Mayda. He is introduced in A Web of Air. * Kit Solent/Shrike ‚Äì Featured heavily in the original Mortal Engines Quartet as the infamous stalker, Shrike. Before his transformation, Solent was an archaeologist living in London and a caring father of two children. He takes on Fever Crumb as his apprentice in the hope that she can help him uncover the secrets of a mysterious locked door, deep in the catacombs beneath the city. * Charley Shallow ‚Äì A conflicted and morally ambiguous young boy who originally worked as an apprentice to Bagman Creech, an old Skinner. He is later taken into the Guild of Engineers and works as an apprentice for Gideon Crumb. While Charley is portrayed as being meek and easily manipulated early in the series, by Scrivener's Moon he is shown to be much more confident and ambitious, and even begins to manipulate others for his own needs. He shows bouts of both heroism and villainy, but often chooses the easier and more self-serving path. Charley is introduced in Fever Crumb. * Cluny Morvish ‚Äì The daughter of a minor nobleman in the nomadic Arkangelsk Empire. She is constantly troubled by visions of London becoming an all-devouring mobile city. While her dreams are interpreted by technomancer Nintendo Tharp as a warning from \\"the Ancestors\\", it is later revealed that Cluny was a victim of the same experiments conducted by Auric Godshawk on Fever. Under Tharp's strict tutelage Cluny becomes a prophet, a role that soon promotes a campaign against London aided by the warring empires of the north. She develops an intimate and romantic relationship with Fever. Cluny is introduced in Scrivener's Moon. * Nicola Quercus ‚Äì A northerner and land admiral of a nomadic organization known as The Movement. He is a pioneering ruler who assists Wavey Godshawk in the development of the first Traction City. In the Mortal Engines Quartet he is widely considered to be the founder and mind behind the concept of Municipal Darwinism and the traction cities, while in fact the idea was originally conceived by Auric Godshawk.

Sterling (Bryan Bruno Sterling, January 27, 1922 ‚Äì March 13, 2008) was an authority on the life and work of American political commentator, humorist, and entertainer Will Rogers. He scripted and co-produced \\"Will Rogers' USA,\\" a one-man Broadway play about Rogers starring actor James Whitmore, created a daily syndicated newspaper column that featured timely quotations from Rogers' writings, and authored several definitive biographies of Rogers' life including a detailed examination of his death in the Point Barrow, Alaska, crash of an airplane piloted by famed aviator Wiley Post.  Early life  Born Bruno Zwerling in Vienna, Austria, in 1922, Sterling and his family fled the Anschluss (Nazi occupation) in 1938 to Czechoslovakia. Bruno then flew from Prague to England on a student visa. His parents, Hermann and Klara ZwerlingThe Young Victims of the Nazi Regime: Migration, the Holocaust and Postwar Displacement, by Simone Gigliotti, Monica Tempian. Bloombury, 2016 later joined him in England after obtaining visas to Italy, France and England under the sponsorship of his father's brother to be a butler and cook. Bryan was relocated by the British, when they went to war in 1939, as an enemy alien interned to a prisoner of war camp in Sherbrooke in Canada. His father Hermann Zwerling was later interned at the Isle of Man, where he died of pneumonia; Bryan never saw him again. While at the camp, he shared quarters with the famous nuclear spy Klaus Fuchs. Sterling moved to Toronto after his release on November 17, 1942. There he met and (in 1949) married Frances Wingerson, who later collaborated with him on research and coauthored several of his books.  Career  Born in Europe and imprisoned in Canada during World War II, Sterling never encountered Will Rogers during the humorist's lifetime. After relocating to New York City in 1948, Sterling began hearing quotations from Rogers, and was attracted to the way his wit and commentary transcended time and culture. Sometime in the early 1960s, he discovered audio recordings of radio broadcasts and speeches by Rogers, which he gained permission to publish as LP records. These were released under the private label \\"Distinguished Recordings.\\" Sterling began to amass Rogers writings and memorabilia, and in 1970 co-produced and wrote much of the script for \\"Will Rogers' USA,\\" a one-man Broadway play that starred actor James Whitmore. It was performed in various venues by Whitmore until 2000, and appeared on television in 1972. In 1974, Sterling launched \\"Will Rogers Says,\\" a daily column syndicated by the Des Moines Register and Tribune that matched brief quotations from Rogers' earlier writings to current political events. \\"When people read Will Rogers,\\" he told Time magazine, \\"they realize that much of what we are going through has happened before, that we've already lived through this.\\" Over the following three decades, Sterling created and referred to the largest private collection of writings and information by and about Will Rogers in the United States. Rogers' son, Will Rogers, Jr., reportedly said that Sterling knew his father's writings better than anyone else. Sterling and his wife Frances traveled often from New York to the Will Rogers Memorial in Claremore, Oklahoma, and to California, to carry out research about Rogers' life, becoming close to surviving members of the Rogers family and interviewing many of the entertainment figures who worked with Rogers in Hollywood. The results of this primary research appear in Sterling's many biographies of Rogers and published compilations of his writings. The original interview tapes and notes are archived at the Will Rogers Memorial in Oklahoma. Sterling died on March 13, 2008 in New York City, leaving behind what Will Rogers Memorial Director Steve Gragert, speaking at his funeral, described as \\"a collection of writings that cannot be replaced, one that anyone ... can consult with confidence and pleasure.\\" Awards and honors *Western Heritage Award, 1983, for A Will Rogers Treasury *Will Rogers Communicator Award, 1997  Books  *The Best of Will Rogers (1979) *A Will Rogers Treasury (1982) *Will Rogers in Hollywood (1984) *Will Rogers' World (1989) *Will Rogers & Wiley Post: Death at Barrow (1993) *Will Rogers Speaks (1995) *Will Rogers: A Photobiography (1999) *Forgotten Eagle: Wiley Post, America's Forgotten Aviation Pioneer (2001) *The Wit & Wisdom of Will Rogers (2009; posthumous)  References  * Sterling, access date 4 May 2011 Category:Austrian emigrants to the United States Category:1922 births Category:2008 deaths Category:20th-century American biographers ","title":"Bryan Sterling"},{"id":"31586191","text":"The Dana/Spicer Model 30 is an automotive axle manufactured by Dana Holding Corporation.

It could grow as large as a ferret, and lived in the Miocene, . The reason for its name, which means \\"Hammer Biter\\", is because it has blunt, hammer like teeth, not known from any other mammal extant or extinct. However, Scott Hocknull from the Queensland Museum has noticed similarities to the modern pink-tongued skink (Cyclodomorphus gerrardii), a reptile specialised for eating snails. This suggests that Malleodectes too was a specialised snail hunter.  Taxonomy  The description of new taxa, genus and two species, was published in 2011, based on fossilised type material discovered at a Riversleigh site. The type species is named Malleodectes mirabilis and the second description published as Malleodectes moenia; their generic epithet combines terms derived from the Latin, malleo meaning hammer, and Ancient Greek, dectes for biter, in reference to the unusual dentition. Malleodectes was reclassified as the sole genus of Malleodectidae in a 2016 revision, with the family allied to Dasyuromorphia. The arrangement published in 2016 may be summarised as, * Order Dasyuromorphia (thylacinid, dasyurid, and Myrmecobius families) :* Family Malleodectidae ::* Genus Malleodectes :::* Species Malleodectes mirabilis :::* Species Malleodectes moenia A fossil species of opossum uncovered in excavations in Brazil has been proposed as a sister taxon to the genus, and that its genus Gaylordia could be placed with the same family.  Description  A marsupial with highly specialised dentition, an enlarged premolar with a flattened profile used to hammer open the shells of snails found in its wet forested environment. This tooth was compared by the authors to a genus of skinks, Cyclodomorphus, and concluded this represented evolutionary convergence with the modern skinks that have similar adaptation to their diet of snails; the authors gave a generalised description of this unusual animal as a \\"marsupial-skink\\". A leading author on the research and description of the species, professor Michael Archer, said of the type species, \\"Malleodectes mirabilis was a bizarre mammal, as strange in its own way as a koala or kangaroo ‚Ä¶,\\". Fossil material associated with genus had been collected by workers at Riversleigh in the years leading to the crucial discovery of a juvenile jaw containing unerupted adult teeth. The juvenile specimen was found at a cave floor deposit with the remains of other animals, the AL90 site, and postulated to have fallen from its mother into a cave that once existed in the limestone formation.

History The present structure was built in 1886 on a site that had been dedicated to theatre since 1817. Architect Charles Peigniet, who helped to create of the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty in New York, designed the building. From 1930 to 1943, Gaston Baty directed the theatre, and as a result, it became known as the Th√©√¢tre Montparnasse-Gaston Baty. From 1944 to 1964, actress Margaret Jamois directed the theatre. In 1965, Lars Schmidt bought the theatre and appointed Jerome Hullot artistic director. Schmidt and Hullot introduced many English talents to the French stage, including such authors and actors as Harold Pinter, Peter Shaffer, No√´l Coward, Arnold Wesker, and Murray Schisgal. In 1979, they created the Petit Montparnasse theatre on the site of a former warehouse. In 1984, Schmidt retired, and Myriam Colombi succeeded him, renovating the theatre and adding a bar-restaurant. The current capacity of the main theatre is seven hundred and fifteen seats. In 1998, renovation and expansion of the Petit Montparnasse began, and it became a hall with two hundred seats, finally reopening in November 2003.

Zell, Carol Bundy & Virginia Coulon (eds), A New Reader's Guide to African Literature, Heinemann Educational Books, 1983, pp. 410-11. His early plays, initially produced on the BBC African Service, were published as Obasai and Other Plays (1968). In the mid-1960s he lived in Denmark, where a book of his poetry, Ny afrikansk prosa, was published (1969). On his return to Sierra Leone in 1968 Maddy became Head of Drama on Radio Sierra Leone. He was a founder-director of the theatre company Gbakanda Afrikan Tiata, founded 1969 in Freetown. He subsequently worked in Zambia, where he directed the national dance troupe and trained them for the Montreal World's Fair in 1970. He also taught drama in Nigeria, at the University of Ibadan and the University of Ilorin, and in the United States. His first novel, No Past, No Present, No Future, explored the dynamics of a group of three friends (including, controversially, at the time, one gay man) growing up in colonial West Africa and their physical, psychological and emotional journeys to Europe. It was published in 1973, to great acclaim in the Heinemann African Writers Series, and his writing continued to develop. His work, which is often challenging and confrontational, has been broadcast by the BBC and published internationally. However, the uncompromising honesty of his writing, particularly in his views on the social and political inequalities in Africa, led to his political imprisonment in Sierra Leone. Upon his release, he was forced to leave the country and become a political exile. In 2007, Maddy returned to Sierra Leone to teach at Freetown‚Äôs Milton Margai College of Education and continue his academic research of exploring and developing Sierra Leone‚Äôs cultural heritage, providing inspiration and opportunities to a new generation of artists and performers, and continuing to give a \\"voice to the voiceless\\" through the work of his Gbakanda Foundation.Gbakanda Foundation. After a long period of illness, he died in March 2014, aged 78, at Choitram Hospital, Freetown.

Many experts believe that fertilizer subsidies represent an essential method for achieving long term food security in Sub-Saharan Africa, while providing social support to Africa's poorest subsistence farmers. Yet previous universal subsidy schemes enjoyed only moderate success, raising concerns about whether the market distortions subsidies introduce can ever lead to a sustainable agricultural system. New practices in creating more targeted subsidies may be the key to achieving durable success. Rationale Despite the potential benefits to crop yields, inorganic fertilizer application in Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other developing regions. Average application in Sub-Saharan Africa is less than 10 kg per hectare, while the average application in Latin America and South Asia is nearly 140 kg per hectare. Sub-optimal or inefficient fertilizer use may result from farmers‚Äô incomplete knowledge of its benefits or proper application techniques, inadequate (liquid) funds, or aversion to the risk associated with investing in a new input. Proponents of subsidies argue that they can help to mitigate these circumstances and bring fertilizer use up to optimal levels. The implementation of subsidy programs may also be argued for equity reasons. Like other forms of social support (health, education spending) subsidies represent a redistribution of funds within a society, and can be an effective way to target subsistence farmers (a disproportionately large amount of Sub- Saharan Africa's poor). Finally, subsidies may also create positive externalities, such as decreased soil erosion from increased plant growth. These external benefits may cause fertilizer to be undervalued in the market transaction, and thus represent another argument for government intervention through subsidies. 1970-1985: government intervention During the 1960s and 70s many countries in Africa provided subsidized fertilizer to their farmers though state owned enterprises, or \\"parastatals,\\" which generally enjoyed a monopoly on fertilizer distribution and import within the country. The fertilizer distributed by these enterprises sold at a universally reduced price, between 20 and 60 percent of the full market cost. Currency over- valuation also created an additional \\"implicit\\" subsidy for imported fertilizer. These policies were seen as a way to counteract the effects of soil erosion and depletion, and increase crop yields by bringing fertilizer within the reach of subsistence farmers. This followed the dominant ‚Äòmodernization‚Äô model of the period, which aimed to develop production systems in the sector through the promotion of new technologies like fertilizer and improved hybrid seeds. The subsidy programs often suffered from multiple problems. Inefficient bureaucracies contributed to delays in fertilizer delivery. Overstaffing and lack of efficiency incentives increased overall program costs. In cases of inadequate budgets, fertilizer was rationed, barring farmers from accessing sufficient amounts to apply to their crops. Finally, below market-level pricing disincentivized and displaced private distributors of fertilizer who no longer found it economically feasible to compete with subsidized fertilizer. This seriously jeopardized the financial sustainability of the programs. 1985-2005: economic liberalization The 1980s saw the rise of neoclassical liberalism, the Washington Consensus and Structural Adjustment Programs. The dominant philosophy of this period saw underdevelopment as a symptom of allocative inefficiency, placed emphasis on the power of free markets to effect lasting development change and encouraged the minimization of the state's role in the economy. Practices encouraged by structural adjustment programs During this period, multilateral lending agencies and financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank placed \\"conditionalities\\" upon the disbursement of development aid. Countries were required to agree to make a series of \\"structural adjustments\\" to their economies, in order to gain financial assistance or engage in refinancing. The common package of policies prescriptions included currency devaluation, privatization or divestiture of state-owned industries (\\"parastatals\\")in the health and agricultural sectors, trade liberalization (lowering or elimination of tariffs on imports), cuts in social spending (agriculture, health, education sectors) and strict deficit reductions. Structural Adjustment Programs also led to the phasing out of most fertilizer subsidy programs. Some of the African countries following these guidelines included Benin, Ghana, Madagascar, Senegal, Togo, Tanzania, Zambia, Cameroon, Malawi, and Nigeria. Effects of liberalization Results of liberalization and subsidy phase-out were mixed. In a five-year study comparing before and after cases, fertilizer use in Cameroon, Senegal, Tanzania, Nigeria and Ghana declined 25-40 percent, while it increased 14-500 percent in Benin, Togo, Mali, and Madagascar. Subsidies may have been only one factor affecting the price and use of fertilizer. 2005-present: new thinking in subsidies Recently fertilizer subsidies have enjoyed renewed attention as a potentially potent tool for wide scale development in Africa. Jeffrey Sachs, founder of the Millennium Promise Alliance has said of fertilizer use in Africa, that governments should \\"provide subsidized fertilizers to subsistence farmers so that they can produce enough to eat.\\" Recent successful programs in Malawi have also brought renewed attention to fertilizer subsidies. Input vouchers Input vouchers, or certificates allowing farmers to buy agricultural inputs (like fertilizer) at a reduced price, can more precisely target support than pre-structural adjustment universal subsidies. They may also complement the development of private markets, rather than de- incentivizing or undercutting them. The voucher programs are implemented as follows: a farmer receives a voucher that reduces the cost of fertilizer purchased from a private firm or distributor. The private firm can then redeem the voucher for cash plus a commission fee at a designated government facility. Thus the voucher represents a transfer of funds from the government to the farmer. In contrast to blanket subsidies, input vouchers are compatible with private-sector distribution, and must utilize market structures to function. They foster private sector development by guaranteeing a client base and profit margin for the firm, which allows it to expand and develop an economy of scale. Proponents see them as a way to encourage greater adoption of fertilizer use without the blatant market distortions of earlier schemes. Importantly, an \\"exit strategy\\" is more feasible with the voucher program than with universal subsidies. As the private distribution network develops, the voucher can gradually be reduced in value, and be phased out entirely once private markets are functioning. Complementary practices Input voucher programs rely heavily on complementary policies and practices in order to function effectively. For instance, some existing distribution networks (shops, or retailers) must be in place already in order to ensure wide penetration of the input. Some access to microcredit may be necessary to help defray even the initial subsidized costs. Furthermore, subsidized fertilizer programs are most effective when they encourage non-users (farmers who otherwise would not use fertilizer) to participate, thereby creating new sources of production. Concerns Careful program design is needed to precisely target needy farmers, guard against \\"leakage\\" (in which wealthier farmers take advantage of the subsidy program) and maintain a degree of excludability. Wealthier farmers may be in a better position to take advantage of the subsidies, thereby thwarting the original aim of the program. Additionally, the budget allotments for fertilizer subsidies may also incur opportunity costs by diverting public resources away from agricultural extension services, infrastructure building, or research and development.
