Biography As a young man, Bosio was a merchant worker in the British \\"Thomas Adams\\" textile industry,Thomas Adams was born in 1807 at Worksop. as part of his work he had the opportunity to live in London, England for a while and experienced the game of football. Upon returning to his native Turin in 1886 he was determined to spread the word of football in his homeland; he brought back a leather ball and founded Torino Football and Cricket Club that year. Bosio remained involved with the club after they merged with Nobili Torino to form Internazionale Torino. This is the club with whom he competed in the earliest Italian Football Championships, picking up two runners-up medals with the club. He even lured the famous Herbert Kilpin into Italian football, when he was hired to work for Bosio in the textiles industry. In 1900 Bosio remained with the club as they merged into FBC Torinese, picking up another runners-up spot and notably scoring a hat-trick against Milan in the semi-finals of the Italian Football Championship which made him the topscorer of the tournament.

Boss Media was publicly traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from 1999 to 2008, when GEMed bought the company and rebranded it to GTECH Gaming.  History  Boss Media was founded in 1996, with the initial corporate aim to operate Gold Club Casino, which it launched in 1997. Soon after the online casino was launched, Bossmedia launched Casino.com as a casino news portal and the company started receiving requests from investors and companies interested in purchasing Boss Media's casino software as a white label. Boss Media's main focus thereby transferred to the creation of complete white label Internet casino solutions for clients and began to sell licenses at around 300,000 US dollars plus a revenue share. During the years following, Boss Media was a dominant player in the global online casino software market alongside Microgaming, CryptoLogic and later Playtech amongst others. During the boom in US online gambling prior to its US ban in 2004, Boss Media was supporting some 32 or more licensees with its software. Boss Media's corporate focus later shifted to the creation of customised e-gaming systems for several gaming corporations. Boss Media sold its own Internet casino in February 2004 to focus entirely on the e-gaming solutions it develops for clients. Boss Media now provides e-gaming solutions for online casino operators including bwin and Sportingbet.

The narrator of the story is Larry Delaney, an Irish boy who appears regularly in O'Connor's stories, and serves as O'Connor's alter ego. Plot Larry is a typical mischievous Irish boy who likes to skip school and runs with a rough crowd. Larry fears that, because of his misbehavior, Santa Claus won't be leaving him any presents for Christmas. His fears are stoked by his mother, who scolds him constantly and compares him unfavorably to his smarter, better-behaved younger brother Sonny. Larry resents his mother, who constantly pushes him to excel at school and frets aloud that he will amount to nothing, like his drunken father. On Christmas morning, Larry wakes up early and finds that Santa Claus has left only a book in his stocking, while there's nothing but a toy gun in Sonny's. Since Larry has no interest in books, he switches the presents, taking the gun for himself and leaving the book to the more studious Sonny. He imagines that no one but Santa Claus will ever know the difference. To his horror, his mother sees the difference instantly, and weeps that her son is a thief. In that instant, Larry realizes for the first time that there is no Santa Claus, only an impoverished mother who's been striving vainly to raise a decent son under miserable circumstances. By giving Larry a book, his Mother had been trying to steer him to success and a better life. By shunning the book and stealing the toy gun, Larry has broken his mother's heart, and convinced her that he will become a rotter like his father.

The Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the Socialist Party to advise Socialist-led communes on infrastructure projects and public works, which the party advocated the modernisation of. The affair became public in 1989 when two police officers, Antoine Gaudino and Alain Mayot, investigating the Marseille regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and financial dealings between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by Henri Nallet, who then became Justice Minister. In 1990 Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Antoine Gaudino later wrote about his findings in a book, L'Enqu√™te Impossible.

Thornton Breaking Cover by Philip Reinagle Philip Reinagle entered the schools of the Royal Academy in 1769, and later became a pupil of Allan Ramsay, whom he assisted on his numerous portraits of George III and Queen Charlotte. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1773. The works he showed were almost all portraits until 1785, when the monotonous work of producing replicas of royal portraits appears to have given him a distaste for portraiture, and led him to abandon it for animal painting. He became very successful in his treatment of sporting dogs, especially spaniels, of birds, and of dead game. In 1787, however, he showed a View taken from Brackendale Hill, Norfolk, at the academy and from then on exhibited works mostly landscapes. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1787, but did not become an academician until 1812, when he presented as his diploma picture An Eagle and a Vulture disputing with a Hyaena. He also exhibited frequently at the British Institution. Reinagle was also an accomplished copyist of the Dutch masters, and his reproductions of cattle-pieces and landscapes by Paul Potter, Ruisdael, Hobbema, Berchem, Wouwerman, Adriaen van de Velde, Karel Dujardin, and others have often been passed off as originals. He also made some of the drawings for Robert John Thornton's New Illustration of the Sexual System of Linnaeus (1799‚Äì1807), and for his Philosophy of Botany (1809‚Äì10) ; but his best drawings for book illustration were those of dogs for William Taplin's Sportsman's Cabinet (1803) which were engraved by John Scott.

Early life Archibald Fowler Bennett was born to William David Bennett and Emma Neat on 17 March 1896 at Dingle, Bear Lake County, Idaho. In May 1899 his parents accepted a request from Lorenzo Snow to settle in southern Alberta, Canada, and work on the canal which was being built there. They travelled all of July in covered wagons and settled in Magrath. The family moved to Taber in 1907, where he graduated high school in 1914. After attending Normal School at Calgary, Alberta, in 1915 and receiving a First-Class Teacher's Certificate, he taught in Neidpath, Marchessault and Barnwell. Bennett enlisted March 26, 1916, in the 13th Canadian Mounted Rifles after listening to a recruiting speech by Hugh B. Brown. He sailed for England in June and was transferred to the Fort Garry Horse in the Canadian Cavalry Brigade. He served in France from 1916 to May 1919, and was discharged in Winnipeg June 2. His father died October 24, 1916, while Bennett was overseas. When Bennett returned to Canada he taught school for one year in the Taber High School, and then in the Knight Academy in Raymond. He married Ella Milner on December 21, 1921, in the Salt Lake Temple. Bennett attended the University of Utah, working in the evenings in the office of the Superior Baking Co. In 1923, with about 500 others, he took the Civil Service Examination for Postal Clerk, and as he received the highest rating, was appointed a Clerk and worked full-time in the Money Order & Registry Division in the evenings. This greatly simplified the problem of financing his schooling and supporting his family. He graduated with a B.A. degree in 1925 and was elected to the National Honor Society, Phi Kappa Phi. He went on to receive his M.A. in 1926 in History and Political Science. Genealogy His interest and training in genealogy began when he helped his mother in a Relief Society course in Genealogy when he was 15. His interest continued in genealogical research and he did much research on his family and for others whenever he could go to the Genealogical Society of Utah. Several articles by him were published in the quarterly of the Society, \\"Romance of a Pedigree\\" in 1927 and \\"A Legacy from the Past\\" in 1928. On September 1, 1928, while preparing to go east to obtain a doctorate, he accepted an offer to become Secretary of the Genealogical Society of Utah and to edit the Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine; a year later he was also appointed as organization's Librarian. He served in the Genealogical Society of Utah, later the Genealogical Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, until 1961. He developed the Pedigree Chart and Family Group Record used in the LDS Church's genealogical record system. He became a research specialist who helped people with their research problems, and was referred to as \\"Mr. Genealogy.\\" When Genealogical instruction was incorporated in the LDS Church's Sunday School curriculum in 1940, Bennett became a member of the Sunday School General Board, serving until 1962. Brigham Young University, which had begun teaching genealogy in 1921, had Bennett instruct starting in 1952, and taught two classes twice a week at BYU for 15 years, while also carrying on his other assignments. Bennett supervised the beginning of microfilming by the society. In 1946 Bennett was assigned by the Utah Genealogical Society to approach the officials of record repositories in the Eastern United States for official permission to microfilm their records, in exchange for a microfilm copy of the records they filmed. Another enticement was that the Society would permanently hold \\"security copies\\" on film of otherwise irreplaceable documents, should anything happen to the original records. While Ernst Koehler made the microfilms, Bennett traveled from state to state finding people who would allow the society to film their records. Through these efforts records from nine eastern states were microfilmed. In 1947 he was sent to Europe for four months representing the Genealogical Society in making contacts in England, Wales, the Netherlands, Norway and Italy for permission to microfilm extensive collections of parish registers, probate, census and military records. In 1948 he went to Europe again to complete microfilming arrangements in these countries and in Germany, Switzerland and France, and he also supervised the copying of the Vaudois Protestant records from Italy. In November 1962 he was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists. Bennett was appointed Supervisor of Genealogical Education for the Society and throughout the LDS Church in 1963, with responsibility for approval of all instructors of genealogical courses given by BYU, and of general courses given by the Genealogical Society. He also served on Committees of Microfilm Planning, Records Approval, Education and Publication. He was appointed a member of the Priesthood Genealogical Conference Staff, assigned to go with General Authorities to quarterly Stake conferences to stress genealogy. In 1964 the Board of Trustees of the Society approved a Branch Library program, and Bennett was appointed Librarian in charge of the new program. He organized and guided each of the 21 branch libraries that opened between 1964 and August 1965. Bennett died of a heart attack August 28, 1965, at age 69 in American Fork, en route to a Priesthood Genealogical assignment in Provo, and was buried 1 September in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. Works Bennett wrote genealogy manuals used by the LDS Sunday Schools, Relief Society, and BYU. A number of his writings were printed in the Improvement Era, The Instructor, and the Church News. His most famous work was Saviors on Mount Zion, which was used as a manual by the LDS Church Sunday School in 1950. His other works include A Guide for Genealogical Research; Valiant in the Faith: Gardner and Sarah Snow and their Family (with Ella M. Bennett and Barbara Bennett Roach); Our Legacy from William and Elizabeth New: New, Neat, Nate, Passey, Oakey, Ellsworth families with Blanche Bennett Nordgren; Searching with Success: a genealogical text; Family Exaltation; Finding your Forefathers in America and Proving your Pedigree. He also published journal articles including \\"The Vaudois of the Alpine Valleys and their Contribution to Utah and Latter-day Saint History\\" in the Winter 1960 edition of BYU Studies. An article he wrote on the descendants of Richard Bennett of Virginia was published in the William & Mary Quarterly in 1936. ;Hymns Alexander Schreiner, Tabernacle Organist and fellow Sunday School Board member asked Bennett to write the words for a hymn on temple service for a new hymn book to be published in 1948. \\"Holy Temples on Mount Zion\\" was the poem chosen from the two he wrote, and was set to music by Schreiner. It is hymn #289 in the 1985 English-language LDS Hymnal. ;Television In the first series of its kind to be produced on television, Bennett presented a series of 42 TV shows on genealogy in 1954 over KDYL-TV, sponsored by Brigham Young University and the Utah Genealogical Society. He was author and moderator of the program, and was assisted by Mrs. Arta Ballif of the BYU Speech Department. \\"What's Your Name?\\" demonstrated interesting phases of genealogical research, and the first one featured the pedigree of President Eisenhower. Other interesting pedigrees demonstrating the principles and procedure of research followed. During the half-hour program, many individuals themselves were introduced and took part on each program.

Biography  Ramsay Richard Reinagle was a pupil of his father Philip Reinagle, whose style he followed, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy as early as 1788. He afterwards went to Italy, and was studying in Rome in 1796. Subsequently, he visited Holland in order to study from the Dutch masters. After his return home he painted for a time at Robert Barker's panorama in Leicester Square, and then entered into partnership with Thomas Edward Barker, Robert's eldest son, who was not himself an artist, in order to erect a rival building in the Strand. They produced panoramas of Rome, the Bay of Naples, Florence, Gibraltar, Bay of Gibraltar, and Paris, but in 1816 disposed of their exhibition to Henry Aston Barker and John Burford. In 1805 Reinagle was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Watercolours, and in 1806 a member. He became its treasurer in 1807, and was president from 1808 to 1812 Between 1806 and 1812 he sent to its exhibitions sixty-seven drawings, mostly Italian landscapes and scenery of the English lakes. During the same period he exhibited portraits and landscapes in oil at the Royal Academy, of which he became an associate in 1814, and an academician in 1823. He was a clever copyist of the old masters, and is said to have been much employed by a picture-dealer in restoring and \\"improving\\" their works. In 1848 he sent to the Royal Academy exhibition as his own work a small picture of Shipping a Breeze and Rainy Weather off Hurst Castle painted by a young artist named J. W. Yarnold, which he had purchased at a broker's shop, and to which he had made some slight alterations. Attention was called to the deception, and a full inquiry made by the academy resulted in his being called upon to resign his diploma as a royal academician. In 1850 he unsuccessfully endeavoured to exculpate himself in two letters published in the Literary Gazette. He continued to exhibit at the academy until 1857, but in his later years sank into poverty, and was assisted by a pension from the funds of the academy. He died at Chelsea on 17 November 1862. \\"Water Spaniel\\" (1815)  Works  Three plates, Richmond, Sion House, and The Opening of Waterloo Bridge in William Bernard Cooke's The Thames were engraved after him by Robert Wallis, and many of the illustrations in Peacock's Polite Repository from 1818 to 1830, were engraved by John Pye from his designs. There is also a view of Haddon Hall, engraved by Robert Wallis, in the Bijou for 1828, and one of Bothwell Castle, engraved by Edward Finden, in John Tillotson's Album of Scottish Scenery, 1860. Reinagle wrote the scientific and explanatory notices to Turner's Views in Sussex published in 1819, and the life of Allan Ramsay in Allan Cunningham's Lives of the British Painters. Reinagle's paintings are included in the collections of several British institutions including Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster and Derby Art Gallery and in the Government Art Collection.RR Reinagle, BBC, accessed August 2011 Family Reinagle married Oriana Bullfinch in 1801.

A force of 600 Kurdish Peshmerga was subsequently deployed in the area, and ditches were dug around Yazidi villages to prevent further attacks.  Details  The bombings occurred at around 7:20 pm local time on August 14, 2007, when four co-ordinated suicide bomb attacks detonated in the Yazidi towns of Qahtaniyah and Jazeera (Siba Sheikh Khidir), near Mosul. They targeted the Yazidi, a religious minority in Iraq,Dozens killed in multiple suicide attacks in Iraq ‚Äì CNN.com using a fuel tanker and three cars.

The rule resolves this ambiguity as follows: * If A has living children at the time of the grant, A and her children take the property as joint tenants. * If A does not have living children at the time of the grant, A takes the property in fee tail. This rule has fallen into disuse in those jurisdictions which no longer recognize the fee tail as a legal estate. Some U.S. states ignore the rule altogether, and interpret such a grant as giving a life estate and creating a remainder in her children. Section 14.2 of the Restatement (Third) of Property repudiates the Rule in Wild's Case, suggesting that many authorities consider it to be obsolete.

She had the dangerous task of supplying fuel and ammunition to ships in and near, combat areas in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. SS Esso Columbia II was built at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. for the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey; launched on 7 September 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Harold G. McAvenia; renamed by the Navy Atascosa and designated AO-66 on 16 September 1942; purchased by the Navy on 12 October 1942: and commissioned on 9 November 1942, Lt. Comdr. Melvin H. Bassett in command.  World War II North Atlantic operations  Following her commissioning at Baltimore, Maryland, the oiler sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she arrived on 19 November. At the conclusion of a month of trials, she got underway on 19 December for Port Arthur, Texas, where she took on a cargo of fuel oil and gasoline and then returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 3 January 1943. After a two-day respite, Atascosa left the U.S. East Coast, bound for Bermuda. She spent one week there before sailing back into Norfolk on 16 January. Atascosa made another run to Port Arthur for more oil and discharged that cargo at Norfolk before entering a drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for a brief period of repairs. When the oiler was refloated, she began preparations for a deployment to the Pacific.  Transfer to the Pacific Fleet  Atascosa left Norfolk on 19 March and, after stops at Galveston, Texas, and Baytown, Texas, transited the Panama Canal on 4 April. Her ultimate destination was Noumea, New Caledonia, which she reached on 28 April. The oiler discharged her cargo and then loaded more fuel oil and aviation gasoline to be taken to Samoa. She arrived at Pago Pago on 4 May, but left the next day, bound for the United States, and reached San Pedro, California, on 28 May. There, she took on a cargo of petroleum and aircraft for transportation to Suva, Fiji Islands, and Noum√©a, New Caledonia. More shuttling between the U.S. West Coast and these ports and the west coast occupied June, July, and August. In early September, Atascosa left Noumea and set course for Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. She arrived there on 9 September and began her duties fueling various ships of the fleet. In October, the oiler added Tulagi and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands to her fueling stops. She broke this routine somewhat by a trip to Nandi Bay in the Fiji Islands, where she arrived on Christmas Eve 1943. After delivering fuel and supplies, she again got underway on 11 January 1944 to return to Espiritu Santo.  Searching for survivors in the water  Atascosa put to sea on 15 February to rendezvous with Rear Admiral Merrill's Task Force (TF) 39. She fueled three cruisers and four destroyers at sea before returning to Purvis Bay. A second fueling rendezvous with TF 39 took place on 6 March. The oiler stopped briefly at Purvis Bay, then went to Espiritu Santo on 15 March to begin preparations to rendezvous with a part of TF 58. The meeting occurred at sea on 26 March. Shortly after midnight on the morning of 28 March, Atascosa was informed that a Liberator bomber had gone down in the vicinity of the fueling group, and she began a search for its crew. Observers on the oiler spotted a life raft, but it proved to be unoccupied, and Atascosa soon terminated her rescue efforts.  Approached by a Japanese aircraft  On 29 March, she was servicing units of Destroyer Divisions 93 and 94 when a Japanese plane closed the group. After Atascosa fired two rounds at the intruder, the plane quickly departed. The rest of her mission passed without incident, and Atascosa retired to Espiritu Santo on 5 April.  Stateside overhaul  On 21 May, Atascosa left New Caledonia, bound for the west coast. She arrived at Terminal Island, California, on 7 June to undergo a routine overhaul and repairs. The yard work was completed on 22 July, and the ship got underway to return to her wartime duties. She touched briefly at Pearl Harbor before finally arriving at Eniwetok on 11 August. There, she unloaded her deck cargo and serviced a number of destroyers. Standing out to sea on the 17th, the ship fueled battleships Iowa (BB-61), Indiana (BB-58), and Alabama (BB-60). At a rendezvous with the fast carrier task force between Rota and Guam on 4 September, Atascosa serviced several destroyers and aircraft carrier Enterprise (CV-6).  Fueling during adverse weather  Air alerts interrupted the oiler's routine at Saipan between the 5th and the 9th, before she steamed to Guam. During September Atascosa fueled many units of task force TF 38. She made stops at Saipan and Eniwetok before arriving at Ulithi on 13 October. She got underway again on 21 October to rendezvous with TG 30.8 in an area east of Luzon. The oiler was fueling task force TF 38.3 in early November when she encountered high, seas and increasingly strong winds. During the operation, hose lines between ships were carried away several times. On 7 November, while fueling Langley (CVL-27), the steel manifold on the after port 6-inch connection was carried away, forcing the suspension of operations. Six members of Atascosa's crew were injured while making and tending gasoline connections. The weather abated on 9 November, allowing the oiler's crew to make temporary repairs so that fueling could be resumed. Atascosa put into port at Ulithi on 17 November. She sailed on 10 December to meet fast carrier forces off Cape Enga√±o and again encountered heavy seas. This soon developed into a typhoon; and, by 18 December, visibility was reduced to zero. The next day, the weather had improved enough to allow fueling to resume. Atascosa returned to Ulithi on 23 December for the Christmas holidays.  Fueling the fleet at Okinawa  During January and February 1945, Atascosa supported the operations of TG 30.8 and made several meetings with TF 58. She dropped anchor at Ulithi on 3 March for repair work. The ships of TF 58 left Ulithi several days before Atascosa departed on 19 March to support their attacks on the Japanese homeland. Her next assignment was to fuel the ships of TG 50.8, which were anchored off Okinawa. Atascosa returned to Ulithi on 1 May to undergo repairs and to replenish supplies. In mid-June, Atascosa set her course for Okinawa, where she remained for a month. After a brief supply stop at Ulithi, the oiler put to sea on 8 August to rendezvous with TF 38 off southern Honsh≈´. While engaged in this mission, she received word of Japan's capitulation.  End-of-war activity  Atascosa returned to Ulithi on 31 August. However, her service in the Pacific had not yet ended, as she left on 8 September to steam to Tokyo Bay. She remained in Japan until 24 September, then sailed to San Pedro, California. The oiler arrived back in the United States on 8 October.  Post- war decommissioning  Atascosa was decommissioned on 21 January 1946 at Mare Island, California; her name was struck from the Navy list on 7 February; and she was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946. Sold to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1947 and renamed SS Esso Syracuse, she transferred to Panamanian registry in 1950 but continued serving as SS Esso Syracuse until scrapped at Genoa 1960. forward part grafted to after part of SS Esso Buffalo which became bulk carrier SS Spitfire and was scrapped 1973.

The parish also includes the settlement of Spurstow Sketh and part of Radmore Green. The total population is a little over 400 people. Nearby villages include Bunbury, Haughton and Peckforton. The parish is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and contains a salt spring, which was formerly used as a spa. History Spurstow appears as \\"Spuretone\\" in the Domesday Book of 1086; it was then held by Robert FitzHugh, and around 180 acres had been cleared for agricultural use.Cheshire Federation of Women's Institutes 1990, p. 203 Remains of a medieval village have been found somewhat to the north west of the existing village of Spurstow, which is believed to have subsequently contracted or moved. William de Spurstowe held the manor of Spurstow in the 13th century, and it remained in the hands of the de Spurstowe family until 1685, when it was purchased by the Crewe family. Lower Spurstow was owned by the Aldersey family from the mid-15th century; they lived in the half-timbered Lower Spurstow Hall, which was demolished in around 1891. A silver-gilt crucifix designed to be worn on a chain, dating from the late 14th to early 15th century, was found in the civil parish in 2000. The area was historically important in salt extraction, with an 18th-century brine spa known as Spurstow White Water or Spurstow Spa, which was credited with health- giving effects. The spa still existed in the mid-19th century, when it appeared in the Topographical Dictionary of England (1848) by Samuel Lewis, who wrote \\"A mineral spring called Spurstow Spa was formerly much frequented, and baths were erected by Sir Thomas Mostyn, for the accommodation of visiters; but the waters are not at present in repute.\\"Lewis 1848, pp. 164‚Äì70 A school was built by Hungerford Crewe, Lord Crewe in 1872. The village's shop and post office closed in the 1970s, and the school's closure followed in 1983. Governance Spurstow is administered by the Spurstow Parish Council. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 Spurstow falls in the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury,Cheshire East Council & Cheshire West and Chester Council: Interactive Mapping: Eddisbury (accessed 30 September 2016) which has been represented by Edward Timpson since 2019, after being represented by Stephen O'Brien (1999‚Äì2015) and Antoinette Sandbach (2015‚Äì19). Geography and transport The majority of the civil parish is relatively flat, sloping gently upwards from north to south with an average elevation of around 70‚Äì80 metres; the south of the parish, towards Ridley, slopes upwards more steeply, with a high point of around 120 metres. Two brooks cross the parish running broadly east‚Äìwest, and there is a saline spring within a small area of woodland named Spa Plantation or Bath Wood in the south of the parish at . The A49 runs north‚Äìsouth through the west of the civil parish. It connects to Long Lane which runs south east to Haughton and Radmore Green, with two other lanes splitting from it: Bunbury Lane runs north to Lower Bunbury, and Capper's Lane runs south east to the boundary with Brindley. Additionally, Badcock's Lane runs east connecting the A49 with Long Lane and Capper's Lane, and Peckforton Hall Lane runs west connecting the A49 with Peckforton. The A534 runs north-west to south-east immediately south of the parish boundary. Demography According to the 2001 Census, the parish had a population of 394, increasing to 413 in 164 households at the 2011 Census. This represents a decline from the population in 1851 but an increase since 1951; historical population figures are 339 (1801), 562 (1851), 434 (1901) and 323 (1951). The population density was 0.6 persons/hectare in 2011, well below the average of 3.2 persons/hectare for Cheshire East. Landmarks Bath House, Lower Spurstow The remains of a medieval village are present at near Haycroft, with six house platforms and evidence of medieval ridge and furrow ploughing. Bath House is a half-timbered house at in Lower Spurstow, dating from the late 16th century, which might have housed visitors to the nearby saline spring. The oldest listed building in the civil parish, it is designated grade II*. Several 17th-century farmhouses and cottages, many of which are also timber framed, are listed at the lower grade of II: Haycroft Farm, Dolphin Cottage, Lower Hall Cottage, Spurstow Hall Cottages, Talbarn (originally a barn), The Butlands and The Cottage in Spurstow village. All that is left of the demolished Lower Spurstow Hall are its grade-II-listed red sandstone gate piers, dating from the late 17th century, which are topped by pineapple-shaped finials. A former Methodist chapel in chequered brick, dated 1844, stands off Peckforton Hall Lane; it was originally Primitive Methodist. Two grade-II-listed buildings were erected by Hungerford Crewe in the early 1870s; the former Spurstow School was designed in the Gothic Revival style by Thomas Bower and is built in red and blue brick with the tiles forming red and blue stripes;Hartwell et al. 2011, pp. 586‚Äì87 and Spurstow Smithy is a red- brick building with cast-iron lattice windows bearing the Crewe emblem. The 19th-century Spurstow Hall was a model farm on the Crewe estate. Notable residents One of the seats of the Aldersey family, Lower Spurstow Hall, was in Spurstow. Notable members of that family who lived in the parish include the explorer Laurence Aldersey (1546‚Äì97/8) and Thomas Aldersey (1521/2‚Äì1598), a merchant, MP and philanthropist who founded a grammar school in Bunbury.

KCG is the main institution of the KCG Group. KCG‚Äôs Eki-mae is the main campus which is centrally located near the Kyoto Station. KCG also has other sites at the Kamogawa Campus which houses the Computer Graphics Art Department and the Rakuhoku Campus where the Computer Informatics Department is found. The KCG group is also composed of The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics (KCGI), the Kyoto Japanese Language Training Center (KJLTC), KCG Career, Inc. and KCG Co., Ltd.--- all global education-related institutions. Over nearly half a century, KCG has developed a strong and growing alumni network of 37,000 members who are currently active in the Japanese information industry.  History  Kyoto Computer Gakuin was established by Yasuko and Shigeo Hasegawa in 1963. Yasuko Hasegawa, the first woman to be enrolled at Kyoto University's doctoral program in Astrophysics, formed a study group for IBM 709/7090 and started teaching to young faculty and graduate students at Kyoto University. They called the workshop as \\"the FORTRAN Research Seminar\\" which was later renamed as the \\"Kyoto Software Research Seminar\\". This workshop became Kyoto Computer Gakuin (Kyoto School of Computer Science) in 1969. Japan was then entering a period of economic growth and recovery in the post-war period and computers were still rare at that time. Only a handful of organizations like major banks, university research centers and airline companies possessed computer technology. At that time, people asked: \\"Why should the average person study computers? What is the computer for?\\" \\"What do we need computer education for at this time?\\" But Yasuko and Shigeo Hasegawa, both educators, had the foresight of the future society in the IT era. Founders Yasuko and Shigeo Hasegawa organized the \\"FORTRAN Research Seminar\\" in Kyoto in 1963. This became the roots of Kyoto Computer Gakuin and the KCG Group of institutions. There was an urgent need to have this kind of research group studying programming languages. However, there were neither accessible computer equipment nor books on computing in bookstores and FORTRAN could be used in Japan on a few computers which at that time were all imported. Under the ill-equipped environment of those times, Yasuko Hasegawa, the incumbent KCG president, struggled to develop a computer education system. In 1986, KCG co-founder Shigeo Hasegawa died at the age of 56. From Kyoto‚Äôs FORTRAN Research Seminar to The Kyoto Software Research Seminar The FORTRAN Research Seminar was started as the independent seminar which studied the uses and applications of FORTRAN. All the attendees were young research scientists from Kyoto University. \\"The FORTRAN Research Seminar\\" was renamed as the \\"Kyoto Software Research Seminar\\". The uses of software was studied from a wider perspective, as the Kyoto Software Research Seminar group took in members not only from the academic community but from various sectors of society and subsequently the members found themselves involved in various educational activities. The latter part of 1960s saw the emergence of Japanese made computers. By using the locally made \\"HITAC-10\\" computer, the seminar group was able to conduct courses on programming and as students increased, Hasegawa‚Äôs group had to rent an extra room as a computer laboratory. In 1969, the \\"Kyoto Software Research Seminar\\" was renamed as \\"Kyoto Computer Gakuin\\". In the subsequent years, computer facilities of the school rapidly increased with the growing demand for computer education. Outreach program: The early years In the beginning, KCG founders Yasuko and Shigeo Hasegawa set the example by taking it upon themselves to transport the HITAC-10 in their car whenever there was a need to give lectures in faraway venues. Later, KCG acquired the medium-scale-computer of Toshiba; the TOSBAC3400, IBM's main frames‚Äîthe IBM 370, 4341, 3031; the large-scale UNIVAC (later called UNISYS) 1100, 1106 computers. In 1983 when the PC was just coming out of the market, KCG acquired a large number of PCs and initiated a PC Loan Program lending PCs to all KCG students for free. Even the major universities did not engage in any such program, but this is one of the early evidence of the KCG founding president‚Äôs clear vision for the development of computer education in Japan.  Mission statements  #Provide education in the theoretical aspects of computer technology. #Provide education that meets the demands of the society and IT sector. #Encourage the further development of computer technologyÔºé #Cultivate interdisciplinary ways of thinkingÔºé #Promote both the intellectual and various aspects of student character.  KCG Group Global Orientation =International Development of Computer Education Program (IDCE): KCG Group‚Äôs current global outreach program The International Development of Computer Education (IDCE) program is a special program to expand computer education initiated in 1988 by Yasuko Hasegawa and her daughter Yu Hasegawa (a.k.a. Yu Hasegawa-Johnson). Over the past several years, the IDCE program has donated almost 3,000 computers and provided computer instruction to countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. IDCE's launched its first project by donating 350 8-bit personal computers to the government of Thailand. The computers were distributed to Thailand‚Äôs secondary and upper level schools in 1988. IDCE then went to other countries such as Ghana, Poland, Kenya, Peru, and Zimbabwe. As of March 2008, 21 countries have been benefited by IDCE. IDCE's goal is to widen access to basic computers for educational purposes in developing countries, where often there is no public access to computer technology. The program aims to enhance basic computer literacy and serves also as a medium for encouraging cultural exchange between Japan and participating countries. Academic Exchange Agreements The KCG Group of institutions also has academic exchange agreements with various institutions with Information Technology programs in the US (Rochester Institute of Technology College of Imaging Arts and Sciences and B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences (RIT), in Asia (China's Tianjin University of Science and Technology (TUST), Dalian University of Foreign Language, Fujian Normal University, Nanjing University of Technology and Korea's Korea University Graduate School of Information Security), Cheju National University, and in Europe (the Czech Republic's VSB-Technical University of Ostrava). On May 15, 2008 the KCG Group (including KCG and The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics) and the University of Pardubice, one of the best national universities in the Czech Republic held the world's first online academic exchange agreement signing ceremonies between two universities in Japan and Europe. The KCG Group and the University of Pardubice signed the memorandum of understanding for academic exchange agreement by holding ceremonies using video conferencing technology. KCG‚Äôs RIT Summer Workshop KCG‚Äôs academic agreement with RIT was established in 1996. Since then KCG organizes the RIT Summer workshop where students get the chance to attend classes at RIT‚Äôs College of Imaging Arts and Sciences and B. Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences and have a feel of campus life in the US as well as see the sights in Rochester, Niagara Falls and New York City.

History MetroFi was founded in 2002 by Chuck Haas, who helped start Covad, and Pankaj Shah, in Mountain View, California. Investors included Sevin Rosen Funds, August Capital, and Western Technology Investments. Funding of $9 million was announced in April 2004, as well as an \\"Investors' Choice\\" award at the Dow Jones Wireless Ventures private equity conference. MetroFi announced conventional Wi-Fi wireless Internet access to municipalities in September 2005 at the MuniWireless show in San Francisco.Official website via archive.org It began offering free, advertising-supported, unencrypted, low-bandwidth wireless Internet access in December 2005 in parts of its local Silicon Valley area. In most of its service areas it provided an unencrypted, advertising-supported \\"free\\" service as well as an encrypted (using Wi-Fi Protected Access), ad-free \\"premium\\" service for approximately $20/month. During 2006, its data rate was restricted to 1 Mbit/s downstream and 256 kbit/s upstream. Coverage and performance of the premium and free service was otherwise identical. MetroFi also provided fixed-wireless service. The company planned to use wireless mesh network technology from SkyPilot, and the Webwise targeted advertising service from Phorm. Cities covered, according to the MetroFi Web site, included: *California: Concord, Cupertino, Foster City, Riverside, San Jose, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale *Illinois: Aurora *Oregon: Portland The Riverside announcement included a partnership with AT&T; announced in July 2006. A test of the ability to get a connection in outdoor areas within 500 feet of an access point in the Portland proof-of-concept network in the early spring of 2007 showed about a 58% probability using a standard 30 mW, low-gain client device. The report concluded that the probability the network was providing a connection to those devices in 90% of outdoor areas, as called for, was 2 in a billion. The Portland network was less than 30% complete, and as of October 2007 further deployment halted. The contract with Portland required MetroFi to complete the network by August 2009.Nonexclusive License Agreement with the City of Portland A group monitoring the Portland network estimated that the network provided a 90% probability of getting a connection outdoors in about 4% of the city in late 2007.Willamette Week Rogue of the Week On May 15, 2008 MetroFi announced that it was seeking buyers for its networks. Having failed to find a buyer, it scheduled and performed a shutdown of its network on June 20, 2008. MetroFi offered to sell its Portland network to the city. However, in October 2008, assets of the Portland network were seized by the city as abandoned. Santa Clara acquired the MetroFi network in that city to support its Silicon Valley Power utility. It redesigned and expanded service in 2012.

He was a pupil of his father, but he gained much facility in the treatment of marine subjects by copying the works of the Dutch painters Ludolf Backhuysen and Willem van de Velde. He exhibited first at the Royal Academy in 1822, when he sent a portrait of a gentleman; but in 1824 he contributed a 'Ship in a Storm firing a Signal of Distress', and a 'Calm', and in 1825 'A Dutch Fleet at the Seventeenth Century coming to Anchor in a Breeze', and other naval subjects in the following years. In 1827 he was present on board the Mosquito at the battle of Navarino and on his return he drew on stone, and published in 1828, 'Illustrations of the Battle of Navarin,' which was followed by 'Illustrations of the Occurrences at the Entrance of the Bay of Patras between the English Squadron and Turkish Fleets 1827. He also painted incidents of these engagements, which were exhibited in 1829, 1830 and 1831. He was present with the English fleet on the coast of Portugal in 1833 and his picture of 'Admiral Napier's Glorious Triumph over the Miguelite Squadron' was one of his contributions to the Royal Academy in 1834. Four naval subjects in 1835 were his last exhibited works. He worked both in oil and in watercolours, and gave much promise as a painter of shipping and marine pieces. His works appeared also at the British Institution, and occasionally at the Society of British Artists. Reinagle died at 11 Great Randolph Street, Camden Town, London, on 6 December 1835, aged 33.

Biography Joseph Reinagle, the son of a German musician resident in England, was born in Portsmouth in 1762. He was the brother of Alexander Reinagle. He was at first intended for the navy, but became apprentice to a jeweller in Edinburgh. Then, adopting music as a profession, he studied the French horn and trumpet with his father, and soon appeared in public as a player of those instruments. Acting on medical advice, he abandoned the wind instruments, and studied the violoncello under Schetky (who married his sister), and the violin under Aragoni. He succeeded so well that he was appointed leader of the Edinburgh Theatre band. After appearing as a cellist in London, he went in 1784 to Dublin, where he remained for two years. Returning to London, he took a prominent position in the chief orchestras, and was principal cello at the Salomon concerts under Haydn, who showed him much kindness. Engaged to play at the Oxford concerts, he was so well received that he settled in the city and died there in November 1825. Reinagle was a very able violoncellist, and enjoyed a wide popularity. Nathaniel Gow was one of his Edinburgh pupils. He composed a good deal of music for violin, violoncello, and pianoforte, and wrote a Concise Introduction to the Art of playing the Violoncello (London, 1830), which went through four editions. A son, Alexander Robert Reinagle, musician, born at Brighton on 11 August 1799, was from 1823 to 1853 organist of St. Peter's-in- the-East, Oxford, and died at Kidlington, Oxfordshire, where he was buried on 6 April 1877. He published Psalm Tunes for the Voice and Pianoforte (circa 1830), in which appears the tune 'St. Peter,' widely used, and included in most church collections of the late nineteenth century.

Baggy Point forms part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the Saunton To Baggy Point Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SSSI designation is for both geological and botanical interest. The geological interest is in the Upper Devonian Sandstones. The fauna in the rocks is poor but contains bivalves, possibly of brackish to freshwater affinities, and plant remains. The botanical designation is for maritime heathland, grassland and lichens. Lichens which are common in this SSI but unusual elsewhere include Pannaria microphylla, Pannaria nebulosa, Squamarina crassa and the rare Lecania ralfsii. The birds which can be seen at Baggy Point include guillemots, razorbills, Dartford warblers, stonechats and cormorants. Seals are often seen swimming around the point and the grazing land is used by Hebridean sheep and Ruby Red cattle which have been introduced to keep down the brambles, gorse and bracken.

In astronomy and atomic physics, doubly ionized oxygen is the ion O2+ (also known as O III in spectroscopic notation). Its emission forbidden lines in the visible spectrum fall primarily at the wavelength 500.7 nm, and secondarily at 495.9 nm. Before spectra of oxygen ions became known, these lines once led to a spurious identification of the substance as a new chemical element. Concentrated levels of O III are found in diffuse and planetary nebulae. Consequently, narrow band-pass filters that isolate the 501 nm and 496 nm wavelengths of light, that correspond to green- turquoise-cyan spectral colors, are useful in observing these objects, causing them to appear at higher contrast against the filtered and consequently blacker background of space (and possibly light-polluted terrestrial atmosphere) where the frequencies of [O III] are much less pronounced. These emission lines were first discovered in the spectra of planetary nebulae in the 1860s. At that time, they were thought to be due to a new element which was named nebulium. In 1927, Ira Sprague Bowen published the current explanation identifying their source as doubly ionized oxygen. Permitted lines of O III lie in the Middle Ultraviolet band and are hence inaccessible to terrestrial astronomy.

The IV Corps formed part of the extended center of the French line at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805.Chandler, 31. During the battle, Napoleon ordered Soult to attack the Pratzen Heights, from which the Allies had been attacking the French right wing. Repeated attacks from the Russians under General Kutuzov almost broke through the line of IV Corps, but aid from Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's I Corps allowed the French to maintain their control of the Heights. The survivors then moved south and enveloped General Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden's column, sending the Allies into a retreat.Chandler, 35.

He grew up in Hawke's Bay, where he practised until his retirement in 1997. Biography Natusch was born in Hastings in 1921, the son of architect Rene Natusch. During World War II, he served in the Royal New Zealand Navy from 1942 to 1945 on destroyers and motor torpedo boats, serving in the North Sea and English Channel for D-Day operations. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in May 1944, for good service against enemy light forces. Natusch's grandfather, Charles Natusch, had arrived in New Zealand in 1886 and founded the architectural and quantity surveying firm, Natusch & Sons. Guy Natusch was active in the firm from 1946 to 1997, working on both commercial and residential projects. His style of architecture emphasized the building's function over its appearance. He also developed a basic housing project called Solwood Houses. Following his retirement from practice, Natusch remained active as a heritage advisor to Heritage New Zealand, a role that he began in the late 1960s. In the 2003 New Year Honours, Natusch was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to architecture. Natusch died on 30 September 2020, aged 99.

The hamlet consists of two separate settlements of Bagpath and Newington Bagpath, although residents of both frequently refer to both as Bagpath. The hamlet falls under the authority of Cotswold District Council and is represented by the Conservative MP, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. The hamlet is sparsely populated with a population of about 100, and a small number of farms. Almost all of the area is pasture or woodland. History A variation in spelling \\"Neunton & Pagpath\\" appears in 1418, when William Stoke was the parson of the church.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/629; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/bCP40no629dorses/IMG_1714.htm ; 4th entry. William Stoke, parson, was acting as an Executor, with Thomas Frome, canon of Wells, for John Forstall Although the population is now only about 100, census records from the 1900s show it was once about 1,000. The parish had its own church and school, but the former school house is now a private home and, although in private ownership, the church is now abandoned. The parish of St Bartholomew was united with the neighbouring parish of Owlpen from medieval times to the late 19th century. The west tower is Norman work and the nave is medieval, with a chancel added by Samuel Sanders Teulon in 1858. The church was declared redundant in about 1973. Near the church is the site of a motte- and-bailey castle dating to the Norman era. The earthworks have an overall diameter of 150 ft. The mound rises to 4 ft above ground level and is surrounded by a ditch 5 ft below which fades out on the scarp side. There were indications of an entrance ramp on the north side. A pit dug into the top displayed rubble and possible vaulting. There is a rectangular building platform immediately to the north of the motte. The Revd Alan Gardner Cornwall of Ashcroft was rector of Bagpath in the early nineteenth century, and published a standard account of life in this rural area at that time. His sons, Clement Francis Cornwall and Henry Pennant Cornwall emigrated to British Columbia, Canada while it was still a British colony during the gold rush. There they established a ranch and constructed a 'stopping house', Ashcroft Manor, on the Cariboo Gold Trail above the later site of the small town of Ashcroft, British Columbia, built for travellers in search of gold, giving them a place to stay and stable their horses. Photographs and maps of Bagpath and the surrounding area are held in the town's museum. The nearby Monarch's Way long distance footpath is based on the route taken by King Charles II of England whilst on the run after defeat at the Battle of Worcester. In 2003 the local community were united in opposition to a PPG7 planning application for a large country house in the valley, which they argued would spoil the unique countryside in the area. Since then a number of community events have taken place, including what are intended to become annual events: the Bagpath street party and a fireworks display for local residents.

During the Gunboat War she captured three privateers and several merchant vessels. After the Napoleonic Wars she continued on active service until 1825, after which she served as a receiving or accommodation ship. She was eventually broken up in 1865. Design Sir William Rule and Sir John Henslow designed the Cormorant class as 16-gun ship-sloops. The first batch, ordered in 1793 was armed with 6-pounder naval long guns, but Egeria was one of the second batch, ordered in 1805, and carried 32-pounder carronades instead. She was rated as an 18-gun at first, but was later re- rated as a 26-gun sixth rate. Under the rating system of the day her number of guns could be largely nominal (in this case the number of long guns she would have carried had she been so-armed); the re-rating in February 1817 included her carronades in the total and did not involve any actual change to her armament. Service In March 1808 Egeria was commissioned in Lieth, for the North Sea, and under Commander Fizowen Skinner. In May, Commander Lewis Hole replaced Skinner. On 21 December 1808, Egeria captured the Danish 10-gun privateer Noesois, Giermund S. Holme, Master, off The Skaw and after a two- hour chase. She had a complement of 36 men, but had only 26 on board. She was one day out of Fredriksvern, without having taken anything. Neosis was offered for sale by auction on 29 March 1809 at Kingston upon Hull. On 2 March 1809 Egeria captured the Danish 6-gun cutter Aalborg, after the packet ship Lord Nelson had already engaged her. Aalborg had a crew of 25 men and was bound to Norway with army clothing. On the same day Egeria also captured the Frederica, Emanuel, Isabella, and Margaretta. Lloyd's List reported that Egeria had captured the Danish vessels: Frederick, Alberg, Emanuel, Isabella, and Nancy. The British gathered these, and some more Danish vessels that other British vessels had captured, in Gothenburg. The captured vessels left Gothenburg on 23 March and by early April most had arrived at British ports.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4341. On 24 July Egeria captured the Danish vessel Jagten Nicolini (or Jagten Nicolene). On 9 August Egeria recaptured the American ship Pompey. Six months later, on 5 February 1810, Egeria captured the Danish cargo vessels Rodefiord, Til Fredjchead, and Sechs Wenner. On 23 October Egeria recaptured the Swedish brig Hoffnung. On 12 March 1811, Clio, with Egeria in company, captured the Danish brig Krabbes Minde. On 28 November 1811, Egeria captured the Christiansand. Then two days later, Egeria left Leith to search for vessels from an inbound Baltic convoy. Early the following day, about 70 miles off St Abb's Head, she engaged and captured the Danish privateer cutter Alvor, of 70 tons. Alvor was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 38 men. She was 15 days out of North Bergen without having taken any prizes. Egeria, together with the 74-gun , the brig-sloop , and the hired armed ship Prince William left G√∂teborg on 18 December 1811 as escorts to a convoy of 15 transports and a fleet of merchantmen, some 120 sail or more. Four or five days later Egeria and Prince William separated, together with the vessels going to the Humber and Scotland, including most of the merchant vessels. The transports and a handful of the merchantmen proceeded with Hero and Grasshopper.Gentleman's Magazine (1812), p. 174. On 24 December Hero wrecked off Texel in a storm with the loss of all but 12 men of her 600 man crew. Grasshopper became trapped about a mile away where the Batavian Republic captured her.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.302‚Äì4. On 17 February 1812, Egeria captured the Danish ship Maria Bonaventura. Then a little over one month later, on 27 March, she captured the Caroline, the Falken and two vessels both named Einighed, while Plover was in sight. Post-war In December 1816 Captain Robert Rowley recommissioned her for the Newfoundland Station. In November 1819 Captain Henry Shiffner took command. She sailed back to England bringing with her many of the officers and men of Sir Francis Drake, which remained on station in a reduced state. Egeria was paid off in January 1820. Captain John Toup Nicolas was captain of Egeria from 5 January 1820 until 1823, at first at Newfoundland. There he served as a \\"naval surrogate\\" (judge), trying over 1000 cases.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.75=8. In May 1822 he returned to England. Egeria first formed part of the royal squadron that escorted the king on his visit to Scotland. She then served on anti-smuggling patrol. On 3 and 4 October 1822, Egeria, under the command of John Toup Nicolas, picked up at sea some spirits, tea and tobacco. In June 1823 she received a reward for the recovery. In November Nicholas commanded a small squadron, consisting of Egeria, , and the cutter , on the Tyne where he subdued \\"a spirit of insubordination among the keelmen.\\" He broke the strike by using the men of his squadron to man the keelboats and move the coal that had piled up out to the vessels that were waiting for it. Nicholas kept up the operation for six weeks. At one point Nicholas landed from his gig and seized six ringleaders who had been throwing stones and calling out insults. Eventually, he succeeded in talking with the strikers and agreed to take their complaints to the government himself if the grievances were justified. Shortly thereafter the strikers returned to work.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, p.79-83. The government, the merchants and the corporation of Newcastle all thanked him for this service.The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 189, p.665. Egeria was recommissioned in January 1823 under Captain Samuel Roberts, and she sailed for Newfoundland and the West Indies. She returned home and was paid off. Then, still under Roberts's command, she sailed for Barbados and Cartagena in January 1825. She returned home from Vera Cruz and Havana in July 1825.The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 31, p.428. Fate Egeria became a receiving ship at Devonport and then at Plymouth in June 1826. The Admiralty lent her to the breakwater department at Plymouth on 16 December 1843. She then became an accommodation ship in December 1845 and police accommodation in April 1860. She was finally broken up in 1865.

Landmarks Stapeley House is a small country house on London Road (at ) which was formerly the seat of the Folliott family; it is listed at grade II. Dating originally from 1778, it has three storeys and five bays in red brick. It was altered in the late 1840s by Anthony Salvin, who added a classical stone frontispiece and canted bay windows, and also laid out the gardens. It has now been converted into offices.Pevsner, Nikolaus & Hubbard, Edward (1971). The Buildings of England: Cheshire, p. 338 (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books) ()Robinson, John Martin (1991).

The population is included in the civil parish of Bagworth and Thornton. History Bagworth Colliery in 1990. The incline-keeper's house at the top of Bagworth incline in 1985, before it was allowed to fall down. There are records of the manor of Bagworth from the early 14th and early 15th centuries, when it was held by the same feudal lords as the neighbouring manor of Thornton. Bagworth Park is first recorded in 1279 under ownership of the Bishop of Durham. In 1318 Roger de Holland was given permission to fortify his property at Bagworth.Leicestershire Museums Archaeological fieldwork Group 2008, Monograph No 2, p.3 It is recorded under the ownership of Matilda Lovell in 1411. The Lovell family later sold the land to the Hastings family. Development of the site was granted to William, Lord Hastings by Edward IV in 1474 for \\"crenellation and emparkment of 2000 acres of land\\" along with the castle developments at Ashby de la Zouche and Kirby Muxloe but there is no indication of any building by Hastings on the site prior to his execution by Richard III in 1483. A later moated house was developed on the site by Sir Robert Banaster in 1616. In 1761 Baron Maynard funded the building and endowment of a village school for Bagworth. The then Viscount Maynard had the first shaft of Bagworth Colliery sunk in 1828 and, initially, the coal was carried to Leicester by road.Owen, C. (1984) The Leicestershire and South Derbyshire Coalfield, 1200-1900 Ashbourne: Moorland Publishing Company Ltd. In 1832 the Leicester and Swannington Railway was opened. It passed within of Bagworth and provided a railway station to serve the village at the foot of the rope-worked Bagworth Incline, and a convenient connection to the colliery at the top of the incline.Clinker, C.R. (1977) The Leicester & Swannington Railway Bristol: Avon Anglia Publications & Services. Reprinted from the Transactions of the Leicestershire Archaeological Society Volume XXX, 1954. The Midland Railway took over the Leicester and Swannington in 1845 and built a gentler graded deviation line which bypassed the old incline and opened a new Bagworth railway station north of the centre of the old village in 1849. The new station was renamed Bagworth and Ellistown in 1894 to reflect the nearby colliery village that had developed since Ellistown colliery was sunk in 1873. British Railways withdrew passenger services from the line and closed the station in September 1964. The railway remains open for freight. Bagworth Colliery was connected underground to Nailstone Colliery in 1966. There the coal was raised, washed, and transported by train back along a branch line to interchange sidings next to the site of Bagworth and Ellistown station. In 1980 the branch line from Nailstone colliery was replaced by a conveyor belt which transported the coal to a rapid loader to the north of the site of Bagworth and Ellistown station. The colliery closed in 1991 when economic reserves were exhausted and the rapid loader was demolished. In the 1990s BR planned to restore Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line passenger services through Bagworth as the second phase of its Ivanhoe Line project. However, after the privatisation of British Rail in 1995 this phase of the project was discontinued. In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£49 million proposal to restore passenger services to the line that would include reopening a station at Bagworth. Chapels Bagworth's Church of England chapel of the Holy Rood was a dependent chapelry of the parish church of Saint Peter, Thornton. In 1848 Holy Rood was described as having a Saxon door and that its walls bore the date 1637. In 1873 the entire church except for the tower was rebuilt in granite with limestone dressings, with buttresses banded with red brick and blue vitrified brick. In the 20th century the Victorian church and medieval tower suffered subsidence so in 1968 they were demolished. They were replaced with a new modern church building that is unusual in being built of CLASP prefabricated concrete panels. Holy Rood is now part of the Church of England parish of Thornton Bagworth and Stanton, which is part of a united benefice with the parishes of Copt Oak and Markfield. By 1848 Bagworth had also a General Baptists' chapel. Amenities Bagworth had a public house, The Maynard, opposite the former railway station. It was closed in 2008 due to a fire and has since been demolished to make way for development of a shop and houses. There were also 2 other public houses in Bagworth and they were The Barrel (closed in 1980s and demolished) and The Rose and Crown which is a private residence having closed in the first half of the 20th century. Bagworth Heath Woods is nearby.

The student radio station Bailrigg FM is named after the site.  History  Bailrigg was a hamlet in the township of Scotforth and in some early deeds it was described as a manor. Its 2,880 acres were owned by Count Roger Pictavensis and his family, and afterwards the title fell to Cockersand Abbey. The settlement gave its name to a local family, Roger de Bailrigg and his descendents. In 1469 the land was granted to John Gardiner, who endowed Lancaster Royal Grammar School, and it went through numerous owners subsequently. In 1887 it was purchased by Thomas Storey, who founded the Storey Institute. He died in 1898 and the estate passed to his son Herbert Storey. Herbert Storey had Bailrigg House, also known as Bailrigg Mansion, built between 1899 and 1902 by Woolfall and Eccles of Liverpool. The landscape around Bailrigg House was also reoriented, and additional aspects added, with some of the work done by landscape architect Thomas Hayton Mawson. In 1921, Storey moved to Wiltshire, and the estate was bought by James Travis-Clegg, who lived there until he died in 1942. In 1944, the estate was bought by Barton Townley, a local car dealer. He agreed to sell the estate to the City of Lancaster for ¬£50,000 in 1961, and eventually did so in 1963, in order to make way for the new University of Lancaster.McClintock, p. 13‚Äì5 The new university buildings were designed by Gabriel Epstein and Peter Shepheard.

For many years, Goregaon has served as a cultural and educational center for surrounding areas in the region. Situated near the Kal River, a tributary of the Savitri River. Goregaon enjoys an abundance of water and natural features. Goregaon is likely the ancient Hippokura (Ghodekula) trade centre mentioned in Ptolemy's writings (A. D. 150). Geography Goregaon is located in the south-west of India at . The average elevation is . Formerly known as Ghodegaon, Goregaon is an inland port in the Mangaon taluka. It lies near the Kal River, about northwest of Dasgaon and south of the Kal's junction with the Ghod River, at the tidewaters of the Savitri River. The town utilizes the Kal as a source of hydroelectric energy. Boats weighing approximately 12 tons (50 khandi) pass through Goregaon, but river travel has diminished in recent times. The Konkan-Goa State Highway has facilitated economic and easy transport of goods to all parts of the country. Demographics , Goregaon had a population of 7,155. Goregaon has an average literacy rate of 91%, higher than the national average of 82.4%; with 95.18% of the males and 87.76% of females literate. 10.34% of the population is under 6 years of age. History=As Ptolemy's Hippokura Ptolemy (Bertius's Edition, 198, 205) mentions two Hippokuras: one on the coast, the other inland. The inland Hippokura is believed to be the capital of Baleokuros, which Professor Bhandarkar, in a manuscript, identifies with the Vidivayakuras, a branch of the Satakarnis who ruled at Kolhapur. No name of Kolhapur resembling Hippokura has been discovered. Ptolemy lists Balipatna and Hippokura south of Symulla or Ceul. Of these, Balipatna is most likely Palepattan or the city of Pale, which is a modern village possessing Buddhist caves measuring approximately in length to the northwest of Mahad. Hippokura is supposedly Ghodbunder in Salsette. However, Ghodeganv seems more likely to be Ghodbunder, as its position is at the limit of navigation on the northern branch of the Banakot River, making it also a likely early center of trade. Hippokura was the headquarters of a small division until 1718 AD. Afterwards, it was ceded to the Pesava by the Habsi, and at that time was to have been burned more than once to the ground. Modern settlement Goregaon was originally called Ghodegaon, a name that was formed by combining the word ghode (meaning \\"horse\\") and gaon (meaning \\"village\\"). This name was used because Goregaon was a major trading center for horses under the rule of Chatrapati Shivaji. from Goregaon is the village of Ghodeghoom. In ancient times, warriors would train in Ghodeghoom and travel to Goregaon to purchase horses. Three lakes in Goregaon could provide the water needed for the horses in the market. The village has three water tanks dating back from the ancient times. They are: (1) Gaotalav occupying an area of ; (2) Visnu Talav, with a haud, or tank, in the center and occupying of land; and (3) Ram Talav spread over an area of . Due to the availability of water the Maratha armies used to camp at Goregaon, and the nearby villages of Vaki and Hindus. In 1826, Ghodegaon is mentioned as the terminus of two routes from Poona via the Dev and Kumbha passes. It has an outlying country town, or kasha, with 500 houses and 40 shops along with some temples and wells (Clunes' Itinerary, p. 40). Since 1955, a plan to supply water through pipes has been implemented at the cost of . The water supply is ensured by putting a dam across the river Kal half a mile upstream. The plan was approved in order to provide the village with electricity by the end of 1961. In memory of the late Vaman Malhar Joshi, a celebrated Marathi writer, a building was erected which houses a library called Jnyana Vikas Vachanalaya. It is recognised as the taluka library and contains many books in English and Marathi, along with daily and weekly newspapers and magazines. More recently, an NGO called SHARE (Services for the Health in Asian ÔºÜ African Regions) has set up its office in the Madina complex on Goregaon Shrivardhan Road, in Goregaon. Villagers from 5 talukas, including Mangaon, visit Goregaon to meet with SHARE officials. Temples Among the old temples in Goregaon, the temple of Mallikarjuna, or Siddhesvar, is thought to have been built approximately 800 years ago. The shrine is said to be self- originated or Swayambhu. Situated on the top of the hill and bordering the town on the north, it is in height. The Ganapati temple has a building that is unique in India due to the fact that the shrine's upper half is the body of a male and the lower half is that of a female. The temple of Vithoba is 200 years old and has fine specimens of sculptures and carvings on the pillars. The existence of Srichakra marks is another distinguishing feature of this temple. To the north of the town, on a descent, there is the dargah of Daud Malik, a well-known Muslim Fir. On the border of Goregaon is the Samaj Samata Mandir Hall, and Lord Buddha's Temple. The hall and temple are a beautiful example of Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava. It is said that the temple and Samaj Samata Mandir were built by Panchsheel Buddha Jana Seva Samiti's Goregaon Vibhag. The late Chandrakant Adhikari‚Äîadvocate; the first sarpanch of Goregaon village, serving for 12 years; colleague of B. R. \\"Babasaheb\\" Ambedkar, in his Khoti abolition movement; and Dalit Mitra awardee‚Äîwas a force behind the Samaj Samata Mandir and temple project. He devoted many years to this project, despite being over 75 years old. Since 1980, people from all castes and creeds have also contributed. The project and hall are useful for multiple purposes as they are located on the state highway to Shriwardhan. Education=Schools The Secular Education Trust, Goregaon, operates three schools: Zainab Tobaccowala Secular School (English medium) from 1st to 10th standard, Chandrakant Adhikari Vidyalaya (Marathi medium) from 8th to 10th standard, and Karuna Kindergarten (pre-school to kindergarten).

The 2016 legislation authorized the state to seek federal waivers necessary to allow the program to operate. Operational costs for the program and per member per month premium prices were not disclosed at that time. The proposal did not become law. With the support of DFL Governor Mark Dayton, Democrat legislators introduced a similar proposal in 2017. In 2018, the Dayton Administration estimated the average statewide cost of MinnesotaCare Buy-In to be $659 per person per month, or $7,908 per year, for a silver level health plan. Silver level plans generally qualify as high deductible health plans, with individual deductibles exceeding $3,000 and family deductibles exceeding $11,000. In comparison, for 2018, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated the average cost of a privately sold silver level health plan to be $326 per person per month, or $3,912 per year, with similar deductibles. To start the buy in program, Governor Dayton proposed spending roughly $100,000,000 in public funding for a financial reserve to back up the government-run insurance option. In addition, his administration estimated $13,000,000 in annual operating costs. Governor Dayton has argued the buy-in plans would be eligible for federal premium tax credits (PTC) for those under 400% FPG, but this would require federal approval from the Trump Administration. Healthcare experts suggest a buy-in plan would not meet the definition of a \\"health plan\\" under federal regulations and therefore would not qualify for PTC. Critics have expressed three primary concerns about the viability of a MinnesotaCare Buy-In. First, they argue low healthcare provider reimbursement rates set by the government for MinnesotaCare will result in few providers accepting patients with public option coverage. Were providers mandated to accept public option coverage, they argue rural hospitals and clinics would be driven to bankruptcy. Second, critics have questioned the feasibility of modifying the state-run MNsure marketplace to sell the buy-in plan due to MNsure's technological deficiencies. Third, critics question the affordability of a buy-in based on the Dayton Administration's premium estimate, which is more than double current premiums for comparable value plans in the private market.

Lee Kenagy Park, or just Kenagy Park as it is also known as, is a City Park located in Raytown, Missouri, US. This multi-purpose park can be found at 79th Street and Raytown Road. It includes many park amenities, and is often visited by Raytown locals. Recent renovations include a larger parking lot, a new playground, a soda machine, and a new entrance. Park amenities The park is very well equipped, and includes: six shelters, four lighted tennis courts, a Baseball field, and a walking track surrounding a Fishing pond. Also included are three playgrounds, and two enclosed restrooms. The most distinctive feature in this park may just be the skatepark, located on the southwest corner of the park. Skatepark A view of Kenegy Skatepark from atop the smaller roll-in ramp, looking south. The skatepark can date back to 2005, and was Raytown's first, and currently only, skatepark. It was built by American Ramp Company, based out of Joplin, Missouri. The park itself is constructed entirely of steel, atop a smooth surface concrete base. The park is mainly geared towards \\"vert\\" skateboarding, with two large quarter pipes, one five foot, and another six foot. Across from each quarter pipe is an equal sized roll-in ramp. The park also includes a pyramid with an attached four-stair and rail, and a smaller three-and-a-half foot tall spine. The park is not entirely in favor of ramps, there is also a descending square rail in the corner, away from the ramps, and easily accessible. Also on the opposite side there is a foot-high box, and a two-foot-high box attached to each other, for grinding and manual tricks. The park's set-up is hard to argue with, despite its flaws the park is very easy to get around. Some skateboarders complain that metal ramps effect performance, this is not true however. The only down-side, other than loud noise, is when the weather becomes hot, so do the ramps. The city is very serious about the skatepark, some call it \\"Raytown's test park\\", because they think if it works with the youth then a second, better skatepark may be in the near future. The park shows no signs of graffiti, and litter has been down to a minimum. After over two years, Raytown should be considering a new skatepark to put themselves in the skatepark scene.

Collegiate career George scored a career 37 touchdowns as a Husky, tying him with Joe Steele for a Husky record. His jersey #33 is also only 1 of 3 jerseys to be retired in Husky football history.

His first game was with the Los Angeles Wildcats in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; although he recorded 123 rushing yards, he also lost a fumble in the 17‚Äì7 loss. With the San Francisco Tigers at Kezar Stadium, Wilson had 87 rushing yards to Grange's 41 before suffering a head injury in the fourth quarter, while the Tigers won 14‚Äì7. Wilson also led all-star teams in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, agreeing to participate on the conditions that he be paid in advance and game organizers provided an offensive line that could hold off the Bears; he described Chicago as having \\"the biggest and best line I ever saw on a football field.\\" His teammates for the games consisted of players from the Waterfront Athletic Club who also worked as longshoremen. In Portland, Wilson only appeared on the field for six snaps before leaving prior to halftime in the 60‚Äì3 loss. While playing for Seattle, he injured his right leg while tackling Grange as the Bears won 34‚Äì0. Wilson's teammate Rollie Corbett broke his leg during the game, leading to Wilson, Grange, and Grange's agent C. C. Pyle setting up a fund to support him; the three donated $50 apiece. Later in January, Pyle approached Wilson about signing a contract with him worth $15,000. During the summer, Grange and Wilson collaborated on the movie One Minute to Play, with Wilson serving as the antagonist to Grange's team. Due to California's summer heat and the film being set in an autumn Midwest, the film studio struggled to find extras willing to dress in warmer clothing. To solve this, Pyle promoted the movie's climactic final game as a genuine exhibition game with fans dressed in fall attire being granted free admission. Pyle also enticed Wilson to join the first American Football League as a potential rival for Grange. Pyle named Wilson president of the league's traveling team, the Wildcats, for the upcoming 1926 AFL season. While Wilson was also nominally named the team's owner, Pyle and Grange actually paid the bills and filed the franchise's ownership papers. Based in Chicago and training in Rock Island, Illinois, Wilson's Wildcats finished fourth in the nine-team league, with Wilson among the leaders in rushing touchdowns.David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete, Year-by-Year History of Professional Football From 1892 to the Present (St. Martin's Press 1994) Upon the demise of the AFL, Wilson joined the Providence Steam Roller of the National Football League, for which he played for three years. The championship year of 1928 featured Wilson as he was credited with five touchdowns and four interceptions as the Steam Roller won its only NFL championship.

Wistert attended Carl Schurz High School in Chicago, but dropped out. He did not play football in high school. After leaving high school, Wistert worked in a factory for several years. With the income from his factory job, he helped pay for his younger brother, Albert, to attend the University of Michigan. His mother later recalled, \\"He told me he'd stay out of school for a few years and work so Albert, the baby boy of the family, could go on to school.\\" In 1940, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, spending four years overseas during World War II. Wistert later recalled that he was often confused with his brother Al Wistert who played both college and professional football. In 1982, he told an interviewer that an officer approached him in 1944, \\"shook my hand and said 'I saw you play in Philly and at Michigan.'\\" When Wistert explained that it was his younger brother Albert who had played football, the officer \\"wiped off his handshake, turned on his heels and walked away.\\" According to Wistert, \\"that so affronted me that I wrote my kid brother and said I'm going to try to get back to school.\\"(Chapter on Wistert begins at page 222) College athletics Wistert from the 1950 Michiganensian After his discharge from the Marine Corps, Wistert worked for Procter & Gamble Soap Company in Massachusetts. He learned that Boston University was offering high school equivalency tests that would allow him to enroll there. Using the post- war G.I. Bill, Wistert spent one semester at Boston University and played for the school's football team as a 30-year-old freshman. After one semester at Boston University, Wistert transferred to the University of Michigan. He was the last of the Wistert brothers to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team where he, like his brothers Francis and Albert before him, wore number 11, which was retired by the University of Michigan but will be re-issued starting November 10, 2012, before a home game against Northwestern as part of the new Michigan Football Legend program. In the spring of 1947, Wistert won the Meyer Morton Award as the most improved player during Michigan's spring football practice. Wistert played defensive left tackle for the undefeated 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team that became known as \\"The Mad Magicians\\", and is considered to be the greatest Michigan football team of all time. Wistert later recalled the tight competition to play for the 1947 team: \\"There were players of almost equal ability on the first two teams. You had to play at your peak because there was someone who could always step in. Also, there was a good balance. A good mixture of youth and maturity.\\" At 230 pounds, Wistert was the largest player on the 1947 Michigan team. In addition to being the largest player, he was also the oldest. Wistert recalled, \\"When I played football for Michigan in 1947, opponents would say, 'Here comes Pappy and his kids again.' I was a 30-year-old college freshman. I was 13 years older than some of the other players.\\"(Chapter on Wistert starts at page 71) As a junior, Wistert was selected as a consensus All-American while playing for the undefeated 1948 Michigan team that finished the season ranked #1 in the Associated Press poll. In October 1948, Michigan helped secure Michigan's 19th consecutive victory with a blocked punt at the 12-yard-line of the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Michigan recovered the ball at the one-yard line and scored a touchdown on the next play. The 1948 team also set a Rose Bowl record defeating U.S.C. 49-0. After the 1948 season, Wistert was unanimously chosen as the team captain of the 1949 team. He was selected as a consensus All- American for the second straight year in 1949. When Wistert played his final game for Michigan in November 1949, the Detroit Free Press offered to fly his mother, Josephine, to the game to watch her son play. She had never seen one of her sons' football games in person but listened to the games on the radio. She declined the invitation, noting that she had been ill would listen to the game on the radio while looking at her sons' pictures. Interviewed by Lyall Smith, she expressed her particular pride for Alvin's accomplishments: > I am the proudest mother in the world. But I am proudest of all about Alvin. > It hasn't been easy for him to go to school, you know. He had the hard way > and that's why I am so happy his teammates made him captain this year and > that he was picked by you sportswriters as an All-America ...(accessible > through paperofrecord.hypernet.ca with subscription) The Sporting News published a photograph in December 1949 of Wistert's mother \\"Cheering Alvin's Final Game\\" while listening on the radio with a Michigan pennant and photographs of her three sons visible in the background. Wistert was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973 as the third Wistert brother so honored. In 1981, he was also inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in the fourth class of inductees alongside his brothers. Only five Michigan football players earned this honor before him. Later life and family After graduating from Michigan, Wistert worked in the insurance business. In 1950, he was employed as a general agent for Federal Life & Casualty in Ann Arbor. He later worked as a manufacturer's representative. In November 1982, the 66-year-old Wistert was working as a sales representative for Owens-Illinois. He lived in Northville, Michigan, in his later years and died in October 2005 at age 89. Wistert had two daughters and four grandchildren. His only grandson, Jason Alvin Neeser, played basketball at Dartmouth College.

In brief, the Banach‚ÄìStone theorem allows one to recover a compact Hausdorff space from the algebra of scalars (the bounded continuous functions on the space). In modern language, this is the commutative case of the spectrum of a C*-algebra, and the Banach‚ÄìStone theorem can be seen as a functional analysis analog of the connection between a ring R and the spectrum of a ring Spec(R) in algebraic geometry. Statement For a topological space X, let Cb(X; R) denote the normed vector space of continuous, real-valued, bounded functions f : X ‚Üí R equipped with the supremum norm ‚Äñ¬∑‚Äñ‚àû. This is an algebra, called the algebra of scalars, under pointwise multiplication of functions. For a compact space X, Cb(X; R) is the same as C(X; R), the space of all continuous functions f : X ‚Üí R. The algebra of scalars is a functional analysis analog of the ring of regular functions in algebraic geometry, there denoted \\\\mathcal{O}_X. Let X and Y be compact, Hausdorff spaces and let T : C(X; R) ‚Üí C(Y; R) be a surjective linear isometry. Then there exists a homeomorphism œÜ : Y ‚Üí X and g ‚àà C(Y; R) with : g(y)  = 1 \\\\mbox{ for all } y \\\\in Y and :(T f) (y) = g(y) f(\\\\varphi(y)) \\\\mbox{ for all } y \\\\in Y, f \\\\in C(X; \\\\mathbf{R}). The case where X and Y are compact metric spaces is due to Banach,Th√©or√®me 3 of while the extension to compact Hausdorff spaces is due to Stone.Theorem 83 of In fact, they both prove a slight generalization‚Äîthey do not assume that T is linear, only that it is an isometry in the sense of metric spaces, and use the Mazur‚ÄìUlam theorem to show that T is affine, and so T - T(0) is a linear isometry. Generalizations The Banach‚ÄìStone theorem has some generalizations for vector-valued continuous functions on compact, Hausdorff topological spaces. For example, if E is a Banach space with trivial centralizer and X and Y are compact, then every linear isometry of C(X; E) onto C(Y; E) is a strong Banach‚ÄìStone map. More significantly, the Banach‚ÄìStone theorem suggests the philosophy that one can replace a space (a geometric notion) by an algebra, with no loss. Reversing this, it suggests that one can consider algebraic objects, even if they do not come from a geometric object, as a kind of \\"algebra of scalars\\". In this vein, any commutative C*-algebra is the algebra of scalars on a Hausdorff space. Thus one may consider noncommutative C*-algebras (or rather their Spec) as non-commutative spaces. This is the basis of the field of noncommutative geometry.

He was born in Dresden and showed an early aptitude for music, which his family apparently discouraged. But he secretly left Dresden to follow Handel, a friend of his reputed father, to London. There, through Handel's good offices, he came under the protection of Frederick, Prince of Wales, who ultimately stood sponsor to his eldest son. In 1731 Reinhold, described as Reynholds, was singing at the Haymarket Theatre. He sang in the first performance of Handel's Arminio at Covent Garden on 12 January 1737, and created principal parts in many of Handel's operas and oratorios. Reinhold was one of the founders, in 1738, of the Royal Society of Musicians. When vocal music was added to the other attractions of Vauxhall Gardens in 1745, Reinhold was one of the first singers engaged. He died in Chapel Street, Soho, on 14 May 1751, and on 20 May Garrick lent his theatre for a benefit performance for his widow and children. According to some older sources including the Dictionary of National Biography (1885‚Äì1900), Reinhold was reputed to be the natural son of the \\"archbishop of Dresden\\". However, Dresden was not the seat of a catholic archdiocese or diocese at that time. His son, Frederick Charles Reinhold, was a famed singer.

College athletics After graduating from Chicago's Schurz High School in 1929, Wistert attended the University of Michigan where he was a star athlete in both football and baseball from 1931 to 1933. The Wistert brothers of Michigan Wistert was the first of three brothers to play for Michigan. The other two are Al Wistert and Alvin Wistert. All three Wistert brothers wore number 11 for the Wolverines football team, and all three were All-Americans. Interviewed by The Detroit News in 2004, Alvin recalled: \\"And if I'm not mistaken I think this is unprecedented in the annals of college football: that three brothers all would go to the same school, all played football. All played tackle, all wore the same number 11, all made All-American. Two of us played on four national championship teams. And all were inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\\" The Wistert brothers grew up on the northwest side of Chicago and were the sons of a Lithuanian family. Their father was a Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War veteran who was later killed in the line of duty while working for the Chicago Police Department. According to brother Alvin Wistert, their father \\"was born Casmir Vistertus and he Anglicized it when he came to America to Wistert.\\" The story of the Wistert brothers at Michigan began when Whitey's Carl Schurz High School classmate John Kowalik was invited to visit the University of Michigan. At the time, Whitey Wistert \\"was working in a factory building Majestic radios.\\" Kowalik took Whitey with him on his visit to Ann Arbor, and according to Alvin, \\"that's how it started: the Wisterts of Michigan.\\" Football As a football player, Wistert played for consecutive undefeated national championship teams in 1932 and 1933 and was a consensus All-American in 1933. The 1934 University of Michigan yearbook, the Michiganensian, included the following quote from Grantland Rice: \\"Wistert was unanimously selected as the best tackle in the Middle-West this year. He was the key to Michigan's defensive line play. He was a sure tackler and it was next to impossible to fool him on trick maneuvers. He was keen, quick, and accurate in diagnosing plays.\\" Wistert and Chuck Bernard were the leaders of the 1933 offensive line when the team went 7‚Äì0‚Äì1 with a tie to the Minnesota Golden Gophers. One of Wistert's teammates on the 1932 and 1933 Michigan football teams was future U.S. President Gerald Ford. In an interview in the February 1974 issue of \\"Michigan Alumnus\\", Wistert said of Ford: \\"He was a real good competitor ‚Äì a real bulldog type. Even during a losing year, he was voted MVP by his teammates. They felt he was one guy who could stay and fight for a losing cause.\\" In 1936, he was a member Michigan football coaching staff under Coach Harry Kipke. Baseball Wistert also earned varsity letters in baseball three years and was selected as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference in 1934. The 1934 Michiganensian yearbook reports that the final game of the baseball season was a 4‚Äì0 shutout by Wistert against the University of Chicago Maroons. \\"Wistert, for the Wolves, allowed only five well-scattered hits during the game. Although Whitey Wistert walked four men, he more than off-set this by striking out nine of the Maroons to face him.\\" Wistert also pitched a four-hitter against Ohio State. Honors Wistert was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967, one year before his brother Albert. In 1981, he was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fourth class of inductees alongside his brothers. Only five Michigan football players earned this honor before him. Professional baseball Wistert had a short cup of coffee in Major League Baseball, appearing in three games for the Cincinnati Reds between September 11, 1934 and September 25, 1934. In two appearances as a pitcher, Wistert allowed only one run in eight innings, for a career ERA of 1.13. The only career earned run he ever allowed came off the bat of a 17-year old phenom who was also a Chicago Public Schools alum in Phil Cavarretta of his hometown Chicago Cubs, who hit his first career home run in the 2nd inning of a 1-0 Reds loss. In three plate appearances, he went hitless and struck out twice. Although he only played briefly at the major league level, Wistert played five years of professional baseball. Fellow 1933 Michigan Wolverines football All-American, Ted Petoskey also debuted for the Reds in September 1934. Late life After retiring from sports, Wistert became a New York lawyer. He went on to become a vice-president of an industrial relations firm in Toledo, Ohio. He served in the United States Navy as a lieutenant during World War II.

Ballingdon came to be home to many businesses, evidence of which can be seen in the architecture of the buildings, with large shop windows and other tell-tale signs.

Ballingdon was home to two brickworks, long since vanished, but location maps of them can be found online.

Michigan's Fielding H. Yost called Wood in 1929 the greatest passer he had ever seen. In Wood's senior year, 1931, he was team captain. In one noted game, Harvard came back from a 13-0 deficit to beat Army 14-13 as Wood led two touchdown drives, and made two crucial defensive plays (a touchdown-saving tackle and an interception) to save the win.Bernstein, Football: The Ivy League Origins, p. 149‚Äì151 (excerpt available at Google Books).

Wood was at the center of a controversy involving the famous sportscaster Ted Husing. Commenting on Wood's poor play in the 1931 Harvard- Dartmouth game, Husing opined, \\"Wood is certainly playing a putrid game today.\\" Two plays later, Wood threw the winning touchdown pass in Harvard's 7‚Äì6 win.

Wood was well known for his role in Harvard's rivalry with Yale, which was led by its own three-sport star, Albie Booth. In the words of the 1931 Time article, \\"the essence of Harvard football this year, as Booth has been the essence of Yale football since his sophomore year, is William Barry Wood Jr., called \\"Barry\\" by sportswriters and \\"Bill\\" by friends.\\" When the two met for the first time as freshmen, Yale's freshman team beat Harvard's 7‚Äì6.

Plot For the centenary of the death of Fergus Kilpatrick, an Irish nationalist hero who led a group of Irish conspirators, and was assassinated in 1824, a descendant called Ryan is preparing a biography. Kilpatrick was killed in a theatre by unknown assailants, with a letter on his body warning him he faced death and after a soothsayer had predicted his end. Spotting these parallels with Shakespeare's plays, Ryan discovers that the oldest of the conspirators, Nolan, was the translator of Shakespeare into Gaelic. Eventually, Ryan works out that the nationalists knew they had been betrayed to the British authorities and Kilpatrick admitted he was the informer. After sentencing him to death, Nolan agreed to make his passing a memorable event in Irish history. So Nolan hastily faked the Shakespearean echoes and out of a sordid plot a hero was born. Ryan decides to leave the myth intact. Literary and philosophical references In addition to the plays Julius Caesar and Macbeth, with often heavy irony Borges links his story to many predecessors. Among them are: *Moses, who preceded Kilpatrick as a leader who saw the promised land of freedom for his people but had to die before it was reached. *Hesiod, Vico and Spengler, who saw human history not as linear progress but as a spiral of descent. *Caesar, who saw the British Isles under the grip of obscurantist druids. *Leibniz, who saw the cosmos as an ultimate harmony. *Lincoln, who followed Kilpatrick in becoming a national hero murdered in a theatre. *Browning and Hugo, who in their works celebrated perceived nationalist heroes. *Chesterton, who like Borges enjoyed creating involuted but symmetrical mysteries. Film adaptation In 1970 the story was adapted into an Italian film called Strategia del ragno (The Spider's Stratagem), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. In this version, the conspirators had planned to blow up the Duce Mussolini in 1936 during a performance of Rigoletto.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary =of British Names (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 10. is a coastal village in south Devon, England. It is in the South Hams district and lies on the estuary of the River Avon a quarter of a mile from the sea at Bigbury Bay. History Originally a fishing village, it was first documented as a port selling tin and various tin-made products to the Gauls during Roman times. During their occupation, the Romans built a large settlement to protect the entrance to the river at Bantham Ham, behind the dunes and to the west of the current village. The settlement, with evidence of an associated seasonal trading market, existed well into post-Roman Britain times. Later covered by sand, the settlement is known to have existed from the mid-18th century, after storms uncovered its burnt remains. As the landowners drained the local marshes during the 19th century, the workers were in part rewarded by being allowed to take the recovered human bones away and sell them. Since 1978, extensive archeological excavations have tracked the extent of the settlement, and it is now a scheduled ancient monument protected by English Heritage. Between 1750 and around 1880, it became a regional centre for the pilchard trading industry during the Cornish pilchard-boom. During this time, the extensive regional stocks of pilchards were processed at salting plants in Cornwall, and then shipped to the Roman Catholic countries of France and Spain. From there, there were either consumed locally or traded directly to Italy ‚Äì still the primary market for salt pilchards today ‚Äì where they were used in rustic dishes to give flavour to the staple diet of pasta or polenta. Due to over-fishing, as the trade quickly died the village went into steep decline. Evans Estates and ownership Post his World War I duties, in 1919 Lt Cdr Charles Evans bought the defunct village smithy. Having fallen in love with the place, in 1922 he bought the entire village, including over of surrounding land on both sides of the river. After World War II the family placed the estate into a private limited company, Evans Estates (1956) Limited, which today owns most of the village (consisting of 40 homes, a pub and a shop), the harbour, Bantham beach and an 18-hole cliff-top golf course. The family have always tightly managed the village, offering manageable rents, and neither renting out property seasonally nor allowing second or holiday homes. In light of rising costs, and requests from beach visitors, the company board agreed the introduction of both a Gastrobus (as opposed to a large caf√©), and the lease of the surfing rights to the beach to a surf school. It has since been reported, that the decision and resultant reaction by some residents was the key-driver behind the family in November 2013 deciding to sell the village from May 2014, with an estimated price of ¬£11.5M. The estate was sold in its entirety in July 2014 to a private family, who pledged to \\"continue to manage and conserve the Estate in the same manner as [the Evans family] have done for the next 100 years.\\" Present The village has a privately owned beach which is popular with surfers, and is backed by dunes. The beach offers views of nearby Burgh Island. The river Avon can be crossed via a seasonal pedestrian ferry. This operates between 10 am and 11 am and again between 3 pm and 4 pm on Monday ‚Äì Saturdays from late April to late September. The ferry costs ¬£2.50 each way and is popular with walkers on the South West Coast Path as it avoids the need to walk around the Avon estuary.

The village lies at by the junction of the A51 and B5071 roads, 3¬Ω miles to the south east of Nantwich and 4¬Ω miles to the south of Crewe. The civil parish also includes the small settlement of Hussey's Nook. The total population is just under 130 people. Sand has been extracted at Hough Mill Quarry. The remainder of the parish is predominantly agricultural. Nearby villages include Hatherton, Stapeley and Wybunbury. History Pasture near Oat Eddish Farm A denarius, a silver Roman coin, was found in the parish, but there is no other evidence of Roman occupation. There might have been a Saxon farmstead in the area of Oat Eddish farm, whose name derives from Old English and means \\"enclosed land where oats are grown\\". Walgherton appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Walcretune\\" and was held by William Malbank. During the Second World War, there was an anti-aircraft battery in the parish, documented in 1941‚Äì42. Governance Walgherton is administered jointly with the adjacent parish of Hatherton by Hatherton & Walgherton Parish Council. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 Walgherton falls in the parliamentary constituency of Crewe and Nantwich,Cheshire County Council: Interactive Mapping: Crewe and Nantwich (accessed 27 January 2009) which has been represented by Kieran Mullan since 2019, after being represented by Laura Smith (2017‚Äì19), Edward Timpson (2008‚Äì17) and Gwyneth Dunwoody (1983‚Äì2008). Geography, economics and transport The A51 (London Road) runs from the north east to the south west through the parish and is crossed by the B5071 (Crewe Road‚ÄìWybunbury Lane), which runs south west to north east to Wybunbury; the village is centred at the junction. Back Lane connects the A51 and B5071. The National Cycle Network route 70 follows the B5071 and two legs of the \\"A Walk around Wybunbury\\" footpath cross the parish. Forge Brook Howbeck and Wybunbury Brooks form part of the parish's northern boundary, and are crossed by the A51 at Howbeck Bridge. Another brook runs north west to south east through the parish and forms a short stretch of the south-western boundary. Forge Brook forms part of the eastern boundary. The main land use is agricultural. The terrain is predominantly gently sloping with steeper stream valleys; the low point of 45 metres is at Howbeck Bridge in the west, and the terrain slopes upwards towards the east, south and north of the parish with multiple high points of around 75 metres. There are several small areas of woodland, including Ballaglass, George's Wood, The Oaks, Perry's Rough, Speakman's Moss, Sprinks, Walgherton Pool and part of Jerusalem, and multiple small meres and pools lie within the woodland as well as scattered across the farmland. The Hough Mill Quarry (used for sand extraction) is in the east of the parish, by Back Lane, and includes an unnamed pool. Dagfields Craft Centre is off Crewe Road. Demography According to the 2001 Census, the parish had a population of 121,Neighbourhood Statistics: Walgherton CP (accessed 12 August 2007) increasing to 128 in 56 households at the 2011 Census. This represents a decline from the population of 1851, possibly in part caused by boundary changes; historical population figures are 211 (1801), 213 (1851), 178 (1901) and 199 (1951). The population density was 0.4 persons/hectare in 2011, well below the average of 3.2 persons/hectare for Cheshire East. Landmarks Gate lodges to Doddington Hall The Cottage and Thatchers, both on London Road, are two half-timbered cottages dating from the 17th century, which are listed at grade II, the lowest grade. The paired former gate lodges of Doddington Hall stand on Crewe Road near Walgherton village. Constructed in yellow sandstone, they are by Samuel Wyatt, also the architect of the hall, and date from the late 18th century. They are also listed at grade II. The Boar's Head public house stands in Walgherton village. Education As of 2016, there are no schools within the civil parish.

Radioecology arose in line with increasing nuclear activities, particularly following the Second World War in response to nuclear atomic weapons testing and the use of nuclear reactors to produce electricity.  History  Artificial radioactive affliction to Earth‚Äôs environment began with nuclear weapon testing during World War II, but did not become a prominent topic of public discussion until the 1980s. The Journal of Environmental Radioactivity (JER) was the first collection of literature on the subject, and its inception was not until 1984.S.C. Sheppard, An index of radioecology, what has been important ? ; Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, Volume 68, Issue 1, 2003, Pages 1-10. As demand for construction of nuclear power plants increased, it became necessary for humankind to understand how radioactive material interacts with various ecosystems in order to prevent or minimize potential damage. The aftermath of Chernobyl was the first major employment of radioecological techniques to combat radioactive pollution from a nuclear power plant.J. Hilton, Aquatic radioecology post Chernobyl‚Äîa review of the past and a look to the future ; Studies in Environmental Science, Volume 68, 1997, Pages 47-73Sir Frederick Warner (Editor), Roy M. Harrison (Editor), Radioecology After Chernobyl: Biogeochemical Pathways of Artificial Radionuclides (SCOPE Series) Chernobyl radiation map 1996 Collection of radioecological data from the Chernobyl disaster was performed on a private basis. Independent researchers collected data regarding the various dosage levels and geographical differences among the afflicted areas, allowing them to draw conclusions about the nature and intensity of the damage caused to ecosystems by the disaster. These local studies were the best available resources in containing the effects of Chernobyl, yet the researchers themselves recommended a more cohesive effort between the neighboring countries to better anticipate and control future radioecological issues, especially considering the ongoing terrorism threats of the time and the potential use of a \\"dirty bomb.\\"M√òLLER Anders et MOUSSEAU Timothy A.

Radioecologists evaluate the effects of both natural and artificial radioactivity on the environment itself as well as dosimetrically on the human body. Radionuclides transfer between all of Earth‚Äôs various biomes, so radioecological studies are organized within three major subdivisions of the biosphere: land environments, oceanic aquatic environments, and non-oceanic aquatic environments.Radioecology: To understand the evolution of radioactivity in the environment, IRSN Corporate Publications: IRSN's thematic booklets, 2001, Page 2  Scientific Background  Nuclear radiation is harmful to the environment over immediate (seconds or fractions thereof) as well as long-term (years or centuries) timescales, and it affects the environment on both microscopic (DNA) and macroscopic (population) levels. Degrees of these effects are dependent on external factors, especially in the case of humans. Radioecology encompasses all radiological interactions affecting biological and geological material as well as those between different phases of matter, as each is capable of carrying radionuclides. Occasionally, the origin of radionuclides in the environment is actually nature itself, as some geological sites are rich in radioactive uranium or produce radon emissions. The largest source, however, is artificial pollution via nuclear meltdowns or expulsion of radioactive waste from industrial plants. The ecosystems at risk may also be fully or partially natural. An example of a fully natural ecosystem might be a meadow or old-growth forest affected by fallout from a nuclear accident such as Chernobyl or Fukushima, while a semi-natural ecosystem might be a secondary forest, farm, reservoir, or fishery that is at risk of infection from some source of radionuclides.R.W. Mayes (1989), The quantification of dietary intake, digestion and metabolism in farm livestock and its relevance to the study of radionuclide uptake ; in Transfer of Radionuclides to Livestock (Oxford, 5‚Äì8 September 1988) ; Science of the Total Environment ; Vol 85, September 1989 ; (abstract) Basic herbaceous or bivalve species such as mosses, lichens, clams, and mussels are often the first organisms affected by fallout in an ecosystem,D. Jackson, A.D. Smith (1989) Uptake and retention of strontium, iodine and caesium in lowland pasture following continuous or short-term deposition ; Pages 63-72, in Transfer of Radionuclides to Livestock (Oxford, 5‚Äì8 September 1988) ; Science of the Total Environment ; Vol 85, September 1989 (abstract) as they are in closest proximity to the abiotic sources of radionuclides (atmospheric, geological, or aquatic transfer). These organisms often possess the highest measurable concentrations of radionuclides, making them ideal bioindicators for sampling radioactivity in ecosystems. In the absence of sufficient data, radioecologists must often rely on analogs of a radionuclide to attempt to evaluate or hypothesize about certain ecotoxicological or metabolic effects of rarer radionuclides. In general, techniques in radioecology focus on the study of environmental bioelectromagnetism, bioelectrochemistry, electromagnetic pollution, and isotope analysis.  Radioecological Threats  Earth in the 21st century is at risk of the accumulation of nuclear waste as well as the potentiality of nuclear terrorism, which could both lead to leaks. Radioactivity originating from the Northern HemisphereBennett, A. Bouville, Radiation doses in countries of the northern hemisphere from the chernobyl nuclear reactor accident ; Environment International, Volume 14, Issue 2, 1988, Pages 75-82 B.G. is observable dating back to the mid-20th century. Some highly toxic radionuclides have particularly long radioactive half-lives (up to as many as millions of years in some cases), meaning they will virtually never disappear on their own. The impact of these radionuclides on biological material (correlated with their radioactivity and toxicity) is similar to that of other environmental toxins, making them difficult to trace within plants and animals. Fort-greely-low-level-waste Some aging nuclear facilities were not originally intended to operate as long as they have, and the consequences of their waste procedures were not well understood when they were built. One example of this is how the radionuclide tritium is sometimes released into the surrounding environment as a result of nuclear reprocessing, as this was not a foreseen complication in the original waste management orders of operations. It is difficult to diverge from these procedures once a reactor has already been put to use, since any change either risks releasing even more radioactive material or jeopardizes the safety of the individuals working on the disposal. Protection of human well-being has been, and remains to this day, paramount in the aims of radioecological research and risk assessment. Radioecology often calls into question the ethics of protecting human health versus the preservation of the environment in the interest of fighting extinction of other species,R.J. Pentreath, Radioecology, radiobiology, and radiological protection: frameworks and fractures ; Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, Volume 100, Issue 12, December 2009, Pages 1019-1026 but public opinion on this matter is shifting.Antoine Debauche, Continuous radioactivity monitoring systems.

Biography Born in Naples, Giulio died in FerraraRose 1857, p. 387. or Rome, where he painted for the last twenty years of his life. He initially trained under Luca Giordano. His adherence to the pictorial manner of the master was such that some of his copies of Jordanian compositions (battles, above all) were sold as original works of the same Giordano. But in 1692, when the former left to work in Madrid, he entered the studio of the Neapolitan Francesco Solimena.Biography .De Dominici 1846, p. 553. He painted a Virgin and Child, with Angels and Saints in Glory for the church of the Carmelitani in Sorrento. For a church of Vico, he painted a canvas of St Ciro and Giovanni and the Virgin. He painted two canvases, one of a Miracle of St Dominic and the Apparition of the Virgin to the Shepherdess, for the church of Rosariello delle Pigne, outside of the Porta di Gennaro. He also made copies of Giordano and Solimena for export.De Dominici 1846, p. 554. Towards the end of the second decade of the eighteenth century he moved to Rome, though he maintained close contacts with the Neapolitan artistic environment. Of the long activity in Rome, which he mainly dedicated to portraiture, one should pay attention to The Glory of St. Anna in the ceiling of the church of St. Francesco da Paola, a St. Joseph in the same church and a St. Albert Caring for the Sick in St. Maria di Montesanto. Only the first of these works has come to the present day, having lost the others in an indeterminable period. His elder sibling was, reputedly, Giulio Giacinto Avellino, also a painter, born in 1645. By 1718, he had transferred to Rome, where he was influenced by Carlo Maratta. The frescoes on the vault of San Francesco di Paola ai Monti in Rome are by Onofrio. He painted an altarpiece on the San Alberto heals the sick for the church of Santa Maria in Montesanto.

He was the youngest brother of Cesare, Giovanni, and Lucrezia Borgia.  Early relations  Gioffre married Sancha (Sancia) of Aragon, daughter of Alfonso II of Naples, obtaining as dowry both the Principality of Squillace (1494), and after a period of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Naples, the Duchy of Alvito (1497). Gioffre and Sancha were 12 and 16, respectively, at the time of their marriage. The marriage was a political one. Alfonso married his daughter to Gioffre and gave the over-large dowry in return for Pope Alexander's recognition of Alfonso's claim to the throne of Naples. Almost as soon as the wedding ceremony was over, the political situation changed with the invasion of Italy by King Charles VIII of France, who claimed Naples as his own. Alfonso fled, leaving the throne to his short-lived son, and a long war between Spain, France and their Italian adherents ensued. During this time the young couple lived mostly at Rome, where Sancha reputedly had affairs with both of her husband's elder brothers, Giovanni and Cesare, among others. In the beginning of their marriage, Sancha was somewhat domineering over her husband (due to his age) and she sought after older men. Gioffre's relationship with his father was poor. Pope Alexander VI legitimized him, but privately expressed doubts that Gioffre was his son. He considered him a weakling because of his lack of interest in politics. In 1497 the Pope publicly exonerated Gioffre of the murder of his brother Giovanni Borgia, 2nd Duke of Gandia because of the many rumours that Cesare was in fact the killer, due to public antagonism between the two over Sancha.  Later life  During the War of 14991504, when Louis XII of France attempted to conquer Naples, Gioffre sided with the French; but when he was captured by Prospero Colonna he changed sides to join the Spanish, which caused a rebellion in Alvito. In 1504 he sent the condottiero Fabrizio Colonna to stabilise his lands, partly paid for with money he had appropriated from the papal treasury after the death of his father the year before. With the rebellion crushed, Gioffre finally moved to his estates in Alvito and Squillace in 1504. Two years later Sancha died childless. Consequently, the Spanish King of Naples, Ferdinand II of Aragon, took possession of Gioffre's estates in Alvito. However, Gioffre was able to retain Squillace, on the Calabrian coast, which he ruled as a feudal vassal of Naples. Gioffre's second marriage was to one of his cousins, Maria de Mila of Aragon. They had a son, Francesco, and three daughters: Lucrezia, Antonia and Maria Borgia. Francesco inherited his father's lands and the title of Prince of Squillace. Gioffre's descendants ruled the tiny city of Squillace until 1735. They generally ruled through governors, since they resided at either Naples or the Spanish court. Representations in popular culture= Art  Pinturicchio's \\"Disputation of St Catherine\\". Gioffre and Sancha are generally thought to have been the models for the boy and girl in the artist Pinturicchio's 'Disputation of St Catherine', where they are depicted as a young couple in love.

History  The clinic originally was opened as a full-service hospital for the town of Whitby on December 17, 1969, named the Dr. J.O. Ruddy General Hospital. The complex was a combined medical and psychiatric hospital, the first in North America. The hospital maintained a high ranking from the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation since it was first surveyed in 1971, receiving a four-year 'distinction' accreditation in 1995. The hospital was renamed Whitby General Hospital in 1987. In 1998 the hospital, along with Memorial Hospital Bowmanville, North Durham Health Services, and Oshawa General Hospital, were placed under the administration of the Lakeridge Health Corporation, an amalgamation completed under the Common Sense Revolution of the Mike Harris administration. The government had created the Health Services Restructuring Committee and, under their recommendation, the Lakeridge Corporation was to place the town of Whitby under the service of Lakeridge Health Oshawa and would close Whitby General. However, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care reversed this decision in 2001 and allowed the complex to stay open, albeit not as a full-service hospital but a specialty clinic.  Recent history  The clinic currently offers palliative care, dementia care and dialysis services to the Durham Region. Other services, such as the day hospital, offer rehabilitation to those who have suffered from strokes or brain injuries. A 16-bed geriatric assessment unit was opened in 1999, which was later expanded to 32 beds in 2003. This unit offers continued, low-intensity rehabilitation for elderly individuals. A July 2, 2007 electrical fire forced the clinic to cancel over 20 surgeries and move their 71 patients to Lakeridge Oshawa. Though the clinic was scheduled to re-open in autumn of the same year, services would not resume until April 2011.  Proposed re-opening  Recent population growth in Durham has caused some to call for the re-opening of the clinic as a full service hospital, a movement garnering support from both municipal and provincial levels. A review of the current site found that as the building was created for Whitby in the 1960s, the current patient capacity would be unable to support the town's current population. In addition, to bring the building to healthcare and building codes, the review found that extensive renovations must be made to the building structure, interior structure, mechanical systems and upper levels. The town of Whitby has therefore proposed a new hospital in the recently developed north Whitby, to service the town and north Oshawa. As a short-term solution, a February 2006 request for $17.5 million for the current location's infrastructure was submitted by the Lakeridge Corporation to the Ministry of Health. In November 2007, Liberal health minister George Smitherman remarked that he was not committing himself to a new hospital in Whitby. He added that Whitby should seek funds for the hospital from MP Jim Flaherty, as it under was Flaherty that the hospital closed.

The exterior, red brick and largely clad in cream-colored Masonite, is similarly striped with redwood battens that emphasize the low- slung lines. The front of the house has one story, while the rear, because of the sloping site, has two. The roof is made of terne. At the time of construction, the components of the house cost $20,000 and assembly cost a further $35,000.

Operation After most of Gornji Vakuf was captured by the ARBiH in August 1993, the fighting turned towards Prozor where Croat and Bosniak forces fought during the previous months in nearby villages. Neither had full control of the area so both sides spent August and September in fighting along the hills and ridges near Prozor. In September 1993, the Bosnian Government mounted the Neretva Operation, one of its most complex efforts to date, against the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). Units from the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) were subordinated to Sefer Haliloviƒá for the operation. The ARBiH troops launched coordinated attacks against Croat-held enclaves in the La≈°va Valley and on the entire confrontation line from south of Gornji Vakuf to Jablanica, through Mostar and further southward to the Buna River. Units of the 9th Brigade, the 10th Brigade and the 2nd Independent Battalion, all subordinated to the ARBiH 1st Corps, were sent from Sarajevo to the Jablanica sector. In the Vitez area, during a simultaneous attack from the north and south, at one point the ARBiH broke through HVO lines in Vitez, but were ultimately forced back. Between Prozor and Jablanice, the ARBiH pushed the confrontation line slightly to the west and advanced south toward Mostar after several days of fighting. The focus of the ARBiH attack was the HVO stronghold of Vrdi near the Neretva River in order to gain control of northern and western approaches to Mostar. In September 1993, after an artillery bombardment of Vrdi, the ARBiH infantry unsuccessfully attacked it and HVO forces managed to repel the attack. In Mostar, the ARBiH and HVO forces had clashes in the city and its Bijelo Polje and Ra≈°tani suburbs. The ARBiH made some limited gains by attacking outward from the city in three directions. The HVO responded with artillery shelling on 23 September of the eastern part of the city, controlled by the ARBiH, and an ineffective counterattack on 24 September. The use of artillery by the ARBiH and HVO further damaged the city, but neither side made significant gains. After several days of negotiations, a cease-fire was agreed on 3 October. Grabovica and Uzdol massacres During the night of 8/9 September, the massacre in Grabovica occurred when at least 33 Croat villagers in Grabovica were killed by members of the 9th Brigade and unidentified members of the ARBiH. Three combatants, Nihad Vlahovljak, Haris Rajkiƒá and Sead Karagiƒá were convicted for taking part in the killings. A few days later on 14 September, the ARBiH mounted an offensive east of Prozor. During this offensive the Uzdol massacre occurred in the village of Uzdol. 70-100 Bosnian troops infiltrated past the HVO defense lines and reached the village. After capturing the HVO command post the troops went on a killing spree. It was reported that 29 Croat civilians and one prisoner of war were killed by the Prozor Independent Battalion and members of the local police force. ARBiH commander Sefer Haliloviƒá was indicted by International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on the basis of superior criminal responsibility (Article 7(3) of the Statute of the Tribunal) and charged with one count of violation of the laws and customs of war (Article 3 ‚Äì murder), and found not guilty. Aftermath The HVO retained control over the area around Prozor and secured its forces rear in western Mostar. The ARBiH managed to secure ground between Jablanica and Vrdi and take control over the road from Grabovica through Potoci and Vrapƒçiƒái into northeast Mostar.

However today some of that industry has switched to salmon farming or aquaculture. Of late aquaculturists in Maine are most concerned about the outbreak of Infectious Salmon anemia(ISA) in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. The Canadian and US salmon raising industries in the bay are geographically near one another and are therefore ecologically integrated. Machias Bay, which is 50 miles west of the Bay of Fundy, is also a location of salmon raising in Maine close to the Bay of Fundy. History The Maine aquaculture industry has grown dramatically in the past decade. In 1988 the harvest collected approximately 1 million pounds of salmon and trout at 10 sites, while just four years later this had grown to 10 million pounds of harvested salmon alone. This growth in Maine mirrors growth of the industry worldwide. Farmed salmon production worldwide increased from 47,000 tons to 550,000 tons during the years from 1985 to 1995.Aquaculture in Maine In 1995 Maine comprised approximately 1.8% of the total world production of salmon. In 1997 the Maine aquaculture industry produced 22.5 million pounds of salmon from 27 sites for a total of $50 million. In 1998 it was 24 million pounds of salmon worth about $60 million. Salmon producers in Maine indicated to the Maine Department of Marine Resources that they are committed to increasing production up to 50% in the next few years. Economics Maine accounts for 18% of the US domestic salmon market. Within the state of Maine, the salmon industry provided close to 1000 jobs in 1996. The vast majority of these jobs are in Washington County. The industry in 1996 accounted for \\"$30 million of personal income and $44 million of goods and services produced in Maine (gross regional product). In 1998, the Maine salmon industry had an estimated economic value of $60 million. For comparison, the Maine dairy and potato industries each had an estimated economic value of $90 million in 1998.\\" See below, Karlsen. One company, Atlantic Salmon of Maine LLC produces about 7,000 tons of farmed salmon. Design and consulting firm, Innovio Labs (ILGC) has made forecasts that would suggest significant growth in the industry due to rising global demands. References * Jarp J., Karlsen E.

Brew is capable of playing both in the centre and on the wing.  Career = Early life  Brew was born in Cardiff, but moved back to his mother's home town of Brynamman when he was six, around the time his brother Aled was born. Brew was brought up as a Welsh speaker.  Club career  Newport RFC = Brew began his professional rugby career at Newport RFC, signing for the Black and Ambers when he was still only 19. He made his debut for the Rodney Parade club in a Celtic League match at home to Edinburgh on 1 September 2001. He had to wait nearly six months, however, to score his first try for the club, eventually crossing in a WRU Challenge Cup match against Bonymaen RFC. Brew was then not selected and did not play again for Newport for almost a year. He made his comeback appearance on 8 February 2003 against Bedwas RFC, again in the WRU Challenge Cup, and followed this up by scoring a try in a Welsh Premier Division match against Cardiff RFC on 25 April. = Newport Gwent Dragons = Before the start of the 2003‚Äì04 season, regional rugby was introduced to Wales, and Brew made the move to the Newport Gwent Dragons regional side. He was selected for the Dragons' first match in the revamped Celtic League, an away match against the Llanelli Scarlets. Brew made 25 appearances in all competitions in the 2003‚Äì04 season, scoring three tries along the way. However, these three tries did not come until the last three games of the season, which perhaps was a reflection on the brand of rugby the squad played. The 2004‚Äì05 season was slightly hit and miss, with Brew only making 17 appearances and scoring just two tries before an injury to his groin (which seemed to be pretty common amongst the Welsh squad during this period with such players as Shane Williams and Barry Davies having similar operations) in March which ruled him out for the rest of the season. Brew returned to the Dragons side just before Christmas 2005 in good form; he scored four tries in the 12 appearances he made that season and earned himself a late call-up to the Welsh squad for their tour of Argentina. After being deployed mainly as a winger for the majority of his Dragons career, Brew moved into the centre for most of the 2006‚Äì07 season where he demonstrated perhaps that this was his best position. It was his ability to create space from the centre that helped Brew scored all of his five tries that season, as well as landing one drop goal in an EDF Energy Cup match against the Northampton Saints. An ankle injury kept Brew out of the Dragons team for four months from December 2006 to March 2007. = Scarlets = In February 2007, it was announced that Brew had signed a two-year contract with the Llanelli Scarlets for the 2007‚Äì08 season. The transfer came as a surprise to many Welsh rugby and Dragons fans, due to Brew being a real crowd pleaser at Rodney Parade. Brew made 12 starts for the Scarlets in his time at Stradey Park, before his contract was terminated by mutual agreement on 5 December 2008. Which was partially due to lack of game time opportunities created as a result of the tremendous form of Regan King. = Bristol = On 18 December 2008, Brew signed for English Premiership side Bristol. He had a spell with Bristol earlier in his career, before he signed for Newport in 2001. =Neath RFC=Newport Gwent Dragons= In August 2010, Brew rejoined the Newport Gwent Dragons on a one-year contract.Nathan Brew rejoins Newport Gwent Dragons from Neath ‚Äì BBC Sport He was released by Newport Gwent Dragons at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season.  International career  Brew has only ever made one appearance and benched twice for the Welsh national team, making a try-scoring debut in an Autumn Test against Romania at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. He has been a part of two Welsh tours the first being in 2004 to South Africa and the second when he was selected for the tour to Argentina whereby he was selection on the bench for the second Test. Brew has also turned out several times for the Welsh national team at a number of different levels. He began his international career when he played for the Welsh Senior Schools side, before moving on to the Under-19 and Under-21 sides. Since then, Brew has been involved with the Welsh Sevens team.  Personal life  Brew's brother, Aled, currently plays as a winger for Bath Rugby, and has also appeared for the Welsh national team. Aled was on loan at the Newport Gwent Dragons during the 2006‚Äì07 season and lined up alongside his brother on a number of occasions.

Kramer and popularized in his 1993 book Listening to Prozac, refers to the use of drugs to move persons from a normal psychological state to another normal state that is more desired or better socially rewarded ‚Äî e.g., from melancholy toward assertiveness and confidence or from slower to quicker cognition. The comparison is with surgery in which the same intervention can be therapeutic (as for reparative work on burn victims) or cosmetic (as in rhinoplasty for the enhancement of beauty in conventional terms). In general, cosmetic psychopharmacology refers to the use of psychoactive medications by normal healthy individuals, for the purpose of enhancement rather than treatment of a formal pathology. Kramer reported that with the antidepressant Prozac occasional patients seemed \\"better than well,\\" and he discussed the ethical dilemmas that might result were similar medications offered to individuals not afflicted with psychiatric disorders. Following these case reports, much controversy arose over the veracity and ethics of the cosmetic use of actual antidepressants and other similar medications. Opponents of cosmetic pharmacology believe that such drug usage is unethical and that the concept of cosmetic pharmacology is a manifestation of naive consumerism. Proponents, such as philosopher Arthur Caplan, state that it is an individual's (rather than government's, or physician's) right to determine whether to use a drug for cosmetic purposes. Anjan Chatterjee, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, has argued that western medicine stands on the brink of a neuro-enhancement revolution in which people will be able to improve their memory and attention through pharmacological means. Jacob M. Appel, a Brown University ethicist, has raised concerns about the possibility of employers mandating such enhancement for their workers.

The village lies on the Shropshire Union Canal, north west of Barbridge Junction (at ), and is 4 miles to the north west of Nantwich, and the parish also includes part of the small settlement of Wardle Bank. The total population is around 250. RAF Calveley was a flight-training station during the Second World War, and the Mark III radio telescope stood on the airfield site in 1966‚Äì96. The modern civil parish includes Wardle Industrial Estate and is otherwise largely agricultural. Nearby villages include Barbridge, Calveley and Haughton. History Derelict buildings of RAF Calveley Watfield Pavement, a stone road believed to have originally formed part of a Roman road from Chester to Chesterton in Staffordshire, passed through or adjacent to the parish,King et al. 1778, p. 263 and a bronze Roman coin was found nearby. Wardle appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Warhelle\\". Wardle Hall was the seat of the Prestland family, passing to the Woodhey branch of the Wilbraham family in the early 17th century.Gastrell 1845, p. 218 A map dated around 1875 shows brickworks and brick fields adjacent to the Shropshire Union Canal, and mills and a brickworks were present in this area on a 1947 map. RAF Calveley airfield, completed in 1942, served as a flight-training centre during the Second World War. The RAF station closed in 1946, but it remained in use as an airfield until 1959. Several of the buildings have survived, including the control tower, hangars and a Romney hut. The Mark III radio telescope was constructed in 1966 on the base of a former hangar at the airfield.Cheshire Federation of Women's Institutes 1990, pp. 16‚Äì17Lovell 1985, p. 12 It had an elliptical meshwork dish measuring . Controlled from Jodrell Bank Observatory, near Holmes Chapel, it initially worked in concert with the Mark II telescope, 24 km away at Jodrell Bank, and later formed part of what is now the MERLIN network of radio telescopes. The Mark III telescope was dismantled in 1996. Governance Wardle is administered by the Wardle Parish Council. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 Wardle falls in the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury, which has been represented by Edward Timpson since 2019, after being represented by Stephen O'Brien (1999‚Äì2015) and Antoinette Sandbach (2015‚Äì19). Geography and transport The Shropshire Union Canal and the A51 (Nantwich Road) run side by side across the parish from the north west to the south east, and they form part of its northern boundary. The Shropshire Union's Barbridge Junction lies towards the south east of the parish; from the junction, the Middlewich Branch initially heads north east and then turns to run east‚Äìwest. The Crewe‚ÄìChester railway line also runs broadly east‚Äìwest across the north east of the parish. The A51 crosses the Shropshire Union mainline at Wardle Farm Bridge to the north west of Wardle village; Calveley Hall Lane diverges adjacent to this bridge, to run northwards over the railway line and through Wardle Bank to the parish of Calveley. The Weaver Way footpath loops through the south east of the parish, following the Shropshire Union and Middlewich Branch canal towpaths. Industrial estate, from the A51 The terrain is flat, with an average elevation of around 55 metres. Much of the area to the south west of the Shropshire Union/A51 is an industrial estate, accessed via Green Lane. The remainder of the parish is predominantly agricultural. The woodland of Hill's Gorse lies in the north east of the parish, and Wardle Covert, part of Long Wood and several smaller areas of woodland are in the west of the parish. Two water bodies lie between Wardle Covert and the Shropshire Union, and numerous small meres and ponds are scattered across the farmland. Demography According to the 2001 Census, the parish had a population of 181, increasing to 254 in 112 households at the 2011 Census. This represents an increase from the 19th-century population but a decline from the population of 1951; historical population figures are 115 (1801), 178 (1851), 193 (1901) and 285 (1951). The population density was 0.3 persons/hectare in 2011, well below the average of 3.2 persons/hectare for Cheshire East. Pasture north of Wardle village Landmarks Wardle Old Hall, a red-brick former farmhouse dating from the early 18th century, stands by the canal. The oldest listed building in the civil parish, it is decorated with prominent pilasters and is listed at grade II* for the \\"high quality of the Baroque facade\\".Hartfield et al. 2011, pp. 656‚Äì57 Two canal bridges are listed at the lower grade of II: Roving Bridge at Barbridge Junction and Rutter's Bridge over the Middlewich Branch; both date from around 1830 and were probably designed by Thomas Telford. The Canal House, of a similar date and also listed at grade II, stands at the junction, and the Jolly Tar public house is nearby. The grade-II-listed Wardle Bridge Farmhouse, built by John Tollemache, Baron Tollemache, of the Peckforton estate in around 1860, has decorative timberwork and octagonal-latticed cast-iron windows. A grade-II- listed, red-sandstone pinfold stands by the A51; used to confine straying cattle, it dates from the early 19th century and is one of the few examples to have survived in Cheshire. Education As of 2016, there are no schools within the civil parish. Wardle falls within the catchment areas of Calveley Primary Academy in Calveley for primary education and Tarporley High School in Tarporley for secondary education.

Life He was born in the parish of St. Clement Danes, London, the eldest son of Christian Reisen, a goldsmith, of Trondheim in Norway. The elder Reisen, leaving Norway, visited Scotland about 1664, and worked for two years at Aberdeen for a goldsmith named Melvin. In September 1666 he came to London, and began to work as an engraver of seals. He was afterwards confined to the Tower for four years on suspicion of engraving dies for coining, but was discharged without a trial, and died in England about 1700, leaving a widow and several children. Charles Christian Reisen, who had been instructed as a gem and seal engraver under his father's instruction, became the support of the family, being mainly employed in cutting crests and arms. He gained little from an introduction to Prince George of Denmark, but attracted the attention of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, who permitted him to study in his library and museum. In course of time Reisen formed a collection of medals, prints, drawings, and books, and was chosen director of Sir Godfrey Kneller's academy. On the trial of Bishop Francis Atterbury, he was examined as an expert as to the impression of a seal. Horace Walpole was another of his patrons, and for him he made several cornelian intaglios. Reisen received commissions from Denmark, Germany, and France, as well as from Englishmen. Horace Walpole called him \\"a great artist\\", but Charles William KingAntique Gems and Rings, p. 445 considered his intaglios deficient in finish. Among Reisen's intaglios - he did not attempt cameos - were specimens bearing the heads of Faustina the Elder, Faustina the Younger, Lucilla, Charles I of England, and Charles XII of Sweden. Glaus (d. 1739), Smart, and Seaton are named as his pupils. George Vertue describes Reisen as a jovial and humorous man who, being illiterate, had, by conversing with men of various countries, \\"composed a dialect so droll and diverting that it grew into a kind of use among his acquaintance, and he threatened to publish a dictionary of it\\". Reisen was usually known in England as 'Christian' and 'Christian's mazzard' was a joke among his friends. Sir James Thornhill drew an extempore profile of him, and Matthew Prior added the distich: > This, drawn by candle light and hazard, Was meant to show Charles > Christian's mazzard. A portrait of Reisen was painted by John Vanderbank, and was engraved by Freeman in Walpole's 'Anecdotes'. Other engravings by Bretherton and G. White are mentioned by Henry Bromley. Reisen died of gout on 15 December 1725 in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden, London, where he had chiefly lived, though he had also (about 1720) a house at Putney, nicknamed 'Bearsdenhall'. He was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, on the north side next to the steps. He appointed his friend, Sir James Thornhill, one of his executors, and, dying a bachelor, left the bulk of his fortune to an unmarried sister who lived with him, and a portion to his brother John.

' (English: \\"'Welcome money\\") was, from 1970 until 29 December 1989, a gift from the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) to visitors from the German Democratic Republic (GDR - East Germany). This situation originated with the policy of the GDR government restricting the amount of East German Marks (M) that could be exchanged into Deutsche Marks (DM) by GDR citizens when on approved travel to the West. At first, the GDR allowed the exchange of 70 M annually into DM, however by 1989, this sum was reduced to 15 M annually, which greatly restricted the ability of GDR citizens to travel to the West, even if they were approved to do so. Originally, every GDR citizen was entitled to a \\"welcome money\\" payment of 30 DM twice annually; by 1988, this had been increased to a one-time payment of 100 DM annually, which was recorded in their travel documents.

It is in the civil parish of Barton-upon-Humber. Barton Waterside consists of the former port area at the north end of Barton-upon-Humber. The Community is centred on Barton Haven - a late Anglo-Saxon artificial harbour - which was dug c.1000 AD to create a reliable deep water port for the extreme north of Lindsey. It seems possible that the project was initiated by Peterborough Abbey which had interests in the parish at that time. Barton-upon Humber was a medium-sized port in the early Middle Ages with the majority of the commercial activity being concentrated at the head of Haven close to Fleetgate and the modern day railway station. Barton declined as a port after the foundation of Kingston upon Hull c. 1300. By 1550 the port was of only local significance. The oldest building presently surviving within the area is the Waterside Inn (now Waterside House) built in 1715. This was the southern terminus for the ferry to Hull until it ceased running in the 1850s. This building is about one-third of its former size due to the demolition of the former hotel c.1860. In the early nineteenth century a daily mail coach ran from Barton Waterside via Brigg to Lincoln. After the introduction of paddle steamers c. 1818 a three or four times daily service between Barton and Hull left from a long wooden pier at the bottom of Waterside Road at a place locally called Point. This pier was later used by the Coastguard Station which closed in 1927, after which it was removed although the foundations of the pier can still be seen at low tide. As river traffic increased in the late 18th and 19th centuries Barton became a local port serving the river trade along the Humber, Trent, and Ouse, and the North Sea Coastal trade. Houses were built along the road leading to the Ferry eventually creating a thriving suburb with its own industries, shops, pubs, schools and churches. In the 19th century there were two whiting works, and three mills west side of Barton Haven. East of the Haven were two brickyards, Hall's Ropery and the Maltings. Brown and Clapson's shipyard which opened in the 1870s, survives today as Offshore Steel Boats. At various times there were coal staithes, a petroleum depot, and various other wharves and business along the Haven. These industries created a tight knit community of boatmen, shipwrights, loose hands and factory workers distinct from the town of Barton- upon-Humber. In addition to the various places of employment, three pubs existed on the Waterside in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries - the Royal Vaults at the corner of Hewson (or Vaults) Lane and Waterside; The Sloop Inn at the corner of Far Ings Lane and Waterside, and the Waterside Inn (called \\"Bottom Pub\\" by locals) opposite the old ferry landing. There were also eight shops of which only one survives today. The two places of worship in Barton Waterside were St Chad's Mission Church (Anglican), and the Wesleyan Mission. There was also St. Chad's C of E School which operated from 1904 until 1967. Scholars of this institution were referred to locally as \\"Chad- Rats.\\" The school building had served as St. Chad's Mission and Sunday School from 1894 to 1906 replacing an earlier (1863) Mission Room on the east side of the Haven. The Wesleyan Mission operated from 1876 to c.1955. The buildings are now a house and a bicycle showroom. Since the 1950s, Barton Waterside has gradually declined into a residential area at the North end of Barton-upon- Humber. Most of shops, and businesses have closed. The Sloop Inn survives, along with the Shipyard. Commercial river traffic in and out of Barton Haven ceased c.1981 with the opening of the Humber Bridge. The last barge to operate regularly in and out of Barton Haven was the former Humber keel the \\"Hope\\" which brought raw materials to Hall's Barton Ropery. The last major Community Building - St Chad's Mission Church - closed in 1977.

Pgs 127-8 To the west of Round Wood in a grass meadow are the remains of three brick drying houses. There are also numerous foundations of buildings by the river Rib and the remains on the concrete bridge. On the other side of the river Rib, on the factory site, there still exists some of the yellow brick factory buildings. Alongside the left-hand side of the factory runs the Barwick tributary. From the bridge there, on the right-hand side of the bank, lies one of the millstones used in the grinding process for the smokeless powder. All the residential building built in 1888‚Äì89 still stand.The Hertfordshire Mercury 8 June 1889 The Douglas fir trees that briefly line Barwick Lane were planted for Mr J.D. Dougall JR, in 1889, so he did not feel homesick for his native Scotland.The Hertfordshire Mercury 6 July 1889 The fields that run between the river Rib and residencies were used as a range, storage, testing/experimental work and disposal during S.P.C.'s and Sabulite's tenures.

S.P.C. ephemera, in general, is very scarce. A small quality of original boxes, cans and munitions were shown in an article written by Will Adye-White. Amenities Barwick is made up of private residences, a caravan park and industrial units. There are no bus service, shops, telephone boxes, post offices or churches in Barwick. Barwick's public house was purposely built for the munition workers. It was initially named 'The Factory Arms' but in circa 1904 the public house changed its name to The Duke of Wellington. The pub officially ceased trading in the late 1990s and is now a private residence.

The village lies on the River Wheelock (at ), to the north of Crewe, to the south of Middlewich and miles to the west of Sandbach. The parish also includes the small settlement of Lane Ends,Genuki: Warmingham (accessed 15 August 2007) with a total population of just under 250. Nearby villages include Minshull Vernon, Moston and Wimboldsley. The land is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, with a village being documented from the 13th century. The oldest surviving building dates from the late 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries the parish had a finery forge, which was among the earliest in the county. The area is agricultural, with dairy farming the predominant land use. The Northwich Halite Formation, a Triassic salt field, underlies the parish, and there is a long history of local salt production, with the Warmingham brine field remaining an important source of the mineral. Cavities in the salt-bearing stratum are used to store natural gas. Several flashes were created in the 20th century by subsidence after natural brine pumping in the area, some of which form part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The village maintains the tradition of holding a wake each May. History An Iron Age gold stater (coin) dating from around the end of the 1st century BC was found in the parish. One face depicts a horse, with a wreath on the obverse. An urn described as Roman, but possibly as early as the Bronze Age, was discovered in a burial mound near Forge Mill. There is no other evidence of Roman inhabitation at Warmingham, although the remains of a Roman road from Middlewich to near Nantwich pass around 200 metres away from the parish's north-west corner.Poole 2013, pp. 8‚Äì10 Warmingham is documented under Tetton in the Domesday Book of 1086. The medieval manor was granted to Randulphus. There is believed to have been a medieval church in the village, although only a cross base remains. The earliest recorded rector was in 1298. The land passed to the Mainwaring and Trussell families, and in the 16th century part was sold to Christopher Hatton. It then passed to Randolph Crewe, and remained in the Crewe family until 1918. The village school was founded in 1839.Cheshire Federation of Women's Institutes 1990, pp. 227‚Äì28Warmingham Village Plan 2006, p. 3 Brine pump near Hill Top Farm A prisoner-of-war camp was located at Donkinson's Oak, near the southern edge of the parish, during the Second World War, and there was a heavy anti-aircraft battery near Bottoms Farm in 1940‚Äì41. The village gained an electricity supply in the 1950s. The village post office and shop closed in the 1970s. Salt and other industries The Warmingham area has a long history of salt extraction. Brine from the parish's flashes is thought to have been used to make salt in Middlewich, an important salt-producing centre during the Roman occupation. Natural (uncontrolled) brine pumping at nearby Elworth, Ettiley Heath, Wheelock and elsewhere in the Sandbach area occurred from the 19th century, increasing sharply after the First World War, and was associated with subsidence in Warmingham and the adjacent parish of Moston from the 1890s. The Sandbach Flashes ‚Äì pools formed by subsidence from the underlying salt dissolving, accelerated by salt extraction ‚Äì first appeared in the early 1920s and were still expanding in the 1950s.Goodwin & Lythgoe 2000, pp. 6‚Äì7 Natural brine pumping ceased in the area in the early 1970s, and British Salt started to extract brine by the controlled pumping method, which prevents subsidence, at a site near Hill Top Farm in the early 1980s. The village had a corn mill from around 1289. A finery forge or smelting furnace was established on the River Wheelock north of the village in the mid-17th century, one of a handful in Cheshire at that date.Hodson 1978, p. 143 It was still in operation in around 1750, when its annual output of bar iron was recorded as 300 tons, more than any other Cheshire forge. The former corn mill was adapted to grind coconut shells for manufacturing plastics, and aircraft parts were made there during the Second World War. By 1990, the building had been converted into craft workshops, and it had been demolished by 2006. River Wheelock Governance Warmingham is administered by Warmingham Parish Council. From 1974, the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 Warmingham falls in the parliamentary constituency of Eddisbury,Cheshire East Council & Cheshire West and Chester Council: Interactive Mapping: Eddisbury (accessed 8 October 2016) which has been represented by Edward Timpson since 2019, after being represented by Stephen O'Brien (1999‚Äì2015) and Antoinette Sandbach (2015‚Äì19). Geology and geography Crabmill Flash The Northwich Halite Formation, a Triassic salt field, underlies the civil parish, with the 170‚Äì240-metre-thick salt-bearing layer lying around 180‚Äì250 metres below the surface. In the area of Hill Top and Hole House, sandy soil overlays red clay, with the base rock being Triassic sandstone‚Äìmudstone.Poole 2013, p. 7 The River Wheelock runs broadly north-west to south-east through the civil parish, with much of the parish lying in its valley. The ground is undulating with an average elevation of around 45 metres. Hoggins Brook, a tributary of the Wheelock, forms parts of the northern and western boundaries of the parish, and Fowle Brook runs north‚Äìsouth in the south-east corner. Crabmill Flash lies immediately north of the Wheelock at ; part of Elton Flashes lies in the east of the parish, and Bottoms Flash and part of Railway Flash lie in the south-east of the parish. These wetlands form part of the Sandbach Flashes, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a popular site for birdwatching.Goodwin & Lythgoe 2000, pp. 8‚Äì10 Numerous meres and ponds are scattered throughout the area, and there are several small areas of woodland in the north west of the parish, near The Old Hough. Warmingham Moss occupies the south-west of the parish. Economics The parish is predominantly agricultural, with dairy farming remaining the main land use.Warmingham Village Plan 2006, p. 2 Brine is extracted using controlled brine pumping by British Salt from the Warmingham brine field, located near Hill Top Farm to the west of Warmingham village, and is processed to make white salt at its Middlewich salt works. Warmingham is one of two major brine fields still being exploited in Britain (the other being the Holford brine field at Lostock Gralam, also in Cheshire). It supplies all of British Salt's brine, which is used to manufacture around half of the UK's pure salt output. Since 2003, EDF has stored natural gas in underground cavities created by dissolving salt near Hole House Farm, with a total storage capacity of .Evans & Chadwick 2009, pp. 69, 71‚Äì72 A second gas storage site has been constructed near Hill Top Farm, and is scheduled to start operating by the end of 2016. Demography According to the 2001 Census, the parish had a population of 175,Neighbourhood Statistics: Warmingham CP (accessed 12 August 2007) increasing to 244 in 92 households at the 2011 Census. This represents a decline from the population of 1851; historical population figures are 346 (1801), 423 (1851), 218 (1901) and 199 (1951). The population density was 0.3 persons/hectare in 2011, well below the average of 3.2 persons/hectare for Cheshire East. St Leonard's Church Places of worship The Church of England parish church of St Leonard's is in the centre of Warmingham village. The purple-brick church tower dates from 1715, and the body of the church was rebuilt in red sandstone in 1870, replacing an earlier timber-framed building; it is listed at grade II*.Hartwell et al. 2011, pp. 657‚Äì58 The base of a medieval stone cross, dating from around 1298, survives in the churchyard; it is listed at the lower grade of II, and is also a scheduled monument. Other landmarks Warmingham village was historically centred around Warmingham Bridge across the Wheelock, which falls within a conservation area that also includes St Leonard's Church, Church House, Hill Top Cottage, Mill House, Island House and the Bear's Paw Hotel, extending to cover earthworks east of the village centre. There are two separate sets of earthworks: one is at the site of the 13th-century watermill, and represents the dam, leat and mill pond; the other is a partially moated site associated with Sir John Trussel's manor house. The oldest surviving building in the civil parish, Church House, dates from the late 16th century and is listed at grade II*. It is partly red brick and partly half-timbered, with a typical Elizabethan fa√ßade combining close studding with decorative framing in a chevron pattern.McKenna 1994, p. 19 One former resident was John \\"Rebel\\" Kent, a supporter of Charles Edward Stuart (\\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\") in the Jacobite uprising of 1745. The red-sandstone Warmingham Bridge dates from around 1750 and is listed at grade II. The 19th-century Bear's Paw is the only remaining public house in the parish. Outside the village, there are two grade-II- listed, early-17th-century farm buildings, Old Hough Farm House and Mill Lodge, which each combine brick with timber framing. Both are off Forge Mill Lane in the north of the parish. Warmington Grange, off School Lane, is a grade-II-listed former rectory dating from the early 19th century, which served as a club and restaurant from the 1970s until 2005.Warmingham Village Plan 2006, pp. 6‚Äì8 Culture and community Church House The village maintains the tradition of holding Warmingham Wakes in early May; the event is now used to raise money for St Leonard's Church.Warmingham Village Plan 2006, p. 4 The village has an active Women's Institute, founded in 1948. The village hall on School Lane, originally an army hut, was renovated in the 1970s;Warmingham Village Plan 2006, p. 5 plans to build a new hall were ongoing in 2016. Transport Warmingham Road runs north‚Äìsouth through the parish, connecting Coppenhall Moss (in Crewe) and Lane Ends with Warmingham village, where it crosses the Wheelock and becomes School Lane. Hall Lane runs east from Warmingham Road to the parish of Moston. White Hall Lane runs north from School Lane, connecting with Forge Mill Lane which runs west to Occlestone Green, and Crabmill Lane runs south from School Lane to connect with Hall Lane in Moston. The West Coast Main Line railway runs north‚Äìsouth for a few hundred metres in the south-west corner of the parish, between the Crewe and Winsford stations, and is crossed by a footbridge. The Crewe and Nantwich Circular Walk runs east‚Äìwest through the south of the parish. The Cycling the Salt Ride cycle route runs along part of the eastern boundary, via Crabmill Lane. Education Warmingham Church of England Primary School is on School Lane in Warmingham village; it also accepts pupils from part of Minshull Vernon. For secondary education, the civil parish falls within the catchment area of Sir William Stanier Community School in Crewe.

Biography Erik Bodom was born in Vestby in Akershus, Norway. He was a pupil at the Oslo Cathedral School, but shortly left school to educate himself as a painter. He attended the Royal Drawing School, studying under Johannes Flintoe during 1847. He was a student of Hans Gude during 1848. In 1850, he traveled to D√ºsseldorf, where he made rapid progress. In 1852, he sold a landscape painting Aus dem Bondhusthal (From the Bondhusdalen), to Bridgewater Gallery in London. The following year, he became an honorary member of the Royal Academy in Amsterdam.Erik Bodom (Store norske leksikon. Frode Ernst Haverkamp) Bodom developed a distinctly romanticized form of landscape painting. He painted in a style similar to that associated with August Cappelen, who was noted for his melancholic and romantic landscape paintings. Bodom often featured scenes from the coniferous forests of Eastern Norway. The composition of such images frequently featured landscapes of forested hills and quiet ponds, often with a bewitching atmosphere using strong contrasts between light and dark. August Cappelen, Maler (Norsk biografisk leksikon. Holger Koefoed, forfatter av denne artikkelen) In 1862, Bodom established a permanent residence in Germany, That same year he visited Norway for the last time. He died in D√ºsseldorf. The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design is the owner of several pieces of his art including Fra Nordmarken (1857), Havneparti (1865), and Kystparti med bauta og vrak (1878).Erik Bodom, maler (Norsk kunstnerleksikon Ingrid Reed Thomsen, forfatter Gallery File:Erik Bodom.jpgNorwegische Sommerlandschaft (1854) File:Erik Bodom - Minnesteiner (1868).jpg Minnesteiner (1868) File:Erik Bodom - Ruhe nach dem Sturm (1871).jpg Ruhe nach dem Sturm (1871) File:Erik Bodom - Bondhusbreen i Sunnhordland (1878).jpg Bondhusbreen i Sunnhordland (1878) File:Erik Bodom - Norska kustlandskap 2 st (1878).jpg Norska kustlandskap 2nd (1878) File:Erik Bodom - Foss med sagbruk.jpg Foss med sagbruk (1878) Notes Sources differ regarding the date of his death.

It was the second short to be produced by Jones, but the fourth released. Plot The cartoon starts with Tom fishing on a pier. Tom baits the line with \\"cheese\\" and casts it all the way out to a far-off ship and into Jerry's mouse hole. The cat gets a bite and gets pulled off the pier and onto a pillar, while the sleeping mouse nibbles at the \\"cheese\\", not knowing it is actually rubber. Tom catches the mouse in a fish net and plops him onto the pier, waking Jerry up with a start. Jerry then gets a sense of his surroundings, and realizes that Tom is holding his tail and he is about to squash him with a hammer. The mouse substitutes the cat's hand for himself, and Jerry whistles at Tom from the closest pillar to alert him of his throbbing hand. Tom reacts by yelping and jumping into the stratosphere, kissing his hand all the while. Pleased with himself, Jerry starts to run back to another mouse hole while Tom nosedives after him like a plane landing. Jerry makes it to safety while the cat hits his head on the fence, just above the hole. Tom rounds a turn, and just as fast, stops and retreats behind the corner. The camera pans to Jerry, who is perched on top of a dog. He hides in the dog's mouth as Tom tries to catch him without waking up the dog. Instead of grabbing the mouse, however, Tom grabs the dog's tongue. Jerry has been pulled out as well and escapes, leaving the cat facing an angry and awake dog. Tom grins and rolls up the dog's tongue back into his mouth, then moves the dog's lips to change his expression to a smile. Tom then waves the dog goodbye and attempts to run away in fear. Not one to let Tom off so easily, the dog undoes his smile, grabs Tom's tail, rolls him up like a bowing ball, and bowls him through some garbage cans and into the water, where a crab pinches Tom's tail hard. Tom leaps out in pain and knocks the crab back into the water. Soon, Tom spots a smaller dog being chased by a dog catcher. Tom forcibly grabs the dogcatcher's net and drags him to the dog, who is captured instead, knowing that he is Jerry's protector. Jerry, who wants to be protected by the dog, angrily gets a saw in a tool shed, hides behind the fence, and cuts the shaft of the net as the dogcatcher passes by. In gratitude, the dog gives Jerry a whistle to use whenever he's in trouble. Jerry, with relish, thinks of the fun times he could have with provoking Tom. Jerry walks past a wooden box while Tom pokes his hand out of it and captures the mouse, who promptly whistles for his guardian. Tom is forcibly pulled through the knot hole and is being confronted by the mad dog. Tom grins, but soon his lips make a whistling gesture and he is exposed. The dog chokes Tom and the cat's mouth opens to reveal Jerry whistling on top of Tom's tongue. The mouse walks off and onto the dog's shoulder while the entire bowling sequence, complete with crab, is repeated. Finally, Tom sneaks behind the fence and leans over it to place earmuffs over the sleeping dog. However, his feet cause a board to creak out of place, leaving him dangling over the dog as it continues to fall. Tom saves himself by curling his tail around the foundation of the fence such that he and the board are pulled back up to the fence. Tom makes noises to test the earmuffs, and when the dog stays asleep, he happily goes off to corner Jerry. Jerry blows his whistle while Tom only looks more menacing than before, but then Jerry pulls out a pair of earmuffs for himself and continues whistling. Thinking that Jerry stole the dog's earmuffs, Tom gets so scared that he rolls himself into a ball and bowls off the pier, and even grabs the crab and attaches it to his tail. However, in the final scene, Jerry then puts that pair on as he lies down next to the dog (who still had his earmuffs on) to take a nap.

Fossils of Psarolepis have been found mainly in South China and described by paleontologist Xiaobo Yu in 1998. It is not known certainly in which group Psarolepis belongs, but paleontologists agree that it probably is a basal genus and seems to be close to the common ancestor of lobe-finned and ray-finned fishes.Benton, M. J. (2005): Vertebrate Palaeontology, page 65. In 2001, paleontologist John A. Long compared Psarolepis with Onychodontiform fishes and refer to their relationships. Description Psarolepis had a pair of 'parasymphysical tooth whorls', teeth which extend up at the front of the lower jaw. The head was made of several thick dermal plates and covered with deep pock-marks and large pores. Another trait is a large pectoral spine, just in front of the pectoral fin, extending back from the shoulder girdle, and a dorsal spine located in front of a median fin behind the head, which gives the fish a shark-like form. The pock-marked head of Psarolepis was made of plates containing a layer of porcelain-like cosmine. Because the cosmine layer obscures the suture lines of the skull, it is difficult to study the exact bone structure. The snout was strangely humped and the nostrils were located above the eyes, which were just above the upper jaw. The most spectacular findings were the fin spines. Two are known: one extending back from the shoulder girdle and another which is associated with the dorsal fin. These fin spines are found only in primitive jawed fishes and are apparently absent from the most primitive sharks, but present in abundance in more derived forms. Psarolepis had teeth at the very front of the snout with large fangs on the tooth plate. Outstanding feature are the 'parasymphysical tooth whorls' which place the fish in the order of onychodontida.Zhu; Yu; Janvier, 1999. The premaxilla and the dentary had large inner teeth and irregular array of tiny outer teeth. Discovery Location of Qujing Prefecture (yellow) within Yunnan province of China, where the fossils of Psarolepis were discovered. Most of the fossils of Psarolepis were discovered at the same locality of the Yulongsi, Xishancun and Xitun formations, about 10 km northwest of the city of Qujing, Yunnan, China. With this discovery other prehistoric lobe-finned fishes came to light such as Youngolepis and Diabolepis. The remains of Psarolepis were collected in 1981 and 1984 by paleontologist Min Zhu and colleagues and dated from Early Devonian and Late Silurian periods.Ahlberg, 1999. Other fossils, also dated from Late Silurian, have been found in Vietnam but the description of the fish was based on the materials from China because they were better preserved. History and classification Fish relationships and the ambiguous position of Psarolepis. The red arrow shows Psarolepis as basal lobe-finned and the green arrow locates the fish as the basalmost bony fish. When Psarolepis was described for the first time in 1998, it was placed in the group of sarcopterygians (lobe-finned fishes) because the skull and jaws resemble those of primitive lungfishes. In 1999 Zhu et al. were unable to locate Psarolepis in the cladogram because they did not know if it was the most primitive lobed- finned fish or the most primitive bony fish. There are some characteristics that bony fish do not have, such as the median spine located behind the head, which is known in sharks and acanthodians, and the pectoral spine extending back from the shoulder girdle which is found in some placoderms and acanthodians. Later, in 2001, Zhu and Schultze gave more basis to the theory that Psarolepis was probably a basal bony fish. The same year Long re-examined the phylogenetic position of the fish and pointed out several similarities between Psarolepis and Onychodontiform fishes.Long, 2001. He also noted that the presence of a rotational tooth whorl combined with the other characteristics in the skull, and possibly in the shoulder girdle, show that Psarolepis is better placed as a sister taxon to Onychodus as the most basal member of the group of Onychodontiforms. Moreover, Long, referring to new fossils collected from Gogo Formation, Western Australia, said that Psarolepis and Onychodus are both basal bony fish and are more primitive than other lobe- finned groups.

On his return to Genoa, he executed a portrait of the new Duke, Giovanni Battista Cambiaso.

K. Chambers in 1995 to refer to the once-widespread tenet of linguistic theory that in order to properly study language, linguistic data should be removed or abstracted from all real- world context so as to be free of any inconsistencies or variability. This principle was, for different theorists and schools of thought, taken as a prerequisite for linguistic theory,For example, in Chomsky (1965) or as a self-evident falsehood to be rejected.Such as Bakhtin (1986) It remains an influential idea in linguistics. History Ferdinand de Saussure divided language into two categories, langue (the abstract grammatical system a language uses) and parole (language as it is used in real-life circumstances). Historically, the range of language study had been limited to langue, since the data could easily be found in the linguist's own intuitions about language and there was no need to look at the often inconsistent and chaotic language patterns found in everyday society. In the 20th century, scholars began to further embrace the assumption that linguistic data should be removed from its social, real-life context. Martin Joos stated the axiom this way in 1950: > \\"We must make our 'linguistics' a kind of mathematics within which > inconsistency is by definition impossible.\\" (Joos 1950: 701-2) In 1965, Noam Chomsky offered a more substantial definition, incorporating his concepts of linguistic competence and linguistic performance, terms that closely parallel Saussure's langue and parole. > \\"Linguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal speaker-listener, in > a completely homogeneous speech-community, who knows its language perfectly > and is unaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions as memory > limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest, and errors > (random or characteristic) in applying his knowledge of the language in > actual performance.\\" (Chomsky 1965: 3) Around this time, several linguistic studies began to acknowledge not only the presence, but importance of variability found in speaker data. Instead of dismissing this variability on the grounds that the variants either belonged to different coexisting linguistic systems or demonstrated unpredictable free variation as had been done before, they recognized that it might be influenced by the speaker's circumstances. Sociologist John L. Fischer conducted one of the first systematic studies of language variation in 1958 to address variation in the speech of New England schoolchildren. Finding free variation to be an unsatisfactory explanation, he wrote: > \\"...Another sort of explanation is possible in terms of current factors > which lead a given child in given circumstances to produce one of the > variants rather than another.\\" (Fischer 1958: 47-8) Fischer eventually discovered a correlation between the linguistic variants and independent social variables such as class and sex. By gathering variable data and analyzing it, he proved that the inconsistencies were indeed manageable, resisting the axiom of categoricity's premise that the data be abstracted from social contexts in order to make it coherent and manageable. By invalidating this premise, it proved that acceptance of the Axiom of categoricity is not a requirement but rather an idealistic option that may or may not be useful to a study. Fischer's work created the basis for sociolinguistic analysis in the coming years, notably William Labov's studies in Martha's Vineyard and New York City during the 1960s. Acceptance in modern theory Despite its rejection by sociolinguists, the Axiom of categoricity is still an influential postulate in some schools of linguistics. Chambers claims that all the linguistic progress that was made when the axiom was the law remains successful and indisputable.

She had the dangerous task of supplying fuel and ammunition to ships in and near combat area. Allagash was laid down on 26 October 1944 at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Bethlehem Steel Co. under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 2559); launched on 14 April 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Reuben D. Vining; acquired by the Navy on a loan-charter basis on 21 August 1945; and commissioned that same day, Lt. Comdr. Howard C. Plummer, USNR, in command.  World War II North Atlantic operations  The oiler departed Baltimore on 27 August for shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay. She completed this cruise‚Äîinterrupted by an availability at the Norfolk Navy Yard between 4 and 15 September‚Äîlate in that month and put to sea from Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 September, bound for the West Indies. Operating from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the ship spent the next 10 weeks carrying fuel oil between ports on the Gulf Coast of the United States and bases in the West Indies. She also conducted underway refueling exercises before returning to Norfolk on 10 December and remaining there for the rest of the year.  Post- war Atlantic operations  At the beginning of 1946, the ship was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service and began regular voyages carrying oil from gulf coast and West Indian oil ports to cities along the east coast. By August 1947, she expanded her itinerary to include Persian Gulf oil ports, making two round-trip voyages between the United States and the island of Bahrain during the period August 1947 to April 1948. During the summer of 1948, Allagash began deployments with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Returning to the east coast of the United States in September 1948, she resumed runs between the Atlantic seaboard and oil ports in the West Indies and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  Participation in 1952 NATO exercises  Allagash did not deploy to the Mediterranean again until 1951 when she operated with the 6th Fleet between June and September. Her next overseas deployment came in the summer of 1952 when she sailed to northern European ports during a training cruise for midshipmen. That fall, the oiler participated in the NATO exercise \\"Operation Mainbrace.\\" In the spring of 1953, the ship was once more deployed to the Mediterranean. Operations along the eastern seaboard occupied her time during the latter part of 1953 and the first five months of 1954. Early in June 1954, Allagash sailed for Europe again on the first of two midshipmen training cruises conducted that summer. Repairs and western Atlantic missions took up the remainder of that year.  1955 West Indies exercises  In mid-January 1955, she completed a three-month overhaul and embarked upon three weeks of refresher training in the West Indies. During the latter part of February and the first week in March, the oiler took part in the annual \\"Springboard\\" exercise in the West Indies. She embarked upon another cruise to the Mediterranean early in May and returned to the United States at the beginning of October. Emergency repairs kept her out of operation in November and December. In the 10 years between the beginning of 1956 and the beginning of 1966, Allagash continued to conduct operations along the lines established during her first decade of service. She made six deployments to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, participated in NATO exercises, and made midshipmen cruises. When not deployed overseas, the oiler conducted east coast and West Indian missions, including the annual \\"Springboard\\" fleet exercise as well as type training, refresher training, and independent ship exercises.  Supporting the fleet during the Cuban crisis  During November and December 1962, she earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for providing logistics support to the warships enforcing President John F. Kennedy's \\"quarantine\\" of Cuba to compel the Soviet Union to remove offensive missiles from that island.  1966 South Atlantic tour  The year 1966, the first of her last five of active service, began as had many of the previous 20. She had returned from a Mediterranean deployment late in 1965. February 1966 brought the usual \\"Springboard\\" exercises in the West Indies followed by several weeks of operations out of Newport, Rhode Island. On 21 June, Allagash departed Newport on a voyage that added a new area of the world to her itinerary, the South Atlantic. During that cruise, she visited Port Elizabeth in South Africa and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, before returning to Newport on 18 August. After a period of post-deployment standdown and local operations, the oiler began regular overhaul at Boston on 17 November.  1968 Springboard operations  She completed repairs on 30 April 1967 and resumed operations out of Newport, Rhode Island. On 10 August, the ship was again deployed to the Mediterranean. Allagash returned to Newport on 4 February 1968 and, after standdown, participated in the annual \\"Springboard\\" exercises and conducted local operations from her base at Newport. Between 22 April and 14 June, she took part in exercises in the northern Atlantic during which she also visited northern European ports. She returned to the Rhode Island coast on 14 June visiting Melville, Rhode Island, and Newport until 19 July. During the remainder of the year, Allagash completed missions off the coasts of Florida and New England. On 6 January 1969, the oiler departed Newport on her final assignment with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and returned to Newport on 27 July. She spent her final year of service operating off the east coast of the United States.  Inactivation and decommissioning  Allagash was placed in commission, in reserve, at Boston, Massachusetts, on 2 September 1970 to prepare for inactivation. On 21 December 1970, she was decommissioned. Though she remained Navy property, Allagash was turned over to the custody of the Maritime Administration on 13 November 1971 at its James River, Virginia, facility. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1973, and she was sold to the Union Minerals & Alloys Corp. on 22 March 1976 for scrapping. Her ship's bell has been preserved as the church bell of St. Michael the Archangel Orthodox Church in Wilmington, Delaware.

Traveling north-south through Eastern North Carolina, it connects the various rural towns and communities with the cities of Jacksonville (via U.S. Route 258 (US 258) and NC 24), Goldsboro and Tarboro. Route descriptionHistory NC 111 was established in 1930 as a new primary routing between NC 11, in Kornegay, and US 70/NC 10, in Goldsboro; the highway was mostly graded dirt, serving the Drummersville community. By 1935, NC 111 was extended through Goldsboro to Cherry Hospital, replacing NC 402. Also in 1935, NC 111 was realigned in Wayne County and was extended south on new primary routing to NC 24, west of Beulaville. In 1940, NC 111 was rerouted at Albertson. NC 111 along Catherine Lake Road Between 1939-44, NC 111 was rerouted in Goldsboro, to accommodate the United States Army Air Corps Technical Training School (later becoming Seymour Johnson Air Force Base), it was moved from Slocumb Street to Piedmont Road. By 1948, NC 111 was rerouted southeast of NC 11 to Beulaville, ending at NC 24/NC 41; its old alignment along Williams Road was downgraded to secondary road (SR 1701). By 1949, NC 111 was truncated at US 70A/US 117A/NC 581 in Goldsboro; its routing to Cherry Hospital was replaced by NC 581. In 1959, NC 111 was rerouted for Seymour Johnson Air Force Base again, to its current approach to US 70; its old alignment became secondary roads Old 111 Highway (SR 1710) and Piedmont Airline Road (SR 1755). In August 1984, NC 111 was extended, along with NC 41, south to Chinquapin, where it split-off and continued west to its current southern terminus at US 258/NC 24, in Catherine Lake. This routing was initially established as a new primary routing for NC 144 a month prior, but was subsequently replaced before any actual signage was made. On January 1, 1985, NC 111 was rerouted onto new northern bypass routing of Goldsboro, along with US 70; it then was extended as a new primary routing north to NC 222, near Eureka. The former Goldsboro downtown alignment was replaced with US 70 Business. In May 1994, NC 111 was extended north along NC 222 to north of Saratoga, where it continues along new primary routing to Tarboro. In Tarboro, it took Wilson Street to Main Street south, crossing the Tar River, into Princeville and then overlapping briefly with US 258 before continuing east along Greenwood Boulevard. At Fountain Fork, NC 111 turns northeast and ends at its current northern terminus at NC 11/NC 44, in Oak City. In July, NC 111, and other primary routes, were rerouted out of Tarboro and onto US 64/US 258 over the Tar River to Princeville. North Carolina Highway 402 North Carolina Highway 402 (NC 402) was established as a new primary spur highway from US 1/US 17/NC 40 in Goldsboro to Cherry Hospital, a state operated psychiatric hospital, via Ash Street.

He was knighted at Hatton House on 8 November 1617. He was a board member of the Somers Isles Company, and in 1619 bought shares in the Virginia Company. In November 1620, he was listed as one of the shareholders of the Plymouth Council for New England, a group that would open up colonization of New England. In 1621 he was elected MP for East Retford and sat on a royal commission in Ireland in 1622.A. Brown, The Genesis of the United States, 2 Vols (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston & New York/Riverside Press, Cambridge 1891), II, pp. 979-80. Rich became a prominent member of the Virginia Company, and when, in April 1623, there occurred the great split between two factions in the company, he took a leading part on the side of his cousin, Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick.The Genesis of the United States, II, pp. 980-82.S.M. Kingsbury, The Records of the Virginia Company of London 4 Vols. Library of Congress.Vol. 4. (U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington 1935) In 1624 he was elected MP for East Retford and for Harwich and chose to sit for Harwich. He was specially attacked by the opposing faction of the Virginia Company when the dispute came before the House of Commons in May 1624, but he sat on the Virginia commission of July 1624. Rich was re-elected MP for Harwich in 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In 1629, with the Earl of Warwick and others, he found the funds for the first voyage of discovery to Providence Island, off the north-east of Yucatan. On 4 December 1630 they received the patent forming the governor and company of adventurers for the plantation of Providence and Henrietta. To this Providence Island Company Rich seems henceforth to have devoted his best efforts. Many matters of importance, especially regulations and affairs requiring legal handling, were left to him. When fresh funds were required he was always the first to respond. He appears to have pursued a forward policy, for in 1635 he advocated the admission of all the adventurers to the benefits of the trade of the main. A little later, on his motion, the first local council of Providence was appointed. On 7 May 1635 he was appointed deputy governor of the company, and held the post for about a year.  Death  Rich died before 26 May 1636. It was rumoured to Mathew Cradock that overdoses from an antimonial cup from Massachusetts hastened his end.Letter of Mathew Cradock to John Winthrop, 15 March 1636/37, Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Series IV Vol. 6 (The Society, Boston 1863), pp. 125 ff.

Content and style On the album Collins' voice and guitar are sparsely accompanied by Fred Hellerman and Walter Raim on second guitar, Erik Darling on banjo and Bill Lee on bass. The title song is a variant of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\". The selections range from the Scottish anthem \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\" to the Irish standards \\"Bold Fenian Men\\" and \\"The Prickilie Bush\\". The album also includes more obscure numbers such as \\"Tim Evans\\", \\"Wars of Germany\\" and \\"John Riley\\".

In habitats in which trees are present, animals have evolved to move in them. Some animals may scale trees only occasionally, but others are exclusively arboreal. The habitats pose numerous mechanical challenges to animals moving through them and lead to a variety of anatomical, behavioral and ecological consequences as well as variations throughout different species.Cartmill, M. (1985). Climbing. In Functional Vertebrate Morphology, eds. M. Hildebrand D. M. Bramble K. F. Liem and D. B. Wake, pp. 73‚Äì88. Cambridge: Belknap Press. Furthermore, many of these same principles may be applied to climbing without trees, such as on rock piles or mountains. The earliest known tetrapod with specializations that adapted it for climbing trees was Suminia, a synapsid of the Late Permian, about 260 million years ago. Some animals are exclusively arboreal in habitat, such as the tree snail. Biomechanics Arboreal habitats pose numerous mechanical challenges to animals moving in them, which have been solved in diverse ways. These challenges include moving on narrow branches, moving up and down inclines, balancing, crossing gaps, and dealing with obstructions. Diameter Moving along a narrow surface poses special difficulties to animals. During locomotion on the ground, the location of the center of mass may swing from side to side, but during arboreal locomotion, this would result in the center of mass moving beyond the edge of the branch, resulting in a tendency to topple over. Additionally, foot placement is constrained by the need to make contact with the narrow branch. This narrowness severely restricts the range of movements and postures an animal can use to move. Incline Branches are frequently oriented at an angle to gravity in arboreal habitats, including being vertical, which poses special problems. As an animal moves up an inclined branch, they must fight the force of gravity to raise their body, making the movement more difficult. Conversely, as the animal descends, it must also fight gravity to control its descent and prevent falling. Descent can be particularly problematic for many animals, and highly arboreal species often have specialized methods for controlling their descent. Balance Gibbons are very good brachiators because their elongated arms enable them to easily swing and grasp on to branches Due to the height of many branches and the potentially disastrous consequences of a fall, balance is of primary importance to arboreal animals. On horizontal and gently sloped branches, the primary problem is tipping to the side due to the narrow base of support. The narrower the branch, the greater the difficulty in balancing a given animal faces. On steep and vertical branches, tipping becomes less of an issue, and pitching backwards or slipping downwards becomes the most likely failure. In this case, large-diameter branches pose a greater challenge since the animal cannot place its forelimbs closer to the center of the branch than its hindlimbs. Crossing gaps Branches are not continuous, and any arboreal animal must be able to move between gaps in the branches, or even between trees. This can be accomplished by reaching across gaps, by leaping across them or gliding between them. Obstructions Arboreal habitats often contain many obstructions, both in the form of branches emerging from the one being moved on and other branches impinging on the space the animal needs to move through. These obstructions may impede locomotion, or may be used as additional contact points to enhance it. While obstructions tend to impede limbed animals, they benefit snakes by providing anchor points. Anatomical specializations Arboreal organisms display many specializations for dealing with the mechanical challenges of moving through their habitats. Limb length Arboreal animals frequently have elongated limbs that help them cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead, and in some cases, to brachiate. However, some species of lizard have reduced limb size that helps them avoid limb movement being obstructed by impinging branches. Prehensile tails Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, green tree pythons, emerald tree boas, chameleons, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey and crested gecko, the tip of the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provide increased friction. Claws The silky anteater uses its prehensile tail as a third arm for stabilization and balance, while its claws help better grasp and climb onto branches Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and re-orient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large as to be essentially flat, from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Adhesion Adhesion is an alternative to claws, which works best on smooth surfaces. Wet adhesion is common in tree frogs and arboreal salamanders, and functions either by suction or by capillary adhesion. Dry adhesion is best typified by the specialized toes of geckos, which use van der Waals forces to adhere to many substrates, even glass. Gripping Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates a frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. Animals other than primates that use gripping in climbing include the chameleon, which has mitten-like grasping feet, and many birds that grip branches in perching or moving about. Reversible feet To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Low center of mass Many arboreal species lower their center of mass to reduce pitching and toppling movement when climbing. This may be accomplished by postural changes, altered body proportions, or smaller size. Small size Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches), and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the reduced weight per snout-vent length for 'flying' frogs. Hanging under perches The gecko's toes adhere to surfaces via dry adhesion, to allow them to stay firmly attached to a branch or even a flat wall Some species of primate, bat, and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip. Behavioral specializations Arboreal species have behaviors specialized for moving in their habitats, most prominently in terms of posture and gait. Specifically, arboreal mammals take longer steps, extend their limbs further forwards and backwards during a step, adopt a more 'crouched' posture to lower their center of mass, and use a diagonal sequence gait. Ecological consequences Arboreal locomotion allows animals access to different resources, depending upon their abilities. Larger species may be restricted to larger-diameter branches that can support their weight, while smaller species may avoid competition by moving in the narrower branches. Climbing without trees Lions on a rock at Serengeti National Park, Tanzania Many animals climb in other habitats, such as in rock piles or mountains, and in those habitats, many of the same principles apply due to inclines, narrow ledges, and balance issues. However, less research has been conducted on the specific demands of locomotion in these habitats. Perhaps the most exceptional of the animals that move on steep or even near vertical rock faces by careful balancing and leaping are the various types of mountain dwelling caprid such as the Barbary sheep, markhor, yak, ibex, tahr, rocky mountain goat, and chamois. Their adaptations may include a soft rubbery pad between their hooves for grip, hooves with sharp keratin rims for lodging in small footholds, and prominent dew claws. The snow leopard, being a predator of such mountain caprids, also has spectacular balance and leaping abilities; being able to leap up to ‚âà17m (~50 ft). Other balancers and leapers include the mountain zebra, mountain tapir, and hyraxes. Brachiation Brachiation is a specialized form of arboreal locomotion, used by primates to move very rapidly while hanging beneath branches. Arguably the epitome of arboreal locomotion, it involves swinging with the arms from one handhold to another. Only a few species are brachiators, and all of these are primates; it is a major means of locomotion among spider monkeys and gibbons, and is occasionally used by the female orangutans. Gibbons are the experts of this mode of locomotion, swinging from branch to branch distances of up to 15 m (50 ft), and traveling at speeds of as much as . Gliding and parachuting To bridge gaps between trees, many animals such as the flying squirrel have adapted membranes, such as patagia for gliding flight. Some animals can slow their descent in the air using a method known as parachuting, such as Rhacophorus (a \\"flying frog\\" species) that has adapted toe membranes allowing it to fall more slowly after leaping from trees. Limbless climbing Many species of snake are highly arboreal, and some have evolved specialized musculature for this habitat. While moving in arboreal habitats, snakes move slowly along bare branches using a specialized form of concertina locomotion,Astley, H. C. and Jayne, B. C. (2007). Effects of perch diameter and incline on the kinematics, performance, and modes of arboreal locomotion of corn snakes (Elaphe guttata)\\" J. Exp. Biol. 210, 3862-3872. but when secondary branches emerge from the branch being moved on, snakes use lateral undulation, a much faster mode. As a result, snakes perform best on small perches in cluttered environments, while limbed organisms seem to do best on large perches in uncluttered environments. Arboreal animals Arboreal snails use their sticky slime to help in climbing up trees since they lack limbs to do so Many species of animals are arboreal, far too many to list individually. This list is of prominently or predominantly arboreal species and higher taxa. See also * Suspensory behavior * ReferencesSources * * Cartmill, M. (1974). Pads and claws in arboreal locomotion.

He then went to southern California to earn enough money to pay off his debts and be in a position to marry Margaret. He served as organist at Grauman's Metropolitan Theatre. The following June he returned to Salt Lake City and he and Margaret married, after which they returned to southern California. During this time period Schreiner also worked as an organist at the Barker Brother's Department Store.Berghout. Alexander Schreiner. p. 41-47. In August 1928, Schreiner once again returned to Salt Lake City, where he resumed his position as Tabernacle Organist and also served as the chief organist at the Capitol Theatre.Berghout.

Alexander Schreiner. p. 53 He was appointed chief organist of the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. Schreiner returned to Salt Lake and the Tabernacle in the summer of 1930, but in September 1930 he began a term as the organist of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA).Berghout. Alexander Schreiner. p. 58 Through 1939 Schreiner retained this position at UCLA and would return to the Tabernacle for summers. During this time, he also was a member of the LDS Church's Music Committee.Berghout. Alexander Schreiner. p. 62-68 Schreiner was also director of music for the Jewish Wilshire Boulevard Temple during this time. By 1930 Schreiner's reputation as an organist was great enough he was recruited on occasion to inaugurate new organs. Despite his major commitments to music Schreiner also served in the LDS Church in other ways. He was a member of the high council of the church's Hollywood Stake. Some of his children followed him into music, one beginning to serve as a Sunday School organist at age seven. In September 1936, Schreiner was made the stake music director of the Hollywood Stake.Berghout. Alexander Schreiner. p. 71 Return to Salt Lake In the summer of 1937, Schreiner took up the position of organist at the LDS chapel in Washington DC which had been vacant since the death the previous March of his one time fellow Salt Lake Tabernacle Organist, Edward P.

Schreiner had already signed another one-year contract with UCLA, but that would be his last year with that institution.Berghout. Alexander Schreiner. p. 72 From that time until 1977, Schreiner was closely involved with the Tabernacle Choir both at home and abroad.

In the style of the Evel Knievel craze of the mid 1970s, the game allows the player to perform simulated motorcycle jumping stunts. The arcade cabinet is modeled like a real motorcycle handlebar, and the player twists the right side for acceleration. The monitor is a 19-inch black and white cathode-ray tube with a black and white overlay. Gameplay The screen is divided into three horizontal platforms connected by tubes on the monitor overlay. The player can only accelerate and brake, with no steering. The motorcycle automatically drives across each platform in sequence: left to right, right to left, then left to right again. The bottom platform has a line of parked buses between two ramps, and the goal is to repeatedly jump the buses and land safely. Upon starting, the player must jump over 8 buses. If successful, another bus is added and at 23 buses, one additional credit is added. Otherwise, crashing thrice or jumping over 27 buses ends game. Accelerating too quickly results in a wheelie and, if speed is not decreased, flipping over backward and crashing. Speed carries over from one platform to the next. On the third platform, the cycle must reach the landing ramp to avoid a crash. Home versions Atari's Stunt Cycle console Two dedicated console versions were released by Atari in 1977. Atari's own branded Stunt Cycle version plays four games: a version of the original and three variants (Motocross, Enduro, and DragRace) based on the AY-3-8760 chip by General Instrument. Handlebar grips on the unit allow players to whip, wheelie, and jump up to 32 onscreen buses. The unit provides digital on-screen scoring and color graphics. The Sears Tele-Games version called Motocross Sports Center IV includes the same Stunt Cycle variants and 16 Pong games played with detachable Pong controllers (based on Atari C010765 chip for the Pong games and the GI chip AY-3-8760). In 1980, Atari programmer Bob Polaro began to develop a Stunt Cycle port for the Atari 2600 using full color graphics. By the time it was completed, Atari had decided to turn it into a television tie-in game for the Dukes of Hazzard franchise instead. This game never progressed beyond the prototype stage and was not officially released. Bob Polaro independently released 50 copies of Stunt Cycle in 2003.

Across from each quarter pipe is an equal sized roll-in ramp for speed. The park also includes a pyramid with an attached four-stair and rail, and a smaller 3¬Ω ft. spine. The park is not entirely in favor of ramps. There is a descending square rail in the corner, away from the ramps, and easily accessible. Also on the opposite side there is a box, and a box attached to each other, for grinding and manual tricks. The park is very easy to get around although some skateboarders complain that metal ramps affect performance. Other than loud noise, the only down-side is the heat emanating from the ramps in hot weather. The city is very serious about the skatepark. Some call it \\"Raytown's test park\\" because if it works with and for the youth then a second, better skatepark may be built in the near future.

She saw action primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. After the war she was sold to India and converted into a pilot vessel. Kokanee was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942‚Äì43 building program. Named after Kokanee Lake in southeastern British Columbia, she was laid down on 25 August 1943 at Yarrows Ltd., Esquimalt and launched on 27 November 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN with pennant number K419 on 6 June 1944 at the Esquimalt naval base. She departed for the Atlantic coast, arriving at HMC Dockyard in Halifax, Nova Scotia on 24 July 1944 and was tasked to Bermuda in August 1944 to work up her new crew. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history Upon finishing her training, Kokanee joined the RCN's Atlantic Fleet and returned to northern waters, arriving in St. John's in September where she was assigned to Escort Group C-3 as the Senior Officer's Ship. Kokanee and EG C-3 spent the remainder of the Battle of the Atlantic on convoy escort duty. She also earned battle honours in the Battle of the St. Lawrence between September‚ÄìNovember 1944 when she escorted convoys from Quebec City to the Cabot Strait and Strait of Belle Isle. Kokanee spent the winter of 1944‚Äì1945 on the North Atlantic, escorting her final convoy ON.304 west from Derry, Northern Ireland on 25 May 1945. She departed Halifax for Esquimalt in June 1945 and commenced refit there for tropicalization as part of Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan. The Surrender of Japan took place in August while Kokanee was still in refit, which she completed on 4 October 1945. The peacetime downsizing of the RCN saw her paid off on 21 December 1945 and was placed in reserve status. Civilian service Kokanee was sold to a Canadian shipbroker in 1947 and resold to the Government of India in 1948. She was converted to a pilot vessel for the Hooghly River and renamed Bengal in 1950. The ship was renamed P.V. Bengal in 1956 and was broken up in India in 1965.

California is a set of United States Supreme Court cases, all dealing with disputes over water distribution from the Colorado River between the states of Arizona and California. It also covers the amount of water that the State of Nevada receives from the river as well. When a dispute arises between two states, the case is filed for original jurisdiction with the United States Supreme Court. This is one of the very limited circumstances where the Court has original jurisdiction; that is, as a trial court and no lower may hear the case. In all other cases, the Court acts as the highest level appellate court in the United States. The cases involved were all named Arizona v. California, and were decided in 1931, 1934, 1936, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1979, 1983, 1984, and 2000. The original decision, , specified the amount of water to which Arizona was entitled under the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Since then, the case has been relitigated several times because of Arizona's claims of California using more water than it is entitled. * : Arizona argued that the Colorado River Compact was unconstitutional. * : Arizona requested that the Supreme Court: **specify an amount of Colorado River water for Arizona's use **limit the amount allotted to California * : The court specified the amount of water to which each state in the Colorado River Compact was entitled. * : The court adjusted the amounts of water specified in 373 US 546. * : The court adjusted its previous decree. * : The court adjusted the specified amounts of water for all parties to the case. * : The court issued a decree regarding unadjudicated rights of Indian tribes to Colorado River water. * : The court adjusted its previous decree. * : The court adjusted the specified amounts of water for several parties to the case. In summary, as long as at least of water is available from the Colorado River, California is allocated ; Nevada, ; and Arizona, the remainder. If more water is available, California is entitled to 50% of the water from the Colorado River, Arizona to 46%, and Nevada to 4%. If less water is available, the Secretary of the Interior must allocate the water according to various formulas (which were the subjects of the court cases) to ensure that each state receives a specified amount, with California receiving an absolute fixed maximum of per year (376 U.S. 342).\\"(3) In insufficient mainstream water is available for release, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, to satisfy annual consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre-feet in the aforesaid three States, then the Secretary of the Interior... may apportion the amount remaining available... but in no event shall more than 4,400,000 acre-feet be apportioned for use in California...\\" 376 U.S. 440, 442 Some of the adjustments involved rights of the U.S. Government with respect to supplying water to Indian tribes pursuant to Executive Orders signed by the President of the United States as far back as 1907.

Of Quaker origin, Cummin attended Friends Seminary (his mother, wife and both daughters were all educated there). On course at a young age for his eventual career, Melville Cummin is listed in Mary Mapes Dodge's St. Nicholas Magazine in 1909 as President of a seven-member chapter of the St. Nicholas League called \\"St. Nick Drawing Club\\".St. Nicholas by Mary Mapes Dodge.

He held no college degrees. He was a teetotaler. Cummin married at around age twenty. He became a father at age twenty-one in 1916. Graphic artist Cummin worked as a graphic artist for many decades. At various times he was a staff artist for publications of the Boy Scouts of America (c. 1912, shortly after the organization's founding) and West Point. He served as art director for the American Kennel Club \\"Gazette\\". The editors of the \\"Gazette\\" paid tribute to Cummin in 2005 by revisiting his work, and called him \\"the master draftsman whose cartoons were such a distinctive part of the GAZETTE during the 1940s and '50s.\\" In fact, Cummin drew for that publication at least as early as 1937. Cummin drew editorial cartoons for The Middletown News-Signal, an Ohio daily. He worked as an illustrator for the San Francisco Examiner as well as a number of New York newspapers, and also contributed to magazines, including the original Life. When the renowned Winsor McCay left the employ of the New York Sunday American in 1924, the great newspaper journalist Arthur Brisbane hired Cummin to fill the vacancy, because of a similarity of style. Brisbane told Cummin however that the job would be McCay's again if he desired to reclaim it. McCay did so in 1927. After McCay's death in 1934 Brisbane rehired Cummin (Brisbane died December 25, 1936). Therefore, Cummin originated and drew many of the big, eight-column cartoons for Brisbane's editorials in the New York Sunday American, the New York Evening Journal and occasionally The Mirror from 1924 to 1927, and again in 1934 and 1935. Cummin called Brisbane \\"a well-informed naturalist,\\" and said the two collaborators discussed the subject of Naturalism frequently.Back to Nature, the New Daily Feature for Newspapers that was Created on Popular Demand by Mel Cummin, Copyright, 1937, by Mel Cummin (a self-published prospectus for newspaper staffs), p.5 Mel Cummin's paper doll pages for McCall's in 1922.

Cummin rounded out his credentials with memberships in the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, New York Zoological Society, and National Geographic Society. His willingness to take a public stand in favor of science and the theory of evolution is demonstrated by his involvement with a publication called Evolution: A Journal of Nature. The magazine was published between 1927 and 1938. Its twelfth and final issue notes the addition to the group of Contributing Editors of \\"Melville P.

It is illegal to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian Tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization, resident within the United States. For a first time violation of the Act, an individual can face civil or criminal penalties up to a $250,000 fine or a five-year prison term, or both. If business violates the Act, it can face civil penalties or can be prosecuted and fined up to $1,000,000. The law covers all Indian and Indian-style traditional and contemporary arts and crafts produced after 1935. The Act broadly applies to the marketing of arts and crafts by any person in the United States. Some traditional items frequently copied by non-Indians include Indian-style jewelry, pottery, baskets, carved stone fetishes, woven rugs, kachina figures, and clothing. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board, an agency established in 1934, has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Act. Definitions The US Department of the Interior explicitly states on its informational website about the Act that, \\"Under the Act, an Indian is defined as a member of any federally or State recognized Indian Tribe, or an individual certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian Tribe.\\"\\"The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990.\\" US Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board.

It is illegal to market an art or craft item using the name of a tribe if a member, or certified Indian artisan, of that tribe did not actually create the art or craft item. Section 309.4 of the act also allows for individuals with tribal ancestry who are not eligible for enrollment to be designated as \\"an Indian artisan by a particular tribe\\". The certification must be documented in writing by the tribal government.\\"Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 Public Law 101-644.\\" Native American Artists. 21 Oct 1996. Accessed 18 May 2014.

In Kongo documents written in Portuguese, or in older Portuguese accounts of Kongo it often is translated by \\"gera√ß√£o\\" (family or lineage in Portuguese). Historical usage In older times, before about 1850, the term probably referred to elite lineages or descent groups (and their clients and slaves) who ruled the country. In modern Kikongo usage, for example in clan histories, or publications such as Nkutama a mvila za makanda (Tumba 1934, 4th edition, Matadi, 1972), it refers to a matrilineal descent group. In this literature, the kanda is often associated with a mvila or clan motto, which is in the form of a boast or other statement of identity, as well as a kinkulu, a history of the clan's migrations. Ruling kandas of Kongo Throughout its history the royal family has had branching factions that often fought each other over succession to the kingdom. Although these branches were probably called kanda, they were not strictly speaking descent groups, since they sometimes formed around two brothers. In the sixteenth century and later, the kingdom's kandas were referred to as houses, thus the Nlaza or Kinlaza kanda was also known as the House of Kinlaza. The ruling kandas were fairly short lived and unstable before the late seventeenth century, though there were houses noted, such as the Nsaku, who ruled Mbata, or the Houses of Kwilu and Nsundi (both geographical rather than kin group names). In the early to mid-seventeenth century, however, the ruling kandas gradually hardened into permanent divisions. Three were recognized by tradition of the early eighteenth century, these being the Kinlaza, Kimpanzu and Kikanga a Mvika. While the Kikanga a Mvika was destroyed when its members sought to overthrow Garcia II (of the Kinlaza) in 1656‚Äì57, the other two became permanent contestants over the throne, being constantly named in documents throughout the eighteenth centuries. In a few places the identification with these kandas continued in tradition into the twentieth century, but for the most part in the nineteenth century they splintered into many more groups. Other potential kandas (though the term was not used for them) include some families who bore Portuguese surnames and passed their names on patrilinearly. For example, the da Silvas, de Castros and combinations of these two ruled in Mbamba and then in Soyo from the early seventeenth century, while the Agua Rosadas emerged in the late seventeenth century from descendants of the Kimpanzu and Kinlasa (Pedro IV and his brothers were the first representatives of this kanda). Eighteenth century sources indicated that de Le√£o, a kin group founded by Queen Ana Afonso de Le√£o and her nephews continued as a permanent group as did later emerging groups such as Romano Leite. It is unclear how these named groups worked in the system of kinship and descent defined by kandas, which were, it seems larger and more flexible.

It was discovered by the HATNet Project via the transit method and confirmed with Doppler spectroscopy, so both its mass and radius are known quite precisely; based on these figures it is predicted that the planet has about 75 Earth masses worth of heavy elements in its core, making it similar to the planet HD 149026b. The planet HAT-P-3b is named Teberda. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Russia, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Teberda is a mountain river in Dombay region (name of HAT-P-3). In 2013, this planet was photometrically observed by Spitzer space telescope which characterized its near-zero eccentricity and low albedo. Discovery In 2007 the HATNet Project reported the discovery of HAT-P-3b transiting the metal-rich early K dwarf star HAT-P-3 with an orbital period of 2.9 days. It was found with the 11 cm aperture HAT-5 telescope, located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins in Arizona. Follow up radial velocity observations to confirm the planet were made with the 1.5 m Tillinghast reflector in order to rule out the possibility that the observed decrease in brightness was caused by an eclipsing binary. Final confirmation was made at the W. M. Keck Observatory using the HIRES spectrograph to measure the mass and orbital parameters of the planet.

The club competed in the first Italian Football Championship, and stayed in the competition until the club dissolved in 1906. Italian Football Championship The club was the fourth oldest club in the history of Turin football, founded in 1894 the club wore similar colours to their local rivals Internazionale Torino with amber and black striped shirts with black socks, Internazionale wore white shorts, while Torinese wore black however. The club was one of four that took part in the first ever Italian Football Championship during 1898. Torinese were narrowly knocked out, 2‚Äì1 by Internazionale in the semi-finals. They had similar results in the second season, losing out early in the competition to Ginnastica Torino (another Torinese club). In 1900, a merger took place where Internazionale Torino joined with Torinese; they kept they Torinese name. This proved to be a sensible move as that season it saw the club reaching the final of the Italian Championship for the first time; on the way they knocked out Juventus and Milan, the latter of which was achieved with an Edoardo Bosio hat-trick. The final took place against Genoa, after full-time it was 1‚Äì1, but the Genovese scored two goals in extra time to seal the title. After a season of absence the club returned to the growing league for 1902, they were involved in two high-scoring matches, the first of which was a 4‚Äì1 victory over Juventus, the second was a 4‚Äì3 loss in the semi-finals to eventual champions Genoa. Their final two seasons in the league were considerably less successful as they were put out by Juventus both times. Becoming defunct In 1906, some members of the Juventus (fellow Turin club) board were considering moving the bianconeri out of Turin. This caused a large argument within the club. The president Alfredo Dick left with several high-key players to form Football Club Torino. Many players from Torinese were lured to sign for the new FBC Torino and with a shortage of top players, Torinese became defunct.

The primary business location is at 4882 N. Clark Street, in the Uptown community area of Chicago in Cook County, with a second location at 4601 W. Armitage Avenue. The company was founded by Ross Cascio, who sold the company on January 20, 1981. The firm became controversial in the late 1960s and 1970s, with Chicago Daily News columnist Mike Royko publishing several articles on Cascio's alleged strong-arm tactics, Aldermanic candidate Dick Simpson making the firm a campaign issue, and folk singer Steve Goodman writing a song about the firm, calling them the \\"Lincoln Park Pirates.\\" The company describes itself as relocators who protect property owners from illegal parkers on parking lots with contracts for the company's services. Its business is parking enforcement, and the company does not provide roadside assistance. The company, its relocators and its dispatchers are regulated and licensed by the Illinois Commerce Commission. On September 12, 2018, the ICC revoked Lincoln Towing's Illinois relocation towing license. However, a Cook County judge subsequently overruled the ICC's decision, reinstating Lincoln Towing's license. Business Lincoln provides relocation services for landlords with tenant parking problems and for commercial property owners with similar problems. The primary business is removing vehicles from parking spaces. The business claims the largest fleet of wheel-lift and flatbed towing vehicles in Chicago. The business model is such that towing companies engage in exclusive towing contracts for properties and collect fees from owners of unauthorized vehicles that have been towed. However, the company also provides vehicle repossession services and parking lot management services which include snow removal, pot hole patching, striping, and complete parking lot construction. As a private company enforcing private property parking, the company does not issue parking tickets in addition to charging for towing and storage, unlike the City of Chicago, which does for parking in tow zones. It has towed over 30,000 parked cars since September 5, 2005, which makes it Chicago's leading relocator. Towing is a business regulated by the Illinois Commerce Commission and specifically by the Illinois Commercial Relocation of Trespassing Vehicles Law. These laws are found under Chapter 625 of the Illinois Consolidated Statutes at Title 5/Chapter 18A and Chapter 92 of the Illinois Administrative Code: Part 1710. This law regulates the activities of companies that tow unauthorized vehicles from private property in Cook, Will, Kane, DuPage, and Winnebago counties. This law does not affect the towing of cars parked on public streets, companies who provide roadside assistance‚Äìrelated towing, companies involved in repossession, or vehicles towed at the direction of local enforcement authorities. Controversies=1960's & 70's Sign showing prices before June 13, 2007 state authorized price increases Starting in 1967, Chicago Daily News columnist Mike Royko wrote a series of articles about Cascio that continued for over a decade. Royko claimed that \\"to intimidate those who objected, Cascio hung bats, blackjacks, chains and other pacifiers on his office wall. If a person tried to escape with his own car, Cascio's men would dance on his chest.\\" Cascio sued Royko twice, but lost both suits. As early as 1968, complaints were lodged against Lincoln Towing Service claiming that the company was towing cars without legal standing and threatening people who tried to reclaim automobiles without paying. In 1971, the company became an issue during the 44th Ward aldermanic race. James Kargman, one of the candidates, called for a campaign to \\"hit Cascio in the pocketbook‚Äîwhere it hurts.\\" Kargman worked to encourage several local businesses to cancel contracts with Lincoln Towing Service. In an interview, Cascio commented, \\"Most of these firms that canceled have informed me they'd be back after the aldermanic elections are over and the heat is off.\\" Shortly after the aldermanic race, a mob of 300 people attacked a Lincoln Towing employee who was removing a car from a parking lot. The Chicago City Council debated taking actions against the firm. In 1972, Chicago folk singer Steve Goodman wrote the song \\"Lincoln Park Pirates\\" about Lincoln Towing Service. Although he originally only performed the song in Chicago, he was eventually convinced that the sentiments of the song were recognizable outside Chicago. Although initially Chicago stations would not play the song with Ross Cascio's name in it for fear of lawsuits, eventually it became known that Cascio was proud of the song and airplay followed. 1990's & 2000's In 1992, the firm, then headed by Steve Mash, was charged with possession of stolen vehicles after detectives witnessed the company's employees tow a car and the next day witnessed employees strip the car and transfer the materials to a scrap metal recycling company. The company and Mash were acquitted of the charges. According to Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) Police Commander Craig Baner, Lincoln Towing Service had 2078 complaints from 2000-2005. However, with the volume of business the towing service conducts, the complaint rates are comparable with other towing companies in Illinois. During the same period, Lincoln Towing issued 139 full refunds, a percentage which Baner says the towing service compares with other companies. 2010's & 2020's In October 2015, following a concert at the Aragon Ballroom, Lincoln Towing towed cars belonging to concertgoers from an adjacent lot. Following the incident, a tow truck driver allegedly verbally harassed motorists who came to reclaim their vehicles and assaulted a cyclist. 47th Ward alderman Ameya Pawar reacted by proposing to shut down the company, stating \\"They‚Äôre bad actors; they‚Äôre just an outrageous operator and I‚Äôm looking at every option available in order to strike back.\\" On February 10, 2016, Aldermen Pawar and Reboyras introduced a City Council resolution citing \\"a pattern of illegal towing and abuse of customers by Lincoln Towing\\" and calling on company representatives to appear before the council. The following month, company attorney Allen Perl attended a City Council meeting and argued with Pawar. In June, the City Council passed the Chicago Towing Bill of Rights requiring, among other things, that towing operators notify the Chicago Police Department of where they have contracts to tow from, and that they install cameras in all tow trucks. On February 24, 2016, the ICC initiated an investigation into Lincoln Towing's continuing eligibility to hold an Illinois relocation towing license. On July 2, 2018, the ICC's Administrative Law Judge issued a ruling, which said commerce commission staff dramatically overstated Lincoln Towing violations. The judge concluded Lincoln Towing is fit, willing and able to continue towing cars. However, on September 12, 2018, the ICC revoked Lincoln Towing's Illinois relocation towing license. Thereafter, a Cook County judge ruled that Lincoln Towing Service could resume operating while it challenged a decision by state regulators to revoke its license. On June 12, 2019, the ICC announced that its decision was final, and would accept no further appeals. However, the Circuit Court case remained active, and Lincoln Towing was allowed to continue operations. On January 15, 2020, Circuit Court Judge Neil Cohen reinstated Lincoln Towing's ICC license, ruling that the ICC had improperly revoked it.

Landwehr-Division) was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as, during the period of German unification (1866-1871), the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. The division was formed on January 27, 1915, out of two formerly Mixed Landwehr Brigades (55th and the 57th). The division spent the period from its formation to early 1917 on the Western Front, mainly involved in positional warfare in Upper Alsace, after which it went to the Lorraine front. It was transferred to the Eastern Front in the Spring of 1917, where it remained after the 1917 armistice on that front. In 1918, it served on internal security missions in Ukraine, where it was located when World War I ended. Allied intelligence rated the division as a fourth class division.08.Landwehr-Division (Chronik 1915/1919)Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 153-155.

However, she had a lengthy career during the Cold War that followed. She was the only U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Caloosahatchee, after the Caloosahatchee River in southwest Florida. Caloosahatchee (AO-98) was launched 2 June 1945 by Bethlehem Steel-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc., Sparrows Point, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. C. L. Andrews; acquired by the Navy 10 October 1945; commissioned the same day, Commander H. R. Livingston, USNR, in command; and reported to Commander, Service Force, Atlantic Fleet.  Cold War operations  Caloosahatchee cruised off the U.S. East Coast, transporting oil and fueling ships at sea, and made a voyage to Iceland from Norfolk, Virginia, during her first two years of operations. On 14 August 1947, she sailed for her first tour of duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, a deployment that marked almost every year of her operations from that time into 1960. Caloosahatchee fueling Leyte and Samuel B. Roberts in 1948. In this era when the U.S. Navy had perfected at-sea replenishment to greatly increase mobility, flexibility and efficiency, Caloosahatchee played a key role in increasing the enormous power for peace represented by the mighty U.S. 6th Fleet. Among other widespread operations, Caloosahatchee participated in NATO Operation Mariner off Greenock, Scotland, from 16 September to 20 October 1953, and provided summer training for future naval officers in midshipman cruises to Le Havre, France, in 1954, and to Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1956. In fall 1957 and again in summer 1958, the oiler sailed with forces calling at ports in England, Scotland, France, and Portugal. Caloosahatchee's constant readiness for emergency deployments or other challenges to her operational capability was developed and maintained through training operations along the east coast, and participation in such large-scale Atlantic Fleet exercises as Operation Springboard held in the Caribbean, which operations continued through 1960.DANFS: Caloosahatchee Between 1966 and 1968 Caloosahatchee, along with her sister ships Ashtabula and Canisteo, underwent \\"jumboization\\". A 27 m (400-foot) midsection, built entirely new from the keel up, was inserted and welded between her original bow and stern. This replaced the old 310-foot midsection and increased the vessel's liquid cargo capacity by over one-third. Her new configuration closely resembled that of a more modern type of ship, the replenishment oiler. Caloosahatchee was recommissioned on 27 September 1969 and assigned to Service Squadron 2 (SERVRON 2), homeported in Newport, Rhode Island (USA). Caloosahatchee being undocked after her lengthening, 1968. During September 1970, Caloosahatchee participated in the naval blockade off the coast of Lebanon during the Black September in Jordan. The conflict was fought between the two major components of the Jordanian population, the Palestinians represented by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) under the leadership of Yasser Arafat and the native Jordanians represented by the Jordanian Armed Forces under the leadership of King Hussein.\\"Jordan: A Country Study\\" published by the Library of Congress In 1974 Caloosahatchee was transferred to the Bethlehem shipyard for a seven-month overhaul. While approaching dock facilities, the ship struck a dockside chock and bent the starboard shaft. The ship spent seven months effecting repairs to the starboard shaft. In addition, twin screws were transported by truck to replace the existing worn out screws. By February 1975, Caloosahatchee changed homeport to Norfolk, Virginia and was transferred to Service Squadron 4. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea via the North Atlantic, North Sea, and Baltic Sea. She again deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in 1977-1978, visiting Marseille, France and Palermo, Sicily. In 1975 Caloosahatchee was involved in a collision. to port, to starboard in Mediterranean. The ship suffered a gash to the port side along with the loss of the port anchor. A shoring party effected repairs. Caloosahatchee proceeded to Genoa, Italy to effect repairs to ensure seaworthiness. Due to Navy stand down orders, Caloosahatchee proceeded to Naples, Italy to finish repairs. The ship spent approximately one and one half months in Naples for repairs. Caloosahatchee was temporarily assigned to 2nd Fleet for operations off coast Norway eventually transiting the Arctic Circle. During the Mediterranean cruise, Caloosahatchee visited, Palma, Majorca, Rota, Spain, Brest, France, Liverpool, Loch Striven and Loch Ewe, United Kingdom and eventually Naples, Italy for approximately one and one half months. In 1978, Caloosahatchee underwent an eight-month major extended regular overhaul in Brooklyn, New York City. Following overhaul and after refresher training in August 1979, Caloosahatchee departed a month later with Commander United States Second Fleet for Northern Europe and NATO exercises to be conducted in the North Atlantic, North Sea, and the Baltic Sea where the oiler replenished 116 ships. In 1980, Caloosahatchee participated in various exercises, which involved two deployments to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and a five- month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. Over 170 replenishments were completed in 1980, a new record for the ship. In the following year, the oiler deployed to the Caribbean and for six months to the Mediterranean Sea. During 1988, Caloosahatchee made her last deployment to the Mediterranean Sea, where she recorded 191 underway replenishments. In 1989, she participated in exercise UNITAS XXX and crossed the equator.USS Caloosahatchee (AO-98), \\"SERVICE TO THE FLEET WITH PRIDE\\" OCTOBER 10, 1945 - FEBRUARY 28, 1990, retrieved 27 February 2015.

The harbor bridge crosses the Corpus Christi Ship Channel and handles nearly 26,000 vehicles daily. A new bridge called the New Harbor Bridge is currently under construction. When complete it will allow larger ships to pass beneath, permit safer pedestrian transit, and reconfigure the entire highway interchange system in the surrounding community. __TOC__ History Geography The entire bay ecosystem is protected from the Gulf Of Mexico by barrier islands. Mustang Island and San Jose Island are the two principal landmasses that shield the Aransas and Corpus Christi Bays from the wider Gulf Of Mexico. Inland from Corpus Christi Bay is Nueces Bay, the outlet for the Nueces River. The Nueces and Corpus Christi bays are separated by a sandbar anchored on the south end by Rincon Point peninsula and Indian Point peninsula on the north. Just south of Rincon Point was a small natural channel called Hall's Bayou. Hall's Bayou Bridge In the 1880s a small wooden bridge was erected over Hall's Bayou, then little more than a muddy slough, to allow access to Rincon Point. Bascule Bridge A 1920s era federal Rivers and Harbors Act authorized dredging a channel 25 feet deep and 200 feet wide from the Gulf Of Mexico, through Aransas Pass and on into Hall's Bayou. Dredging was completed and the port was opened, in 1926. The Act also authorized the construction of a 121 foot long, 52 foot wide bascule-type drawbridge. The bridge was built by the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company. Upon completion it was painted black and coated in grease to inhibit corrosion. Bridge operations were complex, consisting of whistled signals between approaching ships and bridge operators. Every ship transit took 20 minutes or more and stopped vehicular traffic for as many as 30 times each day. Harbor Bridge By the 1950s the Bascule bridge was a significant traffic bottleneck. As part of the nationwide interstate highway system, Congress authorized funding for IH-37 through Corpus Christi. This included money for the construction of a new bridge to be elevated over the channel at a height sufficient to allow the passage of ships without stopping vehicular traffic. In 1959 the current Harbor Bridge was completed, allowing ships with a maximum above-waterline height of 138 feet to pass underneath and use a wider portion of the channel than the previous drawbridge. It also included two narrow pedestrian walkways between the bridge railing and the outermost lane of traffic in each direction. Originally designed with a 50-year lifespan, the bridge will remain in service until its replacement is done in 2023. Thereafter, the bridge is slated for demolition. New Harbor Bridge Project The Corpus Christi 2020 Harbor Bridge Under Construction in 2019 In 2008 Local, State, and Federal authorities began the replacement process. The 2020 Harbor Bridge will be a cable-stayed suspension bridge with a 1,661 feet span, rising to a height of 538 feet at the peak of each support pylon. The bridge will allow passage of ships up to 205 feet above-waterline height. The concrete construction technique used for bridge segments have a 170-year estimated life. Construction was originally slated to finish in 2020. On October 15, 2019, it was announced that the Harbor Bridge would not be completed until 2023. On November 15, 2019, design activities on the new Harbor Bridge were suspended by The Texas Department of Transportation. In a statement, the Texas Department of Transportation says it asked Flatiron Dragados, the firm building the bridge, to suspend the design activities until a replacement for FIGG Bridge Engineers Inc. was found after the March 2018 pedestrian bridge collapse at Florida International University . In July of 2020, Arup and Carlos Fernandez Casado S.L. was hired to review, recertify, and complete the main span of the bridge. https://www.constructiondive.com/news/new-engineer-announced-for-800m-harbor- bridge-replacement-in-texas/582424/ Current bridge=New lighting A new LED lighting system was unveiled to the public on December 4, 2011, at a public lighting ceremony held at Whataburger Field.

Known as \\"race movies\\", these films, traditionally independent of Hollywood, were made primarily by, for and about the black community. This documentary is a tribute to a film genre that lasted for more than 40 years, produced over 500 movies, and created a foundation for contemporary films from directors such as Spike Lee and Tyler Perry. James Avery narrates this exploration of the early black film industry. There is a mistaken assumption that \\"race films\\" began largely in reaction to D. W. Griffith's 1915 The Birth of a Nation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Race movies actually began around 1910 in Chicago in response to the Black Community longing to see themselves reflected on the silver screen via this new medium of film. Wanting to see themselves through their own eyes, on their own terms thus counteracting the Hollywood stereotypes within the American media. The film focuses especially on the work of Oscar Micheaux, considered the \\"Dean of Black American film\\", a controversial filmmaker who wrote, produced, and directed over 40 features, and tackled difficult social issues in Black America. It includes clips from films by a number of African-American directors of the period, which is very helpful since many of these films are difficult to find or unavailable.Barnes, Paula C.

With the transition to sound, Micheaux continued to make race films, some of which were controversial even within the Black community. While the advent of sound decreased the number of race films being made, due to the rise in costs, notable films continued to be released.

The revolt saw the formation of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and was one of the key factors contributing to the fall of Assyria; twenty years after the revolt had begun, Nabopolassar's army and that of his ally, Cyaxares of the Medes, had destroyed the Neo-Assyrian Empire.  Background  Since the Neo-Assyrian Empire had conquered Babylon in 729 BC under King Tiglath-Pileser III, the Assyrian kings had been plagued by the \\"Babylonian problem\\"; regular rebellions in the south aimed at restoring independence. Despite many attempts by the Assyrian kings to resolve this issue, such as Sennacherib's destruction of Babylon and Esarhaddon's restoration of it, rebellions and insurrections remained common. The revolt of 626 BC was only the last in a long line of Babylonian uprisings against the Assyrians.''''  Revolt  In 626 BC, early in the reign of the Assyrian king Sinsharishkun, a general called Nabopolassar used the political instability caused by an earlier brief civil war between the king and the general Sin- shumu-lishir to assault the cities of Babylon and Nippur. Nabopolassar was victorious in both battles, but the response from the Assyrians was quick and by October 626 BC the Assyrians had recaptured Nippur and besieged Nabopolassar at the city of Uruk. The Assyrian army failed to capture Babylon and Nabopolassar's garrison at Uruk also successfully repulsed them. On November 22/23 626 BC, Nabopolassar was formally crowned as King of Babylon, the Assyrians having failed to capture and kill him, which restored Babylonia as an independent kingdom after more than a century of Assyrian rule. Sinsharishkun's forces campaigned in northern Babylonia 625‚Äì623 BC and though initially successful (taking the city Sippar and defeating Nabopolassar's attempted reconquest of Nippur), other southern cities, such as Der, began to rise up against the Assyrians at around this time. Sinsharishkun realized the threat a large-scale revolt posed and led a massive counterattack in person, successfully recapturing Uruk, one of Nabopolassar's main seats of power, in 623 BC. Nabopolassar may have ultimately been defeated and control of Babylonia might have been restored had it not been for a 622 BC revolt led by an Assyrian general (whose name remains unknown) in the empire's western provinces. Taking advantage of Sinsharishkun's and the Assyrian army's absence in Babylonia, this general marched on the Assyrian capital of Nineveh where he successfully seized the Assyrian throne.' This development forced Sinsharishkun to abandon his Babylonian campaign and though he successfully defeated the usurper in just a hundred days, his absence allowed the Babylonians to conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia from 622 BC to 620 BC. Both Uruk and Nippur, the cities who had shifted the most between Assyrian and Babylonian control were firmly in Babylonian hands by 620 BC and Nabopolassar had consolidated his rule over all of Babylonia.  Aftermath  After having restored Babylonia as an independent kingdom under himself, Nabopolassar continued to wage war against the Assyrians. By 616 BC he had reached as far north as the Balikh River. Despite Assyria's ally Pharaoh Psamtik I of Egypt joining the conflict, Nabopolassar continued to win victory after victory. In October or November 615 BC, the Medes, another ancient enemy of Assyria, under King Cyaxares entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city Arrapha in preparation for a great final campaign against Sinsharishkun. In July or August of 614 BC, the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of Kalhu and Nineveh and successfully conquered the city Tarbisu. They then besieged Assur. This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria, plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants. Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. Shortly after Assur's fall, Sinsharishkun made his last attempt at a counterattack, rushing to rescue the besieged city of Rahilu, but Nabopolassar's army had retreated before a battle could take place. In April or May 612 BC, at the start of Nabopolassar's fourteenth year as King of Babylon, the combined Medo-Babylonian army marched on Nineveh. From June to August of that year, they besieged the Assyrian capital and in August the walls were breached, leading to a lengthy and brutal sack. Four years later, in 609 BC, the Medo-Babylonian forces decisively defeated the last Assyrian king, Ashur-uballit II, ending the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

The availability of venture funding is among the primary stimuli for the development of new companies and technologies. Features=Parties *Founders or stakeholders. Introduce companies to investors. *A lead investor, typically the best known or most aggressive venture capital firm that is participating in the investment, or the one contributing the largest amount of cash. The lead investor typically oversees most of the negotiation, legal work, due diligence, and other formalities of the investment. It may also introduce the company to other investors, generally in an informal unpaid capacity. *Co-investors, other major investors who contribute alongside the lead investor *Follow-on or piggyback investors. Typically angel investors, rich individuals, institutions, and others who contribute money but take a passive role in the investment and company management *The company being funded *Law firms and accountants are typically retained by all parties to advise, negotiate, and document the transaction Stages in a venture round *Introduction. Investors and companies seek each other out through formal and informal business networks, personal connections, paid or unpaid finders, researchers and advisers, and the like. Because there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors' trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and symposia; and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face-to-face meetings, including a variant known as \\"Speed Venturing\\", which is akin to speed dating for capital, where the investor decides within 10 minutes whether s/he wants a follow-up meeting. *Offering. The company provides the investment firm a confidential business plan to secure initial interest *Private placement memorandum. A PPM/prospectus is generally not used in the Silicon Valley model *Negotiation of terms. Non-binding term sheets, letters of intent, and the like are exchanged back and forth as negotiation documents. Once the parties agree on terms, they sign the term sheet as an expression of commitment. *Signed term sheet. These are usually non-binding and commit the parties only to good faith attempts to complete the transaction on specified terms, but may also contain some procedural promises of limited (30- to 60-day) duration like confidentiality, exclusivity on the part of the company (i.e. the company will not seek funding from other sources), and stand-still provisions (e.g. the company will not undertake any major business changes or enter agreements that would make the transaction infeasible). *Definitive transaction documents. A drawn-out (usually 2‚Äì4 weeks) process of negotiating and drafting a series of contracts and other legal papers used to implement the transaction. In theory, these simply follow the terms of the term sheet. In practice they contain many important details that are beyond the scope of the major deal terms. Definitive transaction documents are not required in all situations. Specifically where the parties have entered into a separate agreement that does not require that the parties execute all such documents. *Definitive documents, the legal papers that document the final transaction. Generally includes: :*Stock purchase agreements the primary contract by which investors exchange money for newly minted shares of preferred stock :*Buy-sell agreements, co-sale agreements, right of first refusal, etc. agreements by which company founders and other owners of common stock agree to limit their individual ability to sell their shares in favor of the new investors :*Investor rights agreements covenants the company makes to the new investors, generally include promises with respect to board seats, negative covenants not to obtain additional financing, sell the company, or make other specified business and financial decisions without the investors' approval, and positive covenants such as inspection rights and promises to provide ongoing financial disclosures :*Amended and restated articles of incorporation formalize issues like authorization and classes of shares and certain investor protections *Due diligence. Simultaneously with negotiating the definitive agreements, the investors examine the financial statements and books and records of the company, and all aspects of its operations. They may require that certain matters be corrected before agreeing to the transaction, e.g. new employment contracts or stock vesting schedules for key executives. At the end of the process the company offers representations and warranties to the investors concerning the accuracy and sufficiency of the company's disclosures, as well as the existence of certain conditions (subject to enumerated exceptions), as part of the stock purchase agreement. *Final agreement occurs when the parties execute all of the transaction documents. This is generally when the funding is announced and the deal considered complete, although there are often rumors and leaks. *Closing occurs when the investors provide the funding and the company provides stock certificates to the investors. Ideally this would be simultaneous, and contemporaneous with the final agreement. However, conventions in the venture community are fairly lax with respect to timing and formality of closing, and generally depend on the goodwill of the parties and their attorneys. To reduce cost and speed up transactions, formalities common in other industries such as escrow of funds, signed original documents, and notarization, are rarely required. This creates some opportunity for incomplete and erroneous paperwork. Some transactions have \\"rolling closings\\" or multiple closing dates for different investors. Others are \\"tranched,\\" meaning the investors only give part of the funds at a time, with the remainder disbursed over time subject to the company meeting specified milestones. *Post-closing. After the closing a few things may occur :*Conversion of convertible notes. If there are outstanding notes they may convert at or after closing. :*securities filing with relevant state and/or federal regulators :*Filing of amended Articles of Incorporation :*Preparation of closing binder contains documentation of entire transaction Rights and privileges Venture investors obtain special privileges that are not granted to holders of common stock. These are embodied in the various transaction documents. Common rights include: :*Anti-dilution protection if the company ever sells a significant amount of stock at a price lower than the investor paid, then to protect investors against stock dilution they are issued additional shares (usually by changing the \\"conversion ratio\\" used to calculate their liquidation preference). :*Guaranteed board seats :*Positive and negative covenants by the company :*Registration right the investors have special rights to demand registration of their stock on public exchanges, and to participate in an initial public offering and subsequent public offerings :*Representations and warranties as to the state of the company :*Liquidation preferences in any liquidation event such as a merger or acquisition, the investors get their money back, often with interest and/or at a multiple, before common stock is paid any funds from liquidation. The preference may be \\"participating\\", in which case the investors get their preference and their proportionate share of the surplus, or \\"non-participating\\" in which case the preference is a floor. :*Dividends dividend amounts are usually stated but not mandatory on the part of the company, except that the investors will get their dividends before any dividends may be declared for common stock. Most venture- backed start-ups are initially unprofitable so dividends are rarely paid. Unpaid dividends are generally forgiven but they may be accumulated and are added to the liquidation preference.  Round names  Venture capital financing rounds typically have names relating to the class of stock being sold: *Seed round where company insiders provide start-up capital *Angel round where early outside investors buy common stock *Series A, Series B, Series C, etc. Generally, the progression and price of stock at these rounds is an indication that a company is progressing as expected. Investors may become concerned when a company has raised too much money in too many rounds, considering it a sign of delayed progress. *Series A', B', and so on. Indicate small follow-on rounds that are integrated into the preceding round, generally on the same terms, to raise additional funds. *Series AA, BB, etc. Once used to denote a new start after a crunchdown or downround, i.e. the company failed to meet its growth objectives and is essentially starting again under the umbrella of a new group of funders. Increasingly, however, Series AA Preferred Stock investment rounds are becoming used more widely along with convertible note financings or other \\"lightweight\\" preferred stock financings, such as \\"Series Seed\\" or \\"Series AA\\" preferred stock, to support less capital- intensive business growth, as their simplicity and generally lower legal costs can be attractive to early investors and founders.ycombinator.com *Mezzanine finance rounds, bridge loans, and other debt instruments used to support a company between venture rounds or before its initial public offering See also * Private equity * Corporate finance * Securities offerings * Securities Act of 1933 References Category:Venture capital ","title":"Venture round"},{"id":"12774030","text":"Psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and writer .

Since 2001, he had been one the six main hosts of the CCTV New Year's Gala, which had a regular audience estimated at several hundred million people each year. He was often used in on-screen and printed promotional material as the public face of CCTV. Li was launched to fame by Lucky 52, a CCTV-2 gameshow with audience figures around 50 million. Based on a British gameshow format (possibly Who Wants to be a Millionaire?). The show aired on Saturdays at 6:55pm. The last air was 25 October 2008 and its repeats, as Li announced/CCTV announced that Lucky 52 would go off air.Jeremy Goldkorn (Danwei) CCTV talent show seeks foreigners with China knowledge He then added Super 6+1, another gameshow broadcast on CCTV-2 on weekend evenings after Xinwen Lianbo.

The CCTV editorial committee omitted him from their \\"top ten\\" list for 2006, perhaps suggesting diminishing support within the organization's management. The original incident later prompted an investigation by CCTV's disciplinary inspection department, on the grounds that it breached SARFT guidelines. Ha denied that Li had endorsed the product, while admitting that he had attended a corporate publicity event for the produce. On 12 January 2007, Li implied Shaanxi citizens were \\"lazy\\" on Lucky 52, prompting criticism on China's influential bulletin boards. He subsequently apologized on his blog. In the 2007 CCTV New Year's Gala, Li and other hosts made a series of mistakes just before midnight, giving rise to the infamous \\"Black Three Minutes\\". The mounting pressure led to rumours in September 2007 that Li had resigned from CCTV. They were denied by Lucky 52.Yahoo! China: Li Yong leaving Lucky 52 is rumour only.

For example, every Suslin tree is an Aronszajn tree. More generally, for a cardinal Œ∫, a Œ∫-Aronszajn tree is a tree of cardinality Œ∫ in which all levels have size less than Œ∫ and all branches have height less than Œ∫ (so Aronszajn trees are the same as \\\\aleph_1-Aronszajn trees). They are named for Nachman Aronszajn, who constructed an Aronszajn tree in 1934; his construction was described by . A cardinal Œ∫ for which no Œ∫-Aronszajn trees exist is said to have the tree property (sometimes the condition that Œ∫ is regular and uncountable is included). Existence of Œ∫-Aronszajn trees K≈ënig's lemma states that \\\\aleph_0-Aronszajn trees do not exist. The existence of Aronszajn trees (=\\\\aleph_1-Aronszajn trees) was proven by Nachman Aronszajn, and implies that the analogue of K≈ënig's lemma does not hold for uncountable trees. The existence of \\\\aleph_2-Aronszajn trees is undecidable (assuming a certain large cardinal axiom): more precisely, the continuum hypothesis implies the existence of an \\\\aleph_2-Aronszajn tree, and Mitchell and Silver showed that it is consistent (relative to the existence of a weakly compact cardinal) that no \\\\aleph_2-Aronszajn trees exist. Jensen proved that V = L implies that there is a Œ∫-Aronszajn tree (in fact a Œ∫-Suslin tree) for every infinite successor cardinal Œ∫. showed (using a large cardinal axiom) that it is consistent that no \\\\aleph_n-Aronszajn trees exist for any finite n other than 1\\\\. If Œ∫ is weakly compact then no Œ∫-Aronszajn trees exist. Conversely if Œ∫ is inaccessible and no Œ∫-Aronszajn trees exist then Œ∫ is weakly compact. Special Aronszajn trees An Aronszajn tree is called special if there is a function f from the tree to the rationals so that f(x) < f(y) whenever x < y. Martin's axiom MA(\\\\aleph_1) implies that all Aronszajn trees are special. The stronger proper forcing axiom implies the stronger statement that for any two Aronszajn trees there is a club set of levels such that the restrictions of the trees to this set of levels are isomorphic, which says that in some sense any two Aronszajn trees are essentially isomorphic . On the other hand, it is consistent that non-special Aronszajn trees exist, and this is also consistent with the generalized continuum hypothesis plus Suslin's hypothesis . Construction of a special Aronszajn tree A special Aronszajn tree can be constructed as follows. The elements of the tree are certain well-ordered sets of rational numbers with supremum that is rational or ‚àí‚àû. If x and y are two of these sets then we define x ‚â§ y (in the tree order) to mean that x is an initial segment of the ordered set y. For each countable ordinal Œ± we write UŒ± for the elements of the tree of level Œ±, so that the elements of UŒ± are certain sets of rationals with order type Œ±. The special Aronszajn tree T is the union of the sets UŒ± for all countable Œ±. We construct the countable levels UŒ± by transfinite induction on Œ± as follows starting with the empty set as U0: *If Œ± + 1 is a successor then UŒ±+1 consists of all extensions of a sequence x in UŒ± by a rational greater than sup x. UŒ± + 1 is countable as it consists of countably many extensions of each of the countably many elements in UŒ±. *If Œ± is a limit then let TŒ± be the tree of all points of level less than Œ±. For each x in TŒ± and for each rational number q greater than sup x, choose a level Œ± branch of TŒ± containing x with supremum q. Then UŒ± consists of these branches. UŒ± is countable as it consists of countably many branches for each of the countably many elements in TŒ±. The function f(x) = sup x is rational or ‚àí‚àû, and has the property that if x < y then f(x) < f(y). Any branch in T is countable as f maps branches injectively to ‚àí‚àû and the rationals. T is uncountable as it has a non-empty level UŒ± for each countable ordinal Œ± which make up the first uncountable ordinal. This proves that T is a special Aronszajn tree. This construction can be used to construct Œ∫-Aronszajn trees whenever Œ∫ is a successor of a regular cardinal and the generalized continuum hypothesis holds, by replacing the rational numbers by a more general Œ∑ set.

He has been described as \\"an archetypal outsider ‚Äì illegitimate, homosexual, self-educated and antipodean\\". Early life Born as Reginald Nankivell in Christchurch, New Zealand, to an unmarried mother, he was raised in the home of his maternal grandparents. He was educated at New Brighton Public School and the Royal College of Science. Becoming a collector and dealer As an under age youth and listing his profession as bookbinder, Reginald Nankivell enlisted with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force on 31 May 1916.Reginald Nankivell No 27034; WWI NZEF Military Personnel Record (online) He served in England (1916‚Äì1919) on the staff of No. 1 New Zealand Hospital General Hospital, Brockenhurst, Hampshire (part of his collection of photos was taken here) and at the New Zealand Command Depot, Codford, Wiltshire. On an extended period of leave in England, from October 1917 to May 1918, he began to pursue his growing antiquarian interests. Around 1918 he started to style himself Rex de Charembac Nan Kivell. He attributed an early interest in collecting to Sydney Smith, an antiquarian book dealer in Christchurch whom Nan Kivell met while still at school. Nan Kivell was also inspired to read history and geography, especially works on European voyagers in the Pacific. Patients and medical staff at No.1 New Zealand General Hospital, Brockenhurst Nan Kivell worked on the La T√®ne archaeological excavations in Wiltshire, and presented the objects he unearthed to the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society Museum in Devizes. Nan Kivell's association with the Redfern Gallery began in 1925. It had been founded two years earlier by two wealthy Englishmen and by 1931, Nan Kivell was managing director. He ran the gallery in association with his Australian business partner, Harry Tatlock Miller. There seems to be little doubt that the Redfern was a significant force in stimulating British conservative taste to embrace modern and new art. Through the Redfern Gallery, Nan Kivell encouraged and helped to establish many British artists including Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Graham Sutherland. He also helped to introduce a number of important European artists to England such as Pierre Bonnard, Chaim Soutine, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso and √âdouard Vuillard. He gave encouragement to an emerging generation of Australian painters and designers including Sidney Nolan and Loudon Sainthill. Although living mainly in London, he also maintained a mansion named El Farah (Paradise) in Morocco, where he maintained a long-running sexual relationship with his local chauffeur.Helen Musa, \\"A collector's paradise\\", The Canberra Times, 1 August 1998, Panorama, p. 12 The Rex Nan Kivell Collection By visiting galleries and becoming familiar with the work of contemporary artists, Nan Kivell began to develop the skills of discrimination and connoisseurship that would mark his future career as both a successful art dealer and collector. His success arose from his taste and judgement in recognising gifted artists before their reputations became widely established. At the same time, as a private hobby, he began to collect books, paintings, prints, documents, manuscripts and artefacts relating to the history of Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.

Part of Sketchbook Birds & flowers of New South Wales drawn on the spot in 1788, '89 & '90 1788‚Äì1790thumbright Originally conceived as the basis of a pictorial history of Australia and New Zealand, Nan Kivell's collection began to extend beyond the purely pictorial. It came to encompass a whole range of documentary evidence created during the voyages of discovery, exploration and colonisation of the Antipodes in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the material produced as a result of those voyages. Items in a variety of media from early maps, navigational instruments, etchings and pamphlets to oil paintings, manuscripts and important first editions were collected for the light that they could shed on European activity in the region. In going beyond the portraits of the elite and artworks judged at the time to be aesthetically important, to materials collected for their possible documentary importance, Nan Kivell both anticipated and provided the material for a re-evaluation of the history of the Australian, New Zealand, and Pacific region. The Rex Nan Kivell Collection also includes Maori ceremonial war clubs, Maori language publications and manuscripts, emu eggs, scrimshaw, Aboriginal king plates, a compass and sundial and Thomas Baines‚Äô magnificent painted lantern slides of the mid-1850s. He also collected books, prints, watercolours, photographs, letters and government documents. Part of the pictorial collection includes works by artists such as S. T. Gill, George French Angas, Eugene von Guerard, Sydney Parkinson, Nicholas Chevalier, the Port Jackson Painter, Conrad Martens, John Lewin, Joseph Lycett and Augustus Earle. Fine copies of the most basic early works on Pacific and Australian discovery and settlement such as William Dampier, James Cook, William Bligh, the French explorers, Joseph Banks and Arthur Phillip are to be found in the collection. The collection is especially rich in unusual Bounty items. By the late 1940s, Nan Kivell's collection had become substantial and was housed in various locations around England. In 1946, concerned about the safety and preservation of the collection, Nan Kivell began negotiations with representatives in London of the then Commonwealth National Library, the present day National Library of Australia (NLA). He was adamant that the collection should stay together and should also be available for use. In 1949 the first consignment of pictures, books and other material reached Canberra on loan to the Library, which then sought, over a decade, to bring the collection into Australian ownership. Although Nan Kivell was unfailingly generous in honouring his commitment to allow the Library full use of his collection, he was cautious in defining any agreement concerning its ultimate disposition, or in stating terms of its donation or sale. In 1959, he sold his collection to the Australian government for ‚Ç§STG 70,000, a fraction of its true value. This modest price, combined with his later gifts to the NLA, established him as one of the country's greatest cultural benefactors. Despite a number of invitations, he never visited Australia and never returned to New Zealand. In 1953 he had donated hundreds of contemporary prints by British artists to New Zealand institutions for the fine arts. Nan Kivell's collection totals over 15,000 items which includes more than 253 oils, 1,587 lithographs, 306 aquatints, 780 watercolours, some 5,000 books, and has exercised a substantial and enduring influence on Australasian historical and artistic scholarship. In 1992, 32 works from the collection were placed on long-term loan to the National Gallery of Australia. This arrangement was ordered by the then Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating, after the National Gallery and National Library disputed ownership of the collection. Honours On the recommendation of the Australian Government, Nan Kivell was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1966 for \\"services to the Australian National Library\\". In 1976 he was made a Knight Bachelor, again by Australia. It has been suggested one of his motivations in selling his collection of Australiana at a fraction of its true value was to gain the knighthood he had long coveted for the purposes of social advancement. On the recommendation of the Monarch and government of Denmark, Nan Kivell was also awarded the Order of Dannebrog. However, the author of his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography casts some doubt on the veracity of this. Death He died on 7 June 1977 in Paddington, London and was buried in the parish churchyard at West Lavington, Wiltshire. He attempted to obscure his illegitimacy even beyond the grave, by having a false date of birth inscribed on his tomb.

WSIPC services schools throughout the northwest in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, providing benefits to 9 Educational Service Districts and more than 300 school districts, who represent over 1 million students. WSIPC serves school districts with complete information management systems for fiscal, human resources as well as a full student information system (SIS) data. The main software package deployed by WSIPC is the Skyward School Management System. Starting in 2009 WSIPC was given the sole responsibility to host WASWUG Spring and WASWUG Fall, two conferences that are in place for WSIPC members to learn more about the Skyward product suite and attend breakout sessions. History In 1967, ten Washington school districts formed a cooperative to share software development and hardware costs, and provide centralized technological support. The result of this collaboration was WSIPC, a public agency that continues to provide information services at a low cost to school districts in the northwest. WSIPC registered the domain name WEDNET.EDU in 1992 in order to begin connecting all public schools in Washington state. This eventually became the nation's first statewide high-speed, high-capacity network for schools, which was made possible by WSIPC joining the Washington K-20 Network in 2000. This linked colleges, universities, K-12 school districts and libraries statewide, resulting in more bandwidth and connectivity with schools. According to the K-20 Biennial Report of December 2006, joining the network \\"enabled WSIPC and the ESDs to serve local districts more effectively\\" because without it, each school district would have been left to find a locally delivered system. Initially, WSIPC had developed their own Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application in-house, called WISE, which not only provided a complete SIS, but also information management for both finance and student data. Starting in 2001 WSIPC collaborated with Skyward and, as a result, completely restructured the computing infrastructure at WSIPC, replacing the legacy application offerings with one integrated ERP application provided to WSIPC customers. WSIPC called its ERP application WESPaC (WSIPC Enhanced Skyward Point and Click) which included Skyward's software suite of student, human resources and financial management modules. WESPaC also included Citrix's MetaFrame which provided users with remote access. Skyward eventually converted its thick client student application into a web interface and part of its finance software to have a web front end. The other part of their finance software is still thick client. Therefore, WESPaC has now evolved into two applications, one being a web-based student application and the other being a finance application that is partly web-based and partly thick client. Both of these applications are currently provided by Skyward. In 2003 WSIPC provided a case study for Citrix stating the revenue saved over 5 years, which amounted to almost $54 million. It stated that implementing Citrix has helped WSIPC \\"cut costs, rapidly deploy and centrally manage the Skyward application, roll out updates immediately, and provide for a more stable operating environment.\\" By the end of 2004, the entire WSIPC user base began using Citrix. This software company currently enables WSIPC to centrally deploy and manage their applications, also allowing their finance software (or PaC) to be accessed via a variety of client devices. This, in turn, offers a management infrastructure that requires little management on the school district's part. In 2014, WSIPC launched a web application it had developed called My School Data that provides access to student data and assessment information in a dashboard format. WASWUG WASWUG is the biannual gathering of WSIPC members to learn more about the Skyward product suite, share insights and network. Throughout the three-day conference there are over 175 breakout sessions offered within the Student, HR and Fiscal Modules. These sessions are taught by the WSIPC Staff and power end users. The WASWUG Conference first began in 2005 with hosting duties being rotated among various Washington State Education Service Districts. The total attendance of the first conference was over 800. The attendance has increased to over 1400 attendees by 2014. From 2009 onward, WSIPC was given the sole responsibility to arrange and organize WASWUG. WASWUG Fall is an additional yearly conference that was added in 2015. It is currently located in Spokane, WA in order to better reach districts in eastern Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska and Montana. The original conference was rebranded as WASWUG Spring typically with a specific theme every year and is currently located in Bellevue, WA.

It is distributed throughout the United States and internationally, currently in 60 nations. Founded by Sivaya Subramuniyaswami in 1979, it is a public service of his monastic order to promote an understanding of the Hindu faith, culture, and traditions. History and topics 1991: The founder, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, celebrating the magazine with followers in Malaysia.25 years later: January 2016 issue of Hinduism Today'Hinduism Today was launched in 1979 by Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (Gurudeva), published by his non-profit organization Himalayan Academy. Originally The New Saivite World, the magazine was a small black-and-white periodical without a fixed publication schedule. The first issue appeared February 1979, with the goal of giving a voice to Gurudeva's worldwide fellowship in a way that was easy to read, simple to produce, mail and handle. The newsletter was to be a people-oriented paper, not so much devoted to philosophy or teaching since the Himalayan Academy was publishing books on Hindu-related metaphysical topics as early as 1957. Over the years, Hinduism Today has evolved to embrace everything of interest to a Hindu. In 1996, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami upgraded the newspaper Hinduism Today to a magazine. Recently, another milestonewas reached when the magazine became available online. The physical magazine now utilizes high-grade printing material, which is dipped in an attractive glaze. Photographs, drawings, and the magazine's aesthetically tuned interior design further add to the magazine's unique ability to convey the sensibilities of an entire culture through the print medium. Advertisements are designed and placed together at the end of each issue so as to avoid any hindrance to the reading experience. The over 275,000 readers of the magazine primarily reside in North America, Europe, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Africa and Mauritius.John Labovitz's eZine list The magazine presents through a Hindu perspective a wide range of topics, pressing both to society and the individual. These topics include, but are not limited to, the following: education, culture, cosmology, philosophy, ethics, sociology, film, music, spirituality, food, and travel. The profound, yet simple writings of the magazine's contributors offer a sensible and inspiring variety of topics encompassing the influence of every sphere of Hindu culture and religion. In addition to regular writers, contributors include the magazine‚Äôs readers as well as the collective wisdom of major thinkers of both the eastern and western traditions, as captured in the magazine's regularly included quotations section. Informative articles also offer profound insights into modern life, with topics such as yoga, vegetarianism, meditation, nonviolence, environmental ethics and family life. Ram Swarup (1920-1998), founder of the Voice of India, explains: \\"Hinduism Today is international in thought and spiritual sensibility. It presents Hinduism's new global face. It takes a strategic lead in the effort to overcome the problem of self- alienation and growing illiteracy among the Hindus of their heritage. In the eyes of many Hindus who are concerned with the problems of Hindu renaissance, Hinduism Today is easily the best magazine Hindus have.\\" Service to Hindu spirituality Inside the Media Studio, the headquarters for Hinduism Today on the island of Kauai.Observes Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (Gurudeva): \\"Hinduism Today was created to strengthen all the many diverse expressions of Hindu spirituality, to give them a single, combined voice because everywhere else their voices were individualized. There was nothing that encompassed the whole Hindu experience around the world. Every religious order has a mission and instead of starting an eye-clinic or an orphanage, we created a global publication to advance the cause of Hindu Dharma.\\"The Story of Hinduism Today by Lavina Melwani While Hindus living in India are surrounded by their culture and faith, Hinduism Todays mandate is to also reach the millions of Hindus who are trying to keep their faith alive in far-off places surrounded by different cultures. Specific goals of the magazine include: 1\\\\. To foster Hindu solidarity as a unity in diversity among all sects and lineages; 2\\\\. To inform and inspire Hindus worldwide and people interested in Hinduism; 3\\\\. To dispels myths, illusions and misinformation about Hinduism; 4\\\\. To protect, preserve and promote the sacred Vedas and the Hindu religion; 5\\\\. To nurture and monitor the ongoing spiritual Hindu renaissance; 6\\\\. To publish a resource for Hindu leaders and educators who promote Sanatana Dharma. As a highly objective magazine with such a diverse presentation of thought, its appeal extends far beyond the Hindu community, especially to those interested in its portrayal of Hindu culture, as well as the thought processes and sentiment used to convey this content.

It is located adjacent to and northeast of East Jerusalem and to the west of Ma'ale Adumim. It covers an area of , which is home to a number of Bedouin communities and their livestock as well as a large Israeli police headquarters. The Palestinian tent site of Bab al Shams, which was established for several days in early 2013, also lay within this area. There are Israeli plans for construction in E1, named the E1 Plan, frozen since at least 2009 under international pressure. This plan is not synonymous with the expansion of Ma'ale Adumim. The plan was initially conceived by Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. Construction in E1 is controversial. Critics say that the plan aims at preventing any possible expansion of East Jerusalem by creating a physical link between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem,possible peace between Israel and Palestine, By Menachem Klein, Haim Watzman, Columbia University Press, 2007, , , Page 74. and that it would effectively complete a crescent of Israeli settlements around East Jerusalem dividing it from the rest of the West Bank and its Palestinian population centres, and create a continuous Jewish population between Jerusalem and Ma'ale Adumim. It would also nearly bisect the West Bank jeopardizing the prospects of a contiguous Palestinian state. Palestinians describe the E1 plan as an effort to Judaize Jerusalem.Weekly Report: On Israeli Human Rights Violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , Palestinian Center for Human Rights, accessdate 6 May 2009Jerusalem , Passia, accessdate 6 May 2009U.S. Moment of Truth on Palestinian ‚Äì Israeli Conflict, Global GeoPolitics News, accessdate 6 May 2009 The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Geography Situated in the West Bank, the E1 area is bordered by the French Hill neighborhood of Jerusalem to the west, Abu Dis to the southwest, Kedar to the south, Ma'ale Adumim to the east, and Almon to the north. The area is mountainous and covers almost 3,000 acres. The E1 area runs between the easternmost edges of annexed East Jerusalem and nearby Ma'ale Adumim, a large Israeli settlement located East of the pre-1967 green line. E1 falls within Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli military and civilian control, and is administered by Ma'ale Adumim. History During the government of Yitzhak Shamir in 1991 part of the area currently known as E1 was transferred to the Ma'ale Adumim local council. In January 1994, the Higher Planning Council of Judea and Samaria's Subcommittee for Settlement tabled a new plan that expanded the municipal plan for Ma'ale Adumim and, in effect, constituted the basis for the future E1 Plan. Yitzhak Rabin expanded the borders of Ma'ale Adumim to include the area known as E1 and instructed Housing Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer to begin planning a neighborhood at the location. Rabin, however, refrained from implementing any construction in the E1 area. From then on, planning and authorization procedures for the E1 neighborhood were promoted but were never totally completed, given the diplomatic constraints. Following the legal terms of the Oslo II Interim Agreement from 28 September 1995. The area E1 was designated as Area C, where Israel retained the powers of zoning and planning. Despite long-standing plans for the municipality of Ma'aleh Adumim to build 3000 new housing units on the E1 territory, Israel undertook unilateral limitations upon itself in this area.Second Ma πale Adumim outline plan 420/4, approved 1999. Since Yitzhak Rabin every Israeli prime minister has supported the plan to create Israeli urban contiguity between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem: On 13 March 1996, Prime Minister Shimon Peres reaffirmed the government's position that Israel will demand applying Israeli sovereignty over Ma‚Äôaleh Adumim in the framework of a permanent peace agreement. Yossi Beilin, a dovish politician and co-author of the Geneva Initiative, supported annexing Ma‚Äôaleh Adumim. According to a document of understandings between former minister Yossi Beilin and Mahmoud Abbas from the mid-1990s, while some Jerusalem Arab neighborhoods were to be transferred to a future Palestinian state, Israel was to annex the Jewish communities around Jerusalem, such as Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Beitar, and Efrat. According to the Clinton outline for partitioning Jerusalem that arose in the talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Israel was to be compensated for partitioning the city by annexing Ma'ale Adumim. During the Ehud Barak government, the Prime Minister expressed support for E1 but refrained from undertaking any construction in the E1 area. Barak did place the issue of E1 on the negotiating table at Taba and the matter remained unresolved when the Taba talks broke up. In 2002, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer the Minister of Defense signed the Master Plan for E1 (expedited, but not approved under Netanyahu administration) into law. Ben Eliezer subsequently pledged to the U.S. administration not to implement the E1 plan, and indeed no further statutory planning was carried out and there was no construction in E1 during his tenure in office. In mid-2004, construction commenced on infrastructure in E1. The work was carried out by the Ministry of Construction and was illegal: in the absence of a Specific Town Plan, no permits could be or were issued to allow for this work. The work included the clearing of roads for major highways leading to the planned residential areas and site preparation for the planned police station which would also incorporate the police station in Ras Al Amud which would be transferred there. During the 2007 Annapolis Conference, then-prime minister Ehud Olmert and then-foreign minister Tzipi Livni demanded that Ma‚Äôaleh Adumim remain a part of Israel. During the Netanyahu government, the Prime Minister attempted to expedite the E1 Master Plan. A first statutory step to implementation of the plan, which includes general land designations but is not specific enough to allow the issuance of building permits, was undertaken, along with the establishment of a Greater Jerusalem umbrella municipality which was to include Ma'ale Adumim. Netanyahu's also declared that \\"the State of Israel will continue to build in Jerusalem and in all the places on the state‚Äôs strategic map\\" is a continuation of the political tradition that views control over E1 as a cardinal Israeli interest. Since 2008, the headquarters of the Judea and Samaria district of the Israeli Police Department are situated in the E1. In December 2012, in response to the United Nations approving the Palestinian bid for \\"non-member observer state\\" status, Israel announced the next day that it was resuming planning and zoning work in E1 area. EU ministers expressed their \\"dismay\\" and five European countries summoned Israeli ambassadors to protest. E1 Plan The plan for the E1 area within the municipal boundary of Ma'ale Adumim, sought to develop the area in order to link Ma'ale Adumim and its 40,000 residents to Jerusalem. It entails building about 3,500-15,000 housing units, the now-completed police headquarters of the Judea and Samaria district, as well as a large industrial zone, tourism, and commercial areas. Also a garbage dump and a large cemetery to be shared by Jerusalem and Ma'ale Adumim. The proposed construction of a further new road around the settlement of Kedar in 2009 was also seen as attempting to facilitate residential development in E1. The disputed E1 area is located in the West Bank and spans the area between Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim. The land in question comprises about 12,000 dunams, which is roughly . If the E1 plan is fully implemented Palestinians could, theoretically, travel between the northern and southern West Bank via a road that at this time does not exist, looping around the Ma'ale Adumim bloc and the expanded area of Jerusalem. There have also been suggestions for an alternate road route for Palestinians running north‚Äìsouth between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem that uses overpasses and tunnels to bypass Israeli settlements. Objectives The Israeli government says that the E1 plan is critical to Israeli national security interests and poses no threat to the formation of a continuous Palestinian state in the West Bank. Israeli military officials claim that E1 is necessary for Israel to possess defensible borders, primarily for the protection of the capital, Jerusalem. Despite his conservative background, many Israelis accuse the current Prime Minister, Bejnamin Netanyahu, of holding back settlement plans in a bid to please the Obama administration. According to the Palestinian presidential chief of staff, Rafiq Husseini, \\"The E1 plan would separate the northern and southern West Bank from East Jerusalem, which would prevent the establishment of Palestinian state\\". However, an area 12 miles wide between Ma'Ale Adumim and the Jordan River would still exist under Palestinian control, according to Olmert's 2008 offer and Israel's offer at the Camp David Summit. The E-1 plan does not geographically prohibit those offers from being implemented. Though critics say that the plan is intended to cut off Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, Palestinian neighborhoods like Abu Dis in East Jerusalem would still have access to the West Bank. Once the E1 plan is implemented, Palestinians will be able to travel from Bethlehem to Ramallah by going around Ma'ale Adumim. The Israeli government offered in 2008 under then Israeli premiere Ehud Olmert to build a road as part of a comprehensive settlement connecting Bethlehem and Ramallah, but the Palestinians rejected it. Controversy=Palestinian Contiguity Road Construction in the area is a subject of controversy. Palestinians say that it would prevent contiguity between the northern and southern areas of the West Bank making \\"the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state almost impossible\\" and increase travel time between Ramallah region north of Jerusalem to the Bethlehem region to the south. This would make it harder to reach agreement over permanent borders. The United States, EU and UN have supported the Palestinian position and has sought to block Israeli construction at the site, pending a final peace agreement. According to the UN and EU, construction in this area will deal a \\"fatal blow\\" to the two-state solution and make it \\"almost inconceivable\\". Israeli governments have so far avoided construction in E1 due to international pressure. To address Palestinian concerns, Israel has constructed a series of bypass roads that allow access from East Jerusalem to the West Bank. The total cost of construction was estimated in 2009 as amounting to (approx. ) for the previous two years. The building of this infrastructure was interpreted as motivated by a desire to \\"claim\\" the E1 area ahead of constructing residential neighborhoods. Israel claims that E1 plans have been regarded as strategically important for Jerusalem's security by all of Israel's former Prime Ministers since Prime Minister Rabin appended E1 to Ma'ale Adumim. According to Ma'ale Adumim Mayor Bennie Kashriel, Mvasseret Adumim is needed to allow continuous natural growth in Ma'ale Adumim, and is essential for Ma'ale Adumim's security. Without Mvasseret Adumim, Ma'ale Adumim is detached from Jerusalem ‚Äî which is a 12-minute car ride away, and is vulnerable to anyone who seizes the E1 range. Ma'ale Adumim is often compared to Mount Scopus, an Israeli settlement under UN control threatened during multiple conflicts from 1948 to 1967. Israel also claims to have the legal authority to continue building and that a bypass road, the proposed solution to a continuous Palestinian state to be an acceptable solution that the PA agreed to in the past. International opposition There has been wide- scale opposition to the plan ‚Äì opposition mobilized originally by lawyers and activists, including those associated with Peace Now, who closely follow developments in Jerusalem. The United States has historically opposed the plan, with Israel stopping its construction under pressure of the Bush Administration. In 2009, Israel conducted an additional understanding with the United States government not to build in the E1 zone. In 2012, Israel announced its intention to build 3,000 new housing units in the zone. A prominent Israel official explained the decision by stating that the agreement with the American government was \\"no longer relevant,\\" claiming that the Palestinian Authority had \\"fundamentally violated\\" their prior agreements. Israel's 2012 plan to move ahead with construction of 3,000 housing units in the E1 zone was faced with widespread international opposition. In particular, the European Union put strong diplomatic pressure on Israel to reverse its decision, and Britain and France threatened to take the unprecedented action of withdrawing their ambassadors in reaction. The Palestinian Authority threatened to sue Israel in the International Criminal Court for international law and human rights violations over the E1 plan. Bedouin communities At least eighteen Bedouin tribes have their homes in E1. These include the Jahalin Bedouin who state they resided in the E1 area since the 1950s with the consent of the landowners from Abu Dis and al-Eizariya, whereas the Israel claimed that it was only around the year 1988 that groups of the Jahalin tribe began to settle there and on adjacent lands.HCJ 2966/95, Muhammad Ahmad Salem Harash and nineteen others v Minister of Defense et al., Takdin Elyon 96(2) 866 (1996), par 2. Israeli efforts to remove the Jahalin Bedouin who live on the E1 lands have also been interpreted as preparing the ground for settlement construction. The European Union submitted a formal protest to the Israeli Foreign Ministry over evacuating Bedouin and tearing down Palestinians' houses in the E1 area in December 2011. Israel denied that such evacuations were a preparation for settlement construction. In February 2012, Israeli authorities abandoned plans to resettle the Jahalin Bedouin to the Abu Dis garbage dump, but confirmed their intention to concentrate them in one location, which would be contrary to their traditional nomadic lifestyle, based on animals grazing. On 16 September 2014 it was announced that they would be moved to a new area in the Jordan Valley north of Jericho. Bab al Shams On 11 January 2013, a group of about 250 Palestinian and foreign activists saying that they wanted to establish \\"facts of the ground\\" moved into the area to erect a tent site, which they wanted to develop into a village called Bab al-Shams. Following a supreme court ruling and less than 48 hours after beginning protest the activists were forcibly evacuated, but the tent site was left for six days while the issue of its removal was being discussed.

Commissioned too late for service in that conflict, she had a lengthy career in the Cold War that followed. She was the only U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Canisteo, after the Canisteo River in New York. Canisteo (AO-99) was launched 6 July 1945 by Bethlehem Steel-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc., Sparrows Point, Maryland, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. J. N. Chambers; and commissioned 3 December 1945, Lieutenant Commander E. L. Denton, USNR, in command. Service history= Post-World War II operations  Canisteo cleared Norfolk 4 February 1946 for Melville, Rhode Island, where she loaded diesel oil for naval units taking part in the occupation of Germany. Returning from Bremerhaven and Farge, Germany, she carried out training operations in the Caribbean, and then sailed to Iceland and Greenland, returning to New York City 27 May.  Participating in Antarctic exercises  The tanker sailed south from Norfolk 27 November 1946 as a unit of Operation Highjump, the largest Antarctic expedition to that time. Steaming through the Panama Canal to the Antarctic, Canisteo reached Scott and Peter Islands and provided critical logistic support for this historic exploratory and scientific project, carrying on the Navy's traditional role in expanding man's frontiers. Canisteo returned to Norfolk 23 April 1947 after calling at Rio de Janeiro and Caribbean ports.  North Atlantic operations  Canisteo¬¥s appearance after her jumboization in the 1960s. Between 4 June 1947 and 23 October 1948, Canisteo served four tours of duty supporting the U.S. 6th Fleet by carrying oil from Bahrain to the Mediterranean. The winter and spring of 1948‚Äì1949 found Canisteo operating on fueling duty from Norfolk, Virginia, to Caribbean ports; Argentia, Newfoundland; and Gr√∏nnedal, Greenland. A pattern of alternating exercises in the Caribbean with overhauls and tours of duty in the Mediterranean in the following years was highlighted by her fueling in support of many fleet exercises. She played a part in augmenting the growing strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through Operation Mainbrace (26 August-11 October 1952) and in combined operations with Canadian forces (16‚Äì20 September 1956). The first shipboard test of the Ships Inertial Navigation System (SINS) was conducted aboard Canisteo during a 15-day Mediterranean cruise.Inertial Navigation by Richard H. Parvin, Van Nostrand, 1962 - Global Positioning System, Page 12 Active with the Fleet, Canisteo continued to operate out of Norfolk through 1960, participating in fleet and NATO exercises. Between 1966 and 1968 Canisteo, along with her sister ships Ashtabula and Caloosahatchee, underwent \\"jumboization\\". A midsection, built entirely new from the keel up, was inserted and welded between her original bow and stern. This replaced the old midsection and increased the vessel's liquid cargo capacity by over one- third. Her new configuration closely resembled that of a more modern type of ship, the replenishment oiler. Morale on the ship was poor in the late 1970s. Recruiters for the early all-volunteer US Navy were fairly desperate for inductees, and this showed no where more clearly than in the crew of Canisteo. In 1979 she returned from a tour of duty in the Mediterranean to Norfolk, Virginia (her home port). So many men went AWOL that she could not return to sea on schedule, the first time that had happened to a US Navy ship since the Revolutionary War. The afore mentioned claim is disputed by Capt. T. E. Shanahan, Commanding Officer 1978-1980, in a YouTube video \\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHlowLNuBjI\\" Published on May 31, 2012, wherein he says defense spending cuts were to blame for the ship not deploying on time in 1979 but there was more to the story than he is telling. In the late summer early fall of 1978 the Canisteo was on deployment in the Caribbean and morale on the ship was so poor that 3 men jumped overboard at sea within 2 days. All 3 were recovered. The ship was immediately returned to port in Norfolk, Virginia and just days out from port a Navel investigating team was helicoptered onboard to investigate the incidents. The ship‚Äôs captain and about half of the crew were replaced and the Canisteo was deployed on the unscheduled Mediterranean cruise of 1978-1979. Canisteo recovered from this notoriety in the 1980s by participating in Caribbean operations from January 1982 through January 1983, North Atlantic and NATO operations from January through April 1983, and in law enforcement operations in support of the War on Drugs in the Caribbean, August 1985 through January 1986. At the end of the law enforcement operations, Canisteo participated in wreckage recovery operations off the coast of Florida for the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  Decommissioning and disposal  Canisteo decommissioned 2 October 1989 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, 31 August 1992. She was transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River, Fort Eustis, Virginia. Canisteo was sold for scrapping to Able UK, Hartlepool, Teesside, England, and removed from the Reserve Fleet under tow, arriving in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2003. Canisteo and three other decommissioned US Navy ships, Caloosahatchee,Canopus and Compass Island all arrived at Able UK under the same contract and came to be known as the \\"Hartlepool Four\\". Local protests and legal challenges, alleging unacceptable amounts of toxic substances contained on and in the vessels, delayed scrapping until Able UK secured the appropriate waste management licensing in August 2008. Scrapping of Canisteo finally commenced in March 2010 and was completed by August 2010.

Geography The sylvan, rugged land is located on the banks of the Kunti, a slender rivulet that forms tributary to the broad, west-flowing Bharatapuzha that criss-crosses central Kerala in southern India. Art and culture It is famous for the huge number of Kathakali and traditional Kerala percussion artistes it has churned out over a period of decades and centuries‚Äîin a hoary way in its feudal past, and at a relatively slower place in today's liberal-economy world. The nearest small town is Cherpulassery, some seven kilometres away. Art Village Though Vellinezhi was known for its tradition of Art and as a birthplace of many famous artists, the idea of Kalagramam is a recent development. It all started with the publication of a series of articles about Vellinezhi, under the title Kaliyarangite Paitrukam (The Tradition of Kathakali Theatre) in the Malayalam Daily Malayala Manorama during July 9-14, 2012. These articles projected the traditional importance of Vellinezhi and its art forms. Another daily Mathrubhumi followed the suit for two days (July 12, 13). From 21 to 27 August Malayala Manorama conducted a Seminar on the subject of Kalagramam. This Seminar kindled interest and awareness in public and many Subsequently, the matter was put up to higher governmental authorities. Cultural Organisations, Artistes and connoisseurs unanimously supported the project put forward by Malayala Manorama. Hon. District Collector Sri P. M. Ali Asgar Pasha, IAS took special interest and on his request, the District Tourism Promotion Council came forward with Development programmes. Sri P. N. Suresh, Hon. Vice- Chancellor, Kalamandalam The Deemed University of Arts drafted a detailed plan for execution to bring the dream to reality. On October 13th Sri. Anil Kumar, Hon. Minister of Tourism inaugurated the Seminar on Vellinezhi Kalagramam. In this function, the Minister officially declared Vellinezhi as Kalagramam. In the open forum discussion M. P. Rajesh (Hon. M.P ), Smt. K.S. Saleekha (Hon. M.L.A.), P. N. Suresh (Hon. Vice-chancellor, Kalamandalam Deemed University of Arts), K.A. Francis (Chairman, Kerala Lalithakala Academy), T.N.

Damodaran Nambuthiripad, Roy Philip (Co- ordinating Editor, Malayala Manorama) and many distinguished personalities from all political parties and from different walks of life actively participated. They unanimously offered their whole-hearted support for the concept of Kalagramam. On January 5, 2013, a formal official meeting was called by the District Collector in his chamber. The plan of operation was discussed. It was felt that an advisory body is to be formed for planning and executing Kalagramam Projects. As a result of this Dr. Vellinezhi Achuthankutty was appointed as chief coordinator of Kalagramam project. Dr.Vellinezhi Achuthankutty is a retired scientist from Bhaba Atomic Research Centre. History Vellinezhi is one of the 14 desams (small duchy-like territories), and is home to Olappamanna Mana, one of the centuries-old feudal Namboothiri (Kerala Brahmin) mansions (Illam). Olappamanna, now a vacated abode that exists as a trust that lets its premises out for weddings and film/docu/teleserial shoots, was, in its heyday till the mid-20th century, the residence of luminaries such as the late Kunjunni Nambudiripad on whom the title of Rao Bahadur was awarded by the ruling British. And more recently, it also gave birth to the renowned scholar, the late O.M.C. Narayanan Nambudiripad (who gave a Malayalam interpretration to the Rigveda), the late poet Mahakavi Subrahmanian Nambudiripad (simply Olappamanna, his pen name and ancestral home name) and author-scholar Dr O.M. Anujan. In the early 20th century, it was in Olappamanna Mana that the legendary Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon redefined the aesthetics of the Kalluvazhi tradition of Kathakali. Temples Revolving around the cultural patronage of the Olappamanna Mana and the locally famous temples like Sri * Kanthalloor kshethram and Chenginikottu Kavu, Vellinezhi has grown in stature as the homestead of a few classical Kerala art forms. Primary among them is the dance-drama, Kathakali, the technical precision and aesthetic quality of which rose to great heights during the life and times of Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon who polished and made the Kalluvazhi style of the art artfully elaborate. It is his set of disciples, along with the playback musicians, percussionists, make-up (chutti), costumes (petti) artistes that he groomed who later made Vellinezhi proud. The village, critically, has a house named Kothavil that has specialised in the craft of designing and making Kathakali costumes. Music and dance Kerala-style percussion ensembles like chenda melam, thayambaka and panchavadyam too have enriched from a flurry of artistes that Vellinezhi has produced over the years. Schools The village has a high school that included Kathakali teachers and allied tutors among its faculty. Vellinezhi has also been the chief locale for Vanaprastham, an acclaimed Malayalam feature film that has won several awards. In fact, the house of Kunjukkutan, the protagonist in the movie (played by Mohanlal), had been the residence of the late Kathakali guru Padma Shri Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair. Location The village lies about 40 km west of Palakkad town, and approximately 100 km north of Nedumbassery international airport. Demographics The heritage village of Vellinezhi is now slowly but steadily transforming to a more populous, mixed-culture locality like most pockets of Kerala. Even so, it has a dense air of Kathakali and traditional arts; its people are getting less related to Kathakali and are finding new jobs. Yet, even among the growing culture of planting rubber estates, it manages to produce young artistes belonging to a traditional, ethnic art‚Äîlargely Kathakali and Kerala's percussion concerts like chenda melam and panchavadyam.

Glucose and galactose are called simple sugars, or monosaccharides. Sucrose and lactose are called disaccharides because they are made from two simple sugars, and are broken down into these simple sugars during digestion. Sucrose is broken down into glucose and another simple sugar called fructose, and lactose is broken down into glucose and galactose. As a result, lactose, sucrose and other compounds made from carbohydrates cannot be digested by individuals with glucose-galactose malabsorption. Genetics The SLC5A1 gene provides instructions for producing a sodium/glucose cotransporter protein called SGLT1. This protein is found mainly in the intestinal tract and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys, where it is involved in transporting glucose and the structurally similar galactose across cell membranes. The sodium/glucose cotransporter protein is important in the functioning of intestinal epithelial cells, which are cells that line the walls of the intestine. These cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border. The sodium/glucose cotransporter protein is involved in the process of glucose uptake in the instesinal cells due to a sodium gradient across the membrane. This is a secondary active transport because the sodium gradient generated for the functioning of the sodium/calcium exchanger is created by the sodium/potassium pump which requires ATP. Sodium and water are transported across the brush border along with the sugars in this process. Mutations that prevent the sodium/glucose cotransporter protein from performing this function result in a buildup of glucose and galactose in the intestinal tract. This failure of active transport prevents the glucose and galactose from being absorbed and providing nourishment to the body. In addition, the water that normally would have been transported across the brush border with the sugar instead remains in the intestinal tract to be expelled with the stool, resulting in dehydration of the body's tissues and severe diarrhea. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. In some cases, individuals with one altered gene have reduced levels of glucose absorption capacity as measured in laboratory tests, but this has not generally been shown to have significant health effects. Diagnosis Glucose-galactose malabsorption generally becomes apparent in the first few weeks of a baby's life. Affected infants experience severe diarrhea resulting in life-threatening dehydration, increased acidity of the blood and tissues (acidosis), and weight loss when fed breast milk or regular infant formulas. However, they are able to digest fructose-based formulas that do not contain glucose or galactose. Some affected children are better able to tolerate glucose and galactose as they get older. Small amounts of glucose in the urine (mild glucosuria) may occur intermittently in this disorder. Affected individuals may also develop kidney stones or more widespread deposits of calcium within the kidneys. Glucose-galactose malabsorption is a rare disorder; only a few hundred cases have been identified worldwide. However, as many as 10 percent of the population may have a somewhat reduced capacity for glucose absorption without associated health problems. This condition may be a milder variation of glucose-galactose malabsorption.

The school's program included academics, outdoor education, and chores. Corporal punishment, in the form of hard paddlings delivered to the student's buttocks, was frequently administered at all three schools. The school, founded in 1977, is best known for the canoeing disaster on Lake Timiskaming on 11 June 1978, where 12 children and 1 volunteer died of hypothermia, after their canoes capsized. Inexperience and poor planning were blamed for the accident according to books written by James Raffan and Scott Sorenson about the disaster.\\"Deep Waters: Courage, Character and the Lake Timiskaming Canoeing Tragedy\\" by James Raffan, HarperCollins, 2002. Despite the tragedy and probable liability, none of the parents of the deceased took legal action against the school. The parents' understanding of the accident contrasts with that put forward in Raffan's book that it was simply a terrible accident and that their sons had been the beneficiaries of good education and experiences, except for the canoeing deaths, would have been considered positively. The school continued to operate for several years but suffered a fire and a serious car accident in which the headmaster, Frank Felletti, was injured and disabled. In the end, insufficient operating funds were the cause of the school's closure in 1989. In the summer of 2007, alumni from the three St. John's schools gathered for a reunion in Ontario.

Locally the building is sometimes referred to as \\"The Castle\\" or \\"D&H; Plaza\\";\\"A History of the D&H; Building, our SUNY Plaza\\" SUNY website prior to the construction of the nearby Empire State Plaza it was simply \\"The Plaza\\". The central tower of the building is thirteen stories high and is capped by an working weathervane that is a replica of Henry Hudson's Half Moon. The State University of New York system is centrally administered from the building. The southern tower's four top floors were once the official residence of the Chancellor of SUNY. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 under the name Delaware and Hudson Railroad Company Building. In 1980, when the Downtown Albany Historic District was listed on the Register, it was included as a contributing property. History State Street looking east as it did prior to the Plaza Broadway looking south, the Plaza would soon be on the left The building and the land it sits on, which is located at the foot of State Street along Broadway, have a varied history. The oldest part of the city, it was here that several of Albany's earliest city halls sat, along with the New York State Legislature in the 18th century. The Albany Plan of Union in 1754, presided over by Ben Franklin, was held here. The land was once along the Hudson River's banks, over time being infilled, including in 1911 as part of the construction of the Plaza. The city of Albany purchased and consolidated the land ownership that allowed the D&H; to build the building and the city to have a park in front surrounded by a street that acted as a loop for the trolleys running on State Street. Public access was allowed to the Hudson River through the central tower and by way of a tunnel to the other side of the D&H; tracks. The design by Marcus T. Reynolds was based on the Nieuwerk annex of the Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium. Reynolds originally envisioned for the site a triangular park at the termination of State Street with a large L-shaped pier that would go north for three city blocks that would also support another park with a bandshell and docks for yachts and boats. That design would have cost $1 million and was opposed by neighborhood groups as too expensive and grand a design' concerns were also expressed about the problems of railroad traffic. The idea of opening up the view of the waterfront to the public was considered unfeasible and undesirable at the time, as the river was full of commercial docks, wharves, warehouses, and railroads. A plan initiated by the Albany Chamber of Commerce - later published under the title Studies for Albany - decided upon a public park as a plaza surrounded by buildings that would screen the locomotive smoke, obnoxious odors and sights of the working waterfront from the vista of State Street. The building was the corporate headquarters for the D&H; Railroad. It was constructed in sections between 1914 and 1918. The central section, including the five-story block at the north end and the thirteen-story tower, connected by the long five-story diagonal wing, was built in 1914-15. Another five-story wing south of the central tower was constructed in 1915-1918; in 1916-1918 another separate but architecturally compatible and physically connected building was constructed to be the headquarters of the Albany Evening Journal newspaper. Another section, a warehouse at the north end, was later demolished. An early rendering for the Plaza William Barnes, editor of the Evening Journal, and the Republican boss of Albany had a lavish apartment on the upper floors of his newspaper's building at the south end of the complex. In 1924 the paper was sold to the Albany Times Union and the building became home to various other businesses including the predecessor to the New York State Department of Transportation. After the D&H; and Evening Journal both abandoned the building it sat dormant until November 1972, when the State University of New York (SUNY) announced it would purchase the building as its first permanent home, having occupied One Commerce Plaza as a temporary headquarters since March of that year. SUNY purchased the building in 1973 and interior renovation and construction began that year; they relocated there in 1978. That same year SUNY Chancellor Clifton R. Wharton Jr. decided that the southern tower would house the chancellor's apartment. The total renovation of the Plaza cost $15 million. In 1977 the neighboring Federal Building was purchased and connected to the main building, becoming part of SUNY Plaza. William Hall Associates won the top Owens Corning Energy Conservation Award in the government category for their work in the renovation. The building's facade was restored from 1996 to 2001; it was covered in scaffolding during the five years of the restoration.\\"Caution at comptroller's building\\". Albany Times Union. July 27, 2009. Architecture From north to south the building consisted of at least six sections. When first built the building had an undecorated warehouse directly behind the old Federal Building built of reinforced concrete. South of where the warehouse stood begins the current structure, beginning with a square tower with four corner turrets. A 5-story tall \\"arm\\" diagonally connects the north tower with the 13-story tall central tower. Those sections were built first, in 1914-5. The building was too small for all the D&H; employees and so another \\"arm\\" was built south of the tower terminating at another square tower with corner turrets to house the offices of the Albany Evening Journal. When finally finished in 1918 the building was long. Today, without the warehouse, the Plaza is long and wide. The Plaza has approximately of office space, with the former Federal Building providing an additional . Though the building is in the Gothic architectural style the building sports several touches that tie the building into the Dutch heritage of Albany. The central tower sports an weathervane that is in the shape of Henry Hudson's ship the Half Moon while the gables of the entire building bear the coat-of-arms of prominent Dutch families including that of Albany's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler. Other non-gothic elements include the names and dates of prominent printers on the Albany Evening Journal building, including William Caxton 1487, the father of English printing. The building serves as the terminating vista of State Street. Gallery File:Halfmoonweathervanesketch.jpgMarcus T.

It is the first described disorder of creatine metabolism, and results from deficient activity of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of creatine. Clinically, affected individuals often present with hypotonia, seizures and developmental delay. Diagnosis can be suspected on clinical findings, and confirmed by specific biochemical tests, brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or genetic testing. Biallelic pathogenic variants in GAMT are the underlying cause of the disorder. After GAMT deficiency is diagnosed, it can be treated by dietary adjustments, including supplementation with creatine. Treatment is highly effective if started early in life. If treatment is started late, it cannot reverse brain damage which has already taken place. Signs and symptoms Individuals with GAMT deficiency appear normal at birth. Shortly after birth, infants may start to show signs, as the consequences of decreased creatine levels in their body become more apparent. These clinical findings are relatively non-specific, and do not immediately suggest a disorder of creatine metabolism. Common clinical findings, as with other cerebral creatine deficiencies, include developmental delay (both intellectual and motor), seizures and hypotonia. Speech delay, autism, and self-injurious behaviour have also been described. Genetics GAMT (EC 2.1.1.2) catalyzes the second step in the creatine biosynthetic pathwayBiallelic pathogenic variants in GAMT are associated with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency. This gene codes for the enzyme guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), which participates in the two-step synthesis of the compound creatine from amino acids glycine, arginine and methionine. Specifically, GAMT controls the second step of the sequence, in which creatine is produced from another compound called guanidinoacetate. The effects of GAMT deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy, such as the brain and muscles. This disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means the causative gene is located on an autosome, and two defective copies of the gene - one from each parent - are required to inherit the disorder. The parents both carry one pathogenic variant, however they are not affected by the disorder. As carriers, the residual activity of approximately 50% is enough to avoid clinical complications. Unaffected siblings of an affected individual have a 2/3 chance of being carriers. Diagnosis GAMT deficiency can be suspected from clinical findings, although clinical findings are not suggestive of a specific diagnosis. Laboratory testing of plasma and urine will show decreased levels of creatine and increased levels of guanidinoacetate. Non-specific elevations of metabolites on urine testing, such as organic acid analysis, that are normalized to creatinine may be observed. For these tests, the excretion of urine metabolites is not elevated, but appears elevated due to unusually low creatinine values. Specific diagnostic testing for GAMT deficiency relies on the measurement of guanidinoacetate and creatine in urine and plasma. Increased levels of guanidinoacetate and decreased levels of creatine can suggest a diagnosis. Confirmatory testing can include enzyme assays to directly measure guanidinoacetate methyltransferase activity or molecular testing of GAMT. Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy will show decreased levels of creatine, in affected individuals, however this finding is seen in all three cerebral creatine deficiencies, and needs to be followed up to identify the specific defect. Treatment is most effective for GAMT deficiency with early diagnosis, however the non-specific clinical findings mean there is often a delay in diagnosis. Due to the efficacy of treatment and the delay in diagnosis, GAMT deficiency has been a candidate for newborn screening programs. Newborn screening assays measure the amount of guanidinoacetate in a dried blood spot using tandem mass spectrometry. Abnormal results from a newborn screening test still need to be confirmed by testing in plasma or urine. GAMT deficiency was nominated to be included in the list of disorders recommended for screening in the United States in 2016. It was not recommended for inclusion, as studies completed at the time could not demonstrate that a case could be reliably identified in a newborn screening setting. Utah started screening for GAMT deficiency in all newborns in 2015. New York started screening newborns in late 2018, and Michigan planned to start in 2019. Treatment Treatment of GAMT deficiency focuses on restoration of depleted brain creatine with creatine supplementation in pharmacologic doses, and removal of toxic intermediates via ornithine supplementation. All patients are reported to benefit by this treatment, with improvements in muscular hypotonia, dyskinesia, social contact, alertness and behavior. Seizures appear to reduce more with dietary arginine restriction and ornithine supplementation. Despite treatment, none of the patients have been reported to return to completely normal developmental level, if significant damage had taken place before treatment. Prior to the addition of GAMT deficiency to newborn screening panels, younger siblings of affected individuals may have been tested at birth and treated early. This early treatment can result in outcomes that are very close to normal. ReferencesFurther reading * National Library of Medicine.

Commonly affected tissues include the brain and muscles. There are three distinct CCDs. The most common is creatine transporter defect (CTD), an X-linked disorder caused by pathogenic variants in SLC6A8. The main symptoms of CTD are intellectual disability and developmental delay, and these are caused by a lack of creatine in the brain, due to the defective transporter. There are also two enzymatic defects of creatine biosynthesis, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency (AGAT deficiency), caused by variants in GATM and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT deficiency), caused by variants in GAMT. The single enzyme defects are both inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Creatine is synthesized in the kidney and liver, by a two step enzymatic process. In the first step, glycine and arginine are combined by arginine:glycine amidinotransferase to form guanidinoacetate. This step also results in the production of ornithine. Creatine is produced by the enzyme guanidinoacetate methyltransferase. After production in the liver and kidneys, creatine is transported to organs and tissues with high energy demands, most commonly the brain and skeletal muscles. In addition to endogenous production, creatine can be obtained from dietary sources or supplementation. Ornithine aminotransferase deficiency can cause secondary creatine deficiency, however it does not result in cerebral creatine deficiency. __TOC__ Signs and symptoms The clinical findings in all three CCDs result from the consequences of decreased levels of creatine in tissues where it is required. In affected individuals with all three disorders, there is an almost complete absence of creatine and phosphocreatine in the brain. The two tissues with the highest demands for creatine are the brain and skeletal muscles. Muscular findings usually include weakness and decreased endurance. Other clinical findings include seizures, intellectual disability and developmental delay. Most affected individuals appear normal at birth, with clinical findings becoming apparent during the first year of life, and progressing. Pathogenesis Creatine is synthesized primarily in the liver and kidneys via a two-step enzymatic process. Defects in either of these two enzymes can cause a CCD. In order to pass the blood brain barrier, creatine requires a specialized transporter, encoded for by SLC6A8. A defect in this transporter is responsible for the third CCD.

The boy skids and lands in the water. Jimmy sees his chance to prove himself and dives in to rescue him. The boy, a Pakistani Boy Scout, thanks him and they become friends. Jimmy practices \\"flying\\" by jumping off a plank, and is seen to hover unnaturally long, as if achieving his aim. His dad discovers the new pair of friends in the bedroom one day, with Jimmy in his \\"dress\\", he is furious and smashes a trumpet Jimmy had borrowed from school for angel practice. Jimmy's grandfather sells his homing pigeons to buy Jimmy a new trumpet. Dad's illness (seemingly lung cancer) worsens and he goes into hospital. Jimmy is told that he will not return. He visits dad in hospital wearing his angel dress and plays Swing Low, Sweet Chariot on the trumpet. Disillusioned by his father's death he burns the angel dress. However Gabriel returns and explains that he has met his goal. The film ends with the famous throw on the jetty which inspired Jimmy so much. Reception Gabriel & Me received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, all three critical reviews are negative.

It shows a fixed white light that can be seen for 18 miles, by all vessels bound to New York and New Jersey Ports coming in from the Atlantic Ocean (on range only).National Lighthouse Museum - Staten Island Lighthouse The original hardware, including the second magnitude Fresnel lens and glass reflector, remain in place. However, the original mineral oil-burning lamp has since been replaced with a 1000 watt General Electric-manufactured Airway Signal incandescent lamp, with the backup light, which automatically turns on in the event of primary lamp failure, being the same. Many lighthouses have transitioned to LED systems, but this legacy equipment remains in use at this light. The Staten Island Range Light also has a second light, the Swash Channel Rear Light. This light is also a steady white light beacon, and shines continuously 24 hours a day. The Swash Channel is not a major shipping lane like the Ambrose Channel. Rather, it is akin to a \\"secondary road,\\" connecting the Ambrose Channel with the Sandy Hook Channel. This secondary light is not within the lantern room, as is the main light, the Rear Ambrose Channel Light. Both the Ambrose Channel Light, as well as the Swash Channel Light, have backup lights independent from each of the main lighting systems (and the main systems' backup lamps). Neither light blinks or rotates, and each is only visible on range. Additionally, the Staten Island Range Light may be powered by banks of on-site batteries in the event of power failure.Staten Islander News Org - Century Old Staten Island Range Lighthouse: A Tour With The U.S. Coast Guard It was designated a New York City Landmark in 1968 and remains a valuable aid to navigation for ships entering the Ambrose Channel in Lower New York Bay.

Biography Born in Amityville, New York, Pagliarulo later lived in nearby Copiague, moved to Lake Worth, Florida at age seven, and graduated from Santaluces Community High School. By 1988, Pagliarulo became a store president with Domino's Pizza. Pagliarulo began his radio career in 1989 in Palm Beach County, Florida, then worked primarily in television news, serving in many roles and eventually as the main anchor at WEYI-TV in Saginaw/Flint, Michigan (1994‚Äì1996), morning and noon anchor at WWMT in Kalamazoo/Grand Rapids, Michigan (1996‚Äì1997), main anchor, managing editor and eventually news director at WLAJ in Lansing/Jackson, Michigan (1997‚Äì2002) and main anchor at WRGB in Schenectady, New York (2002‚Äì2005). During and after his time at WRGB he also served as talk show host at WHAM in Rochester, New York and WXDX (now WDTW) in Detroit, Michigan. In 2005, Pagliarulo returned to talk radio and began his daily talk show titled The Joe Pags Show that was first heard on iHeartMedia's flagship talk radio station WOAI 1200 in San Antonio, Texas as well as KPRC-Houston, KEX-Portland, KHOW-Denver, and KTLK- Minneapolis. After Andy Dean's departure from America Now in 2014, Pagliarulo's daily show was broadcast to the 130 America Now affiliates for almost a year until a full-time replacement host was selected. After the America Now fill-in period ended, Pagliarulo's show began its own syndication through Compass Media Networks, and is now heard on over 90 stations as of May 2017. His daily show is broadcast live from 6-9 PM EST and on tape delay in some of his syndicated markets. He also hosts a weekend nationally syndicated radio talk show through Premiere Networks, titled The Weekend with Joe Pags. Pagliarulo has made many appearances on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC and previously served as a long-time frequent fill-in for Glenn Beck on Beck's television and radio programs. He has won multiple broadcasting awards from the Associated Press, and his show is listed in the top 25 of Talkers Magazine's \\"Heavy Hundred\\" and by Newsmax as one of the most influential talk shows in the country. Personal life Pagliarulo and his wife Jenny live in Texas with their four daughters, one of whom, Jia, was adopted from China. In May 2011, Pagliarulo underwent surgery for testicular cancer and has since reported a complete recovery. On September 2, 2016, Pagliarulo reported that his then-16-year-old daughter, Gabriella (aka Gabby), was missing since August 31. His request for help was spread across news and social media sites including Facebook and Twitter, and she was recovered unhurt the next day in Mexico accompanied by a 29-year-old male named Christopher Lee Fretwell, who was arrested on multiple charges. Fretwell was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Pagliarulo promised on-air to assist with other missing and exploited persons, and has since made regular updates with the assistance of missing person agencies.

Genetics Hyperprolinemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Mutations in the ALDH4A1 and PRODH genes cause hyperprolinemia. Hyperprolinemia type I is caused by a mutation in the PRODH gene, which codes for the enzyme proline oxidase. This enzyme begins the process of degrading proline by starting the reaction that converts it to pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Hyperprolinemia type II is caused by a mutation in the ALDH4A1 gene, for the enzyme 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase. This enzyme helps to break down the pyrroline-5-carboxylate produced in the previous reaction, converting it to the amino acid glutamate. The conversion between proline and glutamine, and the reverse reaction controlled by different enzymes, are important factors required to maintain proper metabolism and protein production. A deficiency of either proline oxidase or pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase results in a buildup of proline in the body. A deficiency of the latter enzyme leads to higher levels of proline and a buildup of the intermediate breakdown product pyrroline-5-carboxylate, causing the signs and symptoms of hyperprolinemia type II.Hyperprolinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are heterozygous carriers, having only one copy of the altered gene, without having signs and symptoms of the disorder. In about one-third of cases of hyperprolinemia, individuals carrying one copy of an altered PRODH gene have moderately elevated levels of proline in their blood, but these levels do not cause any health problems. Individuals with one altered ALDH4A1 gene have normal levels of proline in their blood. Diagnosis=TypesHyperprolinemia type I= It is difficult to determine the prevalence of hyperprolinemia type I, as many people with the condition are asymptomatic. People with hyperprolinemia type I have proline levels in their blood between 3 and 10 times the normal level. Some individuals with type I exhibit seizures, intellectual disability, or other neurological problems. =Hyperprolinemia type II= Hyperprolinemia type II results in proline levels in the blood between 10 and 15 times higher than normal, and high levels of a related compound called pyrroline-5-carboxylate. This rare form of the disorder may appear benign at times, but often involves seizures, convulsions, and intellectual disability. Hyperprolinemia can also occur with other conditions, such as malnutrition or liver disease. In particular, individuals with conditions that cause elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood, such as lactic acidemia, are likely to have elevated proline levels, because lactic acid inhibits the breakdown of proline. Treatment Dietary restriction of protein intake. Research A 2005 study on rats suggested that hyperprolininemia causes cognitive dysfunction.

Justin Chandler of RapReviews found the album lacking with tired production, overreliance on typical hip-hop clich√©s and Chris's performance doing little to distinguish himself, saying that he \\"has plenty of time to legitimize himself as a rapper that has more to say than the shallow surface-level stuff, but for now he seems happy with just that.\\"  Track listing  ;Notes * indicates co-producer.

She is also a cartoonist for The New Yorker and a columnist for W magazine's website. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Glamour, and O, The Oprah Magazine. Personal life Marisa Marchetto was born in 1962, in New Jersey. She grew up in Roselle Park, New Jersey,Schlesinger, Toni. \\"Cancer Vixen Tells All\\", New York Observer, October 2, 2006. Accessed August 12, 2019. \\"Ms. Marchetto grew up in a split-level home in Roselle Park, N.J.\\" where she was one of four children. She currently lives in New York. Her father was a pharmacist, and her mother, Violetta, was a shoe designer. In her first drawings, Marchetto drew copies of her mother's shoe designs. She attended the Pratt Institute in New York City, where she studied painting and eventually earned a degree from New York City's School of Visual Arts. In 2004 she married former restaurant owner Silvano Marchetto. Three weeks before the wedding Marchetto was diagnosed with breast cancer. Despite her diagnosis, the wedding went as planned, and she began her treatments. She used her diagnosis of breast cancer as an inspiration for her popular graphic memoir Cancer Vixen. While undergoing chemotherapy, surgeries, and radiation treatments, she chose to refer to herself as a \\"cancer vixen\\" rather than a \\"cancer victim.\\" Marchetto drew about her life with breast cancer which eventually led to her popular graphic memoir Cancer Vixen. Career After Marchetto graduated from the Pratt Institute she went on to work as an art director at J. Walter Thompson, a major Madison Avenue agency. There she met colleague Robert Kirshenbuam. After working at J. Walter Thompson for four years, Marchetto and Kirshenbuam left and became founders of Kirshenbuam and Bond, a boutique ad agency. After a few years at the ad agency, Marchetto moved on to be a senior vice president at Young & Rubicam. While at Young & Rubicam, Marchetto began to create a comic strip titled She. The heroine in the comic strip served as her alter ego, and in 1993 the strip became a regular feature in the women's magazine Mirabella. The cartoon strip followed the heroine with her struggles of what to wear and questioning her choices in life. Marchetto took a leave of absence from her job at Young & Rubicam to work on her graphic novel, Just Who the Hell is She, Anyway? The Autobiography of She, featuring the same character \\"She\\" from the Mirabella strip. After publishing Just Who the Hell is She, Anyway? in 1994, Marchetto never returned to her job at Young & Rubicam. In the period 2000‚Äì2001, Acocella produced the semi-regular comics journalism strip The Strip for The New York Times, often on the topic of fashion. In 2006 Knopf released Marchetto's graphic memoir, Cancer Vixen: A True Story, about her 2004-2005 battle with breast cancer. Details in the memoir include her seeking cancer treatment without health insurance, which she had allowed to lapse. Cancer Vixen was one of Times top ten graphic memoirs. Cancer Vixen was first published in Glamour magazine as a six-page cartoon. In 2006 released as a graphic memoir book which depicts a woman with cancer who chooses to live her life stylishly and fiercely, despite living with an illness. Marchetto's story is considered as a notable piece of literature in the breast cancer community. Her memoir has inspired the culture of not becoming a victim to breast cancer, but rather to be a \\"vixen.\\" In 2013, HBO announced it was developing a Cancer Vixen film starring Cate Blanchett as Marisa Acocella Marchetto; as of 2020 the film is still in development. Ann Tenna, released in September 2015 by Knopf, is a New York Times best-selling graphic novel about an influential gossip columnist who has a near-fatal accident. She is brought face-to-face with her higher self, who challenges her to change her life for the better. Marchetto has said that having a life-threatening breast cancer diagnosis informed the story arc of Ann Tenna. Marchetto currently is a cartoonist for The New Yorker. Charitable work Marchetto has donated a portion of her Cancer Vixen royalties to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and is the founder of The Cancer Vixen Fund, which has funded free mammograms for uninsured women in New York City. The renamed Marisa Acocella Marchetto Foundation funds free integrative therapies and free cold capping for women to prevent hair loss from chemotherapy at the Mount Sinai Dubin Breast Center and the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Comprehensive Cancer Center. The foundation also supports a complete empowerment program that includes yoga, Chi Qong, journaling, exercise, meditation, and nutrition. The Foundation's mission is \\"No breast left behind.\\"  Bibliography  * Just Who the Hell is She, Anyway?

Individuals with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy typically do not have any symptoms at birth, but between the ages of about 6 and 18 months they begin to experience delays in acquiring new motor and intellectual skills, such as crawling or beginning to speak. Eventually they lose previously acquired skills. Cause This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene (PLA2G6) in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. Pathophysiology Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene have been identified in most individuals with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. The PLA2G6 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called an A2 phospholipase. This enzyme family is involved in metabolizing phospholipids. Phospholipid metabolism is important for many body processes, including helping to keep the cell membrane intact and functioning properly. Specifically, the A2 phospholipase produced from the PLA2G6 gene, sometimes called PLA2 group VI, helps to regulate the levels of a compound called phosphatidylcholine, which is abundant in the cell membrane. Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene impair the function of the PLA2 group VI enzyme. This impairment of enzyme function may disrupt cell membrane maintenance and contribute to the development of spheroid bodies in the nerve axons. Although it is unknown how changes in this enzyme's function lead to the signs and symptoms of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, phospholipid metabolism problems have been seen in both this disorder and a related disorder called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. These disorders, as well as the more common Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, also are associated with changes in brain iron metabolism. Researchers are studying the links between phospholipid defects, brain iron, and damage to nerve cells, but have not determined how the iron accumulation that occurs in some individuals with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy may contribute to the features of this disorder. A few individuals with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy have not been found to have mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. The genetic cause of the condition in these cases is unknown; there is evidence that at least one other gene may be involved. Mutations in the NAGA gene, resulting in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, cause an infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy known as Schindler disease. Diagnosis In some cases, signs and symptoms of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy first appear later in childhood or during the teenage years and progress more slowly. Children with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy experience progressive difficulties with movement. Generally they have muscles that are at first weak and \\"floppy\\" (hypotonic), and then gradually become very stiff (spastic). Eventually, affected children lose the ability to move independently. Lack of muscle strength causes difficulty with feeding and breathing problems that can lead to frequent infections, such as pneumonia. Seizures occur in some affected children. Rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), and vision loss due to deterioration (atrophy) of the optic nerve are characteristic of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. Hearing loss may also develop. Children with this disorder experience progressive deterioration of cognitive functions (dementia), and eventually lose awareness of their surroundings. Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy is characterized by the development of swellings called spheroid bodies in the axons, the fibers that extend from nerve cells (neurons) and transmit impulses to muscles and other neurons. A part of the brain called the cerebellum, which helps to control movements, may also be damaged. In some individuals with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, abnormal amounts of iron accumulate in a specific region of the brain called the basal ganglia. Management Currently, only palliative treatment is available: alleviation of spasticity and seizures, baclofen for relieving dystonia, physiotherapeutic treatment and measures such as gastric feeding tube or tracheostomy to prevent aspirational pneumonia.https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi- bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert;=35069 Research An open-label clinical study for long-term evaluation of efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a deuterium-enhanced polyunsaturated fatty acid RT001, which, when taken with food, can protect the neuronal cells from degeneration, started in the Summer 2018.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03570931 The loss of iPLA2-VIA, the fly homolog of PLA2G6, reduces lifespan, impairs synaptic transmission, and causes neurodegeneration. Phospholipases typically hydrolyze glycerol phospholipids, but loss of iPLA2-VIA does not affect the phospholipid composition of brain tissue but rather causes an elevation in ceramides. Reducing ceramides with drugs, including myriocin or desipramine, alleviates lysosomal stress and suppresses neurodegeneration.

He was Prefect of Nkam and Sanaga-Maritime from 1958 to 1961‚Äîa tumultuous time for those areas‚Äîand was then appointed to the government as Minister of National Education on 20 October 1961. He remained in the latter post until 1968, holding the additional portfolios of youth, sports, and culture during that period. He was also a member of the Executive Board of UNESCO from 1962 to 1968, becoming its Vice-President in 1967, and he was President of the UNESCO General Conference from 1968 to 1970. Et√©ki Mboumoua was Special Adviser to President Ahmadou Ahidjo from 1971 to 1973. Following the 1974 resignation of Nzo Ekangaki, a fellow Cameroonian, as Secretary-General of the OAU,Michael Wolfers, Politics in the Organisation of African Unity (1976), page 67. Ahidjo proposed Et√©ki Mboumoua as a candidate for that office.Africa Contemporary Record, volume 7 (1975), pages 28 and 108. At an OAU meeting in Mogadishu in June 1974, the OAU's election process became deadlocked between a candidate from Somalia and a candidate from Zambia, with neither of them able to secure a two-thirds majority; as a result, Et√©ki Mboumoua was unanimously elected as a compromise choice. After Somalia invaded Ethiopia in July 1977, the OAU attempted to mediate the situation in August, but the Somali government refused to participate, protesting the exclusion of its allies, the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF). Et√©ki Mboumoua stated that the OAU did not consider the WSLF a true liberation movement; the Somalis in turn criticised the OAU for allegedly failing to promote African liberation.David Carment, Patrick James, and Zeynep Taydas, Who Intervenes?: Ethnic Conflict and Interstate Crisis (2006), Ohio State University Press, page 93. Et√©ki Mboumoua remained Secretary-General of the OAU until 1978, when he was succeeded by Togo's Foreign Minister, Edem Kodjo.Yassin El-Ayouty and I. William Zartman, The OAU After Twenty Years (1984), page 90.Chris Cook and John Stevenson, The Routledge Companion to World History Since 1914 (2005), page 268. He served again as Special Adviser to President Ahidjo from 1978 to 1980 and then as Minister for Special Duties under the President from 1980 to 1984. Et√©ki Mboumoua retained his post after Ahidjo resigned and was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya; he was considered a close associate of Biya,Africa Research Bulletin, volume 21 (1984), page 7,303. and on 7 July 1984, Biya appointed him as Minister of Foreign Affairs. In what was viewed as a surprising decision, Biya dismissed Et√©ki Mboumoua from the government in January 1987.Africa Review, volume 12 (1988), page 58. No specific reason was given, but Et√©ki Mboumoua was accused of \\"grave fault\\".Africa Contemporary Record, volume 20 (1989), page B-163. When asked in an interview why he had dismissed Et√©ki Mboumoua, Biya replied that, as President, he had \\"absolute discretion\\" to dismiss state officials \\"without having to give explanations to anyone\\".Africa Insight, volumes 21-22 (1991), page 170. It was speculated that Et√©ki Mboumoua was dismissed because he had objected to the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Cameroon and Israel in 1986. Given Et√©ki Mboumoua's exceptional prominence, his sudden dismissal reportedly rattled the political elite. After leaving political office, Et√©ki Mboumoua moved to humanitarian work, becoming President of the Cameroon Red Cross (CRC). He also continued to engage in some diplomatic activity; in 1995, the OAU appointed him to mediate the political situation in the Comoros.\\"William Eteki Mboumoua\\", The Indian Ocean Newsletter, number 695, Africa Intelligence, 25 November 1995. At a Red Cross event in Bertoua on 3 August 2007, Et√©ki Mboumoua discussed the dire effects of illegal migration; he highlighted the role of such migration in destabilising nations and regions when it involved Africans fleeing to neighbouring African countries to escape violence in their own countries. According to Et√©ki Mboumoua, only African unity in the form of a United States of Africa could ultimately address the problem.Sebastian Chi Elvido, \\"Union africaine : Eteki Mboumoua pour les Etats-Unis d'Afrique\\", Mutations, 9 August 2007 . Speaking on 30 January 2009, he called for donations to the CRC's emergency relief fund. Et√©ki Mboumoua explained that his organisation did not receive anywhere near an adequate level of funding from the state and that aid from other sources tended to arrive too late to be properly used in an emergency situation, so the organisation had set up its emergency relief fund in 2008. He urged donations to enable the CRC to have sufficient funds available to promptly address emergency situations.Daniel Gwarbarah, \\"Cameroon Red Cross crusades for funds\\", The Post, 2 February 2009.

The title's a play on The Unsinkable Molly Brown, a Broadway musical that was made into a film the same year. The short's a Claude Cat and Marc Antony and Pussyfoot short reworked for Tom and Jerry. The gags were inspired by other shorts, such as Feline Frame-Up, Feed the Kitty, and Two's a Crowd, which were written by Maltese and directed by Jones. Plot Tom wakes up in his basket and gets Jerry, tied to the basket with string, to fetch him a glass of milk, which Tom drinks through a straw pacifier like if he was a baby, and massage him. Tom then picks Jerry up, pats him on the head for his work, and flips him back to his hole until the next time he was needed. A small package is then delivered to the house, with Tom lazily believing it to be food for him from his owner, only to get standup shocked when he heard the meow of another cat in the house. Turned out the package had a cute red and white kitten which instantly wins Jerry's heart, but Tom takes an instant disliking to her. As Jerry stares at the kitten as he is thinking \\"I love kittens!\\", Tom flips him back to his hole again. Tom deliberates on how to get rid of the kitten, because to him one cat in the house is heaven, but two cats will just be a living hell for him. When the owner leaves to get food for the kitten, Tom grabs the kitten. Jerry hears the loud cry of the kitten and becomes angry. Jerry manages to remove himself from the string and uses it as a lasso to save the kitten. Jerry traps Tom's foot before he can kick the kitten out of the window, making him release the kitten. The kitten flies through the air, but Jerry catches her in a pillow to make her land safely. Jerry pats the kitten, as she thanks the mouse by licking him. Tom, angry, chases Jerry, who carries the kitten. Tom grabs the kitten, unbeknownst to Jerry, who bumps into a table leg. Jerry catches a plate and throws it at Tom's foot, making Tom spin, and again catches the kitten. Tom spins out of the window, and Jerry locks him out of the house to prevent him from bothering the kitten again. As Jerry and the kitten nap, an extremely mad Tom bangs on the window and threatens Jerry to get rid of the kitten and him if he didn't cooperate, but Jerry ignores him and taunts him further by feeding the kitten milk from the straw pacifier. Irritated by Jerry's defiance, Tom attempts to barge through the door, but Jerry opens the door and puts a banana peel on the floor. Tom avoids it and sticks out his tongue at Jerry, but lands onto a roller skate while pushing his tongue back in his mouth, which sends him rolling into the basement. Tom then climbs back up, slides on the banana peel towards the outside, and gets stuck in a wooden garden gate. Tom tries to jump through the upper-level window since the board gives him some air, but due to the board being stuck around his waist, he gets stuck in the window and falls shut on him. Jerry quickly locks the window and rubs his hands and chuckles gleefully. Jerry has decided that for both his cruelty to the kitten and forcing him into slavery that Tom needs a good spanking. And he takes advantage of Tom's compromising situation to do just that. Next, we see the scene from outside. Jerry has tied Tom's tail up high with a string so that he has unobstructed access to Tom's behind, effectively baring his bottom. Then he picks up a paddle (twice his own size) and carefully and deliberately takes aim. Taking his time and letting Tom think about what is about to happen. We see Tom on the inside sweating as he can see out the window. Jerry then begins spanking Tom's bare bottom hard and merciless with the paddle. This happens off-screen, only Tom's expressions of pain are shown from inside. The first three swats are slow to let it sink in as Tom tries to endure the sting, followed by a flurry of swats to drive Tom to tears. Then, from outside again, we see Tom's big red mark being left on his bare behind, blinking like a red warning light, throbbing in pain from the bare butt blistering, and Tom waves a white banner to signal his surrender knowing there is nothing he can do to prevent another spanking. After his surrender, he is then forced to act as a slave for Jerry and the kitten. She happily sips milk from the pacifier straw, as if she were a baby, and Jerry receives a shoulder massage from a disgruntled Tom. Jerry then waves goodbye at the audience while the cartoon irises out.

The Congolese National Liberation Front (, FLNC) is a political party. Funded by rebels of Katangese origin, and composing of ex- members of the Katangese Gendarmerie, it was mainly active in Angola and Zaire during the 1970s. The FLNC was formed in Angola under the leadership of Nathaniel Mbumba to expel Mobutu Sese Seko, the leader of Zaire. The FLNC is best known for its two attempted invasions of Katanga Province (renamed Shaba) in Zaire in the 1977 and 1978. The incursions, which threatened Mobutu's regime, sparked two international wars, Shaba I and Shaba II, further complicating the Angolan Civil War. From 1991, the FLNC became a member of the political life of Zaire and later of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Foundation  Nathaniel Mbumba, leader of the FLNC, on a 1978 propaganda poster. The FLNC originated as the Katangese Gendarmerie, the military of the secessionist State of Katanga during the Congo Crisis. After the defeat of the Katanga Secession, many of the black Katanga troops were forced into exile in Portuguese Angola in the mid-1960s. Led by Nathaniel Mbumba, they fought for the Portuguese colonial power during the Angolan War of Independence and formed the FLNC in 1967. After the defeat of the Portuguese in 1974, they joined the victorious MPLA. The FLNC did not have any political program other than ending Mobotu's grip on Zaire. FLNC troops were said to have been trained by Cuban advisers. Shaba I 1,500 members of the FLNC invaded Shaba (new name of the Katanga) from eastern Angola on 7 March 1977. The FLNC wanted to overthrow Mobutu. They quickly captured the city of Kolwezi, Kasaji, and Mutshatsha and defeated Zairian troops without difficulty. Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance on 2 April. The French government airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa on 10 April. This troop force worked in conjunction with the Zairian Armed Forces to beat back the FNLC with air cover from Egyptian pilots flying French-built FAZ Dassault Mirage 5 fighter jets. The Egyptian-Moroccan force pushed the last of the militants, along with a number of refugees, into Angola and Zambia by April.Schraeder, Peter J.

Both the defensive player and the runner are within a few inches of touching the base. In baseball, a neighborhood play is a force play in which a fielder receiving the ball in attempting to force out a runner at second base, catches and quickly throws the ball to first base in a double play attempt without actually touching second base, or by touching second base well before catching the ball. By every rules code, such a play is not an out, because to record a force out, the fielder with the ball must actually touch a force base (or tag the forced runner) before the forced runner arrives. The neighborhood play is called differently at various levels and in various leagues in amateur baseball (such as men's amateur, college, high school, or youth leagues). Its appropriateness and necessity in amateur and even professional baseball is debated. The safety necessity of the rule is lessened by most amateur leagues' use of the force play slide rule, which requires forced-out runners to either slide directly to the base or completely avoid the fielder, but some amateur umpires still treat the neighborhood play as an out. The traditional application of the neighborhood play for an out developed because it is common for a sliding runner to collide with the fielder at second base, sometimes causing injury. On a double play attempt, the fielder must throw the ball to first base, which would generally require a step directly into the path of the incoming runner. On a close force out at second, a fielder often cannot avoid a collision while completing a throw to first base unless he stays some distance away from second base. For the sake of safety, umpires allowed fielders to score the first out of an attempted double play without actually touching second base as long as it \\"looked like\\" an out, i.e. the fielder made a clean catch, turn, and threw near second base before the runner arrived. This allowed the tradition of the take-out slide to continue while still providing a means of safety for middle infielders. Instant replay review In 2014, instant replay was added to Major League Baseball, but along with balls and strikes the neighborhood play was exempt. However, during the April 2nd game between the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates the Cubs challenged a play initially ruled a successful 4-6-3 double play. Crew chief John Hirschbeck allowed the review and it was determined that the force was missed due to a poor throw from the second baseman rather than safety concerns (and therefore not a neighborhood play) and the runner was ruled safe, allowing a run to score from third. The neighborhood play became reviewable in 2016.

The Jarrar family, while chronicling their daily lives amid the destruction, also provides descriptive analysis of the political climate that resulted from the American occupation of the country. After the fall of Baghdad in 2003, Jarrar worked as the country director of CIVIC Worldwide, the only door-to-door civilian casualties survey in Iraq since 2003. He also founded Emaar, an NGO that carried out humanitarian and reconstruction work in Baghdad and southern Iraq.  JetBlue incident  Aspect of the slogan \\"we will not be silent\\" in Arabic and English Jarrar later gained attention after an incident on August 12, 2006 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Raed had attempted to board a JetBlue flight from New York City to Oakland, California while wearing a black T-shirt with the text \\"We will not be silent\\" in English and Arabic. The shirts were produced by The Critical Voice, an anti-war group; the text was inspired by the German phrase Wir schweigen nicht (\\"We will not be silent\\"), the slogan of the White Rose, the \\"subversive\\" German antifascist anti-Nazi organization. As Jarrar himself related: : \\"So I went to the airport in the morning, and I was prevented to go to my airplane by four officers, because I was wearing this t-shirt that says 'We Will Not Be Silent' in both Arabic and English. And I was told by one of the officials that wearing a t-shirt with Arabic script in an airport now is like going to a bank with a t-shirt that reads, 'I am a robber'.\\" After a lengthy exchange with airport staff, Jarrar was persuaded to cover his T-shirt with another T-shirt bought for him by JetBlue staff from an airport gift shop. On August 13, 2007, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against JetBlue alleging illegal discrimination against Jarrar. In January 2009 JetBlue paid Jarrar $240,000 to settle the case. Nusrat Jahan Choudhury, an expert in Constitutional law at the American Civil Liberties Union who followed the trial, noted: \\"neither the TSA officials involved nor JetBlue could identify a single passenger who had supposedly been 'concerned' by Mr. Jarrar's t-shirt. Nor had they inquired whether the nature of any purported 'concern' was based on a legitimate reason or an illegitimate racial bias, perhaps grounded in the stereotyping of Mr. Jarrar as a \\"terrorist\\" simply because he is Arab and wore a shirt with Arabic script.\\"  2017  By 2017, Jarrar was Middle East and North Africa advocacy director for Amnesty International, United States. That year, he was denied entry by Israel to mourn his recently deceased father, in his father's hometown of Jenin.Why Won‚Äôt Israel Let Me Mourn My Father?, by Raed Jarrar, Nov. 23, 2017, NY Times  Political work  Raed Jarrar translated the new Iraqi Oil Law that was proposed by the Bush Administration. He also translated multiple copies of the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement signed between the two nations in 2008. Jarrar testified before the U.S. Congress in two hearings, and helped invite three Iraqi Parliamentary delegations that testified before the U.S. congress in 2007 and 2008.

The school teaches 6th-12th grade, with about 380 students attending. History The Field School was founded in 1972 by Elizabeth Ely (1924‚Äì2009). Originally housed above Regina Cleaners in the Washington, D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood, the school had 44 students. Two years later, in 1974, the school's student population had more than doubled to 97, which the school's small location could not accommodate. Field found a new home, an old house nearby, but movers were not in the budget. That spring, students, faculty, and parents carried the school's belongings, including the furniture, up the street to the new location. Field continued to grow at its new location. Field bought another house across the street, and the two houses were used for the now 220 of Field's students. In 1993, Field was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. This accreditation came with publicity and credibility for the school, but also the requirement of a new campus, according to the Association. The school began frantically raising money, and in 1998, discovered the Cafritz mansion and the of land that accompanied it. The mansion and its land was purchased for $10 million by the school. Field began construction on the new campus and began using it in 2002. The new campus included a gymnasium and playing field, firsts for Field, as well as new science labs and dedicated studio spaces for art, photography, ceramics, and, later, music. In 2004, Dale Johnson was appointed to the position of Head of School, and in 2006 Elizabeth Ely retired. In 2007, a three-year strategic plan was created by school leadership with assistance from the community as a whole. In late 2007, the school's new logo was released. The logo depicts the facade of a part of the original Cafritz mansion. At the end of the 2009-2010 school year, the Field School renovated large portions of the Cafritz mansion. In 2011, it was announced that the Field School will be adding a sixth grade to its middle school in 2012. Campus The Field School is located on the grounds of the Cafritz mansion. The campus has four buildings: *The Aude building, named for the first word of the school's motto, which contains the admissions office and other administrative offices as well as faculty offices, classrooms, an art room, the school psychologist's office, and a publications lab. *The Cafritz building, the original mansion of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz. This building contains administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, the school's library and media center, and gathering spaces, including the original Cafritz living room and the middle school lounge. The signed Steinway piano is kept tuned in the living room. *The Sapere building, named for the second word of the school's motto. This building contains faculty offices, classrooms, and science labs, as well as a 400-seat blackbox theater, gym, and batting cage. *The Wonder building, named after the school's original campus. It is home to locker rooms, a photography lab and darkroom, a ceramics studio, and a dance and yoga studio. *The Elizabeth Meeting House, named after founder Elizabeth Ely. The $19 million structure was completed in the summer of 2015. The Meeting House features lockers, a music room and recording studio, general meeting spaces, the main office, a green roof and patio, and a kitchen. *The Bridge building connects the Cafritz and Sapere buildings and consists of three rooms, two class rooms and an art room. It was completed along with the Elizabeth Meeting House in the summer of 2015.

Some Field students take school-sponsored trips to Peru, Spain, France, and other countries or participate in the pre-professional internship theater show. Some of the organizations Field students have worked for include: Bethesda Cares, D.C. Superior Court, Embassy of Sweden, Fleet Feet, Food and Friends, The Motley Fool, National Geographic, National Museum of Natural History, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Sibley Memorial Hospital, The Washington Post, WAMU 88.5 Radio, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S Senate, and the World Bank. Honors seminar Offered during the after- lunch activity period, these extra-small seminar classes meet once each week. They provide students with the chance to study a subject beyond the traditional Field curriculum. Teachers (and sometimes teachers with students) choose a subject of particular interest to them or a subject with which they have particular expertise, then design a class that emphasizes discussion. Previous Honors courses include: The History of Hip-Hop, LOST and Philosophy, Urban Planning, A Study of The Kennedy Assassination, and The History of Pirates. Honor Council The Field School employs a unique system for handling matters of academic dishonesty that differ from other area private schools. When a student plagiarizes, cheats, or in any ways infringes on the honor code, an Honor Council of students is held, which help determine the actions that need to be taken in each case of academic dishonesty. Sports Field offers cross-country, soccer, tennis, basketball, yoga, indoor and outdoor track, baseball, softball, Ultimate Frisbee, girls' volleyball, and girls' lacrosse. Various physical education courses are offered each year as well. The school employs a no-cut policy, allowing all students to participate in the sport of their choice.

It was the first in a series of schools, operated from 1958 until 2008, by an Anglican lay religious order called the Company of the Cross.  History  The school was founded in the early 1960s by Ted Byfield and Frank Wiens, who became the school's director. They started an Anglican lay order called the Company of the Cross, based on the writings of Christian apologists, such as Dorothy L. Sayers, C.S. Lewis, and G. K. Chesterton. Originally, the Company of the Cross was under the authority of the resident bishop in Winnipeg, officially called the Diocese of Rupert's Land. Ted Byfield, Frank Wiens, and over a dozen other men‚Äîmany of them from the St. John's Cathedral choir, formed a cell or group, that shared similar beliefs. They founded a lay Anglican order, affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada, which they first called the Dynevor Society, after the Dynevor Indian Hospital in Selkirk, north of Winnipeg, a property they had acquired. They believed that the education of boys in public schools was not training them to develop strong character and Christian values. They organized a boys choir at St. John's Cathedral, which first became a club, then a weekend residential school starting in 1957, and finally, in 1962, a full-time \\"traditionalist\\" Anglican private boarding schools for boys. The Company of the Cross had acquired the abandoned Dynevor Indian Hospital where they held their weekend schools. The cell officially changed their name from Dynevor to the Company of the Cross under the Manitoba Societies Act. In 1962, Byfield and five other members of the Company opened the first in a series of St. John's full-time boarding schools for boys \\"dedicated to the reassertion of Christian educational principles\\"‚ÄîSaint John's Cathedral Boys' School. The school operated intentionally on \\"traditional\\" methods. They used mathematics textbooks from pre-World War II advancing from \\"arithmetic to calculus\\" with constant testing. Ginger Byfield taught French \\"developed from French-Canadian history.\\" They watched hockey on the French channel. Byfield taught history which required that students read copiously from Thomas Costain to Francis Parkman. The Company of the Cross teachers and staff were paid $1.00 per day and provided room and board. In 1973, parents paid $1700 dollars a year tuition. Arduous row-boat trips (called \\"cutters\\"), later replaced by canoes, and snowshoeing and dog-sledding were part of the outdoor education program. The school's founders believed that boys should be pushed to what they might believe is their breaking points, and this would \\"build character\\". The school was seen by many as a way to help troubled boys, usually from 11 to 14 years of age. Its primary focus was challenging boys from every social stratum to work together in order to grow morally, physically, intellectually and spiritually in the tradition of Victorian \\"muscular Christianity\\". The 1974 National Film Board Film described the St. John's Cathedral Boy's School as the \\"most demanding outdoor school in North America.\\" Upon arrival at the school, the new boys, 13- to 15-years old, undertook a 2-week 330 mile canoe trip and in the spring there was a second longer canoe trip covering 900 miles with 55 portages. Ted Byfield wrote in 1996 that rules were enforced with a \\"flat stick across the seat of the pants\\" in the early years of the school. In the article, Byfield defended this practice as acceptable at the time. The students ran the physical plant of the school, doing all the janitorial work, cooking and serving food, cleaning kennels, making and selling processed meat products door-to-door for fundraising, and raising sled dogs. Two other schools, Saint John's School of Alberta and Saint John's School of Ontario were founded on the same ideas in later years. The school closed in the early 1990s, struggling for funds and credibility after a canoeing disaster on Lake Timiskaming where 13 people died of hypothermia.  Incidents  In the fall of 1973, the National Film Board of Canada filmed the two week canoe trip on the Red River and Lake Winnipeg, with the 13- to 15-years old boys who had just arrived at the school. It was part of CBC-TV's series, West A boy died in the 1970s while on one of the school's lengthy snowshoe hikes. In 2000, a former teacher, Kenneth Mealey, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting five students in 1982 and 1983. A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation article on his sentencing said that \\"St. John's school administrators knew about the assault allegations but chose to fire Mealey instead of calling the authorities\\".

The cartoon's title is a play-on-words of the song \\"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\\" from Naughty Marietta, though the storyline bears no resemblance. Plot The episode begins with Tom in pursuit of Jerry similar to that of race-car shifting gears. They circle the room and back to Jerry's mouse hole. Tom is moving so fast, he runs into the wall and turns into a four-legged stool. Tom attempts to cut off a 4√ó4 area of the wall with Jerry's mouse hole in it to reach the mouse, but instead, the rest of the wall falls‚Äîon him. Then 1 Jerry is being chased by Tom in another direction, and suddenly a 2nd Jerry zooms past. Tom gets confused as a 3rd, 4th, and 5th Jerry run by and then Tom stops. He is puzzled as a 6th, 7th, and 8th Jerry zoom past. Even the 9th Jerry passed onto him as he faces it. Angrily, Tom looks in the direction the other nine Jerries were running. A 10th Jerry comes from the other direction and pulls back Tom's eyelids. Tom then chases Jerry outside into the air. Jerry breaks off before falling into space, but Tom fails. He sees the streets (approximately) 50 stories below and grabs onto the drapes again, which brings him back inside but wraps him up with the drapes. Tom and Jerry then both run into free-fall. Jerry grabs a question mark and catches a pipe. Tom grabs onto an exclamation point and then twists it into a hook shape when he sees Jerry safe, but too late‚Äîhe slams into the ground shortly thereafter. As he fixes himself like a jack using his tail, Tom climbs a rain gutter, but falls and lands in a manhole and screams. Jerry discovers an air horn, which Jerry sounds behind Tom on a ledge. Tom is left chattering on a nearby pole. Next, Jerry retreats into a second rain gutter, but Tom lassos him using a fish hook and with a chuckle, gives Jerry a taste of his own medicine. To get revenge, as Tom is laughing, Jerry dreams up some knives and throws them at Tom. Tom runs to the end of the sidewalk and narrowly avoids all knives, giving Jerry a good laugh. Tom then becomes stuck in the downpipe of the second rain gutter, with his head and front legs at the bottom and his tail and hind legs at the top, while trying to chase Jerry through it. Jerry suggests using the air horn to \\"scare\\" Tom's hind legs and tail down the pipe so Tom can be free. After this, the two shake hands, and Tom kisses Jerry. After kissing him a few times, he becomes enticed by the taste of mouse, and the chase then recommences. As Tom chases Jerry around a corner, Tom's midsection is now several meters long and he makes train noises when the cartoon closes.

The regatta was inaugurated in 1987 to celebrate the 60th birthday of the King of Thailand. The event has been held every year since during the first week of December. With royal patronage, the regatta is organised by the Phuket King's Cup Regatta Organizing Committee under the auspices of the Royal Varuna Yacht Club (RVYC), in conjunction with the Yacht Racing Association of Thailand, the Royal Thai Navy (RTN), and Phuket Province. In 2016 the event will be held from 3‚Äì10 December. Origins In 1986, a number of Thailand's yachting fraternity met to discuss what they could do as a tribute to the king on the occasion of his forthcoming fifth cycle, or 60th birthday the following year, on 5 December 1987. It was decided to hold a regatta in Phuket, the first ever held in the Andaman Sea. The inaugural regatta was held in 1987. The regatta began with a mixture of keelboats, catamarans, Lasers, and even windsurfers. More recently the regatta has become a big boat event, attracting keelboats and ocean-going catamaran teams from around the world. As a fixture on the Asian yachting circuit, the regatta annually features upwards of 90 boats (record of 103 in 2007) and 2,000 sailors, ranging from the Formula One of the sea lanes, the racing class, to live-aboard ocean cruisers, multihulls, and classics.

Volvo decided to open to the plant to bypass hefty North American import tariffs on foreign goods and to capitalize on the newly signed Canadian/American Auto Pact.Hargrove, Buzz. Laying It on the Line: Driving a Hard Bargain in Challenging Times. Toronto: HarperCollins, 2009. Print. The plant was operated by Volvo Canada Limited (now Volvo Cars of Canada Corporation) in Toronto, Ontario and bridged the gap between Volvo of North America (Rockleigh, New Jersey), Volvo headquarters and the flagship Torslanda plant in Gothenburg.  Halifax- Dartmouth and Bayer's Lake operations  The first iteration of the plant was opened in June 1963 in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The premises were leased from Atlantic Sugar Refineries (now Lantic Sugar). The Halifax plant was unlike any other assembly plant Volvo was operating at the time. This was mainly due to the plant's trademark team system that assembled the entire vehicle at one station, which was extensively used later at Volvo Torslanda Assembly and then Volvo Kalmar Assembly. In 1966, annual production totaled over 3,700 cars. Volvo 122 S, 123 GT and 122 B18s were assembled in Halifax initially, the Volvo PV544 was introduced a year later. Halifax built 123 GT models like the 122 S were rebadged as \\"Canadian GT\\"s. Units produced at the plant typically came without auxiliary lights and had only one side view mirror, but came with a limited-slip differential and hazard flashers. Halifax built Canadian GTs were available in colours such as light green (91), light blue (95), and dark blue (96) and are often seen with identification codes 5145 or 5324. For three years the plant operated out of this harbourfront facility (an old sugar processing plant) located on Halifax Harbour's Eastern Passage.Chadwick, Kathleen. 40 Years: The Story of Volvo's First Forty Years in America. Rockleigh, NJ: Olle Alexson/Volvo Cars of North America, 1995. Print. On 14 April 1967, a replacement plant at Pier 9 in Halifax was opened. The project was financed by provincial Crown corporation Industrial Estates Limited, which leased the harbourfront site from the National Harbours Board, providing the Volvo plant with its own unloading space on the pier. The new plant enabled production to exceed 8,000 cars per year.Volvo Canada Ltd.

Vol. 6, No. 3 (Summer, 1980), pp. 533-541 And, in 1974, production at the plant increased to more than 12,000 vehicles a year. In 1986, Volvo Canada announced plans to construct a new plant to build the Volvo 740, which the company said required more space for assembly than the existing factory could provide. The new C$13.5-million plant, located in the Bayers Lake Industrial Park, began operating in late 1987, and achieved full production in April 1988. In 1993, the Halifax operation celebrated its 30th anniversary. To mark the occasion 940s built at the facility were affixed with a special roundel affixed to the rear quarter window. While the plant was very successful,Volvo of North America - Press Release: Northern Operations, 1973 on September 9, 1998 Volvo decided to close the Halifax plant and end its 225 jobs, citing globalization and NAFTA as two of the reasons.

It is sometimes referred to as \\"rapure pie\\" or \\"r√¢pure\\". Its name is derived from the French \\"patates r√¢p√©es\\" meaning \\"grated potatoes\\". It is a casserole-like dish traditionally formed by grating potatoes, then squeezing them through cheesecloth. This removes some of the water from the potato solids. The liquid removed is replaced by adding hot broth made from chicken, pork or seafood along with meat and onions, and layering additional grated potatoes over the top. Common meat fillings include beef, chicken, or bar clams. History It is thought that rappie pie has its origins in the Acadian Expulsion, among Acadians who lived out their exile in Massachusetts. This opportunity to meet and interact with other immigrant groups would naturally encourage a sharing of cultural recipes. It may have been German or Swiss immigrants who taught the Acadians their technique for using grated potatoes in their recipes, but whoever it was, this proved to be an important tip for those that returned to Nova Scotia when the expulsion was lifted. When they returned, they found that their fertile land had been given to New Englanders lured north by the promise of farmland. The harsh, rocky land that remained was excellent for growing potatoes, if little else, so the Acadians used them to fill out dishes made with what game was available.

PCIT is an evidence-based treatment (EBT) for young children with behavioral and emotional disorders that places emphasis on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship and changing parent-child interaction patterns. Disruptive behavior is the most common reason for referral of young children for mental health services and can vary from relatively minor infractions such as talking back to significant acts of aggression. The most commonly treated Disruptive Behavior Disorders may be classified as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) or Conduct Disorder (CD), depending on the severity of the behavior and the nature of the presenting problems. The disorders often co-occur with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It uses a unique combination of behavioral therapy, play therapy, and parent training to teach more effective discipline techniques and improve the parent‚Äìchild relationship. PCIT is typically administered once a week, with 1-hour sessions, for 10-14 sessions total and consists of two treatment phases: Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) and Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI). The CDI component focuses on improving the quality of the parent-child relationship, which will help promote changes in behavior. This sets the foundation for the PDI stage, which continues to encourage appropriate play while also focusing on a structured and consistent approach to discipline. History PCIT was derived from several theories, including attachment theory, social learning theory, and parenting styles theory. Attachment theory According to attachment theory by Ainsworth, ‚Äúsensitive and responsive parenting‚Äù during infancy and toddlerhood leads the child to develop an expectation that their needs can be met by the parent. Thus, parents who show their young children greater warmth and are more responsive and sensitive to their needs promote a sense of security that they can later apply to relationships with others. This can also help with more effective emotion regulation. Children who are referred to clinics for externalizing behaviors are more likely than non-referred children to display distress when separated from the parent and to display indicators of an insecure attachment to their parent. The Child Directed Interaction (CDI) component of the PCIT applies attachment theory through its goal to ‚Äúrestructure the parent-child relationship and provide a secure attachment for the child‚Äù. The CDI component makes use of the idea that parents can have a dramatic effect on their child's behavior, especially during the early preschool years. This is a critical period where children are more responsive to their parent's and less so to other influences such as teachers or peers. Social learning theory Social learning theory suggests that new behaviors can be learned by watching and imitating the behaviors of others.Bandura, A., & Walters, R. H. (1977). Social learning theory (Vol. 1). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-hall. Patterson (1975) further expands on this and proposes that child behavior problems are ‚Äúinadvertently established or maintained by dysfunctional parent- child interactions‚Äù.Patterson, G. R. (1975). Families: Application of social learning to family life. Champaign, IL: Research Press. There can be a ‚Äúcoercive interaction cycle‚Äù between parent and child where both try to control the behavior of the other. Behaviors such as arguing and aggression in children are reinforced by parent behaviors (e.g., withdrawal of demands), but negative parent behaviors can subsequently be reinforced by negative child behaviors. In sum, children can learn many behaviors from their parents‚Äô feedback, but this can result in negative externalizing behaviors, as well. The PDI component targets this cycle specifically by establishing consistent parenting behaviors that encourage the desired behavior in children. Parenting style theory According to Diana Baumrind‚Äôs parenting style theory (year link citation) found that the authoritative parenting style leads to the healthiest outcomes for children transitioning into adolescence. This style combines responsive and nurturing interactions with clear communication and firm discipline. The influence of this theory can be seen particularly in the PDI treatment phase where parents are taught to use direct commands to increase desired behavior, along with other positive and nurturing behaviors. Structure of the PCIT Eyberg‚Äôs original paper (1988) thoroughly describes each assessment and treatment phase of the PCIT and includes suggestions for applying the therapy. First, parents attend a training session during which the therapist explains each rule and its rationale. Each parent is also taught through one-on-one role play interactions with the therapist. Parents are also given a handout at the end of the session that summarizes the basic directions so they can review it at home. After this training session, the sessions that follow will include the child. The sessions are held in a playroom, with the child playing with one parent at a time. Meanwhile, the therapist and the other parent will be observing the play through a one-way mirror or video system. The therapist can provide immediate feedback and suggestions through a ‚Äúbug-in-ear‚Äù device or sit in the room to do the coaching. At the end of the session, the therapist discusses the child's progress, using summary sheets that parents can use to guide their interactions during practice sessions at home. These practice sessions serve as a ‚Äúhomework assignment‚Äù for parents, during which they practice the interaction with their child for five minutes a day, using homework sheets to track progress. The treatment begins with the Child-Directed Interaction phase, then is followed by the Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI) phase. Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) According to Eyberg (1988), the parent's goal during this stage is to follow the child's lead during play while being sure to follow the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Rules‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo Rules of CDI‚Äù. The child should be free to lead the activity and make their own decisions about what and how to play. By letting their children take control of the play, the parents help their child develop autonomy and independence. =Don‚Äôt rules of CDI= According to Eyberg (1988), the Don‚Äôt rules help parents step back and encourage child-led play by avoiding commands, questions, and criticisms. Commands, or instructions, would take the lead away from the child could also introduce potential disagreements into the play. Parents are also encouraged to not ask questions. This can include questions such as ‚ÄúHow about putting the toys away?‚Äù which are actually implied commands. The concern about asking questions is that they may come off as accusatory (‚ÄúWhy did you choose that toy?‚Äù) or take the conversation to an ‚Äúadult‚Äù level instead of letting the child play freely and naturally. The general idea is that questions provide little information, so they have limited usefulness in therapy. The third ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù rule is to avoid criticizing. Though criticisms can range from mild to blatant attacks on the child, criticisms in general can lead to damaging effects on the child's self-esteem. As children learn which behaviors are good or bad, they rely on what their parents say about them and believe it. Criticisms may also frustrate or anger the child and can lead to a counterattack. Taken together, criticisms are not only unproductive in therapy, but also are threats to the positive relationship that the PCIT emphasizes. =Do rules of CDI= According to Eyberg (1988), the Do rules of CDI that promote positive behavior throughout play. The first Do is to describe what the child is doing during the activity. Doing this may seem unnatural at first, but describing serves a few purposes: it allows the child to (1) lead play, (2) improve attention towards independent activities, (3) clarify the activity and encourage the child to further elaborate the play, and (4) help teach the child different concepts in a positive way. For example, the child learns through positive feedback (‚Äúyou found the red one‚Äù) instead of coercion (‚Äúfind the red one‚Äù). The second Do is imitation. Eyberg recommends that the parents ‚Äúsit close and do the same thing as the child‚Äù. The parent can add to the child's play, or do something similar, but the focus should still remain on the child's style of play. The attention that imitation can demonstrate can show the child that the parent is interested and believes what they are doing is important. Imitation may even lead to the child imitating the parent. The aim is that through the parent- child play, the child can learn cooperative play skills that they can one day use with other children. Parents are encouraged to reflect what the child says during play, the third Do of CDI. This helps parents practice listening to their child. For example, when the child says ‚ÄúThe car is fast,‚Äù the parent might say ‚ÄúYes, the car is fast‚Äù. These reflections show that the parent understands and accepts what the child is saying. Additionally, using reflective statements can improve the child's vocabulary and grammar by providing clarity to the child's thoughts. It also gives the child an opportunity to agree or disagree with the parent's understanding and elaborate if needed. Praise is the fourth Do, and is very important because it can make children feel good and increase warmth, an important goal of the CDI. Praise statements such as ‚ÄúGood job!‚Äù show the child that their creations and actions are important. This is important because children tend to believe the things parents say to them, whether they be positive or negative. The manual specifies two types of praise. ‚ÄúLabeled praise‚Äù statements specify exactly what the parent likes about their behavior. For example, saying ‚ÄúYou did a beautiful job of drawing that picture‚Äù not only teaches children that they did something the parent liked, but also teaches them what they did to earn that praise. Because PCIT can be used from ages 2 through 7, coaching takes into account the developmental differences at each age and teaches parents to be mindful of those differences. Parents are encouraged to praise and reflect all attempts of their child to verbally communicate, as speech skills are concurrently developing. Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI) According to Eyberg (1988), during the PDI component, parents continue the skills learned in the CDI, but this time they are taught new skills to lead the play. These skills include giving verbal directions and applying the appropriate consequences to the child in a fair manner that the child can understand clearly. These steps are practiced at the clinic, and parents are not encouraged to practice at home until they feel confident. Eyberg (1988) states that he first step is to give clear, direct commands for the desired behavior from the child and to avoid indirect commands, which can be too vague and confusing to the child. For example, ‚ÄúPut this red table in the house‚Äù is a direct command. However, an indirect command such as ‚ÄúWill you color the leaves green?‚Äù can be interpreted by the child as a genuine question. Another example of an indirect command is ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs clean up the toys‚Äù, which does not indicate clearly if both the parent and child will be doing the task or how much of the task the child will do themselves. Additionally, phrases that are too general, such as ‚ÄúBe good‚Äù, should be avoided, as it does not provide enough information about what exactly is expected of the child. In sum, clear statements should be used towards the child so they can understand easily without getting confused. Eyberg (1988) provides some guidelines for parents to teach parents when giving direct commands. First, the commands should be stated positively and should tell the child what to do, rather than what not to do. For example, ‚ÄúPut your hands in your lap‚Äù should be used instead of ‚ÄúStop grabbing the toys‚Äù. Secondly, the command should be one that is age- appropriate for the child. For example, telling a 2-year-old ‚ÄúTie your shoe‚Äù would be considered not age-appropriate. Lastly, the command should require only one behavior at a time. This way, children need not remember long strings of orders in a single command. The second step of PDI involves labeled praise when the child displays the desired behavior. For example, ‚ÄúI like it when you do what I tell you to do so quickly!‚Äù tells the child what specific action pleased the parent and this praise will help increase that desired behavior. The third step is to initiate time-out whenever the child is noncompliance. Eyberg states that noncompliance will be reinforced by both parental attention and when the child is able to get out of something they do not want to do. An example may be a warning followed by a three-minute time-out. Eventually, as these skills are mastered by the parent, the commands can begin to address relevant behavioral problems the child may be displaying. The approach depends on the treatment goal. For example, if the goal is to increase a certain desired behavior, the parent must break the skill down into simpler parts that can be built on through practice and labeled praise until the child masters it. Assessments=Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction System (DPICS) DPICS is an observational system originally created for conduct problem families. It uses direct observations of behaviors to assess parent-child interactions. DPICS has undergone two revisions since its first edition published in 1981. The DPICS categories serve as indicators of relationship quality, measured by verbal and physical behaviors during social interactions.Eyberg, S. M., Nelson, M. M., Duke, M., & Boggs, S. R. (2004). Manual for the Dyadic Parent- Child Interaction Coding System Third Edition. Examples of parent behavior categories are direct and indirect commands, behavior descriptions, reflective statements, praise, information descriptions, questions, and negative talk. Child behavior categories include compliance and noncompliance, physical positive and negative, yell, whine, smart talk, laugh, and destructive behavior. Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) The ECBI is a 36-item behavior scale that is used to track disruptive behaviors in children. It was constructed from data indicating the most typical problem behaviors reported by parents of conduct problem children. The measure includes two scales: Intensity and Problem. Parents report Intensity by rating how frequent each item occurs. The Problem scale asks parents ‚ÄúIs this behavioral problem for you?‚Äù to which parents respond ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù. This measure can be used for children aged 2 to 16. Applications=Behavior problems Disruptive behavior problems are the leading reason for children's referrals to mental health professionals. and PCIT was first created to target these behaviors. Results from a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of PCIT on clinic referred children with diagnoses of Oppositional Defiant Disorder indicated that compared to the waitlist control group, parents interacted more positively with their children and were more successful at gaining compliance. Additionally, parents in the treatment group reported decreased parenting stress and more control. Parents also reported significant improvements in their child's behavior following treatment. Similar results have been shown in a quasi-experimental study by Boggs and colleagues (2004) that evaluated families who completed the treatment program compared to families who dropped out of the study before completion. For those who completed treatment, parents reported positive changes 10‚Äì30 months following treatment in their child's behavior and their parenting stress. Those who dropped out of treatment early did not show significant changes. In a meta-analysis that conducted a comprehensive review of PCIT's efficacy with children diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, or CD, PCIT was found to be an ‚Äúefficacious intervention for improving externalizing behavior in children with disruptive behavior disorders‚Äù. Another meta-analysis that focused on parenting stress in addition to child behaviors as outcomes found PCIT to have a ‚Äúbeneficial impact on parents‚Äô and primary caregivers‚Äô perceptions of all outcomes examined, including child externalizing behaviors, child's temperament and self-regulatory abilities, frequency of behavior problems, the difficulty of parent-child interactions, and parent overall distress‚Äù. The treatment effects of PCIT can also be demonstrated in school settings, despite the treatment program being lab- or home-based. In a study by Funderburk and colleagues (2009), school assessments were administered at 12 months and 18 months following PCIT. At 12 months, results indicated that children in the treatment group maintained their post- treatment improvements, improving within ‚Äúnormal range of conduct problems‚Äù compared to the control group. However, though maintaining improvements with compliance, the 18-month followup indicated some declines into the range of levels before treatment. Child maltreatment Studies have examined the effectiveness of PCIT with families at risk or engaged in child maltreatment. Evidence suggests that factors such as coercive patterns of parent-child interactions, less sensitivity towards the child, and insecure child attachment can be risks for child maltreatmen.t In a randomized controlled trial composing of 12-session PCIT, mothers reported less internalizing and externalizing behaviors in children in the PCIT group. Additionally, mothers reported less stress, more positive verbalizations and maternal sensitivity. Other studies have found similar results, including a reduction of abuse risk post-treatment compared to the waitlist control. =Foster care= PCIT may also be an effective intervention for maltreated children in foster care settings. Because children with behavioral problems in foster care are more likely to have multiple foster care placements and mental health problems, the interventions that improve foster parents‚Äô skills in managing children's difficult behaviors are needed. Findings from a study comparing foster parents and their foster children to non-abusive biological parents and their children demonstrated PCIT's effectiveness in reducing child behavior problems and caregiver distress following treatment for both groups. Depression The PCIT has been adapted to treat major depressive disorder in preschool-aged children, called the PCIT-ED. The Emotional Development module (ED) was added to target emotion development impairments in very young children, specifically. Its goal is to help children regulate and understand their own emotions more effectively. The two phases of PCIT, CDI and PDI, are retained, but are shortened to six session per phase. Parents are taught skills that help their child in identifying and managing their emotions. For example, this may involve recognizing the child's ‚Äútriggers‚Äù and using relaxation techniques to calm them. Often, parents may try to stop the child's expression of negative emotion, but during ED, parents are taught to tolerate these negative emotions so their child can learn to regulate them. The pilot study of the PCIT-ED was an open trial study that examined a group of preschool children with depression, assessing symptoms before and after treatment. This study showed decreased depressive symptoms in children, and most children no longer met major depressive disorder criteria upon completion of treatment. Additionally, children improved their coping skills, prosocial behaviors, and thought processes. The first randomized controlled trial that compared PCIT-ED to psychoeducation in depressed preschoolers and their caregivers also showed significant improvement two weeks posttreatment for the PCIT-ED group in emotion development, child executive functioning, and parenting stress. Separation anxiety disorder Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder in children which is characterized by an ‚Äúexcessive fear response to real or imagined separation from a caregiver‚Äù. PCIT involves many parenting skills that are important in reducing children's anxiety, such as command training, selective attention, reinforcement, and shaping the child's behavior. Pilot study results by Pincus and colleagues (2008) evaluating the efficacy of PCIT in 10 young children with SAD showed that did not improve to nonclinical levels posttreatment, however there was improvement in the severity of SAD. Pincus and colleagues (2008) also proposed an adaptation to the PCIT that would include the Bravery-Directed Interaction (BDI) phase. The BDI phase includes a psychoeducational component for the parents about anxiety. It also includes a gradual exposure to the separation situations the child fears. This exposure is key for all anxiety disorders. The BDI focuses on establishing a sense of control in the child by giving them the freedom to choose one exposure activity a week from the ‚ÄúBravery Ladder‚Äù homework assignment, rather than having their parent choose. An initial randomized controlled trial has been conducted to evaluate the modified PCIT, comparing its efficacy to a waitlist control group. It seeks to assess the maintenance of change at 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment. Preliminary results of study show decreased severity of SAD post-treatment. Domestic and interparental violence exposure Children are at an especially high risk for externalizing and internalizing problems following interparental violence- exposure or domestic violence. Borrego and colleagues (2008) have provided rationale for the use of PCIT with domestic violence-exposed women and their children, proposing that the parent training component may be very beneficial for mothers who may have ‚Äúlow levels of confidence in their own parenting capabilities and may also have low self-esteem‚Äù. Additionally, Borrego and colleagues (2008) emphasized that because PCIT is relationship-based, it may improve the quality of the mother-child relationship, developing a secure attachment between mother and child, and may lead to a decrease in the severity of trauma symptoms experienced by both. One study by Timmer and colleagues (2010) compared the effectiveness of PCIT in reducing behavior problems in maltreated children exposed to interparental violence (IPV) and similar children with no history of IPV-exposure. Results indicated that there were decreases in behavior problems and caregivers‚Äô distress from pre- to posttreatment in both the IPV-exposed and non-exposed groups. However, there was no significant difference between variations of IPV exposure. Delivery of treatment=In-home The implementation of PCIT in the home has been examined in order to increase accessibility. Protocol was followed as closely as possible, with the exception that treatment was conducted within the home. Some modifications may be necessary in this setting. For example, the bug-in- ear (a small, wireless earpiece) was used for coaching parents could not be used. Instead, therapists were present in the same room for coaching, typically behind the caregiver, giving discrete feedback. Therapists were able to conduct DPICS observations, however these observations were coded live. The in-home administration of PCIT in a single-subject study by Ware and colleagues (2012) has yielded promising results, such as decrease in caregiver use of negative behavior and increase in use of positive behavior and praise posttreatment. PCIT has also shown to improve child outcomes as well. PCIT completers were found to have significantly lower risk of child abuse compared to noncompleters, decrease in child behavior problems, and increased child compliance posttreatment. There are certain advantages that come with in-home PCIT. For example, therapists are able to take advantage of more authentic, ‚Äúreal life‚Äù behaviors that may not be accurately captured within a laboratory or clinic setting. Additionally, in-home PCIT can combat attrition, a problem commonly faced by therapists. This approach has potential drawbacks, as well. For example, because homes vary greatly across families, it is much more difficult for therapists control, unlike a laboratory or clinic setting. It may also be more difficult to keep children within the room and within the therapist's sight, as the child has more freedom to ‚Äúescape‚Äù if needed. These problems can be avoided by deciding beforehand which room the therapy will take place and by minimizing potential distractions. Availability of resources can be an issue as well, particularly when the treatment requires use of age- appropriate toys that are typically controlled by the therapist in clinical settings. In homes, there may be limited options of activities. However, talking to the parent beforehand about what they might prefer to play with may be helpful, and the therapist can plan to bring the toys needed. Community- based PCIT implemented in the community involves administration in community settings such as in the home, mental health services agencies, or family services agencies. Few studies have examined the effectiveness of PCIT in community settings, however one implementation through community agencies has shown decreases in behavior problems, improved parent-child interactions, reduced parental stress in a four-family clinical case study posttreatment. Additionally, a study by Lanier and colleagues (2014) found PCIT to be effective for maltreatment prevention in a group of families receiving PCIT at posttreatment followup. Internet-based In an effort to increase accessibility and address obstacles of receiving treatment, especially in underserved communities, an internet-based delivery of PCIT has been proposed and tested. This method uses video conferencing, webcams, and wireless earpieces, allowing for therapists to continue to provide real-time feedback to caregivers, right from the comfort of their home. Advantages of this method include the ability to generalize findings better because families were treated in natural settings, which are the settings in which child disruptive behaviors are most likely to manifest. Availability of resources can pose as a problem when implementing this method of PCIT. Success is dependent on families owning, or being provided, microphones, ear pieces, webcams, computers, and Wi-Fi hotspots. In homes that lack Wi-Fi or have suboptimal internet connections, real-time feedback from therapists may be affected. Treatment providers may be able to provide the necessary equipment for families to borrow, however this depends heavily on the availability of grant funds. A randomized trial has been conducted with the Internet-Delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT) and has shown support for its effectiveness in treating children with disruptive behavior disorders. Parents perceived less barriers to treatment when compared to those receiving clinic- based PCIT. This study demonstrated decreases in children's symptoms and burden to parents in a randomized clinical trial compared to a waitlist control group, and to traditional in-office PCIT administration. Additionally, roughly half of the children in the study no longer met the diagnostic criteria for disruptive behavior disorder. Criticisms In addition to the time-out component, Eyberg (1988) also recommended swatting child's bottom and other physical punishment as a form of discipline, however in a study by Timmer and colleagues (2005), physical punishment was not found to be necessary and has since been removed from the PCIT protocol. Timmer (2005) further suggested that it did not add anything and suggested a more hands-off approach to parenting. Attrition rates among families receiving PCIT are an ongoing concern. In a meta-analysis by Thomas and Zimmer-Gembeck (2012), attrition rates ranged from 18 to 35% among studies that reported attrition.

She was launched on 20 July 1944 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas W. Mearns; acquired on 21 November 1944; and commissioned the next day, Commander J. A. Gillis, USNR, in command. Butte was named for counties in California, Idaho, and South Dakota. Service history Following shakedown training along the California coast, Butte embarked troops at San Diego, California, and, on 5 January 1945, got underway for the western Pacific. En route to the Philippines, Butte made stops of varying duration at Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, Saipan, Ulithi, and in the Palau Islands. She arrived at Leyte on 21 February and began five weeks of training in preparation for the amphibious assault on Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands. On 27 March, Butte set sail for Okinawa as a unit of Task Group (TG) 55.1 of the Southern Attack Force (Task Force (TF) 55) with elements of the Army's 7th Infantry Division embarked. She arrived off the objective early in the morning of 1 April ‚Äî the day the assault was launched. During the next two weeks, Butte disembarked her troops and helped to repel air attacks, both conventional and kamikaze. On one occasion, two of her crewmen suffered wounds, but the ship escaped damage. On 14 April, Butte departed the Ryukyus with Okinawa wounded embarked. The ship made brief stops at Saipan, Ulithi, and in the Palaus before arriving at Leyte on 24 April. Five days later, she returned to sea to begin making the passenger circuit among the various islands of the western Pacific. Her last port of call in the western Pacific was Eniwetok from which she took departure on 5 June. Butte made an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 11 June and then resumed her voyage to the west coast. She reached San Francisco on 18 June. On 21 June, the Butte shaped a course for Seattle, Washington. She stayed at Seattle from 23 June to 8 July. On 8 July, Butte stood out of Seattle to return to the western Pacific. She made a short visit at Eniwetok on 21 and 22 July then continued on to Ulithi where she remained from 25 July to 8 August. From Ulithi, Butte moved on to her true destination, Okinawa, and arrived there on 12 August. Three days later, hostilities ceased; and the Japanese surrendered formally on 2 September. On 5 September, Butte put to sea from Okinawa carrying occupation troops to Korea. She arrived at Jinsen, Korea, on 8 September and remained there until 13 September. The ship returned to Okinawa on 18 September towing another transport crippled by a floating mine in the East China Sea. After 11 days at Okinawa, Butte shaped a course for northern China on 26 September carrying another complement of occupation troops. She arrived at Taku, China, on 30 September and remained there until 5 October. From Taku, the ship headed for Manila in the Philippines and an eight-day liberty call. On 23 October, she laid in a course back to China. Arriving at Kowloon, near Hong Kong, on 25 October, she embarked Chinese Nationalist troops for passage to northern China where the Chinese communists were on the advance. Butte disembarked her first contingent of Chinese soldiers at Chinwangtao between 31 October and 2 November. She returned to Kowloon on 8 November and took additional Nationalist troops on board. The ship departed Kowloon on 10 November and arrived in Tsingtao on 15 November. Later that month, she embarked homeward-bound American servicemen and shaped a course for the west coast of the United States. Butte arrived in the United States on 18 December 1945 and, after repairs, was ordered to Pearl Harbor on 23 February 1946 for assignment to JTF 1. She served as a unit of the target group for \\"Operation Crossroads\\". She survived the atomic bomb tests and was retained for structural and radiation study at Kwajalein until 12 May 1948 when she was disposed of by sinking. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 May 1948. USS Butte (APA-68) earned one battle star during World War II.

Ventnor railway station was the terminus of the Isle of Wight Railway line from Ryde. History The station lay on a ledge above sea level which had to be quarried into the hill side. The station was immediately outside a long tunnel through St. Boniface Down. A lack of space meant that a turntable was used to allow steam engines to runaround their trains. In later years this was replaced by a three way switch. The various tracks merged just before the tunnel and the locomotives had to enter the tunnel during their runround manoeuvres. The station had one side platform connected to the station buildings plus one narrow island platform. Unusually, there was only one track between the side platform and the island platform. When this track was already occupied by a train, a second incoming train had to arrive at the outer face of the island platform and passengers had to pass through the train on the inner track. If this train then departed, a temporary bridge (in fact a ship's gangway, as used on the Portsmouth to Ryde ferries) had to be manually pushed across the intervening track to allow passenger access to the train on the outside of the island platform. Further away from the station buildings were goods sidings which mainly served coal merchants who operated from caves in the chalk sides of the station cutting. The station closed to all traffic in April 1966, when the line south of fell victim to the Beeching Axe. The track was lifted by 1970 and the station subsequently demolished. The site is now an industrial park with Southern Water using the tunnel to run water pipes through. This station should not be confused with Ventnor West railway station.

Its last assignment was with Military Airlift Command, assigned to Twenty- First Air Force at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee, although except for the last month of its existence it was assigned to Tactical Air Command. It was inactivated on 31 December 1974. The division was activated at Sewart in 1957. Except for a short period following its activation and two years during the Vietnam War when it had squadrons flying the Fairchild C-123 Provider, the division's operational units were equipped with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. In addition to its airlift mission, the division supervised combat crew training and developed tactics for assault airlift operations. History H-21 helicopter The 839th Air Division was first activated at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee in October 1957. The division was assigned the 314th Troop Carrier Wing and the newly activated 513th Troop Carrier Wing.Ravenstein, pp. 279‚Äì281The 513th Wing replaced the 513th Troop Carrier Group, which had been at Sewart since June 1955. Maurer, Combat Units, p. 53 The division's 839th Air Base Group served as the host organization for Sewart, providing support for all active duty Air Force units stationed there. Subordinate troop carrier units performed joint airborne training with Army forces, developed assault airlift operations, and participated in aerial demonstrations, tactical exercises, maneuvers, and joint operations. The 513d Wing flew Fairchild C-123 Providers, while the 314th was re-equipping with Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. In November 1958, the 513d Wing was inactivated, but two squadrons of Providers were not inactivated with the group, but were instead reassigned to the 314th Wing.Ravenstein, pp, 161‚Äì163 During 1958 the 839th's components airlifted forces deploying during the Lebanon crisis and Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. Six weeks after the inactivation of the 513th Wing, the 463d Troop Carrier Wing moved to Sewart from Ardmore Air Force Base, Oklahoma. The 463d was the first Air Force unit to fly the C-130, and once in place Sewart became the primary base for training on the Hercules.Ravenstein, pp. 256‚Äì258 The 839th supported forces deployed during the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in October through November 1962 and the Dominican Civil War from April 1965 to September 1966. Although the 463d Wing moved from Sewart to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia in July 1963, the C-130 training mission remained behind. What had begun modestly as an adjunct to the 463d, the 4442d School Squadron, expanded to a group and ultimately, in 1965, to a dedicated training wing, the 4442d Combat Crew Training Wing. The 4442d conducted C-130 training for all Air Force commands flying the Hercules. Because by 1968 all early model C-130A aircraft were being operated by the Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard, training on that model was transferred to the 446th Tactical Airlift Wing, a reserve unit at Ellington Air Force Base, Texas. The 4442d continued its training mission at Sewart until February 1970, when the wing was reassigned to Twelfth Air Force. One month later, the wing and C-130 crew training moved to Little Rock Air Force Base. C-123K Provider As American participation in the Vietnam War increased, the division's wings frequently deployed elements as large as squadrons to the Pacific. Finally, in January 1966, the 314th Troop Carrier Wing moved to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base (usually called \\"CCK\\") on Taipei and was reassigned. The 314th Wing did not move with all its operational squadrons, however, but assumed command of squadrons already at CCK. Preparing for the wing move, Tactical Air Command organized the Troop Carrier Wing, Provisional, 4413th in December 1965 and attached it to the division on an interim basis. Two of the 314th's squadrons, the 61st and 62d Troop Carrier Squadrons were assigned to the division and attached to the 4413th. In July 1966 the 4413th was replaced by a permanent unit, the 64th Troop Carrier Wing, and the two former 314th Wing squadrons were assigned to the new wing.Ravenstein, pp. 102‚Äì103 Three months later, in October 1966 the 313th Troop Carrier Wing, at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas was activated and assigned to the division. Hovever, while the 313th Wing was working up with the C-130 at Forbes, the 838th Air Division was moved there and the 313th Wing was reassigned to it.Ravenstein, pp. 160‚Äì161 From 1966 to 1971, the division continued to provide \\"worldwide airlift, aeromedical evacuation, and C-130 Hercules crew training.\\" The 839th also provided C-123 Provider combat crew training from September 1969 until August 1971 for both United States and Republic of Vietnam aircrews. The command was inactivated in December 1974 in conjunction with the transfer of TAC C-130 units to Military Airlift Command.See (Transfer of tactical airlift).

Biography Bradford was born in Prince William County, Virginia in 1749. He first arrived in Kentucky with a surveying party in 1775. He moved his family there in 1784 or 1785. Although he had little experience in printing or editing, he founded the Kentucky Gazette in 1787. It was the first newspaper printed in Kentucky and had no rivals within 500 miles until 1795. It remains in circulation today. He also printed the first book published in Kentucky, a compilation of the first session of the Kentucky legislature in 1792, shortly after Kentucky became the 15th state of the United States. Bradford also contributed to the founding of Transylvania University. He was chairman of the Board of Trustees of that university from 1793 until his death in 1830. Historical article series In August 1828, Bradford began a series of 66 newspaper articles that chronicled the history of Kentucky. Most of the articles concern events that occurred before 1800, with the exception of some articles about controversies at Transylvania University. The articles dealt with four main topics. The first was the warfare with Native Americans that had occurred through the 1790s. Bradford cast the settlers in a favorable light in this struggle. The second topic was the effort to secure free use of the Mississippi River and port at New Orleans from Spain. This was a valuable outlet for surplus produce during the formation of the state. Third, Bradford chronicled the series of ten conventions that led to Kentucky's separation from Virginia and admittance into the union in 1792. The articles concerning events at Transylvania University constitute the fourth topic.

It is arguably the world's richest and largest zinc-lead ore deposit.  Discovery  Chlorargyrite lining a vug in gossan at Broken Hill Charles Sturt made a pencil sketch of the area in 1884 and noted iron ore along an isolated hill. In 1866 the Mount Gipps sheep station named their paddock, which embraced the lode outcrop, Broken Hill. However, the hill was thought to be mullock. On 5 Sept. 1883, a Mount Gipps boundary rider named Charles Rasp staked a claim on the outcrop because it looked like tin oxide as described in his prospecting guide book. With six others he staked the entire outcrop. In 1884, the syndicate reorganized as the Broken Hill Mining Company. Horn silver was discovered in 1885 and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited was organized. Charles Rasp discovered the gossan or weathered sulfide outcrop of massive lead-zinc sulfides on a feature known as Broken Hill. Rasp reported finding massive galena, sphalerite, cerussite and other oxide minerals, but was most concerned with the galena, a primary source of lead. His reports, believed exaggerated at the time, of masses of lead in the desert, soon proved true and sparked a 'lead rush' similar to gold rushes.  Exploitation  Broken Hill was exploited initially by small prospectors working the gossan for easily won galena, and soon dozens of shafts were sunk. Ore was carted to South Australia by camel trains, wagons and pack mules. A major secondary source of income became apparent, with extremely high silver grades recovered, including native silver, and other rare silver minerals present in abundance. Open-pit mining of silver oxide ores was the norm from 1885 to 1898, with local smelting. From 1898 until 1915, the leadzinc-silver sulfide minerals were developed with the concentrates treated overseas. Starting in 1915, the concentrates were treated entirely in Australia. The central part of the lode was depleted by 1940 and production was concentrated in the north and south ends. Properties in the 1950s included North Broken Hill Limited, Broken Hill South Limited, The Zinc Corporation Limited, and New Broken Hill Consolidated Limited. Through 1946, 63,795,241 tons of ore have produced 8,580,226 tons of lead, 5,194,125 tons of zinc, 538,040,847 ounces of silver, and 164,658 ounces of gold. Mining has gradually moved away from the initial small prospectors, in line with the experience in all other major mineral fields, toward gradual consolidation of claims and tenure, an increase in tenure and mine size and efficiencies in operations resulting in smaller workforces. This has accelerated in the last part of the 20th century via the formation of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company - now BHP Billiton - and its exit from Broken Hill, toward only two operators at present, utilising highly efficient bulk underground mechanised mining. Broken Hill South Limited ceased operations in 1972 and its leases were acquired by Minerals Mining and Metallurgy Limited (MMM). Underground mining stopped in 1976 and open pit mining is concentrated in the Blackwood Open Cut, which commenced in 1973, and the Kintore Open Cut. Stope fill, plus remnant supergene silver and sulphide ore characterize the ore reserve. Pasminco Limited took over the leases of The Zinc Corporation, Limited, and New Broken Hill Consolidated Limited. Their main shafts included ZC, NBHC and Southern Cross. These ZC Mines Leases lie south of the MMM Mining Leases along the Broken Hill \\"line of lode\\".  Drought endangers mining operation in the 1950s  By the early 1950s the Broken Hill area had suffered a major drought of over 8 years which was close to shutting down the mining operation. Due to the acute water shortage problem, the mine owners set in motion what became at by that time the largest use of a train for a massive water lift. Over a period of several months, special tanker car trains transported over 250 million gallons of water 40 miles by train which was pumped from the Darling River near Horse Lake, west to the small Mt Gipps rail siding where the water was transferred to large storage tanks that were built for the purpose. From the Mt Gipps storage tanks the water flows down hill through a large pipe to the Stephens Creek Reservoir, Broken Hill's main water storage facility. From Stephens Reservoir the water makes another downhill journey by a large pipe to the Broken Hills mining operation.\\"Water Lift Fights Australian Drought\\" Popular Mechanics, January 1953, pp. 146-147.  Geology  According to Gustafson, \\"The Broken Hill lodes are massive lead-zinc sulphide replacement orebodies forming (before erosion) a long continuous, irregular flat, curving pencil of ore roughly 2,000-3,000 high and 300 feet thick. In longitudinal section, the deposit describes a broad arc, flat in its middle (highest) portion, and pitching downward at each end...continuously mineralized for a horizontal distance of more than 3 miles.\\" Sphalerite and galena are the main metallic minerals. The simplified geology of the Broken Hill ore body is a series of boomerang-shaped, highly sheared and disrupted ribbon-like and poddy massive sulfide lenses which outcropped in the central section (the old \\"Broken Hills\\" gossan hills) and plunge steeply north and moderately south. The Broken Hill ore body is hosted within the gneisses of the Willyama Supergroup, a mesoproterozoic sequence of sillimanite gneisses. The original sediments consisted of alternating clays, sandy clays, sands, granitic sills, gabbro sills, and pegmatite sheets. Deformation, folding, and metamorphism converted the sediments into gneiss, the granitic rocks in augen, and the gabbro into amphibolites and hornblende schists. The ore consists of massive, recrystallised sphalerite-rich, galena-sphalerite and galena-rich sulfide lenses in folded horizons, known as No. 2 Lens Formation and No.3 Lens Formation. Both have distinctive metal ratios and gangue minerals. The ore boundaries are parallel to the bedding planes. According to Gustafson, \\"There is evidence that the ore has been introduced into an old, already folded, rock and has replaced certain favourable layers of that rock, particle by particle, with large tonnages of garnet, rhodonite, fluorite, marmatite (and wurtzite), galena, and other minerals that constitute the orebodies.\\" The Potosi-Footwall Gneiss is found on both sides of the main lode. The ore often consists up to 100% lead-zinc sulfides, with little or no pyrite, chalcopyrite or gangue sulfides. The footwall to the mineralization is a psammopelite gneiss, consisting of feldspar, quartz, garnet, biotite and amphibole, with a pelite gneiss on the hanging wall. The footwall gneiss contains anomalous mineral chemistries including a rare lead-rich feldspar and manganese-rich garnet chemistries. Ore is predominantly hosted at this stratigraphic break, but much of the ore body is structurally remobilised or offset into both the hangingwall and footwall, and the geometry of the ore deposit is particularly complex on the local scale.  Genesis  The genesis of the Broken Hill ore body is of great historical importance to geologists, particularly in Australia, as it is an iconic ore body and one of the most studied in the world, with over 1,500 papers published to date. It is also of great current importance, as conceptions of the genesis of this enigmatic ore deposit and its structural and stratigraphic setting drives exploration for repetitions of the ore deposit along strike, and in finding analogues elsewhere in the world. The genesis of Broken Hill is also of interest as it is of enduring controversy and conjecture, with the jury still mostly out on the matter although consensus has been reached on several key facets of the genetic processes which resulted in Broken Hill's formation. The interpretations presented below are the most palatable middle view of a range of opinions. = SEDEX mineralisation = Broken Hill is widely considered to be a sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) deposit which has been extensively reworked and modified by metamorphism and shearing.Most authors still consider Broken Hill to be a metamorphosed variant of the Sedex family, despite a range of critical differences regarding chemistry and setting. Key evidence for this overarching theory includes the association of silver, lead and zinc, which is found in many other SEDEX deposits worldwide and the position of the bulk of mineralization at a key stratigraphic contact between psammite and psammopelite gneisses. But there is mounting evidence that the situation at Broken Hill is much more complex. The Potosi Gneiss, and the manganiferous garnet horizon, are considered key indicators of original bedding orientation (S0) and are thus key exploration targets, as there is a proven association of anomalous lead and zinc within the gneissic stratigraphy with these horizons on a regional basis. = Metamorphic overprints = The Broken Hill ore deposit is hosted within the Proterozoic gneisses of the Broken Hill Block, adjacent to the Curnamona Craton in South Australia. The terrane in which Broken Hill is hosted has undergone a series of several metamorphic deformations at amphibolite facies. This has resulted in the 'squeezing' of the lead and zinc sulfides into the current basic boomerang shape, and resulted in the separation of the ore body into zinc-rich and lead-rich lodes and domains. The lodes themselves show various structural facies, and show variable responses to shearing, though mostly in a ductile fashion. Many lodes, particularly the lead lodes, have sharp contacts with gneissic host rocks, indicating they have become structurally relocated during peak metamorphism. Similarly, it is conjectured that the current position of the zinc and lead lodes at Broken Hill may not necessarily be related to their original position along the bedding planes (S0), or vertically within the stratigraphic section. It has taken some considerable effort to 'see through' the overwhelming structural overprint of metamorphism to infer the SEDEX classification. = Metasomatism = The lower part of the Willyama Supergroup has undergone intense sodium alteration, particularly the Broken Hill Block and subdomain. This has resulted in pervasive albite alteration particularly in the Olary domain adjacent to Broken Hill. The influence of high-temperature metamorphic fluids on the ore deposit cannot be discounted, although it is considered less central to genetic factors than previous theories of hydrothermal origins for the deposits. The current consensus view is that metasomatic overprints are present as a result of the focusing of flow through the zones of weakness around the massive sulfides, which are ductile failure loci in themselves. Metasomatic effects include re-equilibrating isotopic systematics of the lead-zinc sulfides and wall-rocks, and introduction of rare elements into the sulfide bodies to form one of the most diverse mineralogical assemblages in the Earth's crust, with 1500 or more mineral species recognized at Broken Hill, including several dozen not reported elsewhere. The association of the Broken Hill line of lode with a horizon of manganiferous garnets is considered to be partly a function of a potential protolith of exhalative manganiferous chert, metamorphically upgraded to a garnetiferous gneiss, and perhaps some reconstitution of that protolith by metasomatism associated with the nearby massive sulfides.  Broken Hill type ore deposits  Spessartine garnet crystals in massive galena, Broken Hill Broken Hill is the type locality for a class of ore deposits known as Broken Hill Type, or BHT, ore deposits. This is a classification grouping of similar deposits for use in ore genesis theories and mineral exploration methodologies. The key criteria for BHT ore deposits are;More technically: # High Pb+Zn+Ag values with Pb ‚â• Zn; # Metamorphism of amphibolite to granulite facies; # Paleo- to Mesoprotoerozoic clastic metasedimentary host rocks; # Sulfides that are spatially associated with bimodal (felsic and mafic) volcanic rocks, and stratabound gahnite- and garnet-bearing rocks and iron formations; # Stacked orebodies with characteristic Pb:Zn:Ag ratios and skarn-like Fe-Mn-Ca-F gangue assemblages, and the presence of Cu, Au, Bi, As, and Sb; # Sulfur-poor assemblages. *Association with major sedimentary packages of sandstone and siltstone protoliths sequences in highly disturbed metamorphic terranes. * A Proterozoic age is considered important, as no other major SEDEX lead-zinc deposits of this style are known from the Phanerozoic or Archean. *Association with manganiferous garnets.

History Radio College of Canada (RCC) was founded in 1928 by J. C. Wilson, who had previously amassed considerable radio experience in England and the United States. At the same time he established RCC Publications, which continues to supply technical data to service technicians in Canada.RCC Institute of Technology In 1930, as reported by Toronto Globe, Rogers-Majestic Corporation and Radio College of Canada established a plan for registering radio servicemen of the entire Dominion. Examining and qualifying those who wished to become registered became RCC's role. In 1937 the College was acquired by R. Christopher Dobson. Shortly thereafter, additional and more advanced training programs were added, including courses in commercial radio operation. During this period the demand for radio operators increased sharply with the growth in aviation; consequently large classes of radio operators were trained for the Federal Department of Transport. In the 1940s Canada's contribution to the World War II effort required immediate and large-scale planning to ensure an adequate and continuing supply of well-trained technicians and operators. Training for Canada and allied governments was performed for essential services such as government departments, Merchant Marines, and, of course, the important manufacturing industry. Radio College established additional facilities and developed specialized training programs for the purpose. Several classes of women radio operators for the air stations established across the country by the Commonwealth air training scheme were trained. The students, who came from all parts of Canada, were selected by aptitude tests developed by the College. Radio College also furnished room, board, nursing and general supervision. After the war the College did extensive rehabilitation training for Canadian and United States veterans, and later for civilians under government auspices. Many Merchant Marine graduates of RCC have later requested from the college proof of their graduation and marine placement, thereby entitling them to the federal pension recently granted to World War II members of the Merchant Marine. When television started in the 1950s, the College trained factory and service personnel. The College developed a new concept in electronics education, electronic engineering technology, a high-level program designed to train \\"technologists\\" who would be equipped to assist professional engineers in matters of applied technology, thereby releasing the engineer for matters requiring more engineering expertise, a concept that exists today in most post-secondary technical institutes. RCC had a school located in Montreal on St. Denis street in the 1950s. In 1957 the Association of Professional Engineers of the Province of Ontario (APEO), now called Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO), appointed a Certification Board ‚Äî a group of professional engineers ‚Äî which included Robert Poulter, P.Eng., then President of Radio College. The board established standards for the certificates of qualified technologists and technicians, and also for the accreditation of schools offering advanced courses at the engineering technologist level. Radio College of Canada and Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (today Ryerson University) were the first schools to be awarded full accreditation. The certification and accreditation programs continue to be carried out under the authority of the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists (CCTT) and the Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists (OACETT) by the Canadian Technology Accreditation Board. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the advent of digital electronics, RCC developed the curriculum to service the new digital, computer and microprocessor-based occupations in data communications, facsimile, mobile phone, and computer technology. In the early 1990s Hartley Nichol, President since 1985, assumed full responsibility for the college, and RCC moved to its present facility, a campus on the northern outskirts of Toronto in the City of Vaughan. On its 70th anniversary in 1998 the Radio College of Canada changed its name to RCC College of Technology. On June 24, 2004, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities in Ontario, allowed RCC to grant bachelor's degrees after a successful audit by the Post- Secondary Education Quality Assessment Board (PEQAB). In 2008, RCC Institute of Technology acquired the International Academy of Design and Technology, a well-known private college, founded in 1983 as the International Academy of Merchandising and Design. The acquisition expanded RCC‚Äôs offerings, facilitating a convergence between design and technology education. The Academy of Design became part of the family of RCC Institute of Technology schools and offered programs in interior design, graphic design & interactive media, video game design & development, fashion design and fashion merchandising & marketing. In 2010, RCC Institute of Technology reopened the Toronto Film School, adding programs in film production, scriptwriting for film & TV and acting for television, film & the theatre to its offerings. In 2011, RCC Institute of Technology created a faculty for its electronics and technology program offerings called the School of Engineering Technology & Computing; a faculty created for the delivery of electronics technology programs under the RCC umbrella. In all, RCC Institute of Technology housed three different schools ‚Äì Academy of Design, School of Engineering Technology & Computing and Toronto Film School.

The route in Pennsylvania was assigned in 1984 as a continuation of NY 474, which was designated in the early 1970s as a replacement to New York State Route 74. The route itself began as the privately maintained and tolled Wattsburg and State Line Plank Road. The plank road was chartered on March 25, 1851, running from North Street in Wattsburg to the state line, where it would continue to Sherman. The plank road was set $6,250 (1851 USD) in shares to begin.  Route description  PA 474 begins at an intersection with PA 8 and PA 89 in the borough of Wattsburg.

Tanner Road intersects and terminates in New York soon after.  History  PA 474 follows the alignment of the Wattsburg and State Line Plank Road. The plank road was first chartered on March 25, 1851, when the Pennsylvania State Legislature enacted eight commissioners to start the private highway. The charter detailed that the to-be-constructed plank road was assigned to head from the intersection with North Street in the community of Wattsburg to the New York state line, where it ended near the house of J.B. Foote, a local. Following the rules set in a legislation on January 26, 1851. The plank road company, called the Wattsburg and State Line Plank Road Company, was granted 250 shares of $25 company stock (a total of $6,520 in 1851 USD). They were also given a timetable for the construction of the new highway, that if the road was not completed between 1854 and 1858, the charter would be null and void and money would be necessary to repay the state and debts of the company. The plank road itself remained one of the several public roads in Erie County, and by 1884, was still serving its purpose. PA 474 was assigned in 1984, when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation used the plank road alignment to connect Wattsburg to NY 474, which was designated about a decade prior as a replacement to the original NY 74.

Conceived by Vice President of Parades and Spectaculars, Steve Davison, and designed by Walt Disney Creative Entertainment, the show has nearly 1,200 musical water fountains and includes lights, fire, lasers, and fog, with high-definition projections on mist screens. The show is inspired by Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color anthology television series, as evidenced by the use of its eponymous theme song written by the Sherman Brothers. The process of assembling, installing, and testing the show's numerous components and equipment in Paradise Bay spanned a period of approximately 15 months. The original version of World of Color premiered on June 11, 2010 as part of the \\"Summer Nightastic!\\" promotional campaign. The entire show cost $75 million to design, manufacture and build. The show transpires at the lagoon of Paradise Bay, while the audience watches the performance at the Paradise Lagoon Amphitheater area in front of The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure attraction. Other nearby attractions such Pixar Pal-A-Round and Incredicoaster become part of the performance as they undergo various forms of lighting and projections throughout the show. The effects utilized in World of Color (water fountains, mist screens, fire, lasers, lighting, and fog) are choreographed to work in synchronicity with the featured music and image projections. In June 2018 during a refurbishment an electrical vault flooded in the center panel, causing a delay of several months. Construction and development The show's hidden control room backstage The show was first announced as part of the Disney California Adventure Park expansion in the fall of 2007, originally known as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Construction for the water show began with the draining of the lagoon on November 3, 2008. Construction on the platform began on January 5, 2009. The water was refilled in Paradise Bay in November 2009. Testing began during and after park hours in January 2010. A 25-minute video of sequences from the show was posted on YouTube by a hotel guest staying at Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel, on April 7, 2010. The first public performance was held on June 5, 2010 for the creators of the show and guests. In the week leading up to June 11, private viewings for cast members, contest winners, and a celebrity-filled World Premiere took place. Show elements Pyrotechnics are combined with colored water fountains to create the show. The show uses nearly 1,200 fountains that can shoot water up to in the air. Each fountain is equipped with an LED ring. Other water features include a -long mist screen on which images are projected (similar but smaller screens are used in Fantasmic! at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida). Isopar instruments are capable of shooting flames up to in the air. Fog and lasers are used. Projection domes emerge from the water atop telescopic masts and feature lighting effects and video projected onto the inside surface of the domes, and laser and video projections are made onto the sun icon behind Incredicoaster‚Äôs vertical loop. A 65' tall telescopic mast was installed in the lagoon to create Chernabog of Fantasia, but the tower was never used in the show and was eventually removed. The LED lights on Pixar Pal-A-Round, as well as LED lights installed on Incredicoaster, are synchronized to the show. Light trees rise from boxes bordering Pixar Pier. The light trees bordering the viewing area and the bay include speakers, bubble machines, infrared transmitters and a handful of VariLite lighting fixtures. On either side of the bay, there is an additional light tree with five Syncrolite fixtures. The viewing area, known as Paradise Lagoon Amphitheater, is situated along the northern shore of Paradise Bay, and can hold up to 4,000 spectators at full capacity. It is multi-tiered, similar to the viewing area for Fantasmic at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. It features trellises, flowers, and an interactive play fountain during the day. Hidden fountains located in the flower beds in the viewing area are incorporated into show. When World of Color Celebrate was being programmed, a large scrim shaped like Mickeys head was added to be raised to cover the face on Pixar Pal-A-Round giving the show another projection surface. On nights where winds are too strong, the scrim is not pulled up and some projections seen on the Fun Wheel head show up on Screamin's loop area instead. The fountains on the flower beds in the viewing area were replaced by smoke shooters and additional shooters were placed on the edge of the viewing area on the water. Each shooter has its own LED light ring, similar to the fountains. From the show's conception, all versions have presented footage from the Walt Disney Studios library, including films from Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm. Synopsis=World of Color Special animation sequences were created using paper animation by paper artist Megan Brain, who created many characters for the show. Mark Hammond and Dave Hamilton arranged the music, which was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and The Nashville Choir. The show begins with Dick Wesson's original introduction to Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. A quote from Walt Disney appears on the center mist screen; \\"Every child is blessed with a vivid imagination\\", and the theme song transforms into the reworked version for World of Color. As the introduction concludes, a projection of Ariel before a sunset, stretches across the mist screens. The show enters The Little Mermaid portion, with Ariel and Sebastian singing \\"Part of Your World\\" and \\"Under the Sea\\", respectively. On the last note of \\"Under the Sea\\", Crush and Squirt from Finding Nemo are seen traveling on the East Australian Current, as the water fountains begin to portray the characteristics of rough surf. As the final breaking wave clears, the scene with Marlin and Dory encountering the blue whale from the film plays out. As the duo attempt to escape, the scene transitions into the \\"Pines of Rome\\" segment from Fantasia 2000. The bay gradually transforms into an outer space environment as Eve and WALL-E from WALL-E appear and re-enact their \\"Define Dancing\\" scene. WALL-E, equipped with a fire extinguisher, sprays it throughout the lagoon, forming small clouds as a result. The clouds eventually re-create Andy's room from Toy Story, with Sheriff Woody and Buzz Lightyear appearing shortly thereafter on Andy's bed. Woody rebuffs Buzz's ability to fly, thus Buzz attempts to disprove him and Andy's room is suddenly changed into a battle between Buzz and Emperor Zurg from Toy Story 2. As the bay clears, Carl Fredrickson's house from Up briefly makes an appearance before the setting transitions into Aladdin. With the night sky recreated on the bay, Aladdin and Princess Jasmine perform \\"A Whole New World\\" together, until the Genie abruptly appears and takes control of the show by performing \\"Friend Like Me\\". Once the Genie disappears, the Spring Sprite from Fantasia 2000 transforms the bay into a lush forest, where Pocahontas appears, singing \\"Just Around the Riverbend\\". The Pocahontas segment ends with a dramatic fountain overlay set to \\"Farewell\\" from Pocahontas. After a brief pause, Heimlich from A Bug's Life arrives, informing the audience of an approaching thunderstorm. The storm rapidly intensifies into the thunderstorm scene from The Old Mill, accompanied by an unsettling instrumental version of \\"Little April Showers\\" from Bambi. As the storm dissipates, Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean emerges from the shadows and \\"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\\" is faintly heard. Suddenly, the bay turns blood-red as fountains and flames of fire are orchestrated in tandem with \\"He's a Pirate\\". Battle scenes from the Pirates of the Caribbean series are projected onto the mist screens before transcending into a sequence dominated by jets of fire. Once the Pirates of the Caribbean act concludes, the atmosphere of the show's narrative darkens and Mufasa's death scene from The Lion King unfolds erratically on the bay. After a brief moment of silence, the show enters its climax. \\"So Close\\" from Enchanted plays as touching scenes from Disney's animated films (including The Lion King, Frozen 2, Dumbo, Tangled, Lady and the Tramp, The Princess and the Frog and Beauty and the Beast) are projected. The transformation scene from Beauty and the Beast takes place, being followed by other famous moments from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty, The Princess and the Frog and Cinderella. Immediately following Cinderella, the fountains and lighting turn white and the lagoon fades into darkness. The fountains then slowly begin to regain momentum as they swirl around the lagoon, until Tinker Bell appears to enchant the bay, which suddenly blossoms into a myriad of colors. Entering the show's finale, a reprisal of \\"The Wonderful World of Color\\" is heard as the bay becomes host to a kaleidoscopic montage of films, some of which were earlier components of the show (including Alice in Wonderland, The Little Mermaid, Finding Nemo, WALL-E, Toy Story, Aladdin, Fantasia 2000, Pocahontas, The Old Mill, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Lion King, Lilo & Stitch and The Princess and the Frog). Mickey Mouse then appears in his iconic \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" attire from Fantasia and the show concludes with a final series of water, fire, laser and light orchestrations. Notes: * Note 1. The Pirates of the Caribbean sequence was extended from May 20, 2011 to June 15, 2012 to promote the release of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. * Note 2. The original show had a sequence composed of the \\"Firebird Suite\\" (from Fantasia 2000), \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" (from Fantasia) and \\"Hellfire\\" (from The Hunchback of Notre Dame). It was replaced by the extended Pirates of the Caribbean sequences and has not been restored to the show since 2011. But this has been used in \\"Villains Night Out!\\" Halloween mini-parade at Hong Kong Disneyland, as Maleficent morph into a ferocious dragon, determined to claim the castle as her own and invited more villains. * Note 3. Replaced Tarzan on May 20, 2011. * Note 4. The finale was followed by an encore promoting the release of Tron: Legacy. It ran from October 29, 2010 to March 23, 2011. =Original planned version= The World of Color logo projected via laser onto a mist screen Early plans also called for a small orange fountain, named Little Squirt, that was meant to embody Walt Disney's artistic and mischievous spirit, and appear throughout the show. Instead, during the post-show, after all the other fountains turn off, the little orange fountain remains on for a couple seconds as it bows to the audience, then disappears. A video of a run- through of the show leaked onto the Internet on April 7, 2010. There had been a few changes to the show from the synopsis that had been disclosed for Disney fans in September 2009. Sequences featuring Alice in Wonderland, the Firebird, and Dr. Facilier were missing, the Pocahontas/Heimlich/Little April Showers segment was placed after \\"A Whole New World,\\" and new Hercules and Pirates of the Caribbean segments had been added. It was also rumored that Disney CEO Robert Iger wanted a more contemporary soundtrack and that the show was being reworked. Many of these changes were confirmed when a second video of a run- through leaked onto the Internet. Disney launched a website for World of Color containing interactive features, pictures of on-site testing, and videos. The theme song to \\"World of Color\\" has also been posted on the Disneyland website. Although videos of testing have been leaked online, the site shows both the extensive Alice in Wonderland and The Princess and the Frog segments of the show that were said to have been cut. The site was launched after leaked videos of testing were posted. Even more edits have been made, including extending \\"Part of Your World\\" and \\"A Whole New World\\" to include the verses, cutting \\"Go the Distance\\" in favor of \\"Friend Like Me,\\" and the return of \\"Firebird.\\" Singer-songwriter Amy Grant was going to provide lead vocals for the show's rendition of \\"The Wonderful World of Color\\" but was ultimately replaced in the studio and is not heard in the final version. ...Disney executives decided they wanted to go in a different direction vocally, \\"AmyGrant.com, Update From Jen (June 4, 2010)\\" =Encore scene additions= A closeup of the individual fountain nozzles. On October 29, 2010, previews for an encore scene promoting Tron: Legacy began, using additional projections and effects on the California Screamin' structure along with improved use of Paradise Park and Mickey's Fun Wheel lighting in a reworked trailer sequence. The scene was added to the show on November 1, 2010 and was discontinued in March 2011. On May 20, The Pirates of the Caribbean segment was expanded to include scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and was discontinued on June 15, 2012, the same day that a sequence incorporating Brave premiered. Beginning in 2011 for the Fourth of July season, from July 1 to 4, a special Independence Day preshow was added. The Independence Day preshow utilizes fireworks, which the normal show does not use, such as pyro launches from barges on Pixar Pier, atop of the Toy Story Midway Mania show building, and backstage behind California Screamin'. In addition, the patriotic music for the pre-show borrows selections from Disney's Celebrate America, the Fourth of July fireworks show that is presented at the adjacent Disneyland Park and Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom park. On November 11, Disney unveiled a holiday themed intro based on Prep & Landing for the 2011 Christmas season, and to commemorate their 1000th show. On December 3, 2011, Blizzard Entertainment held their annual Christmas party at Disney California Adventure Park and for the event a custom World of Color segment was produced featuring characters and game footage from Diablo III, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, and World of Warcraft. World of Color: Winter Dreams From November 15, 2013 to January 6, 2014, a full-length show titled World of Color: Winter Dreams debuted. Hosted by Olaf (Josh Gad), the show celebrates the winter season with several holiday-themed segments, featuring scenes from Frozen, Toy Story, Bambi, Fantasia, One Hundred and One Dalmatians, Prep and Landing, Secret of the Wings, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Melody Time, Lady and the Tramp, Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas, and various vintage Mickey Mouse shorts. The show incorporates traditional holiday-related music, including Eric Whitacre's \\"Glow\\", \\"Carol of the Bells\\", \\"Let it Snow\\", \\"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\\", \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\", \\"Believe\\", \\"Silent Night\\", \\"Thankful\\", the \\"Nutcracker Suite\\", \\"Jingle Bells\\", \\"I Have a Little Dreidel\\", \\"Feliz Navidad\\", \\"Joy to the World\\", and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\", as well as Disney songs, such as \\"I See the Light\\", \\"Let It Go\\" and \\"In Summer\\". The show features vocals by Heather Headley. In November 2014, World of Color: Winter Dreams opened with a different show than its pilot year. The pre-show segment of Glow has been removed; its music plays after the post-show segment as exit music. There is a reorganization of the Toy Story version of The Nutcracker with one song cut. Overall the show faced major rearrangement, such as additional songs from Frozen, including \\"Love Is an Open Door\\" and \\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\\". In the \\"Believe\\" segment, the old paper animation and guest made greeting cards were replaced with both new and familiar scenes from Big Hero 6, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, The Princess and the Frog, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, Brave, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and Pinocchio. The isopar flames were introduced into this show. In November 2015, two different World of Color shows were presented back-to-back: Winter Dreams was followed by World of Color: Celebrate!. \\"Love Is an Open Door\\" from Frozen was removed and the additional lights installed for World of Color ‚Äì Celebrate! on California Screamin' were incorporated into Winter Dreams. The rest of the show is the same as the show from the 2014 holiday season. The scrim made for World of Color ‚Äì Celebrate! to cover Mickey's head on Mickey's Fun Wheel is raised up before Winter Dreams but is only used for Celebrate. World of Color ‚Äì Celebrate! The Wonderful World of Walt Disney The intro of World of Color‚ÄìCelebrate! Premiering on May 22, 2015, as part of the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary celebration, the World of Color show was changed to World of Color ‚Äì Celebrate! The Wonderful World of Walt Disney. Dedicated to Walt Disney's legacy, this special edition of the show is hosted by Neil Patrick Harris and Mickey Mouse (Bret Iwan), and features music and imagery from Disney films and theme parks. Under the direction of Steve Davison, the show took nearly three years to develop. The show was returned to its original format September 6, 2016. Celebrate! contains five sections: *\\"Opening\\": Hosts Neil Patrick Harris and Mickey Mouse are introduced, accompanied by a new arrangement of the World of Color theme. Harris begins to describe Walt Disney's lifetime achievements and milestones including in the creation of Mickey, feature animation, and the conception of Disneyland.

World of Color Hurry Home (Lunar New Year Pre Show) On December 13, 2016, Disney announced that from January 20 to February 5th the World of Color will have a Lunar New Year preshow Celebration. The show featured the World of Color stage and a lot of lights on the Incredicoaster and Pixar Pal Around with some fireworks at the end. This six-minute pre-show called ‚ÄúHurry Home,‚Äù presented in water, animation and special effects on Paradise Bay. This charming story of a Little Lantern on its journey home to join its Lantern family in celebrating Lunar New Year features animated appearances by Mulan and Mushu in ‚Äúdream sequences‚Äù inspired by traditional Chinese paper cut-out style animation and a score highlighted by an original arrangement of the music created for the Grand Opening of Shanghai Disney Resort by Academy Award-winning composer Tan Dun (‚ÄúCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon‚Äù).  World of Color: Celebrate You! (one- time spectacular)  On September 15, 2016, Disney hosted a special private event to honor their Disneyland Resort employees and cast members who has served magic in the parks for 10 years - 60 years. This show was a one-time spectacular only made for that special event. The show was held in Paradise Bay at Disney California Adventure in September 15, and Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in the following months. The show featured the World of Color stage itself, and throughout the show also synchronized fireworks to it (fireworks on World of Color are mainly featured only for special events e.g. 4th of July Pre-Shows, New Years, Special Events, Private Events, etc.) The theme used for the show is: \\"Fantasy in the Sky\\" thought the show itself has a variety of songs featured in it. After the show included the Diamond Celebration Theme Music \\"Live the Magic\\" as the exit music, the ballad version was used for the exit music. World of Color: Villainous (Halloween) On September 17, 2019, during Oogie Boogie Bash Halloween Party nights, the water show had a makeover with a villain-themed show called Villainous. The story focused on a young girl named Shelley Marie who has encounters with many Disney Villains.

Personal life Mary Ellen Wood was born in Ogden, Utah, and raised in Clearfield, Utah. Her parents, Melvin G. and LaVora Wood, had both been LDS missionaries. Her mother went on a mission to California in 1915, her father served in Texas. Her father managed a canning factory, her mother hired all of the female workers. She was born fifth in a family of six daughters. In 1952, she married Stanley M. Smoot in the Salt Lake Temple. Smoot and her husband are the parents of seven children. The family lived for many years in Centerville, Utah, before moving to Kaysville, Utah. She sits on the advisory board of the West Ridge Academy. Smoot holds a Juris Doctorate from Brigham Young University (BYU), a master's degree in Management Science from Stanford University, a bachelor's degree in Political Science from Utah State University, and an associate degree in Arts and Sciences from Ricks College. LDS Church service In 1983, Smoot and her husband moved to Ohio, where he served as president of the church's Ohio Columbus Mission, and, later, of the Ohio Akron Mission. The Smoots served as the directors of church hosting for VIPs that visited Temple Square and LDS Church headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1998 she was given the Exemplary Womanhood Award by BYU. The Smoots helped fund construction of a replica of the original Brigham Young building, which burned to the ground in 1884, at This Is the Place Heritage Park in 2004. At the church's April 1997 general conference, Smoot was accepted as the Relief Society General President, with Virginia U. Jensen and Sheri L. Dew as her counselors. Smoot succeeded Elaine L. Jack, who had served since 1990. Smoot was the first president to call an unmarried woman (Dew) as a member of the Relief Society General Presidency. Smoot was succeeded in 2002 by Bonnie D. Parkin. In her role as an LDS leader, she has traveled throughout North and South America, and to a long list of countries including India, Russia, Nigeria, and Japan. The purpose of the Relief Society, according to Smoot, is to \\"make sure the needs of the women within the boundary of our congregation (members of the LDS Church) are cared for.\\" Under her leadership the Society participated in international humanitarian efforts, such as making and sending over 38,000 thousand homemade quilts to relieve the suffering of refugees fleeing the Kosovo War, families left homeless by the 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake, and elsewhere. She has been politically active in family-related causes, serving in leadership positions in the World Congress of Families, to promote Christian family values. Nevertheless, the focus of her presidency was on the helping the Relief Society's 4.4 million members share insight and inspiration with one another. Under her leadership, the Relief Society was the fastest growing women's organization in the world. The Relief Society, which had 3.9 million members when she became president in 1997, had 4.4 million by 2002. In 1999 she introduced a new mission statement for the Relief Society, the Salt Lake Tribune described it as emphasizing women's role in, \\"strengthening testimonies of Jesus Christ, seeking inspiration from the Holy Ghost, rededicating themselves to home and family, performing community service, sustaining the faith's all-male priesthood and worshiping in the church's temples.\\" Smoot is profiled in the 2011 book Women of character: Profiles of 100 prominent LDS women. In 2016, she headed a committee that produced a history of Centerville, Utah, entitled,Centerville Utah: Our American Hometown. Publications * Mary Ellen W. Smoot and Mary Ellen Edmunds (2000).

Bayerische Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Royal Bavarian Army, part of the German Army, in World War I.From the late 19th century, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866‚Äì1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies. Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous and came under Prussian control only during wartime. The division was formed on 10 September 1914 and organized over the next month.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815‚Äì1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabr√ºck, 1993), Bd. 1, p. 670. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. 6th Bavarian Reserve Division was raised and recruited from Bavaria's Ist and IIIrd Army Corps Districts. As a reserve division, it consisted mainly of recalled reservists. A considerable number of war volunteers were taken in, also. Among the latter was the division's most famous soldier, Adolf Hitler, an Austrian-born Gefreiter in the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16. Combat chronicle The division entered the war on 30 October 1914, when it entered the First Battle of Ypres, part of the so-called Race to the Sea. The division remained in Flanders thereafter, and fought in numerous actions, including the Battle of Fromelles in July 1916 and the latter phases of the Battle of the Somme in October 1916. In the Spring of 1917, the division fought in the Battle of Arras. It remained in the Flanders region until August 1917, when it was transferred to Upper Alsace for rest and then to the Chemin des Dames region. In 1918, it participated in the German Spring Offensive. In the Spring and Summer offensives and counteroffensives, it faced French and American troops in several battles, including on the Aisne and Champagne- Marne. The division returned to the Flanders region in August 1918, where it remained until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as a second class division, noting that while trained as an assault division, it was more often employed as a follow-on unit.6.Bayerische-Reserve-Division (Chronik 1915/1919)Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914‚Äì1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 138‚Äì141.

Early life Tendean was the a second child of three children of A.L. Tendean from Minahasa and Dutch-born French mother M.E. Cornet. He had an older sister, Mitzi, and younger sister, Rooswidiati. Tendean's father was a doctor and held posts in hospitals in Jakarta, Tasikmalaya, Cisarua, Magelang, and Semarang. Tendean attended elementary school in Magelang and middle school and high school in Semarang. His desire after completing grade school was to attend the National Military Academy (). However, his parents wanted him to become a doctor like his father or an engineer. The compromise was for Pierre to attend the Army's Engineering Academy () in Bandung, where he started in 1958. Military career Tendean received battlefield experience while in the academy when he was sent to West Sumatra with his fellow cadets to participate in a military operation named \\"Sapta Marga\\". At that time Tendean was a Corporal and was assigned to the Army's Corps of Engineers (). In 1962, Tendean graduated from ATEKAD and was given the rank Second Lieutenant (). His first assignment was as Platoon Commander in the 2nd Battalion of the Corps of Engineers in the 2nd Regional Military Command (Indonesian: Komandan Peleton Batalyon Zeni Tempur 2 Komando Daerah Militer II (Danton Yon Zipur 2 / Dam II) ) in Medan. The following year, Tendean received intelligence training in Bogor and was subsequently assigned to the Army Central Intelligence Service (). He was sent to the front lines during the confrontation with Malaysia known as \\"Dwikora\\", where he led a group of volunteers in several infiltrations into Malaysia performing intelligence gathering. On April 15, 1965, Tendean was promoted to First Lieutenant () and later, was assigned as a personal aide to General Abdul Haris Nasution. 30th September Movement Pierre Tendean on a 1966 Indonesia stamp In the early morning hours of October 1, 1965, troops loyal to the G30S came to Nasution's house with the intention of kidnapping him. Shots were fired awakening Tendean who was staying in the general's housing complex. He was apprehended by the troops and was mistaken for Nasution in the darkened villa. Nasution himself was able to escape in the confusion. Tendean was brought to Lubang Buaya along with six high-ranking officers of the army. He was shot to death, and his body thrown into an old well with those of the other captives. His body was among those recovered from the well just three days later. On 5 October 1965, President Sukarno named Pierre Tendean a national hero for his dedication and sacrifice to the nation. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of Captain and buried in the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery. The second youngest of the 8 who were killed in Jakarta, he was just 26 years old at the time of his murder.

The version recorded and released on DVD starred Cheryl Pepsii Riley as Sheila, LaVan Davis as Poppy, Donna Stewart as Diana, Tony Grant as Troy and Cordell Moore as Mike. The stage play was adapted into a motion picture by Lionsgate Home Entertainment which opened in theaters on October 12, 2007.  Plot  The scenes unfolds with Poppy (Lavan Davis) speaking to his late wife about the state of the cabin in which we find him, and after a premature cessation of cleaning due to his \\"being tired\\" he sits and looks through an old photo album. He speaks to his wife again recalling her skills with the children and her ability to discern issues in relationships and keep them strong. Just as he hopes that she is watching over them Diana (Donna Stewart) and Terry (Greg Stewart) arrive. After greeting Poppy they begin to help him clean, while sharing news of themselves and their marriage including her making partner at her firm. Poppy goes to collect more cleaning supplies at which point Terry tries to draw Diana to a bedroom to make love but she refuses for now wanting to spend some time with Poppy and to greet Sheila (Cheryl Pepsii Riley) when she arrives. After assuring him that she will be more than willing later he convinces her to provide him with an incentive, namely shaking it for him, during which Poppy returns. He teases them both about it revealing his strong belief that a woman's behind has caused wars and rumors of wars claiming it says so in the Bible making them both laugh. They tell him of Sheila's weight gain, some eighty pounds, and discuss other family issues until Mike (Cordell Moore) enters. Diana had previously voiced her objections to both Mike's presence and existence feeling he is an unsuitable husband for her friend and a very unlikeable man. Mike does nothing to dissuade her of this opinions as when questioned about Sheila's whereabouts answers disgustedly that she is outside bringing in the bags by herself. This shocks Poppy and Terry and infuriates Diana but before she can confront Mike about it Sheila enters with the bags. She greets everyone warmly and they greet her in return, though Poppy reveals some concern about her weight and size he does not speak on the matter, though Mike does in very rude and cruel terms embarrassing Sheila and further enraging Diana as well as prompting shock from Poppy and Terry. Sensing his wife's displeasure Terry takes Mike to a bedroom to talk with Poppy joining them to attempt to make Mike see the error of his ways. Mike expresses his disgust both with Sheila and the marriage retreat itself despite the fact that it has become a yearly tradition. He further reveals that Trina (Demetria McKinney), Sheila's best friend, an attractive single woman, is also coming and seems unusually interested in her presence. Poppy and Terry grow suspicious but while attempting to talk to Mike about it poppy accidentally informs Mike that terry had cheated on Diana three years previous. Mike, delighted, mocks Terry then demands details. Terry explains that he was in the wrong and how very much he regrets the act but Mike dismisses this. Poppy warns both of them that women always know but Mike again dismisses this. Poppy leaves and Terry entreats Mike to treat Sheila better but Mike startles him by declaring he desires a divorce from Sheila. Terry makes an impassioned please for Mike to see that he is wrong but Mike remains dubious as we return to focus on the women as they return to the stage. They chat about the state of their marriages, sex and life in general while Poppy occasionally chimes in until Trina arrives. Sheila attempts to get Diana to be nice but she refuses reacting with a harsh coldness to the single woman who after flirting with poppy prompting his return to his own room goes to speak to Mike and Terry. Diana begins to chase her but recalling a promise not to cause drama or trouble sits back down and idly mentions Terry's infidelity. Disbelieving Sheila scoffs, only to learn from Diana that it is indeed true who proceeds to tell her the details of the incident and the long path of recovery the couple had to travel to rekindle their marriage and love. Diana attempts to encourage Sheila to do the same but Sheila, already depressed and in doubt because Mike has already been caught cheating and refuses to sleep with her because, she feels, that he is disgusted by her weight gain. After expressing her depression and worry Sheila begins to doubt her ability to fix her marriage but Diana encourages her try but failing that to find her own peace in herself and not let things crush her. As they embrace Troy (Anthony Grant), another single friend arrives. he has along history of an attraction Sheila but has never acted upon it because of Mike, and has also become something of the third wheel of the group as he is known to bring less than satisfactory girlfriends to the retreat. This year however he has come alone except for his guitar which he calls Justine and with which he teases Sheila about being jealous. Embarrassed she tries to defend herself but Troy and Diana continue to tease as Mike, Terry and Trina rejoin the group. Diana, noting Trina sitting rather close to Mike, forcefully yanks her away while guiding Sheila to take her place much to the annoyance of Trina and Mike who manages not to show. Troydistracts them by pointing his guitar and everyone cries out happily wanting him to play something. Poppy teases them with the guitar for a long moment then begins to play at which point Troy and Trina begin to sing \\"I Am Glad To Be In That Number\\" joined by Poppy, Diana, Sheila, Mike and Terry. Excited by the singing, of which Sheila was the focus she attempts to draw Mike into a private conversation but he reveals annoyance breaking her passion for the singing. She gets him alone and tries to convince him to go to counseling. Mike refuses and cruelly insults forcing her to look at herself in a mirror and when she says she is his wife he replies that she is his problem. Hurt and desperate she begins to plead with him offering to do anything to save their marriage. He responds with \\"Go to Hell.\\" and walks out leaving Sheila crushed and despondent. Poppy and Troy are in Troy's room as he unpacks and Poppy catches up. Poppy blatantly asks when Troy will settle down and get married. Troy says when he finds the right woman. Poppy and Troy continue to talk about marriage and finding the right woman and Poppy encourages him to continue searching as well as teasing him about his past relationships. Sheila comes out of the bedroom trying to speak to Mike only to find Diana in the hall watching Mike and Trina sitting very close together on the couch talking privately. Diana is displeased but Sheila tries to convince her it is platonic as Trina and Mike talk about things she knows nothing about. Diana, trying not to hurt her friend, reluctantly agrees to join the two. Trina praises Mike to Sheila who attempts to sit beside Mike but he shifts his body not allowing her near him forcing her away much to Diana's displeasure. Terry calls the men to set the table for dinner leaving the women alone. Sheila tries to convince to Trina to try with Troy, but she expresses disdain and her plan to marry the right rich man as she believes troy is weak and lacking the wealth she requires. Diana mocks her then confronts her prompting Trina to respond. The men rush in to break things up and Sheila tries to speak to Diana about her behavior as behind her Trina storms out followed closely by Mike. Diana points this out to the shocked Sheila Later that day Mike and Trina return in very happy moods and when questioned by Sheila about their location Mike begins to fumble words though Trina assures her they were at the lake looking at the boats. Diana continues to express her disdain for both of them. Sheila asks if Mike is hungry, as they had sat around waiting for Mike and Trina to return rather than eating, drawing yet another insult from Mike. Poppy calls him out on it but Mike ignores him so Poppy, in response to Trina's question, tells them that they had been discussed marriage allowing Terry to distract Diana with the state of their marriage. Trina expressed her disgust with Diana and Terry as she believes marriage is fake. Yet again Diana speaks her mind leading to Trina to confront her about her behavior, claiming that she knows that Diana talks about her behind her back to Sheila, embarrassing Sheila. Diana, showing no concern for Trina or her supposed feelings attacks her in return calling her out about her affair with Mike which everyone else reacts in shock but Diana refuses to be silenced. The men back off as Diana launches in Trina who weakly objects to the accusation. Sheila, ever the true friend tries to defend her only to be yet again insulted by Mike. Sheila calls for silence and says she wishes to leave. Trina gets into Diana's face and when threatened runs to the hall while Mike prepares to pay Poppy for the weekend and Sheila miserably staggers about waiting to leave. Troy notices a fallen empty condom wrapper and seeing it Sheila calls him out on it. Poppy flees to his room while Sheila points out the state of the wrapper after Mike had tried to claim it was for him and Sheila as he wanted no more kids. Mike covers why trying to push her out the door to which Trina agrees trying to entice Sheila out of the cabin but Diana interrupts calling her out on her cowardice. She also confronts Mike who starts to express violent intent toward Diana but Terry moves between them forcing Mike to back down. Sheila asks Trina about the affair and she coldly replies that it did happen. Shocked to tears Sheila watched in horror as Mike walks past her to put his arms possessively around Trina who surveys the room proudly. Sheila retreats to Diana and Terry who help her sit, while troy moves to comfort her only for Mike to approach forcing him to move aside. Mike pulls out a set of keys explaining he has rented Sheila an apartment across town. He shocks everyone by saying that he has paid the rent for six months but after that she will be on her own, he has changed the locks to the house and instructed the gate guard not to let her in. Her children are at her mother's implying he is refusing to take them as well. He allows her to keep her vehicle, and seeming to think this wills often the blow gives her a pat on the shoulder which she flinches away from. During this Diana had found some Vaseline and had been preparing to fight but is stopped by Terry as he does not want there to be violence in addition to all of this as Sheila needs her friend now more than vengeance. Reluctantly she agrees then threatens Mike because as a lawyer she will be taking the case and she plans on destroying Mike in court. Mike attempts to assuage this clear point by offering to take Sheila to her mother's but makes it clear he will not listen to her crying or endure her tears. Trina coldly agrees that he will explain. Sheila feigns agreement moving toward Mike by stumbling past the coffee table which contains a loaded pistol. Diana, having forgotten about it in all of this tries to get terry to agree to take Sheila home instead as Sheila retrieves the pistol and points it at Mike forcing him to flee and the others to attempt to calm her. Trina flees without Mike who runs after her and is seemingly shot in the rear immediately clutching himself there as he frantically exits the cabin while Diana calls for Terry to help Sheila but he is too busy keeping Diana from getting shot by the despondent Sheila. Sheila empties the clip at Mike at which point Troy takes the gun from her and Sheila breaks down into violent sobs. Terry and troy go to check on Mike and Trina as Diana gets Sheila, still sobbing inconsolably, to sit. Sheila cries out to Mike, then to God tears still running down her face. A year later Diana and Terry are once again helping Poppy clean the cabin and discussing the changes in their circle of friends. Diana tells them of the divorce in which she had had Mike cornered and was about to take everything when Sheila had decided she did not want to and had given up on the case walking away. Mike and Trina, now married, walk in to the shock of the three. Terry offers to leaves but Diana refuses. Poppy informs Mike that he has been praying for him, clearly to Mike's discomfort. Mike tries to mend fences with Diana admitting she all but destroyed him in court but she will have none of it pointing out that she would have finished the job except for Sheila's apparent mercy which Trina dubs as weakness yet again infuriating Diana. Diana insults Trina again increasing the tension. Trina begins to flirt with Terry but at Diana's warning Terry grabs Mike and the two flee the room. Trina tries, in her own caustic egotistical way, to make friends with Diana. Diana denies her attempts informing her that her faith in Christ will allow her to overcome anything Trina can come up with but also informs her that if Trina does anything else to threaten Diana's peace she will \\"come up missing.\\" Mike is casually showing his regret for divorcing Sheila to Terry, as Trina cannot cook, will not clean up the house and seems only to shop and otherwise spend his money apparently having maxed out several of his credit cards. When Terry calls him out on this Mike begins to jokingly insult Sheila again implying that she has likely put on even more weight and even pretends to be proud of the fact that he hurt her so badly. Terry is disgusted by this and threatens to end their friendship. Mike reveals in response that he does not have the time he had anymore, not even able to see his kids, as since the divorce his business has nearly collapsed and Mike is so busy trying to make more to replace what Trina rapidly spends he has no time for anything else. Terry points out how this is wrong and Mike gets annoyed and leaves the room. Terry tries to get him to see the right path but Mike refuses to listen as the women call for them all to come to dinner. At table it is made clear that Trina did nothing to help and Mike pointedly shows her a plate and fork reminding her that they are needed to eat before Poppy begins a powerful musical prayer for the meal which Trina interrupts much to Poppy's annoyance. Dinner is a rather uncomfortable affair as Trina tries, yet again in her caustic manner, to be social but is soundly defeated by Diana in each attempt. Poppy calls for an end to it and Troy comes in and warmly greets everyone. Trina tries to flirt with him but Troy repels her firmly informing everyone he is in love. Mike, aggravated by Trina's behavior, threatens her making her return to her seat. Troy implies he brought someone for the couples retreat though he is concerned about Trina and Mike's presence. Before the woman he came with comes in he rushes off to the restroom, but not before ensuring that he and Mike are 'cool.' Once Troy is gone Diana reminds Poppy and Terry about the poor choices Troy has made in the past and implies her intent to fight. Terry reminds her of Troy and Poppy's talk the year before but she is unconvinced and seemingly for good reason as Janice (Beverly Faulks), a very powerfully built lady, enters. Janice is in denim overalls and a plaid flannel shirt and forcefully barges her way into the meal, silencing the spiteful Trina by shoving a bite of chicken into her mouth, having already thrown Mike from his chair at the table. Janice reveals she met Troy when his vehicle broke down and she brought him out to the cabin, her truck driving route being along the way. Trina disgustedly calls her a lesbian much to Diana's chagrin and Janice's anger. Janice playfully threatens her as Troy returns greeting her warmly. Janice takes her food and after smacking Trina on the butt feigning interest in her, she heads for the door taunting Trina before leaving. Poppy expresses interest in the unusual Janice prompting first Diana to approach Troy about her then Mike who uses it as an opportunity to attack Sheila yet again about her size. While in the midst of a rather biting insult the door opens revealing a much changed Sheila. Her hair is much longer now and she is in a form fitting dress revealing a shapely figure much to everyone's shock. Diana is in utter but delighted shock as is Terry and Poppy. Troy then reveals that he and Sheila are together and the two passionately kiss as the scene shifts. Mike is sitting alone when Trina returns after more shopping. Mike confronts her about it but she brushes him off until he calls her Sheila. He then says her name and goes into another comparison of the two as Sheila would never spend all that money irritating Trina. Mike pleads with her to stop spending all this money but she refuses so he then declares that the 'bank' is closed. She reacts by hinting that she has some lingerie in the bags she now plans to return but when Mike hint's she can keep that she responds that because of the 'bank' being closed everything else is now closed too. Sheila, having entered from the kitchen to hear everything, waits until Trina leaves then mocks Mike for his mistake. Mike attempts to get close but she repels him with ease and little concern. She states that she feels sorry for him being in this state and points out that he had something good in her and gave it up. She also reveals that it had been she who had carefully kept the books balanced and thus Made Mike's business so very profitable. Surprised he asked if she had done that for him but she replies that she had done it for them as a good wife should. Clearly troubled Mike tries to make amends but again Sheila repels him. Dismayed Mike scurries off as Terry and Diana come in from a walk and about to go make love when Sheila reveals her presence prompting Diana to go talk to her. Terry tries to convince her otherwise but Diana refuses saying she will be up later then heads down to speak to Sheila while Terry goes to pout and wait. Diana wants to learn how Sheila has undergone this change not only of the physical but also the mental and physical. Sheila reveals that she has become a Christian, having done so just before walking out of the trial. Prior to that Troy had offered Sheila a job and needing an income as Mike had proven to be a lackluster father she needed it for her children so she had taken the position. Troy worked closely with Sheila at his restaurant teaching her the business patiently and as time went on he challenged her to go with him to the gym and she agreed and now that she was doing it for herself and not others Sheila quickly dropped her weight delighting in the results. She then reveals that she and Troy are married again pleasantly surprising Diana. She reports that Troy is a good man, a good stepfather having gained her children's love and respect, and with God makes her happier than she ever has been before. Troy returns from a run to find Trina alone working out. Uncomfortable Troy tries to leave as Trina begins to aggressively flirt with and seduce him. He informs her he is having none it and pushes her away in full view of Sheila and Diana thus Troy proves his faithfulness without knowing. Sheila then expresses her intent to harm Trina who backs off while Troy and Diana go to the kitchen to start cooking. Sheila walks over to Trina who feigns innocence but Sheila is clearly not buying it. Sheila reminds Trina of how very good of a friend she had been having protecting Trina from violence, the streets, and even the law at separate times. Trina, unable to deny any of it begins to look uncomfortable, and tries to blow it off when Sheila forgives her. Sheila then threatens to kill her should Trina ever approach Troy again. Terry and Mike return reporting that the boat ride cannot happen because of heavy rain. Diana asks that they follow tradition and tell their 'why did i get married' stories and despite Mike's objections Terry begins. Terry and Diana share a sweet reminiscence about their reason prompting Poppy to tease he married Terry's mother for the benefits. Troy reveals he married Sheila because she was able to overcome her pain for him and she because he was everything Mike was not. Mike passes. The couples separate and Troy checks with Sheila that she is not too upset by Mike's presence as Diana is not the only one who despises Sheila's ex. He then reminds Sheila how very much he loves her. The two make love that night and the next morning everyone prepares to leave. Mike expresses his disappointment with Trina banishing her to the car. Mike seems interested in helping with his kids by offering the first payment of any kind which Sheila refuses. Sheila confronts Mike about his actions refusing Mike's attempts to restart their relationship. She sends him a way angry and as Mike passes Troy, her new husband reminds Mike that he has this and then Troy and Sheila kiss. Poppy expresses his approval of the couple. Poppy gathers Troy, Sheila, Diana, and Terry to talk to them as Mike and Trina leave without even saying goodbye. Poppy wishes them well and hopes for happiness in their lives and reminds them that God is the answer to everything. They leave followed by Poppy and the play ends.

They were active in the 1980s in New York City's Chinatown. The early 1990s proved to be detrimental to the Vietnamese collective following the arrest and prosecution of most of their New York-based operatives by the fall of 1992. BTK is said to have formed into Mafia organized crime in the year 2020, spanning from the Tri-State area to Australia. History The gang that would be known throughout Manhattan Chinatown as Born to Kill was founded by Tho Hoang \\"David\\" Thai, who was born in Saigon on January 30, 1956. After the Fall of Saigon, with the help of his father, Dieu Thai, David Thai left Vietnam as a refugee in May 1975, where he then made his way to the U.S. Eventually, David Thai found himself in Lafayette, Indiana, where he lived in a small home for boys that was owned by the local Lutheran church, but in May 1976, with $150 in his pocket, Thai ran away from the church house and hopped on a Greyhound bus destined for New York City. There, as a youth in New York City, Thai worked at various different jobs, ranging from being a busboy to being a dishwasher for a Manhattan restaurant, and in 1978, Thai met and married a fellow Vietnamese refugee. Struggling to provide for his new family however, Thai turned to crime, and in 1983, for a short period of time, David Thai was consigned as a member of the Vietnamese Flying Dragons, a small branch of the Flying Dragons gang, and as a gang member he occasionally committed robberies but was never caught. After a few years, Thai left the Flying Dragons and branched out on his own, establishing a budding multimillion-dollar counterfeit watch business. During the mid to late-eighties, many Vietnamese youths began arriving in New York City, and many of them, being ostracized by the Chinatown community, were homeless and lived on the fringes of the community. Using his newfound wealth, David Thai began to assist these street youths by freely offering them advice, money and a place to stay, causing many of them to feel indebted to Thai and follow him, forming the beginnings of the gang. In late 1987, law enforcement had cracked down on and weakened several of Chinatown‚Äôs established gangs. The previous year, twenty-one members of the Ghost Shadows were arrested on racketeering charges. A few months later, eight members of the United Bamboo gang were arrested on similar charges, weakening Chinatown‚Äôs traditional gang structure even further. With his watch business in place, Thai seized on the occasion by taking control of Canal Street, which would later become the gang‚Äôs main base of operations. Using the profits from the watch enterprise, David Thai organized a meeting between him and several high-ranking members of a Vietnamese street gang that called themselves the \\"Canal Boys\\", but the gang's name would later be established as \\"Born to Kill\\" in 1988. The phrase Born to Kill was adopted from the slogan that U.S helicopters and soldiers had on their helmets during the Vietnam War. During the late eighties, as the Born to Kill gang began to attract publicity and notoriety in Manhattan's Chinatown due to their criminal audacity, many smaller groups of organized Vietnamese criminals began to adopt the gang's name. This made Born to Kill a confederation of gangs, which allowed it to expand its criminal operations, exploits and territory into other cities, states, and countries such as Canada. While many these smaller gangs that had adopted the BTK's name were directly associated with the gang, other groups were not directly affiliated with the BTK, although they were identified as such by the media and some police jurisdictions. Most of the gang's members were young ruthless Vietnamese youths who were sent out of their country as the Saigon regime was collapsing, in which afterwards they then spent months or years in refugee camps before being put into foster families. These youths then left their foster families and banded together, forming the nucleus of what would become the Born to Kill gang. During the gang's reign of Chinatown from the late eighties and early nineties, the Pho Hanoi restaurant located in the gang's turf on Canal Street served as an informal headquarters and meeting grounds for the gang. The gang's prowess is often attributed to the chaotic environment of guns and drugs in Vietnam. Born to Kill challenged the authority of established Chinatown gangs. While identified by some as predominantly Vietnamese, Born to Kill consisted of New York native Vietnamese as well as immigrants new to the tri-state area. David Thai and his operations birthed the Canal Street counterfeit market and made it a worldwide tourist visit location for bootlegged items. Activities Starting out as enforcers for Triads and established Chinese organized crime groups such as Flying Dragons, Born to Kill later organized and distanced itself from the Chinese groups, and was well known to ignore or even challenge the authority of the Triad, as the gang considered themselves as not being a part of the traditional Chinatown criminal structure. During the gang's peak from late eighties to the early nineties, the gang was well known to extort from the approximately seventy shops that were located in and around the gang's turf on Canal Street. The gang's leader, David Thai, was infamous for operating a multimillion-dollar counterfeit watch business, and he would later go on to claim to have made $13 million from selling counterfeit watches in 1988 alone. David Thai was also known for running a large brothel, where he imported many Southeast Asian women to serve as prostitutes; the brothel was funded mostly by the American mafia, and in exchange, Thai gave the American mafia a cut of the gang's robbery proceeds. Born to Kill had also built up a reputation for robberies, extortion, and murder throughout the city. The gang was also once embroiled in a violent conflict with the Chinese Ghost Shadows over turf of the lucrative activities. To this date they are still regarded as one of the most violent Asian organized crime groups to have ever existed in New York City. Peak activity Gang members were predominantly in their teens and 20s, although they ranged from fifteen to thirty-five, and were known to target restaurant owners, storekeepers and merchants along Canal Street. Some members were recruited from areas near the Bronx High School of Science. In July 1990 there were believed to be as many as 80 active members in New York City and by October 1992, when their activities in Chinatown had diminished significantly, there were still factions of the gang remaining and operating in the State of Georgia and Canada. Peak numbers in New York may have ranged as high as 100, with chapters of the gang operating in New Jersey, California and Texas. Gang members were tattooed with the initials B.T.K, a coffin and three candles, signifying no fear of dying. Born to Kill members were also well known to have fashioned themselves after gangster movies, donning dark sunglasses and black suits along with spiked hair. Outside New York The gang's spread was most prevalent in areas with an established Vietnamese presence, including smaller cities such as Biloxi, Mississippi and larger cities such as Dallas, Texas. Once active in other cities and states, the gang did not always maintain the same activities as they did in New York. In Sacramento, California, Born to Kill was active in less-visible areas such as computer-chip theft, as well as the sale of guns to young Vietnamese. One of the areas where the gang was most active was Atlanta and Doraville, Georgia where it continued to operate as late as December 1996. Decline On August 1991, the gang's founder and leader, David Thai, was arrested along with several other top-tier members of the Born to Kill gang at one of the gang's safe havens in Melville, Long Island. It was believed to have been David Thai's first arrest. This event led to the conviction of seven gang members on federal racketeering charges in April 1992. Most of the gang members were sentenced from between 13 and 60 years, while David Thai and two other members were sentenced to life. After the collapse of the gang's leadership, much of the remaining leaders of the Born to Kill gang that had avoided arrest were believed to have had relocated to the Versailles neighborhood in New Orleans, Louisiana. Present While law enforcement dealt a major blow to the gang, the gang is still alleged to be active albeit not as omnipresent as they used to be. Chapters of the gang still operate in New York City and Philadelphia and are still involved in organized criminal activities.

It was listed as a monument historique in 1840.Monumentum.fr It was formerly the seat of the Bishops of Condom; the diocese was added to the Archdiocese of Auch in 1822. Building description The cathedral dominates the town, which sits on a hill above the Ba√Øse River. It was designed at the end of the 15th century and erected from 1506 to 1531, making it one of the last major buildings in the Gers region to be constructed in the Southern French Gothic style of south-west France. The church has buttresses all around and there is a square tower over the west front. The west front door has the Four Evangelists' symbols in the tympanum, and the south nave door in the Flamboyant Gothic style has 24 small statues in the niches of the archivolt. Condom Cathedral Inside, the wide aisleless nave is lit by the clerestory windows with grisaille glass. There is a neo-Gothic openwork screen from 1844 around the chancel, which demarcates it from the ambulatory. The stained glass in the choir is from the 19th century. This cathedral was famous for its sumptuous 16th-century liturgy and for its organ of 1605 at the west end. This is commemorated in the choir vault bosses with figures of angel musicians. The original pulpit with its delicately carved stone baldaquin is still in place. The 16th-century cloister is now a public passageway adjoining a car park, the exterior of which is illuminated at night.

She was built in 1774 in the Province of Massachusetts Bay and served as an unarmed private fishing boat for eight months before Vice- Admiral Samuel Graves purchased her for the Royal Navy in January 1775 for ¬£750.Letter to Philip Stevens from the flagship HMS Preston, Boston, 8 January 1775, Naval Documents of the American Revolution, Vol 1. (1964), p. 59-60. According to Graves, the Diana was \\"so exceedingly well built that she is allowed to be the best Vessel of the Kind that has been yet in the King‚Äôs Service.\\" Diana was refitted and armed with four 6-pounders and twelve swivel guns to help enforce the Boston Port Act. She was placed under the command of Vice-Admiral Graves's nephew, Lieutenant Thomas Graves. Open warfare between the combatants began with the Battle of Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775. During the siege of Boston that immediately followed, the new American Patriot army surrounded Boston with troops, but British forces had naval supremacy over all the waterways nearby and occupied Boston itself. On 27 May 1775 Diana experienced unfavourable winds while exchanging fire with colonial land forces under John Stark during the Battle of Chelsea Creek. Rowboats began to tow her to safety, but the rowers were forced to leave their task under heavy fire. Diana drifted and ran aground on the Chelsea shore. General Israel Putnam then arrived with Patriot reinforcements and two cannon. Putnam offered \\"good quarter\\" to the sailors of Diana if they would surrender, but this offer was not accepted. The schooner rolled onto her side due to the lowering tide, but the crew continued to fire cannon when they were unable to stand on her deck.McKay, Robert D.The Battle of Chelsea Creek: An account of the second engagement of the American Revolution, 27 May 1775. (1928) Chelsea Evening Record. The British escaped Diana soon after midnight on 28 May, fleeing to the sloop Britannia, tender of HMS Somerset. The Britannia, under the command of Thomas Graves's brother John Graves, was able to escape the shallow water and return to safety.

It was from his reign that the dynasty began to fall into decline. Ancestry and Relations Arcesilaus II was the son of the third Greek Cyrenaean King Battus II, while his mother is unknown. His paternal aunt was the Greek Cyrenaean Princess Critola and his paternal grandfather was the second Greek Cyrenaean King Arcesilaus I. Arcesilaus‚Äô wife Eryxo was his paternal cousin, and was Critola‚Äôs youngest child. Arcesilaus and Eryxo had married before he succeeded his father. His father died in 560 BC and Arcesilaus ascended the throne. Arcesilaus and Eryxo had a child who was the future Cyrenaean King Battus III. Plutarch states Arcesilaus had another paternal cousin called Polyarchus, who was Eryxo‚Äôs eldest brother. Arcesilaus also had other paternal male cousins, though the historian doesn‚Äôt give their names. Character Plutarch states that Arcesilaus' character was different from his father‚Äôs and received the surname ‚ÄòThe Oppressor‚Äò, because his character and appearance was of a rugged deposition. During his father‚Äôs reign Arcesilaus had built fortifications around his house and became known throughout Cyrenaica for doing this. Learchus When Arcesilaus became King he had a man called Learchus or Laarchus, who became his advisor. Herodotus states that Learchus was his brother, however Plutarch states that Learchus was an ill-mannered and vicious friend. Arcesilaus followed the counsels of Learchus and became more of a tyrant than a king. Learchus was secretly plotting behind Arcesilaus to become Cyrenaica‚Äôs new king. Learchus had ordered the banishment and deaths of noble Cyrenaeans. When Arcesilaus had found out about Learchus‚Äô plotting, Arcesilaus had quarrelled with Learchus about the kingship and Learchus falsely blamed his plotting on him. Arcesilaus had ordered Learchus and his supporters to be exiled from Cyrenaica. Learchus and his supporters left Cyrene and created their own settlement called Barca, (sometimes known as Meri, Libya). During the construction of Barca, Learchus was able to persuade local Libyans to withdraw their allegiance from Cyrene and encourage them to come with him and to declare war on Arcesilaus. Learchus and the local Libyans were alarmed of the Cyrenaean troops approaching them and they hastily withdrew. Arcesilaus and the Cyrenaean troops chased Learchus and his supporters as far as Leucon, when Learchus and his supporters decided to attack the king and his army. Arcesilaus and the Cyrenaean troops were defeated and he lost up to 7,000 hoplites. Death and burial Not so long after the defeat, near Leucon Arcesilaus became very ill after drinking a poisonous drink containing a deadly fish called a sea-hare. According to Plutarch this fish when consumed is fatal to people. Learchus strangled and killed Arcesilaus in 550 BC. Learchus returned to Cyrene and after his attempt to become the new king, Eryxo and Polyarchus successfully plotted to have Learchus murdered. Then Battus III was proclaimed king by Polyarchus. Arcesilaus‚Äô body was returned to Cyrene and was buried near his paternal ancestors.

Route description PA 478 begins at an intersection with PA 38 and its concurrency with PA 208 northeast of the borough of Emlenton. The highway progressed to the southeast, crossing into Clarion County. There, PA 478 enters a partial interchange with I-80, intersecting with the westbound ramps for Exit 45\\\\. After I-80, PA 478 turns from its southward progression to the southeast, crossing through dense forestry. The highway soon turns back to the south, paralleling Freeman Road and entering the borough of St. Petersburg. In St. Petersburg, PA 478 becomes Salem Avenue, progressing southeast through residential homes and terminating at an intersection with PA 58 (Main Street). History The alignment of PA 478 began in the 1928 numbering of state highways as an unnumbered state highway. However, the next year, the alignment was designated as part of PA 238, which ran from Saint Petersburg to Shippensville. This lasted only seven years, when PA 238 was realigned to terminate in Mariasville. In 1936, the alignment was replaced with PA 378, which remained intact as its alignment designation until 1961, when I-378 was designated for a freeway in Bethlehem.

By 1941, Zhongdian signed a deal with the head of the Xinhua Film Company, Zhang Shankun, followed quickly by two other deals with the Yihua Film Company and the Guohua Film Company.Fu, p. 182  Casting  The film was cast primarily with Chinese actors out of (what remained) of the Shanghai studio system (now under the control of Zhonglian). One major star cast, however, was the Manchuria-born Japanese actress Yoshiko Yamaguchi. Though she had already starred in several Chinese features under her Chinese name of Li Xianglan, Yamaguchi was a seeming outlier in the cast of Eternity. She was, therefore, an indication of the control the Japanese exercised over the Chinese film industry in Shanghai. (ref \\"Her Traces are Found Everywhere\\" 227, Shelly Stevenson, in Cinema and Urban Culture in Shanghai 1922-1943) Helped by the massive pop hits, \\"Candy- Peddling Song\\" (Ë≥£Á≥ñÊ≠å) and \\"Quitting (opium) Song\\" (ÊàíÁÖôÊ≠å), the film would catapult Li into stardom, as her earlier works had been in films so blatantly pro-Japanese, as to turn off most of the Chinese audience (Shelly, 227).

Lyman also served a term as a member of the 14th Utah State Legislature from 1923 to 1924. Early life Amy Cassandra Brown was born in Pleasant Grove, Utah Territory on February 7, 1872, to John Brown and Margaret Zimmerman Brown. John Brown was a polygamist, and Amy Brown was his 23rd of 25 children. He was also a leader of the Mississippi Latter-day Saints. Amy Brown attended high school at Brigham Young Academy (BYA) from 1888 to 1890. For part of her time at BYA, Brown lived in the home of Karl G. and Anna Meith Maeser. Maeser appointed Brown to head the Primary Department at BYA. Brown worked as a teacher at BYA from 1890 to 1894, and later taught elementary school in Salt Lake City for two years. Marriage Lyman in 1914 At BYA she met Richard Lyman, her future husband who would become an LDS Church apostle in 1918. Brown and Lyman's plans to marry were postponed because the University of Michigan, where Lyman was studying, did not allow married students. After Lyman graduated in 1896, the couple was married in the Salt Lake Temple, and the ceremony was performed by Joseph F. Smith. The couple had two children: Wendell Brown and Margaret. After their marriage, Richard Lyman was a professor on engineering at the University of Utah. Amy Lyman took classes from the university, including English and history. In 1902, the Lymans went to New York so that Richard could begin his graduate studies at Cornell University. On their way, they went to a summer session at the University of Chicago. While in Chicago, Lyman enrolled in a class on sociology. She became involved in Settlement House programs and associated with Jane Addams. After her husband graduated from Cornell University, the couple returned to Utah. Prior to the Second World War, Lyman accompanied her husband to England where he presided over the church's European Mission from 1936 to 1938. In Europe, Lyman presided over women's organizations. LDS Church service Alice Louise Reynolds, Amy Brown Lyman, Grace Raymond Hebard, Mrs. Weston Vernon, Ruth Moench Bell Susa Young Gates Relief Society Lyman was called as a member of the general board Relief Society in 1909. She served for two years, and served as assistant secretary for two years. After that, she was the general secretary-treasurer for 15 years. She helped the Relief Society use more modern practices like office machines and filing systems. She also collected minutes from their meetings and other historical documents. While on the general board, she established Social Service Department under Joseph F. Smith's authorization. From 1928 to 1940, Lyman was the first counselor to president Louise Y. Robison in the Relief Society general presidency. As a counselor, she transferred stored wheat collected under Brigham Young to the General Welfare Program. She also assisted in the centennial celebration of Relief Society. Lyman succeeded Robison as president in 1940 and served until 1945. Lyman received numerous honors which include election to the Social Science Honor Society of America, the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Brigham Young University, honorary membership in the American Association of Mental Deficiency, and the Honorary Life Membership Award from the Utah State Conference of Social Work. In 1943, the First Presidency discovered that Richard Lyman had a relationship with another woman since 1925, which resulted in his excommunication on November 12, 1943, for violations of the law of chastity. Due to the marital problems resulting from her husband's infidelity, Lyman requested that she be released.Dave Hall, A Faded Legacy: Amy Brown Lyman and Mormon Women's Activism, 1872-1959 (University of Utah Press, 2015) She was honorably released on April 6, 1945, and was succeeded by her second counselor, Belle S. Spafford. Social welfare department Part of Lyman's work in the Relief Society included her contributions to the social welfare department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Lyman studied at the University of Colorado and earned a certificate in social service. She was a member of the State Council on Defense in Utah and was chair of its social service committee. She was selected to be a delegate to the National Conference of Social Work in June 1917. In 1919, Lyman founded and headed the Relief Society Social Service Department as part of the church's Relief Society program. She would head the department for 16 years. In 1973, the organization became a corporation separate from the church's Relief Society and was renamed LDS Social Services. (The organization has since been renamed Family Services.) As head of the Social Service Department, Lyman created a training program in which stake delegates attended classes in family welfare work. They would then return to their stakes and to teach these lessons to the members of the church. Over 4,000 students were trained through the curriculum she established for those classes. Utah House of Representatives Lyman served a term as a member of the 14th Utah State Legislature from 1923-1924. As a representative, she pushed for statewide support of the federal Sheppard‚ÄìTowner Act, which provided for federally financed instruction in maternal and infant health care and gave matching funds to individual U.S. states to build women's health care clinics. The Sheppard‚ÄìTowner Act was one of the most significant achievements of Progressive-era maternalist reformers. Other contributions Throughout her life, Lyman was involved with the Red Cross. She attended a Red Cross training seminar on welfare work in Colorado in 1917, and by 1918 she was a trustee and vice-president of her community clinic, organizer of the Municipal Department of Health and Charity, chairperson of the Family Consultation Committee of the Red Cross and the vice-president of State Welfare Commission. She also participated in national organizations like the American Child Hygiene Association, Home Services Institute, American Association for Mental Deficiency and the National Tuberculosis Association. Under her influence, Brigham Young University created its first classes in family welfare work. She was also involved with the National Council of Women. She contributed to the establishment of the Utah State Training School in 1929, for whom she was a trustee for eleven years. Lyman raised her granddaughter, Amy Kathryn Lyman (daughter of Lyman's son Wendell), after Lyman's daughter-in-law was killed in 1924. Her son Wendell committed suicide in 1933. Her husband was later rebaptized into the church in 1954. Lyman died on December 5, 1959 in the house of her daughter where she had been recovering from a fall. Works Lyman wrote a number of articles that were published in the Relief Society Magazine. ReferencesFurther reading * Hall, Dave.

Early life Born into a Maltese Nationalist family in Senglea on 10 August 1915, Pisani enrolled as a student at the pro-Italian Umberto I art lyceum in Valletta. In his teens he attended the network of pro-Italian and pro-fascist organisations in Malta: Valletta's Casa del Fascio (headed by professor Umberto Biscottini)Stefano Fabei, Carmelo Borg Pisani, 1915-1942, eroe o traditore?, Lo Scarabeo, Bologna, 2007, p. 19. and OGIE (Organizzazioni Giovanili Italiane all'Estero), through which he attended youth camps in Italy, such as Campo Dux in Viareggio in 1930 and another camp in Rome in 1932.CARMELO BORG PISANI E I FASCISTI MALTESI, ISSES He moved to Italy to attend the Accademia di belle arti di Roma along with other prominent Maltese artists such as Emvin Cremona. He lived in the Italian government-funded \\"Casa della Redenzione Maltese\\", where he met other Maltese irredentists, with whom he shared the conviction that the British colonial government was destroying the \\"Italian soul\\" of Malta. He also believed that the best opportunity to restore Malta to its original state was to expel the British and unite the island to the Kingdom of Italy. In Rome, Pisani chaired the ‚ÄúCircolo degli Amici della Storia di Malta‚Äù and joined the ‚ÄúComitato d'Azione Maltese‚Äù, headed by exiled activist Carlo Mallia from the University of Malta. As Director, Pisani took part in the publication in exile of the irredentist newspaper Malta, which had been forbidden by the British colonial authority. Pisani was a supporter of fascism. In 1935, he unsuccessfully tried to embark as a volunteer for the fascist war in Ethiopia.Stefano Fabei, Carmelo Borg Pisani, 1915-1942, eroe o traditore?, Lo Scarabeo, Bologna, 2007, p. 20. Between 1939 and 1940, he joined the Gruppi Universitari Fascisti and then the Partito Nazionale Fascista. During World War II After the entry of Italy in the Second World War on 10 June 1940, Pisani renounced his British citizenship, returning his British passport through the American embassy (which represented British interests in Rome). Yet he never formally requested nor obtained Italian citizenship, despite later serving in the Italian army.Il Giornale He also wrote a letter to Mussolini to volunteer for service, but was refused by the Italian Army due to his strong myopia. Thanks to recommendations, including Biscottini's, Pisani was admitted into the blackshirts, the fascist militia, and later also joined the Servizio Informazioni Militari, the military intelligence. With the blackshirts he participated in the Italian occupation of Kefallinia in Greece, where he was injured.

Excerpt of the Sunday Times of Malta about Borg Pisani's execution On 18 May 1942 Pisani volunteered for an espionage mission to Malta, to check British defenses and help prepare for the planned Axis invasion of the island (Operation Herkules). He disembarked at the Dingli Cliffs in Ras id-Dawwara, and transferred all his rations to a cave that he knew well from his youth. Unusually inclement weather and a rough sea, however, washed all his possessions away within 48 hours, and he proved unable to climb the cliffs. He was forced to wave down a local boat. Upon rescue by a British patrol boat, he was brought to the naval hospital RNH Mtarfa.The Independent, Italian Group commemorates Carmelo Borg Pisani‚Äôs hanging There, Pisani was recognized by one of his childhood friends, Cpt. Tom Warrington, who denounced him. British Intelligence kept him under arrest in a house in Sliema till August. He was then transferred to Corradino prison, accused of treason. On 12 November 1942 he stood trial under closed doors in front of three judges, headed by Chief Justice Sir Georg Borg, and defended by two lawyers. His plea that he had renounced British citizenship by returning his passport and acquisition of Italian citizenship (which would have granted him status of prisoner of war) was not upheld by the military court. On 19 November 1942 he was publicly sentenced to death for espionage, for taking up arms against the Government and forming part of a conspiracy to overthrow the government.The Santa Marija Convoy: Faith and Endurance in Wartime Malta, 1940‚Äì1942 His execution by hanging took place at 7:30AM on Saturday, 28 November, after rejection of pleas for reversal and for clemency. His remains, initially buried inside Corradino Prison, are now in the ossuary of the cemetery of Paola. According to Mark Harwood, Pisani might have been betrayed by the Italian Fascists themselves, who by sending him alone on an espionage mission to Malta (where he was very likely to be captured and executed) could have been looking for a propaganda coup against the British with the Maltese population at the height of the war‚Äîbut the plan did not work.Times of Malta Frank Leighton considered him \\"a gullible victim of fascist Italy's propaganda\\".Frayed Lifelines: A Siege Survivor's Story, By Frank Leighton Legacy In Italy, Borg Pisani was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor, the highest Italian military award, by King Victor Emmanuel III a few days after his death.Italian Republic official list and motivation Benito Mussolini called him a \\"Maltese Martyr\\" and in November 1943 created in his honor in Liguria the blackshirts Battaglione Borg Pisani in which other Maltese irredentists fought.Italian Blackshirt 1935‚Äì45 By Pier Paolo Battistelli, Piero Crociani The art academy where he had studied in Rome was for a brief time rechristened La Regia Accademia di Belle Arti Borg Pisani, and streets in Rome, Turin, Bari and Legnano are still named after him. A neo-fascist group commemorated his death in front of Malta's embassy in Rome in 2010.

The capsule does not elongate much, and remains buried among surrounding leaves. There are fifteen species of Diphyscium. However, two of these species formerly were placed in the southeast Asian genus Theriotia, and one species, from Chile, formerly was segregated in the monotypic genus Muscoflorschuetzia. In 2003, Magombo proposed reclassifying all fifteen species as belonging to the single genus Diphyscium.

It was built in 1875 and removed in 1970. The bridge had two levels: an upper deck carrying the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and a lower deck for road traffic. A swing section (replaced by a bascule after a ship strike in 1932) allowed river traffic to pass. The alignment of the bridge carried it from Remington Street in Fall River to the junction of Riverside Avenue, Brayton Avenue and Wilbur Avenue in Somerset.

Jonathan Shaw & Bernard Goffinet (Eds.), Bryophyte Biology. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). . The majority of species belong to the genera Funaria (c. 200 species) and Physcomitrium (c. 80 species). Classification The Funariidae include three monotypic orders, with around 350 species, most of which belong either to the genus Funaria or Physcomitrium. : Order Encalyptales :: Family Encalyptaceae (2 genera, 35 species) : : Order Funariales :: Family Funariaceae (14 genera, ca. 300 species) : : Order Disceliales :: Family Disceliaceae (1 species Discelium nudum) Description Species in the subclass Funariidae typically live on or near the ground. Their stems typically have a central strand differentiated from the surrounding cells. The peristome teeth of their sporangia are arthrodontous, diplolepidous, and opposite.Goffinet, Bernard, & William R Buck. 2004. \\"Systematics of the Bryophyta (Mosses): from molecules to a revised classification\\", pages 205-239 in Bernard Goffinet, Victoria Holowell, & Robert Magill (Eds.), Molecular Systematics of Bryophytes. (St. Louis: Missouri Botanical Garden Press). . They are acrocarpous, producing their archegonia at the upper tips of the stem, and hence sporophyte stalks arise from the tip of the stem as well. The capsule of the order Funariales has a well-defined ring of cells called an annulus. When these cells die, their walls rupture, allowing the sporangium lid to fall off, and revealing the peristome. In the other two orders, the annulus is not differentiated. In the Gigaspermales, the capsule is not raised above the plant on a stalk, but remains hidden from view among the leaves. In the Encalyptales, the capsule is jacketed inside the calyptra long after it is raised above the plant, giving the appearance of a tiny mushroom.

It addresses the questions \\"What is knowledge?\\", \\"How is knowledge acquired?\\", \\"What do people know?\\", \\"How do we know what we know?\\", and \\"Why do we know what we know?\\". Much of the debate in this field has focused on analyzing the nature of knowledge and how it relates to similar notions such as truth, belief, and justification. It also deals with the means of production of knowledge, as well as skepticism about different knowledge claims.
