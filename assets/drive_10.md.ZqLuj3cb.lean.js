It defended London during the Battle of Britain and The Blitz.

Men of a TA battery training on a 3-inch gun at their drill hall in 1938. Responsible to London District but under the operational control of RAF Fighter Command, the Division's role was to command the growing number of Territorial Army (TA) anti-aircraft gun and searchlight units around London (the 2nd AA Division was formed in 1936 to cover the rest of the country).Farndale, p. 2. The headquarters of the division was formed by converting the headquarters of the 47th (2nd London) Infantry Division, whose General Officer Commanding, Major-General R.H.D. Thomson, continued as GOC of the new formation.Monthly Army List September 1935‚ÄìJanuary 1936. Thomson had been Commander TA Air Defence Brigades and Inspector of Regular AA Units, and thus already responsible for the four brigades or 'groups' that comprised the division. He also chaired the War Office committee on expansion and mobilisation of TA AA units, which sat from 1935 to 1937. Tompson was followed in 1937 by Maj-Gen Sir Frederick Pile, who was promoted in 1939 to command the whole of Anti-Aircraft Command.Routledge, pp. 59, 369‚Äì70, Table VIII.

The AA Divisions were unlike field formations: they were established to organise training and later exercise operational command in the static conditions of home defence, but relied entirely on the Home Forces commands for logistic support, supplies, and heavy repairs.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6. Mobilisation 3.7-inch AA guns deployed in Hyde Park, London during an air defence exercise in August 1939. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis. The staff of the 1st AA Division now had to implement the Tompson Committee's plan. The call-out of key parties by telephone and telegram went well, and they assembled at their drill halls within a few hours. Because the units possessed only a small scale of transport, elaborate plans had been made to requisition civilian vehicles, ranging from heavy lorries to buses and private cars. Equipment was drawn from mobilisation stores, and the detachments ferried out to their war stations. Despite some failures and problems, the emergency positions covering London were manned and most of the equipment was in place within 24 hours. The emergency mobilisation lasted nearly three weeks before the TA units were released on 14 October. The experience brought about improvements in equipment scales, and a rapid expansion of AA defences brought many new AA gun and searchlight units into existence, some by conversion of TA infantry battalions.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. The existing divisions and brigades were expanded, and the whole AA defence of the United Kingdom was taken over by Anti-Aircraft Command on 1 April 1939. A new 6th AA Division was formed by duplicating the 1st AA Division's HQ at Uxbridge. The 6th AA Division took over responsibility for defending the Thames Estuary and the adjacent areas of Essex and North Kent, allowing the 1st AA Division to concentrate on the defence of London. The 27th, 28th and 29th AA Brigades were transferred to the new formation. The deterioration in international relations during 1939 led to a partial mobilisation in June, and a proportion of TA AA units manned their war stations under a rotation system known as 'Couverture'. Full mobilisation of AA Command came in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September 1939. 1st AA Division graphic in September 1939 just before mobilisation. Order of Battle 1939 When the UK declared war on 3 September 1939, the 1st AA Division had the following composition:Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. GOC: Major-General F.L.M.

Royal Artillery AA units were now designated Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA), Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA), or Searchlight (S/L) regiments and batteries. Defences 206 Brompton Road, the former Brompton Road tube station closed in 1934, used as the headquarters of the London Inner Artillery Zone anti-aircraft defences during World War II The 1st AA Division had established a control centre at a disused Underground station at Brompton Road. The tunnels, subways and lift-shafts were adapted to provide bomb-proof accommodation for a Central Operation Room reporting direct to HQ No. 11 Group RAF at Uxbridge, and four Gun Operations Rooms (GORs) subdividing the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ). An elaborate network of dedicated telephone lines was laid by the General Post Office and Royal Corps of Signals, linking the AA sites, including many isolated searchlight positions.Routledge, pp. 388‚Äì9. On mobilisation in August 1939, the 1st AA Division controlled 159 HAA guns, 96 searchlights, and a mixture of LAA guns (1 x 3-inch, 1 x 40mm Bofors and 52 light machine-guns (LMGs)). Most of the HAA guns were assigned to the IAZ, with one troop of 4 guns at RAF Fighter Command HQ at Stanmore and four more (16 guns) at airfields.Routledge, Tables LVIII & LIX, pp. 376‚Äì7. The London IAZ extended from Cheshunt and Dagenham in the east to Bexley and Mitcham in the south and to Richmond and Northolt in the west. The HAA positions were sited to produce an optimum density of fire of at least 16 guns engaging any one raid simultaneously. It had been intended that the 26th AA Brigade would control the whole zone, but it proved too complex for one HQ, and in September 1939 it was divided among three: the 26th AA Brigade (34 sites disposed to north and east), the 48th AA Brigade (28 sites to south-east and south), and the 49th AA Brigade (12 sites to west). The 26th AA Brigade still had the heaviest concentration of guns, mainly static 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch guns, with sites being increased from four to eight guns each. The 48th AA Brigade had a mixture of 3.7 and 4.5-inch guns, half of the former being mobile. The 49th AA Brigade had older 3-inch guns, but also controlled a higher proportion of LAA sites at Vital Points (VPs). Superimposed on the IAZ were the 73 searchlight sites controlled by the 38th AA Brigade.Routledge, p. 388. Battle of Britain The crew of a 4.5-inch static AA gun at Clapham Common take post in August 1940 On 5 June 1940, after the British Army had been evacuated from Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain was about to start, the 1st AA Division comprised 45 4.5-inch, 39 3.7-inch and 26 3-inch HAA guns, with three 3-inch, 19 Bofors, three twin Vickers and 185 LMGs in the LAA role, together with 240 90 cm searchlights.Routledge, Table LXI, p. 379. On 11 July, the division's guns were disposed with 92 defending London, 28 at Slough, 4 at Hounslow, 4 at Stanmore, and 34 others dispersed to VPs.Farndale, pp. 105, 109. While the Luftwaffe attacked RAF airfields, only the guns of the 48th AA Brigade in south-east London were engaged. On 1 September, over 200 aircraft attacked Maidstone, RAF Biggin Hill, RAF Kenley and Chatham: the guns of the 1st and 6th AA Divisions broke up the attacks but Kenley and Biggin Hill were badly hit. The following day a raid up the Thames estuary reached the edge of the London IAZ and were engaged by the 26th AA Brigade. Between 11 and 15 September, massed raids approached London, but running battles with RAF fighters broke up most of the raids before they reached the IAZ, where they were engaged by the 48th AA Brigade.Routledge, pp. 383‚Äì5. The Blitz 3.7-inch gun in Richmond Park 1940 By 30 September, when the Battle of Britain was effectively over and the Luftwaffe had switched to night raids over London (The Blitz), by now the 1st AA Division had 233 HAA guns, 60 LAA guns, 161 LMGs and 242 searchlights covering the London IAZ, together with 36 HAA guns defending Slough, Langley, Weybridge and airfields.Routledge, Table LXII, p. 380. In the absence of inland radar coverage, the 1st AA Division's Chief Signals Officer, Lt-Col G.C. Wickens, devised a system of 14 fixed base-lines of sound locators to detect night raids approaching the IAZ. These were linked by automatic telephone equipment to the Brompton operations room, where the angular plots were resolved to indicate grid squares where the HAA guns in range could fire an unseen barrage. This 'Fixed Azimuth' system came into action in June 1940, in time for the opening of the night Blitz on London. It was later replaced as searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced. Loading a mobile Z Battery projector However, the performance of the AA defences in the early weeks of the Blitz was poor. AA Command moved 108 HAA guns to the IAZ from other divisions, and arranged 'fighter nights' when the guns remained silent and RAF night fighters were allowed to operate over London with the searchlights. GL radar, modern sound- locators and larger (150 cm) searchlights were introduced as rapidly as possible. From September 1940, rocket projectors (Z Batteries) were introduced, equipped with rocket projectiles, and by February 1941, SLC began to be issued. The number of raiders shot down steadily increased until mid-May 1941, when the Luftwaffe scaled down its attacks.Routledge, pp. 389‚Äì91. During 1941 increasing numbers of women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) took over roles in AA Command. Where they were integrated into units these were designated 'Mixed' ('M').Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì400. Mid-war Towards the end of 1940, at the height of The Blitz, AA Command formed three AA Corps: the 1st AA Division formed part of I AA Corps in Southern England.Pile's despatch.

His research has included the Byzantine influence on ancient synagogues, demography of Palestine in the Byzantine period, mosaics at Horvat Berachot, excavations at Beit She'an, and excavations at Rehoboth (in the Negev). A Professor Emeritus of the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he was a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Biography Yoram Tsafrir was born in 1938 in Kfar Azar in Tel Aviv District. A graduate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1976, he became senior lecturer there in 1978, professor in 1987, and professor emeritus in 2006. From 1989 until 1992 he was Head of the Institute of Archaeology and was Director of the Jewish National and University Library from 2001 to 2007. He was also visiting Fellow at the Harvard University, Dumbarton Oaks, Washington DC. Yoram Tsafrir died on 23 November 2015 at a hospital in Jerusalem.http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.687891 Work His work mainly involved the archaeology and history of Palestine and the East during the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic periods. His archaeological excavations covered Bet She'an-Scythopolis, Rehoboth in the Negev, Alexandreion (Sartaba), Horvat Berachot (between Bethlehem and Hebron) and many other sites. Tsafrir has claimed that by around the year 400 C.E., Christians \\"constituted the majority in Palestine.\\" He has also concluded that virtually no synagogue buildings in Palestine can be dated to the second and early third centuries. In Jerusalem, Tsafrir worked on numerous monuments, including Acra Fortress and Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos. From 1974‚Äì1975 on, he superintended and updated the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a project of Michael Avi-Yonah (1904‚Äì1974), whose student he was. With Yitzhak Magen, he published Two Seasons of Excavations at Sartaba/Alexandrium Fortress (1984). In 1993, he published Ancient Churches Revealed. In the same year, Tsafrir and Gideon Foerster organized a study group at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Givat Ram, on the topic of conceptualizing the end of ancient Mediterranean cities. His work also involves research into the geography of historical Palestine, and he has co-authored Tabula Imperii Romani Iudaea-Palaestina: Eretz Israel in the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine Periods; Maps and Gazetteer. Tsafrir and Gideon Foerster's preliminary exploration and conclusions on Beit She'an/Scythopolis, were reported in \\"Urbanism at Scythopolis: Bet Shean in the fourth to seventh centuries\\" (1997), which was followed by \\"Skythopolis: Vorposten der Dekapolis\\" (2002). His critical review of \\"Numismatics and the Foundation of Aelia Capitolina\\" appears in Peter Shafer's The Bar Kokhba War Reconsidered (2003). He has contributed to The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land. Model of Jerusalem A scale model of Jerusalem giving a vivid view of the city as it existed before it was destroyed by Romans in 70 AD, was prepared by the archaeologists associated with the study of the city's ancient culture. The project was sponsored in 1964 by the Holyland Hotel of Jerusalem. It was made between 1964‚Äì1974 by Michael Avi-Yonah and was refined and elaborated by Tsafrir. The model was made with authentic material such as stone and marble from Jerusalem itself, embellished with colorful small ceramic tiles and gold leaf used for gilding the Temple and palaces. The model was built to a scale of 1:50 and was provided with illustrations and explanatory pamphlets by Tsafrir.

Monk is a lieutenant in the Stanfield organization, and probably the third most recognized leader of the Stanfield Organization. Monk is shown throughout the series in dual roles as both an occasional enforcer but mostly as the organization's drug supply-coordinator. In contrast to Snoop or Chris, Monk was tasked by Marlo with non-combative goals, such as handing out money to school children to enhance Marlo's street reputation, and keeping crew chiefs organized. Monk is also responsible for all phone activity in the organization and largely acts as an intermediary between Marlo and the rest of the organization. Biography Season four His non-combative role as a lieutenant hardens him and he rarely displays any understanding for anyone outside the organization or anything that impedes their status. He is first shown giving money to kids for Marlo. Monk caretakes Marlo's phone activity as shown in a scene where Old Face Andre calls and Marlo tells Monk to spy on Prop Joe and The Greeks. Monk is responsible for making the organization aware of the camera that the Major Crimes Unit was using to spy on Marlo. When Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise attempts to talk to Michael Lee about his deteriorating conduct at Cutty's gym, Monk shoots Cutty in the leg for refusing to back off, only refraining from killing him at Michael's insistence. At the end of Season Four, Monk is partly responsible for the death of Preston \\"Bodie\\" Broadus as he sees him with Jimmy McNulty and reports it to Marlo, who then orders Bodie's death. Season five Monk is handed the responsibility of wholesaling drugs to the entire west side of Baltimore by Season Five, when Marlo assumes control of the New Day Co-Op following the murder of Proposition Joe. His recognized status as the top lieutenant within the organization makes him one of nine active targets listed on Omar's hitlist. His role expands to being Marlo's second in dealings with the Co-Op, and being responsible for resupplies with The Greeks. Monk shows some hostility when Michael Lee leaves his corner unattended for a day. He also continues occasional enforcer work when he is involved in a drive-by shooting against a rival crew with Snoop and O-Dog. Due to the wire tap investigation, Monk is arrested when pulled over and a whole re-up supply of drugs is found in the trunk of his SUV. He is responsible for persuading Marlo that Michael may be a snitch, though this initially angers Chris. Monk and Cheese's bail chances are initially reviewed by Maurice Levy as likely; however, after Levy's private deal with Rhonda Pearlman, Monk's chances of bail are out of question, as an earlier charge in 2004 as well as the amount of narcotics found in his SUV effectively gives him a nonnegotiable sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

He was the original founder of the Pennsylvania Gazette. On October 2, 1729, Benjamin Franklin bought this newspaper. Early life Keimer was born in the later part of the seventeenth century in the London Borough of Southwark, England. Keimer, like his only sibling, Mary, was at first a follower of the Camisards. Keimer initially learned the trade of printing from a well known London printer. He then opened a printing business in 1713, after had learned his trade. His English business failed, however, and he was thrown into Fleet Prison (a debtors' prison) for not paying his debts. When he got out of prison he went to America leaving his English wife behind. He settled in Philadelphia. In Pennsylvania In 1712 Andrew Bradford was the first person to start a printing business in Philadelphia. In 1723 Keimer opened a printing business near the Market-house in the city. Keimer and Bradford were then the only printers in the colony of Pennsylvania. Keimer had come to America with an old printing press, and a worn-out font of English letters. When Benjamin Franklin, aged 17, came to Philadelphia looking for a job in 1722, he went first to Bradford‚Äôs printing business. Bradford had no job openings, but introduced him to Keimer. Franklin found Keimer trying to set up a composition of his own, the mournful Aquila Rose, ... Clerk of the Assembly and a pretty poet, but having difficulty. Keimer hired Franklin at this time to help put his printing press into working order, since Franklin showed mechanical ability; his position as Keimer's assistant was Franklin's first paid job. Later life In later years Keimer's business dwindled. He decided to sell his print shop business and go to Barbados. There in 1731, at Bridgetown, he published the Barbadoes Gazette. The Gazette was the first newspaper in the Caribbean. In 1733 he was sued for a malicious statement in his paper. He continued to publish the newspaper until its operation ceased in 1738. Works While in debtors' prison Keimer wrote some works considered of little literary value: A Search after Religion among the many Modern Pretenders to it, London [1718], and A Brand Pluck'd from the Burning exemplify'd in the unparallel'd case of Samuel Keimer, London, 1718. A Brand Pluck'd from the Burning... contained disagreements and disputes of the French Protestants. It also spoke of prison life and included a letter from the English trader Daniel Defoe.

It is also a member of the tribe Homotherini within Machairodontidae and is most closely related to such species as Xenosmilus, Homotherium itself, and Nimravides. It inhabited Eurasia, Northern Africa and North America during the late Miocene epoch. Description Front limb There was marked sexual dimorphism in A. giganteus, with males being much larger than females. The species Amphimachairodus coloradensis, from the United States (formerly Machairodus coloradensis) was a significantly large animal, about at the shoulder, according to skeletal and life reconstructions, potentially making it one of the largest known felids. All Amphimachairodus species have a developed mandibular flange, however, A. colaradensis is distinguishable from A. giganteus and A. kurteni by subtle differences in the shape of the mandible and placement of lower carnassials. In size and proportions, the Eurasian species A. giganteus was remarkably similar to a modern lion or tiger and had a shoulder height of . This species has a skull length of around . The African species A. kabir (formerly Machairodus kabir) is suggested to have weighed over . This would make it comparable in size to Xenosmilus, Machairodus horribillis and slightly smaller than Smilodon populator. Amphimachairodus was about long and probably hunted as an ambush predator. Its legs were too short to sustain a long chase, but it most likely was a good jumper. It probably used its canines to cut open the throat of its prey, severing the major arteries and possibly crushing the windpipe. Its teeth were rooted to its mouth and were not as delicate as those of most other saber-toothed cats of the time, which had extremely long canines that hung out of their mouths. The fangs of Amphimachairodus, however, were able to easily fit in its mouth comfortably while being long enough to be effective for hunting. Amphimachairodus also possessed a longer tail than most other large machairodont genera. Skull This specimen was from a large male A. giganteus with the skull measuring from the Late Miocene in China, comparable to a male lion or tiger. Deformation of the skull through natural fossilization processes has changed the shape slightly, making it asymmetrical, but overall it remains an excellent specimen for studying the cranial morphology of this particular genus and species. For felines, this skull is rather long, but rivaled by the skulls of the two largest species of extant cats: the lion and tiger. When compared with the skull of a regular lion, it is long and very narrow, particularly in the muzzle and width of the zygomatic arches. Its sagittal crest is well pronounced. Compared with other machairodonts, the canines are stout and capable of large amounts of stress. This characteristic is slightly remodeled in females, whose canines are slimmer and generally longer. Compared with females, the orbit of males are smaller, muzzles larger, the anterior-most portion of the nasal bones generally flare upwards slightly, and the downward slope of the dorsal edge of the skull in front of the orbit is not as pronounced, producing a straighter profile. Compared with the most well known machairodont Smilodon, commonly referred to as the \\"saber-toothed cat\\", the canines are much shorter, the facial portion again is much longer, and the teeth not reduced so far in number. Several machairodonts, namely Megantereon, bear flanges on the mandible, which are very reduced in A. giganteus though characteristics of the mandible associated with the flanges are present, particularly the lateral flattening of the anterior portion of the mandible, creating a cross section more square than semi-circular. The dental formula for this specimen is . Paleoecology An A. giganteus skull with chipped left canine and more severely damaged right canine. This chipping is not severe enough to be called a true break, which would be in excess of half of the canine Amphimachairodus was an inhabitant of woodlands and open floodplains as based on finds in Pikermi in Greece and Shanxi Province in China, indicating it had habitat preferences similar to modern lions in many respects. Specimens recovered from Turolian deposits indicate that the fauna living there was much the same, differing only by species in many cases. Among the creatures it shared its environment with were bovids such as Parabos, Lutung monkeys, the mastodon Anancus, the rhino Aceratherium, antelopes such as Tragoportax and Miotragocerus as well as gazelles and deer, a very large species of hyrax, early goats, various giraffes, camels such as Paracamelus, the horse Hipparion, a species of aardvark, the chalicothere ancylotherium and the beaver-like Dipoides. Other carnivores it shared its territory with include the bear Agriotherium, fellow machairodonts Metailurus and Paramachairodus and hyenas like Thalassictis. The larger herbivores were likely common prey for Amphimachairodus, and it likely would have competed with Agriotherium for food, possibly yielding kills to the bear and possibly also stealing kills from hyenas such as Thalassictis and from Metailurus when the opportunity arose. In North America, in places such as Coffee Ranch in Texas, Amphimachairodus coloradensis shared territory with Agriotherium as it had in Africa and Eurasia, but also shared territory with the feliform Barbourofelis and the canids Epicyon and Borophagus, and herbivores like the camel Aepycamelus, the pronghorn antelope Cosoryx, horses like Neohipparion and Nannippus, the peccary Prosthennops and rhinoceroses like Teleoceras. In the Djurab desert in northern Chad, Amphimachairodus kabir co-existed with fellow machairodonts Lokotunjailurus, Tchadailurus and early representatives of the genus Megantereon. In addition, animals such as crocodiles, three-toed horses, fish, monkeys, hippos, aardvarks, turtles, rodents, giraffes, snakes, antelopes, pigs, mongooses, foxes, hyenas, otters, honey badgers and the hominid Sahelanthropus dwelled here, providing ample food. Based on these and other fossils, it is theorized that the Djurab was once the shore of a lake, generally forested close to the shore with savannah-like areas some distance away.http://www.livescience.com/10416-sabertooth-cats-feasted-early- humans.html The great number of cat species in the environment indicates that there was significant prey and available niches for multiple species of large felids to coexist.Science PressScientific American See also * Big cat * List of largest carnivorans * List of largest prehistoric carnivorans * Megafauna * Homotherini * Miocene * Quaternary extinction event References Category:Homotherini Category:Miocene mammals of Europe Category:Miocene mammals of Africa Category:Miocene mammals of Asia Category:Miocene mammals of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 1929 ","title":"Amphimachairodus"},{"id":"39081827","text":"Dr Luiz Loures was the Deputy Executive Director, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).

In some forms groups of unrelated species might form, in which interaction between members of the aggregation might be minimal; for example herds of grazing zebra and antelopes might combine, both the better to observe the approach of predators, and to improve the odds of escape in the event of attack by predators. Sometimes there might be some interaction, such as mixed flocks of birds that observe each other's foraging behaviour in searching for food. Sometimes there might be quite orderly common action, such as the queuing up for a resource; for example different species of fishes may aggregate around a cleaning station where cleaner wrasse and cleaner shrimp are active, more or less taking turns for attention. Such aggregations, where there is no particular association of species or sizes, may be referred to loosely as unstructured aggregations. Commonly they are very temporary and may be loose, with flocks or herds associating casually and separating equally casually within hours. Structured aggregations tend to be longer-term and of a specific life-cycle function and context. Typically, though not necessarily, they will be of a single species. Often they will be of a single age and possibly of a single sex, such as shoals of fish fry that have specific ecological requirements that are not compatible with those of the mature species. One class of such aggregations comprises groups of adult, but immature \\"bachelor\\" males of elephants, seals, lions and other animals in which the mature herd will not tolerate males that would begin to compete with the dominant males. Another is when aposematic larvae of certain insects such as some Lepidoptera and Hemiptera form a flock that feed together and may migrate in \\"processions\\" until they are mature after which some kinds disperse. Most species of migrating birds and mammals flock on a large scale, partly for protection and partly for greater reliability of navigation. In some species of Hemiptera the adults remain with their aggregated immature offspring, sometimes in protective roles. The range of functions is very wide in detail, but among the more important classes of function are security against predators, success in food location, wide range of mate choice, with concomitant increase of outbreeding opportunities, location with other members of the same species (sometimes adherence to separate communities can almost amount to parapatric residence when say, different communities of rats or chimpanzees have violent mutual antipathy). There also are various forms of educational function, such as in some species where the young must learn the correct mate recognition skills, and in highly intelligent species such as crows and elephants, must learn the necessary social skills and the necessary traditional foraging techniques in their region. Aggregation activities are not restricted to the animal kingdom; for one example, a fundamental class of aggregations occurs in the various groups of slime molds, in which separate cells actually aggregate in the process of constructing their reproductive structure.

The explosive force propelled the upper portion of the vessel a distance of from its original location, while the base remained at the center of the resultant fire.  Structure  The tower was constructed from thick plates of type ASTM A516 Grade 70 steel per ASME Section VIII pressure vessel code. The vessel was tall, in diameter.  History  Beginning in 1970 the vessel served as an amine absorber tower, used to strip hydrogen sulfide from a process stream of propane and butane. Inspection identified hydrogen blisters and laminations and in 1974 several meters of the lower shell section were completely replaced using manual metal arc welding. After welding, no post weld heat treatment (PWHT), a vital process that reduces the residual stresses formed during welding and restores the macro structure of the steel, was performed. Two years later, in 1976, a Monel liner was installed into the bottom head to reduce corrosion; however, the previously repaired section was not covered by the liner. Prior to the explosion, an operator tried to close off the main inlet valve to stop gas leaking from a horizontal crack the vessel. The crack grew to and the operator initiated evacuation. The crack continued to grow and a significant quantity of flammable gas was released as company fire fighters gathered at the scene. The gas ignited, fatally wounding personnel, damaging the refinery, and launching the upper portion of the vessel to from its original location. Failure analysis of the vessel segments included the following non-destructive testing methods. * Magnetic particle inspection revealed \\"hundreds\\" of cracks along the inner surfaces of the horizontal welds at both the top and bottom of the section replaced in 1974. * Ultrasonic measurements indicated delamination damage below the replaced section. * Thickness measurements using a micrometer showed that the wall thickness for both sections was well within the allowances for pressure vessels. The cause of cracking did not become clear until metallographic results were combined with stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement tests, followed by fracture mechanics analysis. It appeared that an already existing crack had extended through more than 90% of the wall thickness and was about 800 mm in length. Further, it was determined that hydrogen embrittlement had reduced the fracture resistance of the steel by more than half. The vessel had been put into service in 1970 and had undergone several repairs and modifications before the July 1984 incident. The vessel was fractured along a path that was weakened by extensive cracking adjacent to a repair weld joining a replacement section to the original vessel. These pre-existing cracks initiated in areas of hard microstructure known to be susceptible to hydrogen stress cracking. This hard microstructure formed during the repair welding of the replacement section. The cracks grew through the vessel wall as a result of hydrogen pressure cracking.  Ruptured vessel  When the depth of the largest of these pre-existing cracks exceeded 90% to 95% of the wall thickness, the remaining thin ligament of steel in the cracked section ruptured and leakage occurred. This crack caused a complete fracture of the vessel circumference at the operating stress level of only 35 MPa (roughly 10% of the rated strength of the steel) because the toughness of the vessel steel had been reduced by hydrogen embrittlement.

Mains had been a commercial brownie baker since 1992, and eventually purchased the telephone number 1-800-Brownie. The first theme-park that ordered her brownies for sale in their park placed an order for 37,000 brownies. Eventually, she was baking and selling up to 1.6 million brownies a year. Among her clients, she was the producer for brownies at Disney World since 1994. The first incarnation of Brownie Brittle was called \\"Brownie Crisps,\\" however they did not take off. The idea for brownie brittle and the crisps came from the hardened drippings that would come off the pans used in her plant, and she developed a new type of process that would only produce crispy brownie edges. The company relaunched ‚ÄúBrownie Crisps‚Äù as Brownie Brittle and the renamed product was first sold in retail stores in April 2011.

She was appointed to this position by the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 15 March 2013, and resigned on 22 July 2015, departing on 31 December 2015 after the selection of her successor was announced. Biography Pansieri first joined the United Nations through the United Nations Development Programme in 1983 in China. She later moved on to different positions within the UN system in other countries, including Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Laos where she served as Director of the UN Drug Control Programme, the predecessor of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. She worked in Vienna between 1995 and 1998 and served as Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in New York from 1998 to 2001, when she rejoined UNDP. Between 2001 and 2004, Pansieri headed the Country Operations Division of UNDP overseeing all programming activities in the Arab region, at the point in time when the region started being at the centre of attention following the publication of the UNDP Arab Human Development Report and the 11 September terrorist attacks in the USA. From 2004 to 2008, Pansieri served as United Nations Resident Coordinator and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Yemen. Commenting on the country's development challenges, she said much greater efforts needed to be made to reduce corruption and improve governance mechanisms in order to promote investment in the country. She also described how she was inspired by volunteerism, which she said was essential to achieving development goals. In 2005, she was the first to volunteer as an International Observer for a polio immunization campaign in Yemen. Pansieri went on to serve as Executive Coordinator of the United Nations Volunteers programme (UNV) from 2008 to 2013. At UNV she oversaw the first State of the World‚Äôs Volunteerism Report in 2011. Presenting the report, Pansieri said that volunteers can and do make significant contributions to peace and development, and that there is a clear relationship between volunteerism and societal well-being. She also said that a volunteer‚Äôs engagement ‚Äúis not a condescending act of charity,‚Äù but rather recognition of a reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationship. As the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights from 2013-2015, Pansieri was outspoken on a variety of human rights challenges around the world. In 2013, she returned to Yemen on an official visit amidst the unrest following the stepping-down of the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had been granted immunity. Pansieri called for accelerated efforts to advance transitional justice and national reconciliation measures, saying that the \\"future of Yemen cannot be built on [a foundation of] impunity for past violations - whenever and wherever they occurred.\\" In 2014, Pansieri spoke out against the Cambodian government‚Äôs ban on demonstrations, which she said fell short of \\"the test of legality, necessity and proportionality.‚Äù She also expressed her concern that the overall human rights situation in the country had deteriorated following the 2013 elections, especially in regard to freedom of expression and assembly. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pansieri asserted that it was important for countries to support efforts to uncover the fate of missing persons following armed conflict and war, stating that ‚Äúat the heart of the obligations of States to determine the fate and whereabouts of persons who are unaccounted for is the right to the truth.\\" The absence of such truth, she said, could undermine relationships between communities for generations. In September 2014, speaking at a special session of the Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in Iraq, Pansieri reported that the Islamic State (IS) was believed to have carried out \\"acts of inhumanity on an unimaginable scale\\", and that evidence suggested Iraqi government forces may also have committed human rights violations. She also condemned the persecution of Christians, Yazidis, Turkmen and other ethnic groups by IS forces, saying that IS had \\"ruthlessly carried out what may amount to ethnic and religious cleansing.\\" In 2015, Pansieri presented a report describing the negative impact of the global drug problem on human rights. In an interview about the report with Swedish Television News, she said she was surprised to see that Sweden lagged behind other countries in terms of its drug policies. She went on to defend the report's recommendations, which included decriminalizing drug possession and use, embracing ‚Äúharm reduction‚Äù approaches when dealing with drug dependent persons, and considering the rights of indigenous peoples to follow traditional practices that may involve drug use. She said that to much of the international community, such policies were no longer controversial. Also in 2015, Pansieri made an official visit to Colombia, where she stressed that even after 50 years of war, it was important for Colombians not to give up on the peace process, no matter the obstacles and setbacks that may continue to occur.

Although the UN and Pansieri had a responsibility to follow up these allegations they failed to do so. Pansieri admitted that she had not given the investigation into sexual abuse of children by French peacekeepers the necessary attention. She stated that she had assumed that French authorities were handling the matter, despite repeated requests for additional information from French authorities. No action was taken until Anders Kompass, the Geneva-based UN human rights staffer informed French authorities by transmitting a report to the French Government with covering letter shedding light on the alleged abuses. However, Pansieri responded with a statement demanding the whistleblower's resignation. When Kompass refused to do so, he was suspended.

The tubercle effect is a phenomenon where tubercles or large 'bumps' on the leading edge of an airfoil can improve its aerodynamics. The effect, while already discovered, was analyzed extensively by Frank E. Fish et al in the early 2000 onwards. The tubercle effect works by channeling flow over the airfoil into more narrow streams, creating higher velocities. Another side effect of these channels is the reduction of flow moving over the wingtip and resulting in less parasitic drag due to wingtip vortices. Using computational modeling, it was determined that the presence of tubercles produces a delay in the angle of attack until stall, thereby increasing maximum lift and decreasing drag. Fish first discovered this effect when looking at the fins of humpback whales. These whales are the only known organisms to take advantage of the tubercle effect. It is believed that this effect allows them to be much more maneuverable in the water, allowing for easier capture of prey. The tubercles on their fins allow them to do aquatic maneuvers to catch their prey. The tiny hooklets on the fore edge of an owl's wing have a similar effect that contributes to its aerodynamic maneuverability and stealth. The Science Behind the Effect The tubercle effect is a phenomenon in which tubercles, or large raised bumps on the leading edge of a wing, blade, or sail increase its aerodynamic or hydrodynamic performance. Research on this topic was inspired by the work of marine biologists on the behavior of humpback whales. Despite their large size, these whales are agile and are able to perform rolls and loops underwater. Research on humpback whales indicated that the presence of these tubercles on the leading edge of whale fins reduced stall and increased lift, while reducing noise in the post-stall regime. Researchers were motivated by these positive results to apply these concepts to aircraft wings as well as industrial and wind turbines. Early research on this topic was performed by Watts & Fish followed by further experiments both in water and wind tunnels. Watts & Fish determined that the presence of tubercles on the leading edge of airfoil increased lift by 4.8%. Further numerical computations confirmed this result, and indicated that the presence of tubercles can decrease the effects of drag by 40%. Leading-edge tubercles have been found to reduce the point of maximum lift and increase the region of post-stall lift. In the post-stall regime, foils with tubercles experienced a gradual loss of lift as opposed to foils without tubercles, which experienced a sudden loss of lift. An example of a wing without protuberances compared to a wing with protuberances is shown. The geometry of tubercles must also be considered, as the amplitude and wavelength of tubercles have an effect on flow control. Tubercles can be thought of as small delta wings with a curved apex, since they create a vortex on the upper edge of the tubercle. These vortical structures impose a downward deflection of the airflow (downwash) over the crests of tubercles. This downward deflection delays stall on the airfoil. On the contrary, in the troughs of these structures, there is a net upward deflection of airflow (upwash). Localized upwash is associated with higher angles of attack, which relates to increased lift, as the flow separation occurs in the troughs and stays there. The vortex created by the tubercle delays flow separation toward the trailing edge of the wing, thus reducing the effects of drag. However, in water, due to the crest/trough structure, cavitation is possible, and is undesirable. Cavitation occurs in areas of high flow velocity and low pressure, such as the trough of a tubercled structure. In water, air bubbles or pockets form on the upper side of the tubercle. These bubbles reduce lift and increase drag, while increasing noise in the flow when the bubbles collapse. However, tubercles can be modified to manipulate the location of cavitation. The effect of amplitude of tubercles has a more significant impact on post-stall performance than wavelength. Higher amplitude of tubercles has been linked to more gradual stall and higher post-stall lift, as well as lower pre-stall lift slope. The wavelength and amplitude can both be optimized to increase the post-stall performance. Experiments on the effects of leading-edge tubercles have primarily focused on rigid bodies, and more research is needed in order to apply the knowledge of the tubercle effect to industrial, aircraft, or energy applications. Biological Occurrences of Tubercles Tubercles are a material phenomenon that occurs in multiple organisms. These organisms include the humpback whale, hammerhead sharks, scallops, and chondrichthyans, an extinct aquatic organism. One organism that tubercles are notable in is the humpback whale. The tubercles on humpback whales are located on the leading edge of the flippers. The tubercles allow the very large whales to execute tight turns underwater and swim efficiently; a task imperative for the humpback whales feeding. The tubercles on the flippers help to maintain lift, preventing stall, and decreasing the drag coefficient during turning maneuvers. Tubercles on the humpback whale are considered passive flow control because they are structural. Tubercles develop in the fetus of the humpback whale. Typically 9-11 tubercles are present on each flipper and decrease in size as they near the tip of the flipper. The largest tubercles are the first and forth tubercles from the shoulder of the whale. This anatomical structure is common among large fish species, primarily predatory species on their pectoral fins. Modern Applications in Industry Leading edge tubercles are up and coming in the manufacturing area. Wind turbine performances rely on blade aerodynamics where similar flow characteristics are observed (source # 9) modern turbines have twisted blades to account for the angle of attack at specific design conditions. However, in practical application, turbines often operate at off- design conditions where stall occurs, causing a decrease in performance and efficiency. In order to look for possible improvement of the energy efficiency of turbine, the influence of leading edge tubercles must be investigated in more depth. Tubercles provide a bio-inspired design that offers commercial viability in design of watercraft, aircraft, ventilation fans, and windmills. Control of passive flow through tubercle designs has the advantage of eliminating complex, costly, high-maintenance heavy control mechanisms while improving properties of performance for lifting bodies in air and water. One issue that remains today is the difference in the scale of structure and operation that each of these bio-inspired technologies use. New techniques are being implemented in order to develop methods of delaying stall in flow applications. For example, jet aircraft with leading edge defects can carry greater payloads at faster speeds and higher altitudes, allowing for greater economic efficiency in the aeronautical field. While these effects are found in many aquatic animals and birds, scaling these designs up to industrial application brings forward another set of issues regarding the high stresses associated by machinery. In airplanes for example, designs are much more limited than the complex kinematics and structures of the joints in the wings of birds which produces agile turning maneuvers. This problem can be rectified by further researching into the overlap between size and performance between biological structure and engineering application. It was also observed in turbine design that leading-edge effects have the ability to improve power generation by a factor of up to 20%. In the aeronautical engineering field, leading-edge tubercles placed on turbine blades can increase generation of energy. Blades with tubercles were also found to be effective at generation of power at both high and low wind speeds, meaning that comparing blades with smooth leading edges to those with leading-edge tubercles, the blades with leading-edge tubercles demonstrated enhanced performance. The utility of tubercle in performance improvement of engineering systems comes directly from examination of biological structures. It is important to realize the versatility that creating designs with bio-enhanced properties offers promise into many flow design applications. As these designs become more and more advanced, the application of biomimetric technologies become crucial to the next development of high-performance machinery and equipment as different methods of efficiency are developed through these methods.

Career He started his career as an apothecary in Paris. He served as a physician in the French-Spanish War of 1793. As a physician, he developed the accurate observation of the clinical signs of illness, and studied the unaided auscultation of respiratory and cardiac ailments. He also described tubal breathing and pulmonary rales or crackles. He listened to the heart and focused on problems of the heartbeat and unusual sounds, but he failed to link them to any specific ailment. Shortly after, Ren√© Laennec (1781-1826) invented the stethoscope and developed aided auscultation. He wrote two books and many reports, for example about diseases like croup and cholera. In 1832 he co- founded the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine with Antoine Portal (1742-1832). King Louis Philippe I (1773-1850), who reigned from 1830 to 1848, offered him another peerage should he renounce his medical practise, but he refused. Death He died on 12 June 1842 in Paris, and was buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Legacy His family owns the winery Ch√¢teau de Beaupr√© in Saint-Cannat, started in 1890 by Baron Emile Double (1869-1938).

History  Aqaba has been a major port since the Iron Age. The Bible refers to the area in (1 Kings 9:26): \\"King Solomon also built ships in Ezion-Geber, which is near Eloth in Edom, on the shores of the Red Sea,\\" in which Eloth refers to a port on the grounds of Aqaba. The Aqaba port was particularly important after the Ottomans built the Hejaz railway, which connects the port to Damascus and Medina. Today, the economy of Aqaba is largely based around the port sector. Recently, an Abu Dhabi consortium of companies called Al Maabar has won the bid to relocate and manage the Aqaba port for 30 years and expand the existing ferry terminal which receives about 1.3 million passengers and thousands of trucks and cars coming from across the shore in Egypt.  Relocation  In 2006, the port was relocated from the city's centre to its south, due to a deeper water level there. Another relocation is also scheduled; it would place the port near the southernmost part of the province near the Saudi Arabian border. Its capacity will surpass that of the current port. The project will cost US$5 billion, and it will be completed by 2014.  Aqaba container terminal  Aqaba Container Terminal, location The port contains the Aqaba container terminal (ACT), Jordan's only container port, and the second-busiest facility on the Red Sea by container volume. The ACT is a logistics hub and an important part of the Jordanian economy. It is the primary gateway for the Jordanian market, and a crucial transit point for cargo moving between countries in the region. The ACT is a joint venture between Aqaba Development Corporation and APM Terminals under a 25-year build-operate-transfer agreement that was signed in 2006. A terminal expansion project completed in October 2013 added to the existing quay to create a total quay length of , increasing the annual container throughput capacity to 1.3million TEUs. The expansion program, begun in 2009, has included the delivery of two new ship-to-shore cranes with a 22 container row reach, and four rubber tyred gantry cranes. In 2004, the Aqaba Development Corporation (ADC), on behalf of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA), acquired and took over the management and operation of the terminal. In 2006, a 25-year Joint Development Agreement (JDA) was signed between ADC and ACT. Under this contract, APM Terminals Jordan is responsible for operating, managing and marketing ACT.

The site has now been transformed into Jao Tsung-I Academy under batch 1 of the Hong Kong Government's revitalisation scheme. In the 19th century, the hospital first served as a labourers' dormitory for The Chamber of Mines Labour Importation Agency. In 1912, the British Army set up the Lai Chi Kok Barracks and was stationed there for two years. It became Lai Chi Kok Internment Camp later in 1924. The camp was then closed until the establishment of Stanley Prison in 1937. In the same year, Hong Kong became an epidemic zone under the spread of smallpox. The site was then rebuilt as a hospital for infectious diseases. Those patients from the hospital for leprosy, which was located in Hei Ling Chau and closed in 1974, were sent to the reconstructed hospital. The hospital was later changed to serve long-term psychiatric patients after the number of leprosy patients declined. In the early 2000s, the Hospital Authority planned to send its 400 mental patients to different psychiatric hospitals and transformed the site into a long-term nursing home under the supervision of the Social Welfare Department for patients who were queuing for such service. While the SWD refused to take it over, the HA then set up H.A. Care Limited to manage the hospital. In June 2004, patients were relocated to Caritas Jockey Club Lai King Rehabilitation Centre, which was completed in April 2005, and was the former site of Lai Chi Kok Hospital, which was returned to the SAR government. At that time the site was planned to be reconstructed as the staff dormitory of Correctional Services Department as well as their families. Current situation Lai Chi Kok Hospital became one of seven buildings in the Revitalising Historic Buildings Through Partnership Scheme launched by Development Bureau in 2008. The Hong Kong Cultural Heritage was successfully selected by The Hong Kong Institution for Promotion of Chinese Culture to carry out the project. The site is named Jao Tsung-I Academy promoting Chinese culture education. Phase 1 is open since June 2012 and phase 2 was completed in 2013. Free public access is allowed to the Chinese landscaped gardens, conservation gallery and a heritage gallery. The area is around 32,000 m2 and the building is set up as a cultural hostel with 85 guest rooms. Public review Editorials in Hong Kong commented on the slow revitalisation progress of the architecture. Apple Daily reported the re-denomination of the cultural center. It was named Hong Kong Cultural Legacy Centre (È¶ôÊ∏ØÊñáÂåñÂÇ≥Êâø‰∏≠ÂøÉ), and later was named after the master of national art ‚Äì Jao Tsung-I Academy. Ta Kung Pao reported the delay due to filibuster in May.

A vector is an exterior normal at a point of the closed set if there is a real- valued continuously differentiable function maximized locally at the point with that vector as its derivative at the point. If the closed subset is a smooth submanifold with boundary, the condition states that the vector field should not point outside the subset at boundary points. The generalization to non-smooth subsets is important in the theory of partial differential equations. The theorem had in fact been previously discovered by Mitio Nagumo in 1942 and is also known as the Nagumo theorem. Statement Let F be closed subset of a C2 manifold M and let X be a vector field on M which is Lipschitz continuous. The following conditions are equivalent: *Any integral curve of X starting in F remains in F. * (X(m),v) ‚â§ 0 for any exterior normal vector v at a point m in F. Proof Following , to prove that the first condition implies the second, let c(t) be an integral curve with c(0) = x in F and dc/dt= X(c). Let g have a local maximum on F at x. Then g(c(t)) ‚â§ g (c(0)) for t small and positive. Differentiating, this implies that g '(x)‚ãÖX(x) ‚â§ 0. To prove the reverse implication, since the result is local, it enough to check it in Rn. In that case X locally satisfies a Lipschitz condition :\\\\displaystyle{X(a)-X(b)\\\\le Ca-b.} If F is closed, the distance function D(x) = d(x,F)2 has the following differentiability property: :\\\\displaystyle{D(x+h)=D(x) + \\\\min_{z} 2h\\\\cdot(x-z) + o(h),} where the minimum is taken over the closest points z to x in F. :To check this, let ::\\\\displaystyle{f_\\\\varepsilon(h)=\\\\min_{z} 2h\\\\cdot(x- z),} :where the minimum is taken over z in F such that d(x,z) ‚â§ d(x,F) + Œµ. :Since fŒµ is homogeneous in h and increases uniformly to f0 on any sphere, ::\\\\displaystyle{f_0(h) \\\\ge f_\\\\varepsilon(h) \\\\ge f_0(h) - C(\\\\varepsilon) h,} :with a constant C(Œµ) tending to 0 as Œµ tends to 0. :This differentiability property follows from this because ::\\\\displaystyle{D(x+h) \\\\le x+h-z^2 \\\\le z-x^2 +2h\\\\cdot (x-z) + h^2 =D(x) +f_0(h) +h^2} :and similarly if h ‚â§ Œµ ::\\\\displaystyle{D(x+h) \\\\ge D(x) + f_\\\\varepsilon(h) + h^2.} The differentiability property implies that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\lim{\\\\delta\\\\downarrow 0} {D(c(t+\\\\delta)) - D(c(t))\\\\over \\\\delta} =2\\\\min_z X(c(t))\\\\cdot (c(t)-z),} minimized over closest points z to c(t). For any such z :\\\\displaystyle{2X(c(t))\\\\cdot (c(t)-z)= 2 X(z)\\\\cdot (c(t)-z) - 2(X(z)-X(c(t)))\\\\cdot (c(t)-z).} Since ‚àíy ‚àí c(t)2 has a local maximum on F at y = z, c(t) ‚àí z is an exterior normal vector at z. So the first term on the right hand side is non-negative. The Lipschitz condition for X implies the second term is bounded above by 2C‚ãÖD(c(t)). Thus the derivative from the right of :\\\\displaystyle{e^{-2Ct}D(c(t))} is non-positive, so it is a non-increasing function of t. Thus if c(0) lies in F, D(c(0))=0 and hence D(c(t)) = 0 for t > 0, i.e. c(t) lies in F for t > 0.

Carl Hansen & S√∏n is the company behind many classical furniture designs by leading figures of the Danish modern movement but the company is also collaborating with contemporary designers. Knud Erik Hansen, its current owner and CEO, is the grandson of the founder. History The company was founded by master cabinetmaker Carl Hansen when he opened his first workshop in Odense on 28 October 1908. His first real factory opened in 1915, specializing in bed room furniture for the bourgeoisie and landed gentry on the island of Funen. The global economic crisis which arrived with the 1930s also affected furniture sales in Denmark. It hit Carl Hansen hard and in 1934 his second-oldest son, Holger Hansen, took over the business after his father. A contract with the American sewing machine manufacturer Singer for the production of wooden cases for some of their models helped the company through the difficult times. Hansen Jr. also set up a small-scale export of furniture to Sweden. Working constructs Hans Wegner's CH33 chair at factory in 1958 In the years after World War II, a new generation of young Danish furniture designers such as Finn Juhl, Hans J. Wegner and B√∏rge Mogensen. Carl Hansen & S√∏n as the company was now called entered into a collaboration with the salesman Ejvind Kold Christensen who had an eye for the new trends. In 1949, he set up a meeting between Wegner and Holger Hansen which resulted in a lasting collaboration between the two parties. Instead of just promoting their furniture to retailers, the company also began a comprehensive exhibition and advertisement activity targeted on end consumers. In the early 1950s, modern Danish furniture design also began to attract attention abroad and especially in the US. Together with four other manufacturers of Wegner furniture, Carl Hansen & S√∏n established a joint sales company, Salesco, which was responsible for exhibitions and marketing abroad, including on the furniture fairs in Cologne. The Y Chair was a particularly big success for Hansen & S√∏n, accounting for more than half of its sales. In 1968, a failed exclusivity agreement with a dealer put a temporary end to the success on the US market. The 1970s and 1980s were generally difficult times for Hansen & S√∏n. In 1988, Holger Hansen's son, cabinetmaker J√∏rgen Gerner Hansen, took over the company. He invested in new machines. The early 1990s brought a renewed interest in Danish furniture classics and a Japanese subsidiary was established in 1991. Carl Hansen & S√∏n relaunched several retired Wegner designs. In 2001, Carl Hansen & S√∏n purchased Tranek√¶r Furniture, another high-end furniture manufacturer, located at the Tranekj√¶r estate on the neighbouring island of Langeland. The company's former logo. Active from the mid-1980s to 2014. In the mid-1980s, the company commissioned Bernt Petersen to design new logo featuring a white C within a blue square. In 2002, J√∏rgen Gerners' brother, Knud Erik Hansen, acquired all shares in the company. He built a new factory in Aarup and internationalized the organization, leading to an increase in export from 20% in 1998 to over 50% in 2008. In 2011, Carl Hansen & S√∏n took over the highend Rud. Rasmussen furniture workshop in Copenhagen, notable for its production of furniture by Mogens Koch and Kaare Klint. An attempt to incorporate luxury products in the product portfolio failed and in 2016 Carl Hansen & S√∏n abolished Rud. Rasmussen as an independent brand and all employees are dismissed. in 2014, Carl Hansen & S√∏n returned to their earlier logo designed by Hans Wegner in 1950. The release of the restored logo coincide with the 100-year anniversary of Wegner's birthday. This replaced the logo created by Bernt Petersen. Designers Carl Hansen & S√∏n is the manufacturer of many classical furniture designs from the period now known as Danish Modern by designers such as Hans J. Wegner, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Ole Wanscher, B√∏rge Mogensen and Poul Kj√¶rholm. The company has also collaborated with contemporary designers such as Tadao Ando, EOOS, Naja Utzon Popov, Anker Bak and Brad Ascalon.

She married Tom Liljegren in 1960, and they had three children, Kathryn, Michael, and Patti. After twenty years of marriage, they divorced. Her second husband, Alec Azure, died after only two and a half years of marriage. Through her grief, Azure devoted more of her time to writing. Before she began writing, Azure worked for the United Way, starting as a volunteer in 1975, then as a professional in 1979. Except for a four-year period from mid-1990 to 1994, she remained a community planner in various local United Ways until her retirement January 2006. She currently lives in Maryville, Illinois. Discovering her ancestry Azure was, for a long time, unclear about her familial roots, and did not know to which tribe she descended from. After searching for 35 years, she wrote a memoir, Along Came A Spider, about her life and the struggles she went through to discover her ancestry. After years of research, Azure claims to have discovered many of her old ancestors during a visit to Nova Scotia . Azure is a member of Association des Acadiens Metis-Sourquois (salt water people), a controversialhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/the-controversial- rise-of-the-eastern-metis-where-were-these-people-all-this-time-1.4680105 social group located in Saulnierville, Digby County, Nova Scotia.

Targeting Yugoslav and Serb forces nearby NATO bombed the prison on May 19 and May 21, 1999. On May 22, Serbian security forces lined up the approximately 1,000 prisoners in the courtyard and fired on them with snipers, machine guns, and grenades from the prison walls and guard towers, killing at least seventy people. At least another twelve prisoners were killed over the next twenty-four hours as prison guards, special police, and possibly paramilitaries attacked prisoners who were hiding in the prison's destroyed buildings, basements, and sewers. The injured were taken away in trucks, while the remaining prisoners were transported to Lipjan prison, where they were beaten. On June 10, they were transferred and held in prisons in Serbia after the war had ended. Consistency of witness testimony, with specific details about times and locations, leaves no doubt that Serbian and possibly Yugoslav government forces deliberately and without need killed a substantial number of ethnic Albanians in the prison. Background Dubrava prison was Kosovo's largest detention facility. Located a few miles east of Istok in north-western Kosovo (Dukagjini region), near the frontier with Montenegro, the prison had three pavilions with a capacity of more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates were suspected KLA and common criminals. As with all of Kosovo's detention facilities, credible reports of torture and abuse emanated from Dubrava prison throughout 1998 and early 1999. Defense lawyers reported restricted access to their clients in Dubrava, and the Kosovo Verification Mission was never allowed access to the prison. There were many complaints of torture and beatings from people held in this prison. Injuries ranged from broken bones to permanent kidney failure. It is believed that at least four or five men died as a result of beatings sustained while they were detained at the prison between October 1998 and March 1999. A witness told HRW prison guards beat the prisoners every day once the NATO bombing began. One former prisoner transferred to Dubrava on April 30, said that approximately 165 ethnic Albanians from Gjakova were brought to Dubrava a short time after he had arrived. This was confirmed during the April‚ÄìMay 2000 trial in Ni≈° of 143 Albanians arrested in Gjakova in May 1999, who testified that they had been transferred from Gjakova to prisons in Peƒá, Lipljan, and Dubrava. Among the ethnic Albanians in Dubrava was one of Kosovo's most prominent political prisoners, Ukshin Hoti, who was finishing the last year of a five-year sentence. Three witnesses said that Hoti was released from Dubrava on 16 May because his sentence expired. His current whereabouts, however, are unknown, and many former prisoners and human rights activists fear that he is dead. Witnesses before International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have testified that Yugoslav army tanks and anti-aircraft cannons had been placed round the jail, which in April were hit by NATO aircraft. Some former prisoners claim that they saw anti-aircraft fire coming from near the prison during the NATO bombing. NATO bombings NATO bombed what it claimed to be Yugoslav Army and Serbian police forces near the prison at 1:15 p.m. on 19 May killing four and wounding two civilians. The prisoners spent the next two nights sleeping outside, but within the walls of the prison. On 21 May, prison guards ordered the prisoners to line up in the courtyard, however, the process was interrupted when NATO planes flew over. Initially, the NATO claimed that the prison was a military barracks. The next day, Tanjug (state news agency for FR Yugoslavia) reported 19 prisoners and guards killed and more than ten wounded. The victims of the bombings, at least 23, were KLA members. The Yugoslav government claimed 85 civilian deaths, while HRW determined ca. 18 deaths. Another source stated that 95 were killed and 196 injured. Executions Inmates were extrajudicially killed or summary executed on 22 and 23 May. Witnesses before ICTY stated that on the early morning of 22 May 1999 the prisoners were told to line up on the sports field, with the explanation that they were to be transferred to other more secure prisons. About 800 prisoners obeyed while the rest hid themselves in the jail. After the prisoners formed a line, police started firing from the guard tower and the jail walls, using hand grenades, bazookas and automatic weapons. The witnesses said about 20 officers opened fire. What ensued was total chaos with prisoners falling down all over the place. Witness testimony with details of times and locations indicates that government forces executed a substantial number of ethnic Albanians in the prison. Other witnesses testified that on the fateful day prison officials ordered the approximately 1,000 prisoners to line up in the prison yard. After a few minutes, they were fired upon from the prison walls and guard towers with machine guns and grenades, killing at least seventy people. Another number is 67. Over the next twenty-four hours, prison guards, special police, and possibly paramilitaries attacked prisoners who were hiding in the prison's buildings, basements, and sewers, killing at least another twelve inmates. In 2011 the Republic of Kosovo Member of Parliament and witness to the massacre Nait Hasani stated: A witness told Human Rights Watch: Another recalled: Chaos ensued as prisoners ran for cover in the various buildings of the prison, their basements, or the prison's sewer system. That evening, all of the witnesses say, a group of special police or paramilitaries entered the prison and tried to reassert control. The assault lasted approximately twenty minutes, during which time hand grenades were thrown into the school building, allegedly killing at least two people. The prisoners remained hidden during the night, some of them preparing to defend themselves with makeshift weapons made from broken furniture or garden tools. The wounded numbering about 120 to 150 were placed in the Pavilion C basement. The following morning of May 23, the witnesses said, new soldiers or paramilitary units came to the jail, opened the drains and threw in hand grenades. That day four people went crazy and hanged themselves in their cells. A witness told Human Rights Watch: Later in the morning, the security forces had reasserted some control over the prison, and they issued an ultimatum for the prisoners to emerge from their hiding places within fifteen minutes. With no other options, the prisoners revealed themselves, and were then gathered in the prison's sports hall, which was still undamaged. According to the witnesses, Yugoslav Army soldiers were present this time. The injured were taken away in trucks, while the remaining prisoners were transported in approximately ten buses to Lipljan prison in south-central Kosovo. All of the former prisoners claimed to have been beaten in Lipjan. All of the ethnic Albanian prisoners in Lipljan were transferred to prisons in Central Serbia. The Yugoslav government claimed NATO bombs had killed 95 inmates and injured 196. As the prisoners got on buses, the police counted those missing. It came to 154, witnesses stated. Jacky Rowland, a BBC journalist who was escorted by the Yugoslav government to the prison, testified before the ICTY seeing a prison room in with about 25 bodies piled up in one place. In addition to the fact that there was no visible damage from bombing in that room, Rowland was \\"especially disturbed\\" by the fact that the corpses had their trousers pulled down to the ankles, so that their underwear was visible, ruling out death due to blast effect. Aftermath Since all of the survivors of the massacre were transferred to prisons in Central Serbia after the attack, accounts of the killings did not emerge until after the war when some of the prisoners were released. In June 1999, Spanish NATO troops discovered one body in the prison, who had been lying there at least one month, his throat was cut. On 13 August, a Spanish forensic team began exhuming 97 graves that were found near Dubrava prison. A legal advisor to the ICTY, Karl Koenig, stated that the bodies appeared to have been there since 26 or 27 May. In her 10 November 1999 report to the U.N. Security Council, ICTY chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said that 97 bodies had been found at the Rakosh site. A New York Times reporter who visited the prison in November 1999 witnessed: \\"basements of the buildings, the blood lies still sticky on the floor, bullet holes scar the walls, and impact marks of grenade explosions crater the floors.\\". Perpetrators The Serbian police in Istok were under the jurisdiction of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs (SUP) in Peƒá, which covered the municipalities of Peƒá, Klina, and Istok. The commander of the Peƒá SUP during the war was Col. Boro Vlahoviƒá. Journalist Paul Watson, who visited Dubrava on 19 May and 21 May quoted one official from the prison, Aleksandar Rakoƒçeviƒá, whom he identified as a warden. Two former prisoners who spoke with Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that the director of the prison was known as \\"Miki\\", a dark-skinned man who spoke perfect Albanian. According to a witness, the deputy director was known as \\"Ace\\" and he was the one who allegedly gave the order to fire on the assembled prisoners on May 22. Albanian prisoners that spoke to HRW claimed that the prison guards had released and armed some of the ethnic Serbian prisoners after the first NATO raid on May 19. Both witnesses said they saw some of these people back in the prison attacking the Albanians with whom they had, until recently, been incarcerated. Another former Dubrava prisoner, Kosovo MP Uk√´ Tha√ßi, is convinced that the Dubrava killings were an \\"organized massacre through prison staff, police and army ... it was a Serbian state planning ..., because Serbian police and army were located within the prison facilities.\\" The fact that the Peƒá SUP, which after the war had been moved to Serbia, compiled a report on the killing of prisoners in the Dubrava prison three years after the event, was interpreted by the ICTY prosecutor as having the purpose to help the defense of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá.

History Entrance graves date to the later Neolithic era and Bronze Age (c.2500-1000 BC). Circular in shape, most entrance graves were built with a mound of heaped rubble and soil, typically up to 82 feet (25m) in diameter. The perimeter of the mound was marked with kerbstone. It held a rectangular chamber built of stone slabs or coursed rubble stone, or a combination of the two. The chamber roof was made of stone slabs, called capstones. Access to the chamber was through an opening in the mound's kerb or outer edge. Brane barrow was first discovered by William Copeland Borlase in 1863 while he was exploring an underground structure, probably Carn Euny, a short distance away. Borlase refers to the structure as the barrow near Chapel Euny, because of its location near the village of Chapel Euny. The farmer who owned the site told Borlase that he did not destroy the barrow because it was provided a good shelter for sheep and pigs. Description Drawing of barrow by William Borlase, 1872 Brane Barrow is a scheduled burial monument located 317 yards (290m) south west of Brane End Farm, and 1.2 miles (2 km) southwest of the village of Sancreed, in Cornwall. The monument includes an entrance grave, situated in a low-lying pasture close to the upper Lamorna River. The barrow is a circular mound of earth and stones, measuring up to 20 feet (6.1m) in diameter. The mound is surrounded and retained by a border of large granite blocks. It contains a rectangular stone-lined chamber measuring 7.5 ft (2.3m) long by 4 ft (1.2m) wide and 3 ft (0.9m) high. The chamber is roofed with two capstones: a third capstone was removed at some point. On the southeast is an entrance passage that leads directly into the chamber. It is unusual that the mound was constructed to just barely cover the chamber. The mound is damaged on the south side where the earth has been removed to expose the chamber.HUT BARROW, Pastscape, retrieved 21 May 2013 The burial monument can be visited with permission at Brane farm.

It was introduced by R. Barsoum in 1976. Technique In this method, the usual isoparametric 6 node triangular or 8 node isoparametric quadrilateral elements are employed. The mid side nodes on 2 adjacent sides are shifted towards the corner node to the quarter point location. For these locations of the mid nodes, the Jacobian becomes singular at the corner node thus making displacement derivatives infinite and stresses and strains become infinite as well. It can be shown that the variation of stresses along the 2 sides of the elements is according to . On the other hand, if all the three nodes on the side of an 8 node quadrilateral element are collapsed to one node (given the same node number) then the stress or strain varies as along any radial line emanating from crack tip. All the mid side nodes adjacent to the crack tip are at quarter point locations. From the displacement field solution the stress intensity factor K1 in a mode 1 case can be calculated as per the following relation: K_1 = \\\\frac{2\\\\mu\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}(4V_B-V_C)}{(k+1)\\\\sqrt{L}} where VB and VC are the displacement in the y direction behind the crack tip. It has been demonstrated that K1 found by this method is within 2% of theoretical solutions. Accuracy of finite element calculation can be improved if the neighboring elements are also modeled to have the terms depicting the stresses for a crack with its tip outside the element.

A weaving shed is a distinctive type of single storey mill developed in the early 1800s in Lancashire, :Derbyshire and Yorkshire to accommodate the new power looms weaving cotton, silk, woollen and worsted. A weaving shed can be a stand-alone mill, or a component of a combined mill. Power looms cause severe vibrations requiring them to be located on a solid ground floor. In the case of cotton, the weaving shed needs to remain moist. Maximum daylight is achieved, by the sawtooth \\"north-facing roof lights\\". History The early textile trade relied on domestic outworking. Handloom weavers would take the yarn to their cottage loom shops, and return the completed fabric to the mill. Reliable power looms that could be worked from an overhead line shaft were not available before Kenworthy and Bulloughs weft stop motion, the roller temple and the loose reed which appeared in the 1840s. The first weaving floors were on the ground floor of the existing narrow mills, where the workpiece was lit by tall exterior windows. The weaving shed appeared around this time. They initially adjoined existing mills, and then were built as standalone mills by speculating investors or by industrial cooperatives of former handloom weavers. Either group would run the looms themselves or operate the shed as a room and power mill. Here as the name suggests, space was rented to other companies who could specialise in weaving with out the skills needed to finance, build and maintain a building. Weaving sheds were cheap to build and fireproof having no wooden beams. They were also safer, because their north- facing roof windows meant they were not as dependent on gas-lighting as were spinning mills. Function The purpose of a weaving shed was to provide spaces for rows and rows of identical looms. A standard shed would house 1200 looms, and it was common to think in multiples of 400 looms. These looms would be tentered by weavers who worked from four to eight looms each and were paid on piece-rate. The looms would be maintained by a skilled tackler who would be on hand to gait the looms and effect instant repairs or adjustments. There would be four tacklers for 400 looms. The looms were powered by leather belts from overhead cross-shafts, on bevel gears from the line shaft that ran the length of the shed. Attached to the weaving shed in a typical mill would be a boiler house where the steam was raised, an engine room housing a stationary steam engine and a two or three-storey building where the preparatory processes were done below and above would be the warehouse. This also housed the offices. Weaving was not possible without a continuous supply of weft on pirns, and beams carrying the warp. Starting with the warp, it had to be warped from creels of thread, in a multistage process onto the weavers' beam. This could be done in the mill or the warp could be bought in and delivered on the tapers beam. The beam of thread had to be sized in a tape sizing machine by sizers. Each thread had to pass through the correct eye in the heddle, and through the reed. This was done on a drawing-in frame by loomers. The beam, heddles and reed would be carried through into the weaving-shed and gaited to the loom by the tackler.s The pirns used for the weft in the shuttles were wound by a pirner, on a pirning machine in the shed or be bought shuttle ready from the spinners. The completed pieces would be cut off the loom, (it was on a takeup beam), and this left the shed to go back to the warehouse where it would be examined for faults by the cloth looker, and if it was of satisfactory quality, folded and forwarded to the client. The payroll and paper work was done by office staff. File:Queen Street Mill Sizing 5372.JPGTape sizing machine Construction The weaving sheds were simple working industrial buildings and the external materials generally used in their construction are robust and there was little in the way of ornamentation. External walls were generally in coursed rubble, stone or brick. The few openings or windows were in simple detailed timber joinery. Internal materials comprised stone flag floors, exposed cast iron structure, timber joinery and boarded partitions and lime plaster on lath soffits to the south facing roof slopes. The sheds were often built into the hillside so the wall would benefit from contact with damp earth that would maintain the moisture levels in the shed required by cotton weaving. The shed would be modular using a 3m by 6m bay, the beams of the roof being supported by cast iron columns. The ground to beam clearance was 3.5m and the ground to ridge height was 4.6m. Later sheds used a longitudinal beam under the gutter beam eliminating the need for a row of columns, creating a 6m by 6m lattice. The modular nature enable sheds to infill on irregularly shaped sites. The south- facing common slate roofs at Bankfield Shed, Barnoldswick Queen Street Mill, Harle Syke The north light roofs to the majority of weaving sheds were constructed with simple 30-degree pitched roofs, comprising a simple structure of common rafters with slate roof coverings facing south and glazed lights to the north. The cast iron beams that support these rows of north lights are ingeniously designed as inverted channel sections such that they both carry the load of the roofs and act as rainwater gutters. The rainwater would exit to identical drainpipes on the east and west exterior walls. The gutter beams were laid flat with joints aligned over column heads. The end of each gutter section has an external flange enabling sections to be bolted together over a bracket to the head of the column. The brackets were designed to collect any resulting leak at the joint and channelled it down the inside of the hollow columns. Cast iron tie rods running from the columnheads, at right angles to the gutterbeams, gave lateral rigidity. The columns were the mounting points for the lineshaft bearings. Regional Variations Though the North Light Roof Shed predominated in Lancashire and Yorkshire, there were always variations caused by local needs. In Brazil in the southern hemisphere the south lit roof was more appropriate. Domed vault were used in Leeds, United Kingdom and Issenheim, France but were expensive to build and were dark. Flat roofs on vaults with monitor lights were chosen in Italy, parts of the United States and India because they helped to reduce the heat. Brick vaulting was used in Catalunya, and in settlements that were short of land, two-storey building were erected with the weaving below and the spinning above. Similar two-storey mills were built in 1865 in Angus, Scotland. At Salts Mill in Bradford and in Dundee the power was from below rather than above giving greater headroom while the lace mills of Nottingham and the woollen tweed mills in Roxburghshire had higher rooves to allow for overhead supervision gantries. The Tonnendach mills of central and northern Europe, used a curved broad span with raised transverse rooflights, a system patented by Sequin- Brunner of Switzerland in 1885. Wrought-iron lattice trusses were favoured in France after 1870, while in Ireland the curved light timber Belfast truss was used by Barbour Threads in Hilden, Ulster. Restoration and reuse By the 1980s the final weaving companies were woven out (closed), and in a few cases the mills were mothballed. Most however had already been converted for alternative use- and in 2010 a report was written detailing possible ways that the weaving sheds could be renovated and put to alternative uses. The challenge lies in having 1000m¬≤ of top lit shed with no exterior windows, having structural columns every 3.6m. There are successful schemes which convert the shed into covered parking, and divided retail space, offices and business start up units. When part of the centre is opened up to form an inner court, the bays round the edge have been converted into a primary school, residential units and student accommodation.

Taxonomy Eleven named species are within the genus Pegivirus. Isolates belonging to the species Pegivirus C are monophyletic and show < 50% nucleotide (55% amino acid) sequence divergence between aligned sequences from the polyprotein from each other. However, all differ by >50% nucleotide (>55% amino acid) divergence from other members of this genus. Pegiviruses assigned to this species (Pegivirus A) originate from primate host species (humans, chimpanzees and several New World monkey species). The sequence U22303 has been assigned as the type member of the species, as this was the first pegivirus to be described for this species. Terminology to describe viruses with different hosts has not been approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses; however, Pegivirus A viruses have been called HPgV for human pegivirus, SPgV for new world simian pegiviruses, and SPgVcpz for chimpanzee simian virus. A second species within the pegiviruses is termed Pegivirus B. Only one virus was included in the naming proposal, which was a complete genome of a virus found in the bat species Pteropus giganteus.

It stands on Mulfra Hill to the north of the hamlet of Mulfra. Location The Quoit is located west of Penzance between Porthmeor and New Mill on the top of Mulfra Hill, from where you can look to the sea over the surrounding hills. Structure Mulfra Quoit is similar to Ch√ªn Quoit five kilometers away. The quoit has three 1.7m-high support stones, arranged in a U-shape 3.0m long and 1.7m wide, and open on one side. The capstone, which has slipped down, measures 3.2m by 3.0m, and is almost square; it has a weight of 5 tonnes. Since some of the stones that formed the chamber are missing, it is difficult to get an idea of its original form, but it is possible that four pillars supported the capstone slab as with Ch√ªn Quoit. On the other hand, the capstone has a central bulge on its underside, which would give the stone a stable position on the existing three pillars. Mulfra Quoit was apparently covered by a mound, the remnants of which are still present Research View and floor plan of the Mulfra quoit - Drawing by William Borlase, 1769 In 1769 the antiquarian, William Borlase published a plan and a drawing of the quoit and described a 60 cm-high stone embankment, which encircled the dolmen with a diameter of 12m, of which, nothing can be seen today. Borlase also mentioned a further stone, which he thought was part of the capstone, but this stone no longer exists. The ground was covered with a 30 cm-thick soil, which Borlase thought was part of the original mound.William Borlase, (1769), Antiquities Historical and Monumental of the County of Cornwall, Bowyer and Nichols, London In 1872 his descendant William Copeland Borlase examined an accumulation of stone in the centre of the dolmen, and undertook excavations which only yielded charred wood. W. C. Borlase refuted a local story that the dolmen had been damaged by a lightning strike in 1752, because his ancestor in 1749, had found it in much the same state as it is today.William Copeland Borlase, (1872), Naenia Cornubiae, Longmans Due to its poor state of conservation later writers gave it scant attention: Hencken in 1932 compared it to Ch√ªn Quoit and simply called it \\"a very similar but less perfect chamber.\\"Hugh O'Neill Hencken, (1932), The Archaeology of Cornwall and Scilly, Metheun In 1950 Glyn Daniel did little more than mention the name of the quoit and classified it as a \\"typical rectangular\\" chamber, although he did provide a plan of the structure.Glyn Edmund Daniel, (1950), The Prehistoric Chamber Tombs of England and Wales, Cambridge University Press Notes External links Category:Dolmens in Cornwall Category:Archaeological sites in Cornwall Category:Penwith ","title":"Mulfra Quoit"},{"id":"39082665","text":"Eupithecia tsushimensis is a moth in the family Geometridae.

At the by-election, Childers beat his Conservative challenger, Walter George Hepburne-Scott, 9th Lord Polwarth, taking 70% of the poll.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p499 Before being selected for Edinburgh South, Childers had been MP for Pontefract in the West Riding of Yorkshire since 1860 F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1832-1885; Macmillan Press, 1977 pp242 but had lost the seat narrowly at the 1885 general election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p170 Childers also had a distinguished government career behind him by 1886 having been, amongst other posts he held, First Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for War and Chancellor of the Exchequer in previous Liberal administrations.William Carr, revised H C G Matthew, Hugh Culling Eardley Childers; in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-13 The writ for the by-election was moved in Parliament on 4 February by Arnold Morley, who went on to be the new government‚Äôs Chief Whip, along with a number of writs for other seats involving newly appointed ministers in Gladstone's third administration.

The two burial monuments, (Upper and Lower Innisidgen) lie on a steep slope of Innisidgen Hill overlooking Crow Sound with a view towards the Eastern Isles. Innisidgen Hill Innisidgen Hill is a scheduled monument on the Isles of Scilly, north east of Hugh Town, the largest village on the Island of St. Mary's. It is the site of two Bronze Age entrance graves that overlook Crow Sound and the Eastern Isles in Scilly. Innisidgen Hill is located near the small settlement of Trenowieh. The larger burial chamber, generally referred to as \\"Upper Innisidgen\\", is perched on top of Innisidgen Hill. The smaller grave, \\"Lower Inisigen\\", is located on the lower northern slope of the hill. The burial monument also includes an archeological site dating to the English Civil War. Lower Innisidgen Lower Innisidgen lies near the bottom of the northern slope of Innisidgen Hill. This grave is more damaged than the upper grave and has only two of its original capstones. Parts of the surrounding kerb of the mound remain, while the mound itself incorporates small outcroppings of rock. This entrance grave consists of a circular mound of earth and rubble, 8.5m in diameter and 1.7m in height. Inside the mound is a central chamber, 5.4m long 1.3m wide, and 1m high. The entrance to the chamber is on the south side of the mound and faces north. The walls of the burial space are lined with coursed rubble. There is a large stone positioned at the northern end of the chamber and large slabs edge the central and northern parts of the east wall. Two capstones provide a roof to the central and southern parts of the chamber. During an unauthorized excavation in 1950, the chamber was emptied of its existing earth and rubble. Upper Innisidgen Upper entrance grave at Innisdgen Upper Innisidgen, also known as \\"The Giant's Grave\\", is one of the best preserved entrance graves on Scilly. The entrance grave consists of a slightly oblong mound of earth and rubble measuring 9m by 8m, and is 1.8m in height. The mound's surrounding kerb is approximately 1 metres high on its north side. There are remnants of an outer platform, up to 2m wide. The grave's upper surface is composed of turf. The mound covers an intact burial chamber with an entrance at the eastern side of the mound. The entrance is covered by a large stone slab. The rectangular chamber is 4.6m long and approximately 1.5m wide and 1.2m high. The chamber walls are lined with large slabs. Along the north- northeast wall, are coursed smaller slabs and rubble. The west-northwest end of the chamber is blocked by a large edge-set slab. Five large slabs make up the roof of the burial chamber. The roof slabs are slightly exposed in the grassy surface of the mound. History The Isles of Scilly were originally settled during the Neolithic era, circa 2500 BC. Burial monuments on the islands range in date from the later Neolithic period to the Middle Bronze Age (c.2500-1000 BC). Entrance graves are distinguished by their burial chamber, typically constructed with edge-set slabs, coursed rubble walling or both, and roofed by large covering slabs. The chamber is usually accessible through an opening in the mound's stone outer edge. Excavations of entrance graves have generally uncovered cremation urns, pottery fragments and cremated and unburnt human bones. The two entrance graves at Innisidgen Hill were built during the Bronze Age. At the time of construction, the burial chambers overlooked a coastal inlet, later known as Crow Sound. During the prehistoric era, this site would have encompassed a wide valley of fields enclosed by stone walls. The remains of a prehistoric field system are located on the northern slope of Innisidgen hill next to the entrance graves, discernible as earth and piles of rubble. No artefacts or human remains were found when both graves were first excavated in 1854.

Callahan was recruited out of college by future NFL general manager Bobby Beathard and signed a contract with the Falcons one month later. Callahan played wide receiver at Temple University for the 1966, 1967, and 1968 football teamsg under head coach George Makris. Prior to enrollment at Temple University, Callahan earned first team All-Catholic League honors at Cardinal Dougherty High School. Callahan scored a touchdown the first 10 times he touched the football in intercollegiate play, leading the New York Times to report facetiously that \\"Jim Callahan of Temple is in a slump\\" after the 11th reception of his career did not go for a touchdown. When his college career ended, Callahan held Temple Owls football records for most career points (218), most points in a season (86 in 1968), most points in a game (30 verses Bucknell University in 1966), most career touchdowns (36), most touchdowns in a season (14 in 1968), most career receptions (105), most receptions in a season (57 in 1968), most career receiving yards (1,848), most receiving yards in a season (786 in 1968), and most career receiving touchdowns (36). Callahan also was on the receiving end of the longest pass play in Temple history; a 90-yard pass thrown by quarterback John Waller against Northeastern University in 1968. His five touchdown receptions against Bucknell in 1966, the most touchdown receptions for one game in Temple history, helped the Owls defeat Bucknell for the first time in 12 years.

Biography  Menalton Braff was born in Taquara, a Brazilian municipality in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. His formal education occurred in both Taquara and Porto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul and one of the top cultural, political and economic centers of the country. He became interested in literature during his childhood, when he began reading classical authors. He engaged in political activism during his course of Economy in the former Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul and was forced to quit University and disappear as a citizen for a few years due to the military coup of 1964. It was only after amnesty that Braff could use his real name again. In S√£o Paulo, at Universidade S√£o Judas Tadeu, Braff started his teaching career. At this time, while finishing a postgraduate course in Brazilian literature, Braff wrote his first novel. His first two books were published under the pen name Salvador dos Passos, which was abandoned in 1999 when he published √Ä Sombra do Cipreste. This short stories book would win the Pr√™mio Jabuti for Literature in 2000. He worked as a teacher and professor of Brazilian literature in Catanduva, Batatais, Ribeir√£o Preto, Ituverava and other regional cities. Braff married Roseli Deienno, who studied at the same University where he worked in S√£o Paulo, and they moved to the interior of the State. Braff was the winner of Pr√™mio Jabuti de Literatura in 2000 with √Ä Sombra do Cipreste.  Literary style  Braff‚Äôs prose is best known for its literary impressionism and tendencies for lyrical or poetic narratives. In an interview, the author himself acknowledges: ‚ÄúMy general tendency is for Impressionism. I feel deeply attracted to the paintings of the movement, its suggestion, its unfinished aspect; that is, a world in constant construction.‚Äù (BELEBONI, 2007).Tra√ßos impressionistas nos contos de Menalton Braff In this sense, his works generally offer moments of impressions that compose experience instead of focusing on a realist image of a whole. His narrators prefer to suggest sensations and thus take part in an attempt to capture the moment, the fragmentary, the subjective. Stream of consciousness, for instance, is one of the techniques employed to highlight the ideas of disconnection and linear rupture. Braff‚Äôs literary inclination to the lyrical novel is based structurally on rhythmic patterns such as rhymes and alliteration. On the thematic and plot spheres, his narratives focus mainly the human condition through the projection of the inner life of either the narrator or the characters as well as the search for identity and existential meaning. In addition, some works briefly draw attention to the social and historical aspect of fiction, such as O Casar√£o da Rua do Ros√°rio (2012), a novel related to the Brazilian military government.

He was recruited by several top college programs and chose to accept a scholarship to play for coach Charley Pell at the University of Florida. Peace became the Gators' starting quarterback just five games into his freshman season of 1980 when a knee injury to starter Bob Hewko propelled the rookie into the lineup, and he performed well enough to keep the starting job for most of the next three and a half seasons. Over his career at Florida, Peace lead the Gators to a 28-12-1 record, four bowl games, and their first ever top-10 ranking in the final AP Poll (No. 6 in 1983). He set several individual records as well; his career completion percentage (61.6%) was a school record and his 7,206 passing yards were second in school history when he graduated. During his junior season in 1982, Peace set an NCAA record for completion percentage (70.7%) which was broken by Steve Young the following year.

At the top of the hill is a causewayed enclosure, a form of Neolithic earthwork which began to appear in England from about 3700 BC onwards, characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways. It is not known what they were used for; they may have been settlements, or meeting places, or ritual sites of some kind. The site has been scheduled as an ancient monument. Knap Hill is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified: in 1908 and 1909, Benjamin and Maud Cunnington spent two summers investigating the site and Maud Cunnington published two reports of their work, noting that there were several gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure. In the late 1920s, after the excavation of Windmill Hill and other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period. About a thousand causewayed enclosures have now been found in Europe, including around seventy in Britain. The site was excavated again in 1961 by Graham Connah, who kept thorough stratigraphic documentation. In 2011, the Gathering Time project published an analysis of radiocarbon dates from almost forty British causewayed enclosures, including several new dates from Connah's finds. The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC. Two barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it. The hilltop also contains the remains of a Romano-British settlement on an adjoining smaller area called the plateau enclosure, along with some evidence of occupation in the 17th century. An Anglo-Saxon sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.  Background  The main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a causewayed enclosure,Oswald et al. (2001), pp. 156‚Äì157. a form of earthwork which began to appear in England in the early Neolithic, from about 3700 BC.Oswald et al. (2001), p. 3. (Both the causewayed enclosure and the hill itself are referred to as Knap Hill.) Causewayed enclosures are areas that are fully or partially enclosed by segmented ditches (that is, ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground), often with earthworks and palisades in some combination. The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate, and many suggestions have been made by researchers. They were previously known as \\"causewayed camps\\", since it was thought they were used as settlements: early investigators suggested that the inhabitants lived in the ditches, but this idea was later abandoned in favour of any settlement being within the enclosure boundaries.Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), p. 5.Oswald et al. (2001), p. 9. In a 1912 report on an excavation at Knap Hill it was assumed that the ramparts were a form of defence.Cunnington (1912), p.48. The causeways were difficult to explain in military terms, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force;Curwen (1930), p. 50. evidence of attacks at some sites provided support for the idea that the enclosures were fortified settlements. They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery, and if they were a focus for the local people, they may have been evidence of a local hierarchy with a tribal chief. There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10‚Äì11. They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.Andersen (2019), p. 807. In 1930, the archaeologist Cecil Curwen identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.Curwen (1930).Oswald et al. (2001), p. 25. Excavations at five of these had already confirmed them as Neolithic, and another four of Curwen's sites are now agreed to be Neolithic. A few more were found over the succeeding decades,Oswald et al. (2001), p. 31. and the list of known sites was significantly expanded with the use of aerial photography in the 1960s and early 1970s.Mercer (1990), pp. 10‚Äì12. The earlier sites were mostly found on chalk uplands, but many of the ones discovered from the air were on lower- lying ground. Over seventy are known in the British Isles, and they are one of the most common types of early Neolithic site in western Europe, with about a thousand known in all.Andersen (2019), p. 796. They began to appear at different times in different parts of Europe: the dates range from before 4000 BC in northern France, to shortly before 3000 BC in northern Germany, Denmark and Poland. The enclosures in southern Britain and Ireland began to appear not long before 3700 BC, and continued to be built for at least 200 years. In a few cases enclosures that had already been built continued to be used as late as 3300 to 3200 BC.Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 1‚Äì2.  Site  Knap Hill Knap Hill is in Wiltshire, about a mile (1.6 km) north of the village of Alton Priors. It is part of the chalk hills that form the northern rim of the Vale of Pewsey, and is flanked by Golden Ball Hill to the east, and Walker Hill to the west. Golden Ball Hill has traces of Mesolithic activity,Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), p. 97. and two other Neolithic sites are nearby: Adam's Grave, a chambered long barrow on Walker Hill, and Rybury, a causewayed enclosure, further west. The south side of the hill is the steepest, with more gradual slopes to the north and west. A narrow neck of land connects it to Golden Ball Hill to the east.Cunnington (1912), p. 42. At one time there were two round barrows inside the enclosure; one of these was destroyed in the 19th century by flint diggers. A third barrow lies just outside the causewayed enclosure, to the southwest, and a fourth barrow may also have existed to the south, though the records that refer to it may be a confused reference to the third barrow.Connah (1965), p.22, note 7. The Neolithic causewayed enclosure at the top of Knap Hill consists of a ditch, and a bank inside it, that run along the northwestern edge of the hilltop, and extend partway down the southwestern and northeastern sides, with some of the bank extending past the ditch at the northeastern edge.Cunnington (1912), pp. 43‚Äì45. Both the ditch and bank were built in seven segments, with six gaps, or causeways, between them. Another short section of ditch at the eastern corner of the hill was divided into two sections,Cunnington (1912), p. 47. but no ditch or bank has yet been found along the southern edge of the hilltop. Knap Hill is unusual in that the gaps in the ditch correspond exactly to those in the bank; in most sites there were at least three times as many gaps in the ditch as in the bank.Oswald et al. (2001), p. 43. The area of the enclosure is about . To the northeast of the enclosure lies a smaller archaeological site known as the plateau enclosure,Cunnington (1912), p. 49. which dates from before and during the Romano-British occupation.Cunnington (1912), pp. 57‚Äì58. The plateau enclosure was also occupied in the 1600s, perhaps by shepherds. A bank, with a ditch on either side, runs from the southeastern corner of the causewayed enclosure down the hill, which is too steep for this to have been a pathway.Cunnington (1912), pp. 45‚Äì46.Connah (1965), p. 2. Similarly, from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge, a bank runs down the hill, this time with only one parallel ditch.Connah (1965), pp. 9‚Äì10. Both were probably boundary ditches. Knap Hill is an example of an upland-oriented enclosure: it is on a prominent hill, which makes it a dramatic location when viewed from the south, but the land on which the enclosure is constructed tilts towards the upland to the north of the hill. Several other upland enclosures are similarly situated, and this is probably not by chance. Whitesheet Hill, Combe Hill and Rybury are other examples of enclosures that are hard to identify when seen from the lower ground below them, but which are much more visible viewed from the neighbouring uplands.Oswald et al. (2001), pp. 99‚Äì102. The archaeologist Roger Mercer considered Knap Hill to be \\"the most striking of all causewayed enclosures\\", and recommended viewing it from the road to the west that runs from Marlborough to Alton Priors.Mercer (1990), p. 66. The site has been scheduled as an ancient monument.  Antiquarian and archaeological investigations  Knap Hill was first mentioned as being of antiquarian interest in 1680, by John Aubrey, who described it as \\"a small Roman camp above Alton\\".Mercer (1990), p. 20. Richard Colt Hoare mentioned Knap Hill early in the 19th century, noting \\"two small barrows, and another on the outside\\".Quoted in Thurnam (1860), p. 326.  John Thurman, 1850s  John Thurnam investigated the barrows between 1853 and 1857, but found the easternmost of the two barrows within the enclosure had been destroyed by flint diggers, with no trace left. The western barrow was about high, with a small ditch around it. Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \\"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow. He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves. Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, deep and across. It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.Thurnam (1860), pp. 326‚Äì327.Cunnington (1912), p. 43.  Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908‚Äì1909  The Neolithic enclosure was first excavated by Maud and Benjamin Cunnington, in the summers of 1908 and 1909. The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal Man in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:Cunnington (1909), pp. 49‚Äì52. > Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature > which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved > in prehistoric fortifications in Britain... There are six openings or gaps > through the rampart. It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were > due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes... > Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the > result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually > part of the original construction of the camp... Outside of, and > corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid > gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case... > Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight > inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when > apparently they so weaken the whole construction... It has been > suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there > is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional > feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the > gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any > suggestion on the subject would be welcomed. alt=planThis was the first time that causewayed ditches had been identified,Connah (1965), p. 1. though earlier excavations had taken place at sites now known to be causewayed enclosures.Andersen (2019), p. 795. By the time the second summer's work had been completed, every causeway had been excavated sufficiently to prove that the ditches ended where they appeared to from what could be seen of them above ground.Cunnington (1912), p. 59. Maud Cunnington described the excavation in a 1912 paper. She and Benjamin excavated a long stretch of one of the ditches, and discovered that the width and depth varied greatly, from deep and wide at the bottom at the west end of the section, to deep and only wide at the bottom at the east end. They also made cuttings along the southern edge of the hilltop to determine if a ditch existed there which was no longer visible on the surface, and found two short ditch sections at the eastern corner (marked S‚ÄìS on the plan).Cunnington (1912), pp. 59‚Äì60. Most of the relics obtained from the ditches were found in clusters, and were usually within of the bottom; they included some sherds of pottery, flint flakes and burnt flints, fragments of animal bones, and pieces of sarsen stone. The only human bone found was a small jaw bone with worn teeth.Cunnington (1912), pp. 60‚Äì61. The pottery was coarse, with flint inclusions, and was found associated with flint flakes, leading Maud Cunnington to suggest that the people who used the pottery may have been Neolithic, though she concluded that the inability to tell undecorated pottery of the Bronze Age and Neolithic periods apart meant that it was not possible to confidently assign a period.Cunnington (1912), p. 50.Cunnington (1912), pp. 56‚Äì57. The Cunningtons found several flint-knapping clusters, including one group of seventy-two flint chips deep in the ditch.Cunnington (1912), pp. 61‚Äì62.Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 97‚Äì98. The discovery of a second enclosure, to the northeast of the original target of their excavation, complicated the Cunningtons' work. To distinguish it from the \\"Old Camp\\", the new enclosure was labelled the \\"Plateau Enclosure\\" in Maud Cunnington's published paper. It was clear to Cunnington that the plateau enclosure was much more recent than the old enclosure, since the plateau enclosure's southwestern ditch was dug through the old enclosure's ditch, which had silted up almost completely by that time. Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to have been constructed no earlier than the early Iron Age. The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; the Cunningtons cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path. A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for‚Äîan entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point. The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included bead-rim pottery which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.Cunnington (1912), pp. 50‚Äì51. Anglo-Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons Within the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end. The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that Maud Cunnington dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, each marked P. on the plan. These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about deep, and in diameter. These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.Cunnington (1912), pp. 51‚Äì53. A 6th-century Anglo-Saxon iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound (at G on the plan). A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman. Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais); this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a quern, damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery. Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a violent end to the inhabitation of the enclosure. Section through the ditch at cutting A-A in the 1908‚Äì1909 excavation. Between the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), , with walls made of blocks of chalk. Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy. The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the sherds at different levels. The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the walls and under the foundations. It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but the Cunningtons found no other evidence that would help determine its date.Cunnington (1912), pp. 55‚Äì56. The Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \\"Grinsell 10\\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down. It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Maud Cunnington speculated that the body had been buried so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals. The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.Cunnington (1912), pp. 58‚Äì59. Two low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge. The one to the east was known locally as \\"The Devil's Trackway\\". The northwestern bank led for towards an old track across the hill.  C.W. Phillips, 1939  In 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a bowl barrow outside the enclosure, but never published a report. Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by Leslie Grinsell, published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13. Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s. Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds might have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed. Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.  Graham Connah, 1961  alt=plan In 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by Graham Connah. Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.Connah (1965), pp. 2‚Äì3. Like the Cunningtons, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings. Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912. Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint inclusions, but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least away. Similar combinations of finds had been reported at Windmill Hill, Robin Hood's Ball, and Whitesheet Hill.Connah (1965), p. 11. Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as Windmill Hill ware, a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.Pouncett (2008), p. 37. In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of Beaker ware were found;Connah (1965), p. 12‚Äì14. Connah suggested they may have come from visits to the hill top, rather than an occupation.Connah (1965), p. 22. Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four Samian sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD. Some later medieval pottery fragments were found in the upper layers of the cuttings, all of which may have originally been part of a single vessel. These sherds could not be accurately dated. In one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch. Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them. Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman- British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.Connah (1965), p. 7. The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about tall. She suffered from osteoarthritis, and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \\"most probably suffered agonies\\".Connah (1965). pp. 18‚Äì19. Connah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of one of the causeways (marked \\"iv\\" on his plan) found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank. None of these ditches had been noticed by the Cunningtons. Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.  Gathering Time, 2011  In 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using Bayesian analysis. Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project. Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again. Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good association with the building of the enclosure. The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC. The researchers concluded that it was likely that the site was in use for \\"a short duration, probably ...well under a century, and perhaps only a generation or two\\".

He finds it boring and repetitive as his Granny always feeds him cabbage-related dishes, most commonly cabbage soup and cabbage chocolate, and they are constantly playing Scrabble, plus her television hasn't been working since the 1990s. Ben loves plumbing and is a long-term subscriber to the magazine Plumbing Weekly, which he buys every week from Raj's news-agency. Ben's parents disapprove of him being a plumber, as their ambition for their only child was to be a professional ballet dancer like the one they used to watch every Friday. One day, Ben calls his parents at Granny's house and asks them to take him home. Mum and Dad ignore Ben and disapprove of the proposal. Granny somehow overhears the conversation due to the indistinct sound made by Ben while he was talking. The next morning, his Granny seems somewhat upset and disappointed thinking that her grandson doesn't love her. That same morning, Ben is served boiled eggs by Granny, which Ben doesn't like and he flicks the runny egg gloop onto the window; But as he was hungry he starts searching for something to eat; with some pocket left luck, he finds a box of chocolate biscuits.

Synnefo manages multiple Google Ganeti clusters at the backend that handle low-level VM operations and uses Archipelago to unify cloud storage. To boost 3rd-party compatibility, Synnefo exposes the OpenStack APIs to users. Synnefo is being developed by GRNET (Greek Research and Technology Network), and is powering two of its public cloud services, the service, which is aimed towards the Greek academic community, and the service, which is open for all members of the G√âANT network. History In November 2006, in an effort to provide advanced cloud services for the Greek academic and research community, GRNET decides to launch a cloud storage service, similar to Amazon's S3, called Pithos. The project is outsourced and opens for public beta to the members of the Greek academic and research community in May 2009. In June 2010, GRNET decides the next step in this course; to create a complete, AWS-like cloud service (Compute/Network/Volume/Image/Storage). This service, called ~okeanos, aims to provide the Greek academic and research community with access to a virtualized infrastructure that various projects can take advantage of, e.g. experiments, simulations and labs. Given the non- ephemeral nature of the resources that the service provides, the need arises for persistent cloud servers. In search for a solution, in October 2010 GRNET decides to base the service on Google Ganeti and to design and implement all missing parts in-house. In May 2011, the older Pithos service is rewritten from scratch in-house, with the intention of being integrated to ~okeanos as its storage service. Moreover, the new Pithos adds support for Dropbox-like syncing. In July 2011, ~okeanos reaches its public alpha stage. This version (v0.5.2.1) includes the Identity, Compute, Network and a primitive Image service. The alpha release of the new, rewritten Pithos follows shortly after, in November 2011. It is marketed as Pithos+ and the old Pithos remains as a separate service. The new Pithos+, though not integrated to ~okeanos yet, provides syncing and sharing capabilities for files, as well as native syncing clients for Mac OS X, iPhone, iPad and Windows. In March 2012, ~okeanos enters the public alpha2 phase. This version (v0.9) includes a complete integration of the new Pithos as part of ~okeanos and now acts as the unified store for Images and Files. Around this point, in April 2012, the ~okeanos team decides to refer to the whole software stack as Synnefo and starts writing the first version of the Synnefo documentation. In December 2012, due to interest from other parties to the Synnefo stack, GRNET decides to conceptually separate the ~okeanos and Synnefo projects. Synnefo starts to become a branding-neutral, IaaS cloud computing software, while ~okeanos becomes its real-world application, an IaaS for the Greek academic and research community. In April 2013, a new Synnefo version (v.013) gets released after a huge cleanup and code refactoring. All separate components are merged under the single Synnefo repository. This is the first release as a unified project, containing all parts (Compute/Network/Volume/Image/Storage). In Jun 2013, Synnefo v0.14 gets released. Since this version, Synnefo is branding neutral (all remaining ~okeanos references are removed). It also gets a branding mechanism and the corresponding documentation, so that others can adapt it to their branding identity. Overview Synnefo has been designed to be deployed in any environment Components Synnefo is modular in nature and consists of the following components: Astakos (Identity/Account services) Astakos is the Identity management component which provides a common user base to the rest of Synnefo. Astakos handles user creation, user groups, resource accounting, quotas, projects, and issues authentication tokens used across the infrastructure. It supports multiple authentication methods: Pithos (File/Object Storage services) Pithos is the Object/File Storage component of Synnefo. Users upload files on Pithos using either the Web UI, the command- line client, or native syncing clients. It is a thin layer mapping user-files to content-addressable blocks which are then stored on a storage backend. Files are split in blocks of fixed size, which are hashed independently to create a unique identifier for each block, so each file is represented by a sequence of block names (a hashmap). This way, Pithos provides deduplication of file data; blocks shared among files are only stored once. The current implementation uses 4MB blocks hashed with SHA256. Content-based addressing also enables efficient two-way file syncing that can be used by all Pithos clients (e.g. the kamaki command-line client or the native Windows/Mac OS clients). Whenever someone wishes to upload an updated version of a file, the client hashes all blocks of the file and then requests the server to create a new version for this block sequence. The server will return an error reply with a list of the missing blocks. The client may then upload each block one by one, and retry file creation. Similarly, whenever a file has been changed on the server, the client can ask for its list of blocks and only download the modified ones. Pithos runs at the cloud layer and exposes the OpenStack Object Storage API to the outside world, with custom extensions for syncing. Any client speaking to OpenStack Swift can also be used to store objects in a Pithos deployment. The process of mapping user files to hashed objects is independent from the actual storage backend, which is selectable by the administrator using pluggable drivers. Currently, Pithos has drivers for two storage backends: * files on a shared filesystem, e.g., NFS, Lustre, GPFS or GlusterFS * objects on a Ceph/RADOS cluster. Whatever the storage backend, it is responsible for storing objects reliably, without any connection to the cloud APIs or to the hashing operations. Cyclades (Compute/Network/Image/Volume services) Cyclades is the Synnefo component that implements the Compute, Network, Image and Volume services. It exposes the associated OpenStack REST APIs: OpenStack Compute, Network, Glance and soon also Cinder. Cyclades is the part which manages multiple Ganeti clusters at the backend. Cyclades issues commands to a Ganeti cluster using Ganeti's Remote API (RAPI). The administrator can expand the infrastructure dynamically by adding new Ganeti clusters to reach datacenter scale. Cyclades knows nothing about low-level VM management operations, e.g., handling of VM creations, migrations among physical nodes, and handling of node downtimes; the design and implementation of the end-user API is orthogonal to VM handling at the backend. There are two distinct, asynchronous paths in the interaction between Synnefo and Ganeti. The effect path is activated in response to a user request; Cyclades issues VM control commands to Ganeti over RAPI. The update path is triggered whenever the state of a VM changes, due to Synnefo- or administrator-initiated actions happening at the Ganeti level. In the update path, we monitor Ganeti's job queue to produce notifications to the rest of the Synnefo infrastructure over a message queue. Users have full control over their VMs: they can create new ones, start them, shutdown, reboot, and destroy them. For the configuration of their VMs they can select number of CPUs, size of RAM and system disk, and operating system from pre-defined Images including popular Linux distros (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Gentoo, Archlinux, OpenSuse), MS-Windows Server 2008 R2 and 2012 as well as FreeBSD. The REST API for VM management, being OpenStack compatible, can interoperate with 3rd party tools and client libraries. The Cyclades UI is written in Javascript/jQuery and runs entirely on the client side for maximum responsiveness. It is just another API client; all UI operations happen with asynchronous calls over the API. The networking functionality includes dual IPv4/IPv6 connectivity for each VM, easy, platform-provided firewalling either through an array of pre- configured firewall profiles, or through a roll-your-own firewall inside the VM. Users may create multiple private, virtual L2 networks, so that they construct arbitrary network topologie, e.g., to deploy VMs in multi-tier configurations. The networking functionality is exported all the way from the backend to the API and the UI.

The lake covers . Built by the Bhosle kings of Nagpur, the lake is known for its coloured fountains. In the evenings the site is illuminated with halogen lights and Tanga (carriage) rides. The lake is surrounded on three sides by forest and a landscaped beach on the fourth side. Beautification of Futala Lake In the western area of Nagpur, ancient Futala Lake has existed for 200 years. In the absence of maintenance, the use of this prehistoric lake was limited to cattle washing only. It was therefore decided in 2003 to beautify this lake from NIT funds with equal aid from the state government.Tanga (carriage) at Futala Lake The work was done in two stages. Desilting was done on large scale along with the removal of lotus plants and other waste from the lake. The work included repairing the eastern guard wall of the lake, construction of a pathway with granite stone paving, widening of an 18 m wide road under I.R.D.P., roadside guard wall and landscaping berms, parking and garden bays on the other side of the road, and fixing decorative lamp, benches, attractive dust bins, etc. For watering of plants and landscaping, a sprinkler system was provided. For sufficient lighting with four high masts were fixed in the vicinity of the lake. Two coloured fountains and a white 100 feet fountain were set up in the lake. The work of Immersion Ghat with three ramps on the south side and guard wall of the lake with sand beach on the north side was also done in the first phase. In the second phase of beautification, road berms were cleaned and interlocking paving blocks were fixed on the road from Hanuman Temple to Futala Lake and surrounding triangular land in front of the Temple. About 1300m road was paved under this to solve the grave parking problem raised due to the famous Hanuman temple and beautification done. The area has become the most attractive spot in Nagpur City and, on average, 1,000 visitors visit the lake daily. Much work is still to be done including the construction of the hill steps, sand beach paving on the platform, Nana-Nani park, etc. on the south side of the lake. Also, a water pond and garden are to be developed on a triangular plot opposite Hanuman Temple. The cost of the project is about 45,000,000.

He escaped from Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour with four other convicts and he later confessed to murdering three of his companions and resorting to cannibalism. He and the other survivor Matthew MacAvoy were hanged in Hobart for their crimes. Early life Edward Broughton was born in Dorking in 1803, and had run away from home when he was eleven. He earned his living by petty thieving and later became a highway robber using violence. In 1822 he was convicted of house breaking and served two years in Guildford Gaol. Another conviction for house breaking and he was transported to Van Diemans Land on board the Earl St Vincent in 1826. After being in the Colony for about 10 days he again started his criminal enterprise. He was caught stealing a blanket at Sandy Bay and was sentenced to the penal establishment at Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour. 3 September 1830 five men ran away from the settlement, Richard Hutchinson, William Coventry, Patrick Fagan, Mathew Macavoy, and Broughton, and that they were upwards of thirty days before the two survivors surrendered themselves at Macguire's Marsh near Osterley. Trial and sentencing The two survivors concocted the story that after running for six days they left Hutchison and Coventry behind after the men couldn't swim across a river. They later came across some hostile blacks and Fagan got speared. They were subsequently found guilty of being illegally at large, and were ordered for execution, the judge before whom they were tried, in passing sentence, exhorting them to repentance if their, consciences were burdened with murder, which there was much reason to fear was the case, with reference to their unfortunate companions. Confession The day before execution Broughton burden with guilt made this confession, \\"The first man we murdered was Hutchinson, we were nearly starving at the time, and we drew lots who should kill him; Hutchinson was asleep: the lot fell upon me, and I killed him with an axe, which we brought with us. He was cut to pieces, and with the exception of the intestines, hands, feet and head, the body was carried with us. We lived somedays on his flesh; we ate it heartily- I do not know how many days it lasted. After having thus committed murder, we began to be afraid of each other; one night I awoke Fagan, and told him to watch while I slept, and I would watch while he slept, for I feared that I should be murdered; we each of us feared, that on going to sleep we should be dispatched by the others. One night, as Coventry was cutting wood, we other three agreed to kill him; he was an old man of nearly sixty. I refused to do it as I said they ought to kill him among them, so we might all be in the same trouble. Fagan struck the old man the first blow with the axe; Coventry saw him coming, and cried out for mercy; he struck him just above the eye, but did not kill him - Macavoy and myself finished him and cut him in pieces. We lived upon his body for some days; we were not starving when we killed Coventry' we had only consumed the remains of Hutchinson the same day. We were not at all sparring of the food we obtained from the bodies of our companions: we eat it as if we had abundance- if we had been sparing of it, the one would have been sufficient for us. We now became daily more afraid of each other. Before we had consumed Coventry's body, Macavoy one night started up from the fire, and asked me to go down with him into the bush to see if we could find a kangaroo track, that we might set a snare for. When leaving the fire, Macavoy said, \\"Bring the axe with you.\\" When we had gone about 300 yards, Macavoy laid down and asked me to stop and sit down. I was afraid; I thought he wanted to take away my life, and he was stronger than me. I then threw the axe further from him than from myself, so that if he attempted to take it, I thought I could get it before him. He did not offer to touch it, he then said, \\"there are three of us, Fagan is young and foolish, people will frighten him; and he will tell what has been done, now the only thing that we can do to pre- vent it is to kill him.\\"' I said l would not agree to it, that I knew him better than he did, and was acquainted with his ways and that he would not tell. I could trust my life in his hands. Macavoy said that he was sure he would tell, he would be frightened, as there was three of us, he would turn evidence as to these murders, to save his own life, and we should be hanged ; when there are only you and I together, we could not turn evidence against each other, we can say that we left them at Gordon's River, at the back of the Frenchman's Cap, because they could not swim over it, and then it would be supposed that they had lost themselves and perished in the bush, and then we should perhaps be sent to Norfolk Island. I replied that Fagan was a very good swimmer, and that he was known to be so as well as myself, and they would also know that I would not go away and leave him. We then returned to the fire and agreed not to kill him. When we went back he was lying down by the fire, his shoes were off, and his feet were towards the fire, he was warming them. I then threw the axe down, and he looked up and said, have you put any snares down Ned? I said no, I have not put any down, there are snares enough if you but know it. I sat by him; Macavoy sat beyond me, he was on my right hand, and Fagan on my left. I was wishing to tell Fagan what had passed, but could not, as Macavoy was sitting with the axe close to him, looking at us. Then I lay down, and was in a doze, when I heard Fagan scream out; i leaped up on my feet in a dreadful fright and saw Fagan lying on his back with a dreadful cut in his head, and the blood pouring from it; Macavoy was standing over him with the axe in his hand. I cried to Macavoy you murdering rascal, you blood-thirsty wretch, what have you done? He said this will save our lives, and then he struck him another blow on the head with the axe. Fagan then groaned, and Macavoy cut his throat with a razor through the windpipe. We then began to strip Fagin, we stripped him naked. Fagan had on a red shirt, which I had stolen from Bradshaw at the Settlement, and which occasioned words and ill-feeling between Macavoy and myself, as to whom should become possessed of it; Fagan had also a red comforter and cap, which I likewise stole from Bradshaw, and gave him. I robbed Bradshaw of all I could lay my hands on, I left him not a mouthful of food when I came away. Bradshaw had always been very kind to me, and gave me anything in his power: But I have endeavored to kill him by making a tree fall upon him on account of his being a Constable, and getting people flogged. Fagan's body we cut up into pieces, and roasted it; we roasted all but the hands, feet, and head; we roasted all at once, upon all occasions, as it was lighter to carry, and would keep longer, and not be so easily discovered. About two days after Fagan's murder, we heard some dogs, they had caught a kangaroo, and the dogs were wild. We got the kangaroo, and threw away the remainder of the body. Two days after this we gave ourselves up. I wish this statement to be made public after my death that it may serve as a warning!\\" See also *List of convicts transported to Australia * Hells Gates * Convicts on the West Coast of Tasmania References Category:1803 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Bushrangers Category:People executed for murder Category:People executed by Australian Colonies by hanging Category:People from Tasmania Category:Australian cannibals Category:Western Tasmania Category:Australian serial killers Category:Executed serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Convict escapees in Australia ","title":"Edward Broughton"},{"id":"39083342","text":"24-Epibrassinolide is a type of brassinosteroid, a natural occurring plant hormone.

The term is not sharply definable because many tax related laws influence buyer behaviour which is not always a wanted effect (compensation reaction). The Pigovian tax is a special case of a steering tax to avoid negative Externality. An ecological tax reform is often understood to refer to the introduction of a steering tax on energy use, according to the Polluter pays principle.Ren√© L. Frey, (2007). \\"Grundz√ºge eines ressourcenoptimalen Steuersystems f√ºr die Schweiz - Lenkungsabgaben\\" Umwelt-Wissen Nr. 0710. Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications ‚Äì Bundesamt f√ºr Umwelt (Nummer UW-0710-D), Bern. (35 pages, German text, abstracts in English, French and Italien). In other languages incentive taxes (or fees) are known as \\"de:Lenkungsabgabe\\" or \\"Lenkungs- Steuer\\" (Switzerland). Some of the eco-taxes (\\"√ñkosteuer\\") in Germany and Austria are also steering taxes, in the sense of the originally intended Eco- social market economy. The vehicle Excise Duty in Germany is an example of a steering tax. It is formulated in such a way that there is an incentive to invest in a new car which is as low polluting as possible. Cars with larger pollutant emissions pay a high tax compared to less polluting cars. Electric cars are tax free.\\"Kraftfahrzeugsteuergesetz ¬ß 3d\\", vehicle Excise Duty in Germany (German language). In Germany and Switzerland it is legally clarified that the tax revenues should be used to promulgate, or \\"steer\\", the targeted behaviour change. The increase of earnings may be as long secondary aim as the rule has an objective earning relevance. This means that the tax may be as long be valid as a tax earning can be expected to take place and therefore the steering effect is justified. If the aim of steering the payer's behaviour is successful, this means that the aim to increase tax revenues will be unsuccessful. The yield of tax revenue is reduced if the tax payers behave in the targeted way. For example, the consumption of cigarettes was quickly significantly reduced in Germany in 2004 by the increase of the tobacco tax.  Redistribution of steering taxes to consumers and economy  There are also steering taxes like the de:Swiss VOC-fee (Incentive Tax on Volatile Organic Compounds), The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation (12 November 1997). \\"Incentive Tax on Volatile Organic Compounds\\", SR 814.018, status 1 January 2012.\\"Incentive Tax on Volatile Organic Compounds\\", United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). which will be completely distributed amongst the population.\\"Distribution of VOC-Tax-Revenues to the Swiss population\\", Art. 23 of SR 814.018, The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation. In this case there is no aim to increase tax revenues at all. The ideal goal of such a refund is the creation of positive incentives: People will be rewarded when they behave in the wanted way. If, for example they reduce the emission of greenhouse gases or environmentally dangerous pollutants and reduce their Ecological footprint, they get back an ecological bonus (German: √ñkobonus), because with the consumption of non-taxed environmentally friendly products, they pay less eco-taxes than the Green- Cheque is per capita: The amount of the eco-bonus is independent from the energy consumption of the individual recipients. In the words of a publication of the European Environment Agency: ‚ÄúA Swiss study (INFRAS/ECOPLAN, 1998), which investigated the economic and social impacts of different energy tax schemes, showed that redistributing revenues in the form of a per capita bonus is the most progressive option for an Environmental-tax-reform and creates the most beneficial social effects, although it leads to slightly negative effects on economic development.‚Äù\\"Environmental tax reform in Europe: implications for income distribution\\", European Environment Agency, Technical report No 16/2011, (retrieved 13 June 2013). The repayment of steering taxes is often named fiscal subsidy. If this is accurate depends if one believes a steering tax is used solely as a direct transfer of public funds to private persons, or if they are seen as a relinquishment of state earnings to realize Fiscal neutrality for this market-based environmental policy instrument. The official wording of the German federal government for such a revenue abstinence is \\"subsidy related matters of fact\\". \\"19. Subventionsbericht der Bundesregierung\\", Bundestagsdrucksache 15/1536 (PDF; 2,6 MB), S. 16) (German). ‚ÄúThe recycling [or redistribution of steering tax-] revenues is especially important for the acceptability, and equity of the tax reforms.‚Äù But a difficulty for the political system is, that Opinion polls have shown that the redistribution aspect of eco-taxes ‚Äúis very poorly understood by a large majority of the population.‚Äú  See also  * Carbon fee and dividend * Ecotax * Carbon tax#Switzerland  References  Category:Ecotax Category:Subsidies ","title":"Steering tax"},{"id":"39083389","text":"J√°nos Kende (born 22 September 1941) is a Hungarian cinematographer.

The tomb was partially excavated in the early nineteenth century, and was found to contain human bones and several pottery fragments. Description The chambered long barrow is located near the village of Abbotsbury, in Dorset, England. It is situated at the head of a dry valley in the parish of Long Bredy. The monument is part of a group of similar monuments spread across the South Dorset Ridgeway. The remains of another tomb, the Hell Stone, is 2 km to the east; while the Kingston Russell Stone Circle is around 1 km to the northwest. The Grey Mare and her Colts is accessible using an Ordnance Survey map. The burial monument today is a nearly rectangular mound, 24 m long, 1 m high, and tapering in width from 13 m wide at the southeast end of the tomb to 8 m wide at the northwest end. The remnants of the burial chamber are located at the southeast end of the mound.Daniel, Glyn (1950), The Prehistoric Chamber Tombs of England and Wales, page 93. Cambridge University Press. To the south east end of the mound are four enormous Sarsen stones, three standing and one lying flat. Another horizontal slab behind the tomb is believed to be the capstone of the collapsed burial chamber. There are several small upright stones positioned at the perimeter of the mound. Evidence suggests that these stones are the remnants of the barrow's retaining kerb. History The Grey Mare tomb Long barrowed megalithic tombs are burial monuments built during the Early and Middle Neolithic periods (3400-2400 BC). They can be identified as mounds of stone or earth and typically hold one or more wood or stone-lined burial chambers. They can be up to 90 m long. They represent the burial places of Britain's early farming communities. Over 300 chambered tombs have been recorded in Britain. An excellent example of a chambered long barrow is West Kennet Long Barrow in Wiltshire. The Grey Mare and her Colts burial monument was partially excavated in the early nineteenth century. It was found to contain human bones and several pottery fragments.

Hummel's chief collaborators were Dr. Tu Lien-che (ÊùúËÅØÂñÜ) and Dr. Fang Chao-ying (ÊàøÂÖÜÊ•π), Chinese scholars who were married to each other. The two volumes in 1103 pages comprise some 800 biographical sketches on leading figures of the Qing dynasty (Ch'ing) (1636‚Äì1912) in China. The articles cover Han Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, and other Inner Asian figures, as well as some Europeans. Each article includes a short list of sources and secondary scholarship.

Crossley is also author of the historiographical preface to the new pinyin edition of the work, Eminent Chinese of the Qing Period , published in 2018 by Berkshire . History of the project Hummel, who had developed his Chinese language skills while a missionary in China, was Chairman of the Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Studies of the American Council of Learned Societies from 1930 to 1934. He worked with Mortimer Graves, Executive Director of the Council, to plan a biographical dictionary of the Qing, and gained financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation. Plans were put into action when Hummel joined the Library of Congress in 1934. A younger colleague recalled that Hummel's concern with clarity and precision led him to read the entire text of ECCP aloud to search for better language.Edwin G. Beal and Janet F. Beal, \\"Obituary: Arthur W. Hummel (1884-1975),\\" The Journal of Asian Studies 35.2 (1976): 270. The printer for the volume did not know Chinese. Dr. Tu compiled a master file of every Chinese character in the text. These characters were then cast in Hong Kong, one for each time a character appeared. The characters were then placed in individual wooden frames and numbered by Dr. Tu. The printer put them one by one into the typesetter by hand. The ECCP is nonetheless nearly free of errors.

McNary played college football at the United States Military Academy, and signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent in 2013. High school career McNary played football at Clear Lake High School in Houston. Going into his senior season the Falcons were short of defensive lineman and McNary was a backup strong safety. With the defensive line coach, Michael Boone, looking for athletic players to fill the positions that were open, he asked to work with McNary and converted him to nose guard. McNary was an all-district selection for the nose guard position. Even though he led the team in sacks, he was not offered any scholarships because he only played defensive line for one season and lacked the ideal size for the college level. College career McNary finished his career as Army's all-time leader in sacks (28.0) and tackles for loss (49), while adding 195 tackles (117 solo), nine passes defensed, five forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. He is the only player in school history to record two double-digit sack seasons, and also held school records for the most sacks in a single game (4.0) and a single season (12.5). As a senior in 2010, McNary capped off his career by returning a fumble 55 yards for a touchdown in the Black Knights‚Äô 16‚Äì14 victory over SMU in the Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl. The win gave Army its first winning season since 1996 and first postseason victory since the 1985 Peach Bowl. McNary was one of five finalists for the 2010 Burlsworth Trophy, which honors the most-outstanding college football player who began his career as a walk-on. He was also on the preseason watch lists for the 2010 Lombardi and Nagurski awards, and was a semifinalist for the 2010 Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is presented to the nation's top defensive player. Following his senior year, McNary was honored with the 2011 East-West Shrine Game Pat Tillman Award, given to the player who best exemplifies character, intelligence, sportsmanship, and service. To Conclude his tenure at West Point Mcnary Graduated being one of the best Linebackers to ever play at the Academy. Professional career Indianapolis Colts McNary served two years of active military service and on April 10, 2013, the Indianapolis Colts signed him to a free-agent contract. McNary was placed on the Reserve/Military List but on July 30, 2013 was moved to the active roster and joined the team in training camp.http://www.colts.com/news/article-1/McNARY-TO-DON- BLUE/45f08f49-ad2e-4c41-a030-49cd2dc787e8 McNary did not survive 53-man roster cuts to start the season, but immediately returned to the team, being signed to Indianapolis' practice squad. That is where McNary would stay for 12 weeks. During the beginning of the week before the Colts' Week 13 matchup with division rival Tennessee, McNary was elevated for the first time to the Colts' active 53-man roster. On September 6, 2015, McNary was signed to the Colts' practice squad. He appeared in 13 games for the Colts in 2015 before being placed on injured reserve on December 29. Jacksonville Jaguars On March 16, 2017, McNary signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was released on September 2, 2017. Criminal accusations On January 14, 2015, McNary was charged with one count of rape, one count of criminal confinement and one count of battery, according to court documents filed by the Marion county prosecutor. The alleged incident happened on or around December 1, 2014, after McNary met the accuser at a bar in downtown Indianapolis. The accuser took McNary's phone from his apartment on the way out, and police were able to unlock it after obtaining a search warrant, revealing the identity of McNary. McNary was found not guilty of all charges on September 3, 2015.

He was known for his work in the Hypocreales (Ascomycota), particularly Hypomyces, a genus of fungi that parasitize other fungi. After receiving his doctorate from Cornell University in 1950, he went on to join the faculty of Kansas State University. In 1958, he became a curator at The New York Botanical Garden, and served as editor for various academic journals published by the Garden. Rogerson was involved with the Mycological Society of America, serving in various positions, including President in 1969. He was Managing Editor (1958‚Äì89) and Editor-in-chief (1960‚Äì65) of the scientific journal Mycologia.  Biography  C.T. Rogerson was born on October 2, 1918, in Ogden, Utah, to parents Elijah Knapp Rogerson (1899‚Äì1956) and Mable Crissie Clarke Rogerson (1897‚Äì1987). Upon graduating from high school in 1936, he enrolled in Weber Junior College (since renamed to Weber State University) for the following two years. Rogerson then attended Utah State University, where he had hoped to work under the supervision of botanist Bassett Maguire, but settled instead for the only available studentship with plant pathologist B.L. Richards. Rogerson received his bachelor of science from Utah State University in 1940. Soon after, he was drafted into the army, and spent three years (1942‚Äì1945) in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He served as a technical sergeant in laboratory and pharmacy at an army evacuation hospital, and cared for internees released in the Philippines near the war's end. During his war years, Rogerson made collections of plants, fungi, slime molds, and butterflies that he sent to Cornell or to the Smithsonian Institution. After the war finished, Rogerson continued studying fungal systematics and started a doctoral program with Harry Morton Fitzpatrick at Cornell University; noted mycologist Richard Korf was another of Fitzpatrick's graduate students at the time. Under Fitzpatrick, Rogerson studied Hypomyces fungi and their anamorphs. Fitzpatrick committed suicide in 1950, and Donald S. Welch replaced him as Rogerson's advisor for the last few months of his doctoral program. Rogerson received his doctorate from Cornell in 1950. That year, he joined the faculty of Kansas State University as an assistant professor, but he would ultimately advance to associate professor. While at Kansas, he worked on the identification of fungi, and published nearly 20 papers on fungal taxonomic novelties, aeromycology (the fungal flora of air), and plant diseases caused by fungi. In 1958, the director of The New York Botanical Garden, William Jacob Robbins, recruited Rogerson for the position of Curator of Cryptogamic Botany. Rogerson became Senior Curator in 1967 and Senior Curator Emeritus at his retirement in 1990. As curator of cryptogamic botany, Rogerson \\"was directly responsible for all accessions and loans of ferns and mosses, as well as of fungi and lichens, until about 1965 when, first a bryologist and later a pteridologist were added to the cryptogamic staff.\\" At the Garden, he also continued his study on the taxonomy of the Ascomycetes, especially of Hypomyces, a genus of fungi that parasitize other fungi, and the fungal diversity of New York and Utah. Additionally, he served as editor of the Garden's publications: Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden (1963‚Äì88), North American Flora (1963‚Äì88), and Flora Neotropica (1969‚Äì83). While at the Garden, Rogerson was also an adjunct professor of biology at Columbia University and at the Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York. Hypomyces cervinigenus (shown infecting the Helvella fruit body on the right) is one of several species formally described by Rogerson. During his tenure at the Garden, Rogerson was also a deeply involved member of the Mycological Society of America (MSA). He served as Managing editor (1958‚Äì89) and Editor-in-chief (1960‚Äì65) of the scientific journal Mycologia. He was Vice-President (1967), President Elect (1968), and President of the MSA (1969), and secretary-treasurer of the society from 1973 to 1974. He has served as historian of the Mycological Society of America from 1960 to 1990. Rogerson was a generous donor to MSA student travel awards. He died in Ogden on September 7, 2001.  Mycological contributions Rogerson added many thousands of records of fungi, mainly from Utah, to the Garden herbarium, where his specimens are available for study by systematists. Rogerson assisted in the formation of the three major amateur mushroom groups in the New York City area: the New York Mycological Association, the New Jersey Mycological Association, and the Connecticut-Westchester Mycological Association (COMA). He helped amateur mycologists correctly identify fungal specimens during his weekends. \\"In return, amateur mycologists provided him with many specimens of fungicolous Hypomyces.\\" In 1970, Rogerson presented a detailed history of the Hypocreales and reviewed changes in the circumscription of the order up to that time. His publication included keys to the genera of both the Hypocreales and Clavicipitales, followed by a list of genera, each with the literature citation of the original descriptions and type species. He included 115 genera in the Hypocreales.

Carey 1981  Mycological lineage  Clark T. Rogerson belongs to the Dudley mycological lineage, which can be traced back to Anton De Bary, a famous German mycologist. William Russell Dudley was Assistant Professor of Cryptogamic Botany at Cornell University from 1883 to 1892, and received mycological training from De Bary in 1887. Joseph Charles Arthur, George Francis Atkinson, and Mason B. Thomas studied under Dudley. Thomas went to Wabash College, where he would influence Harry Morton Fitzpatrick to study mycology. Fitzpatrick received his Ph.D. in 1913 at Cornell under tutelage of Atkinson. Rogerson studied under Fitzpatrick at Cornell from 1946 to 1950. Contemporary to Rogerson was fellow student Richard P. Korf, another prominent mycologist. Students of Rogerson include Robert L. Shaffer (Kansas State; M.A.), Susan Carey Canham (Columbia University; Ph.D.), Anna F. Doyle (Columbia University; Ph.D.), Gary J. Samuels (Columbia University; Ph.D.), and Rosalind Lowen (Lehman College; Ph.D.). Katia F. Rodrigues and Priscila Chaverri (Penn State; Ph.D.) studied under Samuels. The Rogerson sublineage continues to expand under Chaverri at the University of Maryland.  Honors and memberships  Rogerson received several awards and honors during his career: *1969: President of the Mycological Society of America *1980: North American Mycological Association (NAMA) award for contributions to amateur mycology *1981: Award from the Mycological Society of America in appreciation for service to the Society as Historian, Secretary- Treasurer, Vice-President, and President and as Managing Editor and Editor-in- Chief of Mycologia *1981: The Connecticut-Westchester Mycological Association (COMA) named their annual four-day mushroom foray after C.T. Rogerson in appreciation of his commitment to education and the development of amateur mycology. *1984: New York Botanical Garden Distinguished Service Award for outstanding contribution to the advancement of Horticulture and Botany *1985: COMAndation for outstanding service to COMA *1989: A commemorative publication celebrating the 70th birthday of C.T. Rogerson (Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden 49: 1‚Äì375). *2004: The Mycological Society of America established the Clark T. Rogerson student research and travel award. Rogerson was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Bergen Swamp Preservation Society, and the Utah Academy of Sciences.

The henge enclosing Knowlton Church is the best known and best preserved, but there are at least two other henges in the vicinity as well as numerous round barrows. Overview The Knowlton Circles are a cluster of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments near Knowlton. There are four enclosures, three are of normal henge form, Church Henge, Knowlton North and Knowlton South, and the fourth is a squarish enclosure known as Old Churchyard. Church Henge is the best preserved of these monuments and encloses the ruins of Knowlton Church. Nearby is the large round barrow known as Great Barrow and a number of other round barrows are also focused on the area. Church Henge Church Henge (also known as the Central Circle, ) is the best preserved of the three henges at Knowlton. It is an oval enclosure surrounded by a ditch and earthwork bank. The enclosure is orientated roughly northeast to southwest and measures 106 metres by 94 metres. The enclosing ditch is 10 metres wide and up to 1 metre deep. The outer banks are 10 metres in width and stand up to 1.75 metres high. They consist of a series of straight lengths linked by rounded corners. Three gaps are present in the bank, to the southwest, east and northeast. It unclear which of the gaps are original, although the east entrance is likely to be original, whereas the west entrance was altered at a later date, possibly after the construction of the church. Map of the Knowlton Circles henge complex Knowlton church stands in the middle of the henge, and symbolises the transition from pagan to Christian worship. Early Christian activity at Knowlton is indicated by a mid-to-late Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemetery which was discovered to the east of Church Henge in 1958. Excavations located sixteen burials within chalk-cut graves, some aligned east-west. The earliest parts of the church are the 12th century chancel and nave and there are 15th and 18th century additions and alterations. In the 18th century the roof fell in and the church was abandoned. North Circle Knowlton North () is a small henge to the northwest of Church Henge, and is the northernmost henge in the Knowlton group. It has largely been destroyed by ploughing. The site is clearly visible as cropmarks, although its original form is uncertain. It appears to be an elongated oval enclosure comprising a ditch with external bank, orientated roughly northwest to south east with a maximum diameter of 94 metres. There is a large entrance on the southeast side. South Circle Knowlton South () is the southernmost of the henges and is also the largest. It still partially survives as an earthwork though it has suffered from ploughing and parts are better visible as cropmarks. The henge is now bisected by the Cranborne to Wimborne road, and farm buildings occupy part of the western side. The maximum diameter of the henge is around 250 metres. The enclosure is defined by a ditch and outer bank separated by a berm. It appears to have been constructed as a series of straight lengths linked by shorter curving lengths. It is best preserved on the north-west side where the bank is 13 metres wide and about 1.2 metres high, separated by a berm 3.5 metres across from the ditch. The ditch is 15 metres wide and 1.5 metres deep. It is not known where the original entrance was, and it may lie to the west under the road or the farm buildings. Old Churchyard Old Churchyard () is an enclosure of uncertain origin and function situated southwest of the North Circle. It has been almost completely levelled by ploughing but it still visible as a cropmark. It is a rounded square in plan, about 60 metres in diameter, and is bounded by a low bank and an external ditch. Great Barrow Great Barrow viewed from Church Henge Great Barrow () is a large round barrow of probable Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age date. It is east of Church Henge, and crowned with a clump of trees.History and Research: Knowlton Church and Earthworks, English Heritage, retrieved 12 November 2013 It is the largest barrow in Dorset. The barrow is a mound 40 metres in diameter and 6 metres high, surrounded by two concentric ditches, both largely levelled by ploughing. The inner ditch is separated from the mound by a 5 metre berm. The outer ditch is 10 metres wide, 1.5 metres deep and is 120 metres in diameter. Knowlton Circles Barrow Group There are at least 35 barrows known in the Knowlton Circles Barrow Group including The Great Barrow. It is one of the greatest concentrations of round barrows in Dorset. Most are only known as cropmarks, although some are visible to the southwest of the South Circle. The barrows can be placed into three groups: located south and south west of the South Circle, north of the South Circle and around the Church Henge, and north east of the henges. This cluster of barrows indicates that the Knowlton Circles were an important religious centre.

History The church was built in the 15th century, and restored in 1860 and 1878. It is a small structure with a tower steeple with three old bells, (to which were added three newly cast bells in the late 1950s) and a clock, a nave, chancel and a porch. Most of the building dates from the 15th century, with several 18th century memorials and 19th century stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe. The chancel and sanctuary contain furniture by Robert (Mousey) Thompson, featuring his trademark mouse carvings. In early spring the church is surrounded by a spectacular display of snowdrops, which the public is free to visit. According to Piercy,The History of Retford in The County of Nottingham. John Shadrach Piercy, 1828 in 1295 the advowson of Babworth church was the property of Robert de Swillington, \\"who had free warren in Babworth\\". In 1365 after Swillington's death, it became the property of Sir Thomas de Grendon, who sold it to Sir William Trussbutt. Trussbutt is said to have presented it to the priory of Newstead, having first obtained the king‚Äôs licence, and the licence of Sir Thomas de Saundby to do so. Newstead priory remained in possession of the church until 1531, until the prior of Newstead, John Blake, granted it and one acre of land to John Hercy, Esq. of Grove for the sum of fifteen pounds. In 1674 it became the property of the Wortleys, from whom it was purchased by John Simpson, Esq. Piercy describes the church favourably as \\"a small but handsome structure of stone, advantageously situated on a rising ground. It consists of tower steeple, with three bells, and clock, a nave and chancel uniform in their windows, height, and battlements, with a side aisle and vestry, and a handsome porch. The whole is of the later period of the Gothic architecture. The little burial plot which surrounds it, is considerably elevated, being connected with, or rather enclosed within the elegant pleasure grounds of the adjacent buildings; while the fine trees, aged and bowery, enhance materially the charming effect of the ivy-mantled tower.\\" The congregation became Separatist on 11 July 1586 when Rev Richard Clyfton became Minister. He was deprived of his living in 1604. William Brewster and William Bradford, worshipped here until the Separatist Church was formed at Scrooby in 1606 when they and Clyfton moved there. Brewster and Bradford were both passengers aboard the Mayflower. Clyfton escaped to Amsterdam in 1608 and died there on 20 May 1616. A street in New Plymouth Massachusetts is named after him.

Some of the responsibilities trainers have are caring for the animals‚Äô physical needs, as well as teaching them submissive behaviors and/or coaching them for events, which may include contests and other riding purposes.https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/blsoccupation/animal_care_and_service_workers/0 The level of education and the yearly salary they can earn for this profession may differ depending on where the person is employed. History Horse domestication by the Botai culture in Kazakhstan dates to about 3500 BC. Written records of horse training as a pursuit has been documented as early as 1350 BC, by Kikkuli, the Hurrian \\"master horse trainer\\" of the Hittite Empire. Another source of early recorded history of horse training as a discipline comes from the Greek writer Xenophon, in his treatise On Horsemanship. Writing circa 350 BC, Xenophon addressed starting young horses, selecting older animals, and proper grooming and bridling. He discussed different approaches to spirited and dull horses and how to deal with vices. His approach is credited as the first known method of training horses through a sympathetic approach, wherein the trainer attempts to understand the natural instincts of the horse and build a relationship. thumb  Responsibilities  In horse racing, a trainer prepares a horse for races, with responsibility for exercising it, getting it race-ready and determining which races it should enter. Leading horse trainers can earn a great deal of money from a percentage of the winnings that they charge the owner for training the horse. Outside horse racing, most trainers specialize in a certain equestrianism discipline, such as show jumping, reining, rodeo, sport horse disciplines, training of a specific horse breed, starting young horses, or working with problem horses. There are a wide variety of horse training methods used to teach the horse to do the things humans want them to do. Some fields can be very lucrative, usually depending on the value of the horses once trained or prize money available in competition. However, as a rule, most horse trainers earn, at best, a modest income which often requires supplementation from a second job or additional horse-related business, such as horse boarding or riding lessons. Horse trainers are typically deemed to have the status of agents for the horse owners. As such, they have legal obligations to their owners, as well as authority to represent and even bind their owners to certain transactions.  Education and training  Graduation from some form of secondary school, which is usually mandatory to become an animal trainer, is one of the qualifications a horse trainer may need. While this is a requirement for some employers, others may only require that horse trainers learn as they go along. Beginners in horse training can learn more about the subject at a college institution, which can be beneficial for their profession, but it is not always mandatory for horse trainers. Apprenticeship is also another option if a person wants to gain more knowledge about the profession. When starting out in the profession, a horse trainer may not be given the assignments of a more learned and seasoned trainer until they gain more maturity in the job. Or, prior to their employment, they can learn and develop their skills elsewhere. A horse trainer may also need to acquire a license in order to train.  Salary  The earnings of horse trainers may be different depending on the country and the place of employment. According to the United States Department of Labor, ‚ÄúThe median annual wage for animal trainers was $25,270 in May 2012. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $17,580, and the top 10 percent earned more than $49,840.‚Äù The Government of Western Australia Department of Training and Workforce Development, in their section about horse trainers, state that $43,399 may be the standard yearly wages in Western Australia. Racehorse trainers in the UK can earn up to a standard yearly amount of ¬£45,000, depending on the level of expertise a person possesses. For independent horse trainers, their status and the amount of work they do can influence the salary. \\"Race winnings\\" can also provide a trainer with additional money.  Controversies  Drug usage in horses has been a disputed topic in the field of equine. The acceptable purpose of drugs in this area is to reduce suffering of injuries in racehorses, but sometimes drugs are used unlawfully to get an advantage over other horses, which can result in penalties for the horse trainer in question. With the numerous weekly deaths of racehorses, drugs are a disputed cause of death in horses. The intoxication of horses is concerning to some people, such as veterinarians and legislators. Some trainers defend drugs, implying that they are not the causes of the deaths. Some trainers also deny that they use drugs for unlawful purposes, sometimes because of their respect for horses.

He travelled extensively around Britain to see and collect plants and lichens, and also once crossed the English Channel to visit Normandy. He was accompanied on some of his travels by William Jackson Hooker and by Charles Cardale Babington. Borrer was particularly interested in lichens, willows, roses and succulents although had a very broad knowledge of plants. He was particularly good at recording plant identifications but often omitted the date and location where the plant was collected. He was also frequently consulted about identifications. He attempted to grow many plant species in his garden so that he could distinguish key identification characteristics without concerns that differences were caused by different habitats. In W. A. Clarke's First Records of British Flowering Plants published in 1897, Borrer was credited as the first to identify 21 species of flowering plants at locations from Cornwall to Caithness. These included Isnardia palustris at Buxted in 1827 and the grass Leersia oryzoides at Henfield Levels in 1844 and several willows. He also identified several marine algae and lichens. He met and corresponded with other botanists in the UK and abroad including Joseph Banks, Dawson Turner, Hewett Cottrell Watson and Joseph Hooker and exchanged plant specimens with them. Borrer was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1805 as well Fellow of the Royal Society in 1835. He was also a member of the Wernerian Natural History Society based in Edinburgh. Borrer was one of those who proposed William Hooker for fellowship of the Linnean Society in 1806. Publications Borrer published very little in his own name but contributed information to several important works on British botany during the early 1800s that acknowledged his assistance. This included the Sussex flora in Turner and Dillwyn's Botanist's Guide through England and Wales published in 1805. In 1813 he began to work with Dawson Turner on British lichens and the Lichenographia Britannica was finally published in 1839. He contributed to numerous other publications such as descriptions of lichens, Salix, Rosa, and Rubus to the supplement to English Botany published in 1830. His extensive annotated herbarium is conserved at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and his correspondance is held in several archives, including Cambridge University Library. Over living 6600 specimens were recorded in his garden including exotic plants and trees. Some were transferred to Kew Gardens after his death. The collection included 81 different willow species. Several plant species were named after him, including Borrer's salt marsh grass, Glyceria borreri (Bab.) Bab. (later given the new systematic name Puccinellia fasciculata (Torr.) Bicknell), the fern Dryopteris borreri Newm., the seaweed Callithamnion borreri (currently considered a synonym of Pleonosporium borreri (Smith) N√§geli), the desmid Didymoprium borreri (Ralfs) Ralfs, the scentless briar Rosa borreri Woods, and the hybrid woodrush Luzula x borreri Bromf. ex Bab (currently considered to be Luzula forsteri x pilosa). He named the wild leek, Allium babingtonii Borrer after his friend Babington. Personal life Borrer was born in Henfield, Sussex, on 13 June 1781. His parents were landowners and farmers who supplied the army. He was educated at private schools and by tutors. He was interested in plants from a young age. After he inherited family wealth, he could devote himself to plants. Borrer was a patron of the sciences and supported his local church financially. He was also promoted education of the poor through building schools on his land. He was also a magistrate. He married Elizabeth Hall in 1810 and they had 13 children together. Five died in childhood. He died at his residence at Barrow-hill, Sussex on 10 January 1862.

Archaeologists believe that it was likely erected during the Bronze Age. The Rempstone ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those who built the circles. Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after being thrown at Corfe Castle by the Devil. A number of these circles were built in the area around modern Dorset, typically being smaller than those found elsewhere. Most of these Dorset circles are made of sarsen stone, although the Rempstone circle is unique in being made from local sandstone. The southern half of the circle has been destroyed, with five upright and three recumbent stones remaining extant. Having been damaged by eighteenth century clay workings, the monument is at present situated within dense woodland. In 1957, a possible avenue of stones leading to the circle was discovered by ploughing but subsequently removed. Location Rempstone Stone Circle is positioned at the national grid reference 39940821. The incomplete stone circle lies in a dense wood just to the south of the B3351 road, east of Corfe Castle and west of Studland. It is located at the foot of Nine Barrows Down, at a height of above sea level. It is south of Rempstone Lodge. As with the Nine Stones at Winterbourne Abbas, the Rempstone Stone Circle is located in a valley. The land on which the site sits is privately owned, and is accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Context While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic‚Äîwhich took place with the transition from the fourth to the third millennium BCE‚Äîwitnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These latter circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner. They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, with the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE. These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, and may have been deliberately left as \\"silent and empty monuments\\". The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities. The area of modern Dorset has only a \\"thin scatter\\" of stone circles, with nine possible examples known within its boundaries. The archaeologist John Gale described these as \\"a small but significant group\\" of such monuments, and all are located within five miles of the sea. Of the Dorset circles, Rempstone is the only example that is not located on the chalk hills west of Dorchester. The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, with none exceeding 28 metres (92 feet) in diameter. All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form. The Rempstone circle is exceptional among these, as it is the only one which does not consist of sarsen stone. However, like all the others‚Äîwith the exception of the circle at Litton Cheney‚Äîit does not display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks. The archaeologists Stuart and Cecily Piggott believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin, a view endorsed by the archaeologist Aubrey Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites. It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date, and the Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \\"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\\". Their nearest analogies are the circles found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period. Description Plan of Rempstone Stone Circle (based on that published by Piggott and Piggott in 1939) Burl has noted that Rempstone Stone Circle is \\"damaged and overgrown\\". Similarly, Gale stated that \\"the description and evaluation of this site [is] very difficult\\" on account of it being \\"much disturbed\\". Eight stones survive; five are standing, while three more are recumbent. The standing stones vary in size, and are irregularly shaped. The stones are sandstone boulders which geologically belong to the Bagshot Beds, on which the circle is located. The southern half of the circle has been destroyed, likely by clay workings that took place in the area during the late eighteenth century. At the south-west of the site, three more stones are visible but half-buried; these may not be in their original position. The west side of the site is cut by pools and ditches formed by old clay workings. The surviving stones form an arc that suggests that the circle originally had a diameter of about 26 metres, or 80 feet. If this was the case then it would have been the second largest stone circle in Dorset, after Kingston Russell Stone Circle. The circle was included in the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford's Map of Neolithic Wessex, printed by the Ordnance Survey in 1932. In this publication, the site was erroneously assigned co-ordinates of the Breamore Wood Long Barrow. As of 2003, the site had not been excavated. Related monuments In August 1957, the local farmer W. G. Best was ploughing on his Brenscombe Farm when he uncovered a row of 23 stones that was situated about west of Rempstone Stone Circle. His son stood most of these into an upright position, to better assist their later removal. The antiquarian J. Bernard Calkin was alerted to the discovery and visited it prior to the stones being removed by the farmer. Calkin noted that the stones were made of local sandstone and were smaller than the stones in the circle, averaging about 2 feet 6 inches by 1 foot 6 inches. He believed that they had been deliberately lain out in two parallel lines, 3 yards apart and with an interval of five yards between each stone. Calkin suggested that this may have been a stone avenue or processional way leading to the circle. Burl later expressed scepticism with regard to this interpretation, stating that its \\"credentials are suspect\\". east of the circle is a group of eight stones which may have had some relationship to the circle. There is also a cluster of barrows, known as \\"Nine Barrows\\", on the hill immediately to the south of the stone circle. Folklore After the monument was discovered and identified in the twentieth century, a folk motif came to be associated with it. According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of a story that has also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories associated with this large sandstone block, it had been thrown by the Devil from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.

Nicolas led a 30-man boarding party to seize Louisa, while Mercury escaped. Clarisse could not give chase, her bowsprit having been destroyed in a collision with Louisa. Nicolas Surcouf took a prize crew and sailed Louisa back to Port Louis.Austen (1935), pp.93-94. In May 1800, Nicolas Surcouf captained the privateer Ad√®le.

In 1804, Robert Surcouf returned to Saint-Malo and started equipping privateers. He gave Nicolas command of the 14-gun Caroline, on which Nicolas cruised the Indian Ocean. Nicholas captured the ships Waldegrave and Commerce in the Indian Ocean, and Melville and Prince de Galles in the Gulf of Bengal On 30 August 1815, Nicolas Surcouf joined the brig Amiti√©, under Captain Beaudouin.

He was one of the lieutenants of Robert Surcouf. Early life Joseph Potier was born to a family of low nobility of Saint-Malo. His mother was a descendant of Robert Surcouf de Maisonneuve, and he was therefore a distant cousin to Robert Surcouf. Merchant navy captain Potier started sailing as a boy on the ships that his father equipped and sent out to Guinea and the Caribbean. He rose to become an officer in the merchant marine and eventually to Captain on 28 April 1792.Cunat, p.411 With this rank, he served as first officer on the Aimable-Rose, under Captain de La Coudraie. French Navy in the Revolution Returning to France during the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror, he enlisted in the French Navy as an Ensign; he was appointed to a frigate bound for the Caribbean, which remained there for a few months before decommissioning in the USA. For fear of being considered an √©migr√©, he returned to France, where he served in the general staff of Brest harbour until late 1795. After the Battle of Quiberon, he commanded a company of sailors that hunted down the surviving √©migr√©s. Privateer Having obtained a release from Navy duty in late 1795, Potier enlisted on the privateer Heureuse-Nouvelle as first officer. Heureuse- Nouvelle was armed with 22 guns and had a crew of 130 men; she captured a number of prizes until 28 January 1798, when a British squadron under Captain Edward Pellew comprising HMS Indefatigable, Cambrian, and the hired armed lugger Duke of York captured her. The British took Potier prisoner.Cunat, p.411 Exchanged, Potier returned to Brest, where he re-entered the Navy. On 23 September 1800, he was released from duty.Cunat, p.412 The following year, he enlisted as first officer on the three-masted merchantman Courrier de l'Ile de France, under Captain Duval; when she arrived at Port Louis, Duval gave command of the ship to Potier for a cruise to Batavia, and return to Mauritius. Returning to France on 29 March 1803, Potier witnessed the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens and the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition in May. On 2 January 1804, Robert Surcouf gave him command of the 14-gun privateer Confiance. Potier led several campaigns on Confiance, during which he captured two British merchantmen, one loaded with soap and the other with spirits.Gallois, vol.2, p.302-303 In February 1807,Gallois, vol.2, p.303 Surcouf enlisted Potier as first officer on his new privateer Revenant. After Revenant returned to Port-Louis from her first campaign, on 31 January 1808,Cunat, p.399 Surcouf gave Potier command of the ship on 2 April.Cunat, p.413 In late April, as Revenant was completing her preparations and plotting her route, a prize taken by the privateer Ad√®le gave news of the new war between France and Portugal; she also brought intelligence about the Conce√ß√°o- de-Santo-Antonio, a 64-gun ship of the line armed en fl√ªte in Goa, bound for Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon. Surcouf gave Portier the mission to intercept, and Revenant departed Port-Louis on 30 April. She arrived in her patrol zone on 17 May and detected her target on the 24th. Revenant captured Conce√ß√°o-de-Santo- Antonio after a one-hour battle.Cunat, p.417Report of Captain Joseph Potier, quoted in Lepelley, p. 143 ‚Äî 144 Potier put a prize crew under First Lieutenant Fonroc on Conce√ß√°o, and returned to Mauritius one month later with his prize.Cunat, p.418 Potier left Revenant, which was sent back to Saint-Malo en aventurier with colonial goods. next, he took command of the 18-gun 600-ton Diamant, a British prize taken by the privateer Napol√©on after a three-day chase. In mid-October, Diamant left Mauritius, also armed en aventurier with goods and passengers, and bound for Lorient. She arrived in Quiberon Bay in the evening of 21 January 1809 and ran into the British blockade; a frigate gave chase, but Potier managed to escape by throwing his artillery overboard. Diamant arrived off Bordeaux on the 23rd, where a storm forced Potier to have his masts cut down to save his ship; he finally arrived in Bordeau harbour on the 25th. On his return to Saint-Malo, Portier co-founded the ship-owning company Joseph Potier et Harembert. The company was then responsible for arming a number of privateers.Cunat, p.419 Carrying slaves in the Bourbon Restoration During the Bourbon Restoration, Portier armed the slave ship Africain, on which he ferried slaves from Guinea to Martinique. Africain ended her career in Saint-Malo on 25 July 1816, after which Potier sailed only once more, on Narcisse, in 1819.Cunat, p.420  Notes  References  Bibliography   Category:People of the Quasi-War Category:French privateers Category:French Navy officers Category:1768 births Category:1830 deaths Category:French slave traders ","title":"Joseph Potier"},{"id":"39083893","text":"Trechus apoduvalipenis is a species of ground beetle in the subfamily Trechinae.

After the promotion dissolved, he transferred to All Japan Pro Wrestling and trained under Genichiro Tenryu. He made his debut on April 8, 1988, against Mitsuo Momota. He was part of Tenryu's Revolution stable. After spending nearly a year floundering in the opening and mid-card matches, Kitahara left for Canada in March 1989. When he arrived in Canada, he joined Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling in Calgary, where he used the ring name Sumo Hara. On July 4, Kitahara was involved in a car accident near Jasper, Alberta, which he escaped uninjured. In August 1989, Kitahara won his first championship, the Stampede International Tag Team Championship with fellow Japanese wrestler Kensuke Sasaki. The two held the championship for more than a month before losing them to The Blackhearts. After Stampede shut down in December 1989, he returned to Japan in February 1990. Upon returning to AJPW, Kitahara was finally finding his niche, but was cut short the summer of 1990, when Kitahara joined his mentor Tenryu and Megane Super. After leaving AJPW, Kitahara would make a brief return to Canada to wrestle for the Canadian National Wrestling Alliance as Sumo Hara, before returning to Japan for the new promotion. Super World Sports (1990‚Äì1992) Kitahara wrestled for Super World of Sports in 1990. As expected, he was part of Tenryu's group, Revolution. In December 1990, Kitahara took part in the original four-man tournament for the SWS Light Heavyweight Championship, but lost to Naoki Sano in the semi-finals when a doctor called a stop to the match. After a year in mid-card tag team matches, Kitahara teamed with Shinichi Nakano for a tournament to determine the SWS Tag Team Champions, but lost to his Revolution stablemates, Tenryu and Ashura Hara. In June 1992, SWS folded. WAR (1992‚Äì2000) Upon SWS's folding, Kitahara joined Tenryu in forming WAR. Now known as Koki Kitahara, in the early years of WAR, Kitahara would be Tenryu's main tag team partner in battles against New Japan Pro Wrestling, but in later years, he teamed with Koji Kitao. In September 1994, Kitahara toured Mexico for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. In April 1995, Kitahara won his first championship in Japan, the WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, with Tenryu and Animal Hamaguchi. He won two more, with Arashi, Nobutaka Araya, and Lance Storm as his partners. In 1999, WAR folded. Freelance (1999‚Äì2018) In 1997, still as a WAR member, Kitahara formed his own mixed martial arts dojo, Capture International. It initially developed into a shoot-style professional wrestling promotion, which held its first card in 1998. He later expanded it into a non-profit private security company named Japan Blue Blazer. After WAR folded, Kitahara focused primarily on Capture International, while taking select shows and tours of various promotions, including a brief return to AJPW in 2001, where he won the All Asia Tag Team Championship with Arashi, and also with Tenryu Project. On April 2, 2018, Kitahara announced his retirement to take place at a June 11 card promoted by AJPW dojo classmate Kenta Kobashi, which will also be his 30th anniversary. In a tag team match, Kitahara and Mitsuya Nagai lost to Naomichi Marufuji and Super Tiger II.

He played college football at Ohio State. Linsley was drafted by the Packers in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft. High school career A native of Boardman, Ohio, Linsley attended Boardman High School, where he earned first-team All-Federal League, All-Northeast Ohio and second-team All-Ohio honors. He served as a team captain as a senior. He was named to SuperPrep's Midwest Top 30. As a standout athlete, he lettered all four years in track & field, where he was the regional and league champion and a state medalist in the shot put (top throw of 19.24 meters as a senior). He also threw the discus, with a top throw of 58.27 meters as a senior. At Ohio State, he considered switching to track and field and quit football entirely. Regarded as a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Linsley was listed as the No. 6 offensive guard prospect of his class. College career After redshirting his initial year at Ohio State, Linsley saw limited action in six games in 2010, mostly as a reserve right guard or tackle. As a sophomore, he appeared in ten games, still as a reserve. He did see significant action on the PAT and field goal teams as a blocker, though. After playing two seasons at guard, he was designated to succeed All- American center Mike Brewster at center. He started all 12 games at center and help the Buckeyes to post a Big Ten-best 37.2 points per game while ranking second in rushing with an average of 242.2 yards per game on the ground. Linsley was viewed as an integral part of the Buckeyes' offense. Professional career Washington Redskins Linsley was selected in the fifth round (161st overall) by the Green Bay Packers in the 2014 NFL Draft. On May 15, 2014, he signed a contract with the Packers. In 2014, Linsley was initially supposed to be the Packers' back-up center, but an injury to expected starter JC Tretter late in the preseason made Linsley the surprise starting center for the regular season. After Tretter came back from his injury, Linsley remained as starting center and ended up starting every game during the regular season as well as the 2 playoff games. On September 3, 2016, Linsley was placed on Reserve/PUP to start the season after a lingering hamstring injury. He was activated off PUP on November 5, 2016. On December 30, 2017, Linsley signed a three-year, $25.5 million contract extension with the Packers after starting all 16 games at center in 2017.

Referring to herself as a painting anthropologist, her primary subject is the human form. Her distinctive style mixes abstract and indigenous motifs and is often compared to the mid-century masters. She credits her Colombian roots for her aesthetic and tastes.  Family and early life  America was born in Los Angeles in 1980 to a family of artists. Her uncle is painter Knox Martin, her father is artist, matador, and published author Ernest J. T. Martin, her mother is an academic, and her siblings all went on to pursue careers in the arts. At the age of nine, she came across a book on Vincent van Gogh and began to draw. Shortly thereafter, she began an eight-year apprenticeship with Vernon Wilson who was a professor at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. She also worked briefly as an actress, notably as Patsy in Disney's The Rocketeer, while attending Crossroads School for the Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica, California.  Fine art  During her fifteen-year practice, she has worked in a variety of media including painting, drawing and sculpting in steel and aluminum. Perhaps her most iconic work is her large format paintings of nudes. Of these works, art critic Stacy Davies wrote, ‚ÄúMartin‚Äôs women are hyper-real‚Ä¶ They are solid, immovable, inerasable; they are present. They cannot be dominated, but not because they are angry or violent or ugly, but because they are stoic and centered and complete.‚Äù In addition to her female nudes, Martin's subjects include jazz musicians, boxers, Native Americans, street scenes, landscapes and still lives. Martin's process is intrinsic to the work itself. She uses her whole body when painting, using the length of her arms to control the strokes. Her move to a new studio in Silverlake in 2009 allowed her to refine her process and experiment with a variety of new media. It has and continues to act as a venue to host a variety of cultural events that support artist and community. She traditionally works in collections- painting and drawing a unique body of work distinct to the location of the exhibition.  Career  Martin has been shown and collected internationally. In 2002, she had her first solo show in Beverly Hills and has since been exhibiting in solo and group shows. In 2009, she received a residency with the Walter Anderson Museum of Art with a grant from the Mississippi Arts Commission. She has been represented in Austin, Laguna Beach, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York City, Ontario, Santa Barbara, Taos and Maine. She is currently working on a multimedia show about her native Los Angeles for 2014.  Publications  In 2010, Martin's first book was published titled Insouciance, which featured the artist's early career paintings and drawings. Scheduled for release at the end of 2013, her second book entitled Yes will feature work from 2009 to 2012. Both are published by Snail Press Publications.  Personal life  America Martin married Cinematographer Ross Richardson in 2008. They divorced in 2016.

It was first published in a December issue of Argosy All-Story Weekly magazine. It became the title story of a 1948 collection of four Hammett short stories published in paperback with illustrations. It appeared again in 1999, the eponymous story of a collection of twenty short stories edited by Kirby McCauley, Martin H Greenberg and Ed Gorman. It was adapted for BBC radio in June 2010 and read by Stuart Milligan.  Significance  \\"Nightmare Town\\" begins as an adventure story, and Threefall is typical of the rough, manly hero often to be found in the genre. However, the setting is no adventure story environment, but according to Panek, a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, \\"Izzard is the city in the desert whose iniquity leads to its own destruction.\\" (Panek, 2004) It is the Prohibition Era, and violence and criminality are the foundations on which the town was built. Hammett had hit upon a theme which he would develop in subsequent work, such as Corkscrew (1925) and his acclaimed novel, Red Harvest (1926).  Style  Hammett's work moved away from the drawing-room detective of the \\"Golden Age\\" of English detective fiction exemplified in the work of Arthur Conan Doyle, Dorothy L. Sayers and Agatha Christie. In his 1944 critical essay The Simple Art of Murder, Raymond Chandler wrote of Hammett's themes and style: :\\"Hammett took murder out of the Venetian vase and dropped it into the alley; it doesn‚Äôt have to stay there forever, but it was a good idea to begin by getting as far as possible from Emily Post‚Äôs idea of how a well-bred debutante gnaws a chicken wing. He wrote at first (and almost to the end) for people with a sharp, aggressive attitude to life. They were not afraid of the seamy side of things; they lived there. Violence did not dismay them; it was right down their street.\\"  Plot  Steve Threefall accepts a bet with a hotelier in Whitetufts that he can drive a friend's Ford non-stop across the desert with no supplies but liquor. After two days driving, he careens through the main street of a desert boom town named Izzard, Arizona. He narrowly misses knocking down a young woman. He mumbles a drunken apology but she ignores him. His car ends up smashed into the red brick wall of the Bank of Izzard. The marshal, Grant Fernie, jails him overnight for drunk and dangerous driving. The next morning he pays a fine and as he leaves the courthouse he witnesses an altercation between two of the town's denizens, a large, beefy man named W.W. Ormsby and a thin man in his thirties, who is his son, Larry. Larry even pulls a gun on his father by way of warning. Steve goes to send a telegram to Whitetufts to collect on his bet. He meets the young woman he almost knocked down. She works there and her name is Nova Vallance. She is engrossed in conversation with Larry, but they hush up as soon as they see Steve watching them. Steve tries to apologize to Nova but she turns her back on him. He sends his telegram and wanders outside. He meets a melancholy man named Roy Kamp. Roy tells him about the town. The main industry is a ‚Äòsoda niter‚Äô (sodium nitrate) chemical plant. Dave Brackett is the banker, W.W. Ormsby owns the plant and Larry Ormsby imports flashy cars and is in love with Nova. Conan Elder deals in real estate, insurance and securities. Steve assumes that Larry was roughing up his father because of business interests. Roy takes Steve to Finn's Lunchroom. Old Man Rymer, a blind man in his seventies, is eating a meal at the counter. Roy confides to Steve the legend that Rymer, who lives alone, has a stash of gold coins hidden under the floorboards of his shack. Roy says that this desert boom-town draws merciless men. Late that night, having played poker, Roy and Steve walk by the Izzard Hotel. Several men rush out of the hotel, attacking Steve and Roy. Steve fights back, using the ebony stick he carries as weapon. Steve takes a beating but manages to fight and the men run away. Roy is fatally wounded. Just as Roy is about to tell Steve something, the marshal interrupts and Steve doesn't hear what Roy was about to say. Roy dies. The marshal sends Steve to find Dr. MacPhail to tend his wounds. Steve finds the doctor's house. He finds Nova there, she rents a room in the doctor's house. She is terrified. She suspects a burglar is in Dr. McPhail's room. She gives Steve a revolver. They go into the doctor's house together and surprise the burglar. Steve hits him with his stick but the burglar escapes. Steve is about to pursue him but Nova hangs onto him, preventing him from giving chase. Steve tries to shoot the burglar but the gun has no bullets. The house has been ransacked. Steve finds a watch and chain on the floor. Nova recognizes it as Old Man Rymer's. They go to Rymer's shack and find the place ransacked and Rymer knocked to the floor. They help him up. Rymer goes to some loose floorboards and finds it empty. Steve gives him the watch and chain. Steve and Nova walk back to the doctor's house. Nova realizes that Steve does not trust her. He says she gave him an empty gun and would not let him chase the burglar. She answers that she did not realize the gun was without bullets and that she did not want Steve to go after the burglar because she was afraid of being left alone. Nova says she has been in Izzard for three months. She says she is scared of Larry Ormsby. She says the town is a nightmare. Dr. and Mrs. MacPhail having returned to their house, Nova introduces Steve to them and the doctor tends his wounds. Steve returns to the hotel. Larry is sitting in his car outside the hotel. He warns Steve off Nova. Next morning, Steve is expected at the inquest into Roy Kamp's murder. They produce an Austrian man whose face is covered in bandages. The marshal insists that this is the man responsible for Kamp's death. He wants Steve to identify the Austrian as Roy's murderer. Steve recognizes it as a frame-up and refuses to implicate the innocent Austrian. Steve returns to his hotel. From his room window, he sees the face of the man he had fought with the night before, the real killer. He chases him to the Ormsby Niter Corporation Building. Steve loses the man but then observes Elder with a woman, Dr. MacPhail's wife. They are intimates. Steve hears a scream. He runs to the sound and finds Dave Brackett, the banker writhing in agony. Brackett says, ‚Äòthey‚Äôve poisoned me, the damned--‚Äô and then dies. Steve is fired upon. He bursts into the room where the gunfire is coming from to find Larry holding a gun and his father, W.W. Ormsby, shot dead at his feet. The marshal enters. Larry lies, saying he was with Steve and they found W.W. dead and a gun-man fleeing the scene. No- one questions Steve. He keeps quiet. That evening, Steve is out walking when he meets Nova at the doctor's house. She has heard the news from Dr. MacPhail that Brackett shot W.W. Orsmby and then had a heart attack. Steve tells her that Brackett was poisoned and W.W. was not shot by Brackett. They wonder why the doctor would lie about it. Nova says that MacPhail's medical report for Roy Kamp had named him as Henry Cumberpatch. Just then, Larry approaches. He tells Steve and Nova they must leave Izzard. Larry sways and coughs. He has been shot in the shoulder. Larry confesses that the soda niter plant is a front for a large illegal alcohol operation that is backed by the East Coast crime syndicate. The whole town is working together. He says that W.W. (who is not really his father) instigated the scheme and that Brackett was in on it, as are Elder, Dr. MacPhail and the marshal. At first they played fair with the East Coast syndicate, gave them their cut, but then they became greedy and began to lure people to the town for work, killed them to order, gave them fake names with fake insurance policies and now they plan to set fire to the town and collect on the fake insurance. They also sold stocks and bonds on fake companies in Izzard. Roy was an investigator who was on to the truth which is why he was murdered. However, when the telegraph company sent Nova to Izzard, Larry fell in love with her. She was moral but Larry promised W.W. and the rest that he would win her over to their plan. W.W. warned Larry that Nova would have to be murdered. He gave the order to kill her but Larry got wind of the plan and warned off W.W. (which is what Steve witnessed when he came out of jail). Larry confronted W.W. who poured some drinks for Larry and Brackett. Larry did not drink. Brackett died from the poisoned drink. Larry shot W.W. Then the marshal shot Larry in the shoulder, leading Larry to shoot the marshal. Larry warns that Elder and the others are planning to torch the town tonight. Steve hears Nova calling out. Dr. and Mrs. MacPhail are attempting to kill Nova. Steve fights and stops them. Steve and Nova leave. Larry promises to take care of Dr. and Mrs. MacPhail. Steve and Nova go over to Rymer's place. They try to make him ready to leave with them before the arson. He goes to change his clothes. Larry arrives in his car, ready for their getaway. The fire has started. However, Rymer comes out with two guns, his eyes now working; the film on his eyes was phony. There is a shoot-out and Rymer is shot. Larry dies from blood loss. Steve is attacked by a number of men, but he fights them off with his stick. Steve and Nova manage to get to the car. They drive into the desert. Steve and Nova plan to go to Delaware together, leaving Izzard - the nightmare town aflame.

The connection was strengthened when Oh-OK Lynda Stipe and Linda Hopper contributed backing vocals at a 40 Watt Club appearance that was taped to provide a rough-and ready three track demo. It includes the Self compositions 'Living By the Neck' and 'Peter Pan', and the Stipe-Self song 'meeting'. In addition to further occasional appearances in town and one short local tour Tanzplagen even got as far as recording tracks for a single, intended for release on David Healys ill-fated Dasht Hopes label. The studio chosen was Bombay in Smyrna where back in February R.E.M. had made its first recordings. Neil McArthur had left by the time of the session, and so William Lee Self, the groups real leader, doubled on bass while Lynda Stipe supplied vocals.

It was nominated for the Goodreads Choice Award for science fiction.https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-science-fiction-books-2013 Plot A century before the events of Ender's Game, an alien spaceship enters the solar system and soon makes known its hostile intentions by destroying harmless human ships. Then, it wipes out a ragtag fleet of asteroid miners who have banded together in a desperate attempt to stop it. All of the adult male members of Victor Delgado's extended clan die in the battle. The survivors are unable to transmit a warning, so Victor volunteers for a near- suicidal mission to try to reach Earth in a tiny, hastily converted unmanned cargo ship. He makes it to the Moon, but is unable to get the authorities to take him seriously. Thus, humanity is totally unprepared when the First Formic War starts. The invader sends three enormous landing craft to southeast China. The Formics emerge and use gas to defoliate the area and kill everyone. Despite suffering stupendous losses, the suspicious Chinese government refuses outside help. Before the landing, Mazer Rackham had been training the Chinese military on a new transport aircraft, the HERC, in exchange for training on their new invention, drill sledges that can tunnel quickly underground. During the Formic invasion, he saves Bingwen, a very intelligent eight-year-old Chinese boy, but is then shot down. Bingwen saves his life, with the remote help of Mazer's romantic interest, Kim. Bingwen and Mazer then set off to destroy the nearest Formic lander. The Mobile Operations Police (MOP), a small but elite international force, enters China (without official authorization). The MOPs save Bingwen and Mazer from a Formic attack. The lander is heavily shielded, but it does not extend underground. Mazer manages to find some drill sledges and HERCs to transport them close to the lander. MOP Captain Wit O'Toole obtains a tactical nuclear weapon from anonymous Chinese who do not agree with their government's stance on foreign assistance. They destroy the lander, but then Captain Shenzu arrives and places Mazer under arrest. Meanwhile, Victor and Imala (an attorney assigned to Victor upon his unauthorized arrival) manage to drift close to the Formic ship, using a disguised ship provided by Lem Jukes (the only son of the richest man alive) to avoid being destroyed. Victor breaks into the alien ship through a gun port.

In a racing career which lasted from October 1834 until October 1836 she won ten of her eleven races. After being successful in her only race as a two-year-old, she defeated the 1000 Guineas winner Preserve in the Oaks on her three-year-old debut. Later that year she started favourite for the St Leger and won from a field which included Preserve and The Derby winner Mundig. Queen of Trumps sustained her only defeat a few days later when she was attacked by a dog in the closing stages of the Scarborough Stakes. She was retired to stud after winning all four of her races in 1836. Queen of Trumps died in 1843 at the age of eleven. She was described by a contemporary writer as \\"certainly the most extraordinary mare these our days have seen\\". Background Queen of Trumps was a dark brown mare with a white blaze and three white socks bred by her owner Edward Lloyd- Mostyn. She was sired by Velocipede, a highly regarded but injury-prone racehorse who also sired the Derby winner Amato and the 2000 Guineas winner Meteor. She was the sixth and probably the last foal produced by Mostyn's mare Princess Royal, a daughter of Castrel. Princess Royal was a successful racehorse, winning eight races in northern England as a three-year-old in 1821. Queen of Trumps was ridden in all of her races by Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Lye. Racing career 1834: two-year-old season Queen of Trumps began her racing career at Holywell Hunt meeting in Flintshire, North Wales on 14 October 1834. Racing in the Champagne Stakes over half a mile she won from three opponents meaning that Mostyn, under the conditions of the race, was obliged to present two dozen bottles of champagne to the members of the local racing club. 1835: three-year-old season Queen of Trumps did not run as a three-year-old until 5 June when she was one of ten fillies to contest the fifty-seventh running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse. The odds- on favourite for the race was Preserve, the undefeated winner of the 1000 Guineas, but Queen of Trumps, despite her lack of public form and looking less than fully fit, was well-supported and went off the 7/1 second choice in the betting. The race began after one false start and was run at a moderately strong pace. By the time the runners entered the straight, many of them were already struggling, and inside the final quarter-mile the first and second favourites broke clear of the opposition and appeared to have the race between them. Approaching the final furlong Queen of Trumps \\"shot forward\\", left Preserve well behind, and \\"cantered\\" to victory. The New Sporting Magazine praised Tommy Lye for his steady riding performance, and opined that he had done only enough to win the race, leaving the filly's true ability undisclosed. The Oaks winner's next appearance was at Liverpool Racecourse on 17 July. She started favourite for the Knowsley Dinner Stakes and won from the colts Hectic, Equator and Conductor. 'Queen of Trumps', Won the Oaks Stakes (the Winner of the Great St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster, 1835) at Epsom, 1835 by John Frederick Herring In the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September, Queen of Trumps met Preserve again, along with Mundig and Ascot, colts who had finished first and second in the Derby. The meeting was held in generally fine weather and attracted a large crowd, with much interest being created by the attendance of the heir to the throne Princess Victoria. Despite rumours that she would be \\"made safe\\" (prevented from winning) Queen of Trumps started favourite ahead of Hornsea, the Derby winner's reportedly superior stable companion. The favourite was not among the early front-runners, but Lye moved steadily forward and positioned her just behind the leaders in the straight. Approaching the final furlong the filly accelerated sharply, settled the race in two or three strides and won \\"without the semblance of an effort\\" by a length from Hornsea and Sheet Anchor, with Preserve in fourth place. She became the first Oaks winner to add a success in the St Leger and was the only winner of Epsom classic to take the race between Champion in 1800 and Surplice in 1848. Three days later at the same course, Queen of Trumps was made 1/10 favourite for the one mile Scarborough Stakes, despite carrying a seven pound weight penalty for her classic victory. She was given a \\"tender\\" ride by Lye, as her delicate legs were reportedly causing her discomfort, but looked likely to win inside the final furlong when a large bulldog rushed out from the crowd. Lye managed to avoid the attacking animal, but Queen of Trumps lost ground and momentum and was beaten half a head by the colt Ainderby. Later the same afternoon, Queen of Trumps was allowed to walk over for a sweepstakes over the St Leger course and distance. Queen of Trumps returned to Holywell for her final appearance of the season. On 13 October she walked over for the Chieftain Stakes over the Mostyn mile course after the two other entries were withdrawn. 1836: four-year-old season Queen of Trumps began her third and final season with two appearances at Chester Racecourse in early May. She won the Stand Cup beating the five-year-old Red Rover and then walked over for the Marquis of Westminster's Plate a day later. In June the filly appeared at Newton-le-Willows Racecourse and won the Borough Cup over two miles, beating Mr Ramsay's horse Vestment at odds of 1/6. Queen of Trumps' racing career ended as it had begun with a race at the Holywell Hunt in October when she defeated Lord Westminster's four-year-old Oswald in a two-mile Post Sweepstakes. Stud career Queen of Trumps was retired from racing to become a broodmare at her owners stud. She produced only four foals: * 1838 Prince Caradoc, a bay colt sired by The Colonel, exported to Austria * 1840 Earl of Richmond, bay colt by Touchstone * 1841 Princess Alice, bay filly by Liverpool * 1842 The Black Prince, black colt by Touchstone In 1843 Queen of Trumps died giving birth to a foal by Revolution. Princess Alice had some success as a broodmare and was the direct ancestor of many good winners including two Irish classic winners and the leading Canadian stallion Chop Chop.

Late one night, a beautiful young woman arrives at the local pub, and introduces herself as Florence Carter-Wood. She has come to Cornwall to study painting with the Lamorna artists and to join her brother, Joey, while also escaping the iron grip of her father. Gilbert is captivated by her straight away. Florence wishes to study sketching with AJ, and models on horseback for one of his paintings ('The Morning Ride'). She forms a bond with Gilbert, even inviting him to meet her father when he visits. Gilbert writes in his diary a record of all his meetings with Florence, and invites her to the races. Not long after Gilbert decides to propose, but he is interrupted by AJ before he is able to ask Florence to marry him. A few days later, AJ himself proposes to Florence, who accepts excitedly. As the wedding approaches, AJ starts to be unkind to Florence. AJ invites Florence and Gilbert to an exhibition at the Royal Academy, where his portrait of Florence is displayed alongside two other paintings of his: a gypsy woman, and of Dolly, a local woman who models frequently for the Lamorna group. Florence is embarrassed to see her painting so prominently displayed next to portraits of other women, and she confides in Gilbert that she might now regret having accepted AJ so lightly. At the wedding ceremony, she asks AJ to remove her portrait; he refuses, even gloating in his wedding speech that the portrait will remain in the Royal Academy. Despairing, Florence leaves the reception and goes up to her room, where she drinks cyanide poison. She staggers downstairs and collapses in front of her wedding guests. Gilbert attends to her; Florence survives the suicide attempt. Once she and AJ return to Cornwall, she asks Gilbert to look for a private studio space for her. Gilbert finds an abandoned cottage on the cliffside. Florence returns home to pack up her equipment to move into the cottage, but is ambushed by AJ, who attempts to force himself upon her. Florence escapes, and runs back to the cottage, where she is comforted by Gilbert. A few days later, AJ, Florence and Gilbert are having tea together. Gilbert announces that he has applied for a job in Africa, and will be leaving Cornwall. He argues with AJ, and Florence storms out of the cafe. Gilbert follows her down to the cottage. Florence and Gilbert kiss, and then make love. They continue to meet in secret (although AJ is aware of the affair) until Gilbert leaves for Africa. Florence realises that she is pregnant, and explains to Laura that the baby cannot be AJ's (in reality, Munnings claimed that the marriage was never consummated). AJ, overhearing a conversation between Florence and Laura at a party hosted by the Knights and realising the truth, shouts at Florence and calls her a whore in front of the other guests. Distraught, Florence runs away to the cottage alone. She commits suicide by drinking the rest of the cyanide poison. Two years later, Gilbert returns to Cornwall, leaving flowers at Florence's grave. He goes to speak to Harold, who gives him a package with a note addressed to him from AJ. Gilbert walks down to the cottage, opening the parcel - AJ's portrait of Florence on horseback - and hangs it above the fireplace. The film ends by stating that AJ never returned to Lamorna, but became one of the most celebrated artists of his generation and President of the Royal Academy; Laura and Harold Knight were both elected to the Royal Academy; Florence's brother, Joey, was killed in France in 1915; and Gilbert Evans stayed in Lamorna, and that the painting of Florence hung in his house for the rest of his life. Cast * Dominic Cooper as AJ Munnings * Dan Stevens as Gilbert Evans * Emily Browning as Florence Carter-Wood * Hattie Morahan as Laura Knight * Shaun Dingwall as Harold Knight * Mia Austen as Dolly * Max Deacon as Joey Carter-Wood * Nicholas Farrell as Mr Carter-Wood Production Filming Summer in February was shot during January and February 2012. The cast and crew spent four weeks filming in Cornwall from 15 January. Shooting locations included Penzance, Lamorna and Prussia Cove. National Trust beaches Holywell and Porthcurno provided \\"a dramatic setting\\" for a horse-race sequence and a beach party scene respectively. Producer Jeremy Cowdrey explained \\"We could have filmed it anywhere in the world but we were determined to do it here, where it all happened. It's a true story and, because it's about a Bohemian artists' colony, the exciting thing is to recreate it, splash Cornwall and bring the county alive.\\" Music In September 2012, Rick Schultz from The Jewish Journal revealed that English composer and conductor Benjamin Wallfisch would be composing the musical score of the film. Wallfisch had not read the novel prior to being asked to score the film. Speaking to Classic FM's Sam Pittis, Wallfisch said that it was clear to him from the start that the score had to be something emotional and thematic. He also wanted to capture the beauty of the location where the film is set and tell stories through the music. The score is played by the London Chamber Orchestra and features piano solos by Yuja Wang. Wallfisch thought Wang would be perfect to play on the score and he approached her with some of the pieces he had composed. Wang agreed to come aboard and during the recording sessions, Wallfisch was so impressed with her playing that he wrote her a solo piano suite of all the main themes. The score to Summer in February was released by Decca Records in the UK on 24 June 2013. The track listing for the album is as follows: Reception Box office Summer in February entered the box office chart at number 11 after grossing ¬£74,898 in its opening weekend for a per-cinema average of ¬£1,170 in 64 cinemas. Critical response Summer in February has received mostly negative reviews from critics. Film review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes classified the film as \\"rotten\\" with a 31% approval rating among 38 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.6/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"It boasts beautiful scenery, but in every other respect, Summer in February is a painfully bland period drama.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 22%, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Stella Papamichael from Digital Spy gave the film three out of five stars and commented \\"The film itself is no masterwork, but it has a certain irresistible undertow.\\" Papamichael thought that Menaul and Smith seemed unsure when it came to the scenes in between documented incidents and called the dialogue \\"serviceable\\". Anna Smith, writing for Empire, also awarded the film three stars and she stated \\"While the melodrama occasionally grates, this works as a raw romance and an intriguing glimpse of a bold and brash artist ahead of his time.\\" Total Film's Tom Dawson gave Summer in February a mixed review, saying \\"Though it struggles to transcend its Sunday-TV feel, Christopher Menaul's film boasts sturdy turns from its three leads, while the outdoor lensing is a breath of fresh air.\\" Michael Hann from The Guardian writes \\"Proof that truth is duller than fiction comes with this tale of real events in the Lamorna artists' colony in Cornwall in the months before the first world war.\\" He also thought Browning's role was underwritten. During her review, Tara Brady from The Irish Times, thought the film was like \\"Downton Abbey stripped of charm and lobotomised.\\" The Independent's Anthony Quinn felt that the film \\"struggles to rise above the blandness of a Sunday teatime serial\\", where \\"sudden bursts of drama fizzle like damp fireworks\\". Derek Malcolm from the London Evening Standard lamented that the film \\"seems to be much ado about nothing very much, despite the pleasing performances and scenery,\\" jibing that his father's \\"painted horse, if only he could speak, could probably tell [him] more about Munnings the artist than Summer in February does.\\" References External links  Category:2013 films Category:British films Category:British romantic drama films Category:Films set in Cornwall Category:Films directed by Christopher Menaul Category:2013 romantic drama films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films about fictional painters Category:Films scored by Benjamin Wallfisch Category:2013 drama films ","title":"Summer in February"},{"id":"39084305","text":"Trechus artemisiae is a species of ground beetle in the subfamily Trechinae.

A Unique Partnership: Walter and Emilie Spivey, page 157 The dam formed what was promoted as the largest privately owned lake in the state of Georgia. Lake Arrowhead in Waleska, Georgia is also promoted as the largest private lake in Georgia. Georgia Department of Natural Resources records indicate that Lake Spivey is 600 acres and Lake Arrowhead is 450 acres at normal pool level. Development and use Lake Spivey shoreline in 2012The Spiveys also created a peach orchard, residential developments around the lake, and Lake Spivey Park on the property. The park opened in June 1959.Marshall, Elisabeth Hulsey (1991). A Unique Partnership: Walter and Emilie Spivey, page 177 For years in the 1960s the park served as the venue for professional water skiing shows. In 1963 and 1964 the lake was the venue for the now defunct National Outboard Association (NOA) National championship boat races.Marshall, Elisabeth Hulsey (1991). A Unique Partnership: Walter and Emilie Spivey, page 202-203 Lake Spivey was the backdrop for numerous concerts in the late 1960s and early 1970s including performances by the bands Pink Floyd, Blue √ñyster Cult, Chicago, Freddie King, Lynyrd Skynyrd, BB King, Ike and Tina Turner, and ZZ Top. The lake was the location filming for the movie The Legend of Blood Mountain (1965) starring George Ellis and Erin Fleming. Burt Reynolds lived on the lake during the filming of Smokey and the Bandit (1977) in Jonesboro. Located in the suburbs 20 miles south of downtown Atlanta, Lake Spivey is also 20 miles from Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (14 miles to the new International Terminal) and less than 15 miles from the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton. Lake Spivey was originally developed with seven residential communities; Lake Spivey Estates, Lost Valley, Bay View, South Bay, The Landings, Forest Estates, and North Shore.Marshall, Elisabeth Hulsey (1991). A Unique Partnership: Walter and Emilie Spivey, page 224 An eighth community, Edgewater on Lake Spivey, was created in 1997 on property once occupied by the lake clubhouse. Ownership In 1984 the lake was deeded by Emilie Spivey to the Lake Spivey Civic Association which owns and manages the lake today. Members of the association include only property owners from the eight communities around the lake. Each community has either one central marina or several smaller mooring strips located around the lake for access and docking. The lake has no public access.

Outflow from the lake is through Rum Creek. Rum Creek flows into Little Cotton Indian Creek and the Clayton County Reservoir in Henry County. From the Clayton County Reservoir, Little Cotton Indian Creek flows into Big Cotton Indian Creek. Big Cotton Indian Creek flows into the South River and Lake Jackson. These are all part of the Ocmulgee River watershed. Recreation Lake Spivey fireworks show in 2010Recreational boating on the lake is restricted by the Lake Spivey Civic Association to a 40-mph speed limit during day-light hours and 5-mph after sunset. Residents enjoy cruising with pontoon boats, jet skiing, water skiing, wakeboarding, canoeing, kayaking, tubing, swimming, and fishing. Every Fourth of July the civic association puts on a fireworks display which residents enjoy from their boats and along the shoreline. A slalom water skiing course is permanently located near the dam. Water skiers can typically be seen on the course during the summer months when the lack of wind makes for ideal conditions. Lake Spivey is tied as the location for the Georgia state record for the largest black crappie caught. Hooked by Steve Cheek in 1975, the fish weighed 4 lbs 4 oz.Georgia Department of Natural Resources - Wildlife Resources Division http://www.georgiawildlife.com/node/162 In 2006 the community worked with United States Postal Service officials to allow the city, state, and Zip+4 last line mailing address of \\"Lake Spivey, GA 30236+4\\" in addition to the previously accepted \\"Jonesboro, GA 30236+4\\". In 2008 the Lake Spivey Road Race was created to promote the neighborhoods around the lake. The annual foot race, which takes place in November, features a 5K and 15K course. Participants on the 15K course run the circumference of Lake Spivey and Lake Jodeco. Both courses are USA Track & Field (USATF) certified and provide a challenge to runners as the topography is quite hilly. The USATF course numbers are GA09021WC for the 5K and GA08011WC for the 15K. During the 2009-2010 regular session the General Assembly of Georgia approved that the portion of Georgia State Route 138 between Interstate 675 and the limits of the City of Jonesboro be designated the Lake Spivey Parkway. In 2011 the civic association created green space at the west most portion of the lake for use by residents and their guests. In 2013 and 2014 Lake Spivey played host to the Swim Across America, Atlanta open water swim charity event to raise funds for cancer research. The lake communities are bordered by the Clayton County International Park, Reid Stephens Heritage Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, and Lake Spivey Country Club to the north, and Lake Jodeco to the south.

Enlistment was limited to former members of the British Armed Forces between the ages of 45 and 60. The scheme was established in 1936, during rearmament prior to World War II. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, the National Defence Companies were called up for service and became the basis of the Home Service Battalions. Establishment After the end of World War I, responsibility for home defence on land rested with the Territorial Army and also the Royal Defence Corps which consisted of regular army soldiers who were too old or unfit for front line duties. With the rise of Nazi Germany during the 1930s, the British Government came under political pressure to modernise and re-equip the Armed Forces. As a part of that process, Duff Cooper, the Secretary of State for War, announced the disbandment of the Royal Defence Corps and the establishment of National Defence Companies that were to be a part of the Territorial Army. In a statement to the House of Commons on 21 July 1936, he said that the companies would be formed on a county or city basis, each being linked to their local Territorial battalion. Enlistment would start on 1 September of that year, and was open to \\"ex-members of His Majesty's Forces, normally between the ages of 45 and 60 years\\". Their role was stated to be \\"to protect important points in Great Britain when war is threatening or has actually broken out, but members of the force will not be called up until these conditions arise, nor will they be called up on account of civil disturbance\\". Cooper stated that the national establishment would be 8,450 officers and men, \\"and I have every confidence that I shall have no difficulty in securing this number of men in a very short time\\".Hansard - House of Commons Debate 21 July 1936 vol 315 cc228-9: TERRITORIAL FORCE (NATIONAL DEFENCE COMPANIES).

It is an erect to spreading shrub with smooth bark, spatula-shaped or elliptic to linear leaves and bright yellow flowers borne in groups of up to ten along a rachis up to long. Description Persoonia cordifolia is an erect to spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of with several to many stems arising from the base and has smooth, mottled grey bark. The branches and leaves are hairy at first but become glabrous with age. The leaves are arranged alternately, spatula-shaped or elliptic to linear, long, wide and twisted through up to 90¬∞ so that the leaves are held in the vertical plane. Some populations, such as plants near Yellowdine, have more twisted leaves than others. The flowers are arranged in groups of up to ten along a rachis up to long that usually grows into a leafy shoot after flowering, each flower on a pedicel long. The tepals are bright yellow, long with bright yellow anthers. Flowering occurs from November to February and the fruit is an oval drupe long and wide containing a single seed. Taxonomy and naming Persoonia coriacea was first formally described in 1928 by James Wales Claredon Audas and Patrick Francis Morris from specimens collected by Max Koch near Merredin on 30 November 1923. The description was published in the Journal of the Royal Soceity of Western Australia. Within the genus Persoonia, P. coriacea is classified in the lanceolata group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur. In the case of this species, it hybridizes with P. helix. Distribution and habitat Persoonia coriacea is found in the southwest of Western Australia, from Carnamah southwards to Lake Grace and Lake King and east across to Plumridge Lakes. It grows on yellow sand dunes or sandplains, or on sandy clay soils, sometimes over laterite, red sand or granite and occurs in heathland and mallee heath plant communities. The uncommon blue-breasted fairywren has been recorded using this shrub as a nest site. Use in horticulture Held to have little horticultural appeal, Persoonia coriacea is not known to be cultivated.

This museum shows the conquering of the city of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, by the troops of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror on 29 May 1453. The museum is located close to the point where the Ottomans breached the walls. Its main exhibit is a 360¬∞ \\"panorama\\" painting, (also known as a Cyclorama) of the battlefield at the time the walls were breached, giving the visitor the impression they are standing in the middle of the battle. The painting is made and presented in such a way that the visitor appears to be at the centre of a huge space rather than a circle only 38m in diameter. Sound effects add to the illusion - there is the sound of guns firing, of soldiers shouting and a military band playing to urge on the troops. Practical information The museum is located at the Topkapƒ± station on the T1 and T4 Tram lines. Design and Construction of the Museum Construction of the building and the painting of the giant panorama mural started in 2005, with 8 artists working on the mural. The depiction of the damaged walls of the city was based on a report on the repair of the walls by the first mayor of Istanbul, Khidr. The painting of the mural was completed in 2008. The museum opened on January 31, 2009. It was completed at a cost of $5 million and is Turkey's first panoramic museum. The museum is the owner of ideas and the coordinator of the project is painter Hashim Citizen. A view from inside the Panorama Museum This panoramic picture contains 10,000 figure drawings. The panoramic picture is drawn on a hemisphere 38 m in diameter. The picture has a surface area of 2,350 m2; the platform where the 3D objects between the picture and the visitor platform is located is 650 m2 and the visitor is in every direction II. One voice of Mehmed's thousands of soldiers and the Mehter Mar≈üƒ± encircle. Also pictured is pigment ink, which has remained untouched for over 100 years. The audience can experience a shock of up to 10 seconds on this platform in the museum. The first person to look at the panoramic picture on the museum will not be able to grasp the actual dimensions of the work because of their optical habits. This is due to the fact that the dimensions of the image do not have references to provide the concept, such as start and end points. While the museum is in a closed space, the visitor experiences a three-dimensional outer space again. The museum is located opposite the Topkapƒ±-Edirnekapƒ± walls, where the embankment passes. In the vicinity of the museum you can see the Topkapƒ± Walls and Silivrikapƒ± walls in Constantinople, the first Turkish soldiers.

The CUA invited Riccobono to lecture on Roman law due to the university‚Äôs special interest in that subject (it has had a School of Canon Law for many years) and because Dr. Riccobono was one of the giants in the field at that time. He was sixty-four in 1928 and ‚Äúwas at the top of an extraordinary career, with about sixty publications to his credit.‚ÄùRandazzo, supra note 1 at 123.

In the next several years, the Riccobono Seminar reconvened sporadically at various District of Columbia law schools approximately twenty times.Id. at 8. The Seminar‚Äôs initial difficulties were caused by a lack of funding. During the 1934-35 academic year, the Seminar's charter members recognized that they needed to reorganize if the institution was to survive. Therefore, they drafted a new constitution which was approved by the Council in February of 1935.Id. at 9-10. In a letter announcing the new constitution, the Scribe of the Seminar wrote: ‚ÄúThe new constitution calls for a change of policy whereby more control will be vested in the Catholic University of America. In consideration of this, the administration of the University will be willing to finance the Seminar within reason. It seems hopeless to attempt to finance the Seminar in any other way at present.

Once on a sound financial and institutional footing, the Riccobono Seminar provided a forum in which leading American scholars of Roman law presented and discussed the results of their research. Several noted Roman law scholars from abroad also lectured at the Seminar.Randazzo, supra note 1 at 124. The list of Riccobono Seminar presenters includes many of the best regarded Roman law scholars and legal historians of the time. Among these were : H. Milton Colvin, Roscoe Dorsey, Charles S.

Holding the Seminar in Washington D.C. also meant other notables were sometimes in attendance. The specially invited guests at one meeting included: Justice Pierce Butler (jurist) of the United States Supreme Court, Senator Joseph C.

Dr. Riccobono involved himself with the Seminar for several years. Upon its reconstitution, he reported on its work in the journal ‚ÄúBullettino dell‚ÄôIstituto di Diritto Romano,‚Äù which he edited. From the 1935-1936 sessions through those of 1938-1939, when the Second World War began, Riccobono offered extensive summaries of the Seminar‚Äôs papers and discussions in a special section of the ‚ÄúBullettino‚Äù titled ‚ÄúIl Diritto Romano in America.‚Äù These reports ceased in 1940.Randazzo, supra note 1 at 140. This gap in coverage of Riccobono Seminar activities was filled by ‚ÄúSeminar,‚Äù a special annual edition of ‚ÄúThe Jurist,‚Äù the CUA‚Äôs School of Canon Law journal. ‚ÄúSeminar‚Äù continued to publish papers delivered at meetings and to report on the group‚Äôs activities until 1955-1956. The Riccobono Seminar itself seems to have stopped functioning in 1956-57. As the ‚ÄúSeminar‚Äù noted, many outlets for articles on Roman law, legal history and comparative law had arisen since the war, making the ‚ÄúSeminar‚Äù unnecessary.Randazzo, supra note 1 at 142-143. There also had been a gradual decline in the Riccobono Seminar‚Äôs activities over the years. The annual number of papers delivered at monthly meetings dropped from eight in the 1943-44 academic year, ‚ÄúThe Riccobono Seminar of Roman Law in America, Academic Year 1943-1944,‚Äù 2 Seminar 100 (1944) to four in 1949-1950, ‚ÄúThe Riccobono Seminar of Roman Law in America, Academic Year 1949-1950,‚Äù 8 Seminar 93 (1950) and to two in 1954-55 and one in 1955-1956.‚ÄúThe Riccobono Seminar of Roman Law in America, Academic Year 1954-1955 and 1955-1956,‚Äù 13 Seminar 73 (1956).

The Portuguese first arrived in Chittagong around 1528 and left in 1666 after the Mughal conquest. It was the first European colonial enclave in the historic region of Bengal. Etymology Chittagong was the largest seaport in the Sultanate of Bengal, which was termed as the \\"Shahi Bangalah\\" (Imperial Bengal) in Persian and Bengali. The Portuguese referred to the port city as Porto Grande de Bengala, which meant \\"the Grand Harbor of Bengal\\". The term was often simplified as Porto Grande. History right The first court building of Chittagong known as Darul Adalat located in Government Hazi Mohammad Mohshin College is a testimony of the Portuguese settlement. On 9 May 1512, a fleet of four ships commanded by Jo√£o da Silveira from the Estado da India arrived in Chittagong from Goa. They were followed by several embassies from the Kingdom of Portugal to the Sultanate of Bengal, then reputed as the wealthiest region in the Indian subcontinent. He set up the first Portuguese factory in Bengal at Chittagong in 1517. Traders from Portuguese Malacca, Bombay and Ceylon also frequented the region. Some sources indicate that Joao Coelho had arrived in Chittagong before Jo√£o da Silveira. Many Malaccan Portuguese had come to the Bengal before Silveira in Moorish ships as traders. Moreover, some of the Portuguese settled in Pipli (present day Orissa) in 1514 and had visited Western Bengal. In 1528, the Sultan of Bengal permitted the Portuguese to establish factories and customs houses in the Port of Chittagong. A fort and naval base was established in Firingi Bandar. The settlement grew into the most prominent Eurasian port on the Bay of Bengal during the Age of Discovery. The cartaz system was introduced and required all ships in the area to purchase naval trading licenses from the Portuguese. In 1590, the Portuguese conquered the nearby islands of Sandwip under the leadership of Ant√≥nio de Sousa Godinho. In 1602, the Sandwip island of Chittagong was conquered by the Portuguese from Kedar Rai of Sripur. Portuguese pirates, named Gon√ßalves and Carvalho, ruled the island of Sandwip for several years. Each year about 300 salt loaded ships sailed for Liverpool from Sandwip. Sandwip was very famous for its ship-building and salt industries at that time. In 1616, after the arrival of Delwar Khan, a high- ranking Mughal naval officer, the Portuguese pirates were driven away from Sandwip and Delwar Khan ruled the island independently for about 50 years. The harbour of Chittagong became the most important port to the Portuguese because of its location, navigational facilities and safe anchorage. The port is very close to the mouth of the Meghna which was the principal route to the Royal capital of Gouda. Evidently the Portuguese found Chittagong a congenial place to live. By the end of the sixteenth century, the Chittagong port had emerged as a thriving port, which attracted both unofficial Portuguese trade and settlement. According to a 1567 note of Caesar Federeci, every year thirty or thirty five ships, great and small, anchored in Chittagong port. In 1598 there lived about 2,500 Portuguese and Eurasians in Chittagong and Arakan. The increased commercial presence included bureaucrats, merchants, missionaries, soldiers, adventurers, sailors and pirates. The enclave had a highly laissez- faire administration led by traders. Slave trade and piracy flourished. Major traded products included fine silk, cotton muslin textiles, bullion, spices, rice, timber, salt and gunpowder. A painting indicating the battle between the Arakanese and the Mughals in Karnaphuli River in 1666 in which, the Mughal received help from the Portuguese.The Roman Catholic Church was established in Bengal during Portuguese rule in Chittagong. The port city was the seat of the first Vicar Apostolic of Bengal. The Portuguese also encouraged intermarriage with the local population. In 1615, the Portuguese Navy defeated an Arakanese- Dutch VOC fleet near the port city. Piracy The Portuguese presence in Chittagong was ultimately ephemeral. The fall of the Bengal Sultanate and the rise of the Arakanese Kingdom of Mrauk U changed the geopolitical landscape. Chittagong became a major bone of contention between the Mughal Empire, the Kingdom of Mrauk U, the Burmese Empire and the Kingdom of Tripura. The King of Mrauk U massacred 600 members of the Portuguese community in Dianga in 1607. Subsequently, the Portuguese allied with Arakan. Portuguese-Arakanese piracy increased against Mughal Bengal in the 17th century. In response, the Portuguese ravaged the Arakan coast and carried off the booty to the king of Barisal. Slavery The Portuguese were involved in slave business and sold their slaves in Tamluk and Balasore, and in Deccan ports. Slaves were sold at Dianga and Pipli, and transported by ship. The Portuguese built a fort at Pipli in 1599 for prisoners brought by the Arakanese. In 1629 the Portuguese under the command of Diego Da Sa raided Dhaka and took many prisoners including a Syed woman, the wife of a Mughal military officer and carried her off in chains to Dianga. The prisoners were converted to Christianity. End of settlement In 1632, the Mughal army expelled the Portuguese from the Satgaon (Hooghly), owing to Portuguese association with the slave trade, kidnapping and refusal to support Shah Jahan. In 1666, the Mughal viceroy Shaista Khan retook control of Chittagong after defeating the Arakanese in a naval war. The Mughal conquest of Chittagong brought an end to the Portuguese dominance of more than 130 years in the port city. The conquest of the port of Chittagong was similarly aimed mainly at driving Arakanese slave raiders out of Bengal. The Mughals attacked the Arakanese from the jungle with a 6500-man army supported by 288 ships of war bound for the seizure of Chittagong harbour. After three days of battle, the Arakanese surrendered. Chittagong promptly became the capital of the new Government. This battle involved movement across both land and water. To combat the pirates' skill over water, the Mughals called for the support of Dutch ships from Batavia. Before the Dutch ships reached the coast of Chittagong, the battle had already ended. To carry soldiers, Shaista Khan constructed several large ships and a large number of galleys. After the Mughals took Chittagong, the Portuguese moved to the Ferengi Bazaar in Dhaka. Descendants of the Portuguese still reside in these places. Other settlements From Chittagong, the Portuguese proceeded to establish settlements in other Bengali ports and cities, notably Satgaon, Bandel and Dhaka. Satgaon became known as Porto Pequeno (Little Haven). Portogola in Old Dhaka hosted the city's Portuguese community. Spreading of Christianity Christianity spread across Bengal by the Portuguese traders along with the Christian missionaries. Although Christianity had already reached Bengal with Thomas the Apostle in 52 CE, the Portuguese set up the first Christian churches in Chittagong. The Portuguese merchants, most of whom were Christian, called Chittagong as Porto Grande de Bengala. In 1498, Christian explorer Vasco de Gama travelled Bengal. Legacy The descendants of the Portuguese traders in Chittagong are known as Firingis. They live in the areas of Patherghatta and Firingi Bazaar in Old Chittagong. There are numerous Portuguese loanwords in the Bengali language, including many common household terms, particularly in Chittagonian Bengali. The Portuguese brought many exotic fruits, flowers and plants, especially from their South American Brazilian colony. They introduced chillies, delonix regia, guavas, pineapples, papayas and Alfonso mangoes to Bengal. A Portuguese missionary in British Calcutta published the first book on Bengali grammar. The oldest churches in Bangladesh and West Bengal trace their origins to Portuguese missionary missions which arrived in Chittagong in the 16th century. Most Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. After the independence of Bangladesh, Portugal recognised it on 20 December 1974 following the Carnation Revolution, when it established relations with many decolonised nations. The Portuguese have had a great influence on trade, culture, character and language of the people of Chittagong. Very few physical vestiges of the Portuguese presence are found at present in Chittagong and Bengal, generally. Darul Adalat, the first court building of Chittagong is located in the Government Hazi Mohammad Mohshin College campus, is a structure built by the Portuguese. The structure is locally known as Portuguese Fort. Initiative has been taken by the Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh to preserve the vestige. There are few churches and ruins. Some geographical place names remain, like Dom Manik Islands, Point Palmyras on the Orissa coast, Firingi Bazaar in Dhaka and Chittagong.

He was eldest son of Philip Bell Hayman, clerk in Somerset House, himself son of Henry Hayman, rector of Lewcombe and vicar of Halstock, Dorset, and Jane, daughter of John Marshall. His brother was Marshall Hayman, barrister-at-law and a member of the staff of the Saturday Review, who was lost on the Alps near Zermatt in 1876. In October 1832, Hayman entered Merchant Taylors' School, and becoming head monitor passed with a Sir Thomas White scholarship on 28 June 1841 to St. John's College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. with a double second class in 1845, proceeding M.A. in 1849, B.D. in 1854, and D.D. in 1870. He was treasurer of the Union in Lord Dufferin's presidency, and was offered in 1845 a seat (number five) in the university eight, but family circumstances prevented him from accepting it. He was a fellow of his college from 1844 to 1855, and received the degree of M.A., ad eundem, at Cambridge in the latter year. He was ordained deacon in 1847 and priest in 1848.

On 20 November 1869, he was elected headmaster of Rugby in succession to Frederick Temple. Hayman came from Bradfield College and was a high church conservative - after Temple, who had been a liberal. Hayman had poor credentials and only a second- class degree; he was opposed by most of the staff. \\"Temple did nothing to conceal his hostility ... It seems extraordinary that he was prepared to behave in such a way towards his successor. ... Hayman seems to have been tactless and good at making enemies.\\" It is said that Hayman \\"left the School in rather a hurry and faced being homeless, penniless and with nine children to care for unless a suitable living was acquired for him\\".

Tradition suggests that passing infants through one of the holes will cure them of illnesses such as measles or whooping cough. Geology The Longstone is a large piece of oolitic limestone standing upright in a field, known as Longstone Field, east of the Minchinhampton village. It is high and wide, with natural holes through its width. Nearby, to the south west, there is a fallen standing stone which has been built into a dry stone wall, and may have once formed a stone pair with the Longstone. The area has numerous barrows and near the Longstone ornaments, flint and arrowheads have all been found. Lore Attempts to pull the Longstone out with oxen failed as \\"something\\" stopped it from being moved, so the stone remained in the field. The stone was believed to be able to cure infants of maladies such as measles and whooping cough, by passing the child through one of the natural holes. A myth amongst children at the beginning of the 20th century was that the Longstone would run around the field at the stroke of midnight. The menhir is supposedly the burial site of one of the Danish leaders, after a battle at Woeful Danes' Bottom, nearby.

His actual name is Muhammad Anwaarullah Khan Bahadur and was bestowed the title of \\"Fadheelat Jung\\" by the Nizam. Birth Imam Muhammad Anwaarullah Farooqui was born on 4th Rab‚Äôee Thani 1265 Hijri in Nanded. His mother said that in the course of her pregnancy, she saw the Islamic prophet, Muhammad reciting the Quran in a dream. Familial background As the name implies, Imam Muhammad Anwaarullah Farooqui is a descendant of the second Caliph of Islam, ‚ÄòUmar Al Farooq. Introductory education When he was 7 years of age, his father handed over the Imam to Hafidh Amjad Ali, who was blind, to memorize the Quran. The Imam completed the memorization of the Quran at 11 years of age. He received his introductory education from his father. He studied jurisprudence (Fiqh)and logic under Maulana Abdul Haleem Firangi Mahalli and Maulana Abdul Hayy Firangi Mahalli (Citation Needed). He studied some works of jurisprudence under Maulvi Fayyazuddin Aurangabadi as well. He studied exegesis of the Quran (Tafseer) Shaykh ‚ÄòAbdullah Yemeni and received his authorization in Hadith from the same Shaykh. Employment and resignation In 1285 Hijri, the Imam was appointed to a clerical position. After one and a half years, he was asked to record a usurious transaction. Instead, he tendered his resignation. His superior promised him that from then on such transactions would not be given to him. However, the Imam demurred and resigned. Jamia Nizamia On 19th Dhul Hijjah, 1292 Hijri, a meeting was held at the house of Maulvi Muzafarruddin in which the thought was expressed that founding an Islamic university in Hyderabad, which would provide higher and specialized education in Islamic sciences was the need of the hour. This proposal was accepted. A large number of scholars expressed the view that other than Imam Anwaarullah Farooqui, there seems to be none who can head such an institution. Thus, the Imam was appointed as the head of the institution.Islamic Studies, Orientalists And Muslim Scholars By S. Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi Aka Ali Miyan Appointment as a teacher to the Sixth Nizam After the martyrdom of Maulvi Zamaan Khan Shaheed, his brother was appointed as the teacher of 6th Nizam - His Highness Nawab Mir Mahboob Ali Khan. However, he had other responsibilities to handle as well. Thus, he proposed the name of Imam Anwaarullah Farooqui and Syed Ashraf Hussain and got it approved from the court. First, the Imam performed Istikhara and then accepted it. Thus, Imam Anwaarullah Farooqui became the teacher of the Sixth Nizam in 1295 Hijri. Pilgrimage Imam Anwaarullah Farooqui traveled to the two holy cities three times. The first time was in 1294 Hijri, the second was in 1301 Hijri and the third time was in 1305 Hijri. The third time, the Imam stayed there for three years. Apart from the necessities of life, he spent all his time in worship or in scouring the libraries. His book \\"Anwaare Ahmadi\\" was written at that time. The Imam also got many important Islamic books copied at his own expense. The most important among them are: Kanz Ul ‚ÄòUmmaal (a compendium of Hadith in 9 volumes), Jame‚Äô Masaneed Imam Azam, Sunan Baihaqui and many others. In this journey, his sister and son died. The Imam himself got very sick and his life was despaired of. Finally on the insistence of the scholars and saints of Madina, chiefly on the insistence of Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, Imam Anwaarullah Farooqui consented to return to Hyderabad. Appointment as the teacher of the Seventh Nizam After returning from the holy cities, Imam Anwaarullah Farooqui was appointed as the teacher to the Seventh Nizam, His Exalted Highness Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan. Minister of religious affairs After the Seventh Nizam was crowned, Imam Anwaarullah Farooqui devoted all his time to the service of Islamic sciences. However, the Nizam asked him to become the Sadr Us Sudoor for all Deccan. Though the Imam objected that he was past the maximum age of government employment (55 years), the Nizam told him that there was none more suitable than him for this post. Later on, the Imam was made the minister of Religious Affairs. Death In 1336 Hijri, the Imam developed some abscesses on his back. No treatment availed and doubts were expressed that it was cancer. At last, the doctors confirmed that it was indeed cancer. By order of the Nizam, expert doctors were summoned, who reached the same conclusion. Surgery was performed. After an extensive operation, the tumor was removed. The doctor congratulated the Imam that he was now absolutely healthy. The Imam thanked the doctor and asked him to check on him after Salaat Ul Maghrib. The Imam was laid on the bed and he fainted. He started reciting the Declaration of Faith (La Ilaaha Illallaah..). As the sun set on the last day of Jamaadi Ul Ula, the Imam died. Imam Muhammad Anwaarullah Farooqui was buried in Jamia Nizamia. Each year the ‚ÄòUrs of the Imam is held on 29th Jamaadi Ul Ula. The convocation of Jamia Nizamia is also held on the same date. Family Imam Muhammad Anwaarullah Farooqui was married in 1289 Hijri to the daughter of Maulvi Haji Ameeruddin Sahab. She died in 1304 Hijri on 26th Ramadhan in Hyderabad. After this, the Imam did not remarry. The Imam had two sons and four daughters. His first son, ‚ÄòAbdul Jaleel, was born in 1292 Hijri and died in 1295 Hijri. His second son, ‚ÄòAbdul Quddus, was born in 1297 Hijri and died in 1307 Hijri in Madina. Writings Imam Muhammad Anwaarullah Farooqui was a prolific writer. He wrote the following books: Al Kalaam Ul Marfoo‚Äô Fee Maa Yata ‚ÄòAllaqa bil Hadeethil Maudhoo Afaadatul Afhaam, Vol.1 and 2 Anwaarul Haqq Anwaar-e-AhmadiANWAR E AHMADI Haqeeqatul Fiqh, Vol. 1 and 2 Kitaab Ul Aql Maqasid Ul Islam, Vol. 1 ‚Äì 11 Maqasid-ul-Islam-vol-1 Anwar-Al-Tamjid-Fi-Adillati-Al-Touhid ÿßŸÜŸàÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÖÿ¨ŸäÿØ ŸÅŸâ ÿßÿØŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿàÿ≠ŸäÿØ as a Sufi The Imam took acquired the introductory teachings of Tasawwuf from his father himself and received the Khilafah (i.e. the authorization to accept and guide disciples) in all the Sufi orders. Later on, when he traveled to the holy cities for the first time, he again gave his allegiance to Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki and traversed the Sulook (the path to the Lord Almighty) under the guidance of the Shaykh. Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki granted him the Khilafah in all the Sufi orders without any representation from the Imam‚Äôs side and instructed his disciples of Deccan to seek his help in their spiritual affairs. However, the Imam himself never asked anybody to give his pledge to him. If someone would request of their own accord, he would humbly say: I am not worthy of it. Give your pledge to someone worthy. If that person would insist, the Imam would include him in the order. Usually, the Imam would accept disciples in the Qadri order. However, if a disciple desired to enter some other Sufi order, the Imam would oblige the disciple. If so desired, the Imam would give daily recitations and invocations as well. If someone had the eagerness to learn the sciences of gnosis and realization of Allah, the Imam would ask that person to attend the lessons of Futoohaat-e-Makkiyya.  Miracles  One night, a student of the Shaykh, Maulvi Abdul Samad was sleeping and the Imam was busy in reading. Suddenly, Maulvi Abdul Samad felt a certain uneasiness and woke up. The Imam requested him to get some water to drink. He did so and then went back to sleep. The next day, after the class, the Imam told some selected students that the previous night he had felt thirsty, but there was no one to fetch water. Then, the Imam had cast his attention on the person who was sleeping who got up and fetched water for him. Najeeba Khatoon, a student of the Imam was a great saint as well. She attended the lessons of Futuhaate Makkiyya, the great classic of Mohiuddin ‚ÄòArabi, seated in a separate room. She said that she had seen Ghouse Azam coming to the lesson numerous times. She said that once the Imam could not explain a point in the book properly. He would stop repeatedly. Najeeba Khatoon said that she saw a path cleared from there to the Ka‚Äôaba where Muhammad was seated and teaching. He said to his students: You please wait. This moment, my child Anwaarullah is unable to handle the text. Muhammad cast his benevolent attention on Imam Muhammad Anwaarullah. When the point was cleared with his attention, Muhammad became very happy and turned back to his students.

Early life  Bertei was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1955. She is the oldest of three children born to Katherine (n√©e Murphy) and Umberto Bertei. Her father was an Italian immigrant and her mother was of Irish and French Canadian descent. Bertei and her brothers became wards of the state of Ohio, resulting in a childhood spent in foster homes, a Catholic convent school for wayward girls and a reformatory in Ohio. Bertei never completed a formal education and is an autodidact. She began writing poetry at a very young age and was discovered as a singer by legendary Cleveland musician Peter Laughner, who mentored her and convinced her to pursue a career in music.  Career in music  Bertei began her career playing guitar and singing in the Wolves, her first band with Laughner. She left Cleveland for New York City in 1977 shortly after Laughner died prematurely of complications due to alcoholism. Bertei quickly became a prominent figure in the no wave art and music scene in NYC, playing Acetone organ and guitar in the original line up of the Contortions fronted by James Chance. While working as personal assistant to Brian Eno in 1978, Bertei took him to a series of concerts at Artists Space in New York, which resulted in Eno producing the iconoclastic LP No New York for the Virgin/Antilles label, featuring the Contortions and three other no wave bands. The artist Martin Kippenberger brought Bertei to Berlin in 1980 to perform solo at his SO36 club and on her return to the U.S., Bertei started the all-girl punk-funk band the Bloods with guitarist Kathy Rey. The Bloods are considered the first rock and roll band of gay women who were publicly out of the closet. The band toured internationally, opened for the Clash in New York and released the single \\"Button Up\\", a John Peel favorite on the Au Pair's label Exit Records in 1981. \\"Button Up\\" was re-released on the British label Soul Jazz Records as part of the compilation New York Noise, Volume 1, released in 2005. After the Bloods disbanded, Bertei worked as a DJ in Amsterdam and upon returning to New York, was one of the first solo acts to be signed to Geffen Records in 1981. Thomas Dolby produced her first hit dance single \\"Build Me a Bridge\\", and the success of the single led to an album deal with Geffen, but the company had alienated Dolby. Says Bertei of this period in the early 1980s: Back then, female performers couldn't be too wild, and certainly not outspokenly gay, even a little. Defying the rules had its consequences. This was exacerbated by the horrid reputation I had in the 1980s, some of it hyperbole but not all of it completely unfounded. Half-Piaf, half-Hemingway‚Ä¶ singing and brawling. Wrestling in public with quite a few demons that I should have dragged to a therapist. Dolby invited her to sing backing vocals on his next LP, The Flat Earth. Bertei sang a duet with him on the single \\"Hyperactive!\\" which became an international pop hit for Dolby. It was rumored that Dolby had vari-sped Bertei's voice for her high solo notes in the song but she proved the critics wrong, performing the song live on the Old Grey Whistle Test in 1984. She is alleged to have a three-octave range. During her years in London, Bertei sang backing vocals with various groups live and in the studio, including Culture Club and the Passions. She has written songs for artists as various as the Pointer Sisters, Sheena Easton, Thomas Dolby, Arthur Baker, Jellybean Benitez, the Anubian Lights, Lydia Lunch and Matthew Sweet. Bertei signed with Chrysalis Records in the late 1980s and recorded her song \\"When It's Over\\" produced by David Gamson and Fred Maher of Scritti Politti, with Green Gartside providing guest vocals. Her concept for the music video was a performance in a women's prison. A legal misstep on the part of the record company prevented the single from being released and promoted and Bertei went on to produce her own LP with songwriting partner Ian Prince. Her anti-apartheid anthem \\"Little Lives, Big Love\\" charted high in Germany. During this period she joined Jellybean Benitez for his LP Just Visiting This Planet, co-writing several songs and singing lead on the international pop hit \\"Just a Mirage\\" in 1987. She performed the song with Jellybean on the UK's Top of the Pops that year. Bertei continued to work as a backing vocalist, most notably for Tears for Fears' Sowing the Seeds of Love tour in 1990 where she also sang backing vocals for the opening act, Blondie's Deborah Harry. After a brief stint of touring with Sophie B. Hawkins as a backing singer, she moved to Los Angeles in 1993 and took a long hiatus from music to write and study directing. Since then her only musical outing has been with the Anubian Lights as lead singer in 2005 and Phantascope, a CD of co-produced and co-written songs on Nona Hendryx's label Rhythmbank. Bertei directed the music video for the Anubian Light's song \\"Wild Winter\\". In 2010 Bertei returned to New York for two musical appearances backed by several of her old Contortions band- mates and Bowie bassist Gail Ann Dorsey. Her live solo performances are extremely rare. She is rumoured to be working on a solo collection of new and old previously unreleased songs.  Directing and film  Striking a punk-waif look and attitude, Bertei was heavily involved in the underground film scene of the time, collaborating and appearing in films by the Irish filmmaker Vivienne Dick, Scott & Beth B., and in the feminist sci-fi film Born in Flames, directed by Lizzie Borden. In the 1990s, Bertei directed several period pieces for the Showtime series Women: Stories of Passion and a soft- core comedy feature for Playboy, Secrets of a Chambermaid, which she directed in super-16 mm with an ensemble cast (featuring Mary Woronov of Warhol/Chelsea Girls fame) and a minuscule budget in seven days. She refers to Playboy as her film school period where she was paid to learn the craft. Dick Rosetti, president of production at Playboy Entertainment Group at the time, called the film the best feature Playboy had ever produced. Bertei directed a 35 mm teaser for her original screenplay The Ballad of Johnny Jane, and on the strength of the teaser and script, a then relatively unknown Angelina Jolie signed a letter of intent to play the lead in the film. Amanda Plummer appeared in the trailer and Bertei had other film luminaries such as cinematographer Bill Pope and costumer Arianne Phillips committed to doing the film once the financing came through, but no company would take a chance on a feature film about gay women with an all-female cast in 1996. She continues to direct behind-the-scenes programs and viral videos in the advertising world.  Writing  Bertei has been awarded writing fellowships at the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, as well as the Albert and Elaine Borchard Foundation fellowship for the Tomales Bay Workshops, specifically to work with Dorothy Allison in 2010. In 2012 she ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to buy time toward her own writing work. Currently Bertei works as a ghostwriter and director in Los Angeles where she resides. She is also the U.S. contributing editor-at-large for the Caribbean arts and culture magazine 6 Carlos. Bertei launched a website in 2011 and based on writing featured there, has been approached to pen her memoirs. She also blogs for the Huffington Post.

Her published works included books on British sculpture and architecture. Life Whinney was the daughter of Thomas Bostock Whinney, an architect, and Sydney Margaret Dickens, the granddaughter of Charles Dickens. She was educated at the University of London, graduating in art history in 1935. She had published her first article in 1930, under the supervision of her mentor Tancred Borenius. Immediately after graduating she joined the staff of the recently established Courtauld Institute, where she did a variety of jobs including managing the slide library, and also continued her studies. The Courtauld closed for a year following the beginning of the Second World War. When it reopened in 1940, Whinney was effectively in sole charge, both teaching and handling most of the administrative duties. That year, the research she had done on 17th-century drawings for Whitehall Palace and for Worcester College, Oxford, in the collection at Chatsworth House, was accepted for a D. Litt. at the University of London and published in the Walpole Society yearbook. She continued to work at the Courtauld after the war, first under the directorship of T. S. R. Boase, and then of Anthony Blunt. Blunt described her lecturing style as \\"supremely lucid\\" Whinney was made a Reader in 1950. In the same year she edited a guide to public art collections in the United Kingdom jointly with Blunt. In 1957 she and Oliver Millar co-wrote the volume on the period from 1625 to 1714 for the Oxford History of English Art, Whinney contributing the sections on architecture. Then, commissioned by Nikolaus Pevsner, she wrote the volume on British Sculpture from the Renaissance to the Nineteenth Century for the Pelican History of Art, which appeared in 1964. She retired from the Courtauld Institute in 1964. She went on to co-write a catalogue of the collection of John Flaxman's models at University College, London, and a book on early Flemish painting. In 1971 she published an introductory volume on Christopher Wren. She was a vice president of the Society of Antiquaries, secretary and editor to the Walpole Society, a trustee of Sir John Soane's Museum and a member of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Honours In 1967, Whinney was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA).

History  Montanablue recorded an EP of material with Rainer Assman meant for release on Normal records until the German television producer and music publisher Harold Goldbach heard the recordings and promised the band he could secure them a major label contract. After an appearance on the German Musik Convoy television show (a first for an unsigned act) and an opening slot on John Cales 1985 German tour the band were signed to WEA and almost immediately began recording their debut album with renowned German producer Conny Plank. The resulting \\"Compliments and Roses\\" album was released in Europe and received fantastic reviews making Montanablue a critic's favorite in Germany and Benelux. The album includes contributions from Blaine L. Reininger and from J√ºrgen Dahmen who would become the bands permanent keyboardist. David Hudson produced a video for the \\"What She Needs\\" EP/single. Unfortunately being the critic's darlings did not translate into the kind of sales WEA had imagined and after releasing 2 more EP's on WEA and most importantly after the death of Conny Plank in 1987 the band lost any leverage it may have had and were dropped by WEA and Harold Goldbach. The band felt relieved, after having been burdened with such expectations from the outset and began work on a new album with German producer and musician Arno Steffen. After entering into a licensing agreement with Pinpoint Records and signing with the publisher Kick the band released their second full studio album \\"Chained To An Elephant\\". Once again the album and its singles (including \\"Zeb And LuLu\\" (a song Reininger penned especially for the band) received great reviews and airplay, but sales remained sluggish. Pinpoint released a live album titled \\"A Showcase Of Manly Delights\\" recorded by Thomas Stern (Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, Nick Cave) from the band's 1989 tour with Blaine Reininger. Montanablue and Reininger toured together during this period, incorporating Reiningers material into their own set.Corbisier, Isabelle: \\"Music for Vagabonds - The Tuxedomoon Chronicles\\", Openmute, 2008, pp. 296-322 These shows were very successful and the 500-1000 seat venues were inevitably sold out. The band parted ways with Pinpoint and were picked up by Choldwig Musik/BMG for what was to be their final LP \\"We Always Are Where We Go\\" recorded at the Conny Plank studio by Thomas Stern and Ingo Kraus, released in 1991. The band dissolved shortly thereafter.

Its first meeting was held on 7 June 1808, and its last on 10 April 1965, although there is evidence of an event known as the Irvine Marymass Races in the area as far back as 1636, initiated by the Earl of Eglinton. Bogside's flat course was an undulating, right-handed triangular course of two miles in length. Its jumps course, meanwhile, was two and a half miles round, with nine plain fences, two open ditches and one water jump. It was here that the first steeplechase recorded in Scotland took place on 25 April 1839. During its existence it hosted the Scottish Grand National (now contested at nearby Ayr) and twice hosted the National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup which now takes place at the Cheltenham Festival. Its other major race was the Bogside Cup. Among the most notable achievements at the course was jockey Alec Russell riding all six winners in a day on 19 July 1957. For a short time the racecourse had its own railway station, Bogside Racecourse. In 1963, the Levy Board opted to cease funding the course, declaring 'When Ayr is developed as the main Scottish course, racing under both rules, the retention of Bogside, only 12 miles away, cannot be economically justified'. Racing at Bogside ceased soon thereafter. Point-to-Point meetings took place at Bogside until 1994, and evidence of the former racecourse still remains.

It is an oval enclosure of around 40 large stones, all of which have fallen, together with three smaller stones. The stones are set into a slight bank.

The purpose of the bill is to redefine \\"state\\" in the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act of 1978 (\\"the 1978 Act\\"), to add American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, so that United States laws against tobacco smuggling would apply in those places. The 1978 Act makes it a felony to smuggle cigarettes from one area to another without paying the appropriate taxes. Smugglers trafficking in cigarettes transport cigarettes to jurisdictions with high cigarette taxes, avoid paying the taxes, and then sell the smuggled cigarettes with a large profit margin, while still selling their cigarettes for a cheaper price than those that could be purchased legally. Background A similar bill, , was passed by the House in the 112th United States Congress on November 14, 2012. That bill was also introduced by Rep. Eni Faleomavaega. The bill did not pass in the Senate and therefore died with the end of the 112th Congress. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Bill would amend the federal law () to include American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam in the definition of \\"state\\" for purposes of provisions prohibiting trafficking in contraband cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The 1978 Act makes it a federal crime to knowingly ship, transport, receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase 10,000 or more contraband cigarettes. Violation of the law counts as a felony with a penalty of up to five years in prison, plus confiscation of the cigarettes. The Bill is necessary to add American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam to the definition of \\"state\\" in the original law because they were not part of the United States at the time when the law was written. The Virgin Islands, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico were already included. Procedural history The Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on January 22, 2013 by Rep. Eni Faleomavaega (American Samoa). Representatives Gregorio Sablan (D-MP), Madeleine Bordallo (D-GU), and Pedro Pierluisi (D-PR) were all immediate co- sponsors. Rep. Donna Christian-Christensen (D-VI) was the final cosponsor, joining the others on March 5, 2013. Together, they comprised five of the six non-voting delegates to the United States Congress (the sixth delegate is the delegate from Washington, D.C.). The Bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on January 22, 2013 and then to the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations on February 28, 2013. It was considered on the House floor on March 5, 2013 under a suspension of the rules; it passed later that same day. The vote was 421-5. The Senate received the Bill on March 7, 2013. It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Public debate Rep. Eni Faleomavaega (American Samoa) expressed his support for the Bill, when he was speaking to Samoan reporters. He said, \\"American Samoa faces a serious problem of tobacco smuggling. According to a recent study, in 2010 alone, as many as 5.8 million cigarettes were smuggled into the territory. The study found that tobacco smuggling resulted in a loss estimated about $724,116 in revenues to the American Samoan government.\\" Rep. Gregorio Sablan (I-MP) wrote on his website that he supported the Bill because \\"cigarette smuggling is costing the Commonwealth tens of thousands of dollars in lost excise tax revenues and hurts local businesses.\\" According to the Representative, in February 2012 the \\"Commonwealth Customs officers seized 5,000 cartons of contraband cigarettes that would (have been) worth about $100,000 in excise tax revenue\\" if they had been imported legally into the Northern Mariana Islands. He argued that the passage of the Bill would give law enforcement officers in Northern Mariana Islands new tools to fight smuggling.

He came from a wealthy family with a tradition of military service. Jos√© Lu√≠s entered the army in 1836, during the Ragamuffin War, a secessionist rebellion. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and he fought in several military engagements at that time. Jos√© Lu√≠s held several positions during the years following the end of the Ragamuffin threat in 1845. His most important posting was command over the cavalry unit that served as Emperor Dom Pedro II's personal guard in the national capital, Rio de Janeiro. He also fought against the Argentine Confederation in the brief Platine War, which lasted from 1851 until 1852. In 1864, he led one of the two divisions which comprised the Brazilian army in the Uruguayan War. During that conflict, he led the initial invasion of Uruguay and fought in two crucial engagements that resulted in the capture of two Uruguayan towns. In the Paraguayan War, Jos√© Lu√≠s fought in most of its decisive campaigns. He was severely wounded during one battle and was left disfigured. Despite having served from 1864 until 1870 as a successful field commander, Jos√© Lu√≠s was repeatedly passed over in promotions and was not awarded a title of nobility. After the war, he held bureaucratic positions in military units before settling in the highly prestigious post of military commander of his native province, Rio Grande do Sul. He was also a politician and member of the Liberal Party. Jos√© Lu√≠s was seen by contemporaries and, after his death in 1879, by historians as a brave and able field commander. Early years Jos√© Lu√≠s Mena Barreto was born on 24 October 1817 in Porto Alegre. The town was the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, a southern captaincy (later province) of the Kingdom of Brazil, which at that time was politically united with Portugal. His parents were Jos√© Lu√≠s Mena Barreto and Ana Em√≠lia da Silveira Sampaio. Jos√© Lu√≠s belonged to a wealthy family of Portuguese descent and military background, who owned ranches and large cattle herds. The family had a long history of participation in the colonial wars fought with Rio Grande do Sul's Hispanic-American neighbors. In 1822, Jos√© Lu√≠s' family declared for Prince Dom Pedro (later Emperor Dom Pedro I), the leader in the struggle for Brazilian independence which eventually gave rise to the Empire of Brazil. In July 1823, Jos√© Lu√≠s' father, his uncle and his paternal grandfather (Field Marshal Jo√£o de Deus Mena Barreto, later Viscount of S√£o Gabriel), openly sided with Pedro I in his struggle with the Constituent and Legislative General Assembly that had been elected to draft a Constitution. The General Assembly punished the men by removing Jos√© Lu√≠s' father and uncle from their military commands and by ordering them to leave Rio Grande do Sul. His grandfather was barred from entering Porto Alegre. Jos√© Lu√≠s' family did not fully comply with the orders. They settled in Rio Pardo, a town in Rio Grande do Sul. After Pedro I dissolved the Constituent Assembly in late 1823, the Emperor rewarded the Mena Barreto and lifted the penalties imposed upon them. Little more than a year later, the neighboring province of Cisplatina rebelled and attempted to secede from Brazil in what became the Cisplatine War. On 24 September 1825, Jos√© Lu√≠s' father died fighting against rebel forces during the Battle of Rincon, leaving him an orphan at age 7. Early military career Ragamuffins rebellion Porto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul province, seven years after the end of the Ragamuffin War On 20 September 1835, a civil war that became known as the Ragamuffin War erupted in Rio Grande do Sul. The rebels, called Ragamuffins, conquered most of the province, including its capital, Porto Alegre. On 15 June 1836, Major Manuel Marques de Sousa (a loyalist officer, later made Count of Porto Alegre) retook Porto Alegre by surprise. Both soldiers and civilians participated in the town's recapture, and among these was the 18-year-old Jos√© Lu√≠s. Marques de Sousa handed over the command of the loyalist forces to Jos√© Lu√≠s' elderly grandfather, Army Marshal Jo√£o de Deus Mena Barreto, the town's highest- ranking officer. Jos√© Lu√≠s joined the army as 1st Cadet in the 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry. Jos√© Lu√≠s fought in small battles on 30 June and 20 July against Ragamuffins forces besieging Porto Alegre, and he saw action again on 6 September near the town of Capela Grande (today's Viam√£o). In 1837, he fought in further engagements: on 10 January near the town of Rio Pardo and on 25 June and 29 September near Porto Alegre. He was promoted to alferes (modern-day second lieutenant) on 28 August 1838. On 2 December 1839, Jos√© Lu√≠s was transferred from the 2nd Regiment to the 3rd Regiment of Light Cavalry and raised to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant). The imperial forces slowly regained ground, and by the early 1840s, the Ragamuffins were on the run. Jos√© Lu√≠s was promoted to brevet (acting) captain on 7 May 1842, and this commission was made permanent on 23 July 1844. After the war ended in March 1845, he was transferred to the 5th brigade and raised to major. On 23 December, he was moved to the 3rd brigade. Platine War In the years that followed, Jos√© Lu√≠s remained in the 3rd brigade. He was given a leave from 8 January 1848 until 8 May. He was next appointed to a bureaucratic position charged with administrative duties for the 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry on 23 May. Jos√© Lu√≠s received a promotion to brevet major on 30 August 1849. In January 1850, he marched to Bag√©, and later to Quaraim, to maintain order after a series of disturbances broke out in those regions. Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay (former Cisplatina) and dissident Argentine provinces. A Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The 4th Regiment was of Light Cavalry part of this expedition, serving under the 1st Division. The Brazilians were victorious, and Jos√© Lu√≠s was rewarded with confirmation in the rank of major on 19 June 1852. On 15 July 1854, Jos√© Lu√≠s was promoted to lieutenant colonel and transferred to the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which served as Emperor Dom Pedro II's personal guard in the national capital, Rio de Janeiro. He became the regiment's interim commander from 22 February 1855 until 1 August. Upon leaving that position, he was praised by the Emperor for his organizing and leadership skills as head of the unit. Jos√© Lu√≠s requested permission to study in the Military College and take its cavalry course, but in February 1856, his request was declined. It was considered inappropriate to have a lieutenant colonel studying among cadets. Jos√© Lu√≠s was promoted to colonel on 2 December, receiving the command of the 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry, and was stationed to Rio Grande do Sul. On 14 March 1858, he was assigned command over the Jaguar√£o frontier (a military district in Rio Grande do Sul). On 3 July 1860, he was transferred to the command of the S√£o Borja frontier, where he remained until 1862. Southern wars Invasion of Uruguay siege of Paysand√∫, 1865 On 15 February 1864, Jos√© Lu√≠s was given a four months leave to treat his health. He returned to active duty and was raised to the rank of brigadier on 29 July. A few months later, in October, he received orders to invade Uruguay at the head of a brigade composed of one infantry battalion and two cavalry corps. Another civil war had erupted in Uruguay between its Blanco Party and Colorado Party. The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. The Brazilian government decided to intervene and mobilized an army. Brazil expected Jos√© Lu√≠s' small force to begin operations while its main army was being brought up to full strength. Jos√© Lu√≠s' brigade began its advance on 12 October 1864. Two days later, near the Brazilian town of Jaguar√£o, the force invaded Uruguay's Cerro Largo Department. The Blancos attacked the Brazilian force during its march in several skirmishes, but was unable to prevent its progress. On 16 October, the brigade entered Melo unopposed. The town was the capital of Cerro Largo and had been abandoned by the Blancos. The brigade withdrew to rendezvous with the main army on 24 October, after handing over control of Melo to the Uruguayan Colorados.See: * . * . * . A few days previously, on 20 October, Brazil's Vice-Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then- Baron of Tamandar√©) had formed a secret anti-Blancos alliance with Uruguay's Brigadier General Venancio Flores, leader of the Colorados.See: * . * . On 1 November 1864, Jos√© Lu√≠s was appointed commander of the 2nd Division in the main Brazilian army, which by then was called the \\"Army of the South\\" and led by his uncle Field Marshal Jo√£o Prop√≠cio Mena Barreto (later Baron of S√£o Gabriel). The Army of the South invaded Uruguay on 1 December. Jos√© Lu√≠s took part in the siege of the Uruguayan town of Paysand√∫, which fell on 2 January 1865. The Brazilian army and the allied Colorados force then besieged the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo. Before any attack upon the city could be launched, the Blancos capitulated, ending the conflict. War against Paraguay The Battle of Potrero Sauce, 18 July 1866 An unintended consequence of the attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. Jos√© Lu√≠s served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, Jos√© Lu√≠s was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyut√≠ on 24 May. At Tuyut√≠ Jos√© Lu√≠s was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars that made him look like he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, Jos√© Lu√≠s seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates. Jos√© Lu√≠s later fought in the Battle of Boquer√≥n and the Battle of Potrero Sauce on 16 and 18 July 1866, respectively. He was transferred to the 1st cavalry division on 19 January 1867. He fought in the Battle of Tuy√∫ Cu√© on 31 July, in the Battle of San Solano and in the Battle of Par√©-Cu√© (part of the operations to encircle the Humait√° fortress) on 3 October. He was moved from the 1st cavalry division to the 3rd cavalry division on 12 October. He participated in the 28 Oct. 1867 Battle of Potrero Obella.Hooker, T.D., 2008, The Paraguayan War, Nottingham: Foundry Books, He also fought in the Second Battle of Tuyut√≠ on 3 November. After the fall of Humait√° in July 1868, Jos√© Lu√≠s took part in the Pikysyry maneuver that resulted in the Dezembrada (Deed of December), a series of decisive victories over the Paraguayans. At the head of the 2nd army corps after 6 December, Jos√© Lu√≠s fought in the Battle of Avay, in the Battle of Lomas Valentinas and in the Battle of Angostura. Despite his having fought and gained victories in many battles from the war's outset, Jos√© Lu√≠s was not awarded with any promotion or title of nobility, except for receiving a few, minor chivalric orders. The Brazilian Commander- in-chief, Army Marshal Lu√≠s Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Marquis of Caxias), had a very low opinion of Jos√© Lu√≠s and considered him an incompetent officer. Caxias' view was not shared by other general officers, many of whom openly supported Jos√© Lu√≠s and praised him as a capable field commander. Jos√© Lu√≠s fared better under Caxias' successor, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, who held him in high regard. During the last stage of the war, in which he commanded the 1st army corps, Jos√© Lu√≠s fought in the Battle of Piribebuy and in the Battle of Acosta √ëu in August 1869. Later years and death On 10 April 1871, more than a year after the Paraguayan ended, Jos√© Lu√≠s was promoted to field marshal (present-day divisional general), the third-highest rank in the Brazilian army (below lieutenant general and army marshal). He was appointed on 24 April 1872 to the bureaucratic position of inspector of army units stationed in the provinces of S√£o Paulo, Santa Catarina and Esp√≠rito Santo. On 27 August, he became the inspector of the army units in Rio Grande do Sul. Jos√© Lu√≠s remained in that position until 4 May 1878, when he was named military commander of Rio Grande do Sul, a highly prestigious post. It is known that Jos√© Lu√≠s was also a member of the Liberal Party. It was common during the Empire of Brazil for high-ranking military officers to pursue political careers while on active duty. Jos√© Lu√≠s was first married to his cousin Maria Francisca Mena Barreto. After her death, he married Rita de C√°ssia de Oliveira Melo, with whom he had daughters and one son, Jo√£o de Deus Mena Barreto (who as divisional general would play a key role in the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that led to the rise of Dictator Get√∫lio Vargas). Jos√© Lu√≠s died in Porto Alegre on 10 October 1879, while still serving as military commander over his native province. He was given solemn funereal honors. Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, Viscount of Taunay said that Jos√© Lu√≠s \\"had much bravery, beyond competence in arms\\" and was a good tactician who remained unshakably calm in battles. Historian Gustavo Barroso regarded him a valorous and brave officer, the member of the Mena Barreto family who had most distinguished himself through his own merits.

These short stocks were intended to accommodate South Vietnamese soldiers, and the Military Model 77E was the first United States combat shotgun equipped with a rubber recoil pad. Military Model 77E shotguns were Parkerized with sling swivels and wooden stocks. Receivers were marked \\"U.S.\\" and \\"p\\" proofmarks appeared on both barrels and receivers. A few prototypes were fitted with bayonet adapters, but none are known to have been issued. A few Stevens Model 69R shotguns also saw service during the Vietnam War. The Model 77E gave satisfactory service, but proved less durable than the Ithaca Model 37. Breakage at the point of attachment of the buttstock to the receiver was the most common complaint. Though the Model 77E is most widely known for its Viet Nam era military version the longer barrel civilian versions were,and still are very popular shotguns.

Poul Abraham Lehn (9 October 1732 ‚Äì 24 October 1804), Baron of Lehn and Baron of Guldborgland, was a feudal baron of the Danish and Norwegian nobility and one of the greatest landowners of his time in Denmark. Biography His father was Abraham Lehn (1701‚Äì1757), an estate owner and collector of books and art. In 1731, Abraham Lehn and his brother Johan Lehn (1705-1760) were ennobled; this made Poul Abraham Lehn noble as well when he was born in 1732. After the death of his father in 1757, he inherited the estates Berritzgaard and H√∏jbyg√•rd on Lolland. At the death of an uncle Johan Lehn in 1760, he received the Fyn estates Hvidkilde, Nielstrup and Lindskov. Poul Abraham Lehn created the Barony of Guldborgland from his holdings at Berritzgaard and the purchase of Orebygaard in 1775, combining all of his possessions northwest of Saksk√∏bing. In 1784, Baron Poul Abraham Lehn acquired Lungholm. In 1803, H√∏jbygaard and Lungholm were converted into an entailed estate (stamhus) under the name Baroniet S√∏nderkarle for his daughter, Johanne Frederikke Lehn, whose husband was Frederik Wallmoden of Fuglsang Manor. The legal effect of a stamhus was that the estate could neither be sold, mortgaged or divided between heirs. In 1780 and 1784, based on his family estates, Lehn was made feudal baron of the Barony of Lehn and of the Barony of Guldborgland, respectively. Personal life On 22 May 1761, he married Erica Christine de Cicignon (1744‚Äì1796), daughter of Johan Frederik de Cicignon (1701‚Äì1765). They had the following children: * Johan Lehn (1763-1766) * Sophie Amalie Lehn, Baroness of Lehn and of Guldborgland (1764‚Äì1834), ‚àû Hans Rantzau (1764‚Äì1808), who adopted the name Rantzau-Lehn and inherited the baronies; issue # Margrethe Krabbe Lehn, Baroness of Lehn and of Guldborgland (1766‚Äì1789), ‚àû Hartvig Gottfried von Barner (1763‚Äì1811); issue * Erica Christine Lehn, Baroness of Lehn and of Guldborgland (1771-1804) # Elisabeth Catharina Lehn, Baroness of Lehn and of Guldborgland (1772‚Äì1802), ‚àû (1) Caspar Hermann von Krogh of S√∏holt; no issue; (2) Frederik Julian Christian von Bertouch (1764‚Äì1831); issue, who adopted the name Bertouch-Lehn and was made Baron of S√∏nderkarle * Johanne Frederikke Lehn, Baroness of Lehn and of Guldborgland (1775-1805) ‚àû Frederik Wallmoden of Fuglsang Manor.

Location Shap Stone Avenue is one of three major complexes of megalithic monuments to be found in east Cumbria. The stone circles, henges, cairns and other standing stones in the area are often grouped at nodes of communication routes - the monuments around Shap form an 'avenue' running to the east of the River Lowther along a main route to the north; the Long Meg complex runs alongside the River Eden; Mayburgh Henge and the other henges run alongside the River Eamont near its confluence with the River Lowther. The OS grid reference of the Shap Avenue site can be given as , but the actual boundaries of the complex remain in doubt. Some stones have been lost, some natural erratics may have been added to the monument in historical times, and the various early accounts of the setting by William Stukeley, Thomas Pennant, Lady Lonsdale and George Hall are not easy to reconcile. However, the avenue may be seen in the context of the valley in which it is placed. ClareClare,2007, p.83 pointed out that the view to the east is restricted, that there may have been a tarn close to the site, and that the southern terminus of the lines of stones may have ended at a stream. There may also have been a spring within the complex. All of these features are similar to ones found at the Long Meg and Mayburgh complexes as well. The Shap complex has stone circles and cairns to the east of it such as the Hardendale Stone Cairn, Castle Howe, Seal Howe and Oddendale. In addition, the northern focus of some of the stones of Shap Avenue 'north' appears to be a burial mound at Skellaw Hill, the southern focus of some of the stones of Shap Avenue 'south' also seems to be a burial mound or mounds.Clare, 2007, p.83 The avenue The actual arrangements of the original stones in the avenue(s) can no longer be determined (at least without excavation). Clare suggests that there were two avenues; one consisting of a single, more widely spaced, row to the west and north west of Skellaw Hill, and one of two rows, as Burl suggests, or a double row, more closely spaced, as Clare suggests, leading from a now lost stone circle at Carl Lofts (near the Greyhound Hotel), to the southern circle at Kemp Howe. The two avenues form an arc to the west of Shap village roughly moving in a north-north-west to south-south-east direction. He points out that the geological composition (pink granite) of the major, pyramidal-shaped stones (Goggleby Stone, Thunder stone) differs from that of the other boulders in the complex. Traces of eight stones mark the avenue which led in a northwest direction from the Kemp Howe stone circle. Four of the avenue stones can still be seen in fields to the west of Shap: , , (the Goggleby Stone), and (Asper's Field). From north to south, the following major features may be seen: The Thunder Stone The avenue's first major stone is the massive Thunder Stone () which is located 3 km northwest of the Kemp Howe stone circle, and is just to the north-west of Skellaw Hill. This stone was not set into the ground, but lies on the surface left by the retreating ice, so \\"may not thus be a part of the constructed avenue\\". Skellaw Hill barrow The avenue passes by the Skellaw Hill barrow, also known as the Hill of Skulls or Skellow Hill, (), a round burial mound. It is located 2.4 km northwest of the Kemp Howe stone circle. Asper's Field Stone The Asper's Field Stone is a massive boulder on private land, about nine feet high by five feet wide, that has fallen on to its side. It has two cup markings on the top, one with a single ring around it.Beckensall, 2002, p.107, 109-110 Goggleby Stone The Goggleby Stone () is the next one to be seen, just south of Asper's Field. It is located in a field down a back road between Keld and Shap. The Goggleby Stone is about ten feet high and has a cup mark on its north face, and an artificial shallow depression above it.Beckensall, 2002, p.107-111 The Goggleby stone had fallen, but was re-erected by Tom Clare, the County Archaeologist, after having excavated it.Clare, 2007, colour plate 1Barrowclough, 2010, plate 55, p.113 South Shap stone circle (Kemp Howe) The remains of the stone circle () lie on the A6 road opposite the former petrol station close to a railway embankment. The stone circle is badly damaged, the Victorian railway-builders having driven their line right through the circle itself, and only six pink granite stones remain in place. All of the stones are fallen. They once formed a circle with a diameter of about 14 metres. Dating and purpose Clare suggests that the avenues date to the Late Neolithic period (approximately 3,000-2,000 BC), based upon the evidence supplied by the Goggleby Stone excavation mentioned above. Clare also points out that the Shap complex is important because of the lack of a henge or large stone circle (as at Mayburgh or Long Meg). The layout, with its similarities to the other two complexes, plus the choice of pink granite for the large stones, suggests a similar ritualistic rationale behind the monument, perhaps extending over several generations.

Reception of hotel Astoria 1938 with ƒêura Ninkoviƒá (on the left) on the phone  Legacy  The concept of the functional and affordable hotel for increasing travel needs of business people really took off in Yugoslavia after the Second World War through increase in rail travel for trade and business and then in the 1960s and 1970s with the advent of air travel as well, showing that hotelier Ninkoviƒá had correctly anticipated the development of the affordable business hotel concept. Both, Astoria and Po≈°ta, are still operating today as hotels. It is a testimony to their strategic position that they are still two of the closest hotels to the main entrance of the Belgrade Glavna railway station. However, the area around the station, known as Savamala, deteriorated in character after the Second World War and became run down as private property was confiscated and enterprising individuals and businesses were replaced by communist state owned concerns. It is only recently since 2001, with the advent of post-communist private capital, that major buildings have been privatised and renovated and the Savamala area is re-establishing its respectability. Hotelier Ninkoviƒá's grandson, also named Djurdje Ninkoviƒá, has been engaged in long term campaigning and litigation for restitution of hotelier Ninkoviƒá's property which was forcibly nationalized by the Communist Government of Yugoslavia in 1948.

He was part of the bands Chelsea Bridge and the Angstones, but his career was interrupted by a serious car crash in 2004. Following that, he concentrated on composing, then made a gradual return to public playing. Career Frayne was born in 1957. He started playing the saxophone in his teens. \\"In the 1990s and early 2000s, Frayne was the premier saxophonist in Ottawa, his home town. He played in such groups as Chelsea Bridge and the Angstones. He had played with the Gil Evans Orchestra, Kenny Wheeler, and Toronto's costumed jazz cut-ups the Shuffle Demons. Outside of Canada, he played concerts in New York, Washington, Norway and the U.K.\\" In 2004, Frayne was involved in a car crash, following which he had a stroke and was in hospital for over two months. He had \\"partial paralysis and a left lung that didn't work\\", so even following recovery his saxophone capability was reduced. He therefore concentrated on composing music, including for his Dream Band project, the first, 15-piece, iteration of which performed in 2012. Frayne returned to small-group public performance with a quartet gig in 2014. He continued with such appearances and commented four years later: \\"After getting hit by a truck, you don't really care so much about what people think [...] I just play the stuff I really like, and feel good about it.\\" In 2015, Frayne led an octet and the second edition of his Dream Band. He became music director of the Ottawa-based JazzWorks jazz camp in 2016. Another iteration of the Dream Band had performances in 2018.

She was descended from renowned history painter John Trumbull through her father. She travelled throughout Europe when she was young. Beginning in 1921, she studied art in Rome, attending the British Academy in 1923. She settled in New York by 1927 and was influenced by early abstract artist Arshile Gorky. She also studied with Charles Webster Hawthorne at the National Academy of Design in New York where she befriended artists Esphyr Slobodkina and Ilya Bolotowsky. While her earlier works were biomorphic or pure abstraction, her knowledge of Byzantine architecture later infused her compositions with an architectural dimension. She continued her studies at the Grand Central Art Galleries until 1931. She later wrote that she became devoted to abstraction in 1929, \\"[A]fter happily painting these realistic things, I said to myself, 'What do I really know?' I knew the shape of my canvas and the use of my colors and I was completely joyful not to be governed by representing things anymore.\\" Mason married Warwood Mason, a sea captain, in 1928 or 1930. They had two children. Her daughter Emily Mason (1932‚Äì2019) also became an abstract painter. Alice Trumbull Mason took up poetry and corresponded with Gertrude Stein before resuming her painting in 1934. She helped found the American Abstract Artists in 1936. In the 1940s she began working at the Atelier 17 where she created etchings and woodcuts. She first exhibited her work in New York in 1942. Her works received little recognition while she was alive. After the death of her son in 1958, she struggled with depression and alcoholism. She painted her last work in 1969 and died in New York City in 1971. Two years later the Whitney Museum of American Art hosted a retrospective exhibition of her works.

Safety concerns On 27 June 2015 a serious outdoors dust explosion occurred in Taiwan's New Taipei City due to colored cornstarch powder, injuring over 500 participants and causing 15 deaths. This brought public attention to the possible health and safety dangers of airborne powders such as the combustible starch powder used by The Color Run. The Taiwanese government has since banned events islandwide involving combustible colored powder. On 30 June 2015 the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a joint statement that they will assess all safety aspects associated with the use of colored powder before granting approval for the upcoming Color Run event to be held in Singapore. Additional measures such as changing the colored powder to non- combustible materials such as colored water mist may be required before the event is given approval to proceed. Due to ongoing safety concerns, Shanghai called off its Color Run. On 2 July 2015, Shenyang also decided to call off its Color Run and promised full refunds to all participants. Hong Kong officials also considered banning the use of colored powder spray in public events, and the cancellation of two upcoming events that employed the use of these colored powders - a music party called ‚ÄúLife in Color‚Äù scheduled to be held on 25 July, and ‚ÄúThe Color Run‚Äù set for 6 December 2015. The Color Run has since returned to China where IMG hosted 5 events in 2016. The organizers of The Color Run have disclosed that the colored powders they use are \\"a combination of cornstarch, baking soda, and FD&C; dyes\\". They have said they are committed to staging safe and secure events, asserting that they have \\"not had any fire-related incidents in over 500 events around the world involving more than 4 million participants\\". They have also stated that \\"as a professional events company with highly vetted policies and processes, we conduct thorough testing to ensure the safety of our materials and their application, and we are confident in the safety of our events\\". However, details about the nature and extent of safety and health effects testing have not been publicly released.

A 3MV-4 spacecraft launched as part of the Venera programme, Kosmos 96 was to have made a flyby of Venus, however, due to a launch failure, it did not depart low Earth orbit. Its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere is often speculated as the cause of the Kecksburg UFO incident. Mission This was the third and last spacecraft prepared for a Venus encounter. The 3MV-4 No.6 spacecraft was originally built for a mission to Mars, with launch scheduled for late 1964. After it was not launched by the end of its launch window, the spacecraft was repurposed, along with two other spacecraft which were launched as Venera 2 and Venera 3, to explore Venus. Instruments The eight scientific instruments were: * Three-component magnetometer * An imaging system * A solar X-radiation detector * Cosmic ray gas-discharge counters * Piezoelectric detectors * Ion traps * A photon Geiger counter * Cosmic radio emission receivers Launch A Molniya 8K78 s/n U15000-30 carrier rocket was used to launch 3MV-4 No.6. The launch occurred from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 03:22 GMT on 23 November 1965. Late in third stage flight, a fuel line ruptured, causing one of the engine's combustion chambers to explode. The rocket tumbled out of control, and as a result the fourth stage, a Blok-L, failed to ignite. The spacecraft was deployed into a low Earth orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , an 51.9¬∞ of inclination, and an orbital period of 89.8 minutes. The spacecraft was named Kosmos 96, part of a series typically used for military and experimental satellites in order to cover up the failure. Had it departed Earth's orbit, it would have received the next designation in the Venera series, at the time Venera 4. Kosmos 96 was destroyed when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 9 December 1965. The Great Lakes fireball and Kecksburg incident There is some speculation that the re-entry of the Kosmos 96 (Venera-type spacecraft) was responsible for a fireball that was seen over southwestern Ontario, Canada, and at least eight states from Michigan to New York at 21:43 GMT on 9 December 1965. Investigations of photographs and sightings of the fireball indicated its path through the atmosphere was probably too steep to be consistent with a spacecraft re-entering from Earth orbit and was more likely a meteor in a prograde orbit from the vicinity of the asteroid belt, and probably ended its flight over western Lake Erie. U.S. Air Force tracking data on Kosmos 96 also indicate the spacecraft orbit decayed earlier than 21:43 GMT on 9 December 1965. Other unconfirmed reports state the fireball subsequently landed in Pennsylvania southeast of Pittsburgh near the town of Kecksburg (40.2 N, 79.5 W) at 21:46 EST (although estimating the impact point of fireballs from eyewitness accounts is notoriously inaccurate). Uncertainties in the orbital information and re-entry coordinates and time make it difficult to determine definitively if the fireball could have been the Kosmos 96 spacecraft.https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1965-094A - 27 February 2020 See also * List of missions to Venus References Category:Spacecraft launched in 1965 Category:Venera program Category:Satellite launch failures Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 1965 Category:3MV Category:Space accidents and incidents in the Soviet Union ","title":"Kosmos 96"},{"id":"39085291","title":"1969 Swiss referendums"},{"id":"39085298","text":"Peter Kiesewalter is a Canadian arranger and multi-instrumentalist who plays sax, clarinet, keyboard, and accordion.

He is most noted for his designs for more than 40 ballets or revues, including many of the early works of Sir Frederick Ashton and Dame Ninette de Valois. Early life Chappell was born in Wolverhampton, the son of theatrical manager Archibald Chappell and his wife Edith Eva Clara Black (n√©e Edith Blair-Staples). Edith, the daughter of an army officer, was raised in Ceylon and India; in pursuing a career in repertory acting, she moved away from her upper-middle-class roots and married twice to fellow actors, by the first of whom she had a daughter, Hermina, the second time being to Archibald Chappell, by whom she had two daughters, Dorothea and Honor, followed by Billy. Chappell was acutely aware of his 'd√©class√© origins': whereas his mother's brother had maintained a conventional upper-middle-class life, being a tea-planter in Ceylon and able to provide his son, Patrick (who was close to Billy and spent time with his aunt's family in school vacations) with a public school and Oxford education, Chappell studied at Balham Grammar School.Edward Burra: Twentieth-Century Eye, Jane Stevenson, Pimlico, 2008, pp. 39-40 England Census, Worcestershire, Balsall Heath. The National Archives, 1911. After his father deserted the family when he was still a baby, Chappell and his mother moved to Balham, London, where she pursued a career as a fashion journalist. Edith's daughter by her first marriage, romantic novelist Hermina Black, Chappell's half-sister, was living nearby in Wandsworth. Chappell studied at the Chelsea School of Art where aged 14 he met fellow students Edward Burra and Barbara Ker-Seymer forging a lifelong friendship. He did not take up dancing seriously until he was 17 when he studied under Marie Rambert, whom he met through his friend Frederick Ashton. Career Dance For two years Chappell and Ashton toured Europe with Ida Rubenstein's company under the direction of Massine and Nijinska. Chappell returned to London in 1929 to dance with Rambert's Ballet Club (later Ballet Rambert), the Camargo Society and Ninette de Valois's Vic-Wells Ballet becoming one of the founding dancers of British ballet. Throughout the 1930s he created more than 40 roles for Rambert and Vic-Wells including: * The Rake's friend in de Valois's The Rake's Progress * The popular song in Ashton's Facade * The title-role in Ashton's The Lord of Burleigh * The re- creation of two Nijinsky roles, Le Spectre de la rose and the faun in L'Apres- midi d'un faune Design His flair as a designer was encouraged by Rambert and for this he is best remembered. In parallel with his dance career he designed more than 40 ballets or revues, including many of the early works of Ashton and de Valois including: * Antony Tudor's Lysistrata * Oxbridge partnership Norman Marshall & Geoffrey Wright's revue Members Only (With Charles Hawtrey and Hermione Gingold at the Gate Theatre Studio, 16A Villiers Street - 1937) * Ninette de Valois' The Wise and Foolish Virgins, Bar aux Folies-Berg√®re and F√™te polonaise (music by Glinka - 1941) * Ashton's Les Rendezvous (music by Auber - 1936), Les Patineurs (music by Giacomo Meyerbeer, arranged by Constant Lambert - 1937) and The Judgement of Paris (music by Lennox Berkeley - 1938) * Giselle and Copp√©lia for the Sadler's Wells Company * Costume design for Ashton's Capriol Suite, (music, Peter Warlock‚Äôs arr. sixteenth century peasant dances) and La P√©ri (music by Paul Dukas - 1931) also * The Blue bird (The Enchanted Princess), (music by Pyotr Tchaikovsky for the Vic-Wells Ballet - 1936) * Frank Staff's The Seasons (music by Glasunov for Tudor's London Ballet - 1940) and the dance suite Tartans (music by William Boyce - 1940) * Mona Inglesby's Amoras (music by Elgar for the International Ballet - 1941) and costume design for Everyman (music by Richard Strauss, arranged from the original scores by Ernest Irving - 1942) His designs for Les Patineurs remained in the repertory and his conception for Les Rendezvous, although frequently revised, continues. He brought his vast experience of ballet design to opera, musical theatre, revues and drama, as both director and designer. Direction Chappell has been credited as directing the following productions: * The Lyric Revue (Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith and the Globe Theatre, London with Dora Bryan, Graham Payn and Ian Carmichael - 1951-1954) * High Spirits (revue) (London Hippodrome with Cyril Ritchard and Diana Churchill - 1953) * Sheridan's The Rivals (Saville Theatre, London with Laurence Harvey - 1956) * No√´l Coward's South Sea Bubble (Lyric Theatre with Vivien Leigh - 1956) * Arthur Macrae and Richard Addinsell's revue, Living for Pleasure (Garrick Theatre with Dora Bryan, Daniel Massey, George Rose and Lynda Baron - 1958) * Wolf Mankowitz's Expresso Bongo (Saville Theatre with Paul Scofield - 1958) * Frank Loesser's Where's Charley?

Military service At the outbreak of war in 1939, he was the first male dancer to join up, spending the duration of the war as a second lieutenant and entertaining the troops. In his book Studies in Ballet he describes an occasion in North Africa when his company had no transport and had to march to their destination about eighteen miles away. He used this story to illustrate the benefit of ballet training to legs and feet, allowing a middle-aged man to arrive fresher than men nearly half his age, who had only received the routine Army physical training. He also emphasised the importance of a long unbroken tradition and continuity in the training of male dancers. He was of the opinion that the war was a factor that had caused chaos in the Sadler's Wells Company and rendered valueless years of work. He contrasted the treatment of the ballet in England and in Russia, where male dancers were considered important enough in their work to be kept in it. Personal life He was invited by writer and lecturer on dance Peter Brinson to take part in a series of 8 lectures on 'The Ballet in Britain' at Oxford University where he entertained an academic audience with his thoughts on problems of ballet design. Other speakers included Dame Ninette de Valois director of the Royal Ballet, Marie Rambert, Arnold Haskell, William Cole and Douglas Kennedy He retired to his home in Rye and died there after a long illness.

A spacecraft launched as part of the Venera programme, Kosmos 167 was intended to land on Venus but never departed low Earth orbit due to a launch failure. Beginning in 1962, the name Kosmos was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically, Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth parking orbit as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn with a duration of roughly 4 minutes. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation. Spacecraft The 4V-1 No.311 spacecraft was the second of two 4V-1 vehicles built and operated by GSMZ Lavochkin, following Venera 4. Mission A Molniya-M carrier rocket was used to launch the spacecraft. The launch occurred from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 02:36:38 GMT on 17 June 1967. This mission was intended to be a Venus lander, similar in design to the Venera 4 spacecraft. The spacecraft became stranded in Earth orbit when its Blok VL, fourth stage (trans- interplanetary stage), failed to fire because the engine's turbopump had not been cooled prior to ignition, never departed its parking orbit, and was designated Kosmos 167.

Hurst (born January 11, 1937) is an American double bassist and professor emeritus of music (strings)  Early life and Education   Early life  Lawrence Hurst was born in Norfolk, Virginia, to Ruth and Harry M. Hurst. The teen aged couple was married in 1931 in the midst of the Great Depression. Harry attended night school to finish his high school equivalency diploma as well as apprenticing as a metalworker, a vocation which he followed for the rest of his life. The couple was not at all musical, but Harry loved the sound of the accordion. Hurst began his musical studies at the age of four when his father bought him a twelve-bass piano accordion at a local music store in Norfolk. He learned how to read musical notation from his mother, before he could even read English. His first music teacher was Gotfrey Fluxe, who was a violinist, but taught many other instruments, including the accordion. Fluxe would often play along on the violin during his lessons. Hurst believes this is where he first started to love the sound of the strings. Hurst was very successful with the accordion and at 6 years old auditioned for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, At 12, he performed on the Horace Heidt Show, which was one of the most popular radio shows of the age. He performed on accordion all the way through his time at the University of Michigan where he made several solo performances with the University of Michigan symphonic band under the directorship of William Revelli. Hurst‚Äôs passion for classical music was ignited when he saw a television broadcast of the NBC Symphony performing a Beethoven symphony under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. He was mesmerized by the magnitude and intricacy of the orchestra, more specifically the strings. He told his mother about this and she bought him an album featuring Toscanini and the NBC‚Äôs performance of Beethoven‚Äôs 2nd and 4th symphony. He was in awe of how anyone could conceive of such music. He told his junior high orchestra teacher, Nicholas Ricardo that he just had to play in the orchestra. Thinking he was too big for the violin, Ricardo gave him a cello. Hurst took cello lessons for a month or so until his father received a bill from the school. The cello rental cost on top of his biweekly accordion lessons was just too much of a financial burden for the family, so his father told him he couldn't continue playing the cello. He went back to his teacher and asked if there was any instrument in the orchestra he could play for free and his teacher gave him a double bass. Hurst began studying bass at age 13 with Nadine Derby through the public school system. At age 15, Hurst was appointed principal bass of the Norfolk Symphony, which at the time was directed by Edgar Schenkman, former orchestra director at the Juilliard School in New York. Schenkman also tutored Hurst in music theory and other music subjects prior to his attending the University of Michigan. About a year before Hurst left for school at the University of Michigan, his teacher suggested he study with a bassist named Alan Warner. Warner had just moved to Norfolk from Boston where he was a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Hurst studied with Warner until he left Norfolk to study at the University of Michigan. Warner was a Fortier student, and possessed a notably rich and voluminous sound. Anselm Fortier was the principal bassist with the New York Philharmonic, and was one of the great exponents of the French bow in the U. S. Hurst was inspired by his work with Warner. As well as his success on the double bass, Hurst was also very advanced in his academic studies. He graduated in December, 1954, from Maury High School as valedictorian of his class Upon graduation, he was awarded a General Motors Scholarship, which at the time was awarded to only about 10 students nationwide who exemplified the highest academic and extracurricular achievements. This award covered tuition, room and board at the University of Michigan. Hurst was also very active in the Boy Scouts of America. He earned Eagle Scout, with an additional Eagle Palm and was awarded the God and Country badge. He was also a member of the Explorer Scouts and the Order of the Arrow.Interview with Lawrence Hurst  University  Lawrence Hurst entered the University of Michigan School of Music in September, 1955, as a Strings Performance Major with a certification to teach. Being that his major was in strings, he was required to have a proficient knowledge of all the instruments in the string family, while primarily focusing on the double bass. Hurst‚Äôs double bass professor was Clyde Thompson. Thompson, like Hurst‚Äôs former teacher Alan Warner, was a student of Anselm Fortier. Thompson was Hurst‚Äôs biggest mentor and inspiration; he accredits him for most of his knowledge of the double bass. During his time at University of Michigan, Hurst was a very active freelance bassist, playing in a total of 6 different local orchestras in Michigan. He was also the manager of a student orchestra and a member of the school gamba consort. Hurst graduated magna cum laude, in 1959, and was a member of PhiBeta Kappa. He was awarded the Stanley Medal, the highest award to a graduating senior. Interview with Lawrence Hurst  Professional Career  Upon graduating from the University of Michigan, Hurst expected to be drafted into the Army to serve in the demilitarization and cleanup of Korea after the Korean War. He had heard about an orchestra in Europe known as the 7th Army Symphony, which was an army orchestra stationed in Stuttgart, Germany. In his mind, this was a much more attractive and enriching way to serve his country, so Hurst sent many letters to the 7th Army Symphony asking for an audition and membership.. He was accepted and served eighteen months mainly on tour with the orchestra. The orchestra performed lots of American music, as well as the classics, and performed in many of Europe‚Äôs finest concert halls and opera houses. This time was very important in Hurst‚Äô‚Äôs professional development and helped prepare him for the rest of his orchestral career. Soon before his last tour with the orchestra was over, Hurst heard that Georg Solti (later Sir Georg Solti), was to become the new music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in Dallas, Texas, and that they were looking to hire a principal bass. At the time, Solti was the director of the Oper Frankfurt. Hurst traveled 200 miles to Frankfurt to audition for Solti. He was given 10 minutes to play for Solti and after his performance, was offered the job immediately. Upon arriving in Dallas, Hurst discovered that the acting music director of the Dallas Symphony had also hired a principal bassist. The assistant conductor, Donald Johanos, was given the authority to re-audition both candidates and name the principal. Hurst‚Äôs bass was in transit from Germany so he had to borrow one from another member of the orchestra. He had a day to prepare and get used to the new bass before the audition. Both candidates played for over an hour and a half, the majority of the music being sight reading. Hurst prevailed in the audition and began his time as principal bassist of the Dallas Symphony under Solti. After 2 years, Solti left Dallas for a position as principal conductor at Covent Gardens in London, England. At that point Hurst decided to leave the orchestra and return to the University of Michigan to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree in Performance. Shortly after beginning his degree, Hurst‚Äôs teacher, Clyde Thompson, took a position as Dean at the University of Ohio in Athens. Hurst took over for Thompson as a faculty member starting in 1964. He taught not only the double bass students but secondary cello students in music education. He even co-authored an elementary cello method book titled Fundamentals of Cello Technique with Jerome Jelinek, a faculty colleague and professor of cello. Hurst remained an active performer during his time on the University of Michigan Faculty; he gave many recitals at the School of Music and was principal bassist of the Flint Symphony. In 1965, Hurst co-founded The Midwest Double Bass Symposium with double bassist and educator, Warren Benfield. Benfield was a member of the Chicago Symphony and Professor of Double Bass at Northwestern University. The first symposium took place on the Northwestern campus in 1965 and lasted for another 35 years; each year at a different university in the midwest. The Midwest Symposium was created so all the double bass students and educators of the midwest could gather in one place and hear the students play and interact with each other. In the late 50s and early 60s, Joseph Maddy began his founding of an arts boarding high school, known today as the Interlochen Arts Academy. In 1963, Maddy asked Clyde Thompson to be the bass teacher at the Academy and he agreed. Shortly after, however, Thompson took a sabbatical from the University of Michigan. Hurst took his place in teaching the academy bass students for that school year. In 1967 Hurst began teaching at the National Music Camp, mainly in the All-State program which was administered by the University of Michigan School of Music. At that time Oscar Zimmermann, a long time teacher at the Eastman School of Music taught all the other bass players in the camp. Every summer since 1967 Hurst has taught a large class of high school age bassists at the Interlochen Arts Camp, and since 1987, team-taught with his colleague, and long time personal friend, Winston (Jack) Budrow. Many students from the camp have gone on to become very successful bassists and musicians. In 1979 Hurst was appointed Associate Dean for External Programs for the School of Music in Ann Arbor, which meant that he was in charge of the educational curriculum of over 200 students and 24 faculty of the University Division at Interlochen during the summer months. He served as Associate Dean for 7 years. Prior to his appointment as Associate Dean, Hurst was chair of the String Department for 9 years. Once appointed Associate Dean, Hurst could no longer teach a full studio of 20 students, so Jeff Bradtich was hired as a second instructor. During his appointment as associate Dean, Hurst served on a panel for the National Endowment for the Arts, led by opera singer, Beverly Sills. He was also very active in the American String Teachers Association (ASTA) and was Chair of their National Solo Competition for six years. Hurst was very active in the International Society of Bassists (ISB), serving on their Board and organizing the 1995 Convention in Bloomington. He also served as president of the ISB for the years 1995-97. In 1985, Hurst received a phone call from Stuart Sankey, professor of double bass at Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. Sankey informed him that Murray Grodner, the other double bass faculty at the Jacobs School, was about to retire and wanted to know if he was interested in the job. Hurst told Sankey he was interested, and two weeks later Hurst received a call from Murray Grodner who asked him the same question. Earlier that year, Hurst‚Äôs Associate Deanship had been dissolved for financial reasons, and this, along with several other negative occurrences at the school along with Hurst‚Äôs immense respect for Stewart Sankey and Murray Grodner, led him to accept an invitation from the dean of the Jacobs School, Charles Webb, to give a masterclass on the IU campus and interview for the job. The string department and the dean, Charles Webb, were impressed with Hurst and Webb offered him the position on the spot. Hurst took this offer back to the dean at the University of Michigan School of Music but was not given a counter offer. Hurst accepted the position at the Jacobs School of Music and began as faculty in 1986. Upon his appointment, the dean asked Hurst to take over as head of the string department. Hurst was hesitant to take the position before he got to know the other 20 or so faculty in the department so he asked the dean to give him a year to get acclimated. After his first year, he was appointed the chair of the String Department, a title he kept for the remainder of his career at the Jacobs School of Music. Upon Charles Webb‚Äôs retirement in 1997, Hurst was appointed as the chair of the committee to find and recommend to the president of the university a new dean. When the new dean, David Woods, was appointed, Woods asked Hurst to act as Associate Dean for the academic year. In 2006, the Sarasota Music Festival asked him to be on their faculty. He has been in the festival until the present. In 2012, after 26 years on the faculty, Hurst retired from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music and was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus of Strings. Former students from both the University of Michigan and Indiana University started a scholarship in his name for bassists at the Jacobs School. A medal was also struck in his honor and is given to a deserving graduating senior in double bass performance at the Jacobs School. \\"His [Hurst's] students can be found in orchestras and musical venues all over the world, including the orchestras of Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Indianapolis, Atlanta, The Metropolitan Opera, St. Louis, Israel Philharmonic, Hamburg State Opera, and Gothenburg, to name a few. In 2000 his alma mater awarded him the Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2005 he was given the American String Teacher‚Äôs Association Artist/Teacher of the Year Award. In 2006, the International Society of Bassists (of which he is past president) gave him the Distinguished Teaching Award. In June, 2013, the ISB also awarded him the Distinguished Achievement Award.\\"  Personal Life  In 1961 he married Marlene Schneider, whom he met at the University of Michigan during his undergraduate years. They were divorced in 1976. As head of the University of Michigan Division of the National Music Camp, he hired Celeste Kiyo as his Administrative Assistant in 1977. In 1981 they were married. There are two stepdaughters, Kristen Linsday of Hilton Head Island, SC, and Katie Kiyo Diener of Bloomfield Hills, MI. He also has a grandson, Christopher Linsday, and two great granddaughters, Isabelle and Amaya Linsday. He has a brother, Harry Hurst Jr., and a sister, Crystal M. Gooding who is deceased. Lawrence Hurst currently resides in Bloomington, Indiana where he remains active in the Jacobs School of Music's double bass class. He spends his free time fishing, birdwatching, and doing crosswords.

TiLite wheelchairs are sold in 38 countries; TiLite is a division of TiSport, LLC, which is headquartered in Pasco, Washington. In 2014, TiLite was acquired by Permobil. Technology TiLite uses titanium for the frames of several lines of its high-performance wheelchairs. Titanium has the highest strength-to- weight ratio of any metal, it is highly durable, and it absorbs vibrations better than other common frame materials such as aluminum. These unique properties make it desirable, but because titanium is difficult to refine and requires expertise and precision in welding and bending, it is a more costly material. TiLite makes wheelchairs in both titanium and aluminum. While the company's titanium chairs are slightly lighter in weight and more durable, their aluminum wheelchairs are more economical and sufficient for most users.

He was a vocal opponent of the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons.Stout, David (May 26, 1996). Alexander Langsdorf, 83, Plutonium Pioneer. The New York Times Life and career Langsdorf was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He earned an undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1932 and a doctorate in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937. In this time he developed a continuously sensitive cloud chamber. After a research fellowship at the University of California at Berkeley, he became a physics instructor at Washington University in St. Louis from 1939 to 1942. Prior to World War II, Langsdorf co-developed a cyclotron for splitting atomic particles at Washington University in St. Louis . It was designed for use in medical research. During World War II, he worked with Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago on the Manhattan Project. Langsdorf was one of the designers of the first two nuclear reactors after Fermi completed the first sustained nuclear chain reaction in 1942. Langsdorf was able to produce a tiny usable sample of plutonium using his device. That sample was then used in the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945. Langsdorf urged President Harry S Truman not to use the bomb against the Japanese, but a plutonium-based bomb was dropped on Nagasaki soon after. He continued to urge against expansion of nuclear weapons. He helped found Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and his wife Martyl Langsdorf designed the 1947 cover of the publication which debuted the Doomsday Clock. Langsdorf also invented the diffusion cloud chamber and the reactor oscillator. Langsdorf died in Elmhurst, Illinois, from complications from hip surgery.Staff report (May 25, 1996).
