The stems can grow to 40 cm (occasionally 80 cm) in height but are often much smaller. Some forms have prostrate stems that creep along the ground while other forms grow more erect. The stems are dark blue-green, slender and rough to the touch. They may be unbranched or have branches growing from the base. The stem nodes are covered with a sheath that is marked with a black band and has dark teeth with white edges. The stems are tipped with a small cone, 3–4 mm across, which is usually green with a black, bluntly-pointed tip. Distribution and habitat It has a circumpolar distribution in the northern hemisphere, where it is occurs in northern Europe, Asia and North America including Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Its range extends south as far as the Pyrenees and Apennines in Europe, Mongolia and Japan in Asia and Connecticut, Wisconsin and Oregon in North America. It prefers open, lime-rich sites, often those that flood in winter. It occurs in dune slacks, mountain flushes and beside lakes, rivers and canals. References *Flora of North America.

It centres on Mrs Hauksbee, and begins > Mrs. Hauksbee was sometimes nice to her own sex. Here is a story to prove > this; and you can believe just as much as ever you please. (It is necessary to say how Mrs. Hauksbee can be 'nice', after the story \\"Three and - an Extra\\" which introduced her to Kipling's readers as a woman predatory on another's husband.) In The Rescue of Pluffles, Pluffles is a subaltern (2nd Lieutenant) in a regiment known (for a concealing nickname) 'The Unmentionables'. He is callow, and 'trusts his own judgement': and, at 24, becomes \\"bound hand and foot to Mrs. Reiver's 'rickshaw wheels\\" - that is a hyperbolic way of saying that she dominates him so that he is at her whim. Mrs. Hauksbee and Mrs. Reiver hate each other \\"fervently.\\" Mrs. Hauksbee learns that Pluffles has left a fiancée at home in England. She fights Mrs. Reiver in \\"the Seven Weeks' War\\", and finally wins by talking to him \\"after the manner of a mother\\". Pluffles and his fiancée are married. He leaves the army and returns to lead a happy life farming in England. \\"He would have come to extreme grief in India\\".

The hospital emergency department is a Level V Trauma Care Center, a Level II Cardiac Center, and a Level III Stroke Center; it serves its community, as well as accident victims from the adjacent major highways. The umbrella district was long known as \\"East Adams Rural Hospital\\", but on August 28, 2014, the Board of Commissioners voted to change the district's DBA to \\"East Adams Rural Healthcare\\" to better reflect the scope of its operations, in that the district was then acquiring, by gift, the skilled-nursing facility known as \\"Life Care Center of Ritzville\\", then an operation of Life Care Centers of America. In early 2017, however, the district elected to close the Care Center, owing to the great drain it was creating on District finances. The district is thus now operating the hospital in Ritzville, the medical clinic in Ritzville, and a satellite medical clinic in nearby Washtucna. The District is active in a number of regional associations and partnerships.

The cemetery is on a former cottonfield at the edge of a steep slope leading from Bolton's Ridge to the sea, near the Southern end of the Anzac sector.

Two cemeteries for Australian troops were established on the green in May. It continued to be used until December 1915 and the evacuation of the Anzac sector, by which time many of the graves had become elaborately decorated. A cricket match was played on the green (and photographed) on 17 December 1915, whilst shells passed over it, as part of the Allied attempts to conceal preparations for the evacuation of the Anzac and Suvla Bay sectors.

He is credited with some of the most extraordinary custom interiors and hand-crafted furniture in the United States. Sometimes working in collaboration with architect Frank Furness (1839–1912), he made pieces in the Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Modern Gothic, and Colonial Revival styles. Examples of his work are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  Background  Born in Langenstein, Hesse, Germany, Pabst immigrated to the U.S. in 1849 and settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he would make his professional career. The excellence of his craftsmanship elevated him above his peers, as did the strongly architectonic (building-like) quality of his furniture designs—often massively scaled, with columns, pilasters, rounded and Gothic arches, bold carving and polychromatic decoration. He was a master at cameo-carving (intaglio) in wood - veneering a light-colored wood over a darker, then carving through to create a vivid contrast. Some pieces were adorned with decorative tiles, others with painted glass panels backed with reflective foil. Elaborate strap hinges and hardware were commonly used, and sometimes the furniture was ebonized. His Philadelphia shop grew to employ up to 50 workmen, but the company's records do not survive. Of the presumably thousands of pieces produced by his shop over half a century, only two are signed, and very few are documented. Therefore, identification of his works must be done through attribution.  With Furness  Horace Howard Furness in his library at \\"Lindenshade,\\" Wallingford, Pennsylvania, ca. 1900. The Furness-Pabst bookcases are beneath the balcony at far right and far left. The lamps of the Furness-Pabst desk (now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art) are visible in the background, right. The most famous pieces attributed to Pabst are a Neo-Grec desk and chair made to the designs of Frank Furness. Created for the architect's brother Horace (and slightly altered from Frank's surviving drawings), they are now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Furness family papers document a set of bookcases created by the pair – \\"These bookcases were placed in position this day—February 18th 1871. They were designed by Capt. Frank Furness, and made by Daniel Pabst …\\" The bookcases are visible in a circa-1900 photograph of Horace Howard Furness's library. One of them is now at the University of Pennsylvania, others are now in the Barrie & Deedee Wigmore collection in New York City. A circa-1870 Neo-Grec armchair from Horace Howard Furness's city house, designed by Frank Furness and attributed to Pabst, was exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston in 1987. The newly formed architectural firm of Furness & Hewitt won the design competition for the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1871–76). The Philadelphia art-museum-and-school's original furnishings included a lectern, bookcases, and set of Neo-Grec furniture for the boardroom. Armchairs from the set, attributed to Furness and Pabst, are in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania. A director of the Academy, liquor baron Henry C. Gibson, hired Furness & Hewitt to redecorate his Greek Revival city house. The eye-popping Moorish and Neo- Grec interiors are attributed to Furness, and may have been made by Pabst.Henry C. Gibson interiors, from Wikimedia Commons. Gibson appears to have used copies of the PAFA armchairs as seating in his picture gallery.Gibson dining room, with picture gallery beyond. from Wikimedia Commons. His Neo-Grec library table – now at the Detroit Institute of Arts – is attributed to Furness and Pabst. Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. (father of the future president) hired Furness to decorate his newly built townhouse at 6 West 57th Street, New York City (demolished). The ornate Neo-Grec paneling, bookcases, cabinetry and mantels are based on designs in Furness's sketchbook, and their manufacture is attributed to Pabst. The pair is also credited with individual pieces of Roosevelt furniture.Theodore Roosevelt furniture, from . The massive dining table – with a base featuring carved herons pinching frogs in their bills – is now in the collection of the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia. The cameo-carved master bedroom suite is now at Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, President Theodore Roosevelt's summer home in Oyster Bay, New York. The Neo-Grec case for the Roosevelts' upright piano (with cameo-carved panels) and their library table (with oversized Corinthian capitals) are unlocated. The late antiques expert/dealer Robert EdwardsRobert Edwards Collection, from Winterthur Library. – who discovered the Pabst- attributed cabinets now at the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art – identified a Neo-Grec side chair (now in the Barrie & Deedee Wigmore collection) as having come from the Roosevelt library. A 17-year-old architecture student visiting Philadelphia in June 1873, Louis Sullivan, closely examined a house nearing completion at 510 South Broad Street, and decided that he was going to work for the firm that designed it. The next day he presented himself to Frank Furness, and was hired as a draftsman at US$10 a week. The Bloomfield H. Moore House was the most ambitious Furness & Hewitt domestic commission to date, and Furness's interiors – manufacture attributed to Pabst – were his most perverse. The egrets from the Roosevelt dining table reappeared, this time supporting the dining room mantel, but the house is best remembered for the nightmarish chimneypiece in its library. The tall and massive walnut chimneypiece featured compressed columns supporting oversized piers incised with stylized sunflowers, twin \\"hounds of hell\\" grotesques snarling from behind shields, a diapered and gold-leafed tympanum bisected by a center column, a crocketed pediment rising to a finial, and twin owls staring down from the roof. The Moore house was demolished in the 1950s, but much of the chimneypiece, stripped of its grotesques and thus about 3 feet (0.91 m) shorter, survives.Bloomfield Moore chimneypiece in 2009, nos. 257 & 258, from Oley Valley Architectural Antiques. Sullivan went on to lead the Chicago School of Architecture, and become the mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright. An -tall Modern Gothic exhibition cabinet now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is attributed to Pabst, and was once attributed also to Furness. It features cameo-carved doors in maple and walnut, painted glass panels backed with foil, a shingled-roof top, and ornate brass hardware.

Pabst's \\"largest existing work\\" is thought to be the John Bond Trevor mansion, \\"Glenview\\" (1876–77), in Yonkers, New York--part of the Hudson River Museum complex. An 1877 newspaper article credits the mansion's mantels to Pabst; and the interior woodwork, ebonized library, and grand staircase are attributed to him. Although there is no evidence of Furness's involvement, Pabst used design elements that can also be found in Furness commissions—the parlor's mantel features the dog-faced beasts that flank fireplaces in several Furness houses, the entrance hall features door frames and a chimneypiece with shingled roofs (a frequent Furness motif). The 1877 article specifically credits the dining room's \\"very elaborate buffet\\" to Pabst, although only its base survives. Its relief-carved fox-and-crane panels, copied from a plate in Charles Eastlake’s book Hints on Household Taste, are repeated on the sideboard at the Art Institute of Chicago, and on other attributed pieces. Pabst also worked with Furness's competitors. The firm of Collins & Autenrieth designed the Charles T. Parry House (1870–71) at 1921–27 Arch Street, Philadelphia,Charles T. Parry House, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. and its Renaissance Revival interior woodwork is attributed to Pabst.Charles T. Parry House, from Wikimedia Commons. The paneled vestibule, while still attributed to Pabst, may date from a later renovation by another firm, Wilson Brothers & Company. The house's second owner was the renowned surgeon and teacher, Dr. David Hayes Agnew – subject of the 1889 Thomas Eakins painting, The Agnew Clinic. Before it was demolished in 1968, the house was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey.Charles T. Parry House, from HABS. The paneled vestibule, mirrors and other interior woodwork were salvaged and donated to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Joseph M. Wilson (of Wilson Brothers) was hired by Col. Joseph D. Potts to remodel a circa-1850 suburban house at 3905 Spruce Street, Philadelphia. And remodel it Wilson did, designing numerous additions – including a 4-story tower – and unifying the exterior with polychromatic diamond-patterned brickwork. The Potts House (altered 1875–76)Potts Residence, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. seems to have been strongly influenced by Furness's work, and has over-the-top Neo-Grec interiors that may be by Pabst.Joseph D. Potts House, from Wikimedia Commons. The dog-faced beasts appear again, flanking a fireplace, only this time they have wings! The Potts House barely escaped demolition in the late 1960s, when the University of Pennsylvania razed several city blocks to expand. From 1970 to 2005, it housed the university's radio station, WXPN. Now called \\"Wayne Hall,\\" it houses the University of Pennsylvania Press.Joseph D. Potts House, from University of Pennsylvania. Several sets of glass-doored bookcases attributed to Pabst exist—including a Modern Gothic 10-bookcase set (with shingled roofs), matching mantel (with dog-faced beasts) and overmantel mirror, that may have been part of a Furness commission. Pabst is credited with the elaborate, two-story interior of medieval scholar Henry Charles Lea's private library (1881).Henry Charles Lea Library, from University of Pennsylvania. This was removed from Lea's house at 2000 Walnut Street, Philadelphia in 1925, and installed at the University of Pennsylvania. When it was re-installed at Van Pelt Library in 1962, the fireplace was moved from one of the long walls to a short wall. The \\"Baby Doe\\" Tabor bedroom suite – a massive, intricately carved bed and bureau that once belonged to Senator Horace Tabor of Colorado – is attributed to Pabst.Baby Doe Tabor bedroom suite, from The Magazine Antiques. Tabor was sworn in as a U.S. senator on January 27, 1883, but was only a temporary placeholder, serving 37 days in office until the Colorado legislature could fill the vacancy. Three days before resigning he married his paramour, Elizabeth \\"Baby Doe\\" McCourt, in Washington, D.C. The bedroom suite was reputedly purchased just before or during their honeymoon, and returned with them to Colorado. The bed's 8-foot-8-inch (2.64 m)-tall headboard is carved with owls and bats, creatures of the night; the 8-foot-11-inch (2.72 m)-tall bureau-and-mirror is carved with cockatoos and songbirds, creatures of the day. The suite was later owned by publisher William Randolph Hearst, and was part of the furnishings of \\"Hearst Castle\\" in San Simeon, California. The Tabors' rags-to-riches-to-rags saga became the basis for the 1932 film Silver Dollar and the 1956 opera The Ballad of Baby Doe. Following six years on the antiques market - including a stint on eBayDaniel Pabst \\"Baby Doe\\" Tabor Bedroom Set, from Rare Victorian. - the \\"Baby Doe\\" Tabor bedroom suite was acquired by History Colorado, and is now part of the permanent collection of its museum in Denver.\\"Tabor Bed and Dresser,\\" from History Colorado.  Business  Pabst formed a partnership with Franz Krausz (Krauss) about 1854. According to Philadelphia directories, Pabst was located at 222 South 4th Street, circa 1854–56; Pabst and Franz Krausz were listed as cabinetmakers at 90 Cherry Street, circa 1855–57; both were working at 600 Cherry Street and residing at 234 Stamper's Alley in Philadelphia, circa 1858; the shop moved to 120 Exchange Place, circa 1861; and the company was listed under the name \\"Pabst and Krauss,\\" circa 1866.McElroy's Philadelphia City Directory, Years 1856, 1857, 1858, 1861, 1866. According to Philadelphia land records, Daniel Pabst and Franz Krauss, both cabinetmakers of the City of Philadelphia, purchased the property at 269 South Fifth Street on February 16, 1865 for the sum of US$4,500 ($ today).Philadelphia Land Records – Recorded LRB Book 74 Page 491 A company profile from 1886: > Daniel Pabst, Designer and Manufacturer of Artistic Furniture, No. 269 South > Fifth Street—One of the leading and most successful designers and > manufacturers of artistic furniture in Philadelphia is Mr. Daniel Pabst, > whose office and manufactory are located at No. 269 South Fifth Street.

Late in life, Pabst made a list from memory of his customers. It included prominent Philadelphians such as John Christian Bullitt, Henry Disston, John M. Doyle, Horace Howard Furness, Charles Custis Harrison, Thomas J. McKean, C. B. Newbold, Charles T. Parry, George B. Preston, John Lowber Welsh, Wistar [Caspar Wister?], John Wyeth; New Yorker Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.; and the Pennsylvania Railroad. On his business card – undated (no earlier than 1865, from the address) – Pabst listed \\"Gothic church furniture a specialty.\\"Daniel Pabst Cabinet Maker business card, from Bryn Mawr College.

A year after his emigration to the United States, Pabst married Helena \\"Salina\\" Gross (1831-1912) in Philadelphia, on June 11, 1850. As a wedding gift, he made her an exquisite mahogany sewing box – its inscription, written in a mixture of German and English, concludes: \\"Remember me Salina Gross 1850.\\" Of the couple's seven children, only three lived to adulthood: Emma, Laura and William. William Pabst worked in his father's shop, and was listed as a partner in 1894. Pabst was active in Philadelphia's large German-American community, and sponsored other emigrants, \\"taking them into his household while they were studying and learning their way in the new country.\\" He was a member of the German Society of Pennsylvania, which published poems by him. He saw his heritage as integral to his success: \\"I brought all of Germany here with me, in my inward eye. The tall towers of Cologne, the wonders of Frankfurt-on-Main, the old grey castles perched in mid-air along the Rhine—they were all part of my work.\\" He retired in 1896 at age 70, but continued making furniture for friends and family members into his 80s. In June 1910, he was honored by the University of Pennsylvania for 50 years of carving large decorative spoons for senior-class \\"Honor Men Awards.\\"Honor Men Awards, from University of Pennsylvania. Several of the spoons survive, including one in the collection of the Pabst family. Pabst died in Philadelphia on July 15, 1910. He and his wife are buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, outside Philadelphia.Helena Pabst, from Find-A-Grave.  Legacy  Scholarship on Daniel Pabst rests on the foundational research begun in the early 1930s by Philadelphia Museum of Art curator of decorative arts Calvin Hathaway. Utilizing the Pabst customer list, provided by the cabinetmaker's daughter Emma Pabst Reisser, Hathaway tracked down furniture still owned by the customers' descendants. The Lea dining room suite and music cabinet, the Ingersoll cabinets, and several other pieces were loaned to PMA for a 1933 exhibition on Victorian art and decorative arts. Some pieces were later donated to the museum. The largest collection of Pabst furniture is at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In addition to the above museums, he is represented in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Brooklyn Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York, the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Delaware, and elsewhere. The Philadelphia Museum of Art hosted a study day on Pabst in October 2008, organized by Jennifer Zwilling, and is preparing a comprehensive exhibition of his work. (The exhibition was put on hold in 2010. The Philadelphia Museum of Art has the largest institutional holdings of Pabst's work). A great-grandson, Richard Pabst, is assembling a complete list of his known and attributed works.

It lies along the Arabian Sea between the dioceses of Cochin and Quilon, covering an area of 333 square kilometers. History The Diocese of Alleppey was erected by the 1952 Papal Bull \\"Ea Redemptoris Verba\\" of Pope Pius XII that divided the northern territory of the old Cochin Diocese at the Kuthiathodu Canal Line. The territory to the north of that line now belongs to the Cochin Diocese and the territory to the south to the Diocese of Alleppey. The executorial Decree of 8 September 1952 assigned to the Diocese of Alleppey and Cochin respectively a supplementary personal jurisdiction over certain parishes in the territory of the other. This Decree was approved by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith on 24 September 1952 and became effective on 11 October 1952. The boundaries are defined as: to the north, the Kuthiathodu Canal Line; to the south, a straight line from the curve of the Pampa River at Viyapuram to the Arabian Sea through Thottappally; to the east, a line along the middle of the Vembanadu Lake continued to the south of the Pallathuruthy Canal to Viyapuram; to the west, the Arabian Sea. The area assigned to the Diocese comprises roughly the area of the Jesuit Mission of St. Andre of Muteret. The Jesuit started mission work among the St Thomas Christian in this area about 1570. One of the most influential Jesuit missionaries who worked in this area was Fr. Giacomo Fenicio, an Italian who was Vicar of St Andrew’s Church at Arthunkal, from 1584 to 1602 and again from 1619 until his death in 1632. He was a pioneer in Indology. A century of intense mission work of the Jesuits increased the size of Christian community from Cochin to Purakkad and built several churches, notable among them being St. Andrew’s Arthukal (1581). St. Michael’s Kattor(1590), St. Thomas Thumpoly (1600) and St. George’s Manakodam (1640). A few other churches built during this period were destroyed by wars or by sea erosion. After the Schism of the Coonan Cross, the St. Thomas Christians of the Mission of St. Andre were reconciled to Rome by Msgr. Giuseppe Sebastiani during his second tour of Malabar in 1662. Even after the capture of Cochin by the Dutch, the Jesuits continued to look after the Christians of this area until the middle of the 18th century. The Mission was then taken over by the Carmelite Missionaries and remained under the Vicariate of Verapoly until the restoration of the old Cochin diocese in 1886. In 1570 Jesuit missionaries started to work in the area. Five churches were built: *Holy Cross Purakkad (1570) *St. Andrew's church Arthunkal (1581) *St. Michael's church Kattor (1590) *Holy Cross Kadakkarappally (1620) *St. George Manakodam (1640 - rebuilt). On 19 June 1952 the Diocese of Alleppey was created by a division of the Diocese of Cochin, a prominent group being the \\"Community of Five Hundreds\\" (Anjoottikkar).

The plant originated from West Africa. Still a traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known fruit has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare. Boscia senegalensis is a perennial woody plant species of the genus Boscia in the caper family, Capparaceae. This plant is classified as a dicot. Native to the Sahel region in Africa, this evergreen shrub can grow anywhere from in height under favourable conditions. The leaves of the plant are small and leathery, reaching . B. senegalensis produces fruits, clustered in small bunches, in the form of yellow spherical berries, up to in diameter. These fruits contain 1–4 seeds, which are a greenish hue when mature. Boscia senegalensis is recognized as a potential solution to hunger and a buffer against famine in the Sahel region due to the variety of useful products it yields. It produces products for consumption, household needs, and medicinal and agricultural uses. Common names include: aizen (Mauritania and Western Sahara), (Arabic), (Hausa), (Bambara), (Fulani), (Berber), (Zarma) and ' (Tamasheq). The fruits are also known as (Hausa), (Arabic), (Fulani) and (Tamasheq). History, geography and ethnography Boscia senegalensis is a wild species, native to the Sahel region in Africa. It has not yet been domesticated. It currently grows in: Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, and Togo. Ethnobotanical indigenous knowledge contributes to the importance of this plant to the Hausa peoples of Niger and Fulani herders in West Africa. During the famine of 1984–1985, it was reported that B. senegalensis was the most widely consumed famine food in both Sudan and Darfur, relied on by over 94% of people in northern Darfur. Growing conditions Boscia senegalensis grows in altitudes of , in temperatures between and with rainfall conditions of annually. It can be found growing in marginal soils: rocky, lateritic, clay stony hills, sand dunes, and sand-clay plains. These characteristics make it a highly resilient species, able to grow without expensive inputs even in the extremely hot and dry desert region of the Sahel. Herein lies its significance for poor farmers – in times of severe drought and famine, when many other crops have failed, B. senegalensis can still survive and provide useful products. Other farming issues Boscia senegalensis - Occurrence in fieldB. senegalensis can benefit farmers because it keeps soil from laying bare and thus prevents soil erosion and degradation. It also buffers against wind, stabilizes sand dunes, offers shade to surrounding plants and cycles nutrients. In Niger, the trees are often cut or burned down by farmers in the dry season, in order to make space on the field for staple crops as millet or sorghum. However, due to the strong surviving character of the tree, it reappears after the first rains and continues growing as a small bush. How consumed and uses Fruits are ready for human consumption at the beginning of the rainy season, when most crops are just being planted, and there is little other food available. Fruits can be consumed raw and cooked. Raw fruits initially contain a sweet pulp that then dries out to a sugary solid, difficult to separate from seed. Fruits are often cooked prior to consumption. Juice can also be extracted and boiled down into a butter-like consistency that can be mixed with millet and milk to make cakes. In Sudan, the fruit is fermented into a beer. The seeds of B. senegalensis are also important sources of nutrition, especially during times of famine. To gain access to the seeds, fruits are dried in the sun, pounded to remove the outer seed coat and soaked in water for several days, changing the water every day. The seed soaking process, also known as debittering, is essential to remove bitter and potentially toxic components. Seeds are usually cooked prior to consumption. Cooked seeds are texturally similar to a chickpea and can be used as a cereal substitute in stews, soups and porridges. Additionally, seeds can be re-dried and stored for later use or ground into a flour that can be used to make porridge. Roasted seeds can also serve as a substitute for coffee. Hanza bread, cookies and cooked hanza, Zinder, Republic of NigerModern uses of B. senegalensis seeds are being developed in Niger Republic. They include couscous, cakes, cookies, bread, hummus, canned and popped seeds. These products from natural, wild B. senegalensis were recognised with the innovation award at an international food fair in Niamey, Niger, 2012. Leaf extracts contain carbohydrate hydrolase enzymes that are useful for the production of cereal-based flour and for reducing the bulk of cereal porridges. Due to their proven biocidal activities, leaves are also added to granaries to protect cereals against pathogens. Leaves have many medicinal properties, notably anti-parasitic, fungicidal, anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Leaves, although not pleasant to taste, can be used as emergency forage for animals. Young roots can be ground and boiled down into a thick, sweet porridge. Wood can be used for home construction as well as for cooking fuel in times of dire need. Boscia senegalensis contains natural coagulants that can be used to clarify water sources. Components of the plant (bark, twigs, leaves, fruits) can be added to a bucket of murky water, and the natural coagulants will cause clay and other particulates to compact and sink the bottom, allowing clear water to be obtained from the top. Nutritional information Fruits are a significant source of carbohydrates, as they contain 66.8% carbohydrates. The seeds are sufficiently nutritious, although they do lack some essential nutrients, notably lysine and threonine. The seeds have significant levels of protein (25% of dry matter) and carbohydrates (60%). In these regards, seeds outperform local staple cereals such as sorghum and millet. Additionally, seeds are rich in zinc, iron, methionine, tryptophan, B-vitamins and linoleic acid (essential fatty acid). Seeds contain 3.6 times the World Health Organization (WHO) ideal level of tryptophan. Leaves have high antioxidant capacity (nearly 1.5 times that of spinach) and are high in calcium, potassium, manganese and iron. The bioavailability of these compounds, however, is not very well known. Economics Leaves, seeds and fruits of B. senegalensis are traded in many small markets in the Sahel region. Some opportunities to add value are: roasting seeds to be sold as a coffee bean substitute, fermenting fruit into beer, processing fruit and seeds into prepared food, or processing leaves into medicinal applications. It can help raise incomes of the poor by protecting their stored cereals from pests and by substituting for other purchases from the market. In Niger, an SMI specialising in non-wood forest products markets a variety of products derived from the seeds of hanza. Gender Issues Women in rural areas usually have the responsibility of gathering and preparing B. senegalensis for consumption. This process can create an extra work burden for women, however, their dominion over this process may result in increased access to this food source and thus contribute to improving their nutritional status. In Niger, the commercially processed hanza seeds are gathered and pre- processed by rural women, giving them a valuable source of income.  Bitterness  The very bitter taste of the hanza seeds comes from high doses of glucocapparin (MeGSL). In order to make them edible, the seeds must be debittered. This is usually done by different water soaking techniques, taking about a week. The glucocapparin leaches out into the water in a modified state, where it is turned into methylisothiocyanate (MeITC). This bitter water has pesticide and herbicide properties. The bitterness of the hanza seeds functions as a natural pesticide when the fruits hang on the tree. Very few predators show interest in consuming the fruits until they are fully ripe, at which state birds may be attracted to the sweet jelly mesocarp. Likewise, harvested bitter, dried hanza seeds are not known to be eaten by rodents or insects. Therefore, bitter hanza seeds can be safely stored for several years as long as they are protected from rain and humidity. They can then be debittered and consumed on demand. This can be very helpful in ensuring food security. Constraints to wider adoption A major constraint to the wider adoption of B. senegalensis is the recalcitrant nature of its seeds. Seeds of this type are not well suited for ex-situ conservation, as they rapidly lose viability, and embryos are killed when seeds are dried. This creates a barrier to widespread growth, as it is difficult to propagate large numbers of plants for large-scale genetic selection and breeding. Other drawbacks to consumption include the issue of toxicity and the associated need to use scarce water resources and additional labour to leach out toxins during the debittering process. Practical information One intervention with the potential to help poor farmers is the creation of cool temperature storage facilities – as B. senegalensis seeds can be stored for up to 2 months at . It is imperative to spread knowledge of the wide range of benefits that B. senegalensis provides, in order to encourage small farmers to plant it. New plantings would offer increased protection to the soil as well as provide food and other resources in times of famine. It is recommended that the techniques of grafting and generating hybrids (wide-crosses) with related species be explored, as both techniques have the potential to increase harvests and/or improve the fruits. Promising preliminary research is being conducted using in vitro tissue culture technologies to propagate B. senegalensis. Additionally, direct seedling trials are recommended and being advanced by the Eden Foundation.

In 2002, Brazil—a major cotton export competitor—expressed its growing concerns about United States cotton subsidies by initiating a WTO dispute settlement case (DS267) against certain features of the U.S. cotton program. On March 18, 2003, a Panel was established to adjudicate the dispute. Argentina, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, the European Communities, India, Pakistan, and Venezuela participated as third parties. Focusing on six specific claims relating to US payment programmes, Brazil argued that the US had failed to abide by its commitments in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). On September 8, 2004, a WTO dispute settlement (DS) panel ruled against the United States on several key issues in case. The United States is the second-largest producer and world’s largest exporter of cotton. In recent years, the United States has been exporting an increasing share of its annual production, due in large part to a decline in domestic mill use. On August 31, 2009, after a series of recourses by both United States and Brazil, WTO issued a decision on the dispute DS267.Decision of the arbitrator — Recourse to Arbitration by the United States under Article 22.6 of the DSU and Article 4.11 of the SCM Agreement Retrieved 2009-08-31.Decision of the arbitrator — Recourse to Arbitration by the United States under Article 22.6 of the DSU and Article 7.10 of the SCM Agreement Retrieved 2009-08-31 The implications of the ruling are that it shows that the US and European Union have used loopholes and creative accounting to continue dumping products on developing markets, hurting impoverished developing country farmers. The WTO dispute settlement panel also found that the USA misreported certain programmes as ‘non trade- distorting’, when in fact they were trade-distorting.Dumping: the Beginning of the End?: Implications of the Ruling in the Brazil/US Cotton Dispute Oxfam International, 2004 In October 2014, a mutually acceptable solution to the cotton dispute was reached just before Brazil was set to raise tariffs on hundreds of millions of dollars in American goods. This included cars, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. Under the terms of the agreement, the US granted a one-off payment of US$300 million to the Brazilian Cotton Institute. Implications for African countries The International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) estimates that subsidies reduce cotton prices by 10% and the World Bank estimates this number at 12.9%. This amounts to an annual revenue loss of $147 million to African countries. Oxfam estimates that the removal of U.S. cotton subsidies alone would increase prices 6-14% and thus increase the average household income in West Africa 2-9%-- enough to support food expenditure for 1 million people. According to the ICAC, even though the United States may be the leading exporter of cotton, the cost of production is significantly higher than that of other countries. The average cost of production of a pound of cotton is $0.80 per pound in comparison to $0.35 in the West African country of Benin. According to agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis, the removal of American subsidies would cause a permanent upward shift of the price of cotton. As a result, prices would fluctuate around a higher average price. Furthermore, farm prices are usually set prior to the marketing season each year, which means that farmers do not always feel the full volatility of the price fluctuations. However, cotton subsidies in industrialized countries is not the only reason for the falling cotton prices over the past 50 years. Technological advancement and competition from synthetic fibers (such as nylon). A study, commissioned by ICTSD and conducted by Mario Jales of Cornell University, suggests that cotton prices would have risen over a 1998-2007 base period if the US had cut subsidies that were deemed unlawful by a dispute panel at the WTO, following complaints by Brazil.How would a trade deal on cotton affect exporting and importing countries?, By Mario Jales Cornell University, April 2010. Farmers in poor countries could have gained from an average 6 percent increase in world cotton prices over the same base period, if the U.S. had accepted proposals made by African nations to slash the subsidies provided to producers in richer countries. Cotton production in the United States could have declined by as much as 15 percent, the study suggests, if African proposals in the draft Doha accord were applied to historical output levels over the ten- year period examined by the study, and production in the EU could drop by as much as 30 percent. However, production volumes could increase by as much as 3-3.5 percent in Brazil, Central Asia and West Africa - with production values growing by up to 13 percent. Similarly, if African proposals that are included in the Doha draft were applied to trade flows over the ten-year period that the study examines, U.S. export volumes would have fallen by 16 percent on average. Average export volumes would have increased dramatically for Brazil and India (12-14 percent), and by a lower but still substantial amount in Uzbekistan, the ‘C-4′ West African cotton producing countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali), and Australia (2-2.5 percent). Resulting Legislation Under the latest version of the U.S. farm bill, cotton will have the lowest subsidies of all U.S. field crops when it used to have the highest. The Senate and House versions of this bill will eliminate multiple aspects of U.S. cotton subsidies, including direct-payments to farmers counter-cyclical payments. The intention of both of these policies is to increase farmers' income when the price of cotton drops. However, U.S. cotton farmers will still be protected to an extent. The House and Senate bills include the Stacked Income Protection Program (STAX), which serves as a form of income protection for the farmers. STAX guarantees cotton farmers that they will receive between 70% and 90% of the expected revenue for their area which is determined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Federal subsidies cover 80% of the premiums for this insurance program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the estimated cost of this program is $3.29 billion. The farm bill contains no limit to the payout that any individual cotton farmer can receive under the STAX program. Brazil also agreed to not motion new WTO retaliatory sanctions against U.S. cotton programs while the current farm bill is in action or “against agricultural export guarantees.” Brazilian Cotton Industry Brazil is the fifth largest cotton producer in the world. According to the latest information from USDA, Brazil is the fifth largest cotton producing country and the third largest exporter in the world. Cotton prices have continued to decline - not due to changes in U.S. cotton policy (which is no longer considered a program crop under the 2014 Farm Bill) but rather due to Chinese cotton policy.

It is closely related to Stockholm syndrome and is a stress induced behavioral disorder . Whether it comes from a genuine desire to \\"repent\\", an appeal to authority, or other factors is a subject for debate. Political Contributions In 1993 the Congress of the United States passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act after a 1990 decision in Employment Division V. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 which gave the state the power to deny unemployment to individuals who violate the state law against peyote even if used in religious rituals. The law prohibited the government from interfering with the exercise of religion without just cause.\\"What is RFRA and why do we care\\", National Constitution Center, 2014 Soon after the passing of Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it was overturned after the decision in 1994 in the case of Boerne V. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 where it was decided that it was unconstitutional to apply the law to the states.\\"ACJL Memorandum: An overview of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\\", American Center for Law and Justice, 2011 Recently Congress passed a federal law recognizing a prisoner's religious rights; this law is known as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). This law allows inmates to practice a wide variety of religions without discrimination, as well as attend regular services and possess many religious items. RLUIPA states, \\"No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution\\" unless that burden \\"is in furtherance of government interest\\" or \\"is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government interest\\". Incarceration Accommodations Many jails and prisons have sought out to make sure the constitutional rights of inmates are properly protected. However, institutional safety and security need to be considered. The First Amendment states, \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...” The Correctional system often struggles to find a balance between these two contrasting ideals of freedom and safety. Cases dealing with accommodations for religious practices are frequently seen in the court system. Frequently debated topics include, but are not limited to, food choices, clothing and accessory choice, hair length and style, and possession of religious symbols.\\"Beliefs Behind Bars: The Government's Role in Prison Prayer\\", Michelle Fabio, December 2009 Laws regarding the rights and privileges of prisons varies by state, and sometimes by establishment. Jails that accept federal prisoners must look at policies, disclosed in the RLUIPA, to determine whether policies and practices are appropriate.\\"Jail Religion\\", Jack Ryan, J.D. In 1987, Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, was reviewed by the Supreme Court. The review of this case resulted in the \\"Turner\\" test, which allows restrictions to be placed on an inmate's First Amendment rights. There are four defined factors which outlines when an inmate's right can be violated. These conditions are known by every correctional employee and are used in every decision regarding religious items dealing with inmates.\\"Religion in Today's Jails: A Trilogy' , Carrie Hills 1\\\\.

Whether \\"there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates;\\" 3\\\\. “[T]he impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally\\" and 4\\\\. The existence of obvious, easy alternatives may show that the policy is an ”exaggerated response” to legitimate prison concerns. Joining Religions While Incarcerated In a study by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, the researchers concluded that religious prisoners found many benefits in their religion, including an easier time adjusting to prison, safety, and an increased ability to cope.\\"Does involvement in religion help prisoners adjust to prison?\\", The National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Nov 1992 Studies have shown that one of the reasons inmates become involved in religion is to improve their self-concept. Many inmates experience guilt, remorse, and pain as a result of their criminal history and background. Religion helps them to feel better about themselves and thus improve their self-concept in this way.\\"Religion in Corrections\\", The Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, 2002 There are various other reasons inmates may find religion while in prison. Some prisoners may seek to improve their life and the discipline required to practice religion helps them to change and control their actions. Others may join a religious group as a form of protection from other inmates. It is a rarity for a physical altercation to occur in a place of worship, this means prisoners have a high degree of respect for these places. Social interaction is also an important reason for some inmates to join a religious group. These interactions not only allow the benefit of socializing with other people, but also the benefit of exchanging goods and services among each other.\\"Religion in Corrections\\", The Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, 2002 According to the 2013 census, completed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the U.S. prison population continues to decline. The estimated number of inmates in the prison system was 1,574,700 people.\\"Prisoners in 2013\\", Bureau of Justice Statistics, September 2014 Of these people, less than 1% (.07%) of inmates identify as atheists.

Giambastiani's work is also usually imbued with a strong historical context, resulting in many of his novels being classified as alternate history, historical fantasy, or historical fiction. Biography Born in San Rafael, California, Giambastiani first embarked on a career in music. He studied classical music at San Francisco State University before transferring to the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance in Jerusalem, Israel. He moved to Seattle, Washington in 1984. Upon returning to the United States from Israel, he spent several years as a violist with regional orchestras, including five years as principal violist with the Bellevue Philharmonic in Washington State. At the same time, Giambastiani built a second career as a software developer. Giambastiani switched from music to writing in the early 1990s, concentrating on short stories in science fiction and fantasy. After several publications of his short fiction, he turned to novels and, in 2001, debuted with The Year the Cloud Fell, the first volume in his Fallen Cloud Saga, which was a finalist for the Endeavour Award.

Built in West Virginia Elder (YN-15) was launched 19 June 1941 by Marietta Manufacturing Company, Point Pleasant, West Virginia; and placed in service 12 November 1941, Lieutenant T. D. E. Martin, USNR, in charge. She was redesignated AN-20 on 20 January 1944. World War II service Serving in the 1st Naval District Elder laid and tended nets at Boston, Massachusetts, until 15 March 1942, then sailed to Portland, Maine, to serve as controlling gate vessel in Hussey Sound. She was commissioned 15 December 1942, Lieutenant D. H. Morse, USNR, in command. Elder returned to Boston 25 June 1943, and sailed 8 August, for San Diego, California, Pearl Harbor, and Funafuti, Ellice Islands, arriving 15 November. She assembled, launched, and tended nets there, and after the capture of the Gilbert Islands, sailed to Tarawa in December for mooring and net operations off that island, Makin, and Abemama. Departing the Gilberts in February 1944 with LCT-247 in tow for Kwajalein, she laid and cared for nets in the Marshall Islands until the end of the year. After an overhaul on the U.S. West Coast, Elder returned to the South Pacific Ocean to repair nets at the fleet base at Manus, arriving there 30 April 1945. The following month she got underway for Luzon, searching for and towing the disabled merchant tanker SS McKitterick Hills en route. She delivered the tanker to Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, then continued to Subic Bay for voyage repairs. Elder remained in the Philippines for the rest of the war. She laid sonar buoy moorings to protect against Japanese submarines entering Subic Bay; made a sounding survey of North Channel between Corregidor and Bataan; and in September began plotting the position of known wrecks in Manila Harbor. In October she returned to Subic Bay to remove and salvage net defense. End-of-war activity Elder sailed back to Corregidor in November 1945 for a unique assignment. Until May 1946 she conducted diving operations in Caballo Bay to recover thousands of silver pesos, Philippine currency, which had been dumped in the bay to prevent its capture by the Japanese. Remaining in the Philippines, Elder operated from her base at Subic Bay on a variety of assignments. She assisted in the decommissioning of small craft; maintained moorings; transported passengers and cargo between Philippine ports; and occasionally escorted small craft to Okinawa. Post-war activity Elder returned to the U.S. West Coast 3 August 1948 for duty at the Naval Net Depot at Tiburon, California. On 23 May 1949 she sailed for Alaskan waters where she conducted buoy operations at Adak; carried a scientific party from Great Sitkin Island to Adak; and transported three Navy petty officers to service the weather station of Simeonoff Island. She returned to her base at Tiburon 13 October 1949. Fire aboard the vessel at sea In 1950 Elder was ordered to the western Pacific Ocean, but on 11 March when a week out of Pearl Harbor, a serious fire broke out in the engine room. With all headway lost and no water pressure, Elder appeared doomed. But sound training and Navy \\"know-how,\\" combined with determined courage in the ship's intrepid damage control parties, subdued the raging flames. Her engines damaged beyond repair, the stricken net tender drifted helplessly for a week before assistance in the form of Comstock (LSD-19) and Piedmont (AD-17) arrived on 18 March. The next day Elder was taken in tow by Deliver (ARS-23) and began the long slow haul to Pearl Harbor.  Korean War support General Quarters Exercise Aboard the Elder, in 1953 or 1954 Her extensive repairs complete, Elder sailed from Pearl Harbor 26 January 1951 for net operations at Yokosuka, Japan, a key operating base in the Korean War. She returned to Tiburon 27 January 1952, and except for occasional cruises to Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Guam for net and buoy operations, served on the west coast. In April 1954 she was assigned to the 13th Naval District for training duty with the harbor defense unit of the Pacific Northwest. Final decommissioning She was decommissioned there 18 December 1959. Honors and awards Elder received one battle star for World War II service because of her participation in the Gilbert Islands operation.

Plot summary The Given Day is a historical novel set in Boston, Massachusetts and Tulsa, Oklahoma. The story has two main characters: Aiden \\"Danny\\" Coughlin, an ethnic Irish Boston Police patrolman, whose father is a prominent detective and captain in the department; and Luther Laurence, a talented black amateur baseball player from Columbus, Ohio. The novel starts at the end of the First World War, when union organizing activities are high across the country. The year is 1918 and the BPD patrolmen have not been given a raise since 1905; they are working for below-poverty level wages. The Boston Social Club (BSC) is the fraternal organization of the BPD patrolmen and its members begin to discuss their grievances and possible actions. Due to his family's high status and reputation in the police department, Danny is reluctant to attend BSC meetings. His partner, Steve Coyle, is able to get him to attend some meetings where the BSC hopes to join the American Federation of Labor, a national union. BPD Captain Thomas Coughlin (Danny's father), FBI agent Rayme Finch, and a Department of Justice lawyer, the young J. Edgar Hoover, assign Danny to infiltrate the Roxbury Lettish Workingman's Society in promise of his detective's stripes. Danny is told that they may be collaborating with other radical cells to plan a national revolt on May Day. As Danny is undercover attending meetings with the Letts, he begins to identify with some of the principles they preach. He soon is elected as the vice-president of the BSC. Luther Laurence and his pregnant wife, Lila, move from Columbus to Tulsa, Oklahoma to start a new life closer to some of her relatives in the Greenwood District. Laurence and his friend Jessie earn some extra money running numbers for a local bookie and gangster, Deacon Skinner Brocious. When Jessie gets caught skimming from Deacon, a deadly confrontation ensues. Laurence has to leave his wife in Tulsa and flees to Boston, where his uncle sets him up with the Giddreauxs, a black couple who lead the Boston chapter of the recently formed National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In Boston Luther gets work as a handyman and servant in the home of police Captain Thomas Coughlin. While working for the Coughlins, Laurence becomes close friends with Nora O'Shea, an Irish immigrant and servant. She was taken in by the Coughlins five years earlier, when the captain found her shivering in the streets on Christmas Eve. Nora and Danny had a love affair, which ended when he discovered a dark secret from her past. She has become engaged to his younger brother, a rising attorney. Luther is manipulated by Lieutenant Eddie McKenna, best friend to Captain Coughlin and godfather to Danny. Delving into Luther's past, McKenna has discovered that he is running from the deadly altercation in Tulsa. Laurence has been earning his board at the Giddreauxs' home by renovating an old building as the new NAACP headquarters in Boston. McKenna forces him to obtain NAACP membership information and to build a secret chamber in the new headquarters. When the Coughlins discover Nora's secret, she is banned from their household. Luther is banned after being caught spending time with her and giving her food. Danny's involvement in the BSC takes him away from his family as well; his father is particularly opposed to Danny's new \\"radical and Bolshevik-like\\" views. Nora, Danny and Luther form a close friendship. Nora is on her own just as she was five years ago, the men of the BPD are counting on Danny to lead them to a fair wage and working conditions, and Laurence is trying to escape McKenna's clutches and make it back to his wife and child. The story culminates in the historical Boston Police Strike, which is precipitated by the police commissioner's refusal to allow the nascent police union's right to affiliate with national labor organizations, or to exist. In the chaos of the strike, Luther saves Danny's life. By this time Danny had reunited with and married Nora. Luther reconciles the difficult situation he had run from in Tulsa, and succeeds in returning there to join his wife and recently born child in the Greenwood District. (This is before the area was destroyed in the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot.) Babe Ruth storyline The notable historic ball player Babe Ruth is featured as a recurring character in The Given Day, along with other historic figures. He appears in the prologue and various transitions within the novel. In the prologue, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs are traveling by train from Chicago to Boston during the 1918 World Series. The train breaks down in Ohio. Ruth happens upon a pick-up game among some African-American players, one of whom happens to be Luther Laurence. Ruth admires his skills, then is joined by other of the Cubs and Red Sox players, who want to take on the African Americans. Ruth's team ends up cheating and although he knows it is wrong, he sides with his teammates. He is ashamed of his action and reflects on it at different points when he re-appears in the book. Reception Critics were generally favorable, commenting that Lehane had written a big American novel. Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, \\"He has written a majestic, fiery epic that moves him far beyond the confines of the crime genre.\\" She concludes by writing: Colette Bancroft of the St. Petersburg Times wrote \\"That time and place give Lehane scope to tell a uniquely American story, one grounded in our history yet ringing with issues that concern us still, almost a century later: race, immigration, terrorism, economic instability, political corruption and the corrosive gap between the haves and have-nots.\\"Colette Bancroft, \\"Review: Dennis Lehane's novel 'The Given Day' makes the historical personal\\", St. Petersburg Times, at Tampa Bay.com, 21 September 2008, accessed 26 September 2011  References  Category:2008 American novels Category:Novels by Dennis Lehane Category:Novels set in Boston Category:Novels set in Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:Fiction set in 1918 Category:Fiction set in 1919 ","title":"The Given Day"},{"id":"18650334","text":"John Guy Wilson (1842–1892) was a Manchester, UK patent agent and the founder of Wilson Gunn, one of the oldest firms of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys in the UK.

Playing career=Club He played for local side Boyland F.C. and with a trial spell with Burnley before signing for Sunderland in 1959. His debut for the club came on 24 October 1959 against Plymouth Argyle in a 0–0 draw at Home Park. In total he made 314 league appearances, scoring five goals while at Sunderland. In the late sixties, alongside Jimmy Montgomery, Cecil Irwin, Len Ashurst, Charlie Hurley and Jim McNab, Harvey formed one of the most notable and most settled back fives in Sunderland's history. During the 1971–1972 season, Harvey sustained serious back and other injuries which forced his premature retirement at the age of 30. International Harvey was capped twice for Northern Ireland 'B', and played three matches, all against Wales, for the Under 23 side in 1962, 1963 and 1964. By then, he was already a full international. His first cap was awarded when he was just nineteen years old, in April 1961. Over the next ten years, he was to collect a total of 34 caps, scoring three goals. Harvey won his first international cap for Northern Ireland on 25 April 1961 against Italy in a 3–2 defeat. His international career spanned from 1961 until 1971 where he made 34 caps, scoring 3 goals. Coaching career Harvey stayed on at Sunderland after his playing retirement, joining the coaching staff, and appeared in his testimonial match against Newcastle United in April 1975. He then took a similar job at Carlisle United under manager Bobby Moncur. When Moncur left the club in February 1980, Harvey was appointed as caretaker manager, and despite it being widely known that the club's board wished to reappoint former manager Bob Stokoe, a strong run of form under Harvey saw the side climb from being just outside the relegation zone to a final finishing position of sixth place, earning him the manager's job on a permanent basis. However, Harvey was sacked just five games into the following season after a series of thumping defeats, and Stokoe appointed his successor within a matter of hours. When Moncur was appointed manager of Plymouth Argyle in 1981, he brought Martin Harvey with him as assistant manager. The following year, Harvey was assistant to Northern Ireland manager Billy Bingham at the World Cup finals. Then, when Moncur left Argyle in September 1983, Harvey found himself temporarily in charge. He did well, guiding the team to a 1–1 home draw with Arsenal in the League Cup, and, although Argyle lost both their League fixtures under him, he was considered a strong candidate for the permanent position. However, the board decided not to take the risk, and went instead for the experienced Johnny Hore. Harvey stayed on as assistant manager until, in October 1984, Hore was dismissed and he found himself in the driving seat again. This time, his stewardship was to last for some six weeks, during which Argyle won two and drew one of their six League fixtures, as well as winning their FA Cup first round tie against Barnet. At the beginning of December, Dave Smith was appointed Argyle manager. In 1985–1986, Martin Harvey left Argyle briefly to work with Billy Bingham in Saudi Arabia and, for the second time, as assistant manager at the World Cup finals. He returned to Home Park, however, and continued to work for the club as a coach until 1990. Harvey was appointed assistant manager of Raith Rovers in 1990 by new manager (and former Northern Ireland, Manchester United, Sunderland and Rangers fullback) Jimmy Nicholl. In their time in charge together at Stark's Park the club experienced unprecedented success, winning the old Scottish First Division (now referred to as the SPFL Championship) twice in 1992/93 and again in 1994/95, gaining promotion to the Scottish Premier Division. Raith also won a major trophy for the first time in their history, a League Cup Final win on penalties over Celtic at Ibrox on 27 November 1994. Nicholl and Harvey left Raith Rovers in February 1996 to take over at Millwall, a position they held until leaving the South London club in February 1997. Martin is believed to have then settled in Devon. Harvey passed away on Monday 25 November 2019, at the age of 78.http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/managers.asp?name=MartinHarvey References External links  * Category:1941 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Belfast Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland international footballers Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Carlisle United F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers Category:People educated at Ashfield Boys' High School Category:Association football wing halves Category:Football managers from Northern Ireland Category:Raith Rovers F.C. non-playing staff Category:Millwall F.C. non-playing staff Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. non- playing staff Category:Carlisle United F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Martin Harvey"},{"id":"18650411","text":"William Ian Lawther (20 October 1939 – 25 April 2010) was a Northern Irish footballer who played for Sunderland and five other clubs in the English Football League.

Although her lawsuit was not successful, it brought enough attention to the issue of wage equality in education to begin to equalize salaries. Lawsuit The “Gladys Noel Bates Teacher-Equalization Pay Suit” was the first civil rights suit filed in the history of the State of Mississippi. This landmark lawsuit was the forerunner for school desegregation cases of the 1950s. Background In 1948, salaries for black teachers in Mississippi was on the bottom rung of the nation’s teacher pay scale. Black teachers were paid one-half the salary of white teachers. In some school districts, the ratio was even lower. The difference in pay was based solely on skin color, even when black and white teachers had equal education, experience and Teacher certification. The Black teachers’ organization in Jackson, Mississippi was the Mississippi Association of Teachers in Colored Schools (MATCS). It later became known as the Mississippi Teachers Association (MTA). MATCS talked quietly with the NAACP leaders about the possibility of filing a lawsuit for equal pay for Black teachers. After many secret discussions, it was decided that the logical choice for a plaintiff would be Gladys Noel Bates because she was both a teacher and an active officer of the Jackson NAACP.Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH), Jackson, MississippiSmith Robertson Museum & Cultural Center (SRMCC), Jackson, Mississippi =Preparation= During the long months of preparation for the lawsuit, all of the parties involved were pledged to absolute silence for they realized a slip of the tongue could result in Mrs. Bates being fired before the suit was filed. The chief counsel for the NAACP at that time was a young attorney by the name of Thurgood Marshall. Attorney Marshall came and met with the small group of MATCS and NAACP representatives in Jackson. Attorney Marshall told the group, point blank, that until they secured $5,000, they were not in a position to seriously consider filing a lawsuit. This was quite a bit of money in the 1940s. It would be especially difficult for this group to raise that amount. =Fundraising= In addition to the money needed to file, no public school employee wanted to have in his possession any incriminating evidence which linked him to the suit. Mrs. Bates was often cautioned to keep papers in a safe place so that names of school and association personnel would not be placed in jeopardy. The teachers decided to raise money for the lawsuit by increasing their membership dues by one dollar. They called this new fund the welfare or benevolent fund. Teachers, when asked by their white superintendents why the increase in dues was necessary, gave the well rehearsed reply that this money was needed for flowers and memorials for illnesses and deaths of black teachers. This was yet another survival tactic used by the African-American teachers during those years. The other problem that MATCS and the NAACP faced was how to bank these so-called “welfare” funds. This also had to be done in full secrecy. MATCS opened an account under an assumed name at the Tri-State Bank in Memphis, Tennessee. All litigation expenses connected with the lawsuit were paid from this account. Additional monies were secured at MATCS meetings by passing a gunny sack around the room. All teachers at the meetings would put their clenched fists inside the sack whether they had money in their hands or not. This was to protect members in case an snitch was in their presence. The snitch would not be able to disclose who had or had not contributed money to the case. =Final preparations= The next effort was to secure a local attorney to fight the case. For a time this seemed a serious roadblock. The only hope was an elderly man in Meridian, Mississippi, Attorney James A. Burns. He was very frail and it was seriously doubted that his health would permit his undertaking this strenuous physical and emotional case. To Mrs. Bates’ great relief, he replied that he felt taking on this case was the right thing for him to do. He agreed to become the attorney for the Bates’ lawsuit. Attorney Burns climbed a bus every week to come to Jackson, Mississippi to file papers and research State and municipal records for little more than bus fare and meals. He was paid $1500 for four years of yeoman service to the cause of civil rights.  Filing and consequences  The lawsuit was filed on March 4, 1948. Mrs. Bates and her husband were fired from their teaching positions by the end of the 1948 school year. The Bates’ along with her parents and a few teachers who had expressed favorable opinions about the suit, were ostracized from society and fired from their teaching positions as well. Mr. and Mrs. Bates were not only fired but Blacklisted from all public school teaching positions in the state of Mississippi. Gunshots were fired through the windows of the Bates’ home and it was ultimately burned to the ground in 1949. ResultsLegal results= This lawsuit was in litigation for four years (1948–1951) and, finally, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case, not because it was unmerited, but, relying on the precedent set by the Cook vs Davis Supreme Court case, it had ruled that all administrative remedies had to be exhausted before the case could be heard by the Court. The plaintiff must first seek relief from the local school board; if not given, then relief should be sought from the county board of education. If no relief is given there, then redress should be sought from the State. The obvious flaw and futility of this gesture is that a plaintiff would never survive the first step before employment would be terminated, as was the case with Mrs. Bates and her husband. =Long-term results= Black teachers did win a moral victory, and, in reality, equalization of their salaries. After litigation was begun, month by month and year by year as the lawsuit was winding its way through the District and Appeals courts, Black teachers’ salaries were brought to parity with those of white teachers in the State of Mississippi. So, by 1951, equal salaries were a reality and the lawsuit became moot. Personal life Mrs. Bates was born to Andrew J. Noel, Sr. (1883–1960) and Hallie Sue Davis Noel (1893–1985). Both parents instilled the importance of duty to God, family and community in their five children. In addition, they emphasized the importance of higher education. Her father obtained his college education by selling his inheritance (land) and putting himself through college. Her mother was a graduate of the University of Chicago. Mrs. Bates was reared and educated in Jackson, Mississippi. Mrs. Bates attended Alcorn A&M; College in 1937-39. She received her B.A. from Tougaloo College (1939–1942) and a master's degree from West Virginia State University (1952). She further studied at the University of Colorado, Denver. In 1938, John M. Bates (1913–1995) and Gladys Winnie Noel were married. From this union two children were born, Kathryn Sue Bates (1939) and John Milton (“Bunky”) Bates, Jr. (1945–2005). Prior to their marriage, John Bates, Sr. attended schools in Fairmont, West Virginia and was graduated from West Virginia State College. He joined the coaching staff of Alcorn A&M; in Alcorn, Mississippi in 1937. In 1979, John earned his doctorate in education from the University of Colorado. While visiting relatives in Denver in 1960, John and Gladys applied to the Denver Public Schools for teaching positions and were hired. The Bates’ have received community recognition in the form of some of the most prestigious awards presented for community service. Dr. Bates was the only person to head both the North East Park Hill Civic Association and its successor organization, The Greater Park Hill Community, Inc. organization.;The Greater Park Hill newsletter, Denver Colorado The John M. and Gladys N.

Ely } Samuel P. Ely is a shipwreck in Two Harbors, Minnesota listed on the National Register of Historic Places. She was a schooner that sailed the Great Lakes carrying iron ore, coal, and other bulk freight. She was built in 1869 and was a fairly typical example of the 200-foot schooner built in the 1870s, though she was reinforced for the demands of carrying iron ore. Career Samuel P. Ely first served in the Winslow fleet, often traveling from Escanaba, Michigan, to Cleveland, Ohio, and occasionally to Marquette, Michigan. In 1881, it was purchased by the Bradley Transportation Company of Cleveland. As part of the Bradley fleet, it often served the ore docks at Duluth, Minnesota, Ashland, Wisconsin, and Two Harbors, Minnesota. Later in her career, she was often towed as a barge behind a steamboat, Sarah E. Sheldon or other Bradley steamers. Samuel P. Ely visited Two Harbors approximately 150 times between 1884 and 1896. The wreck In October 1896, Samuel P. Ely traveled from Kelley's Island, Ohio to Duluth, Minnesota, in tow of Hesper and carrying a load of limestone. Hesper was also towing Negaunee, a similar barge. Hesper, along with Samuel P. Ely and Negaunee, reached Duluth on 27 October 1896. The two barges unloaded their limestone while Hesper unloaded her cargo of coal. On 29 October 1896, Hesper steamed up to Two Harbors with Negaunee and Samuel P. Ely in tow. A storm had impeded their progress to Two Harbors, with heavy headwinds and high seas, and Hesper was barely able to make it into port while towing Samuel P. Ely. Around 8:00 in the evening, Hesper had to cast off the towline, and although the crew of Samuel P. Ely dropped the anchors, they were unable to hold the ship, and she drifted toward the breakwater. Around midnight, she was wedged against the rocks of the breakwater and could not be moved. Finally, around 3:00 in the morning, Samuel P. Ely sank, although the crew was able to escape drowning by clinging to the rigging of the masts. The next morning, many residents of Two Harbors were watching the scene from the shore, but any plan to rescue the crew was complicated by the possibility of the tugboat becoming entangled on the breakwater as well. Finally, someone devised a plan whereby the tugboat Ella G. Stone would travel close to the wreck and float a small sailboat out to the wreck while tethered on about of line. This plan was successful, although it took three trips to retrieve all ten men of the crew. Deterioration and preservation Two tie rods that help hold the hull together Samuel P. Ely suffered further damage after she sank. The ship's location became known to recreational scuba divers in the mid to late 1950s, and local historians and divers noted that several items were removed from the wreck between 1958 and 1961. Several small pieces of equipment were removed at first. In 1961, a large wooden anchor was removed and put on display in someone's lawn in Superior, Wisconsin. The deck capstan was removed in 1974 and brought to Lake Superior Maritime Collections in Duluth. One of the deck winches was removed in 1978 and brought to the SS Meteor Marine Museum in Superior, while another winch was removed to an unknown location. There were also reports that divers had removed parts of the red oak deck planking to make furniture and picture frames. After the wreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, it became illegal to remove artifacts from the wreck. High seas, repair work to the breakwater structure, and other forces have caused deterioration of the wreck. In 1994, a group of concerned divers began a project to preserve Samuel P. Ely, since the deck was starting to collapse into the hull. They performed a series of dives under the ice in March 1994 and lifted the deck through holes in the ice, then installed 3/4 inch steel tie rods to hold the sides of the hull together. After the sides of the hull were fastened into place, the deck was lowered back onto place onto the original ledges that supported it. The group also installed simple measuring devices to monitor the movement of the hull over time. This group later evolved into the Great Lakes Shipwreck Preservation Society. In 2001, members of the group returned to do some more strengthening work, including installing thicker steel rods with turnbuckles. ReferencesExternal links * YouTube video of a dive on Samuel P.

A player with the initiative will often seek to maneuver his pieces into more and more advantageous positions as he launches successive attacks. The player who lacks the initiative may seek to regain it through . Discussion Due to moving first, White starts the game with the initiative, but it can be lost in the opening by accepting a gambit. Players can also lose initiative by making unnecessary moves that allow the opponent to gain tempo, such as superfluous \\"preventive\\" moves intended to guard against certain actions by the opponent, that nonetheless require no specific response by them. The concept of tempo is closely tied to initiative, as players can acquire the initiative or buttress it by gaining a tempo. The initiative is important in all phases of the game, but more important in the endgame than in the middlegame and more important in the middlegame than in the opening . Having the initiative puts the opponent on the defensive. Grandmaster Larry Evans considers four elements of chess: pawn structure, force (), ' (controlling the and piece ), and time. Time is measured in tempos. Having a time advantage is having the initiative . The initiative should be kept as long as possible and only given up for another advantage .

Miriani (January 1, 1897 – October 18, 1987) was an American politician who served as mayor of Detroit, Michigan (1957–62). To date, he remains the most recent Republican to serve as Detroit's mayor. Biography Miriani graduated from the University of Detroit Law School. He was chief counsel and later director of the Detroit Legal Aid Bureau. He was elected to the Detroit City Council in 1947, and was council president from 1949–1957. He became Mayor in 1957 after the death of Albert Cobo, and was elected in his own right shortly afterward by a 6:1 margin over his opponent. Miriani was best known for completing many of the large-scale urban renewal projects initiated by the Cobo administration, and largely financed by federal money. Miriani also took strong measures to overcome the growing crime rate in Detroit.Alan DiGaetano, \\"Urban political regime formation: A study in contrast.\\" Journal of Urban Affairs 11.3 (1989) pp: 261-281. The United Automobile Workers (UAW), then at the height of its size and power, officially endorsed Miriani for reelection, stressing his conservative \\"law and order\\" position. However, many African-Americans disagreed with the UAW about Miriani and generally opposed him.David M.

Thomas, \\"The Trade Union Leadership Council: Black Workers Respond to the United Automobile Workers, 1957-1967.\\" New Politics 10.2 (2005): 124. He served until he was defeated for reelection in 1961 by Jerome Cavanagh, in an upset fueled largely by African-American support for Cavanagh. Under Miriani's administration, Detroit's Cobo Hall and other parts of the Civic Center were completed, and the city's infrastructure was expanded. He was again elected to the City Council in 1965. In 1969, Miriani was convicted of federal tax evasion of $261,000 and served 294 days in prison. He retired from politics after his conviction. Miriani died after a long illness on October 18, 1987 in Pontiac, Michigan.

Netezza was acquired by IBM on September 20, 2010\\"IBM to Acquire Netezza,\\" IBM Press Release, September 20, 2010 and reached out of support in June 2019. It was later reintroduced in June 2020 as part of the IBM CloudPak for Data offering. History Netezza was founded in 1999 by Foster Hinshaw. In 2000 Jit Saxena joined Hinshaw as co-founder. The company was incorporated in Delaware on December 30, 1999 as Intelligent Data Engines, Inc. and changed its name to Netezza Corporation in November 2000. Netezza announced the industry's first \\"data warehouse appliance\\" in 2003 to meet the industry's need to make use of the rapidly increasing ability to collect consumer data. In July 2007, Netezza Corporation had its initial public offering under the ticker “NZ” on NYSE Arca.SEC filing on EDGAR databaseTheRegister.co.uk article about the IPO Hinshaw coined the term \\"data warehouse appliance\\" to describe a product of shared nothing parallel nodes specifically targeted for high data volumes for modern data analytics.TDWI » Still Another Data Warehouse Appliance Is Coming!

The company introduced the fourth generation of the TwinFin product in August 2009. Netezza introduced a scaled-down version of this appliance under the Skimmer brand in January 2010.\\"Netezza launches Skimmer data appliance, teases two more,\\" January 25, 2010 In February 2010, Netezza announced that it had opened up its systems to support major programming models, including Hadoop, MapReduce, Java, C++, and Python models. Netezza's partners predicted to leverage this analytic application support are Tibco Spotfire, MicroStrategy, Pursway, DemandTec and QuantiSense.Netezza Opens up on Analytics The company also markets specialized appliances for retail, spatial, complex analytics and regulatory compliance needs. Netezza sells software-based products for migrating from Oracle Exadata and for implementing data virtualization and federation (data abstraction) schemes. The Netezza appliance was the foundation of IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA). In 2012 the products were re-branded as IBM PureData for Analytics. In 2017, IBM replaced Netezza with the Integrated Analytics System https://www.ibm.com/products/integrated-analytics-system using Power-8 processing frame and db2 as the database engine in an offering called db2 Warehouse. It featured both row-based and columnar storage plus high-speed flash drives. The db2 Warehouse engine runs both on the cloud or on-prem. In 2019, after acquiring Red Hat, IBM established Cloud Pak offerings based on OpenShift, and revived Netezza as Netezza Performance Server under Cloud Pak for Data, both of which could run on-prem or on the cloud. The offering is a 64-bit NPS with flash drives and optimized FPGAs. The revived NPS is 100 percent identical in feature compatibility to Netezza Mako, and moving to this platform required only an nzmigrate or nzbackup/restore. https://www.ibm.com/analytics/netezza In 2020, the first Netezza Performance Server in the cloud was GA on Amazon Web Services. This offering uses the actual AMPP Netezza Hardware, not commodity hardware running Netezza software. Migrating to this platform also requires only an nzmigrate or nzbackup/restore through an S3 bucket. It is a direct competitor to Amazon's Red Shift database.https://www.ibm.com/analytics/netezza Technology Netezza’s proprietary AMPP (Asymmetric Massively Parallel Processing) architecture is a two-tiered system designed to quickly handle very large queries from multiple users. The first tier is a high-performance Linux SMP host that compiles data query tasks received from business intelligence applications, and generates query execution plans. It then divides a query into a sequence of sub-tasks, or snippets that can be executed in parallel, and distributes the snippets to the second tier for execution. The second tier consists of one to hundreds of snippet processing blades, or S-Blades, where all the primary processing work of the appliance is executed. The S-Blades are intelligent processing nodes that make up the massively parallel processing (MPP) engine of the appliance. Each S-Blade is an independent server that contains multi-core Intel-based CPUs and Netezza’s proprietary multi-engine, high-throughput FPGAs. The S-Blade is composed of a standard blade-server combined with a special Netezza Database Accelerator card that snaps alongside the blade. Each S-Blade is, in turn, connected to multiple disk drives processing multiple data streams in parallel in TwinFin or Skimmer. AMPP employs industry-standard interfaces (SQL, ODBC, JDBC, OLE DB) and provides load times in excess of 2 TB/hour and backup/restore data rates of more than 4 TB/hour. In 2009, the company transitioned from PowerPC processors to Intel CPUs.\\"Netezza Is Changing its Hardware Architecture, Slashing Prices,\\" \\"Intelligent Enterprise,\\" July 31, 2009 In August, 2009, with the introduction of the 4th generation TwinFin product, Netezza moved from proprietary blades to IBM blades.\\"Netezza Pursues Broader Customer Base with Cheaper Data Storage Technology,\\" \\"Xconomy,\\" July 31, 2009 Recognition and criticism Netezza was added to Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for DBMS in January, 2009.\\"Gartner’s 2008 data warehouse database management system Magic Quadrant is out,\\" \\"DBMS2,\\" January 12, 2009 Netezza was mentioned in \\"The Spy Files\\", released by the controversial whistleblower organization WikiLeaks.

It is endemic to the Pacific slope of Mexico. It is also known as the rufous-backed robin. Description This species resembles its widespread relative the American robin in general appearance, but is a bit smaller at long, with an average wingspan of and weight of . It is named for the adult's rufous or olive-rufous upper back, which contrasts with the grayish head, nape, and rump. The chest and flanks are also rufous. The belly and undertail coverts are white; the throat is white with many black streaks. The bill and eye-ring are yellow. Females are typically somewhat duller-colored than males. Juveniles, like other juvenile Turdus thrushes, are spotted below; they are browner and have pale flecks above. The subspecies of the Islas Tres Marías, also found around San Blas, Nayarit, is sometimes considered a separate species, Grayson's robin or Grayson's thrush, Turdus graysoni (Ridgway, 1882). It looks \\"washed out\\", with little rufous tinting. The song is slow and warbling, with repetition of phrases. An example is \\"weedele loo loo freerlii...\\" The alarm call is a long, mellow, descending whistle, \\"cheeoo or teeeuu\\". Other calls resemble those of the American robin; the flight call is thinner. Range and habitat The rufous-backed robin inhabits dry deciduous forests, including the edges, and in human-planted habitats, at heights from the ground to high in trees. Its main range extends from southeastern Sonora to the southeastern corner of Oaxaca along the coast and in the Río Balsas drainage. The isolated populations in Mexico City and Oaxaca City are probably descended from escaped cage birds. A number of vagrants have reached the Mexican-border states of the United States, where they are often found in riparian woods. Behavior This species is shyer than the American robin. In winter it often forms flocks. The diet is typical of thrushes: fruit and invertebrates, especially insects. Reproduction resembles that of other Turdus species. The eggs are whitish with heavy red-brown markings.

The theater played both first-run independent films and repertory showings, including retrospectives of such filmmakers as Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa and others, as well as genre-based retrospectives. It had also been home to several local film festivals, including the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival. The theater has hosted visits from several well-known filmmakers and celebrities, such as Terry Gilliam, Michael Moore, Peter Fonda, Cyd Charisse, and many others. The building was demolished in September 2011 after 95 years of existence. History The theater, originally called the Oak, was built in 1916, but was renamed the Campus Theater in 1935 and remodeled by design firm Liebenberg & Kaplan, who also designed several other area theaters, including the nearby Varsity Theater, located on the other side of campus in Dinkytown. It was designed in Art Deco style, seated 312 people, in addition to a meeting area in the basement for film students. The Campus Theater closed in 1989, however it was reopened in 1995 under the name Oak Street Cinema under the direction of Bob Cowgill (now a professor at Augsburg College), Barry Hans and Randy Carpenter. The theater has been owned and operated by the Minnesota Film Art, an organization created when the theater, under Cowgill's leadership, merged with the U Film Society. Financial troubles and Closing When Bob Cowgill stepped down in 2004, the theater fell quickly into debt, in excess of $145,000 by the end of 2005. Cowgill's successor, Jamie Hook, was fired in September 2005 for mismanaging the budget and missing grant application deadlines. In the meantime, MFA board members Al Milgrom and Tim Grady personally loaned the organization over $75,000 to keep it afloat, guaranteed against the value of the property, which Grady estimated at approximately $600,000. By the beginning of 2006, the board of the Minnesota Film Arts publicly considered selling the theater, resulting in a protest by Cowgill and community members, under the auspices of the group Save The Oak, which they created for that cause. As of 2009, the theater was still struggling along amidst continuing financial troubles. Local papers reported that the theater was likely to be sold and demolished to make way for overpriced condominiums.

Ford, FAIA, (born December 20, 1952) is an American architect and author best known for his work on K-12 sustainable schools. A regular contributor to architectural journalism, Ford is author of Designing the Sustainable School and co-author of A Sense of Entry: Designing the Welcoming School. In 2008, Ford was a member of the national American Institute of Architects (AIA) Soloso (now Architect’s Knowledge Resource) Editorial Content Review Board and subject matter expert for the website’s design content. He has been published in such prominent journals as Architect Colorado and World Architecture News. The best known works to which Ford has applied his architectural expertise are the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (Donovan and Green) in Simi Valley, California; the Walt Disney World Swan resort hotel (Michael Graves with Alan Lapidus Architects) in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; and the Tycon Towers development (John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson) in Vienna, Virginia.  Biography = Personal life  Alan Ford was born on the Travis Air Force Base in California, where his father was stationed at the time. While growing up, Ford and his family were relocated to Alaska, Georgia and Florida. By age six Ford had discovered and sought to develop his own creative talent through music. He cycled through various instruments and ultimately began playing guitar at the age of fourteen, which he continued into his twenties. Inspired by the 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival in Byron, Georgia, Ford went on to form the band Nothing (later renamed Free Form). From 1970 to 1972, Alan performed as a professional musician with his band. He began as a rhythm guitarist, often providing backup vocals, but later assumed the role of lead guitarist with occasional spots as lead vocalist. In 1973, Ford parted from his band and moved to Boulder, Colorado in pursuit of a career in the recording industry. However, upon an unsuccessful attempt at securing a job with a Boulder-based recording studio, he began working at a dental supply company to save money for college. Ford earned a Bachelor of Environmental Design from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1978 and a Master of Architecture from the University of Colorado Denver in 1980. Alan Ford is now married with a wife and two kids. They live in an 1896-built Victorian home in Denver’s Park Hill neighborhood. In 2000, Ford and his wife (also an architect) designed their own remodel of the house, which consisted of an addition that received widespread media acclaim. The renovation also earned a 2003 Architect’s Choice Award, sponsored by the Rocky Mountain News, the American Institute of Architects’ Denver chapter and the city and county of Denver.  Career  Upon receiving his Master of Architecture in 1980, Ford landed a job with W.C. Muchow and Partners Architects in Denver, where he remained for three years. In 1984, Ford moved to New York City where he joined the office of John Burgee Architects and Philip Johnson. He later went on to do work for Alan Lapidus/Michael Graves in 1989, I. M. Pei & Partners in 1990 and Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates in 1991. Alan attributes the cultivation of his fervor forarchitecture – which materialized in the form of architectural journalism – to the inspiration he found in Philip Johnson's passion for the profession. In 1993, Ford co-founded Hutton Ford Architects P.C. with Paul Hutton, where he was a managing principal until 2007. On June 1, 2007, in a move to diversify his firm's range of services, Ford established Alan Ford Architects P.C.; however, both he and Hutton continue to collaborate on a number of joint ventures under the entity Hutton Ford Architects, LLC. Alan Ford continues to practice as a licensed Colorado architect and principal of Alan Ford Architects. He authored the book Designing the Sustainable School and co-authored A Sense of Entry: Designing the Welcoming School with former partner Paul Hutton. In addition to his interest in K-12 sustainable school design, Ford has a passion for masonry detailing, which is evidenced by his Park Hill residence and a significant number of past projects. Ford has served on the editorial board of the award-winning AIA magazine Architect Colorado, and as an honorarium professor and guest critic at the University of Colorado, School of Architecture. He is also the former subject matter expert/editor of design content for the national AIA Soloso website (now the Architect’s Knowledge Resource), where he regularly contributed content promoting sustainability, design innovations and the architectural profession.

Viola Brown Sanders (born February 21, 1921 - April 28, 2013) was an American naval officer who served as deputy director of Women in the Navy from 1958 to 1960, and in 1962 was appointed as the 6th director of Women in the Navy (Assistant Chief of Naval Personnel for Women).  Biography  Captain Viola B. Sanders, born 21 February 1921 in Sidon, Mississippi, is the daughter of John S. and Viola Brown Sanders. She graduated from Greenwood High School and went on to attend Sunflower Junior College (now Mississippi Delta Community College) in Moorhead, Mississippi, for two years. In 1941, she received a BS in education from Delta State Teachers College (now Delta State University) in Cleveland, Mississippi, and was later chosen as the college's first outstanding alumna. She then taught grades seven to twelve in Glen Allan, Mississippi. Sanders enlisted in the WAVES in March 1943. She attended Officer Candidate School at Smith College in Massachusetts, and completed communications training at nearby Mount Holyoke College. On October 19, 1943, she was assigned as communications officer at Naval Air Station in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she remained throughout the remainder of the war. She was transferred to Naval Station Great Lakes, where she worked in recruit training. When women's recruit training was transferred to Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, Maryland, in late 1951, Sanders was assigned to set up the facilities for the women's regiment. After completing the move, she became the regimental commander in Bainbridge, a position she held for a year. In 1953, Sanders was sent abroad to Naval Supply Depot, Yokosuka, Japan, where she served as a naval intelligence officer. She returned to the U.S. in 1955 as administrative officer for U.S. Antarctic Programs, and aided in the office of Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd in Washington, D.C. In 1958, she was asked to be deputy director for Winifred Quick Collins, the Director of Women in the Navy. She later worked with the Naval Reserve at Norfolk, Virginia, for a year.

It was their first work in the Star Trek universe. Plot 'Memory Prime' is the name of a planet home to artificial intelligences called 'Pathfinders'. These beings help Federation personnel, including Commander Montgomery Scott's old flame, Lt. Mira Romaine, sort the information coming from all over Federation territory. This is intended for the project, Memory Prime, an attempt to undo and avoid a repeat of the fate of the previous archive, Memory Alpha, which was profoundly damaged by malevolent incorporeal beings (in the episode, \\"The Lights of Zetar\\"). The planet is also the host to a current series of scientific award ceremonies. Unfortunately the visitors are being stalked by a killer and Spock is being accused of being part of a Vulcan terrorist cell, the Adepts of T'Pel. Production The book was written by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, a married writing couple who had worked together on a series of science and technology textbooks in Canada prior to Memory Prime. They had decided that they no longer wanted to write textbooks. After watching Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home in a cinema in New York they wondered if there were Star Trek novels, and they got in touch with Pocket Books. The duo submitted a series of story ideas, and the publishers selected Memory Prime. The entire correspondence between the authors and the publishers was conducted by post, with no in-person meetings. It was their first work in the Star Trek universe, and they would go on to write behind-the-scenes book, a collaboration with William Shatner and eventually write episodes for Star Trek: Enterprise.

It is located on the Bow Back Rivers and was constructed in 1933/34. It is the only lock in Britain with rising radial gates at both ends. British Waterways were hoping to restore it as part of the upgrade to Bow Back Rivers which took place for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but the gantries which enabled the gates to be raised were demolished to accommodate a wide bridge giving access to the main stadium. After the Games, most of the overbridge was removed. Funding for the restoration of the lock was in place by early 2016, and it is expected to be brought back into use in 2017. History The Bow Back Rivers are a network of channels, which although they form a link between the River Lea and the River Thames, were never officially a part of the Lee Navigation. They were used commercially for navigation, but no tolls could be collected and there was no incentive to the trustees or conservators of the Lea to spend any money on their maintenance. Most of the channels had at various times been associated with water mills, and also formed an essential part of the flood relief system of the River Lea, but by the 1920s, they posed a flood risk to the surrounding area as they became choked. At the time, there were high rates of unemployment in the West Ham area, and the government had recently introduced an unemployment relief scheme. West Ham Corporation, working with the Lee Conservancy Board, applied for and received grants to enable major improvements to be carried out to the Bow Back Rivers. The work was authorised by the granting of an Act of Parliament, the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act 1930. The work included dredging and reconfiguration of most of the channels, a new lock at Bow, rebuilding of Marshgate Lock on a new site further to the east, and the construction of a new lock at Carpenter's Road, at the northern end of the City Mills River. The whole project took around four years to complete, with work starting in 1931. Work on the lock itself, which was long and wide, began in 1933, and it was completed in 1934. It was built with rising radial gates at both ends. The use of rising radial gates was fairly common in continental Europe, but Carpenter's Road was the first use of them in Britain. The choice was dictated by the fact that the structure had to act both as a navigation lock and as a means of discharging flood water. It also had to be able to cope with variable water levels in both the City Mills River to the south, and the tidal Waterworks River to the north, where either one could be higher than the other. It was therefore built with two rising radial gates, one at each end. The lock was built with a gantry over each of the gates, which housed the counterbalance weights and the operating mechanism. There were also steps up to the gantry, so that it provided a footbridge from one side of the lock to the other. Each gate, which formed an arc, could be raised out of the water in order to allow a boat to pass underneath it. A house for the lock keeper was completed by February 1935, and the lock was officially named Ward's Lock, after a local councillor, but soon became Carpenter's Road Lock. The lock house was demolished in 1967. Three other locks were built on the British canal system with rising radial gates, but this was the only one with such gates at both ends. Use of the Bow Back Rivers declined, and the last use of the lock by commercial traffic was in the 1960s. By the mid 1970s, both Carpenter's Road Lock and the new Marshgate Lock, by then known as City Mills Lock, were impassible and virtually derelict. The lock controlled access to the northern section of the City Mill River, the southern approach being controlled by City Mills Lock. Two locks were needed as, when tidally controlled, there was insufficient headroom for barges passing beneath the Northern Outfall Sewer, which passes over the City Mill River. Restoration The gantries were demolished and the lock was blocked off with stop planks during the Olympic event As a result of the passing of the British Waterways Act 1968, Bow Back Rivers were classified as a remainder waterway, meaning that no investment was likely to be made in them. However, in 2002, British Waterways decided that full restoration of the channels should be a national priority, and the Mayor of London ensured that this was included in the London Plan. By 2006, the International Olympic Committee had awarded the 2012 Games to London, and the chosen site for the main venues included most of the Bow Back Rivers. Initial restoration of City Mills Lock was completed early that year, In July 2006, the Olympic Development Authority sanctioned the building of a new lock on the Prescott Channel, which was subsequently named Three Mills Lock. Its purpose was to control water levels in the Waterworks River, maintaining them at a level where navigation was possible throughout the day. Previously, it had been a muddy creek at low tide, and at high tide, there was inadequate headroom to pass beneath the Northern Outfall Sewer, which crossed on a low bridge. The lock and associated flood defence structure were completed in 2009. Once Three Mills Lock was operational, the Waterworks River was no longer tidal, and so waterlevels at Carpenter's Road Lock were more predictable. In 2010, British Waterways were hopeful that negotiations with High Speed 1 Ltd, who were operating the Channel Tunnel rail link, would result in £800,000 towards the cost of restoring Carpenter's Road Lock. This was part of a larger programme to ensure that the Stratford and Olympic areas were adequately drained. Little progress was made, and with the 2012 Olympic stadium sited about south of the lock, on an island site between the Old River Lea and the City Mill River which branches just to the south of the lock, it was cosmetically restored and a wide bridge was constructed above the lock from Stratford City to the stadium. In order to accommodate the bridge, the gantries and ramps were demolished. By early 2016, the wide bridge over the lock had been demolished, and replaced by much narrower structures, to allow the lock to be rebuilt. The Canal & River Trust, successors to British Waterways, approved a £1.75 million project to restore the lock in February 2016. Grants of £680,000 were received from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £100,000 from the London Legacy Development Corporation and £4,500 from the Inland Waterways Association. Restoration will see the gantries replaced, to accommodate the counterbalance weights, and two new radial rising gates installed. These will enable the new structure to operate as a lock, and also to distribute flood water to the various channels in the Bow Back Rivers when the need arises. Operation of the gates to achieve this will be automatic. Hyder Consulting are managing the project, with Kier Construction carrying out the construction work. The new radial gates and control gear have been designed by Kgal, and because there is limited headroom, they will be built as a series of modules, each weighing less than 0.5 tonnes, which will be assembled on site. During the Olympics, the underside of the bridge over the lock was covered in mirrors, and this feature has been retained on the new narrower structure. The job of manufacturing the gates, the new gantries and the controls was awarded to Mayflower Engineering of Sheffield. The gantries are being clad in weathering steel, which forms a rust-coloured protective layer over time, and this is designed to contrast with the bridge over the lock, which is clad in stainless steel.

Collegiate career Peyser won two national championships while playing with the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays. As a freshman, he played in all sixteen games and helped the Blue Jays win the 2005 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. In 2006, Peyser missed a significant part of the season due to a broken jaw suffered prior to the season. In his junior season he was awarded USILA third team All-American honors, and again helped his team win the national championship. Peyser was named to the 2007 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship All-tournament team for his efforts in the tournament. As a senior, Peyser and the Blue Jays were again in the national championship game; however, this time they were defeated by the Syracuse Orange. As collegiate lacrosse has developed more specialists, Peyser's abilities as both a face-off man and offensive and defensive midfielder contributed to the Blue Jays success during his collegiate career. Professional career Peyser began his professional career with the New Jersey Pride in 2008. The Pride drafted Peyser 5th overall in the first round of the 2008 MLL Collegiate Draft. Peyser joined the New Jersey Pride which already featured his two older brothers, Michael and Gregory. During Week 6 of the 2008 MLL season, the Peyser brothers (Michael, Gregory, and Stephen) became the first trio of brothers to play on the same Major League Lacrosse team together. Peyser has had an immediate impact on the league, and was named Rookie of the Week for Week 11 of the 2008 season. He also joined his brother Greg as a member of the indoor lacrosse 2009 New York Titans. During the season, he was named to the All-Star Game as an injury replacement.

It connects them with adult women trained to serve as volunteer coaches, who become role models and also advocates. History Girls For A Change grew out of an initiative launched in Santa Clara County, California in 2000, and was officially founded in 2002 in San Jose, after the founders received initial help and training from Women's Technology Cluster. In 2003 it received a grant from the Draper Richards Foundation, with which it expanded in 2004 to Oakland, Santa Cruz, and East Palo Alto and in 2006 to Phoenix, Arizona. In 2008 there was a national tour of Change Your World training sessions, an online GFC Action Network was launched, and the organization further spread to Richmond, Virginia. The founding board included Niko Everett (formerly Clifford), the founding CEO, and Whitney Smith, who succeeded her as CEO. In 2013 Smith stepped down and was succeeded by Angela Patton, the organization's program manager in Richmond, Virginia. Girls For A Change in Richmond, Virginia, was founded in 2007 by African American girls seeking to improve the image of black fathers, and focuses on empowering girls of color. Activity=Girl Action Teams In Silicon Valley, Phoenix, and Richmond, Girls For A Change offers free after-school programming for middle- and high-school girls. For a year, Action Teams consisting of 5-30 girls and two adult female coaches identify challenges in their communities and design and implement creative solutions to address them as a team following GFC's 7 Steps of Social Change. The year starts with a Girl Summit at which inspiring women speak and ends with a Completion Ceremony. One Action Team led four high schoolers in Silicon Valley to found Girls Helping Girls, a non-profit that seeks to improve girls' education in countries around the globe. Change Your World trainings Starting in 2008, GFC began offering day-long Change Your World conferences at venues including corporate seminars, youth-empowerment conventions, and schools. During the workshop, women and girls are taught the basics of social change and a history of powerful social change makers; girls are encouraged to identify inspirations and role models. Partnerships Girls For A change has partnered with companies and organizations including: U By Kotex, Kotex's brand aimed at young women that also seeks to empower women and girls to celebrate their bodies and talk openly about periods and vaginal care—Girls For A Change received $1 for every signer of the \\"Declaration of Real Talk\\" on the brand website, Miss Representation, a documentary film and associated non- profit that seeks to explore and offset disparaging images of girls and women and sexual stereotyping in general—Girls For A Change was one of the women-led organizations receiving a share of proceeds from screenings of the film; Sephora; Eileen Fisher—a grant in 2009; the Theta Nu Xi multicultural sorority.

Peter, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2). Indiana University Press (), pp. 379-381 (2002). A transitional section follows which contains a dialogue between violins and bass alternating between loud and soft dynamics and ending with a trill. The second theme group of the sonata-form structure contains two sections. The first is a ländler scored for two violins against bass while the second is a minuet for the tutti featuring trills on almost every beat. The expositional coda returns to the ländler style. The development focuses on the minuet-style with the phrase- lengths elongatated. Following the recapitulation, the movement coda returns to this minuet and regularizes its phrase-lengths before the final cadence. In the trio of the minuet, the first violin is syncopated an eighth-note ahead of the accompaniment. The finale starts off with a falling dotted fanfare motif similar to the one that starts the opening movement. The answering phrase and the movement's second theme have a contradanse character.

R. G. Osburn, Jr., in command. World War II service=Pacific Ocean operations The net tender spent the first year of her service at various Gulf and East Coast ports servicing harbor nets. She performed this duty at Key West, Florida; Newport, Rhode Island; and, Boston, Massachusetts. Holly commissioned at Boston 15 December 1942, Lt. J. M. C. Tighe in command. Holly sailed 24 December 1942 to tend nets in New York harbor and harbors on the island of Jamaica, en route to the Panama Canal Zone where she arrived 19 January 1943. There she continued servicing net defenses until departing in convoy for Bora Bora 19 February. In the months that followed she steamed between Pago Pago, Suva Harbor, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo, working on vital net facilities which helped keep American bases and staging areas secure. Holly's classification was changed to AN-19, 20 January 1944.  Under attack by aircraft In early 1944, the ship joined LST Flotilla 5 in preparation for the invasion of the Mariana Islands. Arriving Kwajalein 6 June 1944, the ship sailed 3 days later with an LST group for the invasion area. During the preinvasion bombardment and reconnaissance 17 June, the fleet came under heavy air attack. Holly's guns assisted in downing several enemy planes; and, when LCI-468 was damaged in the battle, moved swiftly to take her in tow. With the assault well underway, the net tender proceeded to Eniwetok 25 June, arriving 5 days later. End-of-war activity Holly resumed her net servicing duties in the South Pacific Ocean during the remainder of the war, returning to San Pedro, California, soon after the surrender of Japan 15 August 1945. After a short voyage to Pearl Harbor to help dismantle net defenses September–October she arrived Bremerton, Washington, 28 October 1945, Post-war decommissioning Holly was decommissioned at Astoria, Oregon, 7 June 1946. Holly remained in the Pacific Reserve Fleet until being stricken 1 September 1962, and transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Olympia, Washington, under U.S. Maritime Administration custody. Honors and awards Holly received one battle star for World War II service.

Founded by the Dominican Order of the Catholic Church in 1962, the university is one of the top-five institutions in the country. https://www.scimagoir.com/rankings.php?country=PER&sector;=Higher%20educ. Its headquarters are located at the campus of Santa Anita which houses the faculty of administrative sciences and human resources, the faculty of accounting, economic and financial sciences and the faculty of dentistry. The faculty of human medicine, faculty of engineering and architecture and the faculty of law is located in the district of La Molina. The faculty of communication sciences, tourism and psychology is located in the district of Surquillo. The school of obstetrics and nursing is located in the Jesus Maria district, and a dental clinic owned by the university is located in the district of San Luis. The USMP has 4 language centers in the city of Lima, located in the districts of Jesus Maria, Santa Anita, San Isidro and Pueblo Libre. It also has an art institute and a government institute located in the district of Miraflores. History=The Dominican foundation: Pro Deo The University of Saint Martin de Porres began as a subsidiary of the Istituto di Studi Superiori Pro Deo, an organization founded in 1946 in Rome by father Felix Andrew Morlion and monsignor Antonio de Angelis. In those years there was a great promotion of the values of the universal church and, following this trend in Peru, this Pro Deo Institute would be constituted in 1952 under the auspices of the Dominican Order as an institute of social philosophical studies, where journalism, education and philosophy courses were taken. The first classes took place in the Rosario Convent of Lima, specifically in the section corresponding to the old apostolic college, and in charge of it was father Vicente Sanchez Valer O.P. The objective was to educate the youth in the Christian social doctrine to reduce the advancement of marxism in the peruvian university panorama. A non- profit civil association was integrated, called the Peruvian Institute of Social Philosophical Studies. The mission of IPEFS was to found a Catholic- oriented university. The ministry of education would legally recognize the Institute of Social Philosophical Studies on April 26, 1960 through Ministerial Resolution No. 5733. The institute began its official operation on May 2, 1960 with 113 students: 73 men and 40 ladies in detail. During this stage education was totally free, for that reason teachers and administrative staff worked without remuneration as collaborators. On November 5, 1961, the president of the republic, Manuel Prado Ugarteche, visited the Rosario convent where a solemn mass was held in honor of the then Blessed Friar Martin de Porres. The president was accompanied by Pedro Beltrán Espantoso, president of the Council of Ministers; the auxiliary bishop of Lima, monsignor Mario Cornejo; the First Lady, Clorinda Málaga de Prado and two ladies of company. Father Vicente Sánchez Valer invited both authorities, as his companions, to enter the classrooms of the new institute. Sanchez Valer took the opportunity to expose the importance of founding a university that honors the name of a beatified. After that, Manuel Prado would commit to trying to help in any way he could. The session of the associate members of the IPEFS on February 2, 1962 would prove to be of vital importance. Here it would be agreed to ask the government for the elevation of its academic entity, the Institute of Philosophical and Social Studies (IEFS), as a private university according to the current university law. For this the partners session decided: the establishment of the statutory bases of the future university, the election of a rector, a charge that would fall on the director of the IEFS, father Vicente Sánchez Valer, and a higher council of studies was appointed. A special patronage presided over by Pedro Roselló Truel would also be important to achieve the objective. This board had to raise 1,500,000 soles for the constitution of the university, a task that was finally achieved. Expropriation of the university by a dictatorship The revolutionary government, established by a coup d'etat of Juan Velasco Alvarado, would expropriate the university of San Martin de Porres to the Order of Santo Domingo, by the decree law 17437 of January 18, 1969. Despite recognizing the dominicans as founding entity , the ownership and administration of the new university would be delivered to the university community. The participation of the religious would be reduced to only 3 representatives in the Assembly of the University Council, although the rector and vice chancellor at the time were still dominicans. Development and expansion Apart from any controversy about university policy, it was during the rector of José Antonio Chang Escobedo that the university of San Martin de Porres would achieve internal stability. Thanks to that, the university began a process that allowed it to improve its infrastructure and general equipment. In 2006 a whole campus was inaugurated in Chiclayo, with the objective of combating the educational centralism of Lima. The president of the republic, Alan García Pérez, attended the ceremony; the bishop of the diocese of Chiclayo, Jesús Molinel La Barca and the president of the Lambayeque region, Yehude Simon Munaro. Despite the loss of the religious founding, the current directors of the university of San Martin de Porres and the Dominican Order have good relations, celebrating each anniversary of foundation with a solemn mass in the church of Santo Domingo.

Oppenheimer wrote the book in Frankfurt am Main during 1907, as a fragment of the four-volume System of Sociology, an intended interpretative framework for the understanding of social evolution on which he laboured from the 1890s until the end of his life.Paul Gottfried, Introduction to the 1999 Transaction Publishers edition, p. i–xvi The work summarizes Oppenheimer's general theory on the origin, development and future transformation of the state. The State, which Oppenheimer's missionary zeal pervades, was widely read and passionately discussed in the early 20th century. It was well received by—and influential on—as diverse an audience as Zionist settlers in Palestine (halutzim), American and Slavic communitarians, West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, and anarcho-capitalists like Murray Rothbard. A classical liberal and socialist sympathiser, Oppenheimer regarded capitalism as \\"a system of exploitation and capital revenues as the gain of that exploitation\\", but placed the blame not on the genuinely free market, but on the intervention of the state. Oppenheimer's view of the state is profoundly opposed to the then dominant characterisation propounded by G. W. F. Hegel of the state as an admirable achievement of modern civilisation. Proponents of this view tend to accept the social contract view that the State came about as every larger groups of people agreed to subordinate their private interests for the common good. In contrast, Opphenheimer's view was an advancement of the \\"conquest theory\\" of the state that developed during the late 19th century by Ludwig Gumplowicz. According to conquest theory, the state came into being through war and conquest, a consequence of which was the establishment of social classes; the dominant conquerors and the subordinate conquered. This, in turn, led to the emergence of a political system to consolidate the power of the conquerors, to perpetuate and regulate class divisions. Oppenheimer's views led the American essayist, Albert Jay Nock, writing in the first half of the 20th century, to remark that in his own book, Our Enemy, the State:  Publication history  The State was first published in Germany in 1908. The 1922 English edition does not include the alterations Oppenheimer made to the 1929 German edition. In his introduction to the 1922 edition, Oppenheimer refers to authoritative editions of the work in English, French, Hungarian and Serbian, noting in addition the proliferation of pirated editions in Japanese, Hebrew, Russian and Yiddish.

The company was co-founded in 2002 by the late gynecologist, surgeon and venture capitalist K. M. Seng and Claude Wischik, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, who is currently the company's Executive Chairman. The company's protein aggregation inhibitors target the underlying pathology of dementia, with the aim of modifying or halting disease progression. Their lead compound, LMTX, targets aggregation of tau and is believed to act on synuclein, TDP-43 and huntingtin protein. Its primary development in Alzheimer's disease is focused in its activity as a Tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI).  History  In 1988, while at Cambridge University, Wischik and coworkers discovered that abnormal fibres of tau protein form inside nerve cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and that their aggregation into tau tangles correlates to the development of dementia. In 1997, Wischik and his team moved to the University of Aberdeen, where they continued their research into tau pathology and protein aggregation inhibition. In 2002, the company was formed as a spin-out of the University of Aberdeen. Methylthioninium chloride – a first generation tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI) was used in Phase 2 clinical trials in Alzheimer's. The Phase 2 compared 3 dosages of methylthioninium chloride). In 2012, Phase 3 clinical trials were starting with leucomethylthioninium salts (LMTX) for mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD).

One of these is undergoing a phase 3 clinical trial for safety and efficacy in mild AD as \\"TRx0237\\". The results of the trial were released in July 2016. As a whole, patients who participated in the trial did not show significant benefits from receiving the LMTX. TauRx has presented a post-hoc subgroup analysis suggesting that a small group of patients in the trial, who were taking only LMTX without any other Alzheimer's medication, did show significant improvement. However, this characterization of the secondary analysis results has been challenged on statistical grounds, and based on the fact that an inappropriate placebo group was used in the comparison.

History and profile Rose al-Yūsuf was first published on 26 October 1925. The magazine was named after its founder, Rose al Yusuf. It is published by the Rose al Yusuf group and is based in Cairo. The editor of the magazine was Mohamed El-Tabii until 1934. He had a great role in establishing the paper alongside its founder Rose al Yusuf, a Syrian- born female journalist. Other renowned Egyptian journalists worked later on as editors,including Mostafa Amin and Ali Amin. Armenian-Egyptian cartoonist Alexander Saroukhan drew the cover page of the magazine from March 1928 to 1934. Rakha and Zuhdi, Egyptian cartoonists, also contributed to the magazine. The magazine was started as a cultural and literary publication by Rose al Yusuf, but became a political magazine by 1928. In 1935, the publisher added a daily newspaper with the same name. Both are published in Arabic. Although Rose al-Yūsuf is a political magazine, it also covers entertainment news. In 1960 President Gamal Nasser nationalized the magazine, which began to be controlled by the Egyptian government. The magazine had a leftist leaning during the presidencies of Nasser and Anwar Sadat. In 1957 Ihsan Abdel Quddus was the editor-in-chief. Since the government took control in 1960, the editors-in-chief of the magazine have been appointed by the Shura Council. In July 2005 Abdallah Kamal was appointed editor-in-chief, replacing Mohamed Abdel Moneim.High-profile journalist Abdallah Kamal passed away on Friday at the age of 49 due to a heart attack.

He was a reporter specialized in Political Islam and Muslim Brotherhood issues. In April 2013 he argued that the Egyptian people would protest against the Muslim Brotherhood regime, which would be ousted from power in July 2013. After the Muslim Brotherhood was thrown out from power, he wrote a book about the Muslim Brotherhood International Organization. The book was based on a large amount of documents that explained what happened in fact at the Organization's closed rooms, and uncovered the secret relations between the radical organization and the intelligence services all over the world.

Business Development Companies Historically, in the United States, there had been a group of publicly traded private equity firms that were registered as business development companies (BDCs) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.Companies must elect to be treated as a \\"business development company\\" under the terms of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act of 1940: Section 54 -- Election to Be Regulated as Business Development Company ) Typically, BDCs are structured similar to real estate investment trusts (REITs) in that the BDC structure reduces or eliminates corporate income tax. In return, REITs are required to distribute 95% of their income, which may be taxable to its investors. As of the end of 2008, among the largest BDCs (by market value, excluding Apollo Investment Corp, discussed elsewhere) are: American Capital Strategies (), Ares Capital Corp. (), BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp, Gladstone Investment Corp () and Kohlberg Capital Corp (). Venture capital trusts A venture capital trust or VCT is a highly tax efficient UK closed-end collective investment scheme designed to provide capital finance for small expanding companies and capital gains for investors. VCTs are companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, which invest in other companies which are not themselves listed. First introduced by the Conservative government in the Finance Act, 1995 they have proved to be much less risky than originally anticipated. The last created VCTs to encourage investment into new UK businesses. History Although there had previously been certain instances of publicly traded private equity vehicles, the convergence of private equity and the public equity markets attracted significantly greater attention when several of the largest private equity firms pursued various options through the public markets. Taking private equity firms and private equity funds public appeared an unusual move since private equity funds often buy public companies listed on exchange and then take them private. Private equity firms are rarely subject to the quarterly reporting requirements of the public markets and tout this independence to prospective sellers as a key advantage of going private. Blackstone Group IPO Schwarzman's Blackstone Group completed the first major IPO of a private equity firm in June 2007.Photographed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2008. On March 22, 2007, the Blackstone Group filed with the SECThe Blackstone Group L.P., FORM S-1, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, March 22, 2007 to raise $4 billion in an initial public offering. On June 21, Blackstone swapped a 12.3% stake in its ownership for $4.13 billion in the largest U.S. IPO since 2002. Traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BX, Blackstone priced at $31 per share on June 22, 2007.SORKIN, ANDREW ROSS and DE LA MERCED, MICHAEL J. \\"News Analysis Behind the Veil at Blackstone?

KKR Private Equity In May 2006, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a new permanent investment vehicle (KKR Private Equity Investors or KPE) listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam (ENXTAM: KPE). KKR raised more than three times what it had expected at the outset as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. Because private equity had been booming in the preceding years, the proposition of investing in a KKR fund appeared attractive to certain investors.Timmons, Heather. \\"Opening Private Equity's Door, at Least a Crack, to Public Investors.\\" New York Times, May 4, 2006. However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.Timmons, Heather. \\"Private Equity Goes Public for $5 Billion. Its Investors Ask, ‘What’s Next?’.\\" New York Times, November 10, 2006. Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO. KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.Anderson, Jenny. \\"Where Private Equity Goes, Hedge Funds May Follow.\\" New York Times, June 23, 2006.

L.P., FORM S-1, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, July 3, 2007 in July 2007 to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company.JENNY ANDERSON and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED. \\"Kohlberg Kravis Plans to Go Public.\\" New York Times, July 4, 2007. KKR had previously listed its KKR Private Equity Investors (KPE) private equity fund vehicle in 2006. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market would dampen the prospects of obtaining a valuation that would be attractive to KKR and the flotation was repeatedly postponed. Response to private equity IPOs The initial public offering completed by Blackstone intensified the level of attention directed toward the private equity industry overall as media commentators focused on the large payout received by the firm's CEO Steve Schwarzman.Sender, Henny and Langley, Monica. \\"Buyout Mogul: How Blackstone's Chief Became $7 Billion Man – Schwarzman Says He's Worth Every Penny; $400 for Stone Crabs.\\" The Wall Street Journal, June 13, 2007. Schwarzman received a severe backlash from both critics of the private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity. An ill-timed birthday event around the time of the IPO led various commentators to draw comparisons to the excesses of notorious executives including Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco International). David Bonderman, a co-founder of the private equity firm TPG Capital, remarked, \\"We have all wanted to be private – at least until now. When Steve Schwarzman's biography with all the dollar signs is posted on the web site none of us will like the furor that results – and that's even if you like Rod Stewart.\\" Meanwhile, other private equity investors would also seek to realize a portion of the value locked into their firms. In September 2007, the Carlyle Group sold a 7.5% interest in its management company to Mubadala Development Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for $1.35 billion, which valued Carlyle at approximately $20 billion.Sorkin, Andrew Ross. \\"Carlyle to Sell Stake to a Mideast Government.\\" New York Times, September 21, 2007. Similarly, in January 2008, Silver Lake Partners sold a 9.9% stake in its management company to CalPERS for $275 million.Sorkin, Andrew Ross. \\"California Pension Fund Expected to Take Big Stake in Silver Lake, at $275 Million.\\" New York Times, January 9, 2008 Additionally, Apollo Management completed a private placement of shares in its management company in July 2007.

History and profile Al Dustour was first published in December 1995 and is published weekly in Arabic. The paper was originally published with a registration in Cyprus in order to get around the restrictive newspaper publication laws in Egypt during the Mubarak era. It was financed by Essam Fahmy Ismail, who chose its original editor in chief, Ibrahim Eissa. In 2010, Essam Fahmy agreed to sell the newspaper to Reda Edouard, a businessman with alleged connections to the ruling regime, who remains at the head of the newspaper's board today. Edouard replaced Eissa with Esam Nabawy. It started as a weekly newspaper published on Wednesdays. It later came to be issued both daily and weekly. Al- Dostour's popularity grew quickly after its founding. It became known for its colloquial style and wide use of cartoons. The paper published articles on current affairs written by various leading figures of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al-Dustour and the Egyptian government Since the day of its first issue, Al-Dustour has been harshly critical of the government, formerly that of the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, his family, and the former ruling party, The National Democratic Party (NDP). It was one of Egypt's top critics of Mubarak's 30-year rule. It introduced unprecedented cartoons of Mubarak and showed sharp opposition to his son Gamal Mubarak's likely succession to power. In 1998, Al-Dustour published a statement attributed to the al-Gama'a al- Islamiyya militant group in 1998, that threatened the lives of three Christian businessmen. The Egyptian Ministry of Information closed down the paper. It considered the statement unacceptable and a potential cause of sectarian strife. Seven years later, on March 23, 2005, the paper was revived, initially being published every Wednesday, and since 31 March 2007 it has been issued both daily and weekly. In 2007, Al-Dustour's former editor-in-chief, Ibrahim Eissa, was arrested, then freed on bail on 13 September 2007 pending an appellate court decision in a sentence of a year-long prison term and a fine of 20,000 Egyptian Pound (≈ US$3,800 at the time). He and three other independent Egyptian newspaper editors, Wael El Abrashy of Sawt Al-Umma, Adel Hammouda of Al-Fajr, and Al-Karama's former editor Abdel Halim Kandil, were charged with \\"insulting the Egyptian president and publishing false information likely to disturb public order.\\" In 2008, in a separate case, Eissa was again arrested and sentenced to six months, later reduced to two months in prison, on 26 March 2008, by the Boulak Abo El Ela Court of Misdemeanor for publishing \\"false information concerning Mubarak's health harming public security and the country's economy\\" due to articles and headlines in Al-Dustour speculating on the health of the 80-year-old president. Governmental authorities alleged that Eissa's articles caused a withdrawal of foreign investment in the Egyptian economy equivalent to US$350 million. Eissa was freed, a second time, on bail of 200 EP (≈ US$37 at the time) to hold off on implementation of the verdict until another appeal. On 6 October 2008, Mubarak announced that he would pardon Eissa, the first time that such a pardon had been issued in the history of the modern Egyptian press. Al-Dustour praised the pardon in its pages and asked the president to honor his promise to cancel custodial sentences in cases of publication. The paper has continued its opposition role under new President Mohamed Morsi. In September 2012, its former editor-in-chief, Islam Afify, was charged by a Cairo court with \\"defaming the president\\" and \\"harming the public interest with inflammatory articles'\\" Rizk, M. (22 October 2012). Al-Dostour Editor-in- Chief Islam Afify resigns after 'editorial pressure Egypt Independent and his travel privileges were revoked. Al-Dustour frequently criticized the Muslim Brotherhood, accusing it of intentions to make Egypt an Islamic state. Afify was jailed temporarily but later released due to the new president's decision to end pretrial detention for journalists. At the time of Mubarak's departure (February 2011), Al-Dostour was the fifth largest daily newspaper in Egypt, with a daily edition selling 45,000 and weekly edition selling 85,000 copies. On 28 March 2014 the 22-year-old photograph and journalist of the newspaper Mayada Ashraf was killed among three others, in the clashes between the demonstrators and the security forces in the suburb of Ain Shams.Egypt: Journalist killed in Cairo clashes CNN. 28 March 2014.

The first winners were Eastleigh. Blackpool won the competition in July 2010, as a prelude to their debut season in the Premier League. Rules In the group stage matches, each half lasts 40 minutes, before reverting to the standard 45 minutes for the knockout stages. The tournament features an unconventional points system through the group stages, which the tournament organisers state is \\"designed to encourage attacking football\\". *Each winning side gets the standard three points for a win. *Losing teams receive one point if they lose without scoring, and two if they lose but score. *There are no draws; if teams are all square at full-time the game goes straight to a penalty shootout to determine the winner. 2010 Tournament This year's tournament was sponsored by Spanish sportswear company Joma, who took over from Errea as the competition sponsor.

The single was released only on cassette tape and was sold exclusively in Target stores during the 1992 Christmas season. The single was available free with any purchase of Grant's 1992 Home for Christmas album. The song is similar in style and sound to the other original compositions on Home for Christmas and is considered by some to be a \\"thirteenth track\\" of sorts for that album. The album artwork for the single appears to be from the same photo session as that for the Christmas album. Though the song was released as a single, A&M; Records did not turn much attention to promoting the song, as it was a Target exclusive. Target promoted the song instead. This song was written by Robert E. Irving & Kevin Quinn. Grant worked as a spokesperson for Target on various promotional campaigns and charity projects during the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. She frequently contributes to the Target House charity. Grant's involvement with Target met some controversy when some in her Christian music fan base disapproved of Target's association with Planned Parenthood. Grant had previously recorded a song titled \\"Love Makes You Real\\" for a 1989 Target Christmas television commercial.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLRhzXFyRoQ However, that song was never made available for retail, in Target stores or elsewhere. Grant would later release Target-exclusive singles to promote her 1997 album, Behind the Eyes. Likewise, she released a Target-exclusive edition of her 1999 holiday album, A Christmas to Remember, which included a bonus track: Grant's cover of \\"Merry Christmas, Darling\\". \\"Let the Season Take Wing\\" has never been released on the CD format. When the single was released, Grant owned a great deal of her own songs (a rarity in the modern music industry) but was simultaneously represented by two record labels (another rarity in the industry). A&M; Records distributed her music to mainstream pop radio and retailers, while Word Records distributed her music to Christian radio and retailers. In 2007, Grant left both labels and took all of the music that she owns herself, as well as most of the music still owned by either A&M; or Word, to EMI Records. EMI took the opportunity presented by their new record deal with Amy Grant to issue new, digitally remastered editions of the artist's albums and new compilations of her hit songs. It is not clear whether EMI now owns \\"Let the Season Take Wing\\" or whether the song remains the property of either A&M; Records or Amy Grant herself. In September 2008, EMI released a new Amy Grant holiday compilation entitled The Christmas Collection. EMI issued a preliminary track listing for that release in July 2008 but noted that it was not final, leading to speculation and a fan campaign directed at \\"Let the Season Take Wing\\" appearing in remastered form on the compilation.http://www.chordant.com/products/new_releases_detail.aspx?bid=25144&bname;=September+30%2c+2008+Street+Date The final album released by EMI, however, did not contain the song.

The daughter of a playwright, Frische is best known for her screenplays, especially the war drama Støt står den danske sømand (English: The Viking Watch of the Danish Seaman) which received the 1949 Bodil Award for Best Danish Film. During a short career of less than 24 years, Frische wrote 22 produced screenplays including five of the popular Far til Fire (English: Father of Four) family comedies and two adaptations of Morten Korch novels. Early life Frische was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, the daughter of the actor and playwright Axel Frische and Christine Jørgine Christensen. In accordance with her father's wishes, Frische began her career by studying English and History at Bedford, England rather than attending theater school. While studying in England, she met a young Burmese student, whom she married, and moved to Mandalay and Rangoon. Before the outbreak of World War II, she divorced her husband, became ill, and returned home to Denmark. Career Shortly after her return in 1938, Frische made her stage debut at Det Ny Teater as Fedosia in Opstandelse under the direction of her father. Her theater talents were evident and she was engaged in roles at the Betty Nansen and Rialto Theaters in Copenhagen. She completed an education as a dramatist and film director at ASA and Nordisk Film companies, where she was a director's assistant to Benjamin Christensen and Emanuel Gregers, and in May 1943 she arrived at the newly established Saga Studio as a writer and film director. Frische wrote novellas and radio plays and the book Vejen til Mandaley (The Road to Mandalay), however her dramatic talent was seen best through her screenplays. Beginning in May 1945, Frische became a freelance screenwriter, working mostly for ASA Film for whom she wrote five of the Far til fire (Father of Four) family comedies. She also adapted two Morten Korch novels for the screen: Fløjtespilleren and Flintesønnerne. In 1948, Frische wrote the true war drama The Viking Watch of the Danish Seaman (Støt står den danske sømand) which she based upon the wartime diary of Kaj Frische. The film received critical acclaim and won the 1949 Bodil Award for Best Danish Film. In the 1940s, Frische also directed several of her own stories including Kriminalassistant Bloch (Detective Bloch), En ny dag gryr (A New Day Dawns) and Så mødes vi hos Tove (We Meet at Tove's). She also performed on screen as well as in Cabaret theater shows. In the 1940s, Frische also popularized the comedy character of Snøvle-Sofie which she performed for a weekly radio program. The character was often transferred to Frische's films as a whining, but tough gossip, such as the surly housemaid she played in We Meet at Tove's. In 1959, Frische was scheduled to perform in the film Eventyr på Mallorca (Adventure on Mallorca), but shortly after her arrival in Palma Frische became ill and needed to return home. After a long illness, she wrote a film about her life in the hospital. Frische died at the age of 51. In a career which spanned less than 24 years, Frische produced 22 screenplays, performed in 10 movies, and directed 4 films.

Called \\"a work of genius\\" by The New Statesman, it was the author's second novel and the first in which she introduced the characteristic style of clipped, precise dialogue that was to make her name. It is largely a character study, dealing with themes of tyranny, female subservience and unconventional sexuality within the setting of a boys’ preparatory school. Plot The greater part of the book consists of a character study of the staff of a boys’ preparatory school and their small circle of friends – the ‘masters’ and the ‘pastors’ of the title. The school is owned and nominally headed by the 70-year-old self-absorbed Nicholas Herrick who has established it in an old university town to be near the college where he spent his youth, although he spends only about 10 minutes a day on school business. Living with Herrick is his unmarried half-sister Emily Herrick, 20 years his junior, who puts on a front of sarcastically extolling him in public while privately despising him. The Herricks are friendly with the Fletcher family comprising the elderly Reverend Peter Fletcher, his wife Teresa, his unmarried sister Lydia, and his nephew Francis. The day-to-day running of the school is left to the senior master, Mr Merry, a man with no academic or personal qualifications for the role other than his ability to present the school in a wholly false favourable light to the parents of potential scholars. His wife Mrs Merry (known as ‘Mother’) helps out. The teaching staff comprise Miss Basden, an unmarried middle-aged schoolmistress, and Mr Burgess, a young and inexperienced graduate. William Masson and Richard Bumpus are unmarried fellows of the college who have been close friends for 30 years and who \\"meant romance for each other in youth\\". Many years earlier Bumpus had written a short novel but, considering it not good enough for publication, had had his sole copy of the manuscript buried in the grave of a friend. Herrick regrets that he has never got round to writing a novel, which in his eyes would make him a \\"real author”, though in truth it is his lack of talent. While clearing out the room of Crabbe, an elderly don who has recently died, Herrick comes across the typescript of a short novel. Believing that nobody knows about Crabbe’s writing, he steals it and claims that he has had a sudden inspiration for his long-overdue book. At about the same time Bumpus announces his intention to publish a new novel of his own, a complete rewriting of the book he had authored as a young man, though he says that in his case the death of Crabbe has caused his work to be put back. He does not tell anybody that the reason for the delay is that his typescript, which he had left in Crabbe’s room shortly before his death, has disappeared. Herrick and Bumpus both announce that they intend to give readings of their respective new works. Before Bumpus can start, Masson surprises him by saying that he had actually kept, and read, Bumpus's youthful foray into fiction and that he is looking forward to comparing the two versions. When the two authors discover that their first sentences are identical it becomes clear that neither of them has written anything recently and that the only novel which ever existed is Bumpus's early work. In the final chapter of the novel the Herricks, the Fletchers and the school staff arrange a dinner party to present a false but impressive facade to the autocratic Reverend Henry Bentley, an important parent with two boys at the school.

Critical reception The New Statesman said \\"As for Pastors and Masters, it is astonishing, alarming. It is like nothing else in the world. It is a work of genius. How to describe it – since there is nothing of which to take hold? ... No quotation could do this book justice\\". Themes and style Although the book is now normally known as a novel, the first edition was entitled Pastors and Masters: A Study. It was described on the cover as \\"like nothing but itself\\" and as \\"a little book which is a study rather than a story, but which has a story in it\\". It was in this novel that Compton-Burnett first introduced the characteristic style of clipped, precise dialogue that was to make her name. The book marked the start of what became a remarkable series of fierce but decorous novels dealing with tyranny and power struggles in secluded late-Victorian households, written almost entirely in mordantly witty dialogue. Although Compton-Burnett's had in 1911 published an earlier novel (Dolores), she considered that to have been an apprentice piece and she never listed it among her publications. Writing in The Spectator in 2009, the novelist Francis King noted that even in this early work Compton- Burnett had perfected her skill in implying what her characters think without either her or them openly revealing it. The novel includes some types, he said, that reappear in various guises in the author’s later works: tyrants who, though full of self pity, brutally victimise all those around them; and decent and loyal female slaves who dedicate themselves to the unrewarding task of trying to keep their families happy. King also considered it astonishing that, while E. M. Forster was agonising over whether he could publish his homosexual novel Maurice, Compton-Burnett, a seemingly prim spinster, \\"should have already embarked on dealing with unconventional sexuality with such candour and aplomb\\". Pamela Hansford Johnson noted that \\"this small, quiet, blistering book ... almost solid with conversations\\" came into the world in 1925, unrelated in any way to that year's actual realities, fantasies, hopes, and fears.

He acknowledged having still been a United States citizen on Nomination Day, but renounced his U.S. nationality prior to Election Day.

The name is a variant of \\"Sigmundsson\\", meaning son of Sigmund. https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Fitzsimmons/ The Gaelicisation of this surname is Mac Shíomóin. The name \\"FitzSymons\\" and its pre-standardization variants (Fitzsimons, Fitzsimmons, Fitz-Simons, etc.) is not a sept, or clan, name, but rather an individual patronymic passed down through various, yet discrete, colonial families arriving at different times in Irish history. Some families \\"went native\\" during the Gaelic revival of the 14th and 15th centuries, and many refused to endorse the Protestant Reformation. Others became important members of the Protestant Ascendancy and its supporting mittelstand. Two distinct families can be identified: those who arrived when the surname was first recorded in Ireland in 1177, attached to an adventurer seeking swordlands in Ulster, known as Sir John de Courcy of Carrickfergus Castle, earl of Ulster. These Fitzsimons are now native to the east-central seaboard of Ulster, in Lecale, Ards and Down. In 1323, a junior member of the Fitzsymons' of Simonshide, Herefordshire, settled in Dublin. This family is thought to be distinct from the Ulster Fitzsimons. Settling in Dublin, and the north and south reaches of Dublin County, they expanded into Meath, Westmeath, King's and Queen's County of the central English Pale. This branch may have been the root of the Wexford Fitzsimons family which produced a Signer of the Declaration of Independence (or the Wexford family may have sprung from a Norman adventurer arriving with Strongbow). Of the Pale Fitzsimons, it is thought discrete branches settled at Tullynally, County Meath, the line of Sir William Johnson and 'went' native by intermarrying with the O'Reillys and MacMahons of south central Ulster. These are generally the families now with ties to County Cavan and County Longford. The English family which sent its youngest son to Dublin in 1323 died out in the name, only the Irish branch now survives. The name \\"Fitzsimons\\" is quite common in England itself. These originating in Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire are thought to be Scandinavian and of the genere Danus, as the area was settled by Danish Vikings and predate the Norman invasion in 1066 AD.

The owners of Enid station KUAL (for \\"Quality Radio\\") saw a local opportunity for a better callsign, and switched their station from beautiful music to a top 40 format—and applied for the recently abandoned KOFM call letters. KOFM originally launched with the slogan \\"Maximum Music\\". KOFM original on-air talent was JJ Scott in mornings, Frank Baker in Afternoons, also Keith Hillyard and J. Curtis Huckleberry. Beyond those day parts, much of KOFM was automated. Airing a diverse mix of Top 40 music, KOFM became one of the most popular radio stations in NW Oklahoma and its “Maximum Music Machine” remote broadcast vehicle could be found throughout NW Oklahoma. In the early 1990s, KOFM switched to Contemporary Country, a format that remains today. It is one of two live and local radio stations along with KGWA 960 AM serving Enid and the surrounding area reaching into 14 counties. It features the Clepper in the Morning radio show.

It is commonly used to estimate the power transfer between input and output of a linear system. If the signals are ergodic, and the system function is linear, it can be used to estimate the causality between the input and output. Definition and formulation The coherence (sometimes called magnitude-squared coherence) between two signals x(t) and y(t) is a real-valued function that is defined as:J. S. Bendat, A. G. Piersol, Random Data, Wiley-Interscience, 1986http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~wpenny/course/course.html, chapter 7 ::C_{xy}(f) = \\\\frac{G_{xy}(f)^2}{G_{xx}(f) G_{yy}(f)} where Gxy(f) is the Cross-spectral density between x and y, and Gxx(f) and Gyy(f) the autospectral density of x and y respectively. The magnitude of the spectral density is denoted as G. Given the restrictions noted above (ergodicity, linearity) the coherence function estimates the extent to which y(t) may be predicted from x(t) by an optimum linear least squares function. Values of coherence will always satisfy 0\\\\le C_{xy}(f)\\\\le 1. For an ideal constant parameter linear system with a single input x(t) and single output y(t), the coherence will be equal to one. To see this, consider a linear system with an impulse response h(t) defined as: y(t) = h(t) * x(t), where * denotes convolution. In the Fourier domain this equation becomes Y(f) = H(f)X(f), where Y(f) is the Fourier transform of y(t) and H(f) is the linear system transfer function. Since, for an ideal linear system: G_{yy} = H(f)^2G_{xx}(f) and G_{xy} = H(f)G_{xx}(f), and since G_{xx}(f) is real, the following identity holds, ::C_{xy}(f) = \\\\frac{H(f)G_{xx}(f)^2}{G_{xx}(f)G_{yy}(f)} = \\\\frac{H(f)G_{xx}(f)^2}{G_{xx}^2(f)H(f)^2} = \\\\frac{G_{xx}(f)^2}{G_{xx}^2(f)} = 1. However, in the physical world an ideal linear system is rarely realized, noise is an inherent component of system measurement, and it is likely that a single input, single output linear system is insufficient to capture the complete system dynamics. In cases where the ideal linear system assumptions are insufficient, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality guarantees a value of C_{xy}\\\\le 1. If Cxy is less than one but greater than zero it is an indication that either: noise is entering the measurements, that the assumed function relating x(t) and y(t) is not linear, or that y(t) is producing output due to input x(t) as well as other inputs. If the coherence is equal to zero, it is an indication that x(t) and y(t) are completely unrelated, given the constraints mentioned above. The coherence of a linear system therefore represents the fractional part of the output signal power that is produced by the input at that frequency. We can also view the quantity 1 - C_{xy} as an estimate of the fractional power of the output that is not contributed by the input at a particular frequency. This leads naturally to definition of the coherent output spectrum: ::G_{vv} = C_{xy} G_{yy} G_{vv} provides a spectral quantification of the output power that is uncorrelated with noise or other inputs.  Example  Figure 1: Coherence between ocean water level (input) and groundwater well level (output). Figure 2: Barometric pressure (black), ocean water levels (red), and groundwater well level (blue) near Lake Worth Florida during hurricane Frances. Here we illustrate the computation of coherence (denoted as \\\\gamma^2) as shown in figure 1. Consider the two signals shown in the lower portion of figure 2. There appears to be a close relationship between the ocean surface water levels and the groundwater well levels. It is also clear that the barometric pressure has an effect on both the ocean water levels and groundwater levels. Figure 3 shows the autospectral density of ocean water level over a long period of time. Figure 3: Autospectral density of ocean water level. The tidal components are labeled. As expected, most of the energy is centered on the well-known tidal frequencies. Likewise, the autospectral density of groundwater well levels are shown in figure 4. Figure 4: Autospectral density of groundwater well level. It is clear that variation of the groundwater levels have significant power at the ocean tidal frequencies. To estimate the extent at which the groundwater levels are influenced by the ocean surface levels, we compute the coherence between them. Let us assume that there is a linear relationship between the ocean surface height and the groundwater levels. We further assume that the ocean surface height controls the groundwater levels so that we take the ocean surface height as the input variable, and the groundwater well height as the output variable. The computed coherence (figure 1) indicates that at most of the major ocean tidal frequencies the variation of groundwater level at this particular site is over 90% due to the forcing of the ocean tides. However, one must exercise caution in attributing causality. If the relation (transfer function) between the input and output is nonlinear, then values of the coherence can be erroneous. Another common mistake is to assume a causal input/output relation between observed variables, when in fact the causative mechanism is not in the system model. For example, it is clear that the atmospheric barometric pressure induces a variation in both the ocean water levels and the groundwater levels, but the barometric pressure is not included in the system model as an input variable. We have also assumed that the ocean water levels drive or control the groundwater levels. In reality it is a combination of hydrological forcing from the ocean water levels and the tidal potential that are driving both the observed input and output signals. Additionally, noise introduced in the measurement process, or by the spectral signal processing can contribute to or corrupt the coherence. Extension to non-stationary signals If the signals are non-stationary, (and therefore not ergodic), the above formulations may not be appropriate. For such signals, the concept of coherence has been extended by using the concept of time-frequency distributions to represent the time-varying spectral variations of non-stationary signals in lieu of traditional spectra. For more details, see.  Application in neural science  Coherence has been found a great application to find dynamic functional connectivity in the brain networks. Studies show that the coherence between different brain regions can be changed during different mental or perceptual states. The brain coherence during the rest state can be affected by disorders and diseases.

It features the origin story of Saavik, and how she came to know Spock. Plot A Romulan Bird Of Prey drifts over the Neutral Zone and into Federation territory. Admiral James T. Kirk and the Enterprise take the ship back to Earth, unaware of the deadly force hiding inside. It is soon learned one way to battle the threat is via the traumatic childhood knowledge of Saavik and her birth planet Hellguard. Production Saavik's origins are first mentioned in Vonda McIntyre's novelization of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, where she is said to be half- Romulan and from a planet called Hellguard. Clowes expanded on this story to add that she was one of a number of feral children, which was reflected in later works by other authors such as Margaret Wander Bonanno in her novel Unspoken Truth. Carolyn Clowes was inspired to write a Star Trek novel by Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and the novelization by McIntyre. Clowes first submitted an outline and sample chapters to Pocket Books in 1985, with publication taking place in 1990. She said that \\"There was a great deal of back-and-forth with Pocket and Paramount over story, then endless revisions. So it took a while to get born.\\"Ayers (2006): p. 82 Reception Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer reflected on the book for Tor.com, comparing it to other similar Star Trek novels with Vulcan abduction stories. She considered Saavik to be a Mary Sue character, but one that she liked, and compared the book to works by author Robert A. Heinlein. However, she thought that the downside to the book was that the resolution of the Saavik and Spock story was their encounter during his pon farr during The Search For Spock, a film that Clowes acknowledged in the book.

He resigned his commission as a Lieutenant to attend graduate school. Early business career Bello entered the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College, graduating with an MBA in 1974. While at Tuck he was named an Edward Tuck Scholar. After Tuck, his first business position was in brand management at General Foods, where he worked on Sanka and Maxwell House coffee brands.

National Football League Properties In 1979, he joined NFL Properties (NFLP), the marketing and merchandising arm of the National Football League, where he ascended to the position of President of NFL Properties in 1986. At NFLP, he helped transform licensed apparel from a small business selling novelty merchandise in specialty stores into everyday fashion transcending fan-wear, sold at major chain sporting goods and department stores. In addition to creating NFL ProLine authentic sideline gear and apparel made available to consumers to so that they could \\"Wear What the Pros Wear\\", Bello drove major sponsorships with Coke, Canon, Gatorade, Miller Brewing, GTE, Apple, Citibank, American Airlines and many consumer food products through a Sunday insert program called the \\"NFL Tailgate Party.\\" He also played a major role in creating the NFL Experience, a fan festival that is now a fixture and fan favorite at Super Bowls. Also, Bello helped organize the American Bowl series of international pre-season games starting with the 1986 game between the Refrigerator Perry led Super Bowl Champion Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys played in front of 81,000 fans at London's Wembley Stadium. Bello's innovative approach to promoting and enhancing the NFL experience included bedecking pro golfer Payne Stewart in NFL Team colors as he played on the tour, sponsoring NASCAR racers, women's lines of NFL team clothing and made for TV events such as the Quarterback Challenge and The NFL's Fastest Man. During Bello's tenure at NFLP, the business grew from $30 million in retail sales, sponsorships and publishing to $3 billion when he left in 1993. Bello is broadly credited with creating the model by which every major sports league now operates.E-Clips; Cornell University Department of Applied Economics and Management He was ranked 46th on Sporting News' list of Most Powerful People in Sports in 1992. Bello left NFLP on Labor Day in 1993 amid controversy. He resigned as a result of losing a power struggle with then-NFL Commissioner Paul TagliabueNew York Times, 3/31/1994 who was seeking to consolidate league operations under the commissioner's office. SoBe Beverages Upon his departure from the NFL, Bello took a position as VP Marketing with Brooklyn, New York-based Ferolito, Vultaggio and Sons, makers of AriZona iced tea. At AriZona he joined a former Pepsi colleague Mike Schott, then COO of AriZona Beverages. After four months he left AriZona to create his own beverage company in partnership with Tom Schwalm that became the South Beach Beverage Company, named after the trendy South Beach area of Miami. The new company, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, marketed so-called \\"New Age\\" beverages—exotic juice blends and ready-to-drink iced teas—but faced formidable competition from its predecessors, including Snapple, Mystic, Nantucket Nectars and AriZona. South Beach needed a point of differentiation in the marketplace, so Bello added trace elements of various herbs and nutrientsBusiness Week, October 8, 2003—such as ginseng, ginkgo biloba, guarana, carnitine, Echinacea, yohimbe, taurine and praline—and promoted their benefits beyond hydration. He launched a \\"3G\\" line of drinks, which included supposed energy boosters like ginseng, ginkgo biloba and guarana. He also expanded the brand's iced tea portfolio to include more exotic offerings such as Black Tea, Oolong Tea (with bee pollen), Green Tea (with Echinacea) and Red Tea (with selenium). Under Bello's direction, SoBe launched a line of \\"3C\\" Elixirs (containing calcium, carnitine and chromium) in varieties such as Orange-Carrot, Orange-Tomato (including lycopene), Energy (with guarana, yohimbe and arginina), Power (taurine, creatine and praline), Zen Blend (triple ginseng tea with schizandra), Wisdom (with ginkgo biloba, St. John's wort and gotu kola) and Eros (with dong quai, damiana, foti and zink).Beverage Industry, July 1998 He created the \\"dueling lizards\\" designEvans, Judith, and Cullen, Cheryl Dangle, Challenging the Big Brands, Rockport Publishers Inc., Gloucester, Mass., 2003, , page 122 and took a lead role in the company's guerrilla marketing effort, proclaiming himself as the \\"Lizard King\\" in radio advertisements. He gave the brand an \\"attitude\\" by enlisting athletes who were somewhat out of the mainstream—such as golfer John Daly and downhill skier Bode Miller—as official spokespersons for the brand. The SoBe marketing team also wooed independent beverage distributors, offering them very high margins and a small chunk of equity in the company.E-Clips; Cornell University Department of Applied Economics and Management From its creation in 1995, SoBe's sales rose rapidly and climbed to $275 million by 2000.The New York Times, July 20, 2000 The following year, the brand rode the \\"good-for-you\\" trend among American consumers to break the quarter billion dollar barrier in 2000.Tufts University E-News, 08/02/2001 SoBe was sold to PepsiCo for a reported $370 million cash on October 30, 2000.The New York Times, 10/31/2000 Bello remained with Pepsi overseeing SoBe until early 2004. By the end of 1999 the company had sold 14.8 million cases of drinks and taken in $166.4 million. South Beach challenged rival AriZona in sales and was pursuing Snapple for leadership in the new age drink category. Less than pleased, rival AriZona slapped the company with a lawsuit claiming that SoBe had copied its bottle design or stolen trade secrets. Then Judge Sonia Sotomayor ruled in SoBe's favor denying a preliminary injunction. Legal action proceeded and persisted on the federal and state level until 2007, long after the company had been sold to PepsiCo. In 2007, the court dismissed all AriZona claims on summary judgementBeverage Marketing USA Inc., v. South Beach Beverage Corp., 2000 U.S. Dist.

With former NFL associates Bruce Burke and Peter French, Bello formed Firefighter Brands, a social enterprise intended to benefit local firefighting units with revenues generated from the sale of Firefighter Branded coffee, chips, chili's, trail mixes and energy drinks. The project was supported by a group of well to do and high-profile community minded investors but ultimately failed due to lack of cohesive co-operation among various firefighting entities. In 2005, Bello invested in and became chairman of Soup Kitchen International, a company he helped found that markets soups created by Al Yeganeh, the New York-based soup chef made famous as the \\"Soup Nazi\\" on the popular Seinfeld TV show, for retail stores, and developed franchised restaurants.The New York Times, 6/26/2005 In 2006 Bello became a general partner of Sherbrooke Capital, a venture capital firm that provides growth capital to early-stage health and wellness companies that led the $6.35 million equity-financing round for IZZE in early 2005. In the spring of 2006, Bello was appointed Chairman of the Board of the IZZE Beverage Company, a maker of sparkling juices.VendingMarketWatch News, May 2, 2006 Izze was subsequently sold to PepsiCo for an undisclosed sum.

The finished product might be stored in the building, sometimes for a year or more.\\"Old Smokehouses\\". Wedlinydomowe.com. Accessed May 2010. Even when smoke is not used, such a building—typically a subsidiary building—is sometimes referred to as a \\"smoke house.\\" When smoke is not used, the term \\"meat house\\" is common. History Traditional smokehouses served both as meat smokers and to store the meats, often for groups and communities of people. Food preservation occurred by salt curing and extended cold smoking for two weeks or longer. Smokehouses were always secured to prevent animals and thieves from accessing the food. The meat is hung to keep it from the reach of varmints and vermin. Prior to the widespread availability of mains electricity and freezers, meat was preserved by heavy salting. Hogs were slaughtered after the onset of cold weather, and hams and other pork products were salted and hung up or placed on a shelf to last into the following summer. Whether the meat should be smoked as well as salted is personal preference, frequently backed up with strong local or family custom. Design and use Traditionally, a smokehouse is a small enclosed outbuilding often with a vent, a single entrance, no windows, and frequently has a gabled or pyramid-style roof. Communal and commercial smokehouses are larger than those that served a single residence or estate. The use of slightly warmed, dry air from a very slow hardwood fire will ensure the proper drying of meats.\\"Building a Smokehouse\\" Accessed May 2010 As a preserved ham represents a big financial investment, smokehouses in the Carolinas and Virginia can frequently be identified by their framing, so closely spaced as to prevent forcible entry and theft. The lower interior walls of both meat houses and smoke houses are characterized by the extreme furring of the wood, caused by the salt. The upper areas of smokehouses are blackened with smoke. A meat house has a solid wood floor, a smokehouse will have a brick pit in the center of the dirt floor, or sometimes a broken/cast- off cast iron pot, for the fire. Jefferson's smokehouse at Monticello is an integral part of the brick outbuildings. It has a conventional brick fireplace built into an exterior wall – its flue discharges into the smokehouse.

Gene then crossed 25°S on February 3 and Nadi released their final advisory. Cyclone Gene continued as a Tropical Cyclone for three days before becoming an extratropical cyclone. Early on February 6 TCWC Wellington released their final advisory on tropical cyclone Gene as they declared it as extratropical. Cyclone Gene caused widespread damage to several of Fiji's main islands, including Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Yasawa, Mamanuca, and other outlying island groups, while killing a total of 8 people. The cyclone also caused severe damage to Vanautu's Futuna island after its outer bands lashed the island with gale force windspeeds and heavy rain for 12 hours. __TOC__ Meteorological history During January 26, the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a weak tropical disturbance that had developed within the monsoon trough about to the northeast of the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. The disturbance initially moved towards the southeast before it recurved and started to move towards the southwest and Fiji during the next day, while gradually developing further in an area of low vertical windshear. At 1800 UTC on January 27, the JTWC reported that the disturbance had developed into Tropical Cyclone 15P and started to issue warnings on it as the 1-minute windspeeds had become equivalent to a tropical storm. Over the next 6–12 hours, the disturbance moved towards the southwest and hugged Vanua Levu's southeastern coast, under the influence of a mid level ridge of high pressure that was located to the southeast of the system. 15P's development was hindered while it was located over land, however it did not weaken significantly because it was located in an area of favourable upper level conditions. While over land the system moved towards the south-southwest and moved into the Bligh Waters, where it started to rapidly intensify as convection erupted around the system. As a result, before the system made landfall on Viti Levu, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian cyclone intensity scale and named it Gene. The system then made landfall shortly after 0600 UTC near Lautoka, before it started to move westwards and passed near Nadi before it moved out of the archipelago. Early on January 29 as the system moved westwards, RSMC Nadi reported that Gene had intensified into a category two tropical cyclone before it briefly weakened into a Category 1 because of the effects of a moderate amount of vertical windshear. However, the system quickly reintensified and by 1200 UTC the next day had become a category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone and equivalent to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Tropical Cyclone Gene near Vanuatu on January 31 On January 31, while the storm was moving closer to Vanuatu, Gene attained peak winds of 150 km/h (95 mph10 min) & 185 km/h (115 mph 1-min) Thus, Cyclone Gene was a Category 3 cyclone on the Australian scale and the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. During February 1, as Cyclone Gene was moving to the west, Gene recurved and started moving towards the south and missed Vanuatu. The next day cyclone Gene started to temporarily weaken again by becoming a category two cyclone with winds speeds of 95 km/h (60 mph 10 min). This came as cyclone Gene approached 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility, to the south of 25°S the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand, monitors tropical cyclones, south of 25°S. As Gene crossed in to TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, Cyclone Gene started to re-intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120 km/h (105 mph 10 min) however this re-intensification only lasted for 12 hours before Gene began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day. Gene slowly weakened over the next couple of days as it moved towards the south east. The JTWC then issued its final warning on February 6 as Cyclone Gene was finishing its extratropical transition, and had also become fully embedded within the baroclinic zone. TCWC Wellington continued to monitor the extratropical remnants of Gene until February 9, after the sustained windspeeds had dropped to below 65 km/h (40 mph). Effects Tropical Cyclone Gene on February 4 Fiji On January 27, RSMC Nadi issued strong wind warnings for Fiji, as 12F was expected to affect Fiji but not develop into a tropical cyclone until it had moved out of the archipelago. However, as 12F rapidly developed into a tropical cyclone during that day, RSMC Nadi was forced to issue gale force wind warnings for various parts of Fiji including Vanua Levu, Viti Levu, Beqa, Vatulele, Lomaiviti, Yasawa and Mamanuca. When Cyclone Gene hit Fiji, it caused widespread minor damage on both of the main islands of Fiji including Vanua Levu and Viti Levu as well as a few of the other minor islands in Fiji which included Taveuni & the Yasawa group of islands. Power cuts were reported in at least half of Fiji including Suva and Nadi however power was quickly restored to these areas. Within Fiji over 340 people evacuated to 61 evacuation centres which were opened by the Fijian government. There was also 61 houses completely flattened by cyclone Gene. The effects of Cyclone Gene were compounded by continuous heavy rainfall and subsequent floods in most parts of Viti Levu. As a result, there was significant disruption to water supplies, with several sources becoming contaminated and destroyed as a result there were several cases of Typhoid reported in Fiji with at least 1 person dying from typhoid. There was also seven other deaths from cyclone Gene, five of these were directly related whilst two people were also killed as an indirect result of Cyclone Gene from house fires while using candles to light their homes when the power went out. Within their end of season report RSMC Nadi reported that the total cost of Cyclone Gene was F$51 million (2008), ($35 million 2008 USD). Vanuatu After exiting the Fijian archipelago of islands, Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific, towards Vanuatu, and was predicted to affect the archipelago between January 31 and February 2. However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast and as a result did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outer bands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while sparing other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused damages to buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of damages to waterlines from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial survey found that more than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone.

Papenfuse (born October 15, 1943) is the retired Maryland State Archivist and Commissioner of Land Patents. Papenfuse received his undergraduate degree from the American University, an M.A. from the University of Colorado, and a Ph.D. in history from The Johns Hopkins University. He holds an honorary doctorate of letters from Washington College. His son Eric is the mayor of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, since 2014. Biography Papenfuse held the positions of Maryland State Archivist and Commissioner of Land Patents from 1975 until 2013. He succeeded Morris L. Radoff to the office and was succeeded himself by Timothy D. Baker. As director of the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis, Papenfuse was responsible for the Archives' collection of government and private materials which are described and inventoried in detail at mdsa.net, Guide to Government Records and the Guide Special Collections. In 2003, he conceptualized and initiated the design of mdlandrec.net, which contains over 200,000,000 indexed images of permanent archival records and has public usage statistics. In addition he has created an interactive editorial website for archival documents which currently accesses over 500,000 pages of original source material on the experimental web sites, Remembering Baltimore, mdhistory.net, and virtual archive.us. From June 2010 until October 2013, he was also the acting City Archivist for the Baltimore City Archives, becoming a catalyst for change in an archives in disrepair. Papenfuse played a major role in the design of the present Archives building which was completed in 1986 and bears his name, initiated the creation of the Maryland State Archives web site, writes extensively on Maryland history, and has taught history at the University of Maryland College Park, the University of Maryland Law School, and the Johns Hopkins University. He is the author of numerous articles and books, including In Pursuit of Profit: The Annapolis Merchants in the Era of the American Revolution (1975), with Joseph M. Coale, The Hammond-Harwood House Atlas of Historical Maps of Maryland, 1608-1908 (1982) and The Maryland State Archives Atlas of Historical Maps of Maryland 1608-1908 (2003). He has also developed an approach to providing reference services and teaching courses on the Internet. The Baltimore City Archives website, for which he designed the organizational framework and wrote most of the introductory text, is devoted to preserving and accessing the public records of the Baltimore City Archives. Papenfuse has published numerous articles on archives and archival-related matters including a report on access to government records in the OAH Newsletter. In April 2011, he was designated a digital pioneer and interviewed by the Library of Congress about his career. As Commissioner of Land Patents, Papenfuse presided as an administrative judge over questions relating to original title in Maryland, and was responsible for overseeing the granting of a number of land grants based upon thorough research and documentation. He explains the process at length in a published opinion that was decided in his favor and which incorporated his research of the process into the opinion.Marquardt v. Papenfuse, 92 Md.

World Have Your Say won Gold in the 2008 Sony Radio Awards, in the category Listener Participation.Sony Radio Awards Winners 2008 The show described itself as \\"the BBC News programme where you set the agenda.\\" Typically each edition addressed a question, or number of questions, raised by the users of its blog and Facebook site, as well as emailers to the BBC. It encouraged callers to talk to each other and directed questions asked by listeners to the guests on the programme, intervening as little as possible to keep the show more of a conversation than a talk show. The show also occasionally worked as a forum for the BBC World Service's global audience to put questions to a particular guest. Previous guests included Aung San Suu Kyi, Philip Pullman and Thilo Sarrazin. History The BBC World Service launched the programme in October 2005, featuring Anu Anand and Steve Richards as presenters and Mark Sandell as editor. Ros Atkins replaced Richards in early 2006 as the main presenter. Since February 2011 the programme had a weekly television edition on BBC World News on Fridays produced by the same production team. Topics for discussions were set by listeners,BBC NEWS: World Have Your Say - What is World Have Your Say? who could email the show prior to it going on air each day, or even call into the studio office. Some of the comments left on the WHYS blog and Facebook site, together with emails, Tweets and SMS text messages, were read on the air. Callers from all over the world were the key part of the programme by calling in and debating the daily topic. On occasion, the show would leave the studio and go on the road, to discuss subjects from a particular country but often with a global impact. For example, in 2011, they went to Berlin to discuss the legacy of Nazism in Germany, Jakarta to talk about revolution in a Muslim country, and Bangkok to talk about sex tourism. Most of the time, the topics for the days' show were offered by e-mail. Some stories were suggested by a single person, others by the number of people wanting to talk about it. Increasingly, use was made of the programme's Facebook site as a source of comment on news stories. Sometimes, these were stories from the listeners' point of view. In fact, some of the reporting of current events for the show was done by real world people, most with no journalism experience. Television BBC World News began presenting a version of the programme in 2011 with Ros Atkins as the presenter. The programme, presented on Fridays at 1500 GMT, encouraged viewer discussion on some of the top stories from the week. Occasionally, correspondents and high-profile individuals close to the issue at hand would join in the conversation. Similarly to the version on radio, the programme heavily utilised social media; especially Twitter and Facebook. As of late 2013, Chloe Tilley played a more active role as a presenter.

Crash Following takeoff from Jean Lesage International Airport, the flight crew advised the control tower of a problem with their right engine. The plane was given clearance for an emergency landing. It circled the airport twice with flames emanating from one engine.

Genealogy in Tragedy, Disasters, Fires, Floods Investigation The flight data recorders were recovered soon after the crash. Canadian investigators concluded that shortly after the twin-turboprop airliner lifted off, the low pressure impeller from the no. 2 engine burst, causing the forward part of the engine to separate. The flight crew were unable to raise the landing gear because debris from the engine damaged the electronic gear selection circuitry. This, together with the exposed engine, increased the aerodynamic drag dramatically, and the aircraft was unable to climb or maintain altitude during its final turn. The center of gravity shifted beyond its aft limit due to the engine separation and passenger movement, causing the airspeed to drop below the minimum control speed shortly before the aircraft struck the hillside.ASN Aircraft accident Fairchild F-27 CF-QBL Quebec, QC References Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1979 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Canada Category:Quebecair accidents and incidents Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Fairchild F-27 Category:March 1979 events in Canada Category:1979 in Quebec ","title":"Quebecair Flight 255"},{"id":"18652084","text":"Scratching the Surface is a 1968 blues album recorded by The Groundhogs and released by Liberty Records.

He was awarded a John Tyndall Fellowship and studied for a year in Berlin before returning to earn his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1896. After teaching for a year at the University of Michigan, he became an associate professor of physics at Oberlin College. He made professor in 1899 and became Dean of the College of Arts and Science in 1907. In May 1908 at the age of 51 he joined the staff at Mount Wilson Observatory. There he studied the Sun, observing sun spots, the structure of the solar atmosphere, examined the Sun's element composition using spectroscopy, and so forth. In his later work, he spent much time working to confirm the theory of general relativity. He also made observations of the planet Venus, showing that there was insufficient oxygen in the atmosphere to support life (as we know it). Between 1909 and 1930 he published 80 papers.

Model parameters and experimental data from PolymerFEM.com The Yeoh hyperelastic material modelYeoh, O. H., 1993, \\"Some forms of the strain energy function for rubber,\\" Rubber Chemistry and technology, Volume 66, Issue 5, November 1993, Pages 754-771. is a phenomenological model for the deformation of nearly incompressible, nonlinear elastic materials such as rubber. The model is based on Ronald Rivlin's observation that the elastic properties of rubber may be described using a strain energy density function which is a power series in the strain invariants I_1, I_2, I_3 of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensors.Rivlin, R. S., 1948, \\"Some applications of elasticity theory to rubber engineering\\", in Collected Papers of R. S. Rivlin vol. 1 and 2, Springer, 1997. The Yeoh model for incompressible rubber is a function only of I_1. For compressible rubbers, a dependence on I_3 is added on. Since a polynomial form of the strain energy density function is used but all the three invariants of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor are not, the Yeoh model is also called the reduced polynomial model.  Yeoh model for incompressible rubbers = Strain energy density function  The original model proposed by Yeoh had a cubic form with only I_1 dependence and is applicable to purely incompressible materials. The strain energy density for this model is written as : W = \\\\sum_{i=1}^3 C_i~(I_1-3)^i where C_i are material constants. The quantity 2 C_1 can be interpreted as the initial shear modulus. Today a slightly more generalized version of the Yeoh model is used.Selvadurai, A. P. S., 2006, \\"Deflections of a rubber membrane\\", Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, vol. 54, no. 6, pp. 1093-1119. This model includes n terms and is written as : W = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n C_i~(I_1-3)^i ~. When n=1 the Yeoh model reduces to the neo-Hookean model for incompressible materials. For consistency with linear elasticity the Yeoh model has to satisfy the condition : 2\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial I_1}(3) = \\\\mu ~~(i e j) where \\\\mu is the shear modulus of the material. Now, at I_1 = 3 (\\\\lambda_i = \\\\lambda_j = 1), : \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial I_1} = C_1 Therefore, the consistency condition for the Yeoh model is : 2C_1 = \\\\mu\\\\,  Stress-deformation relations  The Cauchy stress for the incompressible Yeoh model is given by : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = -p~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathit{1}} + 2~\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial I_1}~\\\\boldsymbol{B} ~;~~ \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial I_1} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n i~C_i~(I_1-3)^{i-1} ~. = Uniaxial extension = For uniaxial extension in the \\\\mathbf{n}_1-direction, the principal stretches are \\\\lambda_1 = \\\\lambda,~ \\\\lambda_2=\\\\lambda_3. From incompressibility \\\\lambda_1~\\\\lambda_2~\\\\lambda_3=1. Hence \\\\lambda_2^2=\\\\lambda_3^2=1/\\\\lambda. Therefore, : I_1 = \\\\lambda_1^2+\\\\lambda_2^2+\\\\lambda_3^2 = \\\\lambda^2 + \\\\cfrac{2}{\\\\lambda} ~.

Yeoh model for compressible rubbers  A version of the Yeoh model that includes I_3 = J^2 dependence is used for compressible rubbers. The strain energy density function for this model is written as : W = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n C_{i0}~(\\\\bar{I}_1-3)^i + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n C_{k1}~(J-1)^{2k} where \\\\bar{I}_1 = J^{-2/3}~I_1, and C_{i0}, C_{k1} are material constants. The quantity C_{10} is interpreted as half the initial shear modulus, while C_{11} is interpreted as half the initial bulk modulus. When n=1 the compressible Yeoh model reduces to the neo-Hookean model for incompressible materials.

When cyclically shifted versions of a Zadoff-Chu sequence are imposed upon a signal the resulting set of signals detected at the receiver are uncorrelated with one another. They are named after Solomon A. Zadoff, David C. Chu and Robert L. Frank.  Description  Zadoff-Chu sequences exhibit the useful property that cyclically shifted versions of themselves are orthogonal to one another, provided that each cyclic shift, when viewed within the time domain of the signal, is greater than the combined propagation delay and multipath delay spread of the signal between the transmitter and receiver. A generated Zadoff–Chu sequence that has not been shifted is known as a root sequence. Plot of a Zadoff-Chu sequence for u=7, N=353 The complex value at each position n of each root Zadoff–Chu sequence parametrised by u is given by : x_u(n)=\\\\text{exp}\\\\left(-j\\\\frac{\\\\pi un(n+c_\\\\text{f}+2q)}{N_\\\\text{ZC}}\\\\right), \\\\, where : 0 \\\\le n < N_\\\\text{ZC}, : 0 < u < N_\\\\text{ZC} and \\\\text{gcd}(N_\\\\text{ZC},u)=1, : c_\\\\text{f} = N_\\\\text{ZC} \\\\mod 2, : q \\\\in \\\\Z, : N_\\\\text{ZC} = \\\\text{length of sequence}. Zadoff–Chu sequences are CAZAC sequences (constant amplitude zero autocorrelation waveform). Note that the special case q = 0 results in a Chu sequence, and that q eq 0 results in cyclic shifts of the Chu sequence by q terms.  Properties of Zadoff-Chu sequences  1\\\\. They are periodic with period N_\\\\text{ZC} if N_\\\\text{ZC} is odd. : x_u ( n + N_{\\\\text{ZC}} )= x_u(n) 2\\\\. If N_\\\\text{ZC} is prime, the Discrete Fourier Transform of a Zadoff–Chu sequence is another Zadoff–Chu sequence conjugated, scaled and time scaled. : X_{u}[k]= x_{u}^{*}(\\\\tilde{u}k) X_{u}[0] where \\\\tilde{u} is the multiplicative inverse of u modulo N_\\\\text{ZC} . 3\\\\. The auto correlation of a Zadoff–Chu sequence with a cyclically shifted version of itself is zero, i.e., it is non-zero only at one instant which corresponds to the cyclic shift. 4\\\\. The cross-correlation between two prime length Zadoff–Chu sequences, i.e. different values of u, u=u_1, u=u_2 , is constant 1/{\\\\sqrt{N_\\\\text{ZC}}} , provided that u_1 - u_2 is relatively prime to N_\\\\text{ZC} .  Usages  Zadoff–Chu sequences are used in the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) air interface in the Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS), random access preamble (PRACH), uplink control channel (PUCCH), uplink traffic channel (PUSCH) and sounding reference signals (SRS). By assigning orthogonal Zadoff–Chu sequences to each LTE eNodeB and multiplying their transmissions by their respective codes, the cross-correlation of simultaneous eNodeB transmissions is reduced, thus reducing inter-cell interference and uniquely identifying eNodeB transmissions. Zadoff–Chu sequences are an improvement over the Walsh–Hadamard codes used in UMTS because they result in a constant- amplitude output signal, reducing the cost and complexity of the radio's power amplifier.

Its main function was to provide a secure speech link between the train driver and the signaller which could not be overheard by other train drivers. In areas where CSR was used it had to be the primary method of communication between driver and signaller, always being used in preference to the signal post telephone. CSR was replaced by the GSM-R digital system, forming the initial phase of rollout of ERTMS throughout the UK.  History  CSR was first introduced in the Glasgow area in 1986 to enable driver-only operation of trains. It was later used in the London and Liverpool areas.In the Railway rule book there is provision for a driver stopped at a red signal to disembark the train and access a track-side telephone in order to talk to the signalman. This might be occasioned by a scenario where there was a track circuit failure and the signals had reverted to the safe condition. The rule book however also requires the train to be continuously manned during normal running operations. CSR was first introduced to allow the driver to talk to the signalman without leaving the train. The safety features associated with CSR whereby a signalman can send an alarm to a train or order a train to stop using a single data transmission service later secured CSR as a safety facility that could be deployed on a more universal basis. However it wasn't until the Clapham Rail disaster and subsequent Hidden report also followed by the accident at Cowden where the real value of the facility was learned.  Functions  * Signaller can call and speak to driver. * Driver can call and speak to signaller. * Signaller and driver can exchange preset text messages. * Signaller can send emergency stop messages to a particular train, or all trains in an area. * Driver can make an emergency call to signaller. * Signaller can speak to passengers via the train's public address system. * Signaller can connect driver to the railway telephone network. * Signaller notified if DSD is released after a DSD alarm displays for 30 seconds on the radio  Use  Marker board for the start of CSR area 39 on MerseyrailThe driver initialised the CSR with an area code followed by the identification number of the signal in front of the train. The radio then automatically sent the stock number of the train (e.g., 455112), to the signalling system. The signaller then allocated a train reporting number (e.g., 2M34) to the train. This reporting number was used by the signalling equipment to track the progress of the train as it moves through the rail network. Each signalling area (or signal panel within a larger signalbox) used a different radio channel corresponding with an area code. As the train passed from the jurisdiction of one signaller to another, the CSR in the driver's cab changed channel automatically. Lineside signs were provided to inform the driver of where the area code changes. Occasionally the radio failed to change channel or lost the signal completely, in which case the driver could enter the code manually. Lineside signs indicated the change of the CSR radio channel area.  Hardware  CSR cab equipment was either the Stornophone 6000 or a Siemens model.

Leatherman's Handbook, with illustrations by Sean, was among the first books to popularize BDSM among the general public. Biography Born Michael Lawrence Townsend, he grew up as a teenager in Los Angeles, where his neighbors included Noël Coward, Irene Dunne, and Laura Hope Crews. He attended the Peddie School and was stationed as Staff Sergeant in charge of NCOIC Operations of Air Intelligence Squadrons from 1950 through 1954 with the United States Air Force in Germany.Laird, Cynthia. \\"Obituaries: Leather author Larry Townsend dies\\", Bay Area Reporter, August 6, 2008. Accessed July 23, 2019. Completing his tour of duty, he entered into the small, underground LA leather scene where he and Montgomery Clift shared a lover. With his degree in industrial psychology from UCLA (1957), he worked in the private sector and as a probation officer with the Forestry Service. He began his pioneering activism in the politics of homophile liberation in the early 1960s. During this time he met Fred Yerkes (August 27, 1935 - July 8, 2006), who would become his companion of 43 years. In 1972, as president of the 'Homophile Effort for Legal Protection' which had been founded in 1969 to defend gays during and after arrests, he led a group in founding the H.E.L.P. Newsletter, the forebear of Drummer Magazine (1975). He lived in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, the center of the Los Angeles leather scene (the equivalent of the SoMa neighborhood in San Francisco). As a writer and photographer, he was an essential eyewitness of the drama and salon around Drummer, which often excerpted his novels. Townsend's signature \\"Leather Notebook\\" column appeared in Drummer for twelve years beginning in 1980, and continued in Honcho to 2008. His last novel, TimeMasters, was published April 2008. His last writing was Who Lit up the Lit of the Golden Age of Drummer an introduction to Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer (June 2008). Honors In 1995 Townsend received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International. In 2016 Townsend was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame. External links * Spill a Drop for Lost Brothers: Larry Townsend, author, The Leatherman's Handbook, by Jack Fritscher.

More specifically, it is a member of the Lechitic branch of the West Slavic languages, along with other languages spoken in areas within or close to the area of modern Poland, including Kashubian, Silesian, and the extinct Slovincian and Polabian. The history of the language can be divided into four periods of development: Old Polish, up to the start of the 16th century; Middle Polish, from the 16th century until the end of the 18th century; New Polish, up to 1930; and Modern Polish, since 1930.

Changes in grammar = Declension  Nouns = The declension of nouns has simplified. It now depends on the gender of a noun (smok, o smoku – foka, o foce) (a dragon, about a dragon - a seal, about a seal) and to some extent on the hardness of a noun's stem (liść, liście – list, listy) (leaf - leaves, letter - letters). Two categories have appeared in the masculine gender: the category of animacy and that of personhood (but, widzę but, widzę buty – kot, widzę kota, widzę koty – pilot, widzę pilota, widzę pilotów) (a shoe, I see a shoe, I see shoes - a cat, I see a cat, I see cats - a pilot, I see a pilot, I see pilots). Traces of consonant stems still remain but almost exclusively in neuter noun stems ending in -en, -ent- (cielę – cielęcia, imię – imienia) (a calf - of a calf, a name - of a name). For all other stems, the long or short form has become characteristic of all cases. In general, in the past endings characteristic of stems ending in -o-, -jo- and -a-, -ja- were most common. Other endings were disappearing. The endings which did not cause the alteration of the stem were becoming more popular. Traces of the lack of softness in some forms of words softened by front vowels (mainly forms ending with a consonant or ending with -i-, e.g. krъvaxъ > *krwach > krwiach) have disappeared. Often softness is the only remnant of old noun endings (Gen. kamane > kamienia) (of stone).  Singular = Nominative  The disappearance of short forms of stems may be interpreted as the result of the introduction of the accusative noun form into the nominative. : kamy > *kamy > kamień (kamenь) (stone) :: kry > *kry > krew (por. krъvь) (blood) For neuter nouns the ending -ьje sometimes produced a constricted -é (weselé) (wedding). Names of institutions such as podkomorzé, due to the influence of names such as łowczy (hunting), since the 16th century have been declined as adjectives: podkomorzy (chamberlain).  Genitive  The ending -y has come to be applied to all feminine nouns. The ending -a has come to be applied to all neuter nouns and to the majority of masculine nouns. In the 16th century, the ending -å, in other words non-acute -a, was applied to neuter stems ending in -ьje: oká (of an eye) but wesela (of a wedding). After a period of frequent changes (which still has not ended) the ending -u is still applied to some masculine non-personal nouns, but there is no major connection with the original form. Until the 16th century, the ending -ej, used in the declension of pronouns, was applied to all nouns in the genitive and dative and to feminine nouns in the locative if a noun had an old stem ending in -ja-: paniej, rolej, duszej (lord, role, soul).  Dative  The ending -'e is still applied to feminine nouns with stems ending in -a-. The ending -y is still applied to feminine soft-stem nouns. Occasionally, in the Old Polish ending -y was applied to neuter nouns with stems ending in a consonant: dziecięci, książęci (child, prince). The ending -owi has come to be applied to almost all stems of masculine nouns. Occasionally, it was applied to stems of neuter nouns. The ending -ewi from Old Polish was sometimes applied instead of the ending -owi to the soft-stem nouns and in the 15th and 16th century it started to also be applied to hard-stem nouns. The ending -u has come to be applied to all stems of neuter nouns. It is still applied to some masculine noun forms ending in -o-, -jo-. Until the 16th century it was used more frequently, especially following the preposition ku (człowieku (human), głosu (voice), ku południu (towards the south)).  Accusative  The accusative has remained the same as the nominative for all neuter nouns. For masculine nouns, the accusative has remained the same as the nominative for inanimate nouns and for animate nouns it has become the same as the genitive. The reason for this last change was most probably the free word order and the ambiguity that it could entail in phrases such as syn kocha ojciec (a son /nom./ loves a father /nom./) and ojciec kocha syn (a father /nom./ loves a son /nom./). The change of their forms into syn kocha ojca (son /nom./ loves father /acc./) and ojca kocha syn (father /acc./ loves son /nom./) helped to resolve this ambiguity. The accusative was the same as the nominative until the 14th - 15th century (in the region of Mazowsze until the 16th century), and nowadays this feature is preserved in common phrases such as iść za mąż (to get married), siąść na koń (to mount a horse), na miły Bóg (dear Lord!), być za pan brat (to be on intimate terms with sbd.). The ending -0 is still applied to stems of feminine nouns for which this same ending is applied also in the nominative. The ending -ę is still applied to the typically feminine nouns. In Old Polish the ending -ą was applied instead of -ę to nouns whose nominative ended with -å widzę duszę, boginię (I see a soul, a goddess) but wolą, pieczą (will, care). Nowadays, the only remnant of this rule is the accusative form panią (lady).  Instrumental  The ending -ą is still applied to all stems of feminine nouns. The ending -em has come to be applied to all stems of masculine and neuter nouns. The development of -ъmь, -ьmь has contributed to the stabilization of the use of this ending. The ending -im < -ьjemь was applied to neuter nouns ending in the old -ьje: wiesielim, miłosierdzim (joy, mercy), wyobrażenim (imagination).  Locative  The ending -'e is applied to hard-stem nouns. Until 15th - 16th century it was also applied to masculine and feminine nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch: Bodze (god), gresze (sin), mlece (milk). For noun stems ending in -n-: We dnie i w nocy (during the day and night), but in general: w dniu (during the day). The ending -y has come to be applied to all feminine soft- stem nouns. Until 14th - 15th century it was also applied to a very small number of stems ending in -jo-, especially i < -ьji for neuter nouns ending in -ьje. The ending -u has come to be applied to masculine and neuter hard-stem nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch. It has also survived in forms o synu, domu (about a son, about a house) and is also present in the form o panu (due to the influence of the phrase w Panu Bogu) (in the Lord God).  Vocative  The ending -'e (with -e, not -ě2, this is why there is the softening connected to the first palatalization) is applied to masculine hard-stem nouns. Until the 16th century it was also applied to nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch. Nowadays it is present in forms such as Boże, człowiecze, Kozacze (also człowieku, Kozaku), and also księże, additionally after -ec: ojcze, starcze(father, old man) (connected with the third palatalization). The ending -u has come to be applied to masculine soft-stem nouns ending in -k, -g, -ch and also feminine soft-stem nouns known as 'rodzinne' ('family nouns', used when addressing other family members) (ciociu, Helu) (auntie, Hela). It has also survived in forms such as synu, domu! (son, home!). The ending -o has survived in the old feminine nouns ending in -a- and has also spread onto the majority of old feminine nouns ending in -ja-. The ending -y is still applied to feminine nouns which stems in the nominative end with a consonant (myszy, kości!) (mice, bones!) and has spread onto the nouns of the same type as pani (lady). The forms of neuter nouns in the vocative have remained the same as their forms in the nominative.  Plural = Nominative  Until the 15th century the ending -i was the most widely applied ending to the stems of masculine nouns. From the 16th century onwards it was not applied to the stems of inanimate nouns, and from the 18th century – to the stems of nouns referring to non-persons. Forms Włoszy, mniszy (Italians, monks) have been replaced by Włosi, mnisi with the phonetic softness introduced in the 17th century. In the accusative -y was gradually replacing -i as the ending applied to the stems of masculine nouns. Since the 16th century it was applied even to the stems of nouns referring to persons. It was popular especially in the Enlightenment (syny, wnuki, greki) (sons, grandsons, Greeks). For feminine nouns it is still applied to the stems ending in -a- and also to some forms in the nominative singular ending in -0. The ending -e, derived from the stems ending in -i- (gost-ьje, lud-ьje) (guests, people), -n- (dьn-e, kamen-e, mestjan-e) (days, stones, townsmen) and forms such as przyjaciele, cesarze (friends, caesars), have dominated soft-stem masculine nouns. For feminine nouns it is still applied to the stems ending in -ja- and has spread onto some of the forms in the nominative singular ending in -0. The ending -owie in the 14th - 15th century was applied to all stems of masculine nouns. Since the 16th century it has been gradually disappearing, especially from inanimate nouns and those referring to nonpersons, still Norwid (1821–1883) used obłokowie (clouds) to make up a rhyme. In the Old Polish, soft-stem nouns sometimes had the ending -ewie applied instead of -owie. The ending -a is still applied to the stems of neuter nouns. Due to the influence of the Latin language, it has been applied since the 15th century to the stems of male nouns borrowed from Latin and German: akta, fundamenta, grunta, (files, foundations, grounds) and temporarily also to originally Polish nouns: okręta, pociska (ships, bullets). Nowadays, applying the ending -a to the stems of masculine nouns is generally not possible, however: akta (files)akty (acts). The names of offices such as podkomorzé until the 15th century also had the ending -a applied in the plural. In the 16th century forms chorążowie podczasze podchorąże ma pod sobą were widely used; nowadays in the nominative it is chorążowie (warrant officers), in the dative podchorążych (of cup bearers). The ending -´a (-´å) < -ьja today is used to construct forms such as brat – bracia (brother - brothers), ksiądz – księża (priest - priests). Initially, these forms were interpreted as collective nouns (bracia stała = braty stały) (brothers stood), księża poszła = księdzowie poszli (priests went), and were declined in the same way as female nouns (others of this type in the accusative had applied the ending -ą, in the genitive, dative and locative: -ej). In the writings of Skarga (1536–1612) they were declined in the same way as plural nouns (braciom, braćmi, braciach, księżom, księżmi, księżach) (brothers, priests). In dialect forms such as swaciå, muzykanciå, adwokaciå (matchmakers, musicians, lawyers)can be found.  Genitive  The ending -0 has started to be widely applied to neuter and feminine hard-stem nouns. For soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied is -y. Until the 17th century, its traces were present in the old masculine stems ending in -o-, -jo-: genitive woz (carriage), god, tysiąc (thousand), dziej, włos (hair). Nowadays, it is present in forms such as przyjaciół (friends), dotychczas (until now). The ending -ów has become characteristic of the masculine hard-stem nouns, for soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied is -y. In Old Polish it had a slightly different pronunciation and was more widely applied: pisarzow (of writers), koniow (of horses), dniow (of days), miesiącow (of months), in dialects: krolew (of kings). For soft-stem nouns the ending that is also applied instead of -ów/-0 is -y.  Dative  In the past, the ending -om has been widely applied to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns. Since the Middle Polish period it has started to be applied to the stems of feminine nouns. In Old Polish -am prevailed as the ending applied to the stems of feminine nouns. In the 15th - 17th century it was applied also to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns. The ending -em until the 17th century was sometimes applied instead of -om to the stems of masculine nouns. There are no traces of this ending being applied to the stems of neuter nouns. The endings -um, -óm in Old Polish were sometimes applied to the stems of neuter nouns instead of -om.  Accusative  Initially, the endings -e/-y in the masculine accusative were distributed as endings applied to the stems of non-person nominative nouns. However, in the 17th century the accusative was made the same as the genitive. This change became common in the 17th century. Old accusative was and still is used for stylistic reasons: króle (kings), pany (masters), chłopy (peasants). The forms of feminine and neuter nouns in the plural accusative have remained the same as in the plural nominative.  Instrumental  In the past, the ending -ami has been most widely applied to the stems of feminine nouns. Since the 15th century it came to be applied to the stems of neuter nouns and in the 16th - 17th century, despite the resistance of grammarians, to the stems of masculine nouns. The ending -mi was applied in Old Polish to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns, especially to soft-stem ones, and also to the stems of some feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0. In principle, today it is only applied to the stems of masculine and feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0 and having a phonetically soft-stem. The ending -y was applied in Old Polish to the stems of masculine and neuter nouns, especially to hard- stem ones. Until now it has survived in phrases such as tymi czasy (these days). The ending -oma, derived from the dual number, was applied to the stems of masculine nouns in the 16th - 17th century.  Locative  In the past, the ending -ach has been applied to feminine nouns. It could also be found in the masculine and neuter but came to be formally applied to nouns in these two genders in the 17th century. The ending -'ech was applied in the Old Polish to masculine and neuter nouns, especially those with hard-stem: wilcech (wolf), syniech (son), skrzydlech (wings), leciech. The traces have remained in the names of countries: Na Węgrzech (in Hungary). The ending -och was applied to nouns of all genders in the 14th - 16th century, especially to soft-stem nouns and also to those ending with -k, -g, -ch, most probably because of the influence of the endings such as -owie, -ów, -om.  Vocative  The plural vocative has remained the same as the nominative.  Mixed Declension  The mixed declension is characteristic of forms such as poeta (poet), mężczyzna (man), Jagiełło, Fredro, sędzia (judge). In Old Polish forms such as starosta (prefect), poeta (poet) were declined like feminine nouns. In the 16th century plural forms were changed due to their meaning (also plural dative such as mężczyznam). Until the 17th century, nouns such as Fredro in plural had forms Fredra, Fredrowi, Fredrę and so on. In the 15th century nouns such as sędzia < sądьja (judge) were given in singular genitive, dative and accusative forms like adjectives. Later on, forms such as sędzim, sędziem (judge) appeared in the instrumental. Sometimes the locative sędziej was also present. = Adjectives = The declension of adjectives as nouns has almost disappeared (exception: pełen) (full). The adjectival declension in combination with the pronoun jь has given rise to a new type of declension combining the two: adjectival and pronoun declensions. It is different from the noun declension: jego, tego białego słonia (his, of this white elephant). = Pronouns with genders = The declension of hard-stem pronouns with genders has assimilated to the declension of soft-stem ones. : těxъ > *ciech > tych jak ich (these as their) : togo > *togo > tego jak jego (this as his) Primarily, the singular feminine accusative ending was -ę. The form ją (her) was the only exception. Due to the influence of adjectives the use of the form -ą came to be more widely applied. Nowadays, the only existing form is tę. (In 1996 the accusative form tą was accepted as accepted as informal standard Polish.) = Pronouns without gender = They have undergone just slight changes: : azъ > jazъ > jaz > ja (I) : mene > *mienie > mnie (me) : kogo > kogo (without any major phonetic changes) : čьso > czso > cso > co (what) The old genitive čьso was transferred to the accusative and has spread to be applied to the nominative. The old accusative has preserved its prepositions: w niwecz < vъ nivъčь, przecz < prěčь, zacz < začь. = Numerals = Ordinal, multiplicative and multiple numerals declined and still decline in the same way as adjectives so they will not be discussed here.  One  Numeral jedinъ has preserved the mixed pronoun-adjectival declension.  Two - four  Five - ten  One hundred  For the declension of numerals a new and quite irregular pattern has been constructed, based on the dual number.  Eleven - nineteen  Twenty - ninety, two hundred - nine hundred  Combinations of words have been turned into compounds.  Collective numerals  The forms of collective numerals have been blended (portmanteau) : masculine genitive dъvoj-a or dъvoj-ego > dwoj(e)ga (two) = Dual number = Dual number has disappeared, only some endings have been preserved: oczy (eyes), uszy (ears), rękoma or rękami (with hands), also in vernacular dialects and in proverbs: \\"mądrej głowie dość dwie słowie, lepszy wróbel w ręku niż gołąb na sęku\\". (\\"Two words are enough for a smart head, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\\").  Conjugation  The distinction between stems of the present tense verbs and stems of the past tense verbs has been preserved. = Infinitive = The ending -i has disappeared (at first from endings *-cy < -ci): : by-ti > *byci > być (to be) : nes-ti > *nieści > nieść (to carry) : dvigną-ti > *dźwignęci > dźwignąć (to lift) = Present tense = It has undergone just slight changes: : nes-ą > niosę (I am carrying) : rek-ą > *rzekę > rzeczę (I am saying), exception: tłukę (I am smashing) : rec-i > *rzec(y) > rzeknij ? (you say), exception: tłucz (you smash) : nes-e-mъ > *niesiem > niesiemy (we are carrying) Many verbs have changed their present tense forms: : żywię – żywiesz > żyję – żyjesz (I am alive / I live – you are alive / you live) : grzebę – grzebiesz > grzebię – grzebiesz (I am digging / I dig – you are digging / you dig) : kolę – kolesz > kłuję – kłujesz (I am stinging / I sting – you are stinging / you sting) : porzę – porzesz > pruję – prujesz (I am unstitching / I unstitch – you are unstitching / you unstitch) : rostę – rościesz > rosnę – rośniesz (I am growing / I grow – you are growing / you grow) : kradę – kradziesz > kradnę – kradniesz (I am stealing / I steal – you are stealing / you steal) : łupam – łupasz > łupię – łupiesz (I am splitting / I split – you are splitting / you split) : kłamam – kłamasz > kłamię – kłamiesz (I am lying / I lie – you are lying / you lie) Instead of -ętъ for athematic verbs or for verbs with stems ending in -i-, the form -jątъ is used: : dus-ętъ > *dusią(t) > duszą (they are strangling/they strangle) : dad-ętъ > *dadzią(t) > dadzą (they will give)  Conjugation -am,-asz  Based on the conjugation of athematic verbs, the new conjugation -am, -asz has been introduced (very rarely -em, -esz): : gra-je-šь > *gra-je-sz > *gr-a:-sz > grasz (you play) : gra-je-tъ > *gra-je-0 > *gr-a:-0 > gra (he/she/it plays) : gra-je-mъ > *gra-je-my > *gr-a:-my > gramy (we play) : gra-je-te > *gra-je- cie > *gr-a:-cie > gracie (you-plural play) By analogy to dam (I will give) - dasz (you will give): : gra-ją > gra-j-ę (until 14th – 15th century) > gram (I play) in general (compare with dadzą) (they will give): : gra-ją-tъ > grają (they play) = Past tenses = Aorist - a past perfective tense, used to mark an action that happened only once and was fully accomplished in the past. Initially, it was used with both perfective and imperfective verbs. Out of the three types of aorist: asygmatic, sygmatic I and sygmatic II, only the sygmatic I was used in the Polish language. It was used with verbs which stems in the infinitive ended in a vowel. Imperfect - was used to mark an action that took place or was repeated in the past. It was used with imperfective verbs. Aorist and Imperfect merged and then disappeared. The ending characteristic of the aorist has remained present in some dialects: byłech, byłek (=byłem) (I was) The past imperfective tense has become a past simple tense bylъ jes-mь > byłem. (I was) The pluperfect is currently disappearing. = Future tense = The present forms of perfective verbs have retained their future meaning. The future tense of imperfective verbs is still constructed by combining a conjugated form of będę with an infinitive or a past participle: będę chwalić or będę chwalił. (I will be praising). = Conditional = The Protoslavic form of a conditional was replaced by the aorist (Old Polish bych), which then underwent some changes due to the influence of past tense endings. = Participles = * The present tense active participle has come to be declined in the same way as adjectives. The present tense adverbial participle has also been introduced: gotujący, gotując (cooking). * The traces of the present tense passive participle have remained in forms such as świadomy (aware of), rzekoma (alleged). * The type I past tense active participle has remained in the form of the past tense adverbial participle: ugotowawszy (having cooked), kopnąwszy (having kicked), obdarłszy (having stripped). * The type II past tense active participle has become the base for the construction of the past tense (gotowałem) (I was cooking) and also the future complex tense (będę gotował) (I will be cooking). It is still used with some intransitive verbs (zgniły, zmokły) (rotten, soaked). * The past tense passive participle has remained animate: bity (bitten), poznana (met), wiedzione (led). = Dual number = Dual number survived until 14th - 15th century with some slight changes: : first person -vě > *-wie > -wa (due to the influence of the first person masculine dual: dwa konja) (two horses). : second person -ta > -ta : third person -te > *-cie > -ta (became the same as the second person to be differentiated from the second person plural) In the 16th century dual number disappeared from the literary language. It has been preserved in a number of dialects but the meaning of words in the dual number is equal to their blending in plural. The first person ending -ma is sometimes used as a result of merging -wa with -my. chodźwa, chodźma (=chodźmy) (/we/let's go). Only in the region of Tarnobrzeg does the distinction still exist for niesiewa, nieśwa (dual number) and niesiemy, nieśmy (plural) (we carry, let's carry).

Life Hans Lorbeer was born as the illegitimate child of a worker girl in Lutherstadt Wittenberg in the Province of Saxony and grew up with foster parents in Kleinwittenberg and Piesteritz, both districts of Lutherstadt Wittenberg. After a non-self contained vocational training as a plumber, he was a laborer at different chemical laboratories in and around Wittenberg. He would become a member of the Freien deutsche Jugend (Free German Youth) in 1918, then the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1921 and then a co-founder of the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors in 1928. He wrote for the KPD newspaper Klassenkampf (Class Struggle) in Halle and Die Rote Fahne after 1927. He was sacked from the Nitrogen factory in Piesteritz for political agitation and remained jobless until 1933. His exclusion from the KPD in 1931 because of violation of party lines that would be annulled in 1945. In 1932 he joined the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition). Because of anti-fascist resistance and contacts to the group Weise, he would be in a concentration camp in 1933 and 1934, then the Zuchthaus and Emslandlager, after which he was a laborer under Gestapo supervision. From 8 May 1945 until 31 July 1950 Lorbeer was mayor of Piesteritz and then a freelance writer until his death. Hans Lorbeer was a member of the Akademie der Künste. For his literary works, he was awarded the 1959 Heinrich Mann Prize, the 1961 National Prize of East Germany, the 1963 Mündel Prize of the Halle Bezirk and the 1971 Lion Feuchtwanger Prize, as well as the gold Patriotic Order of Merit and the Order of the Banner of Labor. On 8 August 1976 the city government of Lutherstadt Wittenberg agreed that Hans Lorbeer would be named an honorary citizen of the City. On the basis of the then legally valid position, he is viewed as the last Honorary Citizen of that city. Works A representative selection of Lorbeer's poetic writings offered in the volume Chronik in Versen. Gedichte aus fünf Jahrzehnten had appeared in the 1971 Mitteldeutschen Verlag as a piece of Lorbeer's Gesammelten Werken in Einzelausgaben.

It was written by one of the season's executive producers, Robert Carlock, and one of the season's co-executive producers, Jack Burditt. The episode was directed by one of the season's producers, Don Scardino. The episode first aired on May 1, 2008 on the NBC network in the United States. Guest stars in this episode included Bill Cwikowski, Brian Dennehy, Marceline Hugot, Johnnie May, Jason Sudeikis, Miriam Tolan and Rip Torn. The episode earned Tina Fey the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Unusually this episode begins on the 30 Rock title sequence - there is no cold open as is normally the case. This episode begins on the annual TGS with Tracy Jordan (a fictional sketch comedy series) Sandwich Day. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) receives a phone call from her ex-boyfriend, Floyd (Jason Sudeikis), asking for a place to stay; Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and the TGS writers try to get a new sandwich for Liz; Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) reconsiders his future at General Electric. Plot It is the annual Sandwich Day for the crew of TGS. The Teamsters, led by Mickey J. (Brian Dennehy), bring in \\"secret\\" sandwiches from an unknown Italian delicatessen in Brooklyn. When the writers eat Liz's sandwich, Liz threatens that she will \\"cut [their] faces up so bad [...] [they'll] all have chins.\\" As a result, the writers and Tracy, aided by Jenna, enter a drinking contest against the Teamsters in an attempt to get Liz a new sandwich. Floyd, who broke up with Liz in the episode \\"Hiatus\\", calls Liz to ask if he can have a place to stay, as he has come to visit New York City on business. Liz tries to win Floyd back, only for him to lie to her about going home to Cleveland, Ohio. Floyd eventually travels home, and the pair agree to remain friends. Meanwhile, after being ousted from his office on the 52nd floor by Devon Banks (Will Arnett), Jack is not taking well to his new job on the 12th floor. He later decides to move to Washington, D.C., to be the new \\"Homeland Security Director for Crisis and Weather Management.\\" Production This episode was primarily filmed on April 1, 2008. Save Picture as → Right click file → Properties → Summary → Advanced → Date Picture Taken This episode was the fourth episode written by Jack Burditt and the seventh written by Robert Carlock. The episode was the twelfth episode which was directed by Don Scardino. Jason Sudeikis, who played Floyd in this episode, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live, a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey was the head writer on Saturday Night Live from 1999 until 2006. Various other cast members of Saturday Night Live have appeared on 30 Rock, including Rachel Dratch, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Will Forte, Jimmy Fallon, Amy Poehler, Will Ferrell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bill Hader, Tim Meadows, Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell and Molly Shannon. Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of Saturday Night Live. Alec Baldwin has also hosted Saturday Night Live sixteen times, the highest number of episodes of any host of the series. This was actress Johnnie May's second appearance in 30 Rock. She previously appeared in the episode \\"Tracy Does Conan\\" as a nurse who takes Liz's blood for donation. In this episode she plays a screener who would not allow Liz past airport security because she had her Sandwich Day sandwich with her, and its dipping sauce container held \\"more than 3 ounces.\\" Reception \\"Sandwich Day\\" brought in an average of 5.4 million viewers. The episode also achieved a 2.6/7 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The 2.6 refers to 2.6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S., and the 7 refers to 7% of all 18- to 49-year- olds watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode \\"turned out to be an absolute winner\\".

Their son is actor Julian McMahon. Early life and education Sonia Rachel Hopkins was born at 'Borambil', Redmyre Road, Strathfield, New South Wales. She was the daughter of William Edward Hopkins and Rachel May Lilla, daughter of grazier William G. Matchett, one of Australia's wealthiest men.Profile, news.google.com; accessed 15 September 2015. His estate was valued at over £580,000 gross after his death in 1932, the year Sonia was born. Career and marriage to William McMahon Sonia Hopkins worked as an occupational therapist until 1965 when she married William (better known as Billy) McMahon, an aspiring politician in Sir Robert Menzies' government. She was 32, he 57. It was the only marriage for both. He became Prime Minister in 1971.https://primeministers.moadoph.gov.au/prime- ministers/billy-mcmahon Later that year, Sonia McMahon made world headlines after being photographed at the White House wearing a revealing dress in the company of her husband and United States president Richard Nixon. The white full-length dress featured see-through slits down both sides. The Washington Post described the dress as one of the most talked about items of clothing ever to be worn to the White House. In later years (then Lady McMahon) she spoke to her biographer, commenting that her husband chose the dress and that it had \\"certainly made an impact\\".Obituary, dailytelegraph.com.au; accessed 15 September 2015. Their first two children (Melinda and Julian) were born before he became prime minister. Their third child, Deborah, was born in 1972, during McMahon's term as prime minister. As a prime ministerial spouse from March 1971 to December 1972, Sonia McMahon organised for a nanny to look after the children at the family home in the Sydney suburb of Bellevue Hill, while she lived with her husband at The Lodge, Canberra, attending official duties. In an interview with her biographer, Sonia McMahon said: \\"It was a hard decision. I loved being with Bill and I loved being a mum. But I knew I had to make a decision, and I chose to be with my husband.\\" William McMahon was knighted in 1977, and she became Lady McMahon, although often still referred to as simply Sonia McMahon. She became a widow in 1988, and in the ensuing years she continued her philanthropic activities. Lady McMahon became a board member and patron of many charities, including the National Brain Foundation, the Sydney Children's Hospital Foundation, the Australian Cancer Research Foundation, the Microsearch Foundation and Australia's Sudden Infant Death Syndrome association. Death and legacy On 22 February 2009, Lady McMahon was seriously injured after slipping on the stairs of a luxury pleasure boat owned by her friend, Paul Ramsay. She was taken to St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney suffering broken ribs, punctured lung, and multiple other bone fractures. She was admitted to intensive care in March 2010 to undergo a procedure to clear her lungs of fluid. While in hospital, Lady McMahon had been preparing for an appearance at the Golden Slipper horse racing event at Rosehill Gardens Racecourse on 2 April. Lady McMahon died aged 77 on 2 April 2010, in Sydney's St Vincent's Private Hospital after suffering from cancer; her three children were by her side. Tributes emerged from throughout the country from the Sydney social scene and from each side of the Australian political divide. Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott said, \\"She added grace and colour to our national life. We will all miss her. Our hearts go out to her family on this sad day\\". Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described Lady McMahon as a \\"distinguished representative of Australia ... this is a day of great sadness\\".Obituary, smh.com.au; accessed 15 September 2015. Media outlets noted her work in contributing to the community by attending fundraisers for charity and different organisations including being on the board of the Sydney Children's Hospital as well as for her complete loyalty to her husband.

Genus and common name come from Neptune, god of the sea, in reference to the aquatic habit of some species in the genus. Its specific epithet oleracea means \\"vegetable/herbal\\" in Latin and is a form of (). Description Aerenchyma (white spongy air-conducting tissue that gives stems buoyancy) forms on stems floating in water, but does not form on stems growing on land. Plants typically grow to as much as 6\\" tall, but stems will spread in the water to 3-5' long. Stems are clad with bi-pinnate, fine, mimosa-like sensitive leaves that close up when touched. Primary leaf segments have 8-40 small oblong leaflets arranged in opposite pairs. Tiny greenish-yellow flowers are densely crowded into feathery orbicular inflorescences that bloom in summer. Fruits are flat pods (to 1-2\\" long). Floating aquatic plant stems often form thick foliage mats and is considered to be an invasive aquatic weed in some tropical waters where large mats may form that choke waterways, resulting in restricted water flow, reduced water quality, reduced fish activity and loss of some underwater and native wetland plants. Habitat Primarily found growing prostrate in wet soils near the water's edge or floating on the water in relatively still-water areas. The native habitat of Neptunia oleracea is unknown, but some experts believe it is in the area of Mexico to northern South America.  Uses  Yam phak krachet, a Thai salad made with water mimosa  Culinary  This plant is cultivated as a vegetable in southeast Asia (leaves and shoots have cabbage-like flavor). Young ends of stems and pods are edible and usually eaten raw as a vegetable in Thailand and Cambodia and cultivated much like rice.

It was established on 3 September 1944 by Houphouët-Boigny and the colonial administration. History Felix Houphouët-Boigny The SAA was established on 3 September 1944 by Houphouët-Boigny and the colonial administration at an inaugural meeting in Abidjan.Ellenbogen, pp. 26–31. Under his presidency, it brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their paychecks and worked to protect their interests against those of European settlers. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labour. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers. Its success irritated the colonists to the extent that they took legal action against Houphouët. However, the SAA increased his popularity as the voice of the Africans. When elected to the assemblée constituante on 4 November 1945, Houphouët-Boigny worked to implement the wishes of the SAA. He proposed a bill to abolish forced labour, the single most unpopular feature of French rule, on 1 March 1946 which the Assembly adopted in 1947. On 9 April 1946,Toubabou, p. 60. Houphouët-Boigny, with the help of the Groupes d'études communistes d'Abidjan, recreated the SAA as the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire (PDCI), the first effective party in Côte d'Ivoire and the Ivorian section of the African Democratic Rally.

It is currently a derelict building that is crumbling down. It is forbidden for safety reasons to access the bull ring. When in operation it could host 10,000 spectators. It is designed in typically Moorish style. It officially opened on January 9, 1910, featuring the most famous Bullfighters of the time, Ricardo Torres ( Bombita Grande) and his brother Manuel (a.k.a. Bombita Chico) from Spain. Although originally scheduled to open on January 8, the opening was postponed as the owners feared they did not have the necessary comforts and services required for the event. Due to public uproar, mainly from Buenos Aires, they yielded to public demand and opened the following day to no less than 7,000 spectators. The arena hosted a total of eight fights before bull fighting was prohibited by the Uruguayan national government in 1912. The bull ring was part of a tourist complex including a jai alai court, a hotel, and racecourse. Currently only the racecourse is still in operation.

Biography=Career Benny Bartlett was a child prodigy on the piano at eight years of age. His first stage role was when he was ten days old. At age four he was playing the trumpet, directing and singing with his own dance orchestra. He played over radio. He appeared in an RKO musical, Millions in the Air (1935), playing the piano. The next year he appeared in a short for Paramount, performing a composition he had written at the age of nine. The studio signed him to a contract soon afterwards. Bartlett began appearing with many of Paramount's biggest stars, and became such a hot property that he was often loaned out to other studios. Later career and personal life By the early 1940s, with the onset of puberty, he had reached the awkward age where child actors couldn't play juveniles anymore. Bartlett joined the military during World War II. After his enlistment was over he resumed his acting career, and was cast as a member of the gang in The Bowery Boys comedies. He exited the series in 1955, and shortly afterwards left the film business entirely.

Wholesale funding sources include, but are not limited to, Federal funds, public funds (such as state and local municipalities), U.S. Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the U.S. Federal Reserve's primary credit program, foreign deposits, brokered deposits, and deposits obtained through the Internet or CD listing services. Rationale Although core deposits continue to be a key liability funding source, many insured depository institutions have experienced difficulty attracting core deposits and are increasingly looking to wholesale funding sources to satisfy funding and liability management needs. Liquidity risk Wholesale funding providers are generally sensitive to changes in the credit risk profile of the institutions to which they provide these funds and to the interest rate environment. For instance, such providers closely track the institution's financial condition and may be likely to curtail such funding if other investment opportunities offer more attractive interest rates. As a result, an institution may experience liquidity problems due to lack of wholesale funding availability when needed. Academic research suggests that the use of wholesale funding was one of the major determinants of bank vulnerability during the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Theater career Carstensen, the daughter of a physician, was born and raised in the north-German city of Kiel. Upon graduation from the local high school in 1958, she studied acting at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. This education led to her first stage appearances in Kleve, Heilbronn, Münster and Braunschweig. In 1965 Margit Carstensen received a four-year engagement with the Deutsches Schauspielhaus (German Playhouse) in Hamburg. There she played leading roles in plays by John Osborne and the classical Spanish playwright Lope de Vega. In 1969 she gained a local profile for her work in the Theater am Goetheplatz in Bremen, where she first met director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. She then worked under his direction in a comedy by the 18th-century Venetian Carlo Goldoni The Coffee Shop (which was recorded for television in 1970), bringing her national attention in West Germany. She subsequently played the role of serial murderess Geesche Gottfried in the premiere of Fassbinder’s own play Bremen Freedom (also televised, in 1972), and then in the title role of his Henrik Ibsen adaptation Nora Helmer (televised in 1974) derived from A Doll's House. From 1973 to 1976 Carstensen held a steady acting engagement in Darmstadt, and the next year worked once again in Hamburg. In 1977 she moved to what was then West Berlin where she performed on the highly regarded Staatliche Schauspielbühnen. In 1982 she moved to Stuttgart in order to work with director Hansgünther Heyme, where she appeared in a series of plays directed by him. Over the years she also performed in many smaller roles on the most important of the German-language stages, for example making several appearances in the Munich Kammerspiele. By the late 1980s she had developed ongoing working relationships with the German directors Werner Schroeter, Christoph Schlingensief and Leander Haußmann. In 1995 she followed Haußmann to Bochum, in order to work with him there. For the 2003-04 season, Carstensen appeared in the Vienna Burgtheater, in the premiere of Elfriede Jelinek’s play Bambiland under the direction of Schlingensief. In 2008 she appeared in the Schauspielhaus Bochum (Playhouse Bochum), in Shakespeare's As You Like It. Film and television Carstensen is best known outside Germany for the many film and television productions of Rainer Werner Fassbinder in which she participated. She played leading roles in the Fassbinder films The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972), her best-known role for Fassbinder; Martha (1974), with Karlheinz Böhm, analysing a traditional marriage in a contemporary setting; ' (1975); Mother Küsters' Trip to Heaven (1975); Satan's Brew (1976); Chinese Roulette (1976) and Women in New York (1977). She also appeared in individual episodes of two Fassbinder television productions: Eight Hours Don't Make a Day (1972), and Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980). Carstensen also worked in international productions. In the fifth film made by Polish director Andrzej Żuławski, Possession (1981), a French-German coproduction, she performed together with Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill and Heinz Bennent. Four years later she worked with Polish-born director Agnieszka Holland on her film Angry Harvest (1985), together with Armin Mueller-Stahl. This film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Her artistic collaboration with director Christoph Schlingensief began with two of his film projects. In his Adolf Hitler - A Hundred Years: The Last Hours in the Führer’s Bunker (1989), she played the part of Magda Goebbels. In his satirical political spoof Terror 2000: Intensive Care Germany (1992), she played the role of a detective. Carstensen has appeared in films by directors such as Leander Haußmann (Sonnenallee, 1999); Romuald Karmakar (Manila, 2000); Chris Kraus (Scherbentanz, 2002, a role for which she won the Bavarian Film Award for Best Actress); Oskar Roehler (Agnes and His Brothers, 2004) and Detlev Buck (Hands off Mississippi, 2007).

It was known as the New Railway Pier until renamed Prince's Pier after the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) who visited Melbourne in May 1920. History Remains of the original wooden pillars forming the pier The pier was constructed between 1912 and 1915 by the Melbourne Harbour Trust to supplement the adjacent Station Pier (originally the 'Railway Pier'). From completion in 1915 until 1969 it was also a major arrival point for new migrants, particularly during the post-war period. In addition to a pier, there was a gatehouse and barriers, terminal building, amenities rooms, goods lockers, ablution blocks, railway sidings and passenger gangways. From opening the pier was linked by rail to the Port Melbourne railway line, via double lines branching from the Melbourne side of Graham station. Eight railway tracks ran onto the bridge, four along either face.Victorian Railways signal diagram A passenger rail service was provided to the pier from 30 May 1921 operated by suburban electric trains. Provided when ships were docked at the pier, it was usually operated by a single double ended 'swing door' motor car until ended in November 1930, as it was not financially rewarding to the Victorian Railways. The overhead wiring was removed on 17 August 1953 and the line singled and worked as a siding from 21 March 1961. With the containerisation boom the pier became unused, being closed to public access in the early 1990s due to the poor timber condition, and squatters caused a fire in the late 1990s that destroyed the store structures. In the three years to 2004, 14 fires occurred. A refurbishment estimated to cost $14 million was announced by the State Government in April 2006, with the first 196 metres of the Pier fully restored, beyond that point the decking being removed and the original pylons preserved. A full restoration was estimated at $60 million. A contract for the work was awarded in June 2007, and work began in October of the same year. The pier reopened to the public in December 2011.

The Japanese forces, mainly from the Imperial Japanese Army, were guarding an airfield at Munda Point on the western coast of the island that the U.S. wished to capture as one of the key objectives of the New Georgia campaign. After landing around Zanana on 2 July from Rendova, U.S. troops began a westward advance towards the airfield at Munda. Held up by difficult terrain and stubborn Japanese defense, elements of three U.S. regiments advanced slowly along the Munda trail over the course of two weeks. The slow progress resulted in a reorganization of the U.S. forces assigned to the drive, and preparations were made for a corps-level offensive, but before this could be launched, the Japanese launched a counterattack on 17 July. Background Munda Point lies on the western coast of mainland New Georgia. To its northwest lies Bangaa Island and to its south lies Rendova, from which it is separated by the Blanche Channel and the Munda Bar.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 69 (map)Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 201 (map) At the time of the battle, the location's significance was derived from the airfield that the Japanese had established there. In the wake of the Guadalcanal campaign, concluded in early 1943, the Allies formulated plans to advance through the Central Solomons towards Bougainville, in conjunction with further operations in New Guinea, as part of the effort to reduce the main Japanese base around Rabaul under the guise of Operation Cartwheel. Capture of the airfield at Munda would facilitate further assaults on Vila, on Kolombangara, and Bougainville.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 73Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 52 For the Japanese, New Georgia formed a key part in their defenses along the southern approaches to Rabaul and they sought to defend the area strongly, moving reinforcements by barge along the Shortlands–Vila–Munda supply line.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, backcoverMorison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 180 350px The campaign plan for securing New Georgia, designated Operation Toenails by U.S. planners, involved several landings by elements of Major General Oscar Griswold's XIV Corps to secure staging areas and an airfield in the southern part of New Georgia at Wickham Anchorage, Viru Harbor and Rendova. These would then be garrisoned to support the movement of troops and supplies from Guadalcanal to Rendova, which would be built up as base for further operations in New Georgia focused on securing the airfield at Munda. Efforts by U.S. forces to secure a lodgment on the west coast of New Georgia began early on 30 June when two companies from the 169th Infantry Regiment were landed offshore from Zanana, to secure several islands that sat at the mouth of the Onaiavisi Entrance to Roviana Lagoon. After linking up with a small party of local guides and a reconnaissance force that had been sent ahead, these troops consolidated their position and then moved to the mainland to begin scouting the area around Zanana towards the Barike River, and also between the Japanese airfield at Munda Point and Bairoko Harbor. To support this effort, a company of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion had been scheduled to reinforce the 169th Infantry Regiment, but they were unable to be released from operations to secure Segi Point and Viru Harbor and in their stead a company of Fijian and Tongan troops from a New Zealand-trained commando unit was detailed to assist.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 90Larsen, Pacific Commandos, pp. 9 & 108 Battle On 2 July, after the landings on Rendova, a company from the 169th Infantry Regiment and the entire 1st Battalion, 172nd Infantry Regiment, began to move to the New Georgia mainland as part of efforts to secure Munda Point. Detached from Major General John H. Hester's 43rd Infantry Division, these troops formed part of the force designated as the Southern Landing Group under the command of the assistant division commander, Brigadier General Leonard F. Wing. After night time reconnaissance patrols proved unsuccessful, on the afternoon of 2 July, a daylight crossing was undertaken utilizing a force of twelve Landing Craft Infantry vessels and four Landing Craft Tank vessels. Guided by local scouts in canoes, and covered by three artillery battalions, the U.S. troops crossed the Blanche Channel before passing through Onaiavisi Entrance and into Roviana Lagoon and landing around Zanana, east of Munda. After establishing a perimeter at Zanana, and building up further artillery support—four U.S. Army artillery battalions and two Marine batteries—the remaining elements of both regiments began arriving around the beachhead in preparation for the advance westward. This concentration was completed by 6 July. Meanwhile, reconnaissance troops, including elements from the New Zealand-led 1st Company, South Pacific Scouts and coastwatchers began preliminary operations.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 92–94 Drive towards Munda Point 2–14 July 1943 Prior to the start of the New Georgia campaign, Allied intelligence had assessed that there were between 2,000 and 3,000 Japanese personnel in the Munda area. In reality there were 4,500 men defending Munda, of which 2,000 were Imperial Japanese Army personnel while the remainder were drawn from the Imperial Japanese Navy.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 20 Commanded by Colonel Genjiro Hirata, the Japanese forces defending Munda consisted of several battalions from the 229th Infantry Regiment as well as artillery, engineer, signals and medical support elements.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 97 These troops had been detached from Major General Minoru Sasaki's Southeast Detachment and from 13 July, the 229th was reinforced with 1,300 troops from the 13th Infantry Regiment, which moved from Bairoko via barge, where they had been relieved by the 2nd Battalion, 45th Infantry Regiment.Rottman, Japanese Army in World War II: The South Pacific and New Guinea, 1942–43, pp. 65–67Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 105 On 4 July, the U.S. troops undertook a preliminary move prior to beginning their advance, marching towards a line of departure along the Barike River about away.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 106 Meanwhile, on the northern coast of New Britain, a force of U.S. Marines and Army troops landed at Rice Anchorage in an effort to block the movement of Japanese reinforcements down the Munda trail.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, p. 52 The 172nd reached the river on 6 July, but the 169th, which had adopted the inland route, was held up by a company from the Japanese 229th Infantry Regiment, and did not reach the river until 8 July. The U.S. troops, under orders from Hester, began a general attack the following day, supported by 155 mm guns firing from Rendova. The terrain between the landing beach at Zanana and the objective at Munda Point was not conducive to a quick approach, and U.S. planners had failed to appreciate the difficulty the troops would have traversing the single, narrow track or through the dense jungle, which was crossed by fast flowing creeks and streams, and flanked by rocky ridges and deep ravines. The advancing U.S. troops found navigation difficult and were forced into a narrow front as the Japanese resistance mounted.Rottman, Japanese Army in World War II: The South Pacific and New Guinea, 1942–43, pp. 66–67 In an effort to breakthrough, on 9 July, Hester ordered the 172nd Infantry Regiment to carry out a flanking move to the north to attack the Japanese position in the rear, while the 169th Infantry Regiment continued its frontal assault; although the attack was supported by heavy artillery, naval gunfire support and air strikes,Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, p. 53 Sasaki correctly appreciated the U.S. commander's intent and responded quickly to the attack, moving troops to counter the flanking move, while in the forward areas movement was held up by Japanese snipers who concealed themselves in baskets in the trees and fired upon the U.S. troops with flashless rifles. That day, the 172nd gained about , while the 169th was unable to gain any ground at all. Troops from the 3rd Battalion, 103rd Infantry Regiment embarking on Rendova By 11 July, Hester decided to divert the 172nd Infantry Regiment to the south towards Laiana, while the 169th continued their advance up the Munda trail. On the evening of 11/12 July, a naval task force under Rear Admiral Aaron S. Merrill, having departed Ironbottom Sound in the afternoon, fired over 8,600 shells during a 40-minute bombardment from the Blanche Channel to clear the jungle in front of the advancing troops; this ultimately proved ineffective, being fired over a mile in front of the U.S. troops for safety reasons. The following day, the 172nd resumed their advance but made only limited progress.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 177–179 Allied efforts to interdict the Munda trail from the north proved unsuccessful,Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, pp. 52–53 and during this time the Japanese were able to land reinforcements from 16 barges that sailed from Vila; Japanese operations to move further reinforcements through the Slot on 12/13 July led to the naval Battle of Kolombangara. On 12 July, three battalions from the U.S. 169th Infantry Regiment carried out an attack against Japanese positions overlooking the junction of the Munda–Lambeti trail. The 1st and 2nd Battalions carried the attack initially, but were held up. The following day, the 3rd Battalion, 169th Infantry Regiment gained the south ridge—later dubbed \\"Reincke Ridge\\"—after several hours of fighting supported by dive bombers and artillery. A Japanese battalion found a gap in the line between the 169th and 172nd Infantry Regiments on 13 July, having resulted from the 172nd's diversion to Laiana, cutting off the American regiment around the high ground. They were then subjected to repeated counterattacks over the course of several days, resulting in over one hundred casualties on the first day alone.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 119Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 179, 198–199 The 172nd finally reached their objective at Laiana on 13 July, having found the going difficult to push through the swamp and coming under Japanese mortar fire. By the time they reached the beach, the regiment was running short of water and supplies. The following day, a second landing was carried out at Laiana, in an effort to shorten lines of supply and bring in reinforcements from the 3rd Battalion, 103rd Infantry Regiment, which linked up with the 172nd. The jeep trail from Zanana As part of efforts to break through to the cut-off 169th, the U.S. Army 118th Engineers, having previously pushed a track from Zanana, bridged the Barike River and ran a jeep trail towards the 169th's lines. Japanese troops harassed the bulldozer operators throughout this effort.Hammel, Munda Trail, p. 104Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 114, 118, 120 Stores were moved to the head of this trail by an antitank company, but by 14 July it was still short. To relieve the supply situation, the 169th received supplies by parachute on 14 July. The following day, a battalion of the 145th Infantry Regiment arrived at Zanana as reinforcements, detached from the 37th Infantry Division.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 120 The same day, the advancing U.S. troops reached the Japanese main defensive line, consisting of a line of pillboxes, bunkers and fighting positions, supported by light and heavy machine guns, mortars and mountain guns of varying calibers. By this time many of the Americans were suffering from dysentery. As instances of combat stress began to rise fire discipline declined.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 198 At this time, U.S. commanders made plans for a coordinated offensive to take Munda, and requested further reinforcements. The preparations would take time, though, which the Americans sought to buy with harassing fire from artillery and air strikes, coupled with minor advances aimed at securing some of the trails between Laiana and Zanana to relieve the 169th. Around this time, the troops advancing on Munda were reinforced by six United States Marine Corps tanks from the 9th Defense Battalion. These went in to action by 16 July. At least four tanks were damaged over two days of fighting after becoming isolated from their infantry support and coming under attack by Japanese infantry armed with magnetic mines.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 198–200Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 117–119 Aftermath The U.S. offensive made small gains because of the limited combat experience by its soldiers, poor leadership by inexperienced U.S. Army officers, harsh terrain and conditions on New Georgia, and effective defensive measures by the Japanese.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, pp. 53–54Rottman, Japanese Army in World War II: The South Pacific and New Guinea, 1942–43, p. 67 Casualties amongst the U.S. 43rd Division amounted to 90 men killed and 636 wounded; another 1,000 were evacuated due to illness. The U.S. soldiers experienced an unusually high number of severe cases of combat stress reaction. In analyzing the battle, historian Samuel Eliot Morison assessed that the choice of Zanana as a landing site had been a mistake and that Hester's decision to send the 172nd Infantry Regiment south, thereby exposing the 169th, had also been ill considered, writing: Author Mark Stille writes that the initial drive as resulting in \\"limited tactical progress\\" for the U.S. forces. To break the deadlock, the U.S. command structure on New Georgia was reorganized. After carrying out an inspection of the situation and reporting back to Admiral William Halsey on Guadalcanal, the U.S. corps commander, Griswold, arrived to take overall command in the field, assuming this role at midnight on 15 July. While Hester retained command of his division, the regimental commander of the 169th Infantry Regiment—Colonel John Eason—was relieved of his command, being replaced by Colonel Temple Holland of the 145th Infantry Regiment. One of the 169th's battalion commanders was also relieved.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, p. 54Hammel, Munda Trail, p. 107 Meanwhile, supplies and reinforcements from the 161st Infantry Regiment (detached from the 25th Infantry Division), as well as tanks from the 10th Defense Battalion, were dispatched from Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands in preparation for a corps-level offensive. Before this could begin, though, the Japanese launched a counterattack on 17 July using the reinforcements that had arrived from Vila, effectively bringing the Allied drive on Munda temporarily to a halt. After this effort was defeated, the Americans eventually secured the airfield in the Battle of Munda Point in early August.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 124, 137, 158–159Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, pp. 54–62Hammel, The Munda Trail, p. 123 NotesReferences   * * Further reading    – Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War.   * Category:Conflicts in 1943 Category:Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II Category:1943 in the Solomon Islands Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving the Solomon Islands Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan Category:Battles of World War II involving the United States Category:1943 in Japan Category:July 1943 events ","title":"Drive on Munda Point"},{"id":"18653198","text":"The Action of 16 March 1917 was a naval engagement in which the British armed boarding steamer and the armoured cruiser fought and sank the German auxiliary cruiser , which sank with all 319 hands and the six men of a British boarding party. Action Right elevation and plan view from Brassey's Naval Annual of the Warrior class; the shaded areas show armour. After leaving port in March disguised as the Norwegian freighter Rena Norge, Leopard (Captain Hans von Laffert) set sail on its mission to disrupt Allied commerce. On 17 March, the cruiser HMS Achilles stopped Leopard in the Atlantic, about midway between Iceland and Norway and ordered her to proceed to the boarding vessel Dundee (Captain Selwyn Day) for inspection. Out-gunned, Laffert had no option but to proceed to the boarding vessel. Day dispatched a launch containing a boarding party of an officer and five men to investigate the apparent merchant vessel. Laffert realised that he was about to be discovered, detained the party, and after about an hour fired two torpedoes at Dundee. Dundee manoeuvred out of the way just in time and the torpedoes missed by . Day ordered his gun crews to open fire and shells hit Leopard from the stern at such close range that every shot was a hit, smoke and steam rising from Leopard. Leopard turned to starboard but Dundee turned to port to avoid a broadside. By this time Leopard had been hit forty times. Achilles was to the east-north-east and opened fire on the raider about five minutes after Dundee had commenced firing. As Dundee avoided another broadside, Leopards gunners fired wild as she sailed straight for Achilles to avoid the fall of shot. Leopard continued to return fire for about an hour more, while shells from Achilless heavy guns caused explosions and jets of flame and smoke. Leopard began to sink but the crew continued to fire; at 4:30 p.m. Leopard sank with all 319 hands. Damage to the British vessels was light and the only casualties were the six members of the boarding party members on Leopard when it sank. FootnotesReferences  * Action of H. M.

The station's signal carried far and wide. In early 1967 Beaker Street was a staple for adherents to the burgeoning underground communities in the upper Mid-West especially in Des Moines, Iowa, where it was the only access to Dr. Demento and Firesign Theatre. Beaker Street began on Little Rock, Arkansas 50,000 watt AM radio station KAAY late in 1966 and ran through 1972. The show's original announcer, Clyde Clifford, moved to FM in 1974Koch, Stephen. \\"KAAY: The Mighty 1090 Gave Arkansas to North America\\", Arkansas Business 21 (8):S98, 2004-03-15.(Archive) as the rise in popularity of FM radio began to impact the operations of many AM stations. Beaker Street pre-dated the FM radio boom of the mid-1970s and foretold the rise of album-oriented Rock and Classic rock formats. History Dale Seidenschwarz, aka Clyde Clifford, was the prototype of the laid-back late-night radio DJ, known for the very long pauses in his speech.Tarter, Steve. \\"On the air: Tune into unexpected AM find in the p.m.\\", Peoria Journal Star, 2007-04-22, p. C4. The stage name of Clyde Clifford continued a tradition at KAAY whereby the on-air personalities often fashioned a stage name from the names of the board of directors of LIN Broadcasting, the owners of KAAY. Clyde W. Clifford was the comptroller general of LIN Broadcasting. Among the more memorable details of this radio program were the interludes of eerie sound effects and a background of space music between songs. These background sounds were necessary to mask the noise of the transmitter since the program originated at KAAY's transmitter location in Wrightsville, AR rather than in the station's broadcast studios in downtown Little Rock. Broadcasting from the transmitter site allowed a single employee, Clifford, to serve in the dual capacity of overnight broadcast engineer and as announcer. The original background music, composed by Henry Mancini, came from the dream sequence in the movie Charade. In the early 1970s, the background music was changed to sounds from \\"Cannabis Sativa\\" by a band called Head. This background is still in use today as a trademark of Beaker Street, although the need to mask transmitter sounds ended when the show left KAAY. The name of the show reflected the era in which it was created. Beaker Street was an oblique reference to LSD. The program featured Acid rock and its name alluded to the fact that \\"Acid\\" ( i.e., LSD ) was created in a laboratory beaker. The station tried to be as mysterious as possible, at one time even running a contest for listeners to try to guess how to spell Beaker, suggesting that it was spelled in some unconventional fashion. Although Clyde Clifford (Dale Seidenschwarz) originated the concept of Beaker Street, the show continued for some years after Clifford left KAAY in 1974. Several Beaker Street hosts used the on-air name of Ken Knight, followed by Stuart McRae in the mid-1970s. Stuart McRae expanded the show from the original three hours to a full five and a half hours (11:00 PM to 4:30 AM). In early 1977, a new program director at KAAY decided to end Beaker Street, viewing it as inconsistent with other programming. McRae resigned over this decision, and the last regular Beaker Street shows were handled by Don Payne. Despite the show's demise on KAAY, Beaker Street remained a fond memory for many fans. When KAAY was sold and converted from a rock music to a religious format in 1985, Clyde Clifford was invited back to handle the final hours of rock music programming on March 3, 1985. At the conclusion of this melancholy and somewhat emotional program, believed by many listeners to be the last Beaker Street, the final song played by Clifford was 'The Circle Game' by Joni Mitchell. Years later, Clyde Clifford and Beaker Street returned to the airwaves every Sunday night from 7 p.m. until midnight Central Time, first on KZLR (KZ-95) and later on Magic 105.1 FM KMJX. During that time the show was also streamed live via the internet, from the Beaker street homepage. As a result of a change in station programming format, the final Beaker Street on Magic 105 was broadcast February 17, 2008. Beaker Street begin broadcasting from its new home at The Point 94.1 FM on Sunday March 9, 2008, continuing to occupy the 7:00pm- midnight time slot on Sunday evenings. Ironically, the studio of The Point 94.1 FM is located in the same building (2400 Cottondale Lane in Little Rock, Arkansas) where Clyde Clifford broadcast the last hours of rock music programming on KAAY twenty-three years earlier. The last song of the new Beaker Street was, appropriately, the last song from KAAY, \\"The Circle Game\\" by Joni Mitchell. Jaime Brockett's \\"The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic\\" was also played in the third hour of the final show on the Point on February 6, 2011. Clyde Clifford currently DJ's Beaker Street on friday nights from 9pm until 12am US central time on the Arkansas Rocks network of radio stations. Significance of Beaker Street The strong nighttime signal of 50,000 watt, clear channel KAAY meant that it was possible to regularly listen to the station's nighttime programming in a wide area of the midwest and south. KAAY's late-night \\"footprint\\" gained fans as far west as Wyoming and Montana, north to the Dakotas and Manitoba and south as far as New Orleans and into Florida. This strong broadcast signal enabled Beaker Street to deliver the music of the late 1960s counterculture to many smaller cities and towns in America, where such music could not otherwise be heard over the air waves. Beaker Street attracted a legion of fans across the Midwest with its pioneering format, which featured long album cuts from rock artists who otherwise would not get commercial radio airplay outside of large cities with freeform or progressive rock stations. One example of the impact of Beaker Street can be seen in the evolution and success of the band Headstone, formed in 1969 by five students at the University of Northern Iowa. The band released a 45-rpm record \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\" which attracted the attention of Clyde Clifford and was placed in regular rotation on Beaker Street. Headstone co-founder Tom Tatman characterized Beaker Street as \\"the ultimate Midwestern underground radio program of the day.\\" The popularity generated by the Beaker Street exposure allowed the band to move to bigger and better performances, and in August 2006, the band was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Heinselman, Karen. \\"Cedar Falls Band to be Inducted into Iowa Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\\", Waterloo Courier 2006-08-26. For fans of Beaker Street, many album cuts became favorites over the years, including songs which were generally not available on either 45-rpm records or LP albums. One such performance was a melancholy rendition of a Tom Paxton song, Cindy's Cryin, performed by the Little Rock band Deepwater Reunion with vocalist Barbara Raney. Original records or tapes of this performance are rare, but a similar version of Cindy's Cryin has been performed by talented fans of the music, fans who first heard the song on Beaker Street. Another rarely heard recording played on Beaker Street was the Jaime Brockett cover of an old Leadbelly song, which he called \\"The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic\\"; a rambling 13-minute Titanic opus, recorded in 1969, which has the ship's captain smoking a hemp cigarette with the first mate minutes before the ship hits the iceberg. Radio theater also made a comeback on Beaker Street, in half-hour or hour-long segments called Beaker Theatre; sometimes utilizing serious (and occasionally not-so serious) re-workings of old radio serial scripts, voiced by the Beaker Players; sometime playing the recordings of the comedy group Firesign Theatre, especially the \\"Nick Danger - Third Eye\\" series of skits. During the run of Beaker Street, the Firesign Theatre actually made several live appearances on the show. '''  Beaker Street in Cuba  ''' The KAAY nighttime signal was so strong that young people in Havana City and in other places in Cuba were able to receive it clearly. In the late 1970s, music sung in English was restricted by the Communist Government. Cuban radio stations were allowed to devote only about 20% of their time broadcasting music sung in English, so many young people used to listen to American radio stations as a response to that limitation, and the KAAY was one of the most popular. Today young people from those years still remember the DJ announcing \\"Beaker Street... an underground music service from KAAY, Little Rock, Arkansas...\\"El Nuevo Herald, ALEJANDRO RIOS: Contracultura Sep. 12, 2009.(Spanish) The author of the lines about Beaker Street in Cuba was one of those young Cubans who used to listen this famous radio station.

The network maintains a large programming emphasis on films (those primarily sourced from the library of partial owner Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), but also airs other limited general entertainment content in the form of classic television series and children's programming. The network – which broadcasts 24 hours a day in 480i standard definition – is available in many media markets via broadcast television stations, primarily on their digital subchannels, and on select cable providers through carriage of a local affiliate (primarily on digital tiers). This TV's programming and business operations are headquartered at 303 East Wacker Drive in Chicago; MGM handles advertising sales for the network through its offices in New York City. History Film and television studio Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer and Chicago, Illinois-based television station owner Weigel Broadcasting announced the formation of This TV on July 28, 2008, with a launch planned for that autumn. The \\"This TV\\" name was chosen as a branding and marketing avenue for the network and its stations, with slogans such as \\"This is the Place for Movies\\", \\"It Doesn't Get Any Better than This\\", \\"This is What You're Watching\\", \\"Stay Here for This\\" and \\"This is the Channel!\\" proposed for use in on-air promotions. This TV formally launched at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 1, 2008, with the 1986 Spike Lee film She's Gotta Have It as the network's first program. However, some initial affiliates may have \\"soft launched\\" the network one day earlier – on October 31, 2008 – to carry some Halloween-themed programming that was provided by the network. At launch, in addition to featuring content sourced largely from the MGM film and television library, Cookie Jar Entertainment provided children's programming for This TV's daily morning schedule. Under Weigel Broadcasting part- ownership, the network's operations were overseen by Neal Sabin, who in his role as Weigel's executive vice president oversaw the national launch of MeTV, a classic television network similar in format to This TV though with an almost exclusive focus on comedic and dramatic series. Jim Marketti, president/CEO of Marketti Creative Group, was hired in August 2008 as This TV's creative director, focusing on the network's marketing and promotion. On May 13, 2013, Weigel Broadcasting announced that it would be leaving the This TV partnership in order to focus on Movies!, a similar film-oriented multicast network that Weigel launched in partnership with Fox Television Stations in January 2013. Tribune Broadcasting, owners of the classic television multicast network Antenna TV, took over daily operations of This TV on November 1, 2013; concurrently, the network moved its affiliation in Chicago from the fifth digital subchannel of Weigel flagship station WCIU-TV (channel 26) to a newly created third subchannel of Tribune's television flagship WGN-TV (channel 9). On May 2, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its KidsClick children's programming block that would air on This TV starting on July 1, 2017. KidsClick left This TV on July 1, 2018. Programming This TV's program schedule relies primarily on the library of films and television programming currently owned by MGM and subsidiary United Artists. No originally produced programming appears on the network, although the use of on-air presenters had once been considered for This TV's movie broadcasts; the network is also devoid of infomercial programming. However, the network does display an on- screen logo bug during its programs, and affiliates are inclined to include regional descriptors reflecting the station's primary broadcast area or the station's own logo underneath the network bug. The network did not utilize a split-screen credit sequence to promote upcoming programs during the closing credits until Tribune took over operations (these appear in the style used by many of Tribune's television stations and co-owned WGN America, with a varying number of network promos appearing on the top left of the screen on films that feature the credits running at normal or accelerated speed, framed by a text/background only graphic referencing the next program or promoting the network's website or social media accounts). Films broadcast on the network do feature commercial interruption, and breaks during its programming primarily consist of direct-response advertisements for products featured in infomercials and, particularly during This TV's children's programming, public service announcements. The network's first continuity announcer was Milwaukee radio personality and Miller Park PA system announcer Robb Edwards, who was replaced later in the Weigel era by Jim Cummings; Andy Geller, the primary promo voice of ABC through the 2000s, took over when Tribune assumed partial ownership of This TV. Movies This TV's daily schedule consists largely of feature films, which air on Monday through Saturdays from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., and Sundays from 6:00 to 10:00 a.m., 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 to 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time (sometimes starting earlier or ending later depending on the length of the films). The film roster does not concentrate on films from any specific era (although the network's film slate primarily focuses on releases made after 1960), meaning any film from the Depression era to contemporary times, and films made for either television, home video/DVD or theatrical release can be featured. The network's film telecasts usually, by far, are \\"television\\" cuts meant for broadcast syndication which feature content edits, dubbing or muting of profanities (including some that may otherwise be permissible on broadcast television) and some time edits by removing superfluous plotting or adult scenes toned down to fit within a two-hour timeslot with commercials. The use of the \\"television\\" cut means that most of the network's films are also presented in a pan and scan format suitable for 4:3 television sets; however since Tribune became part-owner of the network in November 2013, This TV has carried 16:9 syndication cuts of a limited number of titles – mainly those originally released after 2000 – that are downconverted to a letterboxed format to fit the network's native aspect ratio, as is also done with the KidsClick block. Films featured on This TV consist of releases from network co-parent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and its subsidiaries United Artists (post-1952 films) and The Samuel Goldwyn Company (pre-1997 films), as well as films produced by now-defunct film studios Orion Pictures (post-1981 films and its Orion Classics division), Cannon Group (except for those co-produced with Warner Bros.), American International Pictures, and the Mirisch Company (all of which were acquired by MGM); in addition, the pre-1996 library of films previously held by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment are also featured on the network. This also shows films from Miramax as well. Under Weigel co-ownership, This TV aired Pink Panther cartoon shorts to pad out surplus airtime when a film concludes more than five minutes prior to the end of the film's allotted timeslot. =Film blocks= This TV also commonly features themed movie presentations, with the entire day's schedule consisting of films from a particular genre once a week throughout the month (such as Mondays, which feature drama and romance films under the theme \\"From the Heart;\\" and Wednesdays, which feature action and western films under the theme \\"Wednesdays Are Wild\\"). On certain days, the network may air differing genres of films separated by daypart (for example, crime dramas during the day and comedies at night). The network also broadcasts a featured movie in primetime at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday through Friday nights. Until October 31, 2013, the weeknight prime movie presentations were typically replayed later in the evening (usually at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, depending on the length of the film that preceded it), which allows viewers which have This's primetime pre-empted by a secondary network to watch those films. From the network's launch until October 26, 2013, This TV ran a family film block preceding the network's Saturday morning \\"Cookie Jar Toons\\" lineup called \\"This Family Friendly\\"; under Tribune part-ownership, this block was discontinued, with a wider variety of films (mostly targeted at an adult audience) filling the block's former Saturday morning slot; however, family- oriented films remain part of the network's schedule, only airing on certain days in random timeslots and depending in part on the titles selected for that month's film slate. During 2014, the network shared select older film titles with sister network Antenna TV (which ran its own movie block until January 2015), with some films airing on both networks at different times during the same day or week. Classic television series In addition to its film content, the network also carries a modest amount of vintage comedy and drama series from the 1950s to the 1990s, airing in the early morning most days of the week and on weekend evenings. Its core bIock of classic programming is \\"TV Night on This,\\" a weekend-only prime time and late-night lineup – comprising multi-episode blocks of two series each night – which launched on January 10, 2016 as an extension of an existing Sunday evening rerun block that maintained a more generalized format dating back to the network's launch; , the lineup consists of Westerns (The Magnificent Seven and Dead Man's Gun) on Saturdays and police procedurals (In the Heat of the Night and Cagney & Lacey) on Sundays. Most of the network's series programming airs during the early morning hours during pre-determined breaks within the network's movie schedule (currently consisting of Sea Hunt, Flipper and Mackenzie's Raiders, ). After Tribune Broadcasting assumed operations of This TV, three series formerly seen on the network – The Patty Duke Show, Mister Ed and Green Acres – were moved from the network to new sister network Antenna TV. Children's programming Under Weigel's co-ownership, This TV featured a daily morning block of children's programs that was handled by Toronto-based Cookie Jar Entertainment, then by WildBrain (known as DHX Media at the time) when it purchased Cookie Jar in 2012. It also featured a Weigel-produced program originally produced for its Chicago flagship WCIU-TV, Green Screen Adventures (which now airs exclusively on MeTV outside of the Chicago market). The block's core children's programming was branded under the banner name \\"This is for Kids\\", while a separate lineup of Cookie Jar-produced shows that met the Federal Communications Commission's educational content requirements was branded under the name \\"Cookie Jar Toons\\". Children's programs featured in the blocks included library content from CJE entities DiC Entertainment and Cinar Films, as well as recent originally produced content by Cookie Jar. The block competed with other Saturday-morning cartoon blocks, including 4Kids TV on Fox, ABC Kids on ABC, AniMeTV on MeTV, and the Toonzai and Vortexx blocks on The CW. However, 4Kids TV was replaced by Weekend Marketplace, a paid programming block, in 2008,Schneider, Michael. \\"Longform ads replace kid fare on Fox\\", Variety,23 November 2008. Retrieved on 25 March 2018. while AniMeTV and Toonzai were discontinued because of bankruptcy/acquisition. (the latter was replaced by Vortexx) ABC replaced ABC Kids with the E/I-compliant Litton's Weekend Adventure in 2011. Cookie Jar Toons/This is for Kids had its program breaks filled with a mix of regular commercials, PSA's, and promotions for shows on the block. Prominent advertisers for the block included the Ad Council, McDonald's, General Mills, Chuck E. Cheese's, Gerber Life, K12, Juicy Drop Pop, Hasbro, Skechers, and Gamefly. Once Tribune assumed part-ownership of This TV, the network relegated its children's program solely to Sunday mornings, coinciding with discontinuance of the network's agreement with Cookie Jar/DHX (effectively ending This's status as the only digital multicast network and one of only two broadcast networks, alongside The CW (which discontinued Vortexx in favor of the fully E/I-compliant One Magnificent Morning in October 2014), to carry a traditional entertainment-based children's block rather than a strictly educational-based lineup); the former Cookie Jar Toons/This is for Kids block was replaced with a three-hour weekly block of E/I-compliant programs originally distributed for syndication by Bellum Entertainment Group; these were joined by select series from Steve Rotfeld Productions in March 2016. On May 3, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would launch KidsClick, a multiplatform children's programming endeavor featuring long-form and short-form animated content from various production studios. Sinclair named This TV as the national carrier of the venture's three-hour morning cartoon block, which debuted on July 1 – coinciding with the launch of a syndicated version that would initially be carried on Sinclair-operated stations in certain markets. On July 1, 2018, This TV discontinued carriage of KidsClick, which was transferred full-time to Sinclair-owned online content-focused network TBD (which began carrying the block on a transitional basis two months prior on May 7). KidsClick would later be discontinued on March 31, 2019. Affiliates In addition to its carriage on Weigel-owned stations in Chicago (WCIU-TV), Milwaukee (WDJT-TV) and South Bend, Indiana (WCWW-LD) at the network's launch, This TV reached affiliation agreements with several television station groups – including Hearst Television, the Sinclair Broadcast Group, Post-Newsweek Stations, Fisher Communications, Raycom Media and Belo – to add the network on the subchannels of some of their stations in 2009. A May 2010 renewal of its affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting expanded the network to additional stations owned by the company in markets such as Los Angeles, New York City, Miami and San Diego, helping increase This TV's market coverage to 85% of the U.S. and making it the largest subchannel network by population reach percentage (a status that has since been surpassed by former sister network MeTV). A number of NBC affiliates added This TV as a replacement for the now-defunct NBC Weather Plus service, which shut down in November 2008. Additionally, Equity Media Holdings selected This TV as a replacement for the Retro Television Network on some of its stations after the company terminated its relationship with RTN in January 2009 due to a payment dispute; the Equity-owned stations have since been sold, with several disaffiliating from This TV or ceasing operations completely. Stations that carry This TV have the option to air select programming from the network on their main channels; affiliates also have the option to preempt select This TV programs, running alternate programming in place of certain shows from the network's national schedule (some stations may even switch to scheduled alternate programming while a film is in progress), either via a secondary affiliation deal with another network such as The CW or MyNetworkTV (this is particularly common with This TV affiliates in smaller markets), substitutions by locally produced programming, or in the most common case, moving network programming to the This subchannel to accommodate local sports or breaking news coverage on the main channel. With Tribune Broadcasting taking over operational responsibilities for the network, This TV became one of the few television networks to move its flagship station; the network moved from WCIU to a digital subchannel of Tribune's Chicago flagship WGN-TV (which until November 1, 2013 was the largest Tribune-owned station by market size not to carry This TV). In Milwaukee, Weigel continued to carry the network on WDJT following Tribune's December 2013 acquisition of the market's Fox affiliate, WITI (which also carries sister network Antenna TV); on March 3, 2015, Weigel moved This to WDJT's sister independent station, WMLW-TV, on its DT3 subchannel; its former channel slot on WDJT was concurrently filled by the Weigel-owned network Heroes & Icons, effectively consolidating the group's main subchannel networks onto WDJT's digital signal while allowing Weigel to fulfill its existing contract for This TV; through the move, the network's cable coverage was affected in the channel exchange with some area cable providers having to sign new agreements to carry the network via WMLW-DT3. In South Bend, its status on WCWW did not change, partly because Tribune does not own a television station in that market, unlike in Chicago and Milwaukee. Weigel transferred This to WYTU-LD3 on January 8, 2018 due to a large-scale channel remapping involving the spectrum auction, finally discontinuing their run of This TV in Milwaukee on September 3, 2018 upon the launch of Start TV. WITI and other stations owned by Local TV – which Tribune bought in July 2013 and finalized its purchase of that December – where the network has yet to transfer its affiliation will likely affiliate with the network at some point in the long-term (in markets where Tribune owns only one station, This TV may be carried on a tertiary subchannel; in duopoly markets, a Tribune station without any existing secondary subchannels may be required to create one to serve as the local This TV affiliate); in most markets where Tribune owns a former Local TV station, and the existing Tribune stations in four markets where the network is not carried (KIAH/Houston, KCPQ-KZJO/Seattle, KTXL/Sacramento and WPMT/Harrisburg), however, This TV has existing affiliation deals with stations owned by other station groups via national carriage deals; it is possible that Tribune may wait until these affiliation contracts lapse before moving the network to those affected stations, though because many of those deals are with national groups such as Hearst carrying the network in overlapping Tribune markets (which is the case with the Sacramento and Harrisburg situations), they may be renewed without an immediate move to a Tribune station to maintain affiliate relations. The first Tribune station to affiliate with the network since its purchase of Local TV and assumption of the network's operations was KAUT-TV in Oklahoma City, which joined the network on December 24, 2014, after KSBI dropped its This- affiliated subchannel upon Griffin Communications taking over its operations earlier that month, citing low ratings. In 2014, Tribune began to produce promotional advertisements for This TV that it distributes to its affiliates for broadcast on their main signals (which are modified to allow stations to insert over-the-air and cable channel information) in high definition. A number of former Tribune stations (Tribune had been acquired by Nexstar Media Group on September 19, 2019) dropped This TV towards the end of October 2019 due to a new agreement with Katz Broadcasting to carry a reincarnated version of the court/true crime news network Court TV made before the close of the Nexstar deal. A few markets saw This TV move to a new station, though for the most part, the network has lost distribution from its own parent company in many major markets.

Built in 1929 as a Ralphs Grocery Store, it was one of the original six buildings in the Westwood Village development. The building was noted for its cylindrical rotunda capped by a low saucer dome, with a pediment over the entrance and arcaded wings extending north and east. It was photographed by Ansel Adams in 1940, declared a Historic-Cultural Monument in 1988, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Origins of Westwood Village The history of Westwood Village began in 1925, when the Regents of the University of California purchased a large block of land from the Janss Investment Company for the construction of the new UCLA campus. The Janss family retained ownership of the land south of the campus and there developed Westwood Village — a carefully planned commercial center that was to be \\"a model college town.\\" The university and the Janss family agreed to harmonize the architecture of the campus and the village in a \\"Mediterranean style.\\" Architecture and opening of Ralphs Grocery Store Ralphs Grocery Store during construction in 1929; photograph from Los Angeles Public Library collections The new Westwood Village began to open in 1929, and one of its original buildings was the Ralphs Grocery Store located on Westwood Boulevard, one block north of Wilshire Boulevard. The store's most prominent feature was its low rotunda, at the corner of Westwood Boulevard and Lindbrook Drive. The building's exterior walls were built with imitation stone, but were later covered with stucco. The building's style has been described as having Mission Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Romanesque Revival and Renaissance Revival elements, and is said to have served as a model for other low-rise commercial structures in the village. Early advertising materials for the Westwood Village development featured images of the Ralphs tower and the Janss dome, which became area landmarks. The opening of the store in the fall of 1929 was timed to coincide with the opening of the UCLA campus, and the Los Angeles Times proclaimed the store \\"one of the most beautiful exclusive grocery marts in the West.\\" The opening was celebrated with a free food show, as Ralphs boasted a new feature at their Westwood store -- \\"the employment of uniformed boys to wrap each purchase of merchandise while it is being paid for at the cashier's stand, and then carry it to the customer's car.\\" In 1940, Ansel Adams took a series of photographs of Westwood Village, some featuring the Ralphs building. The photographs are part of the collections of the Los Angeles Public Library and can be viewed here, here and here. (By entering \\"Ralphs\\" as the \\"Keyword\\" and \\"Adams\\" as the \\"Photographer\\", the database will pull up the three Ansel Adams photographs linked above with detailed credit information.) Businesses operating in the building Ralphs operated a grocery store on the site until the mid-1960s, when it left Westwood Village. Ralphs returned to Westwood Village nearly 40 years later, converting the old Bullock's department store into a grocery store (formerly sharing the space with a Best Buy and an Expo Home Design Center). Since Ralphs vacated the building in the mid-1960s, it has housed a number of different businesses. In 1970 a large portion of the space facing Lindbrook Drive was converted into a movie theater, which was known over the years as the United Artists Theater, (where The Rocky Horror Picture Show made its US debut on September 26, 1975) the UA Egyptian, the Odeon Cinema. and finally as the Mann Festival which closed on July 30, 2009. The Bratskeller restaurant, popular with UCLA students, also operated at the building from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the prime corner space at the base of the tower was split between Daphne's Greek Cafe and Togo's Sandwich Restaurant. In late 2008, they were replaced with a Peet's Coffee & Tea, which remains currently. In early 2012, part of the shuttered movie theater was converted to 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria. Historic preservation and designation Modern high rise behind Spanish-Mediterranean Ralphs building Since the 1970s, the demand for office and residential space around the UCLA campus has resulted in much of the original Mediterranean architecture giving way to large modern high rises, as depicted in the photograph to the right. Preservationists sought to preserve what could be saved of the original Westwood architecture, and in 1988 the Ralphs-Bratskeller-Egyptian Theater building was designated as a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #360) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. Eight other historic buildings in Westwood Village (including the Fox Bruin Theater, the Fox Village Theater and the Janss Investment Company Building) were given monument status at the same time. In 1992, the Ralphs building was also added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The post office at Oxbow then replaced the office at Homestead. Homestead was platted around 1898 along a Northwest Railway Company line that never developed.

His books ranged from Quaker journal anthologies to philosophical and historical dissertations on the faith, establishing him as a prominent commentator on the Society of Friends.  Early life  Howard Brinton was born on 24 July 1884, in West Chester, Pennsylvania to a Quaker couple, who were from different strands of the Quaker faith: his father Orthodox and his mother Hicksite.Living the Peace Testimony: the legacy of Howard and Anna Brinton by Anthony Manousos. Wallingford, Pennsylvania, Pendle Hill, 2004 (Pendle Hill pamphlets #372)  Academic career  He studied at Haverford College with Rufus Jones and graduated in 1905, obtaining a master's degree in 1906. He taught at Olney Friends School in Barnesville, Ohio, and at Pickering College in New Market, Ontario. In 1909, he obtained a doctorate in Physics from Harvard. In 1916, Howard Brinton was appointed acting President of Guilford College, North Carolina, at a troubled time for the college. He visited conscientious objectors imprisoned at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, who were not permitted to communicate with outside and whose location was not known to their relatives and friends. AFSC  This visit inspired him to join, in 1919, the American Friends Service Committee soon after, which allowed Quakers and other pacifists to serve during wartime in nonviolent means. It also co-ordinated relief to the victims of war. The chaotic consequences of war, that he witnessed in Upper Silesia influenced his work as a pacifist speaker and writer in the 1920s and 1930s. It was during this period that he met Anna Shipley Cox (19 October 1887 - 28 October 1969), who also worked in Europe for AFSC. They married when he returned to the United States for a biography of Anna Brinton see Pendle Hill pamphlets #176 (1971) Anna Brinton: a Study in Quaker Character by Eleanore Price Mather on 25 July 1921.Date of marriage deduced from Manousos (p. 31): \\"She returned home to Pendle Hill [in 1946] on 23 July, the twenty-fifth anniversary of her marriage\\". Academic career (continued)  In 1925, he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy from the University of California, while Anna taught at Mills College. Then they moved to Earlham College, Indiana, where both taught and their first three children were born. In 1929, they returned to California, where their fourth child was born and both taught at Mills. During this period he became involved in the case of Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. In 1931, they spent a year in England at Woodbrooke Quaker College in Birmingham. In that year, Howard gave the Swarthmore Lecture at London Yearly Meeting, with the title Creative Worship. Pendle Hill  In 1936, Howard and Anna Cox Brinton became co-directors at the Pendle Hill religious center in Wallingford, Pennsylvania.Manousos p.19: Howard became Acting Director in 1934 A pen portrait of Pendle Hill in the Brinton period appeared in Time Magazine 21 June 1948. The article indicates the diversity of the students and the variety of their studies. Brinton used this opportunity to produce over a dozen books and pamphlets dealing with Quakerism. Ironically, one of his most productive writing periods came during World War II, during which he published the widely used \\"A Guide to Quaker Practice.\\". One of his later works, \\"Friends for 300 Years,\\" was cited by Elizabeth Vining as \\"one of the great Quaker books of all time.\\" Japan and later years In 1949, Anna Brinton left Pendle Hill to work with AFSC. Howard continued until 1952, when he retired and the couple moved to Japan, in AFSC service. They returned to Pendle Hill in 1954. Howard's Japanese secretary, Yuki Takahashi, a widow, returned with them to help her employer write his memoirs, which have never been published. In May 1972, the nearly blind and aged Brinton, having obtained consent from his adult children, surprised everyone by marrying Takahashi. Howard Brinton died on 9 April 1973. He is buried with Anna Brinton at the Oakland Friends Cemetery, West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania.

The School of Art & Art History programs comprise artists, scholars, museum workers, educators, and researchers, all within the nation’s most diverse public research university. Affirming that humanity survives and advances through radical imagination and the arts, they educate students to rigorously engage in art’s vibrant corollaries: dialogue, critique, experimentation, and social justice. The School of Theatre & Music programs provide innovative, rigorous, and comprehensive academic and performance programs as part of an urban context.

Early life Reid was born in Drury in 1867, some distance south of Auckland. His parent had arrived in New Zealand from Argyllshire in Scotland in circa 1865. His parents were Margaret and Walter Reid, but his father's obituary published in the Auckland Star in July 1925 erroneously talks of Andrew Reid. The family lived in Drury, and then in Wairoa in the Hawke's Bay Region. From approximately age eight, Reid lived at Tuhikaramea near present-day Temple View in the Waipa District. He married Margaret Donnet Hodgson on 8 April 1897. Political career Reid was involved in local affairs and served as chairman of the Waipa County Council, as a member of the Tuhikaramea Road Board and school committees, and as a member of the No. 2 District Highways Board and the Central Electric Power board. When the Rural Counties' Association formed in 1925, Reid was elected onto the provisional executive. Reid was chosen as the official candidate for the Reform Party in early September 1925 for the electorate. In the , Reid successfully challenged the incumbent, Frederick Lye of the Liberal Party. At the next election in , Lye in turn defeated him. He then defeated Lee Martin of the Labour Party for the Raglan electorate in 1931, but lost Raglan to Martin with the landslide to Labour in 1935. Later life and death In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Reid died on 6 May 1952 and was buried at Paterangi Cemetery. His wife died in July 1959 and was buried in the same grave.

Since Mollaret's meningitis is a recurrent, benign (non-cancerous), aseptic meningitis, it is also referred to as benign recurrent lymphocytic meningitis. It was named for Pierre Mollaret, the French neurologist who first described it in 1944. Although chronic meningitis has been defined as \\"irritation and inflammation of the meninges persisting for more than 4 weeks being associated with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid\\", cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities may not be detectable for the entire time. Diagnosis can be elusive, as Helbok et al. note: \\"in reality, many more weeks, even months pass by until the diagnosis is established. In many cases the signs and symptoms of chronic meningitis not only persist for periods longer than 4 weeks, they even progress with continuing deterioration, i. e. headache, neck stiffness and even low grade fever. Impairment of consciousness, epileptic seizures, neurological signs and symptoms may evolve over time.\\" Signs and symptoms Mollaret's meningitis is characterized by chronic, recurrent episodes of headache, stiff neck, meningismus, and fever; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with large \\"endothelial\\" cells, neutrophil granulocytes, and lymphocytes; and attacks separated by symptom-free periods of weeks to years; and spontaneous remission of symptoms and signs. Many people have side effects between bouts that vary from chronic daily headaches to after-effects from meningitis such as hearing loss and visual impairment, nerve pain and twitches. Symptoms may be mild or severe. Some cases may be short, lasting only 3–7 days, while others last for weeks to months. While herpes simplex and varicella can cause rash, Mollaret's patients may or may not have a rash. Herpes simplex virus is likely the most common cause of Mollaret's meningitis. Cause Although for a long time, the cause of Mollaret's meningitis was not known, recent work has associated this problem with herpes simplex viruses, particularly HSV-2. Cases of Mollaret's resulting from varicella zoster virus infection, diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been documented. In these cases, PCR for herpes simplex was negative. Some patients also report frequent shingles outbreaks. Varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles is part of the herpes family, and is sometimes called \\"herpes zoster virus\\".Mollaret's meningitis at patient.co.uk CNS epidermoid cysts can give rise to Mollaret's meningitis especially with surgical manipulation of cyst contents. A familial association, where more than one family member had Mollaret's, has been documented. Diagnosis Diagnosis starts by examining the patient's symptoms. Symptoms can vary. Symptoms can include headache, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. In some patients, fever is absent. Neurological examination and MRI can be normal. Mollaret's meningitis is suspected based on symptoms, and can be confirmed by HSV 1 or HSV 2 on PCR of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although not all cases test positive on PCR. PCR is performed on spinal fluid or blood, however, the viruses do not need to enter the spinal fluid or blood to spread within the body: they can spread by moving through the axons and dendrites of the nerves. During the first 24 h of the disease the spinal fluid will show predominant polymorphonuclear neutrophils and large cells that have been called endothelial (Mollaret's) cells. A study performed on patients who had diffuse symptoms, such as persistent or intermittent headaches, concluded that although PCR is a highly sensitive method for detection, it may not always be sensitive enough for identification of viral DNA in CSF, due to the fact that viral shedding from latent infection may be very low. The concentration of viruses in CSF during subclinical infection might be very low. Investigations include blood tests (electrolytes, liver and kidney function, inflammatory markers and a complete blood count) and usually X-ray examination of the chest. The most important test in identifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord) through lumbar puncture (LP). However, if the patient is at risk for a cerebral mass lesion or elevated intracranial pressure (recent head injury, a known immune system problem, localizing neurological signs, or evidence on examination of a raised ICP), a lumbar puncture may be contraindicated because of the possibility of fatal brain herniation. In such cases, a CT or MRI scan is generally performed prior to the lumbar puncture to exclude this possibility. Otherwise, the CT or MRI should be performed after the LP, with MRI preferred over CT due to its superiority in demonstrating areas of cerebral edema, ischemia, and meningeal inflammation. During the lumbar puncture procedure, the opening pressure is measured. A pressure of over 180 mm H2O is suggestive of bacterial meningitis. It is likely that Mollaret meningitis is underrecognized by physicians, and improved recognition may limit unwarranted antibiotic use and shorten or eliminate unnecessary hospital admission. This shows the results of polymerase chain reaction tests on a chronic Mollaret's meningitis patient, along with symptoms. PCR testing has advanced the state of the art in research, but PCR can be negative in individuals with Mollaret's, even during episodes with severe symptoms. For example, Kojima et al. published a case study for an individual who was hospitalized repeatedly, and who had clinical symptoms including genital herpes lesions. However, the patient was sometimes negative for HSV-2 by PCR, even though his meningitis symptoms were severe. Treatment with acyclovir was successful, indicating that a herpes virus was the cause of his symptoms. Treatment=Initial treatment Acyclovir is the treatment of choice for Mollaret's meningitis. Some patients see a drastic difference in how often they get sick and others don't. Often treatment means managing symptoms, such as pain management and strengthening the immune system. The IHMF recommends that patients with benign recurrent lymphocytic meningitis receive intravenous acyclovir in the amount of 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, for 14–21 days. More recently, the second-generation antiherpetic drugs valacyclovir and famciclovir have been used to successfully treat patients with Mollaret's. Additionally, it has been reported that Indomethacin administered in the amount of 25 mg 3 times per day after meals, or 50 mg every 4 hours, has resulted in a faster recovery for patients, as well as more extended symptom- free intervals, between episodes.  Recovery  Recurring Mollaret meningitis attacks generally resolve within 3 to 5 years after the first occurrence, but some patients live with the disease for much longer. With suppressive antiviral therapy, some patients who have Mollaret's report experiencing fewer attacks. However, there are some that have flare ups all throughout the year.

It lies northwest of Baker City along Pocahontas Road near the Elkhorn Mountains. The town was named after Pocahontas, a famous Native American woman. According to Oregon Geographic Names, which cites Thirty-One Years in Baker County, an unknown number of people laid out a town called Pine City in the 1860s near the base of the mountains. Pine City, probably founded in 1862, was along Pine Creek and was meant to serve as a place of accommodation for miners and others traveling through the region. Meanwhile, John McClain, a rancher who lived nearby, established Pocahontas and persuaded the people of Pine City to move there. Pocahontas, also meant as a traveler's resting stop, soon had a hotel, blacksmith shop, and express office. It set up a post office on August 4, 1863, with Thomas McMurran as postmaster. The year of the post- office closing is in doubt, either 1864 or 1872.

The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary 2004, p311 by the American artist George Brecht. Originally published in Germany, June 1963Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams 1989, p216 in a box designed by George Maciunas and typeset by Tomas Schmit, it has been re- published in various countries several times since. It is now considered one of the most influential artworks released by Fluxus,Dada and Radical Art Online the internationalist avant-garde art movement active predominantly in the 1960s and '70s. The box, sometimes referred to as a Fluxbox or Fluxkit, contains a large number of small printed cards, containing instructions known as event-scores, or fluxscores. Typically open-ended, these scores, whether performed in public, private or left to the imagination, leave a lot of space for chance and indeterminancy, forcing a large degree of interpretation upon the performers and audience. > In some cases [event-scores] would arise out of the creation of the object, > while in others the object was discovered and Brecht subsequently wrote a > score for it, thus highlighting the relationship between language and > perception. Or, in the words of the artist, \\"ensuring that the details of > everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop > going unnoticed.\\" The event-score was as much a critique of conventional > artistic representation as it was a gesture of firm resistance against > individual alienation. The work is considered an important precursor to conceptual art. The scores Three Lamp Event, part of Lantern Extract, a mail art project within the Yam Festival, 1962, Early editions of Water Yam collected around 70 event- scores together, created over a four-year period from 1959 to 1963. Later editions would add extra events (up to about 100), as well as a small flick book Nut Bone. A Yamfest Movie, and white-on-black invitations to contact Brecht via a New York PO Box and arrange 'deliveries and relocations'. Many of the scores had been used in mail art events between 1961 and '63, occasionally hand-written, typed or hectographed, more usually typeset; often signed neatly at the bottom of the card. When Maciunas collected the scores together the typeset style was kept, but the signatures were removed. The reliance on bullet points (•) separating the performances from their title was a feature that remained consistent throughout the versions. The cards are all different sizes. The scores divide roughly into three sections; the earliest ones, 1959–62, describe events intended to be performed (such as Solo for Violin, Viola, Cello or Contrabass • Polish, July 1962); a second group of scores from '62-63 tend towards describing the temporary creation of assemblages; (such as Chair Event • on a white chair a grater, tape measure, alphabet, flag, black and spectral colours, April 1962). The third group, also 1962-63, are more personal and abstract; (such as Thursday • Thursday, March 1963). When originally published, Maciunas decided to emphasize 14 of the more musical scores (such as the famous Drip Music; A source of dripping water and an empty vessel are arranged so that the water falls into the vessel, January 1962) by printing them on orange cards, whilst the rest (such as Keyhole •Through either side) were printed on Brecht's more usual plain white card. Origins of event-scores=John Cage and the experimental composition classes Brecht met the artist Robert Watts at Rutgers University in 1957, and through Watts, Allan Kaprow. The three started to meet regularly for lunch at a local branch of Howard Johnson's, New Jersey. After a meeting with John Cage organised by Brecht whilst the latter was in New Jersey hunting mushrooms,Allan Kaprow, quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p264 the three men started to attend Cage's experimental music composition classes at the New School for Social Research in New York. In the classes, Cage encouraged his students to use chance and games as major elements in the creation of art. Initially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest Happenings, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd \\"never felt so controlled before.\\"Quoted in George Brecht, by Yve-Alain Bois prompting Brecht to pare the scores down to haiku-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed. As well as Cage's constructive criticism, Brecht was becoming increasingly interested in Marcel Duchamp's theories on art, which he'd written about at length in Chance- Imagery, a text written in 1957 but only published in 1966 by the Something Else Press. > It was only while reading Robert Lebel's 1959 monograph on Duchamp and > pondering the consequences of the readymade that Brecht truly understood > what he was searching for: Just as the readymade is an object lifted from > its mere commodity status by being transported into an art context, the > \\"event\\" would be an act--often a simple one performed daily, such as turning > on and off a switch--on which he would cast his spotlight in order to force > us to pay attention to it, in order, as the Russian formalists would have > said, to \\"make it strange\\" and \\"de-automatize our perception.\\" An exhibition of Brecht's work held at the Reuben Gallery, October 1959 Toward Events: An Arrangement clearly pointed the way: The press release stated that 'art is to become actively rather than passively existent, to be enjoyed as an unfolding experience....works, or 'events,' such as The Dome, The Case, The Cabinet, are presented three dimensionally.'Quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p34 The final piece in the jigsaw, combining a Duchampian love of chance with a scientific belief in art as research, was an epiphany Brecht had in 1960, in which he decisively separated the artwork from the control of the artist; The Yam Festival, 1963 Yam was a name thought up by Brecht and Watts in late 1962 to act as an umbrella project 'for all manner of immaterial, experimental, as yet unclassified forms of expression.'George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p68 Specifically intending to provide a platform for 'art that could not be bought,' the earliest Yam events involved mailing event cards and other objects stamped with the word 'Yam', or variations, to friends. Designed to increase anticipation, the project reached a head with a month-long series of events in May, 1963, in New York, Rutger's University and George Segal's farm. The Yam Festival was held on a farm in South Brunswick, New Jersey on 19 May 1963 to actions and happenings by artists including Dick Higgins, Allan Kaprow, La Monte Young, and Wolf Vostell. The festival was organised as a wide ranging series of events taking place throughout the month, whose main objective was to bypass traditional gallery outlets, giving artists and 'receivers' greater freedom. Wolf Vostell made here his happening TV Burying.Yam Festival, 1963, Wolf Vostell, TV Burying Artists participating in the festival included Alison Knowles, Allan Kaprow, John Cage, Al Hansen, Ay-O, Dick Higgins, La Monte Young, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Ray Johnson. The festival has come to be seen as a proto-fluxus event, involving many of the same artists. Yam evolved parallel to George Maciunas' Fluxfests,Oxford Art Online, Fluxus essay by Michael Corris, Subscription Only set up with almost identical aims but currently operating only in Europe whilst Maciunas was stationed in Germany. The International Fluxus Festival of the Newest Music (Festum Fluxorum), 1962–63, would feature the work of artists such as Cage, Raoul Hausmann and Nam June Paik. Brecht's event-scores, including the famous Drip Event, were amongst the pieces Maciunas would perform, along with pieces by Kaprow, Watts, Daniel Spoerri, Robert Filliou, Terry Riley, Emmett Williams, Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell and Dick Higgins. Maciunas in Germany Brecht's Drip Music, performed by George Maciunas, Amsterdam, 1963 Clearly aware of the Yam Festival, Maciunas brought together 73 of Brecht's event-scores whilst working as a free-lance designer for the US army stationed at Ehlhalten near Wiesbaden,Tomas Schmitt, Maciunas' assistant in 1963 quoted in George Brecht Events; A Heterospective, Robinson, Walter König p276 and placed them in a box with a fine example of his graphic design pasted onto the cover. Maciunas referred to the box as 'Brecht's complete works'Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p217 and intended it to be the first in a series compiling works by artists he admired. Few of these intended 'collected works' ever saw the light of day. The use of multiple fonts derived from his interest in experimental typography by Dada figures such as Hugo Ball and Raoul Hausmann, and was to prove crucial in defining a recognisable style for fluxus products. Published in spring 1963, the box was designed to be the cheapest and simplest way of disseminating art, and in keeping with Maciunas' beliefs, was neither numbered nor signed, although later editions would be published as limited, numbered editions. The box is the very first Fluxkit, and the only published link between Brecht and Watt's Yam Festival, and Maciunas' FluxFests. Later versions It has since been re-published a number of times with differing numbers of event-scores, alternate designs on the cover, and housed in various materials, including plastic boxes and wooden ones. It is worth noting that later editions such as the English Parrot Impressions, 1972, or the Lebeer Hossmann edition, 1986, don't include Maciunas' graphic design, and don't include the word Fluxus anywhere in or on the work.

The U.S. and its allies were attempting to capture an airfield constructed by the Japanese at Munda Point on New Georgia with which to support further advances towards the main Japanese base around Rabaul as part of Operation Cartwheel. The Japanese attack saw one infantry regiment from the Southeast Detachment carry out a frontal assault against the center and left of the U.S. front line, while another carried out a flanking attack on their left aimed at enveloping the U.S. forces and cutting them off from their supply line. While the frontal assault was checked, the flanking attack succeeded in breaking into the rear of the U.S. beachhead. Many casualties were inflicted among the logistics, support and medical troops in the area, and the 43rd Infantry Division's command post came under attack before heavy defensive artillery fire and local defensive fighting forced the Japanese attackers back. Ultimately, the Japanese attack was unsuccessful, having been badly coordinated, and after a brief lull in the fighting, the U.S. forces launched a two-week long corps- level offensive that captured the airfield on 4–5 August 1943. Background=Strategic situation In the wake of the Guadalcanal campaign, concluded in early 1943, the Allies formulated plans to advance through the Central Solomons towards Bougainville, in conjunction with further operations in New Guinea. These plans formed part of the effort to reduce the main Japanese base around Rabaul, which was designated Operation Cartwheel. Capture of the airfield at Munda would facilitate further assaults on Vila, Kolombangara and Bougainville.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 73Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 52 For the Japanese, New Georgia formed a key part of the defenses protecting the southern approaches to Rabaul. Accordingly, they sought to defend the area strongly, and moved reinforcements by barge along the Shortlands–Vila–Munda supply line.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, backcoverMorison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 180 The Allied campaign plan for securing New Georgia, designated Operation Toenails by U.S. planners, involved several landings by elements of Major General Oscar Griswold's XIV Corps to secure staging areas and an airfield in the southern part of New Georgia at Wickham Anchorage, Viru Harbor and Rendova. Once captured, these would then be garrisoned to support the movement of troops and supplies from Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands to Rendova, which would be built up as base for further operations in New Georgia focused on securing the airfield at Munda. The New Georgia group of islands. Munda Point lies northwest of Rendova across 350px The Americans landed reconnaissance elements around Zanana on New Georgia on 30 June; this marked the start of the New Georgia campaign. These were followed by main force elements from Major General John H. Hester's 43rd Infantry Division on 2 July 1943, crossing from Rendova where they had landed on 30 June. After establishing a beachhead, the American troops made limited gains in their drive toward Munda Point and advanced slowly against strong opposition.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 92–94 & 120. From the outset, the Japanese forces around Zanana, consisting largely of troops from the 229th Infantry Regiment and 8th Combined Special Naval Landing Force, fought to delay the U.S. advance while reinforcements were dispatched.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 98–99 Over the course of several weeks, they delayed the U.S. troops' westward advance on Munda, and defeated an attempt to outflank their defenses.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 106–115Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 177 In order to renew the offensive, the U.S corps commander, Griswold, was sent to New Georgia to assess the situation. He reported back to Admiral William Halsey on Noumea that the situation was dire and requested reinforcements in the form of at least another division to break the stalemate.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 198 Griswold took over command of the troops in the field from Hester on 15 July and began preparations for a corps-level offensive. The build up would take about 10 days, and amidst this situation, the Japanese began preparations for a counterattack.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 199 Japanese reinforcements Japanese reinforcements arrived at New Georgia during July. The initial reinforcements comprised approximately 3,000 troops from the 13th and 229th Infantry Regiments, as well as a number of support units. These soldiers were stationed in the Shortland Islands.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 98 The first attempt to transport soldiers to New Georgia began on 4 July, when four destroyers departed Buin in Bougainville. The Japanese ships broke off the attempt to land troops when they encountered a U.S. Navy bombardment force off Rice Anchorage in the early hours of 5 July, though they sank the destroyer .O'Hara, The U.S. Navy Against the Axis, pp. 170–173 The airfield at Munda Point The Japanese had more success in landing troops the next day. A larger force of destroyers was dispatched, and landed about 1,600 troops and 90 tons of supplies. The Japanese destroyers were intercepted by an American force of cruisers and destroyers, and in the Battle of Kula Gulf, which was fought during the early hours of 6 July, an American cruiser and two Japanese destroyers were sunk.O'Hara, The U.S. Navy Against the Axis, pp. 173–180 Three Japanese cruisers and four destroyers landed 1,200 soldiers unopposed on Kolombangara on the night of 9/10 July.O'Hara, The U.S. Navy Against the Axis, p. 180 On the night of 12/13 July, a further 1,200 Japanese soldiers were landed at Vila, though the Imperial Japanese Navy lost a light cruiser and the U.S. Navy a destroyer in the Battle of Kolombangara.O'Hara, The U.S. Navy Against the Axis, pp. 180–186 The troops landed at Kolombangara were subsequently moved to New Georgia by barge.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 100 Other Japanese units were moved to New Georgia piecemeal on board barges during July.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, p. 99 Overall, the units that arrived in the Munda Point area between early and mid-July were the 3rd Battalion of the 229th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Battalion of the 230th Infantry Regiment, the 13th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Battalion of the 10th Independent Mountain Regiment and anti-aircraft, anti-tank, engineer and signals units. In addition, the 2nd Battalion of the 45th Infantry Regiment was transferred from Bougainville to Bairoko on the north coast of New Georgia.Rottman, Japanese Army in World War II, p. 67 These reinforcements enabled the Japanese to maintain their strength on New Georgia and prepare a counterattack, despite the American advances. Opposing forces Around 30,000 U.S. troops were committed to actions around Munda throughout July and August, while the Japanese allocated around 8,000 troops.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 93 The U.S. troops were under the command of Griswold, commander of XIV Corps,Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 127 and the Japanese force was commanded by Major General Minoru Sasaki of the Southeast Detachment.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, pp. 32 & 54 For the counterattack, Sasaki's main fighting elements totaled around five infantry battalions.Hammel, Munda Trail, pp. 146–147 These were drawn from the 229th Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Genjiro Hirata, and the 13th Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Tomonari Satoshi.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, pp. 81–83 The U.S. troops allocated consisted mainly of three infantry regiments from Hester's 43rd Infantry Division; to reinvigorate the advance on Munda, Griswold had requested reinforcements from the 37th and 25th Infantry Divisions, commanded by Major Generals Robert S. Beightler and J. Lawton Collins respectively. Ultimately, though, these divisions would not complete their movement to the battle area until after the Japanese counterattack.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, p. 54Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 137 & 144Hammel, Munda Trail, p. 128 Battle Due to the decision by U.S. commanders to land at Zanana in early July, rather than further west along the coast, the American lines of communication became stretched and vulnerable as the advance towards Munda continued. Meanwhile, the inexperienced American troops were disorganized and suffering from poor morale and bad leadership, having become bogged down by harsh terrain and bad weather, which had quickly turned the jungle tracks into mud.Nalty, War in the Pacific: Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay, p. 121 Sasaki launched his counterattack at the moment that the U.S. advance halted to reorganize.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 104–105 The objective of the Japanese operation was to destroy the American forces on New Georgia by attacking their exposed flank and rear areas. It was intended that the attack would be coordinated with naval operations to cut off the American troops on New Georgia and air attacks on Allied logistical bases on the island elsewhere.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 99, 104 Sensing an advantage, Sasaki ordered the 13th Infantry Regiment to penetrate the U.S. right flank around the upper reaches of the Barike River and attack their rear elements, while elements of the 229th which were already occupying defensive positions along the front attacked the left flank.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 135–136 A total of six companies from two battalions of the 13th Infantry Regiment were committed to this effort, while the regiment's 2nd Battalion remained around Bairoko. These troops began moving from their assembly area in a plantation north of Munda on 14 July. Battle map depicting the battlefield shortly after the Japanese counterattack of 17/18 July While Tomonari's troops began their march, those of Hirata's 229th in the center of the line undertook a series of patrols and minor attacks to keep the U.S. forces off balance. Hampered by the terrain just as the U.S. troops had been, it took three days for Tomonari's troops to complete their preliminary move.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, pp. 82–83Shaw and Kane, Isolation of Rabaul p. 100 From the Barike, the Japanese began probing the Allied right flank, which was only lightly held by isolated outposts, before moving towards an assembly area for the main assault. Track improvement had not been completed in this area and, as a result, the U.S. outposts could not be reinforced quickly. Sasaki planned for Tomonari's forces to infiltrate this area and sever the supply lines from Zanana while Hirata's 229th Infantry Regiment advanced from Munda to assault the center and right of the U.S. line. In doing so, the Japanese hoped to complete an envelopment of the U.S. regiments holding the front. The element of surprise was lost, however, when U.S. patrols detected the infiltration. In the afternoon of 17 July, elements of the U.S. 43rd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop unsuccessfully attempted an ambush but were overwhelmed in the attempt.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 135–136Shaw & Kane Isolation of Rabaul, p. 104 Despite the Japanese commander's intentions to coordinate the efforts of the forces assigned to the counterattack, ultimately this was not achieved as the Japanese force lacked communications equipment. Japanese preparations were also disrupted by U.S. artillery fire around 11:30 on 17 July, which landed on the forward positions of the 229th Infantry Regiment just prior them forming up for the assault in the center of the U.S. line and this ultimately delayed their attack. Artillery and air strikes also broke up an effort by naval troops from the Yokosuka 7th Special Naval Landing Force to launch an amphibious landing behind the Allied front. Throughout 17 July, the 229th was kept off balance around the Laiana beachhead by the U.S. 172nd Infantry Regiment with well coordinated close armored support from several Marine Corps tanks, while the U.S. 169th Infantry Regiment carried out a local attack between Reincke Ridge and Kelley Hill with two battalions which kept the Japanese in contact throughout the day.Hammel, Munda Trail, pp. 122 & 138 Meanwhile, at around 16:00, the 13th Infantry Regiment reached a mangrove swamp on the bank of the Barike River, where they began to assemble for the attack on the beachhead.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 83 The rear area of the U.S. beachhead consisted of many spread out camps and facilities that were mainly occupied by logistics, support and technical troops. Throughout the night of 17–18 July, formed into small section or platoon-sized groups, the Japanese succeeded in infiltrating and attacking several isolated outposts in the American rear areas, which were hastily defended by small groups of support troops. Over several hours, they carried out minor raids against supply dumps and engineer depots, and ambushed medical parties, inflicting many casualties on the American forces. During the confused fighting, the Japanese raiders destroyed vital telephone switch boards in an effort to disrupt communications. Nevertheless, the US forces were able to maintain communications with their supporting artillery battalions through a single telephone and throughout the night the artillery liaison officer called down heavy barrages from offshore batteries in response, some within of the divisional command post.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 136 US reinforcements landing around Munda in the aftermath of the Japanese counterattack Although the attack in the rear areas continued throughout the night, the artillery fire prevented the Japanese from being able to concentrate in strength. The beachhead area was also attacked, but a force of 52 Marines from the 9th Defense Battalion commandeered two U.S. Army .30 caliber machine guns and occupied a defensive position on a knoll about inland, supported by an anti-tank platoon and an ad hoc force of another fifty service troops and artillerymen. From this position, at around 21:00 they ambushed a force of Japanese attackers moving from the command post to set up a mortar, while others manned the unit's antiaircraft guns. The Japanese made four efforts to push through the ambush, but ultimately withdrew, leaving at least 18 of their number dead.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, pp. 83–84 Other raiders attacked kitchen areas and medical facilities, including casualty clearing stations. At one aid station, several patients fought back, killing four Japanese.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 202 In other stations, the medics and doctors attempted to fight off Japanese infantrymen who bayoneted patients in their beds.Hammel, Munda Trail, p. 141 In the center of the line, and further to the south, just after midnight on 17–18 July, two battalions (the 2nd and 3rd) from Hirata's 229th Infantry Regiment began a series of attacks against elements of the US 169th Infantry Regiment. After the initial attack against the 1st Battalion, 169th Infantry Regiment around Kelley Hill failed, the second effort began well for the Japanese who were able to skillfully advance close to the line in places to hurl grenades into the US front line. Mortar fire attempted to flush these troops out, and eventually the Japanese effort in the center of the lines was fought to a standstill as the defending troops used the high ground to their advance, calling down accurate artillery barrages down on the attacking troops, of which at least 102 were killed. Two hundred men from the Japanese 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment, which had been withdrawing from the Segi area following earlier fighting around Viru Harbor, stumbled into the area and also joined in the attack against a company of the U.S. 169th Infantry Regiment.Hammel, Munda Trail, pp. 146–147 An assault against the 3rd Battalion, 103rd Infantry Regiment, which had been assigned to support the 172nd Infantry Regiment around the beach area, was also beaten back.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, p. 55 Griswold urgently requested reinforcements. A battery was dispatched to Zanana from Kokorana and the 148th Infantry Regiment began preparations to move from Rendova at first light. Ultimately, though, the attack on the beachhead petered out and the 13th Infantry Regiment melted into the jungle during the morning of 18 July. They would remain scattered in small numbers, and in the aftermath of the attack continued to harass U.S. troops. Sasaki hoped to be able to mount another effort to go on the offensive, but ultimately this opportunity did not eventuate.Shaw & Kane Isolation of Rabaul, p. 106 Aftermath According to the historian Eric Hammel, \\"the action cost both sides many lives\\", although exact casualty numbers are not specified.Hammel, Munda Point, p. 148 The US Army official historian John Miller Jr. judged that the Japanese 13th Infantry Regiment's attacks \\"caused a few casualties but accomplished very little, certainly not enough to justify its trip from Kolombangara\\". The first U.S. fighter aircraft lands at Munda Airfield, 14 August The arrival of U.S. reinforcements began early on 18 July, with elements of the 148th Infantry Regiment landing at Zanana. Having hurriedly embarked at Rendova, they had been told to expect to fight as soon as they landed, but the fighting around the beach had concluded by the time they arrived. They were quickly pushed inland by U.S. commanders to shore up their vulnerable right flank and open the Munda Trail; during this movement the regiment's advanced elements clashed several times with small groups of Japanese infantry. Efforts to relieve the 169th took several days, with minor actions continuing until 20 July, including an ambush around one of the bridges across the Barike.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 202 In the coming days both the 145th and 161st Infantry Regiments arrived, and deployed opposite three battalions from the Japanese 229th Infantry, and a company from the 230th. After the Japanese counterattack was defeated, the U.S. commanders completed preparations for a corps-level offensive to capture Munda, bringing in further reinforcements and supplies. A secondary landing had been undertaken closer to Munda, around Laiana, to shorten supply lines. Medical and logistic support was also improved utilizing the secondary landing beach that had been established around Laiana on 14 July. During the lull that followed, U.S. forces undertook a series of patrols to gather information about Japanese dispositions; a number of minor firefights took place during this time, with only limited casualties.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 106–107 Meanwhile, the Japanese commander, Sasaki, also resolved to renew the offensive. He ordered Tomonari to launch another counterattack on 25 July, aiming an attack on the U.S. right flank around Horseshoe Hill and then rolling up the Allied line east along the Munda Trail. Griswold ordered a renewed offensive on 22 July; this began three days later and nullified the Japanese efforts.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 143–146 Supported by a strong naval bombardment on Lambeti Plantation, between Munda and Laiana, augmented by shore-based artillery and airstrikes, on 25 July the U.S. attack commenced with two divisions being committed across the front.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 203 The 37th Division attacked towards Bibilo Hill while the 43rd Division drove towards Lambeti Plantation and the airfield.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 143–144 After a sustained offensive that lasted two weeks, the Allies eventually captured the airfield in the Battle of Munda Point on 4–5 August. As the Japanese began withdrawing from New Georgia towards Kolombangara, U.S. forces undertook mopping up operations throughout August, during which time they advanced north from Munda to link up with the U.S. Marines and U.S. Army troops that had landed around Bairoko in early July. Bangaa Islet was secured in late August, while Arundel Island was captured later the following month.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 135–136, 163–164, 167–172, 184 NotesReferences    Further reading      – Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War.

Some definitions of the term also extend to illegally produced alcoholic beverages. Consumption of such substances carries extreme health risks, both from the ethanol content and other more toxic substances that may be present. Users risk both acute poisoning from substances such as methanol, and chronic poisoning from substances such as lead. Most people turn to these as a last resort either out of desperation, being underaged or being unable to afford consumable alcoholic beverages (with homeless alcoholics) or due to lack of access to drinking ethanol (for example with prison inmates and individuals in psychiatric wards).  Common surrogate alcohols  Popular Russian Eau de Cologne \\"Тройной\\" (Troynoy; Triple) Many alcoholic liquids contain alcohol but are not meant to be ingested in the same way as alcoholic beverages. Typical surrogate alcohols include: *Hand sanitizer *Mouthwash *Aftershave or cologne *Cooking wine *Cleaning fluids such as Windex *Extracts *Charcoal lighter fluid *Rubbing alcohol *Windshield washer fluid *Antifreeze *Denatured alcohol – ethanol rendered unfit to drink by mixing with methanol or bittering agents *Sterno *Moonshine and other homemade alcohols, including two or more of the above mixed together *Disinfectants *Liquid soap *Paint *Ethanol fuel  Dangers to health  Most surrogate alcohols have very high alcoholic levels, some as high as 95%, and thus can lead to alcohol poisoning, along with other symptoms of alcohol abuse such as vertigo, impaired coordination, balance and judgment, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and even long-term effects such as heart failure, stroke, and death. Besides alcohol, there are many other toxic substances in surrogate alcohol such as hydrogen peroxide, antiseptics, ketones, as well as alcohols other than ethanol (drinking alcohol) such as isopropanol and methanol. Methanol, and to a far lesser extent isopropanol, is poisonous. The effect of other chemicals on health has not been adequately studied, and so the health risks are unclear. However, observations in countries with high consumption of surrogate alcohols, such as Russia, indicate that the impurities in the consumed drink lead to high mortality rates.\\"Russian 'Surrogate' Alcohols Are A Killer.\\" ScienceDaily.

History=Early history Ecclesfield Church and a mill in the village were in the possession of St Wandrille's Abbey in Normandy by 1142, when this was confirmed by a Papal Bull of Pope Innocent II. These were the abbey's most northerly possessions, and probably their most valuable. There is no written evidence of any building on the site before 1273, but an 1161 agreement between Richard de Lovetot and the Abbey mentions \\"the monks of Ecclesfield\\". In 1866, an outer wall of the Priory was uncovered, at the west end of the Chapel. The architect supervising the work claimed that this may have been 12th-century work, but there has been no further investigation of this. Religious use The Priory was in existence by 1273, when it was mentioned in a Papal Bull of Pope Clement IV, again confirming some of the Abbey's possessions. It acted as a cell of the abbey in Normandy. Many writers have assumed that this demonstrates that the surviving structures were built prior to this date, but David Hey notes that it is possible that a 12th-century structure was in use and was only replaced a few years later. The names of most priors from the early 14th century are known: *To 1328: Robert de Bosco *1328 - 49: John de Fauvel *1349 - 69: Robert Gullielmi *1369 - 71: William Fulmere *1371 - 72: John Burdet *1372 - 85: Sir Henry de Medbourne In 1357, the Abbey sent two armed messengers to bring Gullielmi back because he had ignored a summons questioning his \\"evil life and embezzlement of the priory's goods\\". Fulmere was ejected as he was not ordained, and Burdet was imprisoned in Newgate for threatening Fulmere. Upon his release, Burdet unsuccessfully challenged de Medbourne's appointment in Parliament. In 1386, the Priory was confiscated from the Abbey during the Hundred Years' War and given to the Priory of St Anne in Coventry. This was a Carthusian house, and did not send monks to Ecclesfield Priory, instead appointing vicars and chaplains. This system survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 noted that there was a dwelling house for the vicar, usually presumed to be either the Priory or a neighbouring structure. St Anne's was dissolved in 1539, and in 1542 the right to present vicars and collect tithes in Ecclesfield was purchased by Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury; it then passed through several hands to the Shirecliffe family. They converted the building into a farmhouse under the name Ecclesfield Hall, inserting a fireplace and mullioned windows. The priory chapel and room below were not altered. Domestic use A plan of Ecclesfield Priory and Hall before the alterations of 1866; the Hall is to the left, the Priory to the right. In 1637, John Harrison described \\"The scite of the mannor, or mansion house called Ecclesfield-hall with all the Out-houses there to belonginge some of them being in decay and some fallen downe. Also the orchard, gardens, yard, the conney-greave and the Intack lyinge next unto Ecclesfeild Churchyard...\\" An inventory of 1691 listed the Hall's rooms as \\"hall, little parlour adjoining to the hall, milk house, kitchen, brewhouse, oxen house, dining room, closet, buttery, cellar, Chappel parlour, passage, Chappel Chamber, Greene Chamber, passage, Servants Chamber, boulting house, hay lath, fold, stable and Old Chappell.\\" The Hall was greatly extended in 1736. It is uncertain whether any parts of the old building were demolished at this time. By the Victorian period, the Mediaeval portion had once again become known as \\"Ecclesfield Priory\\". Jonathan Eastwood wrote extensively about the Priory in his History of the Parish of Ecclesfield of 1862, and the surviving building was restored in 1866 by M. E. Hadfield. The Priory and Hall then became separate houses. Architecture Ecclesfield Priory before the alterations of 1866; the adjoining Hall is not shown. The surviving building consists of a north-south oriented block, with the chapel connected to its south-east corner. It is constructed of sandstone with Millstone Grit dressings and is built directly on the bedrock. The three-storey chapel block is of thinly coursed rubble, while the crosswing is of squared stone and is coursed. The main block was substantially altered in the 17th century and again in 1866, with windows dating from both periods. One first-floor room has a barrel vaulted ceiling with relief panels, while the original pointed doorway into the chapel survives. The chapel contains more mediaeval work, including original lancet windows, a piscina and an aumbry. The entire building is Grade II* listed.

The battle took place following a landing by U.S. troops on the western coast of New Georgia from Rendova, as part of an effort to capture the Japanese airfield that had been constructed at Munda Point. This advance had become bogged down and while the Allies brought forward reinforcements and supplies, the Japanese had launched a counterattack on 17–18 July. This effort was ultimately unsuccessful and afterwards U.S. forces launched a corps-level assault to reinvigorate their effort to capture the airfield. Against this drive, Japanese defenders from three infantry regiments offered stubborn resistance, but were ultimately forced to withdraw, allowing U.S. forces to capture the airfield on 5 August. The airfield later played an important role in supporting the Allied campaign on Bougainville in late 1943. Background Munda Point is on the western coast of mainland New Georgia. To its northwest lies Bangaa Island and to its south is Rendova, from which it is separated by the Blanche Channel and the Munda Bar.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 69 (map)Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 201 (map) At the time of the battle, the location's significance was derived from the airfield that the Japanese had established there. In the wake of the Guadalcanal campaign, concluded in early 1943, the Allies formulated plans to advance through the Central Solomons towards Bougainville, in conjunction with further operations in New Guinea, as part of the effort to reduce the main Japanese base around Rabaul under the guise of Operation Cartwheel. Capture of the airfield at Munda would facilitate further assaults on Vila, on Kolombangara, and Bougainville.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 73Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 52 For the Japanese, New Georgia formed a key part in their defenses along the southern approaches to Rabaul and they sought to defend the area strongly, moving reinforcements by barge along the Shortlands–Vila–Munda supply line.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44, backcoverMorison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 180 350px Rendova was secured in short order by U.S. forces who landed there on 30 June as part of the preliminary phase of the Allied operation to secure New Georgia. On 2 July 1943, Major General John H. Hester's 43rd Infantry Division crossed the Blanche Channel from Rendova. A few days later they began a westward advance towards the Japanese-held airfield at Munda Point. Over the course of two weeks, these forces undertook a slow advance along the coast towards the airfield. Held up by the dense jungle, difficult terrain and strong Japanese defenses, the U.S. troops became disorganized and the advance stalled after reaching the Japanese main line of resistance on 15 July.Hammel, The Munda Trail, p. 109 The inexperienced U.S. troops, hungry and tired, began to lose their fire discipline and forward momentum.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, pp. 52–54 There were also a high number of severe cases of combat stress reaction among U.S. troops during this time.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 120Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 177 Historian Samuel Eliot Morison described the situation: The airfield at Munda Point In order to renew the offensive, Major General Oscar W. Griswold, commander XIV Corps, was sent to New Georgia to assess the situation. He reported back to Admiral William Halsey on Noumea that the situation was dire and requested reinforcements in the form of at least another division to break the stalemate.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 198 Griswold took over command of the troops in the field on 15 July and began preparations for a corps-level offensive. The movement of reinforcements and supplies from Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands took time, and Sasaki took advantage of the disorder on the American side,Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 199 launching a counterattack on 17/18 July.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 135–136 Japanese preparations for the counterattack had begun with the movement of reinforcements from the 13th Infantry Regiment from Kolombangara and Bairoko.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 99, 104–105 On 14 July, six companies began their approach march, but were held up for three days by difficult terrain before reaching their assembly area. On 17 July, the Japanese troops launched an attack against the U.S. rear areas, raiding the 43rd Infantry Division's command post, kitchen areas and medical aid stations. Elements of the attacking force managed to penetrate as far as the original U.S. beachhead around Zanana, but were repulsed by artillery and counter penetration forces. Meanwhile, the Japanese 229th Infantry Regiment attacked the high ground held by the U.S. 103rd and 169th Infantry Regiments, where they came up against stiff defense. Eventually, the Japanese counterattack petered out on 18 July.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, p. 55 Battle The U.S. commander, Griswold, issued orders for an offensive aimed at capturing Munda airfield on 22 July.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 143–144 On 23 July, the U.S. 43rd Infantry Division was reinforced by the 37th and 25th Infantry Divisions. These divisions were commanded by Major Generals Robert S. Beightler and J. Lawton Collins.Miller Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 137 & 144Hammel, Munda Trail, p. 128 The following day, the U.S. preparations for the offensive were completed. The 37th was deployed inland with three regiments, the 145th,161st and 148th, positioned along the front from south to north. On their left, along the coast, the 43rd Infantry Division pushed two regiments forward, the 103rd and 172nd, and held the 169th back in reserve.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 145 (map) In total, U.S. forces assigned to the effort to capture Munda numbered around 30,000 men. Seven infantry regiments were ultimately committed from three different divisions. A US soldier inspects a Japanese pillbox Meanwhile, the Japanese commander, Major General Minoru Sasaki, disposed three battalions of Colonel Genjiro Hirata's 229th Infantry Regiment, reinforced by a single company from Colonel Wakichi Hisashige's 230th Infantry Regiment, which occupied a position around Kokengola Hill. The 13th Infantry Regiment was initially withdrawn northeast of Munda, but would be committed against the U.S. right flank, with initial Japanese plans conceiving a renewed counterattack on 25 July from this flank, although this did not come to fruition as the Allies launched their effort before the Japanese could execute their own.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 202 Japanese indirect fire support consisted of a number of units, including antiaircraft and antitank units. The Japanese committed around 8,000 troops.Rottman, Japanese Army in World War II, p. 67 These troops formed Sasaki's Southeastern Detachment and were drawn from the 6th and 38th Infantry Divisions, the 10th Mountain Artillery Regiment and the 15th Field Antiaircraft Regiment.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, p. 32Hammel, Munda Trail, p. 240 Across a frontage of around the Japanese defenders had established a series of defenses along a northwesterly axis from the beach at Ilangana. These defenses consisted of strong pillboxes and fortifications amidst thick jungle. These dominated several high features including Shimizu Hil, Horsehoe Hill, Kelley Hill and Reincke Ridge.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 144–145 Situated to provide mutual support, the pillboxes were well constructed with coral and coconut logs. Dug-in several feet beneath the ground, they were well camouflaged and only a small part showed above ground with firing points for machine gunners and riflemen.Lofgren, Northern Solomons, p. 20 The U.S. attack began on 25 July, with the 37th Division attacking towards Bibilo Hill while the 43rd Division drove towards Lambeti Plantation and the airfield.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 144 The attack was heavily supported by naval gunfire and artillery support. This included 105 mm and 155 mm field pieces, while the destroyers fired their 6-inch deck guns. Allied aircraft also carried out airstrikes along the coast. While visually spectacular, and involving thousands of rounds, the preparatory fires did not initially result in a breakthrough for U.S. forces. The defending Japanese troops were able to reoccupy their pillboxes after the barrage. The U.S. Marine M3 Stuart tanks from the 9th Defense Battalion that were supporting the infantry found the ground too steep and eventually the U.S. attack stalled. No gains were made by the 37th Infantry Division while the 43rd Infantry Division gained only a small amount of ground. The Japanese had constructed many pillboxes along the front and on 26 July, the U.S. 103rd Infantry Regiment came up against 74 of these structures in a narrow front. Again, the U.S. troops utilized indirect fire to reduce these obstacles, while infantry attacked armed with flamethrowers, and operating closely alongside Marine tanks. In many cases, the Japanese reoccupied these pillboxes in the darkness; as a result, later the U.S. troops took to ripping the roofs off these structures.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, p. 61Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 203–204 Capture of Munda Point, 22 July – 4 August 1943 Inland, the U.S. troops advanced towards towards Bilbao Hill. In the center of the frontline, the US infantrymen were supported by six tanks from the 10th Defense Battalion that had recently arrived from the Russell Islands,Hammel, The Munda Trail, pp. 108 & 123 and attacked with flamethrowers, small arms and grenades. Two Marine tanks were destroyed in this fighting, while the others were forced to withdraw, and over the course of the next couple of days heavy fighting occurred. Even when pillboxes were overrun, invariably one defender remained to fight to the death.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 204 On the extreme right flank, though, the advancing U.S. troops made steady gains over several days. Here, the advance pushed too far forward, outstripping their supply line and neighboring units, and on 28 July the Japanese 13th Infantry Regiment found a gap in the U.S. line between the 148th and 161st Infantry Regiments, and surrounded a U.S. supply dump. In response, two battalions of the U.S. divisional reserve (169th Infantry Regiment) were committed. Four U.S. rifle companies counterattacked the 200 Japanese troops around the supply dump, restoring the situation while incurring heavy casualties. Meanwhile, the offensive in the south continued towards Shimzu Hill, about from the outer limits of the airfield continued. A change of command of the 43rd Infantry Division took place on 29 July, with Major General John R. Hodge taking over from Hester.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 149 On 30 July, the Japanese commander, Sasaki, ordered a withdrawal closer to the airfield. Shimzu Hill was taken by U.S. forces the following day.Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, pp. 60–61Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 204–205 As the fighting continued, the Japanese medical and resupply systems broke down as the Sasaki's men were reduced to around half strength. On 1 August, elements from the 103rd Infantry Regiment reached the outskirts of the airfield, while the 27th Infantry Regiment, detached from the 25th Infantry Division, was pushed into the line to reinvigorate the final drive. Japanese troops defending the ridges along the Munda Trail hastily withdrew when pressed and by 2 August only limited opposition was provided, except around Bibilo and Kokoengolo Hills. For the Japanese, the situation grew desperate. Communications with Rabaul had been severed and casualties had heavily reduced their fighting elements with many of the senior leaders among the dead or wounded. The advancing U.S. divisions converged around the eastern edges of the airfield on 3 August, and although Sasaki ordered an evacuation that day, Japanese defenders continued to offer resistance around the hills. Throughout 4 August, Japanese pillboxes and foxholes were reduced by U.S. troops attacking with indirect fire support weapons and machine guns.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 93Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, pp. 61–62Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 205–206 After encircling the airfield, US forces captured Bibilo Hill on 4 August.Lofgren, Northern Solomons, p. 23 Fighting alongside Marine tanks and supported by mortars and 37 mm guns, U.S. infantrymen captured the airfield late on 5 August. 172nd Infantry during the fighting around Munda Aftermath After losing the battle for the airfield, Japanese forces began evacuating New Georgia and a large number of troops redeployed to defend nearby Kolombangara,Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 171–172 while others were sent to Bangaa Islet, which was about west of Munda. Initially, Sasaki believed further troops would be sent south from Rabaul to support a counterattack in New Georgia;Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, p. 62 but by the end of the month the Japanese reverted to delaying tactics to enable a withdrawal from the Central Solomons.Rentz, Marines in the Central Solomons, p. 127 The Allies employed the airfield to cover landings on Vella Lavella, and in its campaign as part of Operation Cartwheel to isolate the major Japanese base at Rabaul, New Britain.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 165–167 Casualties during the fighting around Munda amounted to 4,994 U.S. troops killed or wounded from 2 July until the capture of the airfield. Against this, the Japanese lost 4,683 killed, with an unknown wounded over the same period. Meanwhile, several Naval Construction Battalions, including the 24th and 73rd, began repairing the airfield and expanding its capacity. By mid-August, two U.S. Marine fighter squadrons were operating from the airfield in support of operations on Vella Lavella. Throughout this period, U.S. ground forces on New Georgia undertook mopping up operations, advancing beyond Munda. This saw the 27th and 161st Infantry Regiments advance north towards Bairoko. The 27th cleared both Mount Tirokiambo and Mount Bao,Stille, The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville, pp. 56–57 (map) while the 161st closed in on Bairoko, which was secured by 24/25 August. Meanwhile, the 169th and 172nd Infantry Regiments secured Bangaa Islet by 21 August and Arundel Island was captured by U.S. forces in early September.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 167–172, 184 During the Bougainville campaign, commencing in late 1943, over 100 Allied aircraft operated from Munda airfield.

Javanese dance is the dances and art forms that were created and influenced by Javanese culture. Javanese dance movement is controlled, deliberate and refined. Javanese art often displays a finesse, and at the same time a serene composure which is elevated far above everything mundane. Javanese dance is usually associated with courtly, refined and sophisticated culture of the Javanese kratons, such as the bedhaya and srimpi dance. However, in a wider sense, Javanese dance also includes the dances of Javanese commoners and villagers such as ronggeng, tayub, reog, and jaran kepang. Javanese dance and its discipline has different styles and philosophy compared to other Indonesian dance traditions. Unlike vigorous and expressive Balinese dance or cheerful and slightly sensual Sundanese dance, Javanese dance are commonly involving slow movements and graceful poses. Javanese dance have somewhat a meditative quality and tends to be more self-reflective, introspective and more oriented toward self-understanding. Javanese dance is usually associated with Wayang wong, and the palaces of Yogyakarta and Surakarta due to the nature of dance being a pusaka or sacred heirloom from ancestors of the palace rulers. These expressive dances are more than just dances, they are also used for moral education, emotional expression, and spreading of the Javanese culture. Types of Javanese dance Javanese dancer, 1885 Javanese dance reflects the stratified hierarchy of Javanese society, and roughly can be identified within two mainstream of traditions: #Tari kraton (palace dances) #Tari kawula (commoner dances) Tari Kraton The courtly Javanese palace dance is the type of dances that developed, nurtured and fostered by Javanese Kratons, mainly Yogyakarta Sultanate and Surakarta Sunanate, the patrons of Javanese Mataram culture. Javanese sultans are known as the patron and the creator of Javanese court dances. Kraton dances employs sets of rules about certain dance movements, body and hand gestures that requires discipline to learn. Gamelan orchestra is the prerequisite for Javanese court dance performances as well as for other Javanese art forms such as Wayang performances. The serene elegance, slow pace and constrains of its movements gave Javanese dance a meditative traits. Javanese court dances were heavily influenced by Javanese Hindu-Buddhist legacy. As the result the costumes, jewelry and story, often reflects or based on Hindu epic tales of Ramayana and Mahabharata. There are three basic types of courtly Javanese kraton dance: #Beksan putra – These are the dances for men, which serve two purposes: a military close-order drill and highlighting martial skills. Dancers may learn beksan putra dances to familiarize themselves with the movements for narrative dances. #Beksan putri – Putri is the Javanese word for female, and these dances include courtly dances designed for royal events with very precise movements and distinct staging with subtle layers of meaning. Such dances were often used for entertainment or courtship. #Beksan wayang – These are narrative dances from epic poems, and usually are named after the characters in them, usually an alus-style hero and a gagah-style villain. Tari Kawula Also known as Tari Rakyat, it's the popular dances of the commoner. This is the type of Javanese dances that developed in villages or cities that located relatively quite far from Javanese kratons as the center of Javanese palace culture. Kawulo dances is lack in Javanese courtly dance discipline, constraints, and refinements. This type of dance relatively more open and adaptive to local preference as well as foreign influences. Several dance forms function as courtship or social dance such as ronggeng, gandrung and tayub, while others are celebratory dances such as reog and kuda lumping. The movement of social dances, such as ronggeng and tayub are more vigorous and often erotic, closely related to Sundanese jaipongan. Because of the erotic nuances, those who perform this type of dance are sometimes perceived as intentionally being suggestive or even openly advertising sexual favors.

Originally the line was single and the Station house was of two stories with three gable ends facing on to the platform. The line was doubled in 1846 and a second platform contained simply a waiting room. In common with stations built on this line at this time the sidings on either side were accessed by wagon turntables connected by a line across the running lines at right angles to them. The platforms were offset and this line ran between them, with a large goods shed adjacent to the main building. Later a further running line was added in the Peterborough direction and more sidings were added curving away into a new goods yard, using double slips off the running lines Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations.

It took place in the early phase of the New Georgia Campaign in the Solomon Islands during the Pacific War. Prior to the battle, US troops had landed at Rice Anchorage, in the Kula Gulf, on the northern coast of New Georgia, tasked with supporting efforts further south to advance on the airfield at Munda. After the landing, three battalions of United States Marines and United States Army soldiers had begun advancing inland to secure Bairoko Harbor. The approach march saw them advance through dense jungle towards an inlet around the small port of Enogai. A series of minor engagements took place before the main assault. The fighting around Enogai saw a battalion of Marines attack a force of around 400 Japanese, forcing the defending troops to withdraw after a firefight that lasted into the early afternoon. Mopping up operations continued into the following day, after which Enogai was used as a base prior to the attack on Bairoko later in the month. Background=Strategic situation Following the completion of the Guadalcanal campaign in early 1943, the Allied high command began planning the next step in their effort to neutralize the main Japanese base at Rabaul as part of Operation Cartwheel. The advance north through the central Solomon Islands involved a series of operations to secure island bases for shipping and aircraft. Plans for 1943 conceived the capture of New Georgia and then later Bougainville by US troops. Elsewhere, in New Guinea, the Australians would capture Lae and Salamaua and secure Finschafen.Keogh, pp. 287–290Rentz, p. 19 Allied landings in the New Georgias The campaign to secure New Georgia, designated Operation Toenails by US planners, was focused upon securing the airfield at Munda Point, on the western coast of New Georgia island. As part of this effort, several initial landings were undertaken to capture staging areas at Wickham Anchorage and Viru Harbor and an airfield at Segi Point in the southern part of New Georgia, to support the movement of troops and supplies from Guadalcanal. These supplies would be staged through to Rendova, which would be built up as base for further operations in New Georgia focused on securing the airfield at Munda. These preliminary operations began at the end of June 1943.Miller, pp. 70–84Rentz, p. 52 After the initial landings, Rendova was secured quickly. On 2 July, troops from the US 169th and 172nd Infantry Regiments crossed the Blanche Channel to the western coast of New Georgia, landing around Zanana to begin the drive on Munda Point. To support this effort a separate landing group was detached to secure the area around Bairoko on the northern coast.Miller, p. 92 The area was believed by Allied planners to lie on key Japanese lines of communication to support the troops holding the Munda area. Consequently, the Northern Landing Group was tasked with blocking the Munda–Bairoko trail and securing Bairoko Harbor, which provided the sea link with the Japanese base at Vila on Kolombangara to the northwest.Shaw & Kane, pp. 119Miller, pp. 70 & 94–95 Opposing forces Approach to Bairoko, coordinated with move on Enogai The task of landing around Bairoko was given to the Northern Landing Group, under the command of Colonel Harry B. Liversedge.Shaw & Kane, p. 122 (map). This force consisted of one battalion of U.S. Marine Raiders from the 1st Marine Raider Regiment (the 1st Battalion),Rentz p. 26 supported by two United States Army infantry battalions (the 3rd Battalion, 145th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment).Shaw & Kane, pp. 119–120Rentz, p. 26 This force was organized to facilitate quick movement through the jungle. No artillery was assigned to the force, instead fire support would be provided by mortars and machine guns.Shaw & Kane, p. 121 Additionally, only three days of rations were carried by the troops, as US commanders intended upon resupplying over the shore at the small port of Enogai on the Dragons Peninsula, after advancing from the landing beach around the Rice Anchorage.Miller, p. 104 Allied intelligence estimated that there was around 500 Japanese troops in the area; in reality there were 1,100 consisting of 300 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers and 800 Imperial Japanese Navy personnel.Rentz, p. 20 The main unit in the area was Colonel Saburo Okumura's Kure 6th Special Naval Landing Force,Shaw & Kane, p. 134 guarding Enogai.Miller, pp. 101–103 Okumura's unit had arrived around Enogai and Bairoko in March 1942, as part of Japanese efforts to secure airbases on New Georgia to support their operations on Guadalcanal.Rottman, p. 65 Battle Liversedge's force landed at the Rice Anchorage, about past the mouth of the Wharton River, in the Kula Gulf area early on 5 July, having sailed from aboard several high speed transports and minesweepers at Guadalcanal the previous day. The landing force was escorted by a naval group including nine destroyers and three cruisers that were assigned to a covering force and a bombardment force. This force carried out a pre-assault bombardment of Kolombangara and Bairoko around midnight on 4/5 July.Shaw & Kane, pp. 120–121 Prior to the landing, an Australian coastwatcher, Flight Officer John Corrigan, and US Marine Captain Clay Boyd had organized a local labor force to begin clearing the landing beach, as well as a bivouac site and trails from Kula Gulf towards Enogai; they later marked the landing site with canoes and beacons to aid the landing craft and rubber boats that brought the troops ashore. During preliminary operations, one of the covering destroyers, USS Strong, was fatally torpedoed by a Japanese destroyer group operating in the Kula Gulf.Miller, p. 95 Map depicting the US force's advance on Enogai Two shallow sandbars at the mouth of the river briefly held up the landing, but these were overcome by lightening the loads each vessel carried. The landing took place before dawn, and in the darkness about 200 troops from the 148th Infantry Regiment accidentally landed at Kobukobu Inlet instead. It would take several days for these troops to eventually rejoin Liversedge's force; meanwhile, the main landing proceeded largely unopposed, except for artillery fire from Japanese coastal batteries at Enogai. The threat of air attack meant that the unloading process was cut short as dawn approached, and the escort convoy withdrew with a small number of troops and some cargo—including an important high-powered radio—while Liversedge's troops quickly moved inland. After landing, the US troops established a beachhead and supply dump, and set out towards Enogai and Bairoko Harbor. Their objective lay about on a direct route overland; instead, the US troops opted for a more circuitous route, traversing three parallel trails south towards the Giza Giza River.Miller, pp. 94–95Rentz, pp. 96–98 While two companies from the 145th Infantry Regiment held Rice Anchorage,Rentz, pp. 98 & 104 the two other companies of the 145th were assigned as a force reserve as the three US battalions set out. Amidst a heavy downpour, they found the going difficult and were only able to advance through the dense jungle the first day.Morison, p. 157 The trail cleared by Corrigan and Boyd's laborers only extended to the Giza Giza River, from where the advancing troops would have to clear their own path. While US aircraft attacked Japanese guns around Enogai, the advancing troops established a bridgehead on the opposite side of the river, where a defensive harbor was set up overnight.Rentz, pp. 98–99 No engagements occurred during the advance on the first day. The advance continued the following day, but the crossing of the rain-swollen Tamakau River was slowed due to flooding and the lack of bridging equipment. The operation was completed by nightfall on 6 July, after which the Marines and soldiers established a bivouac for the night. The advance towards Enogai and the Munda–Bairoko trail began on 7 July, watched by a platoon of Japanese troops who maintained their distance. While the 148th was ordered to proceed south towards the Munda–Bairoko trail, the Marines and the two companies from 145th, turned northwest to advance on Enogai Inlet via a swamp. The rate of advance remained slow, held up by the terrain, but by the end of the day, the Marines had reached the Enogai Inlet.Miller, p. 101Rentz, p. 99 Over the course three days, the advancing US troops had covered only .Morison, p. 176 The same day, a Marine platoon occupied Maranusa unopposed before advancing towards Triri. Short of the village, they clashed with the Japanese for the first time, killing two and forcing three others to withdraw. As the Marines brought up reinforcements to occupy the village and prepare for a Japanese counterattack, another skirmish took place when the Marine demolition platoon was attacked by a small Japanese force. In response, a Marine rifle company counterattacked, forcing the Japanese to withdraw. Ten Japanese were killed in the action, while three US Marines also died in this action.Miller, pp. 101–102 At this time, Liversedge requested further airstrikes against Enogai via radio, having largely maintained radio silence. Owing to the loss of the high powered radio, attempts to send the request via two medium powered radios were initially unsuccessful before they were relayed by an Army unit in eastern New Georgia to Guadalcanal.Rentz, p. 101Shaw & Kane, p. 125 US casualties being evacuated by seaplane after the fighting around Enogai Troops from the 148th Infantry Regiment occupied blocking positions along the Munda–Bairoko trail on 8 July, while Marines began patrolling operations from Triri, setting several ambushes on the trails towards Enogai and Bairoko. A patrol reported the way through to Enogai clear and Liversedge began to concentrate the companies from the 1st Raiders to carry out an assault on the village. To achieve this, he sent the two companies of the 145th Infantry Regiment from Maranusa—where they were guarding the main US command post—to relieve Company C who had become entangled in a firefight after going to the aid of one of the patrols along the Bairoko trail. In the afternoon, the Marine battalion began its move towards Enogai. After stumbling into a swamp, the Marines were forced to return to Triri. Liversedge's troops were running short of food and their wounded needed evacuation. He was unable to request assistance, though, after his radio was destroyed by a falling tree; as a result, he planned to make another effort to capture Enogai the following day.Miller, p. 102 Meanwhile, heavy fighting took place around the southern block, as 97 Japanese troops attacked the soldiers from the 148th Infantry Regiment along the trail, resulting in at least seven Japanese being killed as well as one US soldier. After 16:00 hours, the Japanese commander, Okumura, launched a counterattack against Trii with 400 troops, falling on the troops from the westernmost company of the 145th Infantry Regiment that were holding the main US command post. This attack achieved some initial success, until a swift counterattack from a Marine platoon repulsed the attack, resulting in 20 Japanese being killed.Rentz, pp. 103–104 On 9 July, US forces began their advance to the mouth of the inlet, moving along higher ground west of the swamp they had run into the day before. In the process, they bypassed several villages, including Maranusa II, Baekineru, and Baevurana, where the Japanese had established strong defensive positions.Rentz, pp. 102–104 While the soldiers held blocking positions to the south along the trial and secured Triri, the Marines launched the main assault on Enogai, beginning their approach from 07:00 hours with three raider companies and a fourth in reserve, supported by a heavy mortar bombardment and long range machine-gun preparatory fire prior to the attack. By 11:00 hours, the advance had reached Leland Lagoon. Around 15:00 hours, two Japanese machine guns opened up on the advancing Marines, prompting them to shake out with Companies A, B and C abreast and D in reserve. Attacking without indirect fire support, the Marines advanced as the Japanese reinforced Enogai. The fighting continued throughout the afternoon, with the Marines advancing cautiously over against stiff resistance, before the US commander decided to establish a night harbor. By this time only a small group of Japanese defenders remained, with US troops having been held up short of Enogai Point.Rentz, pp. 102–106Shaw & Kane, pp. 123–130 Throughout the night, Liversedge made plans for an aerial resupply as his troops consumed the last of their combat rations, while the wounded—around 28 men—were treated in makeshift hospitals by doctors and corpsmen. The following day, several patrols were sent out before the US attack recommenced at 07:00 hours. At this time, three companies from the 1st Marine Raider Regiment were again committed, with one in reserve, while 60 mm mortars and plunging fire from machine guns provided fire support. Met by desultory small arms and light machine gun fire, one company captured Baekineru, while another, reinforced from reserve elements, advanced towards the ocean around Enogai Point. Japanese defensive fire intensified. Captured machine guns were then turned against their previous operators as the defenders began to withdraw, while US mortarmen began firing on the Japanese line of retreat from the high ground overlooking the village. By mid-afternoon, the Marines had overcome the main Japanese defense, although they continued to experience harassing fire as they established defensive positions along the beach.Miller, p. 103Rentz, pp. 104–108Shaw & Kane, p. 128 Marines patrolling around Enogai in August 1943 Aftermath US casualties amounted to 47 killed, 4 missing (presumed dead), and 74 wounded, while between 150 and 350 Japanese were estimated to have been killed. Four Japanese 140 mm coastal guns were captured, along with three antiaircraft guns and various other small arms and equipment.Shaw & Kane, p. 129 The Marines had been unable to carry full rations during the approach and consequently had to wait until 10 July for air dropped supplies to be brought forward to them from Triri; around 120 local laborers were used to carry rations forward to troops occupying the blocking positions, while elements of the 145th Infantry Regiment also carried out portage tasks, supporting the Marines around Enogai. Japanese air attacks on Enogai began on 11 July, killing three and wounding 15. They then became an almost daily occurrence.Rentz, p. 107 Casualties from the battle were evacuated by seaplane on 11 July; the process was interrupted when several Japanese fighters attacked the seaplanes on the water. Nevertheless, the damage was light and the evacuation proceeded, with the wounded being flown to Tulagi. While the bulk of the Japanese had withdrawn, US troops carried out mopping up operations throughout 11 July. Following the capture of Enogai, Liversedge's force worked to improve the area's defenses, pressing several captured coastal guns into service, as well as other captured equipment including searchlights, machine guns, and mortars to secure the inlet. Elsewhere, to interdict Japanese reinforcements moving towards Munda, the roadblock that had been established about inland along the Munda–Bairoko trail, was held by US Army troops from 8 to 17 July until it was abandoned due to supply problems, increasing illness and tactical concerns.Miller, pp. 103–104 Meanwhile, the troops around Enogai undertook patrolling operations towards Bairoko Harbor, during which there were only a few minor skirmishes.Shaw & Kane, p. 133 On 20 July, Liversedge then carried out an unsuccessful follow-up attack on nearby Bairoko.Miller, pp. 127–131 After this, US forces remained in the Enogai area until the end of the New Georgia Campaign, undertaking patrols and gathering intelligence regarding Japanese reinforcements moving towards the Munda area.Miller, p. 144 NotesReferences   Further reading     *- Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War.

The strike began on November 1, 1979,Flamholtz and Randle, Changing the Game: Organizational Transformations of the First, Second, and Third Kinds, 1998. and ended after 172 days on April 20, 1980.Ring, \\"McCardell's Reign as IH Boss Wasn't Dull,\\" Quad Cities Dispatch, July 16, 2008. As of May 2008, it was the fourth-longest strike of national importance ever held by the UAW.Morath, \\"Axle Strike Mirrors Pain of 1970 Walkout at GM,\\" Detroit News, May 3, 2008. Background=Previous bargaining history The International Harvester logo. The UAW first negotiated a master contract with International Harvester in 1950. At the time, there was no mandatory overtime and both management and the union believed that the company could not request mandatory overtime.Loomis, \\"The Strike That Rained on Archie McCardell's Parade,\\" Fortune, May 19, 1980. The 1950 master contract also codified an existing practice whereby a worker could transfer to any other job in the company provided he or she was the most senior applicant for the position. During the 1958 contract renewal talks, IH attempted to restrict job transfer rights. The union struck for nine weeks, and IH dropped the demand in exchange for other concessions. Between 1961 and 1976, four of the six three-year contracts were signed only after the union struck—although each of the strikes was short, lasting from two hours to two-and-a-half weeks. There were also a large number (more than 100) wildcat strikes during this period. After a 15-day strike in 1973, the union agreed to include a side letter into the contract in which the union agreed to encourage employees to voluntarily agree to work overtime (with advance notice, and only up to seven Saturdays a year)—although few employees ever volunteered. By the late 1970s, International Harvester had come to believe that unlimited transfer rights were being abused and creating productivity problems. The company also instituted a new disciplinary program to crack down on wildcat strikes, and outlasted one UAW local when it engaged in a five-week-long wildcat strike in 1978 in an attempt to have the program withdrawn. McCardell takes over In 1979, International Harvester was the fourth-largest company in the United States.Zimmerman, The Turnaround Experience: Real-World Lessons in Revitalizing Corporations, 1991. Archie McCardell was appointed president and chief operating officer of International Harvester in August 1977, named chief executive officer in January 1978, and chairman of the board in June 1979.Martin, \\"Archie McCardell, Harvester Chief Who Clashed With Union, Dies at 81,\\" New York Times, July 16, 2008. He was charged with shaking up the family-run company to increase profitability.\\"Hard Times at Harvester,\\" Time, May 25, 1981. He received a then-exorbitant salary of $460,000 (making him one of the highest-paid CEOs in the country), a $1.5 million signing bonus and a $1.8 million loan at 6 percent interest.The loan was to be used to buy Harvester stock. The company promised to forgive the loan if McCardell increased International Harvester's financial performance beyond the average of its six main competitors. \\"Hard Times at Harvester,\\" Time, May 25, 1981. He instituted an aggressive cost-cutting program which immediately cut spending by $640 million and a modernization program which poured $879 million over three years into the company's plants. His actions boosted market share, and led to record sales of $8.4 billion and record profits of $370 million (up from $203 million). Despite McCardell's actions, IH's profit margins were still only half those of competitors like Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Company.\\"International Harvester: The Strike Hurts,\\" The Economist, March 8, 1980. Among the many changes McCardell made was to fire 11,000 of the company's 15,000 mid- and upper-level managers, whom McCardell felt were too close to UAW shop stewards.Friedman, \\"The Culture of Mediation: Private Understandings in the Context of Public Conflict,\\" in Hidden Conflict in Organizations: Uncovering Behind-the-Scenes Disputes, 1991. McCardell took personal control of IH's labor relations, and appointed a new vice president of human resources, W. Grant Chandler (who was to assist McCardell in all union negotiations). McCardell's actions stripped the company of nearly all its experienced labor negotiators, and those who remained were mostly ignored during the upcoming round of negotiations. McCardell and Chandler had little labor relations experience, however, and none in heavy manufacturing or in negotiating with the UAW. Early negotiations Negotiations opened on August 9, 1979, in Chicago, Illinois.\\"Farm Machinery Firms And UAW Open Talks On Master Contracts,\\" Wall Street Journal, August 10, 1979. UAW International Vice President Pat Greathouse and two veteran IH negotiators—Art Shy, and Cletus Williams—led a union bargaining team composed of 20 representatives from 51 IH local unions.Slater, \\"Tentative Agreement Believed Near In International Harvester Strike,\\" Associated Press, March 19, 1980. Among the proposed changes to the contract that the union proposed was that the union contract be automatically extended to any new plants opened by International Harvester—essentially allowing the union to organize new workers without holding an election. Instead of a similar long list of demands (which the company had traditionally countered with in the past), Chandler gave the union only seven demands and advised it that these proposals must be dealt with, strike or no strike. The proposals were aimed at largely ending job transfers and seniority, adding five shifts a week, and instituting a mandatory overtime scheme; the company claimed it had lost $1.3 billion over the previous three years over these issues. Many companies in turnaround seek to improve product design and production processes, and managerial expertise before seeking labor concessions. But McCardell concluded that the fastest way to achieve cost savings was to persuade workers to accept work rules changes which would have cost employees $100 million. Surprisingly, however, IH agreed to match the pay increase pattern set earlier in the year by automobile manufacturers in Detroit.Slater, \\"Council Orders More Talks in 140-Day Strike,\\" Associated Press, March 20, 1980.\\"In Midst of Joblessness, A Strike Over Too Much Work,\\" U.S. News & World Report,\\" April 21, 1980. Despite the concession, these early negotiations did not go well. McCardell and Chandler were inexperienced negotiatiors, not picking up on the private signals the union sent and did not understand the importance of the signals when they did become aware of them. Even company-side negotiators complained about the inexperience of McCardell and Chandler, arguing that this inexperience lessened the company's ability to divine the union's real bargaining positions. When McCardell and Chandler were not at the bargaining table, negotiators who were present had no real authority to bargain on behalf of the company. Combined, these two factors significantly hindered IH's bargaining abilities. As one scholar pointed out: \\"There was no sense that the company negotiators had the capacity to understand the industry, the union's positions, or the politics that these leaders faced; neither were these negotiators truly free to develop that understanding.\\"Friedman, \\"The Culture of Mediation: Private Understandings in the Context of Public Conflict,\\" in Hidden Conflict in Organizations: Uncovering Behind-the-Scenes Disputes, 1991, p. 156.. Other company actions unintentionally hardened negotiating positions and decreased trust between the two parties. The company moved the negotiations out of a neutral local hotel and into management conference rooms, limited informal side conversations (which had been used in the past to explore compromises), refused to build social ties with the union bargainers, refused to informally signal their true intentions, and ignored symbolic issues (one IH negotiator wore a silk suit to negotiations, which offended the blue-collar negotiators). International Harvester also unintentionally disempowered the union negotiators, making it harder for them to agree to company demands. For example, the company repeatedly went public with its bargaining proposals, which made it harder for company negotiators to back down later and reach compromises. The company's \\"match the pay pattern\\" announcement also had the effect of depriving union leaders of the ability to claim a \\"win\\" in negotiations by claiming they had achieved a pay raise—making it harder for union negotiators to \\"sell\\" more hard-to-swallow compromises later, and forcing the union to entrench itself to achieve gains in other areas. The talks recessed after just one day.\\"Strikes, Settlements, Employees: Int'l. Harvester,\\" Toronto Globe and Mail, August 22, 1979. Less than a week later, International Harvester reported on August 15, 1979, record sales and earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1979.\\"International Harvester,\\" Associated Press, August 16, 1979. Year-to- year net earnings for the third quarter rose $1.12 per share to $2.19, and the year-to-year third quarter dividend raised 5 cents to 62.5 cents. Net income for the quarter rose to $67.91 million, an 89 percent increase over the same period last year, and net income for the first three quarters of the year was $221.9 million, a 95 percent increase over the previous year. The company said prospects for the final quarter also looked strong.\\"Stock Prices Post Declines in Hectic New York Trading,\\" \\"Toronto Globe and Mail,\\" August 17, 1979. Bargaining resumed on August 21, 1979. International Harvester's behavior at and away from the bargaining table, coupled with the company's exceedingly positive economic news, hardened the UAW's bargaining position. On September 14, 1979, the UAW said it would strike all heavy-equipment manufacturers it was negotiating with if new collective bargaining agreements were not reached.\\"Domestic News,\\" Associated Press, September 15, 1979; \\"U.A.W. Strike Threat Affects Big 3 Makers of Farm Implements,\\" United Press International, September 16, 1979. The UAW's contract at International Harvester expired on October 1, 1979. But despite the union's more rigid stands, a council of all 51 IH local unions agreed to extend the contract on a day-to-day basis as negotiations continued.\\"Domestic News,\\" Associated Press, September 28, 1979.—a decision opposed by the international union. In late October, IH received mixed signals about the Auto Workers' intentions and capabilities. On October 18, the union reached a new three-year agreement with Deere & Co. after an 18-day strike by 31,000 employees, while at the same time 23,000 of Caterpillar's 40,000 workers engaged in a wildcat strike to protest the slow pace of negotiations at that company.\\"Domestic News,\\" Associated Press, October 19, 1979. Six days later, the union made it clear it would strike IH if no agreement was reached, but IH officials merely reiterated that their seven demands must be met.\\"Domestic News,\\" Associated Press, October 25, 1979. Another 17,000 Caterpillar workers struck on October 28, and IH officials suggested that the UAW would be too financially exhausted and organizationally stretched too thin to engage in a third strike.\\"Domestic News,\\" Associated Press, October 29, 1979. International Harvester refused to budge on its demand for mandatory overtime.\\"Domestic News,\\" Associated Press, October 31, 1979. Strike The union did strike, however. On November 1, 1979, 35,000 UAW workers (36 percent of International Harvester's workforce)\\"International Harvester: When Cost-Cutting Threatens the Future,\\" Business Week, February 11, 1980. at 21 plants in eight states—Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas—struck International Harvester at noon rather than accept the new work rules and mandatory overtime provisions.\\"Domestic News,\\" Associated Press, November 1, 1979; \\"Background of 9-State Walkout,\\" Chicago Tribune, February 3, 1980. But McCardell was not alarmed, seeing the strike as a way to challenge the union's power in the workplace and as an opportunity to improve efficiency by regaining concessions the company had made in the past. For nearly a month, no talks were held. The two sides met briefly on Monday, November 26, for roughly an hour, but no progress was made.\\"Business News,\\" Associated Press, November 27, 1979. Thereafter, the union stepped up its pressure on the company.\\"Union Shifts Contract Drive to International Harvester,\\" Associated Press, December 13, 1979. Bargaining reopened on December 13.\\"Contract Talks Resume.\\" Associated Press. December 14, 1979. As the talks resumed, the UAW settled the strike at Caterpillar, ending what was then the longest strike in history against that heavy-equipment manufacturer.\\"Agreement at Caterpillar,\\" Associated Press, December 16, 1979; \\"Caterpillar Workers Back at Work,\\" Associated Press, December 20, 1979. Nonetheless, talks broke off December 15, the same day the Caterpillar strike ended.Jelinek, \\"Strike Could Lead to Loss, Company Says,\\" Associated Press, January 11, 1980. Days later, International Harvester announced a year-to-year increase of 98 percent in its profits for the entire fiscal year. Yearly earnings reached a record $369.9 million, and sales rose a 25.9 percent to reach a record $8.4 billion.\\"International Harvester Posts 98% Profit Gains.\\" Washington Post. December 21, 1979. Net income nearly doubled to $12.01 a share (up from $6.14 a share). But on January 10, 1980, the company said that losses in the first quarter of the year (November 1979 to January 1980) could be as high as $225 million (or 10 percent of the company's shareholders' equity) if the strike continued.\\"Harvester Expects $225 Million Loss in Quarter,\\" Chicago Tribune, January 12, 1980. To help weather the strike, International Harvester's top 25 officers took 20 percent salary cuts, travel expenses were curtailed, meetings were cancelled or moved to company offices, the budget for the annual stockholders' meeting scaled back, advertising spending curtailed, capital spending slashed by $100 million (to $400 million), and a new line of credit established to provide access to emergency funds (if needed).\\"Harvester Hangs Tough,\\" Business Week, January 28, 1980. McCardell, however, vowed to continue to seek agreement on the company's seven demands. In mid-December 1979, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette quoted an internal International Harvester memorandum (written in January 1979) in which the company appeared to advocate manufacturing plant decentralization as part of a plan to break the union. The memo specifically mentioned a new IH plant to be built in Wagoner, Oklahoma (a right-to-work state) which would eliminate unionized jobs at the company's Fort Wayne plant. The memo said the Wagoner plant was only the first step in a scheme to slowly dismantle the Fort Wayne plant. The memo outraged the union, which felt the company had intended to bargain in bad faith over its contract extension proposal. The company's tendency to go public with negotiating positions led to further entrenchment on both sides, and no talks were scheduled for most of January. While International Harvester was forced to cut costs, the United Auto Workers improved its financial position. On January 30, 1980, the union gave striking workers a $15-a-week across-the-board increase in strike benefits, raising the benefit to $55 a week for a single worker and $65 a week for married workers with dependents.\\"Union Raises Strike Benefits,\\" Associated Press, January 31, 1980. The company and union resumed talks on February 4, 1980, but the discussions ended after just one day.\\"Harvester-UAW Talks Stall Again,\\" Associated Press, February 5, 1980. IH modified its overtime proposal to require worker consent, and asked the union to create a group of part-time employees who would be mandated to work overtime when not enough regulartime employees could be found to work. The union rejected the proposal without explanation and walked out of the talks.\\"International Harvester Official Says Next Move Up to Union,\\" Associated Press, February 11, 1980. The strike, by now the longest in International Harvester's history as well as the longest in UAW history (surpassing the old record of 117 days), resumed and the union threatened to stay on the picket line until March if necessary. Industry analysts worried that IH would begin to lose market share as its inventories dropped. As the annual company shareholders' meeting approached, the union accused International Harvester of attempting to prevent union members' attendance. The United Auto Workers, which owned six shares of Harvester stock, accused the company of deliberately selecting a meeting hall which was too small to accommodate the number of union members who would be voting those shares and issuing too-few tickets to permit admission for the union members.\\"UAW Wants Seats at International Harvester Annual Meeting,\\" Associated Press, February 19, 1980. The union filed an injunction in United States district court to force International Harvester to admit its members. Days before the shareholder meeting, International Harvester reported a first- quarter loss of $222.2 million.\\"Harvester Posts Loss,\\" New York Times, February 21, 1980. The company also admitted that unfilled orders of $4.2 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year earlier, and attributed the loss and backlog to the effects of the strike. Despite the loss, the company still paid a dividend of 62.5 cents a share for the quarter.Robbins, \\"Labor Rift Marks Harvester Meeting,\\" New York Times, February 22, 1980.\\"Harvester to Pay Dividend Despite Loss,\\" Associated Press, February 22, 1980. The annual shareholders' meeting, held at the First Chicago Center in Chicago on February 21, was described by the press as \\"turbulent.\\" On February 20, the union obtained a court order requiring International Harvester to set up closed- circuit television facilities so members of the UAW and other shareholders could observe the meeting. The overflow room was at a hotel several blocks away. But when the meeting opened with about 200 seats still empty, McCardell delayed proceedings for an hour as 175 UAW members were brought from the hotel to the First Chicago Center. The UAW bitterly attacked McCardell throughout the proceedings. Cletus Williams, chairman of the UAW's negotiating committee, accused McCardell of manipulating the shareholders' meeting so that many UAW members didn't know they could attend until it was too late. Despite the rancorous shareholders' meeting, bargainers resumed talks that same day.\\"UAW and Harvester In Strike Talks After Two-Month Lull,\\" Associated Press, February 22, 1980. IH once more altered its overtime proposal, suggesting that employees be required to work up to 14 Saturdays a year and establishing a voluntary pool of part-time workers to fill in shifts when not enough full- time workers volunteered to work a particular Saturday shift.Slater, \\"UAW vs. International Harvester,\\" Associated Press, March 6, 1980. But the company withdrew its proposal when the union declared its opposition. IH's financial situation worsened on March 6, 1980, when Moody's Investors Services downgraded the company's short-term bond credit rating from Prime 1 to Prime 2.\\"Harvester Credit Unit's Commercial Paper Given a Lower Rating,\\" Wall Street Journal, March 7, 1980.\\"Market Perspective: Int'l. Harvester,\\" Toronto Globe and Mail, March 8, 1980. The company estimated the downgrade would cost it $4 million in profits by the end of the fiscal year. In yet another cost-cutting move, 8,000 of the company's 10,000 salaried and management employees were forced to take a week's vacation due to low workloads.\\"International Harvester Negotiations Turn to National Issues,\\" Associated Press, March 7, 1980. Rumors of yet another management pay cut came amid signs that the company was planning to sell its construction equipment business to raise money. But talks did not break off after resuming during the annual shareholder's meeting. Mounting losses and the arrival of farm implement sales season kept the company at the bargaining table and led to agreements on a short-term layoff provision and the job-transfer issue.Weiner, \\"Settling Harvester Strike Gains Urgency As Losses Mount, Big Sales Season Nears,\\" Wall Street Journal, March 12, 1980. Negotiators agreed to negotiate over local matters affecting each plant and settle these before returning to the more contentious national issues. Six local unions quickly settled their local issues. On March 18, 1980, negotiators for both sides announced they had reached a tentative agreement on the mandatory overtime issue. According to the Associated Press, full-time workers and retirees could volunteer to become part of a special overtime pool which could be drawn from to fill vacant weekend work shifts. Seniority, holiday pay and the ability of piece workers to go home after fulfilling their quotas were still outstanding.There is disagreement over whether a tentative agreement on job transfers was reached in mid-March. One source says that an agreement was negotiated (see \\"International Harvester Negotiations Turn to National Issues,\\" Associated Press, March 7, 1980). However, another quoted a union official as saying that the job transfer issue was still outstanding as of March 18 (see Slater, \\"Tentative Agreement Believed Near In International Harvester Strike,\\" Associated Press, March 19, 1980). Forty-two locals had also settled their local issues contracts during the previous week, leaving only six large locals with outstanding agreements. Amid calls to submit the unfinished tentative agreements to the membership for ratification and halt the strike, the 300 members of the International Harvester council of 51 local unions overwhelmingly rejected any such proposals.\\"International Harvester and Strikers Halt Talks,\\" New York Times, March 20, 1980. Because the job transfer, new plant contract extension, and the piece worker issues were all still outstanding,\\"Six Locals Said to Hold Key to Strike,\\" Associated Press, March 21, 1980. the council felt it could not recommend ratification. With six of IH's largest local unions still negotiating, International vice president Pat Greathouse announced that the UAW was breaking off talks at the national level in order to focus on these local contracts. The company agreed, feeling the six large locals—located in East Moline and Rock Island, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Springfield, Ohio; and Louisville, Kentucky—were \\"the key\\" to ending the strike. The council's decision not to recommend ratification lead to a break in the UAW's hierarchy. The day after the decision, Cletus Williams, chairman of the UAW bargaining council, announced that his union—Local 1357 in Canton, Illinois—would take a non-binding vote on the unfinished contract by the end of the weekend.\\"At Least Two Locals Considering Non-Binding Vote,\\" Associated Press, March 21, 1980. But on Sunday, March 22, 1980, members of Local 1357 rejected Williams' plan to conduct a non-binding vote.\\"Harvester Local Rejects Ballot,\\" Associated Press, March 23, 1980. Although the East Moline and Rock Island locals settled their local contracts in the next week, local issue bargaining collapsed after three days.\\"Talks Break Off Again,\\" Associated Press, April 4, 1980. The job transfer issue prevented resolution of the remaining four local contracts. The company believed that if these four local contracts could be settled, the strike would end. Company and union negotiators recommitted themselves to the bargaining process, and an agreement was reached at three more plants the following week\\"UAW Leader Predicts Harvester Strike Settlement Soon,\\" Associated Press, April 14, 1980.\\"Three UAW Locals Still At Odds With International Harvester,\\" Associated Press, April 11, 1980. The final plant settled its local contact on April 14.\\"International Harvester Strike Close to Settlement,\\" Associated Press, April 15, 1980. National contract talks resumed the following day.\\"Harvester Contract Talks Resume on Master Agreement,\\" Associated Press, April 16, 1980. End of the strike After two days of bargaining, International Harvester and the United Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement on the national master contract on April 16, 1980.\\"Harvester, UAW Reach Tentative Agreement,\\" Associated Press, April 17, 1980; \\"Harvester, UAW Reach Agreement,\\" Chicago Tribune, April 18, 1980; \\"UAW and Farm Machinery Maker Reach Tentative Pact,\\" Associated Press, April 18, 1980. The UAW ratified the three-year contract by a vote of 15,494 in favor and 3,877 against on April 19, 1980.\\"Harvester Readies Start-up After Strike\\" Associated Press, April 20, 1980. Local 1309 in Rock Island, Ill., and Local 1077 in Shadyside, Ohio, rejected the master agreement apparently because they disagreed with the plan to gradually resume work; those locals remained independently on strike.\\"Workers End Six-Month Walkout,\\" Associated Press, April 21, 1980. The agreement on mandatory overtime provided for little more than the 1973 side letter had already gained for the company. The contentious issue of limitations on the number and type of job transfers was dropped from the master contract and addressed to varying degrees in plant-level agreements. Limitations varied widely. In one plant, employees could make no more than five transfer requests at one time (files would be purged every six months), there were no restrictions on transfers to higher-paying jobs, and lateral and downward transfer requests were limited to six a year. At other plants, a few stricter limitations were set, such as limiting transfers to one every 90 days. But industry analysts agreed that these were marginal gains. IH also agreed to extend the union contract to only one new plant. The pact only covered the proposed facility in Wagoner, Okla. While union members would be given preference for jobs at Wagoner, they would lose their seniority and would have to accept the Wagoner plant's pay and fringe benefits (which remained to be negotiated). UAW chief negotiator Pat Greathouse called the contract an \\"overwhelming victory\\" for UAW members.\\"UAW Bargainer Hails Pact With Harvester,\\" Associated Press, April 18, 1980. Nearly all independent commentators saw the agreement as a losing proposition for International Harvester. The company had incurred deep financial costs, lost market share, and achieved none of its key demands despite McCardell's assertions that the proposals were critical to the company's success.\\"Harvester Falls Flat On Its Bargaining Goals,\\" Business Week, April 7, 1980.\\"A Long Strike Yields Little for Harvester,\\" Business Week, May 5, 1980. \\"[T]here is no question the company is the big loser in this one,\\" one Wall Street analyst said. The strike lasted 172 days, at the time making it (at the time) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history. International Harvester made key errors—including using inexperienced negotiators, going public with bargaining demands, and attacking key union issues such as seniority and the lack of mandatory overtime without giving itself room to negotiate—which greatly prolonged the strike.Williams, \\"Long Strike Is Called Key McCardell Error,\\" New York Times, May 4, 1982. The seeming arrogance of top company officials is considered by many to be a serious strategic error. Company officials seemed surprised that the union could hold out for any length of time, and McCardell appeared to assume that the international union staff (not rank and file members) were pushing for a strike. Aftermath A 1979 International Harvester Scout. IH ended production of the Scout in October, 1980 due to lack of funds to make changes needed for 1981. An attempt was made to sell the Scout to Texas investors, but this fell through. International Harvester incurred significant delays in resuming operations. Plants in Rock Island and East Moline took several weeks to resume work.\\"Harvester Resumes Output in Louisville As Pacts Are Cleared,\\" Wall Street Journal, May 6, 1980. Several small UAW-represented craft unions which were not part of the master contract talks continued to strike at IH's Louisville plant. The large blue-collar locals refused to cross the picket line (which was their right under the contract), keeping the plant shut. The strike severely impacted the company's financial status. International Harvester lost $257.2 million in the second quarter, for a total of $479.4 million in the first half of the year, while sales slid 47.3 percent.\\"International Harvester Reports $257 Million Loss,\\" Associated Press, May 15, 1980. The company confirmed earlier rumors and put its Scout utility vehicle division up for sale to help cover the losses, and by the end of April 1980 was forced to take out loans which increased its short-term debt from $442 million to a staggering $1 billion.\\"Harvester and A Unit Arrange $420 Million In Bank Credit Lines,\\" Wall Street Journal, April 28, 1980. International Harvester never recovered from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. Rising interest rates, demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its lenders to refinance $4.15 billion of its debt in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. On January 20, 1982, the UAW rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW opened negotiations in March 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 1979-1980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years. On May 3, 1982, one day after the UAW ratified the concessionary contract, Archie McCardell was fired by International Harvester. Although McCardell asserted he had resigned, industry and press observers said that he was fired. Time reported that the company's 16-member board of directors met in a two-hour meeting over the weekend.\\"Goodbye, Archie,\\" Time, May 17, 1982. Pushed by the company's debtor banks, the board finally agreed to fire McCardell. \\"The real wonder was that McCardell had not been ousted much earlier,\\" Time said. The company's downard financial spiral continued. For fiscal year 1980, 1981, and 1982, International Harvester incurred a combined three-year loss of $2.4 billion—the largest such three-year loss for any American company in history at the time.Gilson, Creating Value Through Corporate Restructuring: Case Studies in Bankruptcies, Buyouts, and Breakups, 2001. International Harvester sold its farm equipment division to Tenneco in 1985, and changed its name in 1986 to Navistar International.

History The construction of the synagogue lasted from 1925 till 1927. The funding was due to Jews from Monastir in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, chiefly by Ida Aroesti, in the memory of her late husband Isaac, and the families Camhi, Joseph Nahmias, Massot, Barouch, Halevi, Israel, Calderon, Faradji, and Meir. The consecration by the locum tenens Chief Rabbi of Thessaloniki, Haim Raphael Habib, took place on the 27th Eloul, 5687 (September, 24th, 1927). These families have fled Monastir during the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) and World War I (1914-1918) and established themselves in Thessaloniki creating their own kehila (community) within the greater Jewish Community.

During World War II, the synagogue was saved by being requisitioned by the Red Cross. In June 1978, the structure of the building was severely damaged by an earthquake.

SH 392's western terminus is at a junction with U.S. Route 287 (US 287) south of Fort Collins and proceeds eastward. It intersects Interstate 25 (I-25) at Exit 262 and continues east through the towns of Windsor and Lucerne. The highway continues northeast and serves several small towns. The highway nominally ends north of Briggsdale at SH 14 where it becomes Weld County Road 77 (CR 77). Route description The route begins at US 287 south of Fort Collins, Colorado along Robert Benson Lake. The road then intersects CR 13 and CR 11, where it briefly enters Redmond before entering the Fossil Creek Regional Open Space, along which is located the Fossil Creek Reservoir. As the road continues eastward through the park, it becomes the southern boundary before interchanging with I-25. East of I-25, the road briefly continues through farmland before crossing the Larimer/Weld county line. Afterwards, it meets SH 257 in Windsor, nearing Windsor Lake. The road then continues through rectangularly shaped fields before meeting US 85, where it curves slightly southeastward. As the road continues eastward, the fields become circular, and the road turns slightly northeastward. The surrounding land then becomes barren grassland as the road abruptly turns eastward then sharply northward. The road then meets its terminus several miles later at SH 14 in Briggsdale. History The route was established in 1949, where it began at SH 257 in Windsor and continued east to Barnesville. The road was then paved entirely by 1958, then extended to today's I-25 in 1960. The route was then extended east to Cornish; this section was paved by 1977. The route was then extended to its current terminus at Briggsdale at SH 14 the next year.

He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1951 and retired from active duty in 1987.  Experience  Vice Admiral Metcalf had extensive leadership and operational experience in both sea and shore assignments. He held sea commands in each grade, Lieutenant through Vice Admiral. Among his early commands was the USS King County which fired the Regulus II, the forerunner of the present day cruise missiles. He commanded the USS Westchester County, which made the first combat landing in Vietnam. He was in command of all the surface ships during the final evacuation of U.S. forces from Vietnam. Other Sea commands have been Commanding Officer of the USS Bradley, Commander Destroyer Squadron 33, Commander Naval Surface Group Mid – Pacific, Commander Destroyer Group Eight and Battle Group Two and Commander Second Fleet / Commander NATO Strike Fleet Atlantic / Commander Joint Task Force 120. He was the Operational Commander of all U.S. Forces during the successful campaign to rescue U.S. Citizens in the Invasion of Grenada. Metcalf's last active duty assignment was the Deputy Chief of Staff of Naval Operations for Surface Warfare. During this assignment he developed the concept of \\"revolution at sea\\" and the triad \\"up out and down\\" for missile deterrence. Other assignment ashore have included Instructor at the U.S. Naval Academy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense at the Advanced Research and Development Center in Bangkok, Thailand. In the office of the Chief of Naval Operations he served in a number of positions: Head of the planning Branch of the Programming Division, Deputy Assistant Chief of Naval Personnel for Personnel Planning and Programming and as Director of the General Planning and Programming Division.  Memberships  Metcalf was a member of numerous boards: The Navy Federal Credit Union, the United States Naval Academy Foundation, and the Board of Directors of the Navy Mutual Aid Association. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the USS Constitution Museum. He was the District Chairman of the Potomac Division of National Academy of Sciences Board. He was also a Member of vestry of St. Patrick's Episcopal Church in NW Washington D.C.  Awards  Metcalf wore the Distinguished Service Medal with two gold stars, Bronze Star Medal with Combat V and gold star, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Meritorious Service Medal and Meritorious Unit Commendation. Metcalf is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, Operations Analysis Curriculum and the U.S. Army War College. War Souvenir Controversy At the conclusion of active combat operations following the Invasion of Grenada, Metcalf and several of his senior aides were caught attempting to bring captured Soviet-made AK-47s back to the US as war souvenirs, in violation of both military regulations and US customs law. Twenty-four AK-47s, along with 24 magazines, were seized by customs agents from the Vice Admiral's plane at Norfolk Naval Air Station, VA when Metcalf and his officers were returning from the Grenada theater. As a direct result of intervention by President Ronald Reagan, Metcalf received only a caution from the Navy regarding the incident, and it did not prevent him from later being assigned as Deputy Chief of Staff of Naval Operations for Surface Warfare. Press accounts at the time noted that in the same conflict, six enlisted personnel and one junior officer, of which two were Marines and five were soldiers from the 82nd Airborne, all received reduction in rank, dishonorable discharges and at least one year of prison time for the same offense.AP, February 8, 1985, NY Times Grenada Gun Case: Jail For 7 But Not Admiral  References  Category:1927 births Category:2007 deaths Category:United States Navy admirals Category:People from Holyoke, Massachusetts Category:United States Naval Academy alumni ","title":"Joseph Metcalf III"},{"id":"18653978","text":"Cygnet Cinema is located at 16 Preston Street, Como, Western Australia. It was the first purpose built sound cinema in the suburbs immediately south of the city in the inter-war period. The Cygnet Cinema opened in 1938 and was built by local identity and film entrepreneur James Stiles. It is an excellent example of the art deco style of architect William Leighton and is included on the State's Heritage Register. History The Cygnet Theatre, built in 1938 for James Stiles of the Grand Theatre Company, was originally named the Como Theatre. Formerly a real estate agent, Stiles moved into the cinema industry to save one of his assets, Grand Theatre, which faced ruin in the wake of the stock market crash in 1929. With the boom in cheap entertainment, the Grand Theatre Company soon became a very successful company. In 1938, Stiles managed to secure a ten-year lease on Piccadilly Theatre, modernised his existing cinemas and built Como Theatre. In the late 1930s South Perth had developed as a desirable, respectable riverside suburb. Como Beach was a popular recreation area for families, and a ferry service to the city left from the Como jetty at the bottom end of Preston Street. The 1930s were also a boom period for entertainment. Attending the cinema was a popular pastime and an escape from the poverty of the Depression. A number of cinemas were built, not only in the city centres of Perth or Fremantle, but also in the suburbs. The Cygnet Theatre was not the first cinema in the South Perth area. It was preceded by the picture shows held twice weekly at the Swan Street Hall (1922), the Gaiety Picture Theatre on the corner of Coode and Angelo Streets (1926) and the Hurlingham Picture Theatre on Canning Highway (1933). The Gaiety and Hurlingham were still in operation when the Como Theatre opened in 1938 as the most modern and up-to-date-cinema in the district, screening \\"talkies\\" for the first time. The Como Theatre was officially opened on 4 March 1938, by the Chairman of the South Perth Road Board, G.V. Abjornson. It was designed by William T. Leighton, the well known Inter-War architect, and built by W H Ralph and Sons. In the late 1930s Leighton secured a reputation as a leading cinema designer for his work on several Perth cinemas, including the Piccadilly Theatre and Arcade, the Windsor Theatre in Nedlands, and the Astor Theatre in Mount Lawley. He was also behind the refurbishment of the Royal Theatre and Grand Theatre. Como Theatre originally had both an indoor auditorium and an outdoor picture garden, which was serviced by one mechanised 'bio box'. The tram and ferry services brought people from outside the area to the Cinema. The theatre was renamed the Cygnet Theatre in the 1960s to associate it with the Festival of Perth's black swan logo. Despite the name change, the original Broadway face type lettering stating The Como Theatre around the 'bio box' still exists. Although no longer a Festival of Perth venue, the Cygnet Cinema continues to successfully operate as a suburban cinema. The entrance and foyer of the cinema were rearranged in 1964, with the entry doors shifted west of the original entrance, and the original entrance area was converted into part of the confectionery counter. Air conditioning was installed in the cinema in October 1968 to combat the threat of television, but patronage continued to drop and the picture garden was demolished within a year. In 1981 alterations were made to the auditorium, with the seats in the front stalls removed and the other seating realigned. Architectural character The theatre reflects the architectural style popular in the inter-war period, using nautical motifs such as wavy lines, smooth flat curves and tubular handrails, with an architectural emphasis on both the horizontal and vertical aspects of the building. The Cygnet Cinema is an example of the Inter-War Functionalist style. Characteristics of this style are the asymmetrical massing of smooth geometric elements, and emphasis on exterior form reflecting internal function. The prominent central tower housed the 'bio box', which serviced both the indoor auditorium and the outdoor picture garden. Film canisters were hauled up to the 'bio box' balcony from the street. The tower extends out in a fashionable streamlined curve and features a cantilevered balcony with steel railings, resembling the form of a modern ocean liner. The 'liner' theme is reinforced by the three 'port hole' windows on the exterior of the building. The stylistic influence of Le Corbusier, a functional Modernist architect, is evident in these forms and detail. In the summer of 2013, American street artist Nils Westergard painted a portrait of Alfred Hitchcock on the western facing exterior wall of the building. Current uses In August 2004, the Heritage Council of Western Australia provided a $4,500 grant to prepare a conservation plan for the Cinema. The theatre is currently leased by independent operators from the owner, Colin Stiles, the son of the original owner, James Stiles. Heritage value The Cygnet Theatre was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 27 October 1998 and was classified by the National Trust (WA) on 2 May 1988. The building is also included on the City of South Perth's Municipal Inventory and was permanently listed on the State Register of Heritage Places on 30 June 1995.

Taking place during World War II, it formed part of the New Georgia campaign of the Pacific War. In the battle, two battalions of the U.S. Marine Raiders from the 1st Marine Raider Regiment, supported by two U.S. Army infantry battalions attacked a Japanese garrison guarding the port of Bairoko on the Dragons Peninsula, advancing from Enogai and Triri. After a day long engagement, the Japanese repulsed the American assault and forced the attacking troops to withdraw with their wounded to Enogai. US forces remained in the area carrying out patrolling and intelligence gathering operations until the end of the campaign. Bairoko was eventually captured at the end of August after the airfield at Munda had been captured, and further reinforcements sent from there towards Bairoko to clear the area from the south. Background=Strategic situation Allied landings in the New Georgias Following the completion of the Guadalcanal campaign in early 1943, the Allied high command began planning the next step in their effort to neutralize the main Japanese base at Rabaul as part of Operation Cartwheel. The advance north through the central Solomon Islands involved a series of operations to secure island bases for shipping and aircraft. Plans for 1943 conceived the capture of New Georgia and then later Bougainville by US troops. Elsewhere, in New Guinea, the Australians would capture Lae and Salamaua and secure Finschhafen.Keogh, pp. 287–290Rentz, p. 19 The campaign to secure New Georgia, designated Operation Toenails by US planners, was focused upon securing the airfield at Munda Point, on the western coast of New Georgia island. As part of this effort, several initial landings were undertaken to capture staging areas at Wickham Anchorage and Viru Harbor and an airfield at Segi Point in the southern part of New Georgia, to support the movement of troops and supplies from Guadalcanal. These supplies would be staged through to Rendova, which would be built up as base for further operations in New Georgia focused on securing the airfield at Munda. These preliminary operations began at the end of June 1943.Miller, pp. 70–84Rentz, p. 52 Opposing forces Approach to Bairoko, 5–20 July 1943 In the fighting around the port of Bairoko, a total of four American battalions were committed. The main attacking force consisted of two battalions of the U.S. Marine Raiders from the 1st Marine Raider Regiment (the 1st and 4th Battalions). Both battalions had been depleted by previous actions; the 1st around Enogai and the 4th in southern New Georgia. The Marines were supported by two U.S. Army infantry battalions (the 3rd Battalion, 145th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment).Miller pp. 99–103 Equipped for light maneuver, no artillery had been provided. The Marines lacked heavy weapons, although the two U.S. Army battalions possessed heavy mortars and machine guns. Air support was available, but was unreliable.Stille p. 55 The US troops were commanded by Colonel Harry B. Liversedge.Miller pp. 127–129 Japanese forces had arrived around Enogai and Bairoko, on the Dragons Peninsula, in March 1942, as part of an effort to secure airbases on New Georgia to support their operations on Guadalcanal.Rottman, p. 65 Prior to the attack, US intelligence had estimated that Japanese forces in the Bairoko area numbered only 500 troops; in reality at the time of the US attack on Bairoko there were about 300 Japanese soldiers and 800 naval personnel in the area, making a total of 1,100.Rentz p. 20 The main Japanese unit holding Bairoko was Colonel Saburo Okumura's Kure 6th Special Naval Landing Force; these were reinforced by elements of the 2nd Battalion, 13th Infantry Regiment.Rentz p. 110 (map) On 13 July, part of the 2nd Battalion, 45th Infantry Regiment, and a battery from the 6th Field Artillery Regiment arrived, after which the 13th Infantry Regiment began moving from Bairoko to join the fighting around Munda.Miller p. 105 Prelude After the initial American landings in New Georgia on 30 June, the Allies quickly secured Rendova as well as the other staging areas in southern New Georgia. On 2 July, elements from two US infantry regiments crossed the Blanche Channel to the western coast of New Georgia, landing around Zanana to begin the drive on Munda Point. To support this effort a separate landing group was detached to secure the area around Bairoko on the northern coast.Miller, p. 92 Allied planners believed that the area lay astride key Japanese lines of communication that were used to support the troops holding the Munda area. Consequently, the Northern Landing Group was tasked with blocking the Munda–Bairoko trail and securing Bairoko Harbor, which provided the sea link with the Japanese base at Vila on Kolombangara to the northwest.Shaw & Kane, pp. 119Miller, pp. 70 & 94–95. To achieve this, a force of U.S. Marine Raiders, supported by two US Army infantry battalions, landed at Rice Anchorage, on the northern coast of New Georgia island, on 5 July.Shaw & Kane, p. 121 After the landing at Rice Anchorage US troops advanced inland and following a short battle captured Enogai on 10–11 July. The Marine raiders consolidated their position around Enogai from 12 July and began patrolling the local area. Meanwhile, troops from the 3rd Battalion, 145th Infantry Regiment held a blocking position to the south along the Munda–Bairoko trail to prevent Japanese reinforcements being sent south to attack the US troops that had begun an advance on Munda airfield. The blocking position was initially successful when it was established on 8 July, but it came under increasing pressure due to its isolation. As Japanese attacks increased, the Americans were forced off the high ground. Casualties mounted and illness began to spread. A rifle company from the US 145th Infantry Regiment was dispatched to reinforce them on 13 July, but eventually Liversedge gave the order for the blocking position to be abandoned due to difficulties resupplying it, and the soldiers returned to Triri on 17 July.Shaw & Kane pp. 131–133 After the capture of Enogai, US patrols had been ordered to range south to establish contact with the troops from the 43rd Infantry Division around Munda, but this was not achieved.Miller p. 104 During the period the block was in place, US casualties amounted to 11 men killed and 29 wounded, while around 250 Japanese were killed. On 18 July, Liversedge's force was reinforced by 700 Marines from Lieutenant Colonel Michael S. Currin's 4th Raider Battalion, which had previously been involved in actions around Segi Point, Viru Harbor and Wickham Anchorage in the south. These troops arrived aboard four high-speed transports, Ward, Kilty, McKean and Waters.Rentz pp. 38 & 111 Due to their involvement in previous actions, Currin's force was significantly under strength. Nevertheless, their arrival at Rice Anchorage, which was being held by a detachment of the 3rd Battalion, 145th Infantry Regiment, brought Liversedge's men fresh supplies—up to 15 days' worth of rations, as well as ammunition and other stores—and allowed the US forces to begin planning the next stage of their advance in the area. Battle Liversedge subsequently made plans to capture Bairoko village, which lay on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July.Morison p. 202 The plan entailed a pincer movement: while the US Army detachment attacked the village from the southeast the Marines were to assault from the northeast.Shaw & Kane pp. 134–135 This would see two companies from the 1st Raider Battalion (Lieutenant Colonel Samuel B. Griffith) advance either side of the Leland Lagoon from Enogai, with Currin's 4th Raider Battalion following behind them to provide reinforcements if required. The 3rd Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment (Lieutenant Colonel Delbert E. Schultz) would push inland from Triri along the Triri–Bairoko Trail to attack Bairoko from the south, converging with the 1st. Meanwhile, two companies of Marines would hold Enogai and elements from the 3rd Battalion, 145th Infantry Regiment (Lieutenant Colonel George G. Freer) would defend Triri and the supply depot around Rice Anchorage, along with a number of medical, supply and anti-tank detachments.Rentz p. 111Shaw & Kane pp. 123 & 134 Attack on Bairoko, 20 July 1943 The Japanese defensive positions around Bairoko were formidable and the garrison had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage. Nevertheless, the attack began around 08:00 hours. The 3rd Battalion, 148th Infantry Regiment began the approach, stepping off from Triri along the Triri–Bairoko Trail at this time. They were followed half an hour later by the 1st Raider Battalion, which had been reorganized into two full strength companies and two under strength companies, who set off from Enogai, to the north. The two full strength companies, Companies B and D, were committed to the assault, while A and C remained around Enogai, adopting a defensive posture. The 4th Raider Battalion followed shortly after the 1st, advancing along the Enogai–Bairoko Trial parallel with the southern shore of Leland Lagoon. One platoon from the 1st Raider Battalion advanced along the sandspit to the north of the lagoon, on the extreme right of the advancing US forces.Rentz pp. 111–112 Throughout the morning, as the attack unfolded the 1st Raider Battalion advanced slowly over difficult terrain and skirmished with a series of Japanese outposts. By 10:45 hours, they came under heavy, sustained fire across their entire front, and the Marines deployed their reserve platoon to protect their left flank. Shaking out from their initial column-of-file formation, the Marines continued to advance their line, while Japanese snipers and light machine guns continued to harass the advance. By midday, the Japanese defenders withdrew to their main defensive line on several ridges around from Bairoko Harbor. Attempts to reduce this line were hampered by the lack of air support, which despite being requested, failed to arrive.Rentz, pp. 111–113 The heaviest weapon the Marines possessed were their 60 mm mortars, which proved ineffective against the Japanese positions. Schultz's battalion, operating to the south possessed heavier 81 mm mortars, but ultimately poor radio communications and damaged telephone wire prevented coordination between the two battalions. Company D, 1st Raider Battalion was able to gain some ground, but eventually the advance came to a halt, as they came under heavy machine gun fire across their entire front from Japanese defenders occupying several bunkers constructed out of logs and coral. In an effort to outflank these positions, Liversedge, who had positioned himself with the northernmost prong of the attack, ordered the 4th Raiders to attempt to turn the Japanese flank, advancing to the south of the 1st Raiders. With this assistance, two lines of the Japanese defensive position were captured, but eventually, under heavy fire from 90 mm mortars, the attack ground to a halt. A US Marine 60 mm mortar crew Meanwhile, the southern advance by the 148th Infantry Regiment was held up by thick jungle and swamps, and was eventually halted about from Bairoko by Japanese holding the high ground. In the ensuing fight, heavy casualties were inflicted on the attacking US troops, who were unable to maneuver due to the terrain. By early afternoon, the 4th Raider Battalion had sustained over 90 critically injured personnel and their commander resorted to calling down mortar fire to break the deadlock.Rentz pp. 112–115 The Marines to the north in the 1st Raider Battalion had suffered even more heavily, with around 200 casualties from the 1,000 men committed. Ultimately, the day-long assault by the Americans was unsuccessful.Miller pp. 129–131 Neither attacking force made any significant progress, and the air support that Liversedge had requested during the attack was not provided. Communications with Schultz's battalion were restored late in the day as the telephone wire was repaired by a party of the 145th Infantry Regiment, and as US casualties began to mount Liversedge considered his options. After discussing the situation with his battalion commanders, he decided to withdraw around 17:00 hours. Initially, Liversedge had considered bringing up reinforcements from the 145th to renew the attack, but these companies were too dispersed to concentrate quickly enough, and the Japanese were poised to bring in reinforcements during the night. After the order to withdraw was given, US medical personnel began collecting the wounded and moving them to an aid station to prepare them to be carried back to Enogai. The troops would withdraw in contact, covered by a firm base from two companies from the 4th Raiders, reinforced by a reserve company from the 145th Infantry Regiment.Rentz p. 116 Aftermath An American burial party in the aftermath of the fighting on the Dragons Peninsula After calling-off the assault, the Americans withdrew to nearby Enogai in stages, moving firstly to a defensive perimeter on the night of 20/21 July. Largely the Japanese did not pursue them, although they did launch a minor probing raid around 02:00 hours on 21 July, which resulted in five Japanese and one Marine being killed; another nine Marines were wounded. An hour later, a Japanese aircraft unsuccessfully attacked the American perimeter. Just before dawn on 21 July, air strikes were requested by US troops to cover their withdrawal, which began at 06:00 hours. Air support from land-based aircraft had been quite poor earlier in the campaign, but the support provided at this time amounted to the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign to that point.Horton pp. 105–108Rentz p. 117 The withdrawal lasted into the early afternoon. The final group of US troops reached Enogai just after 14:30 hours, withdrawing from the seaspit to the north of the Leland Lagoon. Casualties during the attack and the subsequent withdrawal amounted to 50 Americans killed while the Japanese lost at least 33 killed. The wounded were evacuated in litters, assisted by local laborers, and were evacuated back to Enogai through multiple staging areas, and then by boat from the Leland Lagoon. From Enogai, the US wounded were flown back to Guadalcanal by three seaplanes; one of which was attacked by a Japanese fighter after takeoff, and returned to Enogai to remain overnight.Rentz p. 118 As a result of their efforts to capture Bairoko, Liversedge's force was essentially spent. Nevertheless, the American forces remained in the Enogai area until the end of the New Georgia campaign to gather information and interdict Japanese supply lines. Initially, US intelligence had assessed that the Japanese were using Bairoko to resupply and reinforce their troops who were guarding an airfield at Munda Point, southwest of Bairoko on the western coast of New Georgia and that by blocking the trail they prevented this from occurring. Analysis after the war, though, has shown this was not correct as the Japanese did not use the Bairoko–Munda trail for resupply efforts.Shaw & Kane p. 133 In early August, Liversedge began another effort to capture Bairoko. At this time, reinforcements from the 25th Infantry Division arrived in New Georgia. These troops landed on the western coast, and began to advance on Bairoko from the south, after the U.S. and its allies successfully captured the airfield on 4/5 August. While troops from the 25th Division advanced north, carrying out mopping up operations, Liversedge's force advanced again across the Dragons Peninsula from Enogai towards Bairoko, commencing 23 August.Miller p. 166 (map) The Japanese subsequently evacuated New Georgia and abandoned Bairoko, which was captured by US forces on 24 August.Horton p. 109Miller pp. 167–171 NotesReferences   * * Further reading     - Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center also recognised it as the eighth tropical depression, the seventh tropical storm and the sixth typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season. Kalmaegi (Helen) formed as a tropical depression on 13 July when it was located to the east of the Philippines. It was named Kalmaegi by RSMC Tokyo on 15 July; the storm reached its peak winds of on 17 July. Shortly afterwards it made a direct landfall on Taiwan and then moved into China's Fujan province the next day it emerged into the Taiwan Strait and raced towards North Korea where it became fully extratropical and the last advisories were released. Meteorological history Early on July 13, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), began to issue full advisories on a tropical depression, which was located to the east of the Philippines. Later that day PAGASA allocated the name Helen to the depression, followed the next day by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designating the number 08W. Early on July 15, both the JTWC, and the JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, with RSMC Tokyo assigning the name \\"Kalmaegi\\" to the storm, which was submitted by North Korea and is Korean for seagull. Early on the 17th, Kalmaegi began rapidly intensifying; JMA was the first agency to upgrade it into a typhoon.https://www.webcitation.org/5ZMsTdFev JTWC followed a few hours later.ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2008071703-WTPN.PGTW Finally, PAGASA upgraded Kalmaegi (Helen) into a typhoon on later that day.https://www.webcitation.org/5ZNPprwWK Typhoon Kalmaegi, which was downgraded to tropical storm status by Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau while still east of the country, made landfall at Ilan County in northeast Taiwan in the evening of July 17 at 19:40 local time (13:40 UTC) and emerged into the Taiwan Strait at 7:20 in the morning local time (01:20 UTC) on July 18. From Taiwan, the typhoon, now downgraded to a tropical storm, turned toward southeast China. In Xiapu County of Fujian Province, the tropical storm made landfall at 17:50 local time (0950 UTC), with winds of about 90 miles per hour. Early on July 19, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Kalmaegi and downgraded it to a tropical depression. However, the JMA continued to issue advisories and maintained Kalmaegi as a tropical storm as it moved to the Yellow Sea. Late the next day, the JMA downgraded Kalmaegi to a low (extratropical cyclone) as it moved inland over North Korea. Preparations Taichung City from Typhoon Kalmaegi. Philippines PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signals for provinces across Northern Luzon from July 14 till the 17th. Initially, PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 1 over Cagayan, Isabela, Batanes Group of Islands and Calayan Group of Islands.https://www.webcitation.org/5ZJTvHEgU?url=http://www.geocities.com/dynasmon/PAGASA_Extra.html But as the storm tracked nearer to Northern Luzon, more and more are issued Signals 1, 2 and 3. By the afternoon of the 16th Philippine Time, only Batanes was left under Signal Number one. PAGASA issued their last advisory on Helen (Kalmaegi) on 2100 UTC 17 July (5 a.m. 18 July PST).https://www.webcitation.org/5ZOHzu3n1 Taiwan Several flights in and out of Taiwan were either delayed or cancelled due to the typhoon.

Impact=Philippines In the Philippines, it passed over Northern Luzon (mostly affecting Ilocos and Cagayan Valley), where it killed two people and injured another. The first fatality occurred after a man drove off the edge of a cliff due to poor visibility. The second was linked to a snake bite following the storm. In all, Kalmaegi (Helen) affected at least 31,129 people throughout 146 barangays in three provinces. Property damages amounted to ₱ 5.6 million. The storm also hit 82 villages (all in Northern Luzon) and caused around ₱1.3 million worth of damage to agriculture. Meanwhile, the storm intensified the southwest monsoon, thus causing torrential rains over the rest of Luzon. The resulting rains thus caused suspension of classes in parts of Metro Manila.http://www.gmanews.tv/story/107300/Manila-suspends-afternoon- college-classes Taiwan Repair crews fixing damage to Wuquan South Road in downtown Taichung the day after Typhoon Kalmaegi passed through.

Tainan County (now part of Tainan City) in southern Taiwan reported more than 1100 mm of rainfall in some mountain regions. An estimated 600 mm (23.6 in) of rain fell within seven hours, causing several drainage systems to overflow. Local media reported that an estimate 115,000 people in Taiwan, primarily in Tainan, Nantou County, and Taichung County (now part of Taichung City) lost power during the storm. The storm caused NT$ 300 million (US$15.1 million) worth of damage, and destroyed about 5,100 hectares of orchards and crops. Agricultural losses amounted to $300 million (USD). Mainland China In Xiapu County of Fujian Province and in neighboring Zhejiang Province, 360,000 residents left coastal and low-lying homes to escape the storm. Schools and many businesses remained closed, and the storm was expected to travel northwest. Republic of Korea The remnants of Kalmaegi produced heavy rains over the Korean Peninsula, peaking at 237.5 mm (9.3 in) in Seoul. Rainfall rates were recorded up to 52.5 mm (2 in) per hour at times, caused water to overflow at several of the major dams along the Han, Nakdong, and Geum Rivers. One dam, the Paldang- Dam had to discharge water at a rate of 4,817 m3 (170,110 ft3) per second. Eight levees were breached, with a total length of 105 m (344 ft), due to rising rivers, flooding 93 homes and 87.58 hectares (216.4 acres) of farmland. Rains also caused landslide which covered an area of 0.6 hectares (1.4 acres) and washed out a small bridge. Four people were killed, another was listed as missing, and a total of 271 were affected by the storm. Japan Yonaguni, lying at the end of the Ryukyu Islands near Taiwan, experienced strong winds gusting up to 98 km/h (60 mph). Russia After moving through the Sea of Japan, the remnants of Kalmaegi brought significant rainfall and strong winds to parts of eastern Russia. Winds were reported to be gusting up to 85 km/h (50 mph) in Primorsky Krai and southern Khabarovsk Krai. Several rivers in Primorsky were reportedly near flood stage as the storm passed through. Offshore, Several ships were stranded during the storm and sent out distress signals. Aftermath=Philippines Relief goods, worth ₱138,744 were sent to affected areas within region one. Taiwan Government officials in Taiwan enacted a large rescue operation involving over 60,000 civilian and government rescue workers. Following the severe flooding in Taiwan, officials in Mainland China were willing to send fresh vegetables whenever needed. Naming The name Kalmaegi was submitted to the World Meteorological Organisation's Typhoon Committee by North Korea and was one of the original names submitted for use from January 1, 2000.
