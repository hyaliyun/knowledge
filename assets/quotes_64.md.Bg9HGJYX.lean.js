One of the most popular fighters during the War Years, he headlined at Madison Square Garden on twenty one occasions, a record that still stands. He was considered \\"The greatest lightweight ever\\" by Cus D'Amato, famous boxing trainer and manager. Early years Sidney Walker was born in Waynesboro, Georgia on April 1, 1921. After the death of his mother he moved to Augusta, and stayed with his grandmother, Evie Mixom, who affectionately called him \\"Beau Jack\\". He grew up during the Depression on a ragged farm where he worked the fields, and in the evening would work as a shoe-shine boy. A few days a week he would arise early, walk three miles into town and shine shoes till dusk. To make extra money, he would engage in battle royales, which consisted of five to ten boys, usually Black, fighting each other, often blindfolded, until only one remained standing. The winner was given a purse by the white organizers. The practice, more common in the South, simultaneously exploited youth, Blacks, and the poor. Following his first battle royale at the Augusta National Golf Club, Jack accepted a position as a caddie there. He quickly befriended some of the club's members, including golfing legend Bobby Jones, who helped fund his boxing training. Boxing career Jack turned professional in 1940, and began his career fighting in Massachusetts where he established an impressive record of 27-4-2. During this period, he earned his reputation as a relentless and powerful fighter, essential traits that endeared him to his fans and won over admirers. First taking the NYSAC World Lightweight Championship, December 1942 He moved to New York City in August 1941, where he continued to impress under the management of Chick Wergeles. In November 1942, he found himself in a fight against Allie Stolz at Madison Square Garden to determine who would challenge for the New York version of the world lightweight title. Going into the fight, Stolz was the clear favorite, with 3-1 odds. Before an enthusiastic crowd, Jack staged an upset, winning the match with a technical knockout of Stolz in the seventh round. Stoltz had cuts on his left eyelid and eyebrow that led the referee to end the bout. In his first NYSAC Lightweight Title bout against Tippy Larkin on December 18, 1942, Jack surprised again by knocking out the champion in the third round with a right uppercut to the chin. He floored Larkin with a left hook for a count of one in the first minute of the first round. The bout was furious and both boxers landed constant blows, though Jack seemed to withstand the onslaught of Larkin and deliver an equal or greater number of counterpunches. Larkin was carried to his corner from a blow by Jack, 1:19 into the third, that rendered him unconscious for the ten count. It was only the third KO of Larkin's career. Both boxers were within a pound of 133.Cuddy, Jack, \\"Beau Jack's Win Impressive\\", The Berkshire Evening Eagle, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, pg. 7, December 19, 1942. Victories over Fritzie Zivic, February ‚Äì March 1943 Jack twice defeated Fritzie Zivic at Madison Square Garden on February 5, and March 5, 1943, in ten and twelve round unanimous decisions, though their second meeting was rather close. One source wrote Zivic was known for \\"dirty tactics\\", and that he fought like \\"a back ally brawler.\\"Zivic was a dirty fighter in Sterrit, Mike, (2011) The Great Underrated Boxers, iUniverse Books, Bloomington, Indiana, pg. 17 The crowd of more than 20,000 in the Garden on February 5, were displeased when Jack was called for a low blow in the eighth round, and the point's scoring became closer when Jack lost the round as a result of the foul. Nonetheless, the referee and judges gave the bout to Jack by at least a two-round margin.\\"Zivic Loses to Beau Jack on Low Blow\\", The Daily Tribune, Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, pp. 5, February 6, 1943. On April 2, 1943, Beau Jack defeated the great Henry Armstrong in a ten-round unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden. Armstrong had previously held the Featherweight, Lightweight and Welterweight World Championships. Losing the NYSAC World Lightweight Championship to Bob Montgomery, May 1943 Jack held the World Lightweight Title for only six months before dropping it to fellow hall-of-famer Bob Montgomery on May 21, 1943, before 18,343 in a fifteen-round unanimous points decision at the Garden. Jack won the first round by a wide margin with a flurry of uppercuts and his signature free-wheeling, constant punching from many angles. But Montgomery quickly settled down and scored frequently with a strong straight right that at times had Jack close to a knockout and against which he could find no adequate defense. Jack's eyes were virtually closed during much of the bout, but Montgomery's injuries were restricted to a cut above one eye. A right to the chin briefly knocked Jack to his knees in the eleventh round and he struggled in the remaining rounds. One ringside reporter gave Montgomery eleven rounds to only four for Jack.Carver, Lawton, \\"Jack Drubbed As Philly Negro Pulls Big Upset\\", The News Journal, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 15, May 22, 1943. Regaining the World Lightweight Championship from Montgomery, November 1943 Jack would go on to regain the title from Montgomery on November 19, 1943 in a fifteen-round unanimous decision at New York's Madison Square Garden before a crowd of 17,866. Beau carefully followed the advice of his trainer Larry Amadee, who told him to stay close to Montgomery, fight fiercely when separated from clinches, and generally use his strength in infighting. He coasted on the advice of Amadee in several rounds. He stayed with Amadee's advice when Montgomery finished strong in the last five rounds. The Associated Press gave Jack seven rounds, six to Montgomery, and two even, though both judges gave Jack an impressive ten rounds. In the ninth round, Jack scored one of his strongest blows after coming out of a clinch, and it helped him to take the offensive and win the ninth and tenth rounds. In the final five and particularly the last two rounds, Montgomery seemed strongest, nearly taking the bout in the opinion of some ringside.Meier, Ted, \\"Bobcat Bob to Receive Another Go At Crown\\", The Mason-City Glove Gazette, Mason City, Iowa, pg. 4, November 20, 1943. Jack was battered and required great conditioning and willpower to hold on through the final rounds.Feder, Sid, \\"New Titleholder Weathers Strong Finish to Win Decision\\", The Ottawa Journal, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, pg. 18, November 20, 1943. Jack met Sammy Angott in a non-title match on January 28, 1944, drawing in ten rounds at Madison Square Garden before an impressive crowd of 19,113, the largest of the year. The match was an important contest between Jack, the New York State World Lightweight Champion, and Angott, the National Boxing Association World Lightweight Champion. Who led the battle see-sawed from boxer to boxer so frequently, it was a difficult contest to score. There were no knockdowns in the bout. The United Press gave each boxer four rounds with two even. Angott had a problem from a thigh injury he had received in training and was limping as he was led from the ring at the end of the bout.Cuddy, Jack, \\"Sammy Angott Battles Beau Jack to Draw\\", The St. Louis Star and Times, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 5, January 29, 1944.Cuddy, Jack, \\"Turn Away Crowd Sees Lightweights\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 9, January 29, 1944 Jack finally lost the Lightweight Championship for the second time to Montgomery on March 3, 1944 in a fifteen-round split decision before 19,066 fans in Madison Square Garden. Jack had led in the early betting. The fighting was fierce and close throughout and Montgomery was given no more than a two- round advantage by the judges or referee, though the Associated Press scored the bout 8 for Montgomery, 4 for Jack, and three even. It would be Jack's last lightweight title match until meeting Ike Williams in July 1948.\\"19,066 Fans See Bob Montgomery Defeat Beau Jack\\", The Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, pg. 2, March 4, 1944. On March 17, 1944, he defeated Al \\"Bummy\\" Davis, the \\"Brooklyn Bomber\\", at Madison Square Garden before a crowd of nearly 20,000, in a ten- round unanimous decision. The referees and judges gave him no less than nine of the rounds, with two scoring all ten rounds for Jack. Jack, who was a slight favorite in the betting, brought crowds to the Garden in 1943‚Äì44. The Georgia boot-black got out of his crouching style and slugged it out in close quarters with Davis in several rounds.Howell, Fritz, \\"Ex-Georgia Bootblack Beats Brooklyn Bomber\\", Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 11, March 18, 1944. Win over NBA Lightweight Champion Juan Zurita, March 31, 1944 On March 31, 1944, Jack defeated Mexican-born boxer Juan Zurita in a ten-round points decision at New York's Madison Square Garden. Zurita had taken the NBA Lightweight Title only three weeks earlier from Sammy Angott in Los Angeles. Zurita faded after the fifth round, and was given only three rounds to seven for Jack by the United Press. The Mexican champion looked strong in the tenth, and took the round. The capacity crowd of 17,593 were hoping for more action in the early rounds, but both boxers, knowing the skills of their opponent fought cautiously.\\"Beau Jack Wins Over Zurita in Garden\\", The Ogden Standard-Examiner, Ogden, Utah, pg. 3, 1 April 1944Crowd of 17,593, in \\"Beau Jack Decisions Juan Zurita\\", The Bakersfield Californian, Bakersfield, California, pg. 9, 1 April 1944 War bonds fight with Bob Montgomery, August 1944 Some consider the most famous fight of Jack's career, a bout with Montgomery on August 4, 1944. Staged at a critical time in the second World War, it became known as the \\"War Bonds Fight\\", and tickets were only made available to purchasers of war bonds. A ringside seat required purchase of a $100,000 war bond.$100,000 for a ringside seat in Williams, Bernard, \\"I Bet You Didn't Know\\", Clarion Ledger, Jackson, Mississippi, pg. 23, 1 April 2000 Although Montgomery's title was not on the line, the gate was a record $36 million with 15,822 war bonds being sold. Many people who purchased bonds charitably left their tickets at the box office to be used by American servicemen. Montgomery and Jack, who were both serving as privates in the US Army, refused to take purses for the fight. Jack took the fight on points after 10 rounds, however the highlight of the evening was when the lights dimmed and a spotlight shone on Joe Louis was standing in the front row. Louis was received with a standing ovation. Jack met Sammy Angott for the second time on July 8, 1946 at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., where a crowd of 10,353 saw Jack win in a seventh-round technical knockout. Angott was very briefly down in round two, and Jack was down twice briefly in round four. The fighting was close but Jack rallied strongly in rounds five and six, and Angott did not answer the opening bell in round seven. The fighters boxed \\"as if the world championship was at stake\\". It was a \\"wild\\" and \\"reckless\\" fight and injuries suffered by Angott to his hip and back were briefly investigated at the request of the D.C. Boxing Commission after the fight. X-rays determined the aging thirty-one year old Angott had chipped a rib and suffered a torn ligament in his foot.\\"Two Monday Night Fights Being Probed Today\\", The Reno Gazette Journal, Reno, Nevada, pg. 14, 9 July 1946\\"Angott Cleared Gets Purse\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 22, 10 July 1946Crowd of 10,353 in \\"Beau Jack Stops Sammy Angott in Wild Fight\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 10, 9 July 1946 Last shot at the World Lightweight Title, Ike Williams, July 1948 Jack would not challenge for the title again until July 12, 1948 when he fought hall-of-famer and reigning champion Ike Williams in a sixth-round TKO at Shibe Park in Philadelphia. The fighting was fairly close in the first three rounds, as the referee gave one round to each fighter, and declared one even. The fourth was fought cautiously but by the fifth, Williams penetrated Beau's defenses and connected repeatedly. Williams brutally ended the bout with a left hook and flurry of subsequent blows in the sixth which led the referee to end the bout.\\"Champ Keeps Crown as Ref Halts Battle\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 33, 13 July 1948 Williams was managed and on occasion financially exploited by boxing promoter Frank \\"Blinky\\" Palermo, who was Mafia-connected and a partner of Murder Inc. button-man Frankie Carbo. Carbo operated a stable of fighters which would later include heavyweight champion Sonny Liston. The first bout marked the start of a rivalry between Williams and Jack who would go on to fight on three more occasions. With Jack's skills clearly waning, Williams took the first match by a split decision, tied in the second match with a draw, and won the third when his opponent Jack was unable to answer the ninth round bell. Their third fight, on August 12, 1958 in Augusta, Georgia, though memorable, marked the end of Jack's career. Life after boxing He retired with a record of 83 wins, with 40 knockouts, 24 losses and five draws. After retirement, he ran a drive-in barbecue stand and operated a small farm in Augusta, Georgia. He refereed wrestling matches in South Carolina during the period. With his boxing earnings, he moved to Miami and returned to shoe shining, working at Miami Beach's Fontainebleau Hotel. He trained fighters in Miami's Fifth Street Gym. Family Beau Jack had seven children, Ronald, Donald, George, Barbara Ann, Yvonne, Georgiana and Timothy. His wife was named Josephine. None of the sons became boxers. Last years and death In his later years he suffered from poverty and Parkinson's disease. He died at 78, in a Miami nursing home, on February 9, 2000, of complications from Parkinson's disease.

The toponym also refers to a Jewish community of religious Zionists who settled on land a mile from the archaeological ruins in 1986. In 1986, the site of Palestinian Susya was declared an archaeological site by Israeli Defense Ministry's Civil Administration, and the IDF subsequently expelled the Palestinian inhabitants from their dwellings. The Palestinians then moved a few hundred meters southeast of their original village.Stefano Pasta, \\"Cisgiordania, Susiya: i pastori palestinesi che tutte le mattine temono l'arrivo dei bulldozer\\", La Repubblica 10 June 2015: \\"Espropriati nel 1986, sotto sgombero dal 5 maggio. Fino a quell'anno i palestinesi abitavano nelle grotte a mezzo chilometro di distanza. Ne furono espropriati quando l'area fu riconosciuta sito archeologico. Andarono quindi a vivere nei terreni agricoli limitrofi di Susiya, di loro propriet√† ma senza il permesso per costruire.\\" The population of the Palestinian community reportedly numbered 350 in 2012 and 250 residents the following year,\\"Khirbet Susiya\\", B'tselem 1 Jan 2013. constituted by 50 nuclear families (2015), up from 25 in 1986 and 13 in 2008. The Israeli government, which has issued temporary injunctions against High Court decisions to demolish illegal Israeli outposts, made a petition to the High Court to permit the demolition of Palestinian Susya. The state expressed a willingness to allocate what it called Israeli government-owned lands near Yatta for an alternative residence, and to assist rebuilding, considering it ideal for the displaced villagers grazing. The official view of Israel is that no historic Palestinian village ever existed there, just a few families resided seasonally there, and this area was required for archaeological work. It is notable that Jews also reside in illegal structures on the same archaeological site. The attorney for the Palestinians replied that the army was stopping Palestinians building on their own privately owned land, while permitting settlers to seize their agricultural fields.Chaim Levinson, \\"Israel seeks to demolish Palestinian village on 'archaeological' grounds\\", Haaretz 28 March 2015. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law; the Israeli government disputes this. Name The site is called in Arabic Khirbet Susiya, also spelled Susiyeh, which means \\"Ruin of the Liquorice Plant\\" after a wild plant species widely growing there. The spelling Susya represents the Hebrew name, as decided by the Israeli Naming committee, in consultation with the settlers.\\"A unique case is Susya. The existence of the ancient Jewish town was unknown in Jewish sources, but was discovered in archaeological excavations ... the settlers are not free to decide on the names chosen: the National Naming Committee at the Prime Minister's Office has that responsibility and considers various factors. The settlers, however, being well acquainted with the territory and its history, play a significant role in the decision.\\" Michael Feige, Settling in the Hearts: Fundamentalism, Time, and Space in Judea and Samaria, Wayne State University Press, 2009isbn978-0-814-33750-0 pp.75‚Äì76 History=Late Roman and Byzantine periods According to Israel archaeologist Yonathan Mizrachi, the Jewish population is attested from the 4th to 6th century, after which a population change took place. The settlement on the hill contiguous to the synagogue seems to have once had a thriving economy. A fine store has been excavated from its ruins.See the drawing of the reconstruction and groundplan in Zeev Safrai, The economy of Roman Palestine, Routledge, 1994 p. 127 It may have undergone a decline in the second half of the 4th century, and again in the 6th century.

Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005 p. 484 Part of Negev's theory is that, in the wake of the Second Revolt (132‚Äì135), when the Romans garrisoned Khirbet el-Karmil, identified as the biblical Carmel, religious Jews uncomfortable with pagan symbols moved 2 km south-west to the present Susya (which they perhaps already farmed) and that, while they still regarded their new community as Carmel, the name was lost when the village's fortunes declined in the early Arab period, in part, it has been suggested, because the new Muslim overlords might not have tolerated its wine-based economy.1 Samuel:25 View of Susya Ancient synagogue Susya synagogue mosaic with Hebrew inscription Susiya is the site of an archaeologically notable ancient synagogue. The site was examined by Shmarya Guttman in 1969, who uncovered the narthex of a synagogue during a trial dig.

It is one of four of an architecturally unique group in the Southern Judean Hills.David Amit, \\"Architectural plans of Synagogues in the Southern Judean Hills and the 'Halakah. p. 129.Lee I.

Katz (ed.), The Cambridge History of Judaism: Vol. 4, The Late Roman- Rabbinic Period, Cambridge University Press, 1984 p. 540. Only six synagogues have been identified in Judea as a whole; the lower number may be accounted for by a shift in the Jewish population from Judah to Galilee in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The other three of this distinctive group are those of Eshtemoa, Horvat Maon, and 'Anim. Three outstanding characteristics of the Susya-Eshtemoa group, are their width, entrances at the short eastern wall, and the absence of columns to support the roof.David Amit, \\"Architectural plans of Synagogues in the Southern Judean Hills and the 'Halakah. p. 138 According to David Amit, the architectural design, particularly the eastern entrance and axis of prayer, which differ from the majority of Galilean synagogues, exhibits the ramifications of the earliest halakhic law conserved in southern Judea for generations after the destruction of the Temple. This was forgotten in Galilee, but in Judea there was a closer adherence to older traditions reflecting closer proximity to Jerusalem.David Amit, pp. 148‚Äì155, pp. 148, 152 The eastern orientation may be also related to the idea of dissuading heretics and Christians in the same area, who bowed to the east, in the belief that the Shekinah lay in that direction.p. 146 Interior of the synagogue The synagogue was built as a broadhouse, rather than along basilica lines,\\"Uniquely Jewish adaptations of Christian architecture did occur. The synagogues at Khirbet Shema, in the Upper Galilee, Horvat Rimmon 1 in the southern Shephelah, at Eshtemoa, and Khirbet Susiya were built as broadhouses and not as longhouse basilicas. In these buildings, the basilica form is turned on its side, and the focal point of the synagogue is the wide wall of the hall. Benches were built round the interior walls of these synagogues, focusing attention on the centre of the room. This architecture is a continuation of the house-synagogues that literary sources suggests existed from the second and third centuries.\\" Steven Fine, Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Cambridge University Press, 2005 p. 88Eric M.

There was a secondary bimah in the eastern section. Unlike other synagogues in Judea it had a gallery, made while reinforcing the western wall. East of the synagogue was an open courtyard surrounded on three sides by a roofed portico. The western side opened to the synagogue's narthex, and the floor of the narthex composed of coloured mosaics set in an interlaced pattern. This model was of short duration, yielding in the late Byzantine phase (6th/7th) to the basilica form, already elsewhere dominant in synagogue architecture.David Amit, \\"Architectural plans of Synagogues in the Southern Judean Hills and the 'Halakaha. p. 156 In contrast to most Galilean synagogues with their fa√ßade and Torah shrine on the same Jerusalem-oriented wall, the Judean synagogue at Susya, (as well as Esthtemoa and Maon) has the niche on the northern Jerusalem-oriented wall and entrances on the east side wall.Rachel Hachlili, \\"Jewish Art and Iconography in the Land of Israel\\", in Suzanne Richard (ed.), Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader, Eisenbrauns, 2003 p. 449 The synagogue floor of white tesserae has three mosaic panels, the eastern one a Torah Shrine, two menorahs, one on a screen relief showing two lampsor incense censers. See Steven Fine, p. 195 suspended from a bar between the menorah's upper branches,Rachel Hachlili, The menorah, the ancient seven- armed candelabrum: origin, form, and significance, Brill 2001, pp. 67, 228. For its reconstruction see p. 53. (possibly because the Torah shrine was flanked by lampstands, serving the dual purpose of symbolizing a connection between the synagogue and the TempleSteven Fine, p. 195 while functioning as a spotlight for the bimah and giving light for scriptural readings). This was near the reverse mirroring of the menorah pattern in the mosaics, heightened the central significance of the Torah shrine in the hallEric M.

The central panel composed of geometric and floral patterns. A spoke-wheel design before the central bimah, has led Gutman to believe it is the remnant of a zodiac wheel. Zodiac mosaics are important witness to the time, since they were systematically suppressed by the Church, and, their frequent construction in Palestinian synagogue floors may be an index of 'the \\"inculturation\\" of non-Jewish imagery and its resulting Judaization'.Steven Fine, Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world, pp. 196‚Äì197 The fragmentary state of the wheel mosaic is due to its replacement by a much cruder geometric pavement pattern, indicative of a desire to erase what later came to be thought of as objectionable imagery.Steven Fine, p. 95John Brian Harley, David Woodward, The History of Cartography: Cartography in prehistoric, ancient, and medieval Europe and the Mediterranean, Humana Press, 1987 p. 266. \\"Since mosaics were disapproved of by the Jews as graven images, they were both removed. In other mosaics of the Byzantine period from the Holy Land, the zodiac is represented only by the names of its signs rather than by their graphic representations.\\" The defacing of images may indicate changing Jewish attitudes to visual representations and graven images, perhaps influence by both Christian iconoclasm and Muslim aniconism.Steven Fine, \\"Synagogues in the Land of Israel\\", in Suzanne Richard (ed.) Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader, Eisenbrauns, 2003 p. 459. A motif that probably represented Daniel in the lion's den, as in the mosaics discovered at Naaran near Jericho and Ein Samsam in the GolanSteven Fine, \\"Archaeology and the Interpretation of Rabbinic Literature: Some Thoughts\\" in Matthew Kraus (ed.) How should rabbinic literature be read in the modern world?, Gorgias Press LLC, 2006 p. 214Eric Meyers, Galilee through the centuries, p. 232 was also tesselated, surviving only most fragmentarily. The figure, in an orans stance, flanked by lions, was scrubbed from the mosaics in line with later trends, in what Fine calls a \\"new aesthetic\\" at Khirbet Susiya, one that refurbished the designs to suppress iconographic forms thought by later generations to be objectionable. We can only reconstruct the allusion to Daniel from the remaining final Hebrew letters remaining, namely -el, .Steven Fine,. p. 96. Fine speculates whether reluctance to erase these letters reflects a religious reluctance among iconoclasts to delete letters that spell out the Divine name El, for, again highlighting the distinctiveness of the synagogue, \\"in no instance does an explicit Divine name appear in any Jewish synagogue inscription.\\" Another unique feature is number of inscriptions. Four were laid in mosaics: two in Hebrew, attesting perhaps to its conservation as a spoken language in this regionDavid Amit, pp.152‚Äì3 and two in Aramaic. Nineteen fragmentary inscriptions, some of which were in Greek,The Israel yearbook, Zionist Organization of America, Jewish Agency for Israel. Economic Dept. Israel Yearbook Publications, 1981 p. 120 were etched into the marble of the building. From these dedicatory inscriptions the impression is given that the synagogue was run by donorsin Aramaicbenei qartah, in Hebrew benei ha'ir (sons of the town), especially of residents of a small agrarian village. See Stuart S. Miller, \\"Sages and commoners in late antique  ºEre·∫ì Israel: a philological inquiry into local traditions\\" in Peter Sch√§fer, Catherine Hezser (eds.), The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture, Mohr Siebeck, 1998 p. 65 rather than by priests (k≈çhen).Meyers, Galilee throughout the centuries, p.265 The \\"rabbi\\" in these epigraphs appears to be an honorific for \\"master\\", and the role of such rabbis in the synagogue seems to have been that of being donors. For an early dating based on the rare \\"qedushat\\" (to his holiness') address used in amoraim correspondence (qedushat mari rabbi Issi ha-cohen ha-mehubad berabi) see Aharon Oppenheimer, \\"The Attempt of Hananiah, Son of Rabbi Joshua's Brother, to Intercalate the Year in Babylonia\\" in Peter Sch√§fer, Catherine Hezser (eds.), The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture, p. 260; Aharon Oppenheimer, Nili Oppenheimer, Between Rome and Babylon: studies in Jewish leadership and society, Mohr Siebeck, 2005 p. 389, sets it in the amoraic period. Early Islamic period After the Islamic conquest, the archaeological evidence appears to suggest that a new Muslim population immigrated to the South Hebron hills and settled next to the Jewish population.Gideon Avni (2014) The Byzantine-Islamic Transition in Palestine: An Archaeological Approach, OUP, p225 According Y. Mizrachi, a population change took place in the 7th century. Arabic inscriptions have been discovered belonging to the mosque, he adds, but have never been published, and the village thrived until the 12 century. The abandoned synagogue, or its atrium or courtyard, was converted into a mosque around the 10th century. A mosque was built atop the courtyard of the former synagogue. It featured a mihrab in the southern wall, a second mihrab between two columns in the southern portico, and \\"crude\\" stone benches along the walls. Magness, assessing the evidence uncovered by the several archaeologists who dug at the site, which includes an inscription, dates the mosque to the reign of Caliph Al-Walid I, in the early eighth century. Crusader/Ayyubid period By 1107, a Crusader named Gauterius Baffumeth was Lord of Hebron, and he donated the land of Sussia to the Hospitalers. In a document dated September28, 1110, Baldwin I approved and confirmed this donation.J. Delaville Le Roulx, Cartulaire g√©n√©ral de l'orde de St-Jean de J√©rusalem, 1, Paris 1896, no. 20, pp. 21‚Äì22, \\"... Preterea laudo et confirmo supradicto Hospitali quoddam casale, quod dedit ei Gauterius Baffumeth, et vocatur Sussia...\\"R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, pp. 12‚Äì13, No 57 As Baffumeth was Lord of nearby Hebron, Sussia is identified with Khirbet Susya. The dates suggest that the village was inhabited since the Arab period and has carried its name since then. The document calls Susya casale (village), a testimony to its agriculture nature.Note that in the late 19th century, it had been suggested that Sussia was a Khirbet close to Majdal Yaba; see: R√∂hricht, 1887, vol 10, p. 243 By 1154, Susya was presumably still in the hands of the Hospitalers, as that year Baldwin III, with the consent of his mother, Melisende, confirmed the gift from Baffumeth.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 74‚Äì75, No 293 In the 12th‚Äì13th centuries Crusader troops were garrisoned at nearby Chermala (Khirbet al-Karmil) and, in their wake, a few families moved into the ruins to exploit the rich agricultural land. According to local tradition,David Amit, \\"Architectural plans of Synagogues in the Southern Judean Hills and the 'Halakah. p. 132 the niche on the northern wall of the synagogue-turned-mosque that was used as a mihrab, dates to Saladin's time,Daniel Jacobs, Shirley Eber, Francesca Silvani, Israel and the Palestinian Territories. 2nd ed. Rough Guides, 1998 p. 414 Mamluk period Some researchers believe continuity of inhabitation lasted until the 13th century while others date it to the 15th century. 19th century explorers In his book The Land of Israel: A Journal of travel in Palestine, Henry Baker Tristram wrote \\"We rode rapidly on through Susieh, a town of ruins, on a grassy slope, quite as large as the others, and with an old basilica, but less troglodyte than Attir. Many fragments of columns strewed the ground, and in most respects it was a repetition of Rafat.\\"Tristram, 1865, p.387 The site of Khirbet Susiyeh was first described by V. Gu√©rin in 1869, who first recognized its importance.Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, The Holy Land: an Oxford archaeological guide from earliest times to 1700, 5th ed. Oxford University Press US, 2008 p. 351Avraham Negev, Shimon Gibson Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land, p.482. Victor Gu√©rin noted in 1863: \\"I see before me extend considerable ruins called Khirbet Sousieh. They are those of a city important bearing whose homes were generally well built, like attested by the vestiges that still remain, and possessed several buildings built in stone.\\"Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 172‚Äì173 In 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine says \\"This ruin has also been at one time a place of importance....\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, pp. 414‚Äì415 In the Survey of Western Palestine, based on an observation in 1874 on the area of the southeastern slope of a hill west of Susya, H.H. Kitchener and Claude Conder noted that \\"This ruin has also been at one time a place of importance....\\" They thought the ruins were that of a Byzantine monastery. German accounts later stated that it was a remnant of an ancient church. In 1937, the building to the north was identified by L. A. Meyer and A. Reifenberg as the site of a synagogue. Maps of the 19th century that made the distinction sometimes depicted Susieh as a ruin and sometimes as a village. For example, the Palestine Exploration Fund map of 1878 and the Gu√©rin map of 1881 showed it as a ruin, while the earlier Zimmermann map of 1850, the van de VeldeC.W.M. van de Velde, Narrative of a journey through Syria and Palestine in 1851 and 1852, published 1854, pp. 77‚Äì80 maps of 1858 and 1865, and the Osborn map of 1859 showed it as a village.PEF map sheet 25.

Reasons for the expansion were lack of land for agriculture and construction in the mother towns, which resulted in high prices of land, rivalry between the mother-towns chamulas wishing to control more land and resources and being a security buffer which made it more difficult for robber gangs raid the mother villages. Caves are used by local as residences, storage space and sheepfold. The affiliation between the satellite villages and mother town remained. While some of the satellites became permanent villages with communities of hundreds, others remained temporary settlements which served the shepherds and fallƒÅ·∏•ƒ´n for several months every year.Havakook pp. 25‚Äì31 In 1981‚Äì82 it was estimated 100‚Äì120 families dwelt in caves permanently in the Southern Mount Hebron region while 750‚Äì850 families lived there temporarily.Havakook p. 65 Yaakov Havakook, who lived with the locals in the region for several years, writes that the community at Khirbet Susya was seasonal and didn't live in there year-round. Families of shepherds arrived after the first rain (October‚ÄìNovember), stayed during the grazing season and left in April end or beginning of May. and the alike will discover, that every year, during grazing time, families of shepherds visit the caves in these ruins, with every shepherd family returning to and living in the same cave in which that family lived in the prior season. At the end of the rainy season, the shepherds abandon the caves which they used during the grazing months, and return to their village, or may visit other grazing areas. They were known for a special kind of cheese produced in their caves,Ephraim Stern, Ayelet Le·πøinzon-Gilbo ªa, Joseph Aviram, [The New encyclopedia of archaeological excavations in the Holy Land], Vol. 4, Israel Exploration Society & Carta, 1993 p. 1415: \\"a special kind of cheese that, until recently, was processed in the caves of Khirbet Susiya.\\" According to Rabbis for Human Rights, in 1948, the preexisting population was augmented by an influx of Palestinian refugees expelled during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War from the area of Ramat Arad, who purchased land in the area.\\"The origin of the expulsion ‚Äì A Brief history of Palestinian Susya\\", Rabbis for Human Rights 25 June 2012 In 1982 an Israel settlement planner, Plia Albeck, examined the area of Susiya, the synagogue and the Palestinian village built on and around it, and finding it legally difficult to advance Jewish settlement, wrote: > \\"The [ancient] synagogue is located in an area that is known as the lands of > Khirbet Susya, and around an Arab village between the ancient ruins.

The Israeli government official stance on the matter says \\"There was no historic Palestinian village at the archaeological site there; that the village consists of only a few seasonal residences for a few families; and the land is necessary for the continuation of archaeological work.\\" According to Regavim, an NGO which petitioned the Supreme Court to execute the demolition orders at Khirbet susya, the place was used as grazing area and olive agricalture seasonally before 1986. In a report, Regavim writes that travelers from the late 19th century report finding ruins (while nearby Semua was reported as inhabited), the British census from 19451945 census does not mention Susya and a survey from 1967, done after Six-Day War, refers to Khirbat Susya as ruins in contrast to nearby villages such as At-Tuwani, Yatta and more. =2010s Bedouin settlement= According to The Washington Post, the modern Bedouin residential settlement that exists as of 2016 is the result of European aid; Spain donated the school, Germany provided solar panels, the water pumps were funded by Ireland, while Norway, Italy, Belgium, and other countries funded the children's playground. However, it was noted that the makeshift shelters have \\"more the feeling of a protest camp than a functioning Palestinian village. There are no streets, shops or mosques, and no permanent homes.

The Jabor family supports a claim to land near Susya with Ottoman documents dated back to 1881 and the Nawaja family, who is originally from the Tel Arad area and moved to Susya in 1952, has documents as well. Their documents are problematic since the boundaries mentioned were described in terms of geography features which are hard to identify in the field. In July 2015 it was published that, according to an internal document of findings by the Israeli Civil Administration officer Moshe Meiri, the claim to ownership of the land appears to be grounded on a valid Ottoman period title, dating back to 1881, in the possession of the Jabor family, This document has been known to Israeli officials since 1982. Though the precise extent of their land was not specified in the document, in an internal review of the case in 2015, Meiri established from the geographical features mentioned that the land covered territory now belonging to the Jabor and Nawaja families, and the villages on the basis of their Ottoman period documents claim an area that covers some 3,000 dunams (741 acres).Barak Ravid, Chaim Levinson, \\"Defense Ministry internal report: Land at village slated for demolition privately owned by Palestinians\\", Haaretz 26 July 2015.\\"In light of new internal review, Israeli military administration to reevaluate demolishing West Bank village, report says\\", The Times of Israel 26 July 2015.

Most returned and rebuilt on a rocky escarpment within their traditional agricultural and grazing territory. Their wells taken, they were forced to buy water from nearby Yatta. Palestinian residents (2012) pay 25 NIS per cubic meter water brought in by tanks, which is 5 times the cost to the nearby Israeli settlement. Net consumption, at 28 litres per diem, is less than half what Palestinians consume (70 lpd) and less than the recommended WHO level. Israel sheep-herding settlers expanded their unfenced land use at Mitzpe Yair, the \\"Dahlia Farm\\" a term used by Susiya Palestinians to refer to the farm run by the widow of Yair Har-Sinai.\\"Testimony: Four settlers attack the Nawaj'ah family near the Susiya settlement, 8 June 2008\\", B'tselem 8 June 2008 According to B'tselem, by 2010 settlers were cultivating roughly 40 hectares, about 15% of the land area to which they deny access to the traditional Palestinian users of that area. Since 2000 Jewish settlers in Susya have denied Palestinians access to 10 cisterns in the area, or according to more recent accounts, 23, and try to block their access to others.Amanda Cahill Ripley, The Human Right to Water and Its Application in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Taylor & Francis, 2011 p. 155. Soil at Susya, with a market value of NIS 2,000 per truckload, is also taken from lands belonging to the village of Yatta.Chaim Levinson, \\"West Bank settlers stealing tons of soil from Palestinian land\\", Haaretz, 10 October 2012 The third expulsion occurred in June 2001, when settler civilians and soldiers drove the Palestinians of Susya out, without warning, with, reportedly violent arrests and beatings. On 3 July 2001, the Israeli army demolished dozens of homes in Susya and contiguous Palestinian villages, and bulldozed their cisterns, many ancient, built for gathering rainwater, and then filling them with gravel and cement to hinder their reuse. Donated solar panels were also destroyed, livestock killed, and agricultural land razed.. On Sept 26 of the same year, by an order of the Israeli Supreme Court, these structures were ordered to be destroyed and the land returned to the Palestinians. Settlers and the IDF prevented the villagers from reclaiming their land, some 750 acres. The villagers made an appeal to the same court to be allowed to reclaim their lands and live without harassment. Some 93 events of settler violence were listed. The settlers made a counter-appeal, and one family that had managed to return to its land suffered a third eviction. In 2002 an Israeli outpost was established without the necessary building permit. OCHA reports that as of 2012 the Israeli Civil Administration has imposed no demolitions on this outpost, which is connected to Israel's water and electricity networks, and cites the example as putative evidence that Israeli policy is discriminating between the two communities. In 2006, structures without a permit were demolished illegally on the orders of a low-ranking officer, and the demolition was strongly criticized 3 years later by the High Court of Israel. In September 2008 the Israeli army informed the Palestinians at Susya that a further 150 dunums (15 hectares), where 13 remaining rainwater cisterns are located, would be a \\"closed military area\\" to which they were denied access. Amnesty International described the resultant contrast between the Palestinian and Jewish Susyas as follows: > \\"in the nearby Israeli settlement of Sussia, whose very existence is > unlawful under international law, the Israeli settlers have ample water > supplies. They have a swimming pool and their lush irrigated vineyards, herb > farms and lawns ‚Äì verdant even at the height of the dry season ‚Äì stand in > stark contrast to the parched and arid Palestinian villages on their > doorstep.\\" According to Shulman, for some decades they were subject, to many violent attacks, and settler recourse to both civil and military courts, to drive them out. The BBC broadcast film of settler youths beating an old woman and her family with cudgels to drive them away from their land, in 2008.Tim Franks, \\"West Bank attack filmed\\", BBC News 12 June 2008 Local villages, like Palestinian Susya, have been losing land, and being cut off from each other, as the nearby settlements of Carmel, Maon, Susya and Beit Yatir began to be built and developed, and illegal outposts established.Julie M. Norman, The second Palestinian Intifada: civil resistance, Taylor & Francis, 2010 p. 43.

According to Amnesty International, ten caves inhabited by Susya Palestinian families were blown up by the IDF in 1996, and some 113 tents were destroyed in 1998. Amnesty International also reports that official documents asking them to leave the area address them generically as 'intruders' (polesh/intruder).Amnesty International. Israel-rapport 17.09.2001 Most of the rain-catching water cisterns used by the local Palestinian farmers of Susya were demolished by the Israeli army in 1999 and 2001.

If they comply with the law they cannot build cisterns and collect even the rainwater. But if they fail to work their lands, they lose it anyway.David Hirst, \\"West Bank villagers' daily battle with Israel over water\\", The Guardian, 14 September 2011. One small enclave that remains for a Bedouin pastoralist's family suffers from further encroachment, with one settler, according to Shulman, managing to wrest 95% of the family's land, and still intent on entering the remainder.David D. Shulman, \\"Truth and Lies in South Hebron\\", Jewish Quarterly June 2013. \\"May 7th 2011. The settler in his Shabbat white, a huge knitted skullcap on his head, takes a pebble and holds it out on his fingertips to a Palestinian woman from Susya as he clucks his tongue at her, beckoning her as one would a dog. He has already taken 95% of the family's land, and now he bullies his way into the tiny patch that is left in order to harass and humiliate further. As if throwing a dog a bone, he tosses the pebble at her and laughs....\\" In a ruling delivered in December 2013, the Israel High Court of Justice accepted that Yatta Palestinians had shown their legal attachment to a stretch of land between Susya and the illegal settlement of Mitzpe Yair, but requested them to withdraw their petition against the settlers who are alleged to have illegally seized these lands. The subject of a petition concerns 300 dunams of agricultural land, and a further 900 dunams of pasture of which, the Palestinians argue, they were forced by violent attacks from using for agriculture and herding. The court held that the proper option open to the Palestinians was recourse to a civil legal action.Amira Hass, \\"High Court asks Palestinians to drop land case against settlers\\", Haaretz, 23 December 2013. Of the 120 complaints registered with Israeli police in Hebron by Palestinians of Susya, regarding alleged attacks, threats, incursions, and property damage wrought by settlers down to 2013, upwards of 95% have been dismissed, without charges being laid. =Legal fight & demolition orders= 250px After 1985, when the population was expelled, attempts by the Palestinian of Susya to rebuild their village have been razed by Israel four times, in 1991, 1997 and twice in 2001.Laurent Zecchini, \\"La colonisation isra√©lienne en marche √† Susiya, village palestinien de Cisjordanie\\", Le Monde 23 January 2012. Since it is classified within Area C of the West Bank, it lies under Israeli military occupation and control. Though they own much of the land, Israel denies building permits to Susya's residents and therefore they build without permission from Israeli authorities.Anne Barker, Palestinians fighting order to demolish their village in the West Bank, ABC News, Monday, 2 July 2012 The master plan for Susya was denied by the Israeli Civil Administration as opposed to the Israeli settlement of Susya, and Palestinians are required to obtain permits from the Israeli Civil Administration.\\"Palestinian village Khirbet Susiya under imminent threat of demolition and expulsion\\", B'tselem 7 May 2015: \\"The village residents requested the order as part of their petition to the court against the Civil Administration's decision to reject the master plan they had drawn up for the village. In the petition, Att. Qamar Mashraki from Israeli NGO Rabbis for Human Rights argued on behalf of the residents that their plan had been rejected for improper considerations, and that this constituted a double standard in planning and blatant discrimination against the Palestinian population. The state's treatment of Khirbet Susiya and its residents illustrates its systemic use of planning laws to prevent Palestinians in Area C, which is under full Israeli control, from construction and development that meet their needs: most Palestinians in the area live in villages where the Israeli authorities have refused to draw up master plans and connect them to water and power supplies, under various pretexts. With no other choice, the residents eventually build homes without permits and subsequently live under constant threat of demolition and expulsion. This policy is intended to serve the goal, explicitly declared by Israeli officials in the past, of taking over land in the southern Hebron hills in order to formally annex it to Israel in a permanent-status agreement with the Palestinians, and annex it de facto until such a time. In implementing this policy, Israel is acting in contradiction to its obligation to care for the needs of West Bank residents as the occupying power there.... The Israeli authorities' policy towards the residents of Khirbet Susiya starkly contrasts their generous planning policy towards Israeli settlers in the area. The settlers of Susiya and its outposts enjoy full provision of services and infrastructure and are in no danger of their homes being demolished ‚Äì despite the fact that the outposts are illegal under Israel law and in the settlement itself, according to figures published by settler organization Regavim, 23 homes were built on privately-owned Palestinian land.\\"\\"In shadow of settlement, Susiya villagers vow to fight displacement\\", Ma'an News Agency 4 June 2015.: \\"The small Palestinian village of Susya, located next to the southern Hebron Hills settlement of the same name, had no permits for its buildings either. And that's still the case, since last month the Civil Administration rejected Susya residents' request for approval of a master plan that would have made their homes legal...\\" In 2008 the Supreme Court turned down the villagers' request for a staying order on planned demolition. According to Shulman, the State attorney claimed that the Palestinians of Susya were a security threat to the settlers, and had to be moved. When asked by the judges where they would move to, the State replied:'We don't know. They are unfortunates, miskenim.'. In 2011, Israel executed 4 waves of demolition, affecting 41 structures, including 31 residential tents or shacks and two water cisterns. As a result, 37 people, including 20 children, were displaced and a further 70 affected. On 24 November 2011 bulldozers razed two tents where the Mughnem family dwells on their own land in Susya.Amira Hass, \\"Israeli demolition firm takes pride in West Bank operations\\", Haaretz, 28 November 2011 The Jewish settlers of Susya and the Israeli pro-settler association NGO Regavim petitioned the High Court to demolish Palestinian Susya, defining the villagers as 'trespassers' living in 'illegal outposts', terms usually applied to illegal Jewish outposts on the West Bank.Kate Laycock West Bank village struggles against demolition at Deutsche Welle, 5 July 2012. On 14 June an Israeli court issued 6 demolition orders covering 50 buildings including tent dwellings, ramshackle huts, sheep pens, latrines, water cisterns, a wind-and-sun powered turbine, and the German-funded solar panels in most of the Palestinian village of Susya. Over 500 people from Tel Aviv, Beer Sheva, and Jerusalem came to mount a peaceful protest on 22 June. On 26 June 2013, the Israeli Civil Administration, raided Palestinian Susya and handed out 40 demolition orders for many structures, tents, hothouses, a water well and a solar panel, established on humanitarian grounds by the European Union. Nearby Israeli settlers built two additional and unauthorized houses in the Mitzpeh Avigayil outpost, without interference.Chaim Levinson, \\"The end of an EU international sustainability project? Israel orders demolition of West Bank village's tents, solar panels\\", Haaretz, 27 June 2013. A local Palestinian declared to the Hebrew press: > They‚Äôre calling our village an illegal outpost. These lands are ours from > before there was a State of Israel. My father is older than your state‚Äîand I > am an illegal alien on my own land. I ask where is justice?

And now you want to expel this old man from his home > once again? To expel all of us who own these lands, who have lived on them > for generations in this space that is ours, which is all we know? In an exchange in the Knesset with Joint List Member Dov Khenin, who noted that Plia Albeck, a pro-settler former government official had admitted that in 1982 that Susya was surrounded by an Arab village, and that the land is registered at the Israeli Lands Authority as under private Arab title, a Rabbi from the Jewish Home Party, Deputy Defense Minister and new head of Israel's Civil Administration, Eli Ben Dahan, publicly denied that Susya exists, asserting that attempts to protect the village were a ploy by leftists to take over Area C. \\"There has never been an Arab village called Susya,\\" Ben Dahan said, calling the village \\"a ploy by leftist organizations to take over Area C [of the West Bank]\\". On 24 August, a further demolition took place. On 29 August 2012 the IDF destroyed a sheepfold and two tents, one a dwelling and the other for storage, donated to the villagers of Palestinian Susya by the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Amira Hass, \\"IDF razes Palestinian infrastructure in West Bank communities\\", Haaretz, 30 August 2012. In May 2015, the Israel High Court approved the demolition of Palestinian Susya. The implementation of the plan was expected to leave 450 villagers homeless.\\"Israeli court approves demolition of Palestinian village\\", Ma'an News Agency 4 May 2015. A delegation of diplomats from 28 European countries visited Susya in June and urged Israel not to evict its 300 Palestinian residents, a move that would endanger in their view the two-state solution. =International involvement= Israeli plans to demolish the Palestinian village have become an international cause c√©l√®bre.Peter Beaumont, \\"EU protests against Israeli plans to demolish Palestinian village\\", The Guardian 21 July 2015. According to Amira Hass, before fifteen senior EU diplomats visiting the area on 8 August 2012, Susya villager Nasser Nawaja'a complained that \\"(t)here are in this village octogenarians who are older than the State of Israel . . . How can they be told that their residence here is illegal?\\" The EU declared at the time it does not expect that the demolition order will be executed.Amira Hass, \\"EU: We expect Israel to cancel demolition orders for Palestinian villages in Area C of West Bank\\", Haaretz, 9 August 2012. An Israeli officer objected to this narrative, saying, \\"It would be absolutely false to present these people [the villagers] as having lived there since the time of Noah's Ark and suddenly the big bad Israelis come and destroy the place. We are a bit sad that some of the Europeans and the Americans are falling into that trap.\\" In July the US State Department urged Israel to refrain from any demolitions and asked it to seek a peaceful resolution with villagers,Itamar Sharon/JTA, \\"US warns Israel against demolishing Palestinian town\\", The Times of Israel 17 July 2015. and the European Union issued a strongly worded admonition urging Israel to abandon plans for the \\"forced transfer of population and demolition of Palestinian housing and infrastructure\\" in Khirbet Susiya. The EU funded the construction of buildings in Area C which is under interim Israeli jurisdiction, built without permits and which cost tens of millions of Euros. EU documents show the intention is to \\"pave the way for development and more authority of the PA over Area C\\". A spokesman said it was justified on humanitarian grounds while Ari Briggs, International Director of Regavim, said the project is a 'Trojan horse' with political aims. As of 2016 the existing infrastructure is the result of European aid: Spain donated the school, Germany provided solar panels; the water pumps were funded by Ireland, while Norway, Italy Belgium and other countries funded the children's playground, however, the makeshift shelters have \\"more the feeling of a protest camp than a functioning Palestinian village.'The author claims that the settler NGO Regavim's assertion that the people of Susya live in Yatta on the basis of the fact that Susya has 'no streets, shops or mosques, and no permanent homes. There do not seem to be many people, either.\\" Israeli settlement In 1982 the Israeli government together with the World Zionist Organization furnished a plan to establish a settlement on the site, part of 8 new settlements envisioned for the area, with funding of 20 million shekels providing for between 50 and 60 Jewish families.\\"Report of the Special Committee to investigate Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the population in the occupied territories\\", A/38/409 14 October 1983 UNISPAL, citing the Jerusalem Post 6 September 1982.

A major expansion began on 18 September 1999, when its boundaries expanded northwards and eastwards, with the Palestinian Shreiteh family allegedly losing roughly 150 more dunams. In 2008, the largest and most advanced goat pen and dairy was inaugurated at Susya with an investment of 3.5 million ILS. It can contain 1500 goats and milk 48 of them at a time. By Regavim's own calculations, by 2015, 23 Jewish/Israeli homes have been built on private Palestinian property in Susya.Chaim Levinson, \\"2,026 Settlement Homes Built on Private Palestinian Land, Right-wing Study Finds\\", Haaretz, 3 May 2015. Violence On 7 June 1991, Palestinians and an Israeli settler Baruch Yellin had a dispute over grazing rights. A Gush Emunim spokesman said Yellin shot one Palestinian dead after he had been attacked with sticks by a Palestinian. According to the Palestinian eyewitnesses, Jabar Hawad al-Nawajah was told not to graze near the settlement, and then Yellin rode off, returned with a M-16 rifle and shot a dozen of his sheep. A relative of the shepherd, Mahmoud al-Nawajah, came over to the scene and was then shot in the stomach and died.Peter Ford \\"Barbed Wire, Bullets Mark Israeli Push in West Bank\\", Christian Science Monitor 13 June 1991 The full circumstances were never clarified.Ami Pedahzur, Jewish Terrorism in Israel, Columbia University Press, 2011 p. 183.

The IDF then evicted the 300 Palestinians in the area, demolishing some of their makeshift homes. They have sought redress in an Israeli court, which ruled that illegal demolitions had taken place, the state had failed to provide procedures to enable the plaintiffs to obtain building permits, and was creating a situation in which elementary human rights to life were being denied.\\"The state admitted the demolition was executed illegally. Justice Procaccia said that 'the state did not establish a legal procedure which would allow for a building permit, hence the state is not carrying out its duties and is creating a situation under which a human's basic existence becomes impossible.' Justice Hayut pointed to the absurdity of the situation, saying 'the state admits an unauthorized action was carried out, which resulted in the demolition of structures that constituted the bare minimum in living conditions.

Since the mention was important in the process to be made an actual knight of the Military William Order, the Honorable Mentions were registered in the chapter of the Military William Order. In the first instance no decoration was associated with this Honorable Mention, although unofficially soldiers used a small decorative metal wreath worn above their other decorations and medals.

(j.g.) Harry R. Shawk, USNR, in charge. World War II service Allocated to the 12th Naval District, the net tender operated in a non-commissioned status in the San Francisco, area from the summer of 1941 to the winter of 1942, tending and laying the antisubmarine nets and booms protecting the waters of that important region. Assigned to the South Pacific Commissioned on 30 December 1942, Lt. Donald B. Howard, USNR, in command, Aloe departed San Francisco on 22 January 1943, bound for Pearl Harbor. Routed thence to New Caledonia, she reached Noumea on 18 March. Six days later, she got underway and proceeded via the New Hebrides, to the Solomon Islands. The net tender spent the remainder of the war in the Pacific Ocean, laying and tending torpedo nets and buoys, and conducting various salvage and towing operations. She ranged from New Caledonia to Okinawa and included the Solomon Islands, the Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Palau Islands in her itinerary. During this time, she was reclassified as a net layer, on 31 January 1944, her hull number becoming AN-6 on that date. While perhaps pedestrian, Aloe's duties were, nevertheless, vital and certainly not without hazard, as was dramatically demonstrated soon after she arrived in the Solomons in the spring of 1943. Under attack at Tulagi On 7 April of that year, she lay moored to the Sturgis Dock, Tulagi, when 67 \\"Vals\\" (Aichi D3A2 dive bombers), escorted by 110 \\"Zero\\" fighters‚Äîall but a very few of which had been drawn from the complements of four Japanese aircraft carriers‚Äîarrived to attack the shipping in the harbor there. The raid was a part of Admiral Yamamoto's Operation \\"I\\"‚Äîa series of massive air attacks aimed at American positions in the Solomons. Obviously interested in bigger game, the Japanese planes left Aloe alone, sinking destroyer and an oiler and damaging a second oiler and cargo ship. Nevertheless, the net tender, with her solitary 3-inch gun and her four .50-caliber machine guns, contributed to the antiaircraft barrage that helped to drive the attackers off, claiming one \\"Val\\" shot down, another \\"possibly\\" splashed, and a third \\"damaged.\\" Shooting down enemy planes in the Marianas A little over a year later, Aloe next encountered the enemy during Operation \\"Forager\\" ‚Äì the occupation of the Marianas. While in Task Group (TG) 53.16 on 18 June 1944, the net-layer was cruising east of Guam when Japanese planes attacked at 17:59. Utilizing local control and observing excellent fire discipline, Aloe's 20 mm and .50-caliber batteries scored hits on three enemy planes. Two of these Japanese aircraft crashed and the third departed the area in flames. Her last action with enemy planes came on 28 May 1945, while she was anchored in Nakagusuku Wan, Okinawa, serving as part of Net and Buoy Unit 3 (Task Unit 32.8.3). During that morning, she took a suicider under fire with all her guns as the kamikaze made a dive on the anchorage. Damaged in a typhoon War's end in August 1945, found Aloe still at Okinawa. While her battle with the Japanese may have been over, there were still the \\"elements\\" with which to contend. On 9 October 1945, a typhoon swept across Okinawa. During the storm, Snowbell (AN-52) inflicted minor damage on Aloe when the former drifted down on her. Snowbell's stern collided with Aloe's starboard bow and ripped a hole below the main deck level five feet long. Post-war inactivation Returning to the United States in the spring of 1946 via Saipan, Guam, the Marshalls, and Hawaii, Aloe commenced her pre-inactivation overhaul at Swan Island, Portland, Oregon, on 3 June 1946. Decommissioned on 3 August 1946 and placed in reserve on 26 September 1946, the net tender remained in the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, through the 1950s. Her name was stricken on 9 October 1962. Laid up in the U.S. Maritime Administration berthing area at Olympia, Washington, the ship was sold on 14 May 1971 to I. D. Logan and was scrapped. The USS Aloe is featured in a mural depicting the history of the Houghton area of Kirkland, Washington. Honors and awards Aloe received three battle stars for her World War II service.

Biography Diffee was born in Denton, Texas and grew up in Texas and North Carolina. The son of an airline pilot, he attended Bob Jones University, planning to become a Christian missionary. While at Bob Jones, he co-founded a comedy troupe, the Leaping Pickes, whose motto was, \\"We put the fun in fundamentalism.\\" Diffee's role in the group involved telling jokes, juggling and playing the banjo. He has a background in art and stand-up comedy, which he still performs from time to time. As a struggling artist, he took various day jobs, including road work, construction, and as a convenience store cashier. Diffee moved from Boston, Massachusetts to New York and began contributing to the New Yorker in 1999, after winning a cartoon contest the magazine and the Algonquin Hotel sponsored for an all-cartoon issue, in the process meeting Robert Mankoff, the cartoon editor, in person. Mankoff encouraged Diffee to contribute to the magazine. After three weeks of submission Mankoff chose one cartoon, which became Diffee's first published work. For the next year Diffee submitted fifteen cartoons per week; the magazine published a total of four. The next year Diffee sold eight cartoons to the magazine, each at the standard rate of $675. He remains a devout Christian, not consuming alcohol and refusing to draw cartoons about sex. Diffee's first book, The Rejection Collection, was a compilation of cartoons by various artists that had been rejected from the magazine along with questionnaires and portraits of each artist. In an interview he noted that 90% of even a successful freelance cartoonist's works are rejected, and that most cartoonists are known only for their work, not their personal lives. Many rejected cartoons are good, he explained, but inappropriate for the magazine because they are politically incorrect or sexually suggestive: \\"...the idea that the cartoonist did it, and actually pitched it to the New Yorker, makes it even funnier to me, like ‚Äòwhat were they thinking‚Äô?\\" As of the book's publication, the magazine had published more than 100 of Diffee's cartoons, a significant accomplishment for a young cartoonist. Matt Diffee presenting at Cusp Conference 2011, Chicago, Illinois Works His works are mostly single- panel satirical pieces. Diffee also produces other artwork, and has hosted \\"The Rejection Show\\", a monthly off-Broadway production devoted to rejected works by successful artists. He plays banjo and fiddle, and recently won a race in the sport of joggling (juggling while running), for which he will appear in an upcoming documentary. He currently hosts The Steam Powered Hour, a \\"smart and cozy night of bluegrass music, standup comedy, and cartoons.\\" Publications * * ReferencesExternal links *www.matthewdiffee.com - official site (links to Myspace page) *San Francisco Chronicle archive of works *New Yorker Store - \\"classic\\" cartoon of Che Guevara with Bart Simpson tee-shirt Category:American cartoonists Category:American satirists Category:People from Boston Category:People from Denton, Texas Category:Living people Category:The New Yorker people Category:Comedians from New York (state) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Matthew Diffee"},{"id":"18690995","text":"Sun Li (; born January 6, 1981 in Chongqing) is a female Chinese softball player.

BrƒÉtianu\\" National College is a comprehensive four-year public high school enrolling 1,200 students in grades 9 through 12. It is named after the Romanian politician Ion C. BrƒÉtianu. History The school opened in the fall of 1866 as the first teaching institution in the town of Pite»ôti and evolved throughout the years, from the original primary school to a secondary 8 grades school, then to a 12 grades one, and finally became a high-school (9-12 grades) in 1965. Today, \\"BrƒÉtianu\\" is recognized as one of the best high-schools in Romania. Because of its remarkable selectivity, the high admission percentage of its graduates, the very high overall GPA of its students and their excellent results in National Olympiads and other contests, in 1997 the \\"Ion C. BrƒÉtianu\\" High School was awarded the title of \\"National College\\" (Colegiu Na»õional). Main entrance to the Ion BrƒÉtianu National College. Curriculum The academic program is organized on a 2 shift schedule ‚Äì the morning shift and the evening shift. In accordance to the Romanian curriculum imposed by the Ministry, the students have a fixed weekly schedule that is repeated throughout the two semesters of the academic year. They are organized in groups of approximately 30 students and each of these groups has a certain classroom assigned to it. Students attend six ‚Äì 50 minutes classes daily. AP courses or Honors classes are mainly unknown to the Romanian system but their alternative is found in all highschools: special class profiles. Therefore, although the core curricula is imposed by the legislation of the Ministry, the highschool offers partially different kinds of classes depending on the profile chosen by each of the 30 students groups. The offered profiles refer to the class/classes that group should focus upon as it follows: * Mathematics-Informatics (4 Informatics, 4 Mathematics and 3 Physics classes/week) * Mathematics-Informatics, Intensive Studies (6-7 Informatics, 4 Mathematics and 3-4 Physics classes/week) * Mathematics- Informatics ‚Äì Bilingual (English/French/German)(7 English and 2 U.K. History & Geography classes/week, or the same for French or German) * Natural Sciences (3 Physics, 3 Biology and 3 Chemistry classes/week) * Social Sciences (4 Philosophy, 5 Romanian and 6 Foreign language classes/week) * Philology (2 Philosophy, 4 Romanian, 3 Latin and 4 Foreign language classes/week) * Philology ‚Äì Bilingual (English)(2 Philosophy, 4 Romanian, 3 Latin and 6 English classes/week) Grading and Ranking The grading system used is the Romanian numerical grading system, with grades ranging from 1 to 10, 10 being the maximum; 5 is the graduating mark. At the end of each semester and at the end of the year, the final grade is obtained through the arithmetic mean of the grades received throughout the year. Where term papers apply (Romanian, Mathematics, Physics, Informatics), this arithmetic mean is multiplied by 3 added with the term paper‚Äôs result and divided by 4 to obtain the final grade. An American style ranking system is not offered but each group of students calculates its own rank and awards diplomas for the highest 3 final grades, and at the end of the 12th grade the school awards the distinction of Chief of graduates to the student with the highest final grade over the four years. Standardized Testing The examination all Romanian students take when they graduate the high school studies is the Baccalaureate exam which consists of the following subjects: Romanian ‚Äì speaking and writing, a foreign language ‚Äì speaking, Mathematics, a science (the special profile assigned science ‚Äì if on a special profile class) and a social science. The graduating mark for the Baccalaureate is 6. Class of 2009 statistics The statistical data for the 2009 class are: *The final grade of the Chief of graduates : 10 *The average final grade : 9.29 *The percentage of Baccalaureate graduates : 99.71% *The highest Baccalaureate grade : 9.95 *The average Baccalaureate grade : 9.42 Mathematician Ciprian Manolescu, the only three-time winner of the International Mathematics Olympiad, attended BrƒÉtianu, as have other 7 international olympiad gold medallists in mathematics, biology, and physics. Romanian ex-President Emil Constantinescu as well as Prime Minister Armand CƒÉlinescu, Istrate Micescu, and Marshal Ion Antonescu also attended the high school. In arts the high school had many talents like the poets Ion Barbu and Ion Minulescu, Vladimir Streinu, George Valsan, the painters Costin Petrescu and Rudolf Schweitzer-CumpƒÉna, the writers Tudor Teodorescu Brani≈üte and George Ulieru, the composer Nicolae Br√¢nzeu or Robert Turcescu.

He wanted to spread it among Bengali masses which were then confined primarily to Santiniketan. On the advice of Shailaranjan Majumdar, he founded Dakshinee on 8 May 1948. Early days Dakshinee started with only 12 students. By 1955 it had 600 students. Between 1962 and 1972 the student strength was over 1500.

Publications *Rabindrasangeeter Dhara - Suvo Guha Thakurta wrote the book titled \\"Rabindrasangeeter Dhara\\" in 1950, about Tagore's compositions. In this book he classified Rabindrasangeet into 17 streams or ‚ÄòParjyay‚Äô, as opposed to only 4 streams or 'Parjay' in 'Geetabitan'. This classification helps to understand Rabindrasangeet and the philosophy behind it by analysing the intertwined poetry, the legacy of Hindustani classical music as well as Rabindranath's original creations.

In 1949 his Portsmouth side was tipped to become the first team to win the double but lost to Leicester City at Highbury. If Portsmouth won the Double he would have been the first skipper since John Devey to win it. Following his playing career, Flewin moved into coaching, first taking charge of Pompey's youth team, and later became assistant to manager Eddie Lever. He remained assistant manager at Portsmouth until October 1960, when he accepted the job as manager of Stockport County. In September 1963, he moved back south to become manager at Bournemouth, where he spent two years before resigning in 1965. After leaving football, Flewin settled on the Isle of Wight, where he managed the Fort Warden holiday camp in Totland Bay. He died in May 2008, aged 87 a week after the 2008 FA Cup Final.

With Whitey Lockman shifting to left field, Harris became the Giants' starting first baseman for the rest of the season. But he batted only .232 in 79 games played, and lost the starting job to future eight-time National League All- Star Bill White. Harris hit only .132 with the 1956 Giants and spent most of the season at Triple-A. In , the Giants' last season in New York City, White entered the military and opened up a spot for Harris as the team's backup first baseman.

On January 28, 1958, he was traded by the relocated San Francisco Giants to the Detroit Tigers with third baseman Ozzie Virgil for third baseman Jim Finigan and cash. Detroit Tigers The trade set up Harris' best MLB season. He began in a backup role to right-handed swinging Ray Boone. But in mid-June, with Harris hitting over .300, Detroit swapped Boone to the Chicago White Sox and Harris became the Tigers' starting first baseman. Appearing in a career-high 134 games, starting 112 at first base, he established career bests in runs (63), hits (123), extra-base hits (46, including his 20 homers), runs batted in (82), and batting average (.278). But he could not sustain that production in . Mired in a horrible early-season slump (as were the Tigers, who lost 15 of their first 17 games), Harris was hitting as low as .149 on May 22.

The following year, Norm Cash became the Tigers' everyday first baseman. After only eight games with Detroit, Harris was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 7 for outfielder Sandy Amoros. He spent the rest of and all of 1961 at Triple-A before leaving pro baseball. MLB career totals In 437 career MLB games and 1,331 at bats, Harris hit .240 lifetime with 189 runs batted in. His 320 hits included 38 doubles, 15 triples and 51 home runs. Retirement Following Harris' baseball career, he worked in insurance sales. He lived in Manassas, Virginia, and his son, Mark, played in the minors briefly and was a minor league instructor for the Kansas City Royals' organization.

Kerr) In May 1957, a group of Athens businessmen met to discuss starting a radio station located in Meigs County. Present at the meeting included Roger Jones, attorney; Roy Stephenson, accountant; Frank Rauch, bakery & theater owner; A.H. Kovlan, WATH Radio owner; and John E.M. Kerr, advertising manager for WATH. The group elected to form a corporation called Radio Mid-Pom, Inc. and applied for a broadcast license with the FCC for Meigs County. A search immediately followed to find a building and tower site in Meigs County. The group learned that the Bailey family in Bradbury was thinking of closing their restaurant. Radio Mid- Pom elected to purchase Bailey's Drive In and lease adjacent acreage for the tower. On August 28, 1959, WMPO 1390 started broadcasting with a staff of five people. An open house was held with both Pomeroy and Middleport mayors giving welcome speeches. In 1964, WMPO was granted permission to increase power to 5,000 Watts making it one of the strongest stations in the area. The years progressed well and in 1973, WMPO 1390 was granted permission for an FM station to broadcast on 92.1 with 3,000 Watts and a new wing was added to the station building. Ground was leased from Robert Burdett for the new tower. Throughout the period and expansion, two of the stockholders died and their stock was purchased by Jack Kerr and Frank Rauch. After 30 years of successful operation, the two remaining stockholders elected to sell the stations. E.T. Broadcasting of Dayton purchased WMPO in 1989. Ten years later, the station was sold to Positive Radio Group of Blacksburg, Virginia, the present owners.

These viruses infect plants in only two genera of the family Liliaceae: tulips (Tulipa) and lilies (Lilium). Also known as the tulip break virus, lily streak virus, lily mosaic virus, or simply TBV, Tulip breaking virus is most famous for its dramatic effects on the color of the tulip perianth, an effect highly sought after during the 17th-century Dutch \\"tulip mania.\\"Garber, Peter M., \\"Tulipmania\\", Journal of Political Economy, v. 97, 3, 1989, p. 535-560. Tulip breaking virus is a potyvirus ‚Äî a member of the group whose type species is potato virus Y. A distant serological relationship between Tulip breaking virus and tobacco etch virus was discovered in 1971.Bartels, Phytopathology Z., vol. 71, 1971, p. 87. Tulip breaking virus (TBV), tulip top-breaking virus (TTBV), tulip bandbreaking virus (TBBV), Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus (ReTBV), and lily mottle virus (LMoV) have all been identified as potyviruses by serology and potyvirus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, sequence analysis of amplified DNA fragments has classified them all as distinct viruses or strains; recently TTBV has been found to be strain-related to turnip mosaic virus. Effects of the virus The virus infects the bulb and causes the cultivar to \\"break\\" its lock on a single color, resulting in intricate bars, stripes, streaks, featherings or flame-like effects of different colors on the petals. These symptoms vary depending on the plant variety and age at the time of infection. Different types of colour-breaks depend on the variety of tulip and the strain of the virus. The color variegation is caused either by local fading, or intensification and overaccumulation of pigments in the vacuoles of the upper epidermal layer due to the irregular distribution of anthocyanin; this fluctuation in pigmentation occurs after the normal flower color has developed. Because each outer surface is affected, both sides of the petal often display different patterns. In the lily species, the virus causes mild to moderate mottling or streaking in the leaves about two weeks after inoculation, and then causes the plant to produce distorted leaves and flowers.Brierly, P.; Smith, F. F., \\"Study on lily virus diseases: the mottle group\\", Phytopathology: 34, 1944, p. 718. The virus also weakens the bulb and retards the plant's propagation through offset growths; as it progresses through each generation the bulb grows stunted and weak. Eventually it has no strength to flower, and either breaks apart or withers away, ending the genetic line. For this reason the most famous examples of tulips from color-broken bulbs ‚Äì the Semper Augustus and the Viceroy ‚Äì no longer exist. History Gouache on paper drawing, before 1640, of the Semper Augustus, famous for being the most expensive tulip sold during tulip mania. The effects of Tulip breaking virus are seen in the striking streaks of white in its red petals. Long thought to be the earliest recorded plant virus, it is now thought that TBV comes second; the earliest reference to a virus-induced leaf chlorosis (possibly tobacco leaf curl virus) was recorded in Japan in 752 AD.Brunt, Alan; Walsh, John, \\"'Broken' tulips and Tulip breaking virus\\", Microbiology Today, May, 2005, p. 71. \\"Breaking\\" symptomology was first described in 1576 by Carolus Clusius, a Flemish professor of Botany at Leiden, who noted the variegation, or \\"rectification\\", so termed because it was believed that with the offset production of an entirely new \\"broken\\" bloom the plant was distilling, or rectifying, itself into a pure life form. From p. 513: \\"Varia adeo multiplex est, ut difficile sit omnes eius differentias verbis exprimere. ‚Ä¶ leviter alium, per medium folium, aut summas oras, intercursante.\\" (The diversity is so very complicated that it's difficult to express in words all its differences. For when whatever seeds of the nascent tulips [that have been] cast off and buried by earth eventually sprout, very few [of them] completely retain the mother's original color, but the flowers transform into various colors (however, the largest portion [of seeds] deteriorate in the mud). Hence it be that one can see some [flowers], in part white, in part purple; others, in part red, in part yellow or gold; others, yellow or reddish, white, purple, or red, in which the colors are simultaneously mingled in such a way that, [although] each of the colors [be] otherwise separated, they are intermingled, radiating alternately; and [they are] either more intense or more dilute, or mingled together more closely or more sparsely, also sometimes just streaked with the other color; or slightly mingled with the other over the middle of the petal or along the upper edges [of the petals].)Clusius, Carolus, Rariorum aliquot stirpium, per Pannoniam, Austriam, & vicinas quasdam provincias observatarum historia, Antwerp, 1583. Clusius's observations continued; in 1585, he was the first to note that \\"broken\\" plants also slowly degenerated. \\" ‚Ä¶ any tulip thus changing its original colour is usually ruined afterwards and so wanted only to delight its master's eyes with this variety of colours before dying, as if to bid him a last farewell.\\"van Dijk, W., trans., A treatise on tulips by Carolus Clusius of Arras, Haarlem, Joh. Enschede en Zonen, 1951, p. 18. It was not known that the virus was responsible for this effect, so for centuries breeders believed that it was environmental conditions that attenuated the bulb and caused single colour tulips to break and streak. They tried to induce \\"rectification\\" through frequent soil changes (which causing the bulb to go to seed); varying the planting depths so the plant had to struggle in too much or too little soil; applying too much or too little manure; using soil that was either too poor or too rich; or storing the bulbs in exposed conditions so that they would be 'acted' upon by the rain, wind, sun, and extremes of temperature. However, as early as 1637 Dutch growers were able to produce new broken varieties through bulb grafting, by combining \\"broken\\" bulbs infected with the virus with healthy bulbs that produced uniformly colored flowers.Hoog,Gardener's Chronicle, 94: 471,1933. At the end of the eighteenth century, the notion that \\"breaking\\" in tulips was a manifestation of some kind of chronic disorder or weakness in the bulb was certainly considered among botanists; but it was still more or less believed that adverse environmental conditions were to blame. A comment by William Hanbury in 1770 that: \\"All variegations are diseases in a plant and nothing is so proper to bring this about as a defect in nutriment.\\"Hanbury, William, Complete Body of Planting and Gardening, vol. I, London, 1770, p. 301. bears out this general attitude. Given the lack of knowledge of human infectious diseases at this time (and well into the 19th century) this was not an unusual conclusion,Ackerknecht, E. H., \\"Anticontagionism Between 1821 and 1867\\", Bull. Hist. Med., vol. 22, 1948, p. 562-593. but what is surprising is that while tulip mosaic disease has a far more impressive and documented history than any other plant virus, the realization that it was a communicable plant disease, let alone a virus, came surprisingly late ‚Äì a decade after the end of World War I. \\"Plant virus\\" to plant pathologists at the time was almost synonymous with the tobacco mosaic virus, which had been discovered in 1897, quite soon after bacteriology had become established as an academic subject. Since the prime characteristics of the tobacco mosaic virus are that it damages the leaves and flowers of the plant, stunts growth, and lowers quantity and quality of the crop, it is puzzling to many academics and scientists that twenty more years passed before \\"breaking\\" was even suspected of being virus-induced.Wilkinson, Lise, The Development of the Virus Concept as Reflected in Corpora of Studies on Individual Pathogens, 3. Lessons of the Plant Viruses - Tobacco Mosaic Virus, p. 113-114. Pathogen discovery By the mid-1920s, biochemistry was coming into its own, and its impact was felt in virus research. Eventually, it was a series of bulb manipulation experiments begun in 1928 by Dorothy Cayley at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Merton, South London, England that led to the discovery of the virus. The record of Cayley's experiments are held at the Institution's current location in Norfolk. Caley discovered that by mechanically transferring infected tissue from broken bulbs to healthy bulbs during their dormant state, the virus that caused the break in color would also be transferred.Brunt, Alan; Walsh, John, \\"'Broken' tulips and Tulip breaking virus\\", Microbiology Today, May, 2005, p. 70. These experiments were further refined down to minute amounts, which led her to correctly conclude that the \\"virus or enzyme infection\\" was sap-transmissible, probably transferred by an insect, and the degree of breaking was proportional to the amount of infected tissue introduced.Cayley, Dorothy, \\"'Breaking' in tulips\\", Annals of Applied Biology, November, 1928, 15: p.529-539. The virus was eventually proved to be transferred in a non-persistent manner by at least four species of aphids, specifically Myzus persica (the most efficient), Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Doralis fabae and Aphis gossypii. McKenny-Hughes reported in 1934 that Yezabura tulipae transmitted the virus between stored tulip bulbs, but this has not been confirmed.van Slogteren, D.H., Descriptions of Plant Viruses: Tulip breaking virus, Bulb Research Centre, Lisse, The Netherlands, October, 1971 The transfer of the virus is non-persistent, which means it is accomplished through the insect feeding. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet in the insect's mouthparts, so that the next plant it feeds on is inoculated with the virus. The virus does not affect the seed that produces a bulb, only the bulb itself, its leaves and blooms, and its daughter offsets. It was not until the 1960s that TBV was shown to have flexuous filamentous particles (mostly measuring about 12√ó750 nm) and finally proved to be a virus. The genetic code of TBV has now been partially sequenced and the virus is recognized as a member of the genus Potyvirus (family Potyviridae). Like other members of the genus it is now readily detected and identified by serological, molecular and optical techniques. Viral strains Two separate strains of the virus ‚Äì Severe Tulip Breaking Virus (STBV) and Mild Tulip Breaking Virus (MTBV) ‚Äì have been determined by the type and severity of the symptoms they cause. In certain varieties STBV causes full breaking or light breaking, when due to a lack of anthocyanin, pigment present in the surface chromoplast cells fades and the lighter color (white or yellow) of the internal mesophyll is exposed, appearing as irregular streaks or fine featherings. In the same varieties MTBV causes self breaking or dark breaking, which occurs because anthocyanins are formed in excess, so the color in the epidermal cells is intensified in dark streaks or elongated flecks and sworls. Breaking commonly occurs along the edges and tops of petals and sepals. The most common type of breaking found in naturally infected plants, called average break, is caused by infection with a mixture of STBV and MTBV; both light breaking and dark breaking symptoms are present, together with some unbroken areas, in different parts of the same petal. Plants infected with a mixture of strains when young may exhibit both effects, with light breaking symptoms restricted to the basal part of the petal and severe dark breaking effects in the upper parts. Some varieties were later found to be incapable of light breaking, and always showed dark breaking symptoms no matter whether infected with STBV or MTBV or a mixture of both strains. Although they still can be infected, white and yellow flowered varieties are incapable of breaking since they lack anthocyanins; their color is determined by colourless or yellow plastids in the mesophyll. Other outward symptoms can include leaf mottling. Distribution Control of the virus is notoriously difficult. Its distribution is world-wide and had been reported in all temperate regions where tulips are grown; it is particularly common in southern Europe where the aphid vectors are abundant early in the growing season. Virus transmission by aphids causes millions of dollars of damage in the flower bulb sector annually. Mineral oils and pyrethroids are applied weekly during the growth season to decrease the virus transmission in flower bulbs, and current research projects are attempting to learn about the risk of non-persistent virus transmission in relation to aphid population dynamics.de Kock, M. J. D.; Stijger, C. C. M. M.; Pham, K. T. K.; Lemmers, M. E. C.; van Dam, M.; \\"Non-persistent TBV transmission in correlation to aphid population dynamics in tulip flower bulbs, ISHS Acta Horticulturae 901: XII, International Symposium on Virus Diseases of Ornamental Plants, July, 2011. Most recently, population dynamics of aphids in tulip fields were monitored during three growing seasons. Simultaneously, the period of TBV transmission by aphids was investigated experimentally by exposing small tulip plots during specified intervals to naturally occurring aphids. Finally, timing of virus spread was correlated with aphid population dynamics and weather conditions. In 2007 it was discovered that TBV transmission started in April, while the first aphids were not found until May. Apparently, the first aphids of the season had already contributed, in great extent, to the virus transmission, which was observed locally in the tulip plots. In addition, a second, but distinct, TBV isolate was identified, which resulted in the design of an improved TBV detection assay. These results should enable formulation of crop protection guidelines that are fine-tuned with the risk of virus transmission, which will help decrease environmental damage caused by pesticides. In an effort to restrict the virus, the United States, Great Britain and other countries prohibit the commercial sale of broken bulbs, or bulbs known to be infected by the virus. As TBV-infected bulbs gradually degenerate, the virus can be minimized by removing and destroying 'broken' bulbs quickly before aphids spread the virus to other bulbs or cross-contaminating lily hosts. Broken tulips today Today, tulips like Rem's Sensation displaying a \\"broken\\" effect are stable variants and the result of breeding, not viral infection,Royal Horticultural Society ‚Äì Gardening Advice: Tulip Viruses although many tulip fanciers feel these \\"modern\\" variants are a poor substitute when compared to the long-extinct rare cultivars like Semper Augustus. Modern tulip varieties infected with the virus are fragile, and are usually much smaller than normal healthy blooms, with a reduced stem length. There are only a few varieties of older, truly \\"broken\\" tulips still in existence such as zomerschoon, but only because the worst aspects of the virus have somehow remained benign. One such example is the rare Absalon, which dates from 1780; a \\"bizarre\\" colored variety, it displays gold flames against a dark chocolate brown background.

Currently, a chain of lakes and reservoirs and the shallow irrigation Kuma-Manych Canal are found along this route. The canal is intended to provide a shorter route for shipping than the existing Volga‚ÄìDon Canal system of waterways; it would also require fewer locks (or lower-rise locks) than the Volga-Don route. Manych Ship Canal is the existing canal system that would be the likely route for the Eurasian Canal.  Potential shipping route  Kuma-Manych Depression and Manych River from space. Upper left is the eastern tip of the Sea of Azov and lower right is the Caspian Sea. Upper right is the lower Volga and lower left is a reservoir on the Kuban River. Note that the Manych joins the Don River before that river reaches the Sea of Azov. The route of the canal, as usually proposed, would follow the thalweg (the lowest-ground line) of the Kuma-Manych Depression. From the Caspian Sea westward, the canal route would follow: * The lower course of the Kuma River (a shallow, partly dry river which flows toward the Caspian), on the border of Dagestan and Kalmykia * A new canal through the steppe, possible following a section of the present Kuma-Manych Canal (an irrigation canal bringing water from the Terek River and the upper Kuma River to the East Manych), * The East Manych, * The West Manych, which flows toward the lower Don via Lake Manych- Gudilo, Proletarsk, Vesyolovsk, and Ust'-Manych Reservoirs. A shallow (1.3 m) navigable waterway already exists there. * From the confluence point of the West Manych and the Don, the ships would follow the same route as used by the existing Caspian-to-Black Sea navigation, i.e., less than 100 km down the Don until its fall into the Sea of Azov, and then across the Sea of Azov and the Strait of Kerch into the Black Sea.  Locks  As the highest point of this route is only 27 meters above the level of the Sea of Azov and 54 m above that of the Caspian Sea, the preliminary design presented by the Hydraulic Facilities Safety Expert Center \\"GIDROTEKHEXPERTIZA\\" (–≠–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –ø–æ –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π \\"–ì–∏–¥—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ö—ç–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä—Ç–∏–∑–∞\\")–ü—Ä–æ–∂–µ–∫—Ç –Ω–µ—á–∏—Å—Ç–æ–π –≤–æ–¥—ã. –í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –î–ê–ù–ò–õ–û–í-–î–ê–ù–ò–õ–¨–Ø–ù (Includes a map of the proposed route) proposes the construction of three to four low-rise ship locks on the western slope and three mid-rise or six low-rise locks on the eastern slope. The option involving the construction of six low-rise locks on the eastern slope of the watershed can significantly reduce the volume of earthwork and lower by one- third the need for freshwater, which is precalculated as approximately 1.5 cubic km. This compares favorably with the 13 locks of the existing Volga-Don Canal, where ships use nine locks to rise 88 m from the Volga to the canal's highest point, and then four more locks to descend 44 m to the Don's Tsimlyansk Reservoir.  Water supply  The Kuma-Manych depression area is quite arid, with annual precipitation no more than 400 mm (in the western section) and 200 mm (in the eastern section).Ivan Krymov, \\"–û—Ç –ö–∞—Å–ø–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–æ—Ä—è –∫ –ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–º—É\\" (From the Caspian to the Black Sea). Morskiye Vesti, 2008. To operate this shipping canal with locks, a significant additional supply of freshwater would be necessary. Three options for its provision are being considered: * The route of the abandoned Volga-Chogray Canal across Kalmykia. Construction of this canal was started in the late Soviet era, but later abandoned . This time, it is proposed to reduce water loss by building a concrete-lined canal, or possibly even a pipeline, along this route. * Pumping water from the mouths of the Volga to the eastern end of the canal (presumably, along a pipeline that would follow the Caspian coast), and then uphill along the eastern section of the canal. * Increasing the water flow of the irrigation canals that already bring Kuban and Terek water to the West and East Manych, such as the Nevinnomyssk Canal, the Terek-Kuma Canal and the Kuma-Manych Canal. The idea is to make better use of the overflow water during floods on the Kuban and Terek. It is expected that this plan would alleviate the problem of frequent inundations on these rivers. Supplying the Manych Waterway with freshwater from the Volga using the first or second option can compensate the Sea of Azov for the volume of freshwater that is now lost by the Don River to the locks of the Volga-Don Ship Canal.  History  The Soviet government decided to construct the Manych Waterway connecting the Black and Caspian Seas via the Kuma-Manych Depression in May 1932. In the same year construction started in the West Manych River Valley. According to the 1936 construction project, the shipping route consisted of three sections. The first, western, section from the Don River to the Chogray Reservoir on the East Manych, 448 km long, was planned as a cascade of reservoirs; the second section ‚Äì from the Chogray Dam to the Kuma River ‚Äì was to be built as a canal with a water depth of 3 m, bottom width of 67 m, and length of 73 km. The third, eastern, section, 150 km long, was intended as a free-flow navigable and irrigation canal (along the lower course of the Kuma) reaching a port on the Caspian coast. Of these three sections, only the first was ever built. By 1941, the cascade of dams on the West Manych was completed. It created three reservoirs, in the following (east to west) order: Proletarsk (Proletarskoye) Reservoir (–ü—Ä–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–µ), 150 km long, Vesyolovsk (Vesyolovskoe) Reservoir (–í–µ—Å—ë–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–µ), 100 km long, and Ust'-Manych (Ust'-Manychskoye) Reservoir (–£—Å—Ç—å-–ú–∞–Ω—ã—á—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–µ), 62 km long.West Manych (Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences) The uppermost reservoir of the cascade, the Proletarskoye, is in fact connected with the source of the Western Manych, Lake Manych-Gudilo, the Proletarsk dam raising the water level in the lake. This system of reservoirs and ship locks creates the so-called Manych Waterway, 329 km long but only 1.3 m deep. It is still used for shipping, but on a very minor scale. With the outbreak of the Second World War further construction of the Manych Ship Canal was suspended. After the war, destroyed or damaged dams and locks of the shipping canal were reconstructed, but the plans for continuing the construction further eastward were canceled, since the much deeper Volga-Don Shipping Canal was built instead, and the existing demand for freight transport did not justify a second canal between the Caspian and the Black/Azov Sea basins. Further east, on the East Manych River (which flows east), the Chogray Reservoir, 48.8 km long, was constructed in 1969-1973, but at that time the focus was on irrigation, not shipping.  Recent developments  The Russian government's interest in improvement of the waterways between the Caspian basin and that of the Azov and Black Seas - which may or may not involve the Eurasia Canal route - is due to the increasing volume of cargo traffic between the Volga-Caspian basin and European countries, as well as the inadequacy of existing facilities on the Volga-Don Canal for handling the expected cargo flows. The proponents of the project refer to a study of freight shipping in southern Russia by the Central Research Institute of Economy and Water Transport Exploitation (, ), a research center of Russia's Ministry of Transport.CNIIEVT and the development of Russia's inland water transport This study predicts significant growth in the demand for freight transportation, in particular for liquid cargoes, between the Caspian region and the ports of southern and central Europe. The study also suggests that a significant amount of cargo shipped between the Asian countries and western Europe can be redirected to the canal as well.\\"–ö–ê–ù–ê–õ '–ï–í–†–ê–ó–ò–Ø': –ó–ê–ß–ï–ú –ò –°–ö–û–õ–¨–ö–û?\\" (\\"Eurasia Canal: why, and at what cost?\\"), by Yulia Alekseeva.

Biography Born November 24, 1887, Nettie McBirney earned a home economics degree from the Stout Institute in Menomonie, Wisconsin. She moved to Claremore, Oklahoma in 1909 to teach home economics. Two years later, she became supervisor of home economics at Muskogee schools. After marrying Sam P. McBirney, coach of the University of Tulsa football team and vice president of the National Bank of Commerce, she settled in Tulsa in 1916. In 1935, she approached Tulsa World editor N.G. Henthorne about writing a cooking column that contained simple advice and taught cooking techniques. \\"Kitchen Log\\" ran five times a week in the World through 1955. She also became a demonstration chef, first at Vandever's Department Store and other stores in Tulsa, and later in many other parts of the country. McBirney began inventing kitchen aids during the Depression, such as a non-stick pastry canvas and rolling pin cover and a pie pan that promised perfect bottom crusts on pies. The invention she became best known for was her Cooky Molding Cutter, now known as Gramma's Cutter, a cookie cutter designed to easily release the molded cookie dough and maintain a 3-D appearance. She began selling them in 1948 and they quickly caught on; Princess Margaret purchased a set of the cookie cutters for Prince Charles in 1952, and Wrigley purchased, then sold 70,000 sets as a special promotion the same year.

The Battle of Acajutla was a battle on June 8, 1524, between the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado and the standing army of Cuscatlan Pipils, an indigenous state, in the neighborhood of present-day Acajutla, near the coast of western El Salvador.  Antecedents  Hern√°n Cort√©s, after conquering the city of Tenochtitlan, capital of the Aztec empire, delegated the conquest of the territories southward to his lieutenant Pedro de Alvarado, who set out with 120 horsemen, 300 foot soldiers, and several hundred Cholula and Tlaxcala auxiliaries. After subduing the highland Mayan city-states of present-day Guatemala through battle and co-optation, the Spanish sought to extend their dominion to the lower Atlantic region of the Nahuat-speaking people whom his translators called Pipils, then organized as the powerful state of Cuzcatl√°n. The Kaqchikel Mayans, who had long been rivals of Cuscatl√°n for control over their wealthy cacao-producing region, joined forces with Alvarado's men and supported his campaign. Accompanied by thousands of Kaqchikel warriors, Alvarado then marched on Cuscatl√°n. The army arrived at the present territory of El Salvador, across the Paz River, on June 6, 1524. Receiving word of the approaching Spanish forces, the Nahuat peasants who lived nearby fled.  Battle  On June 8, 1524, the conquerors arrived in the neighborhood of Acajutla at a village called Acaxual. There, according to records, a battle ensued between the opposing armies, with the Nahuat wearing cotton armor (of three fingers' thickness, according to Alvarado) and carrying long lances. This circumstance would be crucial in the progression of the battle. Alvarado approached the Pipil lines with his archers' showers of crossbow arrows, but the natives did not retreat. The conquistador noticed the proximity of a nearby hill and knew that it could be a convenient hiding place for his opponents. Alvarado pretended that his army had given up the battle and retreated. The Pipils suddenly rushed the invaders, giving Alvarado an opportunity to inflict massive losses. The Pipils that fell to the ground could not get back on their feet, hindered by the weight of their cotton armor, which enabled the Spanish to slaughter them. Decimated, the Nahuat forces retreated to reassemble further along his route. In a second battle a few days later, the remaining formal Cuscatlan army again assembled on the battlefield but was finally defeated. In the words of Alvarado: \\"...the destruction was so great that in just a short time none were left alive...\\". In the battle, Alvarado was struck by a sling shot to his thigh which fractured his femur. According to later tradition, the stone that hit the conquistador was hurled by a Nahuat-Pipil \\"Tatoni\\" (a prince) called Atonal but, Spanish chronicles do not specify the archer and \\"Atonal\\" appears to have been mythologized as Atlacatl. The resulting infection lasted about eight months and left Alvarado partially crippled, with one leg shorter than the other. In spite of this wound, he continued the campaign, marching with his army into the capital of Cuscatlan where he assumed authority and enslaved many residents. The remaining Nahua resistance operated from the mountains where his forces could not engage them effectively, and the Nahua were still undefeated when Alvarado returned to Mexico. They would finally be defeated a decade later, with the second Spanish invasion.

The word byeol literally means star, but also has the meaning of special. Founding of the army was initiated by Yun Gwan during the reign of king Sukjong of Goryeo. The army was put together to fight the Jurchen who were putting pressure on Goryeo's northern borders. The Goryeo infantry had a hard time resisting the strong Jurchen cavalry. Organization The Byeolmuban army had six divisions: Yun Gwan's regular army and Armor Guards called Jeonggyugun (Ï†ïÍ∑úÍµ∞, Ê≠£Ë¶èËªç) Infantry called Sinbogun (Ïã†Î≥¥Íµ∞, Á•ûÊ≠•Ëªç), Cavalry called Sin-gigun (Ïã†Í∏∞Íµ∞, Á•ûÈ®éËªç), an army of Buddhist monks called Hangmagun (Ìï≠ÎßàÍµ∞, ÈôçÈ≠îËªç), Supporting troop made of slaves called Yeonhogun (Ïó∞Ìò∏Íµ∞,ÁÉüÊà∂Ëªç), and volunteered soldiers made of merchants and ordinary citizens called Jubugunhyeon (Ï£ºÎ∂ÄÍµ∞ÌòÑ, Â∑ûÂ∫úÈÉ°Á∏£). Combating troops were divided into Assassin/Spies called Sinbo (Ïã†Î≥¥, Á•ûÊ≠•), Siege Engineers called Dotang (ÎèÑÌÉï, Ë∑≥Ëï©), Archers called Gyeonggung (Í≤ΩÍ∂Å, Ê¢óÂºì), Builders called Jeongno (Ï†ïÎÖ∏, Á≤æÂº©), Ballistic/Cannon gunners called Balhwa (Î∞úÌôî, ÁôºÁÅ´), and special force called Teugibudae (ÌäπÍ∏∞Î∂ÄÎåÄ, ÁâπÊäÄÈÉ®Èöä). They were to be trained and maintain/make weapons & fight with regular army. During the second year of king Yejong of Goryeo's reign the byeomuban, consisting of 17,000 soldiers, attacked Jurchen and killed approximately 5,000 Jurchen troops, detained another 5,000 POWs and 350 Jurchen tribal clans and took over their territory by building nine fortresses at Hamju region. Fortresses were called Northeastern Nine Fortresses, and they are in Hamju (Ìï®Ï£º, Âí∏Â∑û), Yeongju (ÏòÅÏ£º, Ëã±Â∑û), Ungju (ÏõÖÏ£º, ÈõÑÂ∑û), Bokju (Î≥µÏ£º, Á¶èÂ∑û), Gilju (Í∏∏Ï£º, ÂêâÂ∑û), Gongheomjin, (Í≥µÌóòÏßÑ, ÂÖ¨ÂíΩÈé≠), Sungnyeong (Ïà≠ÎÖï, Â¥áÂØß), Tongtae (ÌÜµÌÉú, ÈÄöÊ≥∞), and Jinyang (ÏßÑÏñë, ÁúûÈôΩ).

The brigade was initially formed as a part-time militia formation in the early 1900s in Victoria. In 1914, the brigade was re-constituted as part of the AIF. The brigade first saw action while serving with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps during the Gallipoli campaign where they were noted for their attack during the Battle of the Nek. After being withdrawn to Egypt in February 1916 they were involved in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign until the end of the war. They were attached to a number of different formations being part of the Anzac Mounted Division in March 1916 and the Australian Mounted Division in June 1917, who they remained with until the end of the war. After the war, the AIF light horse regiments were demobilised and disbanded; however, the brigade briefly existed as a part-time militia formation in New South Wales until 1921 when its regiments were reorganised into cavalry brigades. History=Early formation The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was initially raised as part of the militia in the early 1900s, being formed sometime between 1902 and 1905. That formation was raised in Victoria, and consisted of three Australian Light Horse regiments ‚Äì the 7th, 8th and 9th ‚Äì all of which bore the territorial designation of the Victorian Mounted Rifles. The 7th was based in several locations including Seymour, Broadford and Mansfield; the 8th was based in Wangaratta, Rutherglen, Beechworth and other smaller centres; and the 9th was based in Echuca, Ballarat, Bendigo and several other smaller depots. In 1912, an Army-wide reorganisation resulted in some regimental designations being redistributed. At this time, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was reconstituted in New South Wales, and consisted of the 7th (New South Wales Lancers), 9th (New South Wales Mounted Rifles) and the 11th (Australian Horse). The 7th was based around Parramatta, Sydney, Penrith and Windsor; the 9th was centred around Sydney, Camden, and Dubbo, with several other minor depots; and the 11th was based at several depots including Goulburn, Cooma, and Bega, New South Wales. World War IFormation and service at Gallipoli= At the outbreak of the war August 1914 the Australian Government decided to raise the all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF) consisting of 20,000 troops comprising an infantry division and a light horse brigade of three regiments to be used at the discretion of Britain. These regiments were raised from volunteers for overseas service, as the provisions of the Defence Act did not allow conscripts to be deployed overseas. Nevertheless, many of the recruits were drawn from the various militia light horse formations created as a consequence of the Kitchener Report 1910 and the introduction of Universal Training, although they were assigned to freshly raised units that were separate to the light horse regiments raised as part of the militia. Initial enlistments outstripped expectations and, as a result, a total of three light horse brigades were created in the early part of the war, each comprising three regiments, a machine gun squadron, a field ambulance, a veterinary section, supply, artillery and other supporting sections. As well, two divisional cavalry regiments were formed. An officer from the 8th Light Horse Regiment, Egypt, 1915 The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was raised as part of the 3rd Contingent that was hastily put together at the beginning of October 1914. Brigade headquarters opened in Melbourne in early November, with equipment issuing, training and troop organisation beginning at Broadmeadows on 6 November. The brigade was organised into three regiments ‚Äì the 8th, 9th and 10th ‚Äì each consisting of approximately 520 fighting men organised into three squadrons. The 8th was recruited from Victoria, the 9th from Victoria and South Australia, and the 10th from Western Australia. These units were raised throughout September and October, and the brigade embarked for the Middle East in late 1914 and early 1915. After arriving in Egypt in February ‚Äì March 1915, the brigade undertook training at Mena Camp. Training focused initially on individual skills, before progressing to collective training at squadron, regimental and eventually brigade level. The brigade's first commander was Colonel (later Brigadier General) Frederic Godfrey Hughes, a pre-war officer in the part-time militia. During the early part of the war, the brigade was attached to the New Zealand and Australian Division. In mid-May 1915, the brigade was deployed to Gallipoli as reinforcements for the infantry that had landed in April, who had become pinned around a small perimeter around a beachhead at Anzac Cove; deployed in a dismounted role, the brigade was assigned as corps troops directly under the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. About a quarter of the strength of each light horse regiment remained in Egypt with their horses; however, additional reinforcements were provided prior to their arrival at Gallipoli, to bring them up to strength. Although there were concerns about the age of the brigade's commander, upon arrival, the brigade was assigned to hold part of the defensive perimeter that had been established around the beachhead at Anzac Cove. The regiments were pushed into the line around Walker's Ridge and Russell's Top, assuming control of positions previously held by the New Zealanders, and undertook mainly defensive roles throughout the remainder of the campaign. During this time, the light horsemen undertook patrolling operations, manned outposts, carried out sniping and worked to dig trenches and lay down wire obstacles. Troopers from the 9th Light Horse Regiment, Gallipoli, 1915 In August, the Allies attempted to break the deadlock on the Gallipoli peninsula, launching the August Offensive in an effort to secure the heights around Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Baby 700. During this effort, the 8th and 10th Light Horse Regiments took part in the attack at the Nek on 7 August, while the 9th was placed in reserve. Planned as a feint to draw attention away from efforts elsewhere, the attack proved costly for the light horsemen. Due to poor coordination, efforts to support the attack broke down, and the preparatory artillery barrage ended before the attack began, allowing the defending Ottoman troops to return to their firing positions before the first wave set out. Attacking across the narrow front, the first wave of 150 men were all killed or wounded shortly after leaving their trenches. Nevertheless, three more waves were pushed forward before the attack was halted. Total casualties in the two regiments amounted 234 killed and 138 wounded. On 27 August, the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments were sent as reinforcements to support the attack on Hill 60, which secured a link between Anzac Cove and Suvla. For his actions during this battle, Lieutenant Hugo Throssell later received the Victoria Cross. For the remainder of the campaign, the brigade undertook defensive duties. Hughes became ill late in the Gallipoli campaign and was evacuated. In his stead, the brigade major, John Antill, assumed command of the brigade in early October 1915. By mid-December all three regiments were withdrawn from the peninsula, as part of the general withdrawal that followed the decision to abandon the position. The brigade was tasked with holding the line while the evacuation took place; a party of 40 men from the 8th Light Horse Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Maygar were among the last to leave. They were subsequently returned to Egypt, sailing via Mudros. =Sinai and Palestine campaign= After the evacuation from Gallipoli, the Australian and New Zealand forces in the Middle East were reorganised. There were a large number of reinforcements that had arrived in Egypt at this time, and while the infantry was to be deployed to the Western Front, the mounted units were to remain in the Middle East. This resulted in the establishment of the Anzac Mounted Division, which consisted of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, under the command of Major General Harry Chauvel. At this time, the brigade was provided with a British Territorial horsed artillery battery, the 1/1st Inverness-shire Battery, which was detached from the British IV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). Until July 1916, the brigade was supported by a machine gun section, but this was then expanded to a full squadron, equipped with 12 machine guns. A light horse training regiment was also established for each brigade, to provide trained reinforcements, while other supporting elements including signals, logistic, engineer, medical and veterinary support units were also assigned. The 9th Light Horse Regiment crossing the Suez Canal, February 1916 In the early part of 1916, the brigade was employed in a defensive capacity to prevent an Ottoman attack on the Suez Canal, working to the east of the canal. In late March, the 8th Light Horse Regiment undertook a reconnaissance patrol to Muksheib to ascertain available water supplies there. While the defences were built up in the north, the light horsemen undertook a series of raids in the southern Sinai, to channel the Ottoman troops towards the main defensive positions. These raids were tasked with attacking outposts and destroying water sources. Over the period 11‚Äì14 April, a squadron from the 9th Light Horse Regiment, along with a small number of men from the 8th Light Horse Regiment, undertook a raid on Jifjafa, advancing east of the Suez Canal to attack a bore drilling site; the raid proved successful and resulted in the destruction of the well and capture of the small Ottoman garrison force. By late July an attack on the canal was expected, and the mounted troops were deployed to harass the advancing Ottoman forces. On the night of 3‚Äì4 August, the Battle of Romani began when an Ottoman force ran into positions occupied by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was in the No. 2 Section of the canal zone during the initial fighting at Romani, but was hurriedly pushed forward to Dueidar, although this proved too slow to press the advantage. Tasked with a flanking role, the brigade was ill-prepared for this action, lacking the experience of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, and deploying without necessary combat clothing and equipment; late in the afternoon on 5 August, the brigade attacked an Ottoman strongpoint to the south of Katia around Hamisah, capturing over 400 prisoners and a quantity of equipment, including several machine guns. After the main fighting at Romani, the brigade was involved in flanking operations around Hod el Sagi, and then later supported the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade during the Battle of Bir el Abd on 9 August, tasked with advancing to Salmana on the El Arish road, in an effort to threaten the Ottoman left flank. The Ottoman defences proved too strong, though, and initial efforts by the brigade proved slow. The troopers advanced on horseback, attempting to rush the defences, but defensive fire checked their efforts and forced them to dismount. Using fire and manoeuvre techniques, a general advance began but it was carried out over too narrow a front, and after two hours was subjected to a heavy counter-attack. This triggered a withdrawal, during which a heavy artillery bombardment killed many of the 8th Light Horse Regiment's horses that were being led back by hand. In response, the 10th Light Horse Regiment was pushed forward to assist the 9th, and they succeeded in shoring up the line. The heavy resistance resulted in the Anzac Mounted Division being withdrawn to Oghratina, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade held the left flank around Hod Abu Dhahab overnight. The 8th Light Horse Regiment at Romani Command of the brigade passed to John Royston after Antill was selected to command an infantry brigade on the Western Front. Meanwhile, the brigade continued operations against the Ottoman rearguard elements, and by 12 August the oasis area had been cleared. The brigade remained in the forward areas until 21 August. A period of patrolling and small scale raids followed as the front was slowly advanced towards the frontier with Palestine. By the end of the year, the British Empire forces were in a position to undertake an advance into the eastern Sinai, following the establishment of a railway and pipeline through the northern Sinai. In late December, the brigade took part in the Battle of Maghdaba, after a advance across the desert. On 23 December, the brigade carried out a flanking move to the north of the town, to cut off the garrison, while other elements of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked from the north-west. The attack was heavily resisted, and the Australians lack artillery support to suppress the defenders; late in the day, as water for the horses became a concern the order was given for the Australians withdraw. At the last moment, elements from the 1st Light Horse Brigade secured a redoubt to the north-west, while the 10th Light Horse Regiment moved around the eastern flank and took two positions to the south. This triggered the collapse of the Ottoman defence and allowed for a general advance. In early January 1917, another action was fought to capture Rafa. Initially, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was held back in reserve, but as the dismounted attack stalled, they too were committed. At the point that the attack broke down, the New Zealanders captured one of the redoubts which proved to be the key to unlocking the Ottoman defence. Once the town was captured, Chauvel withdrew the bulk of his forces towards El Arish to replenish supplies and rest, and to keep them out of range of Ottoman reinforcements; meanwhile, two regiments from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade formed a rearguard to delay the Ottomans and prevent them from retaking Rafa. In February and March 1917, the Desert Column was reorganised and expanded. The arrival of several brigades of British yeomanry troopers from Salonika resulted in the decision to raise a new division, the Imperial Mounted Division. In order to bolster these troops with an experienced element, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was transferred from the Anzac Mounted Division to the newly formed Imperial Mounted Division. At this time, the Inverness-shire Battery remained with the Anzac Mounted Division, and the brigade subsequently received the 1/1 Nottingham Battery, which was detached from the XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). The focus for the brigade's operations throughout 1917 was the capture of the town of Gaza. The First Battle of Gaza was fought on 26 March. During the attack, the Imperial Mounted Division was tasked with forming a screen to encircle the town and protect the infantry attack from reinforcements; however, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was detached from the Imperial Mounted Division to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division's attack to the north-west of the town, around El Meshaheran and El Mineh, in the early afternoon. Later, when the screen requested reinforcements after coming under attack from Ottoman reinforcements, the 8th and 9th Light Horse Regiments were sent back and secured some of the high ground to the north- west, which helped stabilise the line around Hill 405. The 10th Light Horse Regiment, forming the divisional reserve, also helped fill a gap in the line late in the day. Despite some progress in entering the town, the attempt to capture Gaza failed when the order to withdraw was given as night fell due to concerns about the arrival of Ottoman reinforcements. 9th Light Horse Regiment troopers in a firing line during the Second Battle of Gaza A second attempt at capturing Gaza came on 19 April. In the days before the attack, the brigade undertook reconnaissance work near Wadi el Ghuzze. The Ottoman position was located about inland from the coast, around the edge of the dunes. It was strongly defended and despite efforts to reinforce the attack with tanks and gas, the direct attack proved costly and unsuccessful. The Imperial Mounted Division was heavily committed, undertaking several dismounted attacks against two south-eastern redoubts, during which the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was sent against Atawineh. Coming under heavy fire, the dismounted troopers advanced close to the redoubt and secured a number of prisoners before being halted by defensive fire and ordered to halt. Elsewhere, the infantry attack stalled, despite some gains, and eventually, with darkness falling and ammunition running low, the attack was called off. In June, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division, and a new Yeomanry Mounted Division was created as the Desert Column was expanded to a full corps, the Desert Mounted Corps. In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Gaza, British planners decided to attempt an indirect approach, focusing their efforts on Beersheba, about from Gaza in an effort to turn the Ottoman flank. On 30 October, the Battle of Beersheba was fought. Shortly before the battle, Brigadier General Lachlan Chisholm Wilson took command of the brigade. During the fighting, the 8th Light Horse Regiment provided a screen, the rest of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was detached from the Imperial Mounted Division to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division attack the high ground around Tel el Saba; this took most of the day, but ultimately helped set the conditions for the 4th Light Horse Brigade's charge. Late in the afternoon, the brigade was sent to assist the attack from the east, where resistance continued until late in the day when the garrison began to flee, resulting in the capture of the town and most of its vital water wells. The breakthrough at Beersheba paved the way for the opening of the Southern Palestine Offensive; after Gaza was captured, the brigade took part in the pursuit of the withdrawing Ottoman forces and the advance towards Jerusalem, during which they played a supporting role in actions at Haeira and Sheria and Mughar Ridge, as the Australian Mounted Division advanced towards Summil. For the capture of Jerusalem, the 10th Light Horse Regiment was detached to the British 5th Mounted Brigade to enter the city. A period of rest followed during the winter months, during which a defensive line was occupied before operations recommenced in February 1918. The British Empire troops pushed their line east towards the Jordan River to occupy the western part of the valley, and in late April and early May, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade took part in raid on Es Salt. During the action, the brigade forced a crossing around Damieh and then drove towards Es Salt, where a charge by the 8th Light Horse Regiment secured the town. The brigade held the town until 3 May when they were ordered to withdraw back to the Jordan following setbacks elsewhere. The brigade's return to the western bank was supported by aircraft from No. 3 Squadron AFC. Summer was spent by the Jordan River amidst oppressive heat and vector borne diseases, during which there was a lull in the fighting. During this time, the troopers rotated between occupying the defensive line, resting and training; the brigade received cavalry training during this time, and was instructed in the use of swords, but the weapons were not issued at this time and the troopers used bayonets during this training. In early July, Ottoman and German forces launched an attack on the troops holding the Jordan Valley. The weight of the attack fell against other formations, but in the wake of the Battle of Abu Tellul the 3rd Light Horse Brigade relieved the 1st Light Horse Brigade in the forward areas. 10th Light Horse Regiment lines at Ludd, September 1918 In August, further sword training took place, and the Australian Mounted Division was finally issued with swords in preparation for a renewed offensive, during which they would be employed in a more traditional cavalry role. Meanwhile, the Anzac Mounted Division remained a mounted rifle formation. In September, the British Empire forces launched their attack. The Australian Mounted Division, including the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, launched a cavalry advance along the coast driving towards Damascus, while the Anzac Mounted Division undertook a secondary effort further inland. Commencing 19 September, the brigade took part in a series of actions as part of the wider Battle of Megiddo and Battle of Sharon. On 21 September, the brigade took part in the capture of Jenin, during which they drew swords to rout a large group of Ottoman troops that had been fleeing the battle zone. The brigade then advanced from Nazareth to capture Tiberias, near the Sea of Galilee, where they fought a brief action against withdrawing rearguard forces. Two days later, the brigade attempted to cross the upper Jordan River at Jisr Benat Yakub but found the bridge there had been destroyed; after forcing an alternate crossing another skirmish was fought against rearguard forces. On 29 September, the rearguard held up the advance again around Sasa, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was committed to an attack in the evening, clearing the way for the 4th Light Horse Brigade to roll up part of the withdrawing force, securing a large number of prisoners. In the final advance towards Damascus, the brigade was tasked with interdicting the Damascus ‚Äì Homs road, but was delayed around the Barada Gorge, before entering Damascus and moving through the town to complete their task. They were involved in several minor actions to the north while the remainder of the Australian Mounted Division remained in Damascus. This was the brigade's last major action of the war. The brigade remained around Damascus until late in October when it began the advance towards Homs where the Australian Mounted Division was to replace the 4th Cavalry Division. On 30 October, the Ottomans surrendered, and the Armistice of Mudros came into effect, bringing an end to the fighting in the theatre. Disbandment and perpetuation After the conclusion of hostilities, the Australian Mounted Division undertook occupation duties in Tripoli, near the coast, until it returned to Egypt in early 1919. The brigade's individual regiments were used to quell unrest during the Egyptian revolt; commencing in March. The brigade continued patrols until late June 1919, when the troops were withdrawn from Zagazig back to Moascar for embarkation. The individual regiments embarked for Australia in early July. The horses remained behind due to cost and quarantine issues, and were either destroyed or undertook further service in Egypt or Syria. Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the process of demobilising the AIF continued, although this would not be complete until 1921. At this time, the militia formations that had remained in Australia for home service were reorganised to realign them with the recruitment areas that had contributed to the AIF regiments, and to replicate the AIF's organisational structure and designations. These formations had continued to exist alongside the AIF in Australia, albeit largely on paper only as they had been reduced significantly due to large-scale enlistment in the AIF, and a lack of funds and resources for training. By 1919, a 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been formed in the militia, consisting of the 6th (New South Wales Mounted Rifles), 16th (Hunter River Lancers), and 22nd Light Horse Regiments, which were based Orange, Maitland, and Bathurst, in New South Wales. In the first couple of years after the war, plans were made to reorganise the home forces to meet the needs of peacetime while providing a strong base upon which to mobilise if necessary. By 1921, when the AIF was officially disbanded, plans were approved to raise two cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, utilising a mix of voluntary enlistment and compulsory service. At this time, the brigades were designated as cavalry brigades, rather than light horse brigades, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade ceased to exist. Within the new structure, the 16th Light Horse Regiment became part of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, while the 6th was assigned to the 4th Cavalry Brigade. The 22nd Light Horse was reconstituted in Tasmania as part of the 12th Mixed Brigade with its former personnel being used to raise the 1st and 21st Light Horse Regiments in its former locations.

Most children will outgrow the syndrome (it starts around the age of 3‚Äì13 with a peak around 8‚Äì9 years and stops around age 14‚Äì18), hence the label benign. The seizures, sometimes referred to as sylvian seizures, start around the central sulcus of the brain (also called the centrotemporal area, located around the Rolandic fissure, after Luigi Rolando).Benign Rolandic epilepsy. Retrieved August 8, 2008.  Signs and symptoms  Central sulcus of the brain, superior view. The cardinal features of Rolandic epilepsy are infrequent, often single, focal seizures consisting of: :a. unilateral facial sensorimotor symptoms (30% of patients) :b. oropharyngolaryngeal manifestations (53% of patients) :c. speech arrest (40% of patients), and :d. hypersalivation (30% of patients) Hemifacial sensorimotor seizures are often entirely localised in the lower lip or spread to the ipsilateral hand. Motor manifestations are sudden, continuous or bursts of clonic contractions, usually lasting from a few seconds to a minute. Ipsilateral tonic deviation of the mouth is also common. Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly in the corner of the mouth. Hemifacial seizures are often associated with an inability to speak and hypersalivation: The left side of my mouth felt numb and started jerking and pulling to the left, and I could not speak to say what was happening to me. Negative myoclonus can be observed in some cases, as an interruption of tonic muscular activity Oropharyngolaryngeal ictal manifestations are unilateral sensorimotor symptoms inside the mouth. Numbness, and more commonly paraesthesias (tingling, prickling, freezing), are usually diffuse on one side or, exceptionally, may be highly localised even to one tooth. Motor oropharyngolaryngeal symptoms produce strange sounds, such as death rattle, gargling, grunting and guttural sounds, and combinations: In his sleep, he was making guttural noises, with his mouth pulled to the right, ‚Äòas if he was chewing his tongue‚Äô. We heard her making strange noises ‚Äòlike roaring‚Äô and found her unresponsive, head raised from the pillow, eyes wide open, rivers of saliva coming out of her mouth, rigid. Arrest of speech is a form of anarthria. The child is unable to utter a single intelligible word and attempts to communicate with gestures. My mouth opened and I could not speak. I wanted to say I cannot speak. At the same time, it was as if somebody was strangling me. Hypersalivation, a prominent autonomic manifestation, is often associated with hemifacial seizures, oro-pharyngo-laryngeal symptoms and speech arrest. Hypersalivation is not just frothing: Suddenly my mouth is full of saliva, it runs out like a river and I cannot speak. Syncope-like epileptic seizures may occur, probably as a concurrent symptom of Panayiotopoulos syndrome: She lies there, unconscious with no movements, no convulsions, like a wax work, no life. Consciousness and recollection are fully retained in more than half (58%) of Rolandic seizures. I felt that air was forced into my mouth, I could not speak and I could not close my mouth. I could understand well everything said to me. Other times I feel that there is food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation. I cannot speak. In the remainder (42%), consciousness becomes impaired during the ictal progress and in one third there is no recollection of ictal events. Progression to hemiconvulsions or generalised tonic-clonic seizures occurs in around half of children and hemiconvulsions may be followed by postictal Todd's hemiparesis. Duration and circadian distribution: Rolandic seizures are usually brief, lasting for 1‚Äì3 minutes. Three-quarters of seizures occur during nonrapid eye movement sleep, mainly at sleep onset or just before awakening. Status epilepticus: Although rare, focal motor status or hemiconvulsive status epilepticus is more likely to occur than secondarily generalised convulsive status epilepticus, which is exceptional. Opercular status epilepticus usually occurs in children with atypical evolution or may be induced by carbamazepine or lamotrigine. This state lasts for hours to months and consists of ongoing unilateral or bilateral contractions of the mouth, tongue or eyelids, positive or negative subtle perioral or other myoclonus, dysarthria, speech arrest, difficulties in swallowing, buccofacial apraxia and hypersalivation. These are often associated with continuous spikes and waves on an EEG during NREM sleep. Other seizure types: Despite prominent hypersalivation, focal seizures with primarily autonomic manifestations (autonomic seizures) are not considered part of the core clinical syndrome of Rolandic epilepsy. However, some children may present with independent autonomic seizures or seizures with mixed Rolandic-autonomic manifestations including emesis as in Panayiotopoulos syndrome. Atypical forms: Rolandic epilepsy may present with atypical manifestations such early age at onset, developmental delay or learning difficulties at inclusion, other seizure types, atypical EEG abnormalities. These children usually have normal intelligence and development. Learning can remain unimpaired while a child is afflicted with Rolandic epilepsy.  Cause  Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is thought to be a genetic disorder. An autosomal dominant inheritance with age dependency and variable penetrance has been reported, although not all studies support this theory. Linkage studies have pointed to a possible susceptibility region on chromosome 15q14, in the vicinity of the alpha-7 subunit of the acetylcholine receptor. Most studies show a slight male predominance. Because of the benign course and age-specific occurrence, it is thought to represent a hereditary impairment of brain maturation. An association with ELP4 has been identified.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis can be confirmed when the characteristic centrotemporal spikes are seen on electroencephalography (EEG).Blueprints Neurology, 2nd ed. Typically, high-voltage spikes followed by slow waves are seen. Given the nocturnal activity, a sleep EEG can often be helpful. Technically, the label \\"benign\\" can only be confirmed if the child's development continues to be normal during follow-up. Neuroimaging, usually with an MRI scan, is only advised for cases with atypical presentation or atypical findings on clinical examination or EEG. The disorder should be differentiated from several other conditions, especially centrotemporal spikes without seizures, centrotemporal spikes with local brain pathology, central spikes in Rett syndrome and fragile X syndrome, malignant Rolandic epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy and Landau- Kleffner syndrome.  Treatment  Given the benign nature of the condition and the low seizure frequency, treatment is often unnecessary. If treatment is warranted or preferred by the child and his or her family, antiepileptic drugs can usually control the seizures easily. Carbamazepine is the most frequently used first-line drug, but many other antiepileptic drugs, including valproate, phenytoin, gabapentin, levetiracetam and sultiame have been found effective as well. Bedtime dosing is advised by some. Treatment can be short and drugs can almost certainly be discontinued after two years without seizures and with normal EEG findings, perhaps even earlier. Parental education about Rolandic epilepsy is the cornerstone of correct management. The traumatizing, sometimes long-lasting effect on parents is significant.Valeta T. Parental attitude, reaction and education in benign childhood focal seizures. In: Panayiotopoulos CP, editor. The Epilepsies: Seizures, Syndromes and Management.Oxford: Bladon Medical Publishing; 2005. p. 258-61. It is unclear if there are any benefits to clobazam over other seizure medications.  Prognosis  The prognosis for Rolandic seizures is invariably excellent, with probably less than 2% risk of developing absence seizures and less often GTCS in adult life. Remission usually occurs within 2‚Äì4 years from onset and before the age of 16 years. The total number of seizures is low, the majority of patients having fewer than 10 seizures; 10‚Äì20% have just a single seizure. About 10‚Äì20% may have frequent seizures, but these also remit with age. Children with Rolandic seizures may develop usually mild and reversible linguistic, cognitive and behavioural abnormalities during the active phase of the disease. These may be worse in children with onset of seizures before 8 years of age, high rate of occurrence and multifocal EEG spikes. The development, social adaptation and occupations of adults with a previous history of Rolandic seizures were found normal.  Epidemiology  The age of onset ranges from 1 to 14 years with 75% starting between 7‚Äì10 years. There is a 1.5 male predominance, prevalence is around 15% in children aged 1‚Äì15 years with non-febrile seizures and incidence is 10‚Äì20/100,000 of children aged 0‚Äì15 years  See also  * Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus  References  External links  Category:Channelopathies Category:Epilepsy types ","title":"Rolandic epilepsy"},{"id":"18691313","text":"Edward Stanley Roberts (6 May 1890 - September 1964) was an English first- class cricketer who played three matches for Worcestershire in 1925.

Whitehead at the Office of Telecommunications Policy in Washington, D.C. (early 1970s) Clay T. \\"Tom\\" Whitehead (November 13, 1938 ‚Äì July 23, 2008Hevesi, Dennis, \\"Clay T. Whitehead, Guide of Policy That Helped Cable TV, Is Dead at 69\\", The New York Times, July 31, 2008) was a United States government official who served as Special Assistant to the President from 1968-1970; Director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) from 1970 to 1974 during the Nixon administration; Director of the Ford Transition Team immediately before Nixon's resignation; and an operative in the White House during the initial phases of the Ford transition. Whitehead pioneered a policy of competition across the telecommunications industries, which later was reflected in legislation and regulations in the United States and around the world.Wu. Tim, The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires, New York: Knopf, 2010, (, ). Cf. pp.187-197, p.177, & various.  Early life  Whitehead was born in Neodesha, Kansas, the eldest of four children of Clay B. and Helen Hinton Whitehead. As a young boy, he was interested in telecommunications, spending hours on his ham radio talking to amateur radio operators around the world. He practiced photography with a darkroom of his own design and built his own celestial telescope for studying space.  Education and early career  He graduated from Cherokee County High School in Columbus, Cherokee County, Kansas 1957. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning his undergraduate and master's degrees in electrical engineering, in 1961 respectively, and a Ph.D. in management in 1967. In addition, Whitehead engaged in extensive studies in economics, which almost qualified him to write a dissertation in the field, but instead decided finally to leave MIT. From 1958 to 1960 he worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, between 1958 and 1960 under the MIT cooperative program developing experimental design of pulse and analog electronic equipment. Before joining the Nixon campaign in 1968 as an expert on budget policies, Whitehead was a RAND Corporation economist and defense analyst.  The White House Years  Between 1969 and 1970, Whitehead served as Special Assistant to President Richard Nixon. In this capacity, he crafted the ‚ÄúOpen Skies‚Äù domestic satellite policy that allowed any qualified private company to launch communications satellites, thereby deregulating the monopoly model for the technology. The policy enabled cable television networks including C-SPAN, CNN, and HBO to prosper and created a ripple effect that ultimately led to sweeping and lasting changes in the telecommunications landscape. In 1970, Whitehead led the effort to create the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP), which he announced at a White House Press conference on January 23, 1970. Having tried to recruit heads for the new office, and finding none that fit the description he had in mind, he took the job himself and was confirmed by the U. S. Senate in 1970. Brian Lamb was Director for Congressional and Media Relations, resigning in 1974, and Antonin Scalia was the General Counsel for OTP at that time. Inspired by the OTP mantra of \\"manyvoices,\\" Lamb founded C-SPAN in 1979. Scalia resigned in 1972 to become Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, before becoming an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1986. One of OTP‚Äôs accomplishments included ending the regulatory freeze on the infant cable industry, which then permitted it to compete with television broadcasting and, eventually, the established telephone industry. Whitehead‚Äôs policies also impacted broadcasting directly. ‚ÄúHe was credited with formulating policies that gave more autonomy to local stations in the public broadcasting system, which was seen by some PBS executives as an attack on the service in large part because of Dr. Whitehead's early reputation for antagonizing the press.‚Äù In a noted 1972 speech, Whitehead used the terms \\"elitist gossip\\" and \\"ideological plugola\\" to echo the Nixon administration's claims of liberal bias in network news. Walter Cronkite claims in his memoir that Whitehead suggested to affiliate stations that they need not carry network news reports such as Cronkite's, and instead could rely on wire dispatches.A Reporter's Life, Walter Cronkite, p. 223 In the spring of 1974, while still working for Nixon and at the encouragement of Gerald Ford's former law partner, Philip Buchen, later Counsel to President Ford, Whitehead secretly organized and led the effort, including Jonathan Moore, assistant to Attorney General Elliot Richardson; Brian Lamb, by then a broadcast journalist; and Laurence Lynn, Jr., Assistant Secretary for Policy, Health Education and Welfare, to plan Vice President Ford's transition to the Presidency.The other men were Philip Buchen, Brian Lamb, Lawrence Lynn, and Johnathan Moore.

(2001) 69 NSWLR 558 was an Australian court case decided in the New South Wales Court of Appeal on 21 June 2001, concerning a dispute between United States-based fast food chain Burger King, and its Australian franchisee Hungry Jack's. It related to the breach of a business development agreement between the two companies, and the resulting attempts of Burger King to terminate the contract. The Court of Appeal decided that Burger King could not terminate the contract, for several reasons, one of which was that it was in breach of an implied term of good faith, having taken steps to engineer the breach of the contract. The case is significant in Australian contract law as one of the most expansive characterisations yet of an implied term of good faith, particularly as it operates to limit parties exercising their contractual rights. Background to the case Hungry Jack's became the Australian franchisee of Burger King in 1971, and by 1996 it was the largest franchisee outside the United States, operating 150 restaurants directly and a further 18 through third-party franchisees. From the 1980s onwards, Burger King had increased its interest in the operations of Hungry Jack's, leading to a number of disputes which prompted alterations to the franchise agreements in 1986, 1989, and again late in 1990 with the completion of four new agreements relating to different aspects of Hungry Jack's activities. One of these four agreements was the Development Agreement, clause 2.1 of which required Hungry Jack's to open four new stores each year in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland either directly or through third-party franchisees. Additionally, clause 4.1 made the opening of any new restaurants subject to Burger King's operational and financial approval. Several more disputes arose between the parties in the early 1990s, revolving around Burger King's desire to enter the Australian market directly. In 1992 Burger King considered buying out Hungry Jack's and its stores, either itself, through a third party or through a joint venture, but Hungry Jack's rejected these proposals. In 1993 Burger King commenced negotiations with Shell to open Burger King outlets in some of Shell's service stations ‚Äî initially including but later excluding Hungry Jack's from the discussions ‚Äî which culminated in the opening of seven outlets from 1995. During this time a senior Hungry Jack's executive was leaking secret information to Burger King about Hungry Jack's internal operations, and advising Burger King of methods it might employ to force Hungry Jack's to sell out its business to Burger King. The disputes came to a head in 1995, when Burger King withdrew all approval for third-party franchisees, and stopped granting financial or operating approval to proposed new stores, which meant that Hungry Jack's was unable to open four restaurants per year, as required by clause 2.1 of the Development Agreement. Furthermore, in 1996, a number of stores' franchise agreements expired, and while Burger King renegotiated the agreements, the new agreements made future renewals subject to Burger King's approval, rather than providing for a right to renew; following this, Burger King announced that it would not renew any of these store franchises once they expired. In November 1996, Burger King purported to terminate the agreement between itself and Hungry Jack's, on the basis that Hungry Jack's had not opened the required number of stores. Hungry Jack's then sued Burger King, alleging that Burger King had no right to terminate the agreement, and also challenging the validity of the new extension agreements. Hungry Jack's was successful at trial, the trial judge finding that there had been breaches of contract and breaches of fiduciary duty on Burger King's part, and awarding Hungry Jack's nearly $AU 71 million in damages. Burger King appealed against the decision. Arguments=Clause 2.1 Hungry Jack's argued that its failure to comply with clause 2.1 did not give Burger King a right to terminate the agreement. Clause 8.1 of the agreement provided that the franchise fees normally payable by Hungry Jack's would be waived if the development schedule were complied with (that is, if Hungry Jack's opened the required number of stores), and further provided that, even if Hungry Jack's failed to comply, it would have a 12-month grace period to remedy the failure and still avoid the franchise fees. Hungry Jack's argued that this meant Burger King would not have a right to terminate until the grace period expired, or else it would lose its opportunity to remedy the failure to comply. Burger King argued that clause 15.1(d) ‚Äî which allowed it to terminate the agreement if any of the conditions were breached ‚Äî was worded broadly enough that any breach would activate it, and that clause 8.1 only operated if it chose not to terminate the agreement. Burger King alternatively argued that even if it had no right to terminate under clause 15.1(d), it had a right to terminate for a breach of clause 2.1 on ordinary principles of contract law, because clause 2.1 was an essential term of the contract. It argued that terms in commercial contracts setting out the time for performance are usually considered essential terms. Good faith Hungry Jack's also argued that the Development Agreement included an implied term of good faith (that is, that the parties must act in good faith when exercising their rights under the contract), and that Burger King had breached this term by denying the financial and operating approval to new restaurants, leading to Hungry Jack's failing to meet the minimum stores requirement. As a result of this breach of good faith, it argued, Burger King could not successfully terminate the contract. Judgment The Court of Appeal delivered a unanimous judgment, dismissing the appeal. They found that Burger King had no right to terminate the contract, whether under clause 15.1(d) of the agreement, or under general principles of contract law, and further found that Burger King had breached an implied term of good faith. Clause 2.1 The court first considered clause 2.1 in the Development Agreement. They noted that, while on its face it seemed to create in Burger King a right to terminate in the event of non-compliance by Hungry Jack's, it was actually subject to a number of qualifications, and that there were other procedures within the agreement for dealing with situations of non-compliance. The court disagreed with Burger King's broad reading of the consequences of a breach of clause 2.1, concluding that such an interpretation would mean that Hungry Jack's could not take advantage of the grace period, and that a narrower view should be preferred. Accordingly, they found that since Burger King had not allowed the 12-month grace period to expire, its termination was not effective. The court then considered whether clause 2.1 was an essential term, breach of which would allow Burger King to terminate the contract on the basis of ordinary principles of contract law. It considered a number of other clauses which provided for various procedures if clause 2.1 were not complied with (including the grace period in clause 8.1), and held that clause 2.1 could not be considered an essential term, as it could not be said that Burger King would not have entered the contract without being assured of strict compliance with it. The court thus found that Burger King had no right to terminate the contract for Hungry Jack's breach of 2.1, either under the contract or under the common law. Good faith In considering whether an implied term of good faith (along with an implied term of reasonableness) was included in the contract, the court first discussed past New South Wales cases on the point, in which terms of good faith had been implied into the relevant contracts, particularly Renard Constructions v Minister for Public Works. In that case, Priestley JA had considered the status of implied terms of good faith in United States contract law ‚Äî particularly via an examination of the Second Restatement of Contracts ‚Äî where requirements of good faith are not only well-entrenched but often incorporated into contracts by way of legislation. The court also examined the recognition of good faith in other Australian jurisdictions. The court found that a requirement of good faith may well be implied in all commercial contracts, particularly in standard form contracts. However, it also considered that the contract in this case did not fall into any of the traditional categories of contracts where such terms are often implied. The court held that in these circumstances, it is necessary to consider whether the requirement of good faith is both reasonable and necessary in determining whether it should be implied into the contract. In this case, the court said that the term was reasonable and necessary, since otherwise Burger King would be able to deny approval for new stores \\"capriciously, or with the sole intent of engineering a default of the Development Agreement\\". In terms of the meaning of good faith, the court considered that there was no \\"distinction of substance\\" between an obligation to act in good faith and an obligation to act reasonably. It further said that, while parties to a contract are allowed to pursue their own legitimate commercial interests within the framework of a contract, to do so for a purpose extraneous to the contract would be a breach of good faith. The court held that Burger King's actions in denying financial and operating approval for new restaurants were not the legitimate pursuit of interests under the Development Agreement, but were rather efforts to harm or hinder Hungry Jack's. Consequences Burger King subsequently sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia, which was granted.. However, the appeal was subsequently dismissed by agreement between the parties.. The case has been recognised as one among several cases indicating that \\"[a] duty of good faith in the performance of contracts is on the agenda of Australian contract law\\". Horrigan identified the case as one of a number of cases in which New South Wales courts were leading the way in terms of good faith in Australian contract law, while noting that the idea has yet to catch on extensively in other jurisdictions, identifying good faith as one of the important unresolved areas of \\"fairness-based business regulation\\". To the extent that the decision represents a trend towards treating good faith as an implied term in many contracts, or possibly even a universal term, it has been criticised in a number of ways. Adrian Baron has argued that the implication of a term of good faith runs contrary to basic principles of contract law, because it tends to disregard the reality that (at least in commercial contexts) parties to a contract \\"pursue their own commercial interests, and enter into terms that reflect the risks and benefits that each party is prepared to bear\\". Baron argued that in 1990, when the parties entered the Development Agreement, \\"it would have been plain to Hungry Jack's that if certain events occurred, Burger King could, at its option, terminate the agreement\\", and that the contract sufficiently identified the circumstances warranting termination of the contract, with the result that \\"[t]he appendage of a requirement of reasonableness and good faith by the court to the agreement was inconsistent with the bargain freely entered into by the parties.\\" Carter and Peden have argued that the case, along with Renard Constructions,Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works (1992) 26 NSWLR 234. introduced a number of \\"unexplained anomalies in the law of termination clauses\\", including creating inconsistencies with other precedents relating to powers of sale and equitable limitations on challenging the termination of sale of land contracts. Carter and Peden further argued that an implied good faith term is unnecessary, because basic contract principles already account for it, and it can only serve to introduce inconsistencies, stating that \\"[i]t seems clear that there are some who see Australian contract law as the 'poor relation' in comparison with other jurisdictions when it comes to good faith\\" and that \\"[a] term of good faith is then implied almost by way of apology to the parties.\\" This case was one of a number of cases relied on in argument before the High Court of Australia in the case of Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council,. however the court dealt with the dispute without needing to consider the issue,. \\"technically reserv[ing] for another day [their] conclusive response\\" to the question of implied terms of good faith. , the case has yet to be considered in any other High Court cases.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on January 18, 1947. The title is a takeoff on the popular song \\"One Meat Ball\\". Plot In a forest dwells Grover Groundhog and today is Groundhog Day. Grover Groundhog does a dance with his shadow saying that his shadow means nothing in relation to the weather forecast. A radio broadcast prompts Grover to leave his burrow for photographers to see if his shadow appears or not. Upon leaving his burrow the cameras switch to guns (revealing the pretend photographers are hunters) and begin firing at Grover, but he manages to retreat. Porky and his dog Mandrake are hunting for a groundhog as well. Mandrake's first searching attempt only has him retrieve a boot. While Mandrake lingers in the woods, Grover gives him a fright. Mandrake recognises Grover as a groundhog and begins chasing him (even after Grover bribes him). Grover starts scolding Mandrake and making a sad story. This makes Mandrake oppose Porky's hunting, until Porky snaps him out of it. Before resuming the chase, Porky's dons a pair of earmuffs on Mandrake, but Grover tells another sad story through a microphone into the earmuffs. As Porky scolds Mandrake, the dog pretends to commit suicide with a water pistol. Porky gives Mandrake a final chance to catch the groundhog. Grover tricks Mandrake into eating a bone so that Porky thinks he ate the groundhog. As Porky confronts Mandrake, Grover whispers a sad story to pass on to Mandrake. Mandrake snaps Porky out of his tears and Grover runs off. All three of them rush into Grover's home and their fighting is actually shown to be shadow boxing, with Porky explaining, \\"This way, no one gets hurt!\\" Availability * VHS - Viddy-Oh!

In appearance igniter cord is similar to safety fuse and when ignited, an intense flame spits perpendicular to the cord at a uniform rate as it burns along its length. Igniter cord in construction is again similar to safety fuse, consisting of a pyrotechnic composition at the core, wrapped with a nylon sheath to provide shape and finally wrapped again in an outer plastic shell to provide water resistance. Normally, igniter cord also consists of a metal wire at the very center of the pyrotechnic core which also runs the entire length of the cord; the pyrotechnic composition will react with the metal wire (typically aluminum, iron or copper) to increase the energetics of the fuse. There are two types of PICs: the fast type which has nominal burning speed of 30 cm per second, a diameter of about 3 mm, and is brownish in color; and the slow type, which has a diameter of 2 mm, is greenish in color, and has a nominal burning speed of 3 cm per second.

It participated in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok-Minsk, Battle of Brody, Battle of Kiev and Battle of Smolensk. It supported the push to capture Moscow, which resulted in the failed Battle of Moscow. It was withdrawn to Germany to rest in December 1941‚Äì January 1942. KG 53 supported Fall Blau and the German Sixth Army at the Battle of Stalingrad, and took part in the desperate resupply operation after the Russian counteroffensive had encircled the Sixth Army. Attacks were also carried out in northern Russia, against Leningrad. Strategic bombing attacks were also conducted against Gorki in June 1943, aimed at the Tank factory at Gorkovskiy Avtomobilniy. All of GAZ No. 1 plants 50 buildings, 9,000 metres of conveyors, 5,900 units of equipment and 8,000 tank engines were destroyed or damaged.Bergstr√∂m 2007 p. 20.

Naukane (c. 1779 ‚Äì February 2, 1850), also known as John Coxe, Edward Cox, and Coxe was a Native Hawaiian chief who traveled widely through North America in the early 19th century. He was either considered a member of the royal household of Kamehameha I or a chiefly retainer, possibly the same person as Noukana, the son of High Chief Kamanawa, the King's uncle and trusted advisor. Life In 1811 the Tonquin, belonging to the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC), stopped on Oahu and recruited twenty Hawaiians to work as labourers (known as kanakas) in the Pacific Northwest. King Kamehameha I appointed Naukane to join the group and look after the interests of Hawaiian laborers. On the voyage to Fort Astoria on the Columbia River Naukane was given the name John Coxe, because he resembled a shipmate on the Tonquin. online at Google Books Soon after Naukane arrived at Fort Astoria, David Thompson of the Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) also arrived. In July, 1811, Thompson and a group of Astorians began to journey up the Columbia River. The two parties traveled together until they reached the Columbia Gorge, after which Thompson went on ahead. Before parting ways there was an exchange of some of the workers. Thompson allowed his employee Michel Boulard to join the Pacific Fur Company in exchange for Naukane, who Thompson referred to as Coxe. Boulard was a 40-year-old voyageur who had worked with Thompson off and on for the previous eleven years. Boulard, although weaker with age, was useful to the Astorians for his great knowledge of geography and native affairs. In contrast, Naukane was valuable to Thompson for his great strength. Naukane traveled with Thompson as far as Spokane House. There he was left with Jaco Finlay while Thompson continued rapidly on. Soon Naukane was traveling east as well, crossing the continent to Fort William (today's Thunder Bay, Ontario) on Lake Superior.Asian North American History Timeline Project , explorASIAN From there he traveled by water to Quebec. In 1812 the ship took him to England. In 1813 he returned to the Pacific Northwest on After the demise of the Pacific Fur Company during the War of 1812, Naukane returned to the Hawaiian Islands in 1815. He soon returned to the Pacific Northwest as an employee of the North West Company. He worked as a labourer at Fort George (the name of Fort Astoria under the NWC). When the company was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1821, Naukane remained at Fort George as an HBC employee. In 1823 he was sent with King Kamehameha II to England to visit King George IV. He spent most of the rest of his life near Fort Vancouver, working for the HBC. He had a wife in 1825 and appears to have had a Native slave, Marie, whom he likely inherited through a previous Native wife. He appears to have retired in 1843 or 1844 and probably continued to live in Kanaka Village at Fort Vancouver. He died on February 2, 1850, at Fort Vancouver.

Global Justice  Supporter of the individual responsibility of the rulers in the case of international crimes, Archibugi has also actively supported, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the creation of an International Criminal Court, collaborating both with the jurists of the UN International Law Commission and with the Italian Government.see Daniele Archibugi and Alice Pease, Crime and Global Justice: The Dynamics of International Punishment, Polity, 2018.

The brigade was initially formed as a part-time militia formation in the early 1900s in Victoria and Tasmania. After the outbreak of World War I, the brigade was raised as a volunteer formation within the AIF in March 1915 and shipped to Egypt and was broken up in August 1915 to provide dismounted reinforcements to other light horse formations already deployed to Gallipoli. Reformed in February 1917, the brigade was assigned to the Imperial Mounted Division, which formed part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, and in June 1917 transferred to the Australian Mounted Division, where it served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign until the end of the war. After the war, the AIF light horse regiments were demobilised and disbanded; however, the brigade briefly existed as a part-time militia formation in New South Wales until 1921 when its regiments were reorganised into cavalry brigades. History=Early formation The 4th Light Horse Brigade was initially raised as part of the militia in the early 1900s, being formed around 1902. That formation had been raised in Victoria and Tasmania, and had consisted of the 10th, 11th and 12th Australian Light Horse Regiments. In 1910, the brigade was reorganised when the 12th was replaced by the 19th Australian Light Horse, which was based in regional Victoria. By 1912, however, the brigade had ceased to exist and the consistent regiments reorganised and dispersed to other formations. The 10th Australian Light Horse became the 13th Light Horse Regiment and was assigned to the 5th Light Horse Brigade, the 19th was reorganised into the 17th Light Horse Regiment and assigned to the 7th Light Horse Brigade, while the 11th Australian Light Horse was split to become the 20th and 29th Light Horse Regiments. The 20th was also assigned to the 7th Light Horse Brigade, while the 29th became the divisional cavalry regiment. At this time, plans were made to re-raise the 4th Light Horse Brigade with the 8th, 10th and 12th Light Horse Regiments, but this did not occur before the war broke out. World War I alt=A large formation of soldiers riding horses pass a shallow dam At the outbreak of the war August 1914 the Australian Government decided to raise the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) consisting of 20,000 troops comprising an infantry division and a light horse brigade of three regiments to be used at the discretion of Britain. These regiments were raised from volunteers for overseas service, as the provisions of the Defence Act did not allow conscripts to be deployed overseas. Nevertheless, many of the recruits were drawn from the various militia light horse formations created as a consequence of the Kitchener Report 1910 and the introduction of Universal Training, although they were assigned to freshly raised units that were separate to the light horse regiments raised as part of the militia. Initial enlistments outstripped expectations and as a result, a total of three light horse brigades as well as two divisional cavalry regiments were formed. One of the regiments assigned as divisional cavalry was the 4th Light Horse Regiment, raised in October 1914, which would eventually form part the 4th Light Horse Brigade, although it was not initially assigned to the brigade when it was formed in early 1915. The AIF 4th Light Horse Brigade came into being in mid-1915, being raised in Australia. Upon establishment, the brigade consisted of the 11th, 12th and 13th Light Horse Regiments, which were raised in March and May 1915. The 11th was drawn from both Queensland and South Australia, while the 12th came predominately from New South Wales, and the 13th was from Victoria. The Aboriginal cavalrymen among them were dubbed the ‚ÄúQueensland Black Watch\\" by the Australians. =Aden, Egypt and Gallipoli= Under the command of Colonel Reginald Spencer Browne, the brigade embarked for the Middle East between May and June 1915. While en route to Egypt, they were diverted to provide some troops to support the British garrison in Aden, where an Ottoman attack was expected. Brief patrol operations were undertaken, but the attack did not develop and the brigade continued on to Egypt, arriving in July. In Egypt, the brigade undertook further training at Heliopolis Camp. Subsequent embarkations of reinforcements occurred as and when sufficient recruits were gathered and prepared for movement to a war theatre. Meanwhile, the fighting at Gallipoli had seen the deployment of the first three light horse brigades to reinforce the infantry that had landed in April. In July, the decision was made to break up the 4th Light Horse Brigade, and to deploy its regiments as dismounted reinforcements. The 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments arrived in late August, while the 13th arrived in mid-September. From this time, the three regiments were broken up and provided individual squadrons to the other light horse regiments from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades that were holding the line, having been sent to Gallipoli in May. They subsequently undertook mainly defensive duties in the final stages of the campaign, prior to their withdrawal in late December 1915. =Sinai and Palestine campaign= After returning to Egypt from the Gallipoli campaign the 4th, 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments remained unbrigaded until the War Office agreed to reform the 4th Light Horse Brigade in January 1917. The brigade would join the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades to form the Imperial Mounted Division (later known as the Australian Mounted Division), which formed part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. The previously assigned 13th Light Horse Regiment had been deployed to the Western Front in 1916, providing a squadron as divisional cavalry to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions. The brigade's artillery support was provided by the British who assigned A Battery, Honourable Artillery Company from XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). Photograph claimed to be of the charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba, although it may be a re-enactment taken in February 1918. After being re-raised, the brigade took part in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. Its first major action of this campaign came during the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917. The Ottoman position was located about inland from the coast, around the edge of the dunes. It was strongly defended and despite efforts to reinforce the attack with tanks and gas, the direct attack proved costly and unsuccessful. The brigade's casualties in this battle amounted to 200 men killed or wounded. After this, British planners decided to attempt an indirect approach, focusing their efforts on Beersheba, about from Gaza. It was here that the 4th Light Horse Brigade fought its most notable action of the war during the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917. During the initial part of the battle, the brigade had been dispersed and barely involved; however, later in the day two of the brigade's regiments ‚Äì the 4th and 12th ‚Äì were committed to a charge over open ground, which ultimately breached the Ottoman defences and secured the town's water supply before the wells could be destroyed by the defending troops. The breakthrough at Beersheba paved the way for the opening of the Southern Palestine Offensive, and on 7 November, the 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments took part in an attack on Sheria; Ottoman fire proved heavy and the troopers were forced to dismount before the attack was turned back. After Gaza was captured, the brigade took part in the pursuit of the withdrawing Ottoman forces, before the 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments repelled an Ottoman counterattack in mid-November. Following the capture of Jerusalem, the brigade wintered in Judea, and then moved to Belah, on the coast near Gaza, for rest and training over the course of several months. In late April 1918, the brigade was deployed into the Jordan Valley and between 29 April and 4 May took part in the raid on Es Salt. Defensive positions were occupied on the western bank of the Jordan River throughout June and July, before the brigade left the Jordan Valley in mid-August. Around this time, the troopers were issued swords and received cavalry training, in preparation for a renewed offensive aimed at capturing Damascus. In mid-September, the brigade took part in the advance towards Semakh and Tiberias and on 25 September the brigade took part in the Battle of Samakh ‚Äì a minor action that formed part of the Battle of Sharon and the wider Battle of Megiddo ‚Äì where the 11th Light Horse carried out a mounted charge with drawn swords before dismounting and clearing the town with rifles and bayonets. The 4th and 12th Light Horse were heavily engaged on 30 September, carrying out a charge at Kaukab. The next day, elements of the 4th Light Horse Regiment carried out a patrol to Damascus, while the 12th also entered the town on 2 October. The brigade remained in Damascus for most of October, before joining the final stage of the campaign which saw the brigade begin the advance towards Homs on 27 October. The advance was short lived, as on 30 October the Ottomans surrendered, and the Armistice of Mudros came into effect, bringing an end to the fighting in the theatre. Disbandment and perpetuation In November 1918, the brigade was moved to Tripoli, in preparation for a later move to Egypt as part of the demobilisation process. Throughout early 1919, the brigade was occupied with recreational pursuits and educational classes, while the process of returning equipment and mounts began. In late March 1919, elements of the brigade were used to suppress the Egyptian revolt, undertaking patrols and carrying out internal security duties into May. Afterwards, the individual regiments embarked for Australia between June and July 1919, and after which they were disbanded. Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the process of demobilising the AIF took place, although this would not be complete until 1921. At this time, the militia formations that had remained in Australia for home service were reorganised to realign them with the recruitment areas that had contributed to the AIF regiments, and to replicate the AIF's organisational structure and designations. These formations had continued to exist alongside the AIF, albeit largely on paper only as they had been reduced significantly due to large-scale enlistment in the AIF, and a lack of funds and resources for training. By 1919, a 4th Light Horse Brigade had been formed in the militia, consisting of the 1st, 7th and 24th Light Horse Regiments, which were based in Parramatta, Goulburn and Wagga Wagga, in New South Wales. In the first couple of years after the war, plans were made to reorganise the home forces to meet the needs of peacetime while providing a strong base upon which to mobilise if necessary. By 1921, when the AIF was officially disbanded, plans were approved to reorganise the militia to raise two cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, utilising a mix of voluntary enlistment and compulsory service. At this time, the brigades were designated as cavalry brigades, rather than light horse brigades, and the 4th Light Horse Brigade ceased to exist. Within the new structure, the 1st and 7th Light Horse Regiments became part of the 4th Cavalry Brigade, based in New South Wales, while the 24th Light Horse was eventually amalgamated with the 12th and was assigned to the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, also based in New South Wales. The Victorian light horse regiments were organised into the 3rd and 5th Cavalry Brigades at this time.

In a very short time, J√°m Unar was sufficiently strong enough to attack Sehw√°n. Ratan, a Hindu, was at that time the governor of the region, on behalf of the king of Dehl√≠. He came out to meet J√°m Unar and defeated him in a battle, but the next day J√°m Unar returned to fight with redoubled force. He defeated Ratan, who accidentally fell from his horse and into the hands of his enemy, who cut off his head with a blow. The fort of Sehw√°n was then soon taken. Upon returning to his capital, J√°m Unar began to lead a luxurious life. One day while he was drunk, information was received of some rising at a short distance. The J√°m deputed his agent K√°hah son of Tam√°ch√≠ to put down the rebellion. As K√°hah himself was in an intoxicated state, he was soon taken prisoner by the mob.

He played for the Wexford senior hurling team for 16 years, during which time he usually lined out at midfield but was also deployed at full-forward. A master of the overhead stroke, his blonde hair and long, sweeping strides made him a cult hero of Wexford hurling. Wheeler began his hurling career at club level with St. Martin's. He was just 16-year-old when he enjoyed his first success when the club won the 1948 Wexford Junior Championship title. He later captained the club to the Wexford Minor Championship in 1950. Wheeler later transferred to the Faythe Harriers club, with whom he won Wexford Senior Championship medals in 1960, 1962 and 1965. At inter-county level, Wheeler joined the Wexford senior team as a 17-year-old in 1949. From his debut, he was ever-present either at half-back, midfield or full-forward and made numerous National League and Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 1965. During that time Wheeler was part of three All-Ireland Championship- winning teams ‚Äì in 1955, 1956 and 1960.

Sand's grave is in a small enclosed cemetery between the church and the garden. The House of George Sand is a writer's house museum in the village of Nohant, in the Indre department of France. It was the home of George Sand (born as Aurore Dupin; 1804-1876), a French author, and was purchased by the French state in 1952. The house was preserved because it was where Sand wrote many of her books and hosted some of the most important artists and writers of her time, including Chopin, Liszt, Balzac, Turgenev, and Delacroix. The writer and her family are buried in a small cemetery between the garden and the village church. The gardens are classified by the French Ministry of Culture as among the Notable Gardens of France. The house is open to the public and is managed by the Centre des monuments nationaux.  History  The village of 'Nohan' was mentioned in French chronicles as early as 1228. A fortified manor house stood on the site and was reconstructed between 1450 and 1452. Two of the original towers are part of the farm of the present chateau.La Maison de George Sand a Nohant, Anne-Marie de Brem, Editions du Patrimoine, Centre des Monuments Nationaux In 1767, the land and house were purchased by Pierre Pearron, who reconstructed the manor in its present form. It was sold in 1793, during the French Revolution, to Madame Dupin de Francueil, the illegitimate daughter of the French military hero Maurice de Saxe. She was the granddaughter of the King of Poland, August II the Strong, and grandmother of George Sand, who laid out the gardens and built the main stairway. In 1808, Aurore Dupin (the future George Sand), then just four years old, came to live with her grandmother after the accidental death of her father, Maurice Dupin, an officer in the French army. Aurore's grandmother was not happy with what she considered the excessive exuberance and free ways of the child, and she subsequently sent Aurore to a convent. When Aurore was 16, her grandmother was paralyzed by a stroke, and Aurore returned to Nohant to take care of her. When her grandmother died in 1821, Aurore received the house as an inheritance. The following year, she married Casimir Dudevant, who was nine years her senior. They had two children, Maurice (1823‚Äì1889) and Solange (1828‚Äì1899). To mark the births of the children, Aurore planted two cedar trees in front of the house, which are still there. In 1830, Aurore fell in love with Jules Sandeau,She wrote her first book in collaboration with Sandeau, and took her famous pseudonym from his last name and she left her husband to move to Paris. There she wrote two novels, Indiana and L√©lia, under the name \\"George Sand\\", which made her famous. In her absence, her husband took possession of the house. She regained it after a lawsuit and moved back into the house in 1837. From 1837 until her death in 1876, she spent long summers at the house, usually from May until November, where she entertained many of the most famous artists of the time, including composer Franz Liszt, writers Honor√© de Balzac and Gustave Flaubert, and painter Eug√®ne Delacroix. From 1839 until 1847, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin lived with her in the house, completing his second piano sonata, and writing the Fantaisie in F minor, the two Nocturnes, Op. 37, and the four Mazurkas, Op. 41\\\\. The panels Sand installed to muffle the sound of Chopin's piano can still be seen. Many of her most famous novels, including Consuelo, La Mare au Diable, and Le Meunier d'Angibault, were written in the house, and most of her novels are set in the Berry countryside and villages around Nohant.See Anne-Marie de Brem, La Maison de George Sand at Nohant After her death in 1876, the home passed to her son, Maurice. The house remained in the family until the death of Maurice's eldest daughter, Aurore (1866-1961). It was classified as a National Historical Monument of France in 1952, and it was opened to the public in 1961 as the Maison de George Sand √† Nohant.

Born in Wickmore, County Wexford, Jacob was introduced to hurling in his youth. His granduncle, Jim Mythen, was an All-Ireland medal winner with Wexford in 1910. Jacob quickly established himself on the Oulart-the Ballagh junior team. A championship medal winner in the junior and intermediate grades, he lost several senior championship finals. Jacob made his debut on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Wexford minor team. After little success in this grade, he later won an All-Ireland medal with the under-21 team. Jacob joined the senior team during the 1966 championship. He went on to play a key role for Wexford in attack during a successful era, and won one All-Ireland medal, one Leinster medal and one National Hurling League medal. Throughout his inter-county career Jacob made 11 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1973 championship. Jacob's siblings- Mick, Robbie and Bridie - also played with distinction at all levels with Wexford. His nieces and nephews - Helena, Ursula, Michael and Rory - have also lined out with Wexford. Playing career=Club Jacob began his club career with the Oulart-the Ballagh junior team. He won a junior championship medal in 1967 before claiming an intermediate championship medal in 1968. Inter-county Jacob first came to prominence on the inaugural Wexford under-21 team. He won his first Leinster medal in 1964 as Laois were defeated by 4-7 to 2-2. On 4 October 1964 Wexford faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. A tally of 2-2 for Michael \\"Babs\\" Keating helped Tipperary to an easy 8-9 to 3-1 victory. Wexford retained the provincial under-21 title in 1965 with Jacob winning a second Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year with Tipperary providing the opposition once again. A 3-7 to 1-4 victory gave Jacob an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. Jacob made his senior championship debut in a 3-18 to 4-5 Leinster semi-final defeat of Dublin on 19 June 1966. After establishing himself on the starting fifteen, Jacob claimed his first national title in 1967 when a 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Kilkenny gave him a National Hurling League medal. Jacob won his sole Leinster medal in the senior grade in 1968 following a 3-13 to 4-9 defeat of reigning provincial and All-Ireland champions Kilkenny. This victory allowed Wexford to advance to an All-Ireland final against Tipperary, the outstanding team of the decade, on 1 September 1968. All was going to plan for Tipperary as they took a 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì3 lead at half-time. In one of the great All-Ireland comebacks, Tony Doran got Wexford back on track with a goal six minutes after the interval. Three more goals followed from Paul Lynch, Jack Berry and Doran again. Late goals from \\"Babs\\" Keating and Se√°n McLoughlin for Tipperary failed to stem the tide as Wexford secured a remarkable 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì12 victory. The victory gave Jacob his sole All-Ireland medal. Over the next few years Jacob found it difficult to maintain his position on the Wexford team. After being dropped completely in 1970, he played in the Leinster finals of 1971 and 1973; however, Kilkenny won were victorious on both occasions. Jacob retired from inter-county hurling shortly after the 1973 defeat.

Roman legions arrived around 71, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \\"Britain\\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \\"Albion\\", Romans under Q. Petilius Cerialis and Gn. Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s AD. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \\"Mons Graupius\\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held Scottish land for about 80 years, if at all. Some Scottish historians such as Alistair Moffat maintain Roman influence was inconsequential. \\"Scots\\" and \\"Scotland\\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the End of Roman rule in Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as, or fallen under the control of, the Picts, while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti (Gaelic Irish raiders) who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. The dawn of Scottish history An early Greek map from Ptolemy's description of the British Isles (), showing his rotation of Scotland to the right. Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \\"very large\\" islands called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).Breeze, David J. \\"The ancient geography of Scotland\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 10‚Äì13. The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \\"King of Orkney\\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in 43 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.Moffat (2005) pp. 173-74.Thomson (2008) pp. 4‚Äì5 suggests that there may have been an element of Roman \\"boasting\\" involved, given that it was known to them that the Orcades lay at the northern extremity of the British Isles. The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.Moffat (2005) pp. 174-76. Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.Moffat (2005) p. 230.Breeze, David J. \\"The ancient geography of Scotland\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 11. Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his De Chorographia, written around 43, that there were 30 Orkney islands and seven Haemodae (possibly Shetland).Breeze, David J. \\"The ancient geography of Scotland\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 12. There is certainly evidence of an Orcadian connection with Rome prior to 60 from pottery found at the Broch of Gurness.Moffat (2005) pp. 173‚Äì74. By the time of Pliny the Elder ( 79), Roman knowledge of the geography of Scotland had extended to the Hebudes (The Hebrides), Dumna (probably the Outer Hebrides), the Caledonian Forest, and the Caledonians. Ptolemy, possibly drawing on earlier sources of information as well as more contemporary accounts from the Agricolan invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland in his Geography, but many of the names are obscure. His information becomes much less reliable in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these area was confined to observations from the sea.Moffat (2005) pp. 236‚Äì37. Famously, his co√∂rdinates place most of Scotland north of Hadrian's Wall bent at a right angle, stretching due eastward from the rest of Britain. The Broch of Gurness in Orkney Iron Age culture in Scotland Glenelg Ptolemy's tribes located north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus include the Cornovii in Caithness, the Caereni, Smertae, Carnonacae, Decantae, Lugi and Creones also north of the Great Glen, the Taexali in the north-east, the Epidii in Argyll, the Venicones in Fife, the Caledonians in the central Highlands and the Vacomagi centred near Strathmore. It is likely that all of these cultures spoke a form of Celtic language known as Pritennic. The occupants of southern Scotland were the Damnonii in the Clyde valley, the Novantae in Galloway, the Selgovae on the south coast and the Votadini to the east. These peoples may have spoken a form of Brythonic language. Despite the discovery of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland there is still a great deal that remains to be explained about the nature of the Celtic life in the early Christian era. Radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood.Smith and Banks (2002) p. 219. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.Smith and Banks (2002) p. 218 and p. 220. The peoples of early Iron Age Scotland, particularly in the north and west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 to 300 with the most imposing structures having been created around the 2nd century . The most massive constructions that date from this time are the circular broch towers. On average, the ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed 6.5 m (21 ft) in height.Armit (2003) p. 55. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland.Armit (2003) p. 16. Euan MacKie has proposed a total of 104, although The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland identify a total of 571 candidate sites. Despite extensive research, their purpose and the nature of the societies that created them are still a matter of debate.Smith and Banks (2002) p. 218 In some parts of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of recorded history right up to the present day, there does not seem to have been a hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.Armit, Ian \\"Land and freedom: Implications of Atlantic Scottish settlement patterns for Iron Age land- holding and social organisation.\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 15‚Äì26. Over 400 souterrains have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south- east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. The purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.Miket, Roger \\"The souterrains of Skye\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 77‚Äì110. \\"A gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands\\" Scotland also has numerous vitrified forts but again an accurate chronology has proven to be evasive. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, using a variety of techniques, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries or the mid-1st millennium. The lack of Roman artifacts (common in local souterrain sites) suggests that many sites were abandoned before the arrival of the legions.Alexander, Derek \\"The oblong fort at Finavon, Angus\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 45‚Äì54. Unlike the earlier Neolithic and Bronze Ages, which have provided massive monuments to the dead, Iron Age burial sites in Scotland are rare, and a recent find at Dunbar may provide further insight into the culture of this period. A similar site of a warrior's grave at Alloa has been provisionally dated to 90‚Äì130.Smith and Banks (2002) p. 220.\\"The Dunbar Iron Age Warrior Grave\\" AOC. Retrieved 14 July 2008.\\"A Brief History of Alloa: Iron Age Warrior\\", Alloa.org.uk; retrieved 14 July 2008. A traveller called Demetrius of Tarsus related to Plutarch the tale of an expedition to the west coast in or shortly before 83\\\\. He stated that it was \\"a gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands\\" but that he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men. He mentioned neither the druids nor the name of the island.Moffat (2005) pp. 239‚Äì40. The invasion of Caledonia 200px The apparently cordial beginnings recorded in Colchester did not last. We know nothing of the foreign policies of the senior leaders in mainland Scotland in the 1st century, but by 71 the Roman governor Quintus Petillius Cerialis had launched an invasion.Moffat (2005) p. 229. The Votadini, who occupied the south-east of Scotland, came under Roman sway at an early stage and Cerialis sent one division north through their territory to the shores of the Firth of Forth. The XXth Legion took a western route through Annandale in an attempt to encircle and isolate the Selgovae who occupied the central Southern Uplands.Moffat (2005) pp. 230‚Äì31.Moffat (2005) p. 247. Early success tempted Cerialis further north and he began constructing a line of Glenblocker forts to the north and west of the Gask Ridge which marked a frontier between the Venicones to the south and the Caledonians to the north.Moffat (2005) p. 233. In the summer of 78 Gnaeus Julius Agricola arrived in Britain to take up his appointment as the new governor. Two years later his legions constructed a substantial fort at Trimontium near Melrose. Excavations in the 20th century produced significant finds including the foundations of several successive structures, Roman coins and pottery. Remains from the Roman army were also found, including a collection of Roman armour (with ornate cavalry parade helmets), and horse fittings (with bronze saddleplates and studded leather chamfrons). Agricola is said to have pushed his armies to the estuary of the \\"River Taus\\" (usually assumed to be the River Tay) and established forts there, including a legionary fortress at Inchtuthil.Although \\"Taus\\" is usually interpreted as referring to the Rivert Tay/Firth of Tay, it has been suggested it was the Solway Firth. It cannot be the latter if Agricola was already campaigning much further north and Cerialis had previously reached the Gask Ridge.

The findings also included clay-domed ovens and 26 fire pits dated to between 77- 86 AD and 90 AD loaded with burn and charcoal contents. Archaeologists suggested that this site had been chosen as a strategic location for the Roman conquest of Ayrshire. Mons Graupius Statue of Gnaeus Julius Agricola In the summer of 84 the Romans faced the massed armies of the Caledonians at the Battle of Mons Graupius. Agricola, whose forces included a fleet, arrived at the site with light infantry bolstered with British auxiliaries. It is estimated that a total of 20,000 Romans faced 30,000 Caledonian warriors.Tacitus, Agricola 29. Wikisource.Other estimates for the size of the Roman force based on Tacitus' account range from 17,000 to 30,000. See Hanson (2003) p. 203. Agricola put his auxiliaries in the front line, keeping the legions in reserve, and relied on close-quarters fighting to make the Caledonians' unpointed slashing swords useless. Even though the Caledonians were put to rout and therefore lost this battle, two thirds of their army managed to escape and hide in the Scottish Highlands or the \\"trackless wilds\\" as Tacitus called them. Battle casualties were estimated by Tacitus to be about 10,000 on the Caledonian side and roughly 360 on the Roman side. A number of authors have reckoned the battle to have occurred in the Grampian Mounth within sight of the North Sea. In particular, Roy,Roy, William (1793) The Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain. Surenne, Watt, Hogan and others have advanced notions that the site of the battle may have been Kempstone Hill, Megray Hill or other knolls near the Raedykes Roman camp. These points of high ground are proximate to the Elsick Mounth, an ancient trackway used by Romans and Caledonians for military manoeuvres.Hogan, C.

Calgacus The first resident of Scotland to appear in history by name was Calgacus (\\"the Swordsman\\"), a leader of the Caledonians at Mons Graupius, who is referred to by Tacitus in the Agricola as \\"the most distinguished for birth and valour among the chieftains\\". Tacitus even invented a speech for him in advance of the battle in which he describes the Romans as: Aftermath Calgacus' fate is unknown but, according to Tacitus, after the battle Agricola ordered the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north of Scotland to confirm that Britain was an island and to receive the surrender of the Orcadians. It was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain.Tacitus claims that Orkney was \\"discovered and subdued\\", but Thomson (2008) pp. 4‚Äì5 is as sceptical about Tacitus's claims on behalf of Agricola as he is about Claudius's earlier subjugation of Orkney (see above). However, the Roman historian Cassius Dio reports that this circumnavigation resulted in Titus receiving his 15th acclamation as emperor in 79\\\\.

In addition, the material to construct the forts was substantial, estimated at 1 million cubic feet (28,315 m3) of timber during the 1st century. Ten tons of buried nails were discovered at the Inchtuthil site, which may have had a garrison of up to 6,000 men and which itself consumed 30 linear kilometres of wood for the walls alone, which would have used up 100 hectares (247 acres) of forest.Hanson (2003) p. 206.Moffat (2005) p. 267.Smout (2007) p. 32. Soon after his announcement of victory, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian and his post passed to an unknown successor, possibly Sallustius Lucullus. Agricola's successors were seemingly unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. This inability to continue to hold the far north may be in part due to the limited military resources available to the Roman Proconsul after the recall of the Legio II Adiutrix from Britain, to support Domitian's war in Dacia. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself fell out of favour and it is possible that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is possible that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves.Moffat (2005) p. 245. By 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands and by the end of the 1st century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth.Hanson (2003) p. 195. Presumably as a consequence of the Roman advance, various hill forts such as Dun Mor in Perthshire, which had been abandoned by the natives long ago, were re-occupied. Some new ones may even have been constructed in the northeast, such as Hill O'Christ's Kirk in Aberdeenshire.Moffat (2005) p. 266. Settlements and southern brochs Edin's Hall Broch, showing intramural chambers Ptolemy's Geography identifies 19 \\"towns\\" from intelligence gathered during the Agricolan campaigns. No archaeological evidence of any truly urban places has been found from this time and the names may have indicated hill forts or temporary market and meeting places. Most of the names are obscure: Devana may be the modern Banchory; Alauna (\\"the rock\\") in the west is probably Dumbarton Rock and the place of the same name in the east Lowlands may be the site of Edinburgh Castle. Lindon may be Balloch on Loch Lomond side.Moffat (2005) pp. 268‚Äì70. There are the remains of various broch towers in southern Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence so far from the main centres of broch-building is something of a mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come at the hands of the Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar. Edin's Hall Broch in Berwickshire is the best preserved southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar to some of the larger Orcadian broch villages it is unlikely that the tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations.Armit (2003) pp. 119‚Äì31. It is also possible that their construction had little to do with Roman frontier policy and was simply the importation of a new style by southern elites or it may have been a response by such elites to the growing threat of Rome prior to the invasion and an attempt to ally themselves, actually or symbolically, with the north that was largely free of Roman hegemony.Armit (2003) p. 132.

Duncan (1989) p. 23. Antonine Wall Quintus Lollius Urbicus was made governor of Roman Britain in 138, by the new Emperor Antoninus Pius. Urbicus was the son of a Libyan landownerFreeman, Charles (1999) Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Oxford University Press. p. 508; . and a native of Numidia (modern Algeria). Prior to coming to Britain he served during the Jewish Rebellion (132‚Äì35), and then governing Germania Inferior. Antoninus Pius soon reversed the containment policy of his predecessor Hadrian, and Urbicus was ordered to begin the reconquest of Lowland Scotland by moving north. Between 139 and 140 he rebuilt a fort at Corbridge and by 142 or 143, commemorative coins were issued celebrating a victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland , probably using the 2nd Augustan Legion. He evidently campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against the lowland tribes of Scotland, the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde. His total force may have been about 16,500 men.Hanson (2003) p. 203. It seems likely that Urbicus planned his campaign of attack from Corbridge, advancing north and leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Trimontium as he struck towards the Firth of Forth. Having secured an overland supply route for military personnel and equipment along Dere Street, Urbicus very likely set up a supply port at Carriden for the supply of grain and other foodstuffs before proceeding against the Damnonii. The course of the Antonine Wall, at Bar Hill Success was swift and the construction of a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde commenced. Contingents from at least one British legion are known to have assisted in the erection of the new turf barrier, as evidenced by an inscription from the fort at Old Kilpatrick, the Antonine Wall's western terminus. Today, the sward-covered wall is the remains of a defensive line made of turf circa 7 metres (20 ft) high, with nineteen forts. It was constructed after 139 and extended for . It was possibly after the defences were finished that Urbicus turned his attention upon the fourth lowland Scottish tribe, the Novantae who inhabited the Dumfries and Galloway peninsula. The main lowland tribes, sandwiched as they were between Hadrian's Wall of stone to the south and the new turf wall to the north, later formed a confederation against Roman rule, collectively known as the Maeatae. The Antonine Wall had a variety of purposes. It provided a defensive line against the Caledonians. It cut off the Maeatae from their Caledonian allies and created a buffer zone north of Hadrian's Wall. It also facilitated troop movements between east and west, but its main purpose may not have been primarily military. It enabled Rome to control and tax trade and may have prevented potentially disloyal new subjects of Roman rule from communicating with their independent brethren to the north and coordinating revolts.Breeze (2006) pp. 144‚Äì59.According to Robertson (1960) p. 39 many of the Antonine forts had strong defences to the south and other Roman forts in southern Scotland actually faced south. Urbicus achieved an impressive series of military successes, but like Agricola's they were short-lived. Having taken twelve years to build, the wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160.\\"History\\", antoninewall.org; retrieved 25 July 2008.Breeze (2006) p. 167. The destruction of some of the southern brochs may date to the Antonine advance, the hypothesis being that whether or not they had previously been symbols of Roman patronage they had now outlived their usefulness from a Roman point of view. 3rd century The Roman frontier became Hadrian's Wall again, although Roman incursions into Scotland continued.

Roman troops, however, penetrated far into the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, there is a greater density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe, as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after 197.Robertson (1960) p. 37. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy. Severus invaded Caledonia with an army perhaps over 40,000 strong.W.S. Hanson (2002) \\"Roman campaigns north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus: the evidence of the temporary camps\\" (PDF), ads.ahds.ac.uk; retrieved 14 March 2011. According to Dio Cassius, he inflicted genocidal depredations on the natives and incurred the loss of 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics, although it is likely that these figures are a significant exaggeration.Hanson (2003) p. 203 suggests the total Roman force was 40‚Äì50,000 and according to Breeze (2006) p.42, the total Roman garrison of Britain at the time of the construction of the Antonine Wall included three legions and numbered about 48,700 troops. A string of forts was constructed in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely known to have been permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213.Hanson (2003) p. 198. There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.Miket, Roger \\"The souterrains of Skye\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 82. By 210, Severus' campaigning had made significant gains, but his campaign was cut short when he fell fatally ill, dying at Eboracum in 211. Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again: they soon withdrew south permanently to Hadrian's Wall.Cassius Dio, Roman History. Book 77. Sections 11‚Äì15. It was during the negotiations to purchase the truce necessary to secure the Roman retreat to the wall that the first recorded utterance, attributable with any reasonable degree of confidence, to a native of Scotland was made. When Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife (whose name is unknown) of the Caledonian chief Argentocoxos allegedly replied: \\"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest.\\"Cassius Dio \\"Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXVII\\".

The name itself is a Roman one, as used by Tacitus, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder and Lucan,Moffat (2005) pp. 21‚Äì22. but the name by which the Caledonians referred to themselves is unknown. It is likely that the prior to the Roman invasions, political control in the region was highly decentralised and no evidence has emerged of any specific Caledonian military or political leadership.Woolliscroft, D. J. \\"More Thoughts On Why the Romans Failed To Conquer Scotland\\" The Roman Gask Project. Retrieved 10 September 2016. Wooliscroft notes that Calgacus \\"is never referred to by any term, such as king or general\\". Later excursions by the Romans were generally limited to the scouting expeditions in the buffer zone that developed between the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The Ravenna Cosmography utilises a 3rd- or 4th-century Roman map and identifies four loci (meeting places, possibly markets) in southern Scotland. Locus Maponi is possibly the modern Lochmabenstane near Gretna which continued to be used as a muster point well into the historic period. Two of the others indicate meeting places of the Damnonii and Selgovae, and the fourth, Manavi may be Clackmannan.Moffat (2005) p. 284. Loci implied supervised meeting places rather than potentially hostile ones, but it is scarcely credible that military interventions of this nature were a regular occurrence at this time. From the time of Caracalla onwards, no further attempts were made to permanently occupy territory in Scotland. Picts Clach an Tiompain, a Pictish symbol stone in Strathpeffer The intermittent Roman presence in Scotland coincided with the emergence of the Picts, a confederation of tribes who lived to the north of the Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century. They are often assumed to have been the descendants of the Caledonians though the evidence for this connection is circumstantial and the name by which the Picts called themselves is unknown.The Greek word Œ†ŒπŒ∫œÑŒøŒØ (Latin Picti) first appears in a panegyric written by Eumenius in 297 and is taken to mean \\"painted or tattooed people\\".The nature of the relationship between the Picts and the Caledonians is obscure. There are 3rd- and 4th- century Roman references to ' and ' and Ammianus Marcellinus states that the Picts consisted of the tribes of the Dicalydonae and the Verturiones. The idea that the Picts were heirs to the Caledonians would appear to be a convenient simplification of a complex flux of relationships. See for example Moffat (2005) p. 297 or \\"The Picts\\" (Siliconglen.com; retrieved 8 February 2009) for a more informal overview. They are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their monumental stones.For art in general see for example Foster (2004) pp. 26‚Äì28. The Gaels of Dalriada called the Picts Cruithne,The Cruithni are discussed by Byrne (1973) pp. 106‚Äì109.The Britons in the south knew the Picts as Prydyn.

Reconstructed crannog on Loch Tay The Pictish relationship with Rome appears to have been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties from both sides of the frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia.Moffat (2005) pp. 284, 299. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through. The technology of everyday life is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows it to have been similar to that in Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of watermills in Pictland and kilns were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise easy in the changeable, temperate climate.Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 52‚Äì53. Although constructed in earlier times, brochs, roundhouses and crannogs remained in use into and beyond the Pictish period.Armit (2003) pp 135‚Äì7.Crone, B.A. (1993) \\"Crannogs and Chronologies\\".

Elsewhere in Scotland wheelhouses were constructed, probably for ritualistic purposes, in the west and north. Their geographical locations are highly restricted, which suggests that they may have been contained within a political or cultural frontier of some kind and the co-incidence of their arrival and departure being associated with the period of Roman influence in Scotland is a matter of ongoing debate. It is not known whether the culture that constructed them was \\"Pictish\\" as such although they would certainly have been known to the Picts.Crawford, Iain \\"The wheelhouse\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 127‚Äì28. As Rome's power waned, the Picts were emboldened. War bands raided south of Hadrian's Wall in earnest in 342, 360, and 365 and they participated with the Attacotti in the Great Conspiracy of 367. Rome fought back, mounting a campaign under Count Theodosius in 369 which re√´stablished a province which was renamed Valentia in honor of the emperor. Its location is unclear, but it is sometimes placed on or beyond Hadrian's Wall. Another campaign was mounted in 384, but both were short-lived successes. Rome had fully withdrawn from Britain by 410, never to return.Moffat (2005) pp. 297‚Äì301. Modern study fort at Cawdor is located near Inverness.

The military presence of Rome lasted for little more than 40 years for most of Scotland and only as much as 80 years in total anywhere. It's now generally considered that at no time was even half of Scotland's land mass under Roman control. Scotland has inherited two main features from the Roman period, although mostly indirectly: the use of the Latin script for its languages and the emergence of Christianity as the predominant religion. Through Christianity, the Latin language would become used by the natives of Scotland for the purposes of church and government for centuries more. Roman influence assisted the spread of Christianity throughout Europe, but there is little evidence of a direct link between the Roman Empire and Christian missions north of Hadrian's Wall. Traditionally, Ninian is credited as the first bishop active in Scotland. He is briefly mentioned by Bede who states that around 397 he set up his base at Whithorn in the south-west of Scotland, building a stone church there, known as Candida Casa. More recently it has been suggested that Ninian was the 6th-century missionary Finnian of Moville,Clancy, Thomas O. (2001) \\"The real St Ninian.\\" The Innes Review 52 pp. 1‚Äì28.Fraser, James E. \\"Northumbrian Whithorn and the Making of St Ninian.\\" (2002) The Innes Review, 53 pp. 40‚Äì59 but either way Roman influence on early Christianity in Scotland does not seem to have been significant. Although little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of military occupation,Hanson (2003) 195. Imperial Rome was ruthless and brutal in pursuit of its ends.For example, it is clear that an Iron Age village at Cardean in Angus was simply removed wholesale in order to construct a Roman Camp. See Moffat (2005) p. 254. Genocide was a familiar part of its foreign policy and it is clear that the invasions and occupations cost thousands of lives. Alistair Moffat writes: All the more surprising given that the Vindolanda tabletsHogan, C. Michael, (2007) \\"Vindolanda Roman Fort\\" in The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham. Retrieved 24 July 2008. show that the Roman nickname for the north British locals was Brittunculi meaning \\"nasty little Britons\\". Similarly, William Hanson concludes that: The Romans' part in the clearances of the once extensive Caledonian forest remains a matter of debate.Hanson (2003) pp. 208‚Äì10. That these forests were once considerably more extensive than they are now is not in dispute, but the timing and causes of the reduction are. The 16th-century writer Hector Boece believed that the woods in Roman times stretched north from Stirling into Atholl and Lochaber and was inhabited by white bulls with \\"crisp and curland mane, like feirs lionis\\".Smout (2007) p.20. Later historians such as P. F. Tytler and W. F. Skene followed suit as did the 20th- century naturalist Frank Fraser Darling. Modern techniques, including palynology and dendrochronology suggest a more complex picture. Changing post- glacial climates may have allowed for a maximum forest cover between 4000 and 3000 and deforestation of the Southern uplands, caused both climatically and anthropogenically, was well underway by the time the legions arrived.Smout (2007) pp.20‚Äì32. Extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife suggest that arable land spread at the expense of forest from about 2000 until the 1st-century Roman advance. Thereafter, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for a period of five centuries, suggesting the invasions had a very negative impact on the native population.Smout (2007) p. 34. The situation outside the Roman- held areas is harder to assess, but the long-term influence of Rome may not have been substantial. 200px The archaeological legacy of Rome in Scotland is of interest, but sparse, especially in the north. Almost all the sites are essentially military in nature and include about of roads.Hanson (2003) p. 202.Moffat (2005) p. 249. Overall, it is hard to detect any direct connections between native architecture and settlement patterns and Roman influence.Ralston, Ian B. M. and Armit, Ian \\"The early Historic Period: An Archaeological Perspective\\" in Edwards and Ralston (2003) p. 218. Elsewhere in Europe, new kingdoms and languages emerged from the remnants of the once- mighty Roman world. In Scotland, the Celtic Iron Age way of life, often troubled, but never extinguished by Rome, simply re-asserted itself. In the north the Picts continued to be the main power prior to the arrival and subsequent domination of the Scots of Dalriada. The Damnonii eventually formed the Kingdom of Strathclyde based at Dumbarton Rock. South of the Forth, the Welsh speaking Brythonic kingdoms of Yr Hen Ogledd (English: \\"The Old North\\") flourished during the 5th‚Äì7th centuries. The most enduring Roman legacy may be that created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created a distinction between the northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as there is little to suggest its influence played an important role in the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.Koch (2006) p. 903 notes that yr Hen Ogledd refers to the Welsh-speaking parts of northern Britain north and south of Hadrian's Wall and that these areas were \\"as integral to the Welsh tradition as Wales itself\\". In fiction The 9th Spanish Legion participated in the Roman invasion of Britain, suffering losses under Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the rebellion of Boudica of 61, and setting up a fortress in 71 that later became part of Eboracum. Although some authors have claimed that the 9th Legion disappeared in 117,For example, Churchill, Winston (1956) A History of the English-Speaking Peoples vol.1. there are extant records for it later than that year, and it was probably annihilated in the east of the Roman Empire.\\"Legio VIIII Hispana\\" Livius.org. Retrieved 26 July 2008. For a time it was believed, at least by some British historians, that the legion vanished during its conflicts in present-day Scotland. This idea was used in the novels The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff, Legion From the Shadows by Karl Edward Wagner, Red Shift by Alan Garner, Engine City by Ken MacLeod, Warriors of Alavna by N. M. Browne, and in the feature films The Last Legion, Centurion and The Eagle.

He also served as a Union Army general during the early part of the American Civil War. After the war Hamilton entered law enforcement and engaged in manufacturing. Early life Hamilton, the son of Zeyn Alasman & Sylvania (Putnam) Hamilton was born in Westernville, New York. He attended the United States Military Academy and graduated in 1843, standing 26th out of 39 cadets. He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry. Hamilton was promoted to second lieutenant on November 17, 1845, in the 5th U.S. Infantry, and promoted to first lieutenant on June 30, 1847.Eicher, p. 275. During the Mexican-American War, he received a brevet promotion to captain for the battles of Contreras and Churubusco and was wounded in the Battle of Molino del Rey. He married Sophia Jane Shepard on February 9, 1849 in Chicago, Illinois. He resigned from the U.S. Army on April 30, 1853, moved to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and became a farmer and miller. Civil War Hamilton in his major general's uniform Hamilton chose to follow the Union cause and was appointed colonel of the 3rd Wisconsin Infantry on May 11, 1861, and was promoted to brigadier general on May 17. He was then given brigade command in Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks' division of the Army of the Potomac. At the outset of the Peninsula Campaign, Hamilton was given command of the 3rd Division, III Corps. He led this division during the Siege of Yorktown, but drew the ire of George B. McClellan for insubordination. Ignoring the fact that shelving Hamilton would create powerful political enemies, McClellan relieved Hamilton on April 30, 1862 without explanation. When Lincoln pointed out the impropriety of McClellan's action, McClellan claimed \\"You cannot do anything better calculated to injure my army ... than to restore Gen. Hamilton to his division.\\"Sears, p. 273 Before the month-long siege preparations were complete, Hamilton was transferred to the Western Theater where he commanded the 3rd Division in the Army of the Mississippi at the battles of Iuka and Corinth. Following Corinth in October 1862, he was promoted to major general, effective from September 19, 1862. During his brief military service in the conflict, Hamilton served in both the eastern and western theaters. He commanded divisions, \\"wings\\"Wings in the context of the Civil War refers to groupings of divisions and more frequently corps, often temporary, within field armies. and corps of the Army of the Potomac, the Army of the Mississippi, as well as in the Army of the Tennessee. During the months of January and February 1863 Hamilton was in simultaneous command of the Dist. of West Tennessee, Dist. of Corinth, the Left Wing of the XVI Corps, and the XVI Corps. While in command at Corinth, he began intriguing for higher command against Generals Hurlbut and James B. McPherson, which drew Grant's ire. When Grant ordered him to Vicksburg to serve under General John Alexander McClernand, Hamilton offered his resignation from the U.S. Army on April 13, 1863. Grant gladly accepted the resignation, forwarding several pages of documentation to Washington to support his case. Later years After his army service Hamilton became a U.S. marshal and a paper manufacturer. He died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1891 and is buried there in Forest Home Cemetery.

The zero flag is typically abbreviated Z or ZF or similar in most documentation and assembly languages. Along with a carry flag, a sign flag and an overflow flag, the zero flag is used to check the result of an arithmetic operation, including bitwise logical instructions. It is set to 1, or true, if an arithmetic result is zero, and reset otherwise. This includes results which are not stored, as most traditional instruction sets implement the compare instruction as a subtract where the result is discarded. It is also common that processors have a bitwise AND-instruction that does not store the result. In most processors, the zero flag is mainly used in conditional branch instructions, which alter control flow on previous instruction results, but there are often other uses as well. In some instruction sets such as the MIPS architecture, a dedicated flag register is not used; jump instructions instead check a register for zero.

It was established by a royal charter as Morpeth Grammar School and later as King Edward VI Grammar School. The school became a comprehensive school in the 1970s and an academy in December 2011. It is locally known as \\"KEVI\\" or simply \\"King Edward's\\". In 2011, the school became part of The Three Rivers Learning Trust. History The school was originally founded as a chantry school in the early 14th century and was located in the Morpeth Chantry. The school was refounded in 1552 as the Free Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, being commonly referred to as the Morpeth Grammar School by locals. The reopening of the school is frequently associated with William Turner (c. 1508‚Äì1568), a nonconformist divine. He is known as the \\"Father of English Botany\\", was a native of Morpeth, and is believed to have attended the grammar school before attending Cambridge University and later to have returned to be its headmaster. Morpeth Grammar School was the plaintiff in a lawsuit of the longest duration in English legal history. The case started in 1710 and concerned the recovery of lands granted to the school by Edward VI and later leased to the Thornton family. The case was reopened in 1833, advanced in 1847, and determined in 1870. By the 1940s the school was known as King Edward VI Grammar School. The school lost its status as a grammar school in the educational reforms of the 1970s and became a comprehensive. A new school building was opened in 1967 to accommodate the boys' and girls' grammar schools, although they remained segregated until the new educational reforms took effect.  Present day  The King Edward VI School was awarded Beacon School status in 2003, and Leading Edge status in 2004. The school officially gained academy status on 1 December 2011. The current building was constructed in 1973. The school was one of the first few schools to have two specialisms. Management The headteacher is Clare Savage. The Chair of the Board of Directors is Paul Carvin.  Ofsted  As of 2020, the school's most recent Ofsted report was in 2014, when the school was judged as outstanding in all five categories. Exam results In 2016, Year 11 students achieved excellent GCSE results, the best in Northumberland. Eighty per cent of students achieved five or more passes at Grades A*‚ÄìC, with 80 per cent gaining five or more including English and Maths, which was the highest percentage in Northumberland. Over 250 students from Year 11 have now moved into the 6th Form at King Edwards. In the same year, A Level students at the King Edward VI School produced excellent results. There was an increase in the percentage of A*‚ÄìB grades to 53 per cent, an improvement of 5 per cent over the previous year. The overall A*‚ÄìE pass rate increased to 99 per cent. The average points score per student came out at 838.9, which was the highest of any school in Northumberland. Observatory In 2014, students from the school's space club, KEVISA (KEVI Space Agency), designed and built an astronomical observatory on the school's former dry ski slope, securing funding from several sources. Housing an 11-inch telescope, the observatory is used for enrichment activities involving students, and events throughout the year where members of the public can learn about astronomy. New buildings The school, to accommodate a rising number of students, installed portacabins to house extra classes and registration forms. They have also recently renovated the old caretaker's house into a new music school. They have also recently built a new science block - with two laboratory classrooms - known as the Mulberry Science Centre. Music department The school music department hosts many music clubs, including three choirs, a jazz band, steel band, ceilidh band and full community orchestra formed of students, parents and other local musicians. The department also produces biennial school musicals. The department has a number of practice rooms, an Apple Mac computer classroom, recording studio and rehearsal room. Year 9 commemoration service The school stands at the top of Cottingwood Lane and, in a long-standing tradition, all Year 9 students take part in a commemoration service in St James's Church which sits at the bottom of the lane. It is intended to give students a short history of the school and introduce them to the school's values and ideals. The service consists of a number of short readings from staff and students, accompanied by songs from the school choir.

Along with the Serge-Marcil Bridge, it is one of two toll bridges in Quebec.  Toponymy  Before May 2012, the bridge was called the A25 Bridge. It was then renamed to commemorate Olivier Charbonneau (1613-1687), French frontiersman and first inhabitant of √éle J√©sus, where the city of Laval now stands.  History  The Olivier Charbonneau Bridge was part of a -long project for the completion of Highway 25, and allows cars, trucks and buses to avoid the Pie IX Bridge upstream. It also provides a route around the city of Montreal by connecting Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Tunnel to Highway 440, thus allowing motorists to avoid the congested Metropolitan Expressway. It is the second modern toll bridge built in Quebec and the first ever built in the Montreal Metropolitan Area since the abolition of toll fares on Champlain bridge in 1990. The long anticipated construction began in early 2008, despite a last-ditch attempt by Greenpeace to block the project, and the bridge was opened to traffic on May 21, 2011, at 12:30pm (EDT). It was completed on time and on budget for $500 million.  Characteristics  The Olivier Charbonneau Bridge is a high cable-stayed bridge carrying 6 lanes of Quebec Autoroute 25, thus 3 lanes per direction, separated by a central reservation. A cycling path is also available on the east side of the bridge. In June 2011, shortly after the bridge's opening, over 25,000 vehicles were crossing the bridge daily. A year later, in May 2012, over 35,000 vehicles were already crossing the bridge every day, for a total of 12.8 million per year.  Administration and Electronic Toll  The bridge is the property of Concession A25, S.E.C. , a limited partnership regrouping the Macquarie Group and construction enterprises. Such a partnership is a funding model between the government and a private company. The Olivier Charbonneau Bridge is yet one of the rare infrastructure construction projects using such a funding model. The bridge uses an electronic toll system that allows cars to cross without having to stop at a traditional booth, ultimately reducing traffic. Users can activate an A25 client account at www.A25.com and install a transponder (electronic sticker) on their vehicle's windshield. Crossing the bridge without a transponder triggers the system to automatically take a picture of the vehicle's license plate and send an invoice by mail. Users must settle the bridge-crossing toll and the applicable administration fees in the prescribed time, otherwise additional collection charges may be added to the toll. The fee schedule varies on the vehicle's size (over or under 230 cm in length), the crossing time of day and the traffic when over a certain threshold. Pedestrians, cyclists and, since January 1, 2016, electric vehicles can cross the bridge for free.

This symbiosis between Oophila and the salamander may exist beyond the oocyte and early embryonic stage. Chlorophyll autofluorescence observation and ribosomal DNA analysis suggest that this algal species has invaded embryonic salamander tissues and cells during development and may even be transmitted to the next generation. Oophila amblystomatis are only found in freshwater in woodland ponds. They grow best at a water depth of 30cm with the water temperature being 15C and an air temperature of 14C. Their optimal pH tolerance ranges from 6.26-6.46 and they require an environment where there is 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness.

The brigade was initially formed as a part-time militia formation in the early 1900s in Queensland. During World War I, the brigade was formed in Palestine in July 1918 following the disbandment of the Imperial Camel Corps. At this time, the brigade consisted of two Australian Light Horse regiments and a French cavalry regiment, and was supported by British and New Zealand artillery and machine gun troops. It served in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as part of the Australian Mounted Division, but only saw limited operations before the war ended, taking part in the capture of Damascus in September and October 1918. After the war, the AIF light horse regiments were demobilised and disbanded; however, the brigade briefly existed as a part-time militia formation in Victoria until 1921 when its regiments were reorganised into cavalry brigades. History=Early formation The 5th Light Horse Brigade was initially raised as part of the militia in the early 1900s, being formed sometime between 1902 and 1905. That formation was raised in Queensland, and consisted of only two light horse regiments ‚Äì the 13th and 14th ‚Äì both of which were part of the Queensland Mounted Infantry. The 13th had depots in Brisbane and its surrounds, spread out to Laidley and Gatton, while the 14th was based around Toowoomba, Warwick, Stanthorpe, Dalby, Roma and other smaller centres. In 1910, the brigade was reorganised when the 15th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry) was added. This unit was based further north around Rockhampton, Bowen, Mackay, Townsville and other smaller depots. By 1912, however, an Army wide reorganisation resulted in the brigade's constituent regiments being redesignated. The 13th Light Horse became the 2nd Light Horse Regiment (QMI), the 14th became the 3rd (Darling Downs) Light Horse Regiment and the 15th was split to provide troops for the 1st (Central Queensland) Light Horse Regiment, 27th (North Queensland) Light Horse Regiment and 4th (Hunter River Lancers) Light Horse Regiment; the last of these was based in New South Wales. Most of these regiments were reallocated to the re-constituted 1st Light Horse Brigade, with the 27th becoming a divisional cavalry regiment. The 5th Light Horse Brigade designation was then re-used for a formation based in Victoria, consisting of the 13th (Gippsland) Light Horse Regiment, the 15th (Victorian Mounted Rifles) Light Horse Regiment and the 16th (Indi) Light Horse Regiment. World War I The Australian Light Horse during World War I At the outbreak of the war August 1914 the Australian Government decided to raise the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) consisting of 20,000 troops comprising an infantry division and a light horse brigade of three regiments to be used at the discretion of Britain. These regiments were raised from volunteers for overseas service, as the provisions of the Defence Act did not allow conscripts to be deployed overseas. Nevertheless, many of the recruits were drawn from the various militia light horse formations created as a consequence of the Kitchener Report 1910 and the introduction of Universal Training, although they were assigned to freshly raised units that were separate to the light horse regiments raised as part of the militia. Initial enlistments outstripped expectations and, as a result, a total of three light horse brigades as well as two divisional cavalry regiments were formed in the early part of the war. Later, this was expanded to include a fourth light horse brigade, although this was broken up in mid-1915 to provide reinforcements to the troops deployed to Gallipoli and was not re-raised until early 1917. After Gallipoli, the Australian light horse formations were used in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The 5th Light Horse Brigade was raised as an AIF formation late in the war, coming into being in Palestine in mid-1918 as part of the expansion and reorganisation of the Desert Mounted Corps. This expansion was made possible by the release of Indian cavalry troops from service in France and the disbandment of the Imperial Camel Corps, which resulted in enough Australian troops to raise several new light horse regiments. Upon formation the brigade was commanded by Brigadier General George Macarthur-Onslow and consisted of two Australian Light Horse Regiments ‚Äì the 14th and 15th ‚Äì as well as a French cavalry regiment and a New Zealand machine gun squadron. The brigade's artillery support was provided by the British who assigned B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company. Barada Gorge where the 5th Light Horse Brigade attacked withdrawing Ottoman and German troops on 30 September 1918 For the offensive in Palestine, the brigade was assigned to the Australian Mounted Division. Prior to their commitment to operations, the troopers were converted from cameleers and were issued swords and received cavalry training. Having been formed late in the war, the 5th Light Horse Brigade's involvement in combat operations was limited to the final offensive of the war, which began with the Battle of Megiddo in late September 1918. During this offensive, the brigade took part in the Battle of Sharon and Battle of Tulkarm, taking a large number of prisoners to the west of the Samaria Ranges. During operations to secure Damascus, the brigade took up positions overlooking the Barada Gorge, helping to cut off withdrawing Ottoman and German troops, and inflicting heavy casualties on them during an ambush on 30 September. The brigade then spent the night there in freezing conditions before elements entered Damascus on 1 October. For the remainder of the month, it was engaged in minor mopping up and patrol operations before joining the final stage of the campaign, which saw the brigade begin the advance towards Aleppo. The advance was short lived, as on 30 October the Ottomans surrendered, and the Armistice of Mudros came into effect, bringing an end to the fighting in the theatre. Disbandment and perpetuation In the final months of 1918, the demobilisation process began, and the brigade spent Christmas around Homs, in Syria. The brigade concentrated with the Australian Mounted Division around Tripoli, before sailing to Egypt in mid-March 1919, establishing camp around Moascar. In late March 1919, elements of the brigade were used to suppress the Egyptian revolt, undertaking patrols and carrying out internal security duties into May. Afterwards, the individual regiments and brigade headquarters returned stores and equipment and embarked for Australia around July 1919. The main body departed Suez on HMAT Dongola and the rear details followed on HMAT Burma, after which they were disbanded. 14th Light Horse Regiment on parade at Homs, Syria on Christmas Day 1918 Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the process of demobilising the AIF continued, although this would not be complete until 1921. At this time, the militia formations that had remained in Australia for home service were reorganised to realign them with the recruitment areas that had contributed to the AIF regiments, and to replicate the AIF's organisational structure and designations. These formations had continued to exist alongside the AIF in Australia, albeit largely on paper only as they had been reduced significantly due to large-scale enlistment in the AIF, and a lack of funds and resources for training. By 1919, a 5th Light Horse Brigade had been formed in the militia, consisting of 13th, 14th and 20th Light Horse Regiments, which were based in Gippsland, Seymour and Shepparton in Victoria. In the first couple of years after the war, plans were made to reorganise the home forces to meet the needs of peacetime while providing a strong base upon which to mobilise if necessary. By 1921, when the AIF was officially disbanded, plans were approved to raise two cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, utilising a mix of voluntary enlistment and compulsory service. At this time, the brigades were designated as cavalry brigades, rather than light horse brigades, and the 5th Light Horse Brigade ceased to exist. Within the new structure, the 13th and 20th Light Horse Regiments became part of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, based in Victoria, while the 14th Light Horse Regiment designation was re-used for a Queensland-based unit that became part of the 1st Cavalry Brigade. At the same time, the 5th Cavalry Brigade was raised around Warrnambool, Bendigo and Ballarat consisting of the 4th, 17th and 19th Light Horse Regiments.

The road is almost entirely two-lanes wide.  Route description  State Road 69 begins at an unnamed connecting road between State Road 71 (North Main Street) and North Pear Street in Blountstown. After passing by the Blountstown Elementary School, a civic center and the intersection of Finlay Street, the route crosses a bridge over Simmons Creek and runs through Pine Island, where it intersects the southern terminus of CR 549 (John G. Bryant Road). North of there, it passes by the Nettle Ridge Cemetery and the church across from it, before crossing another bridge over a tributary of Simmons Creek where the route leaves Pine Island. The next moderate intersection is with CR 69A which branches off to the northwest and has its own intersection with CR 549 merely feet from the southern terminus. SR 69 curves to the northeast, passing over a low bridge over Stafford Creek and then some grass farms north of Parrish Lake Road. North of a bridge over Graves Creek, it enters Selman where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 194. After the intersection of Jody Field Road the route turns straight north again, then approaches an intersection that serves as the twin termini of CRs 274 and 286. The road then curves towards the northwest as it passes beneath a power-line right-of-way, and then dips toward a low culvert over Flowers Creek. As it straightens out again it crosses the Calhoun-Jackson County Line. The route continues to run primarily through forestland, although farmland exists north of the county line, then again north of Bone Yard Road, and again at a point where the road briefly curves to the northwest. Past the intersection with Raylene Road, the route turns more northerly again as it passes by a smaller parcel of private property lined with pine trees in the front yard. The first moderate intersection over the county line is another dual termini, this time of County Roads 278 & 69A, both of which are named Birchwood Road and apparently shared in a concurrency with County Road 280. From there it takes another curve to the northwest that's not as drastic as the previous one, only to turn back the northeast at the intersection of another dirt road. The road becomes a divided highway as it approaches Interstate 10 at Exit 152, and makes a slight curve back to the northwest, but even then remains two-lanes wide until north of the interchange where the approaches to the westbound off and on ramps transform it into a four lane highway, and even that segment ends north of Chips Drive before the divided section does. North of a dirt road leading to an antenna tower, it curves to the northeast, where it encounters a full intersection with a dirt road named Brushey Pond Road, then side roads such as Betty Road, an access road to a sewage treatment plant and Tobe Way. Somewhere north of a dirt road named Scarlet Road, SR 69 picks up the street name \\"Porter Avenue,\\" and turns straight north. From there it encounters the northwestern terminus of County Road 69A (Shady Grove Road), which some maps show as being part of CR 280. Officially entering Grand Ridge SR 69's first intersection is with the Old Spanish Trail, which is also named Florida Street. Less than three and a half block later, it has a grade crossing with CSX's P&A; Subdivision, Its time in Grand Ridge ends right after it passes the Town Hall across from the Grand Ridge Baptist Church. The road still remains two-lanes wide even as it approaches a blinker-light intersection with US 90, although it does contain separated turning ramps on the southeast and northwest corners of the intersection. Beyond US 90 State Road 69 runs past some local and/or private dirt roads, as well as the local Grand Ridge Church of God. North of Shady Oak Lane, Porter Avenue becomes Porter Street, where it briefly runs through some forestland before approaching the temporary eastern terminus of County Road 164A (Reddoch Road), which has an unpaved and unmarked extension along Providence Church Road. Past that intersection, a power line right-of-way crosses the road and a substation on the northwest corner of that right of way marks the beginning of a series of power lines that follow the route. Farmland becomes much more prevalent north of this point. At a dirt road named Columbus Street, the name of State Road 69 changes from Porter Street to Spurlock Road, but after two other dirt roads State Road 69 curves northwest from Spurlock Road, which becomes a dirt road, and the route has no official name other than State Road 69. Around Dellwood the power lines that run along the road branch off to the right onto a former section of the road before the intersection of Bateau Pond Road, and then the route intersects Messer Road, just before the intersection of County Road 164 (Blue Springs Road/Sweet Pond Road), an unfinished county road that spans from southwestern Jackson County to Chattahoochee State Park in Alabama. North of the intersection of Northside Church Road, the power lines return to the street. After three more random intersections with dirt roads, the route enters the farming community of Two Egg just under where that previously mentioned power line branches off onto its own right-of-way, and after this the southern terminus of County Road 69A (Wintergreen Road) veers off to the right and State Road 69 adopts the name Fort Road. A block after this as the road turns more toward the west (although not entirely in that direction, Green Road mergers with SR 69. Between the parallel intersections with Joey and Peters Roads and Kimbell Road SR 69 finally runs straight west. Century Road is the next and last intersection along the road. Entering Greenwood, State Road 69 ends at State Road 71 but Fort Road becomes westbound County Road 162 as it heads for Jacob City, and Holmes County. Major intersectionsRelated routes=County Road 69 County Road 69 is a county extension route of SR 69. It runs from CR 275 in Marysville, through New Hope, past the Calhoun Correctional Institution, and ends at the intersection of SR 71 and Barfield Road, southwest of Blountstown. County Road 69A (Calhoun County) County Road 69A is a county suffixed alternate route of SR 69. It is paved until it approaches the County Line Airstrip, where it then becomes a dirt road named Orlando Road before crossing the Calhoun-Jackson County Line. County Road 69A (Jackson County) County Road 69A is one of two county suffixed alternate routes of SR 69. The first one begins at SR 69 at the eastern terminus of CR 278, from which it acquires a concurrency with CR 280. The CR 69A/280 concurrency crosses a bridge over I-10 with no access and exists until the route reach Shady Grove, where CR 280 turns right, while CR 69A turns left. CR 69A winds toward the northwest until it returns to SR 69 south of Grand Ridge. The second CR 69A begins at the State Road 69 as Wintergreen Road in Two Egg, then runs north until it turns east onto Lovedale Lane where it ends at County Road 164. A third CR 69A which has no connection to SR 69 is described by Florida Department of Transportation maps as being Inwood Road, El Bethel Church Road, and Sandridge Church Road between McKeown Mill Road southeast of Grand Ridge and Welcome Church Road east of Dellwood. No other evidence of the route exists.FDOT Map of Jackson County, including SR 69 and all CR 69A's ReferencesExternal links *Florida Route Log (SR 69) 069 069 069 069 ","title":"Florida State Road 69"},{"id":"18692202","text":"Bradyphrenia is the slowness of thought common to many disorders of the brain.Blueprints Neurology, 2nd ed. Disorders characterized by bradyphrenia include Parkinson's disease and forms of schizophrenia consequently causing a delayed response and fatigue. Patients with bradyphrenia may describe or may manifest slowed thought processes, evidenced by increased latency of response and also involve severe memory impairment and poor motor control. The word 'bradyphrenia' originates from the ancient Greek meaning 'slow mind.'William S. Haubrich,. Medical Meanings : a Glossary of Word Origins [Rev. & expanded ed.]. Philadelphia, Pa: American College of Physicians, 1997 History=Encephalitis Lethargica Era The first sightings of bradyphrenia were documented by French neurologist Naville in the early 20th century, during the time of the epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, as it appears, he was investigating this disorder. The epidemic was a condition of the enlargement of the brain (encephalitis) where patients would experience mental delays and remain motionless for extended periods of time due to an unknown cause. Naville was dealing with patients experiencing several symptoms which he could only describe as a gradual brain impairment. Several symptoms listed included decreased attention span, memory and lack of motivation to perform any tasks. Naville had also observed the facial expressions of his patients suffering from these symptoms' had become stagnant and disinterested over time. Since Naville's publications in 1922, researchers often referred to this condition as 'psychic torpor' being translated as 'mental inactivity.' Post- Encephalitis Lethargica Era Swiss neurologist Steck completed a study investigating the case of bradyphrenia post- an epidemic, in 27 mental institutions. Within his research, he found that more than half of the patients hospitalised were suffering from the condition Following Steck's discovery, for some period there had been no active research into the causes of bradyphrenia. Steck's work stimulated the interest of other neurologists including Aubrun, who investigated bradyphrenia creating a new direction by linking it to Parkinson's disease. Gradually, more neurologists began exploring bradyphrenia in the presence of other disorders including Alzheimer's Disease, loss of motor control and psychiatric disorders. Parkinsonism In his research, Steck found that almost half the patients with Parkinson's Disease in the psychiatric ward during the post-encephalitic period were suffering from Bradyphrenia. Neurologists often saw the condition as an additional trait of Parkinson's Disease as they found that patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease had often impaired traits that would be defined by bradyphrenia. In the study conducted in 1966, Wilson et al had found that bradyphrenia found in the patients with Parkinson's Disease had increased their reaction time of retaining information. Other studies exploring this theory confirmed that bradyphrenia was commonly seen in their studies of patients with Parkinson's Disease In addition, some researchers found that the condition does not impact all patients with Parkinson's Disease. Some neurologists had also suggested that bradyphrenia could exist without the presence of parkinsonism. In some cases, it has been found that bradyphrenia has been mistaken for an inability to strategically complete tasks and therefore may often be categorised as the condition incorrectly. Collectively, it was concluded that bradyphrenia does not commonly appear in parkinsonism but rather as a single entity that occurs in other conditions and not only in the single presence of Parkinson's Disease. Despite the collective agreement of bradyphrenia being classified as a nosological entity. The neurological condition is still more often described in case studies where the subjects are analysed are suffering from Parkinson's Disease. Effects of bradyphrenia in Parkinson's There are several symptoms in Parkinson's Disease which are influenced by the presence of bradyphrenia. Researcher Norberg discovered that a gradual cognitive slowing impacted the eating behaviour of these patients. It was found that patients with Parkinson's Disease would often experience extended periods of time attempting to process the food that they are eating, causing an increase in the time it took for them to consume their food. In another study examining the presence of bradyphrenia in Parkinson's Disease, researchers had discovered that bradyphrenia was one of the reasons for slow auditory feedback as measured by the DAF (Delayed Auditory Feedback). Dobbs et al., completed an experiment whereby the experimenter would communicate to the patient via a microphone and would ask the participant to complete a series of tasks. The participant, with or without Parkinson's Disease, would receive this information through their headphones and respond via a microphone. The experimenters had asked the participants to complete the following tasks; counting to 20, repeat several simple sentences and read a series of words from a card. The researchers concluded that bradyphrenia was present in Parkinson's Disease however also in older patients as they also had delayed feedback when completing the task. Depression and Parkinson's Disease Researchers Rogers et al found bradyphrenia in light of Parkinson's Disease was considerably similar to what is referred to as 'Psychomotor retardation. Psychomotor retardation was proposed by the researchers as a condition particularly seen in major depressive disorders. Researchers had conducted a study to examine in ways in which the two conditions share similarities in analysing diagnosed Parkinson Disease patients and patients who had been diagnosed with depression. The participants were given two tasks to complete, one of the tasks is known as the digit symbol substitution test which consisted of the participants filling in a row of numbers which had a specific connection to a symbol. Another task which been referred to as the 'simpler task' which was to match the number on the screen that they had seen by pressing the same number on the keyboard. Both of these measurements required a fast reaction time as their response was based on how quickly (in seconds) they would respond to each of the tasks. Researchers found that there had been no significant decrease in the response time for this test in participants suffering from Parkinson's disease as their reaction time had been longer. However, for participants suffering major depressive disorder, there had been an overall improvement in reaction time. Rogers, Lees and Smith had then eventually concluded that bradyphrenia explored in the presence of Parkinson's Disease was very similar to psychomotor retardation in a major depressive disorder with a few differences. They had found that there had been notable impairments in their dopaminergic areas seen in both groups of disorders that could call for some similarities between the two conditions. Bradyphrenia and Other Neurological conditions Bradyphrenia is also present within other neurological conditions. Alzheimer's Diseases Alzheimer's Disease, another neurological condition involving cognition impairment. Researchers found that there was a presence of cognitive slowing in patients with Alzheimer's. Pate and Margolin, found that this was caused by damage to the cortical central. The cortical central is the outer region of the cerebellum, a major component of the brain that controls motor functions. Particularly in the older population, evidence of bradyphrenia had been seen in patients suffering from Alzheimer's. Depression Evidence of bradyphrenia in patients with depression had been present if they had previous neurological damage. In a study of elderly patients, it was found that patients suffering from depression had not shown a significant delay in thought processing as did patients with depression and additional neurological damage to a part of their brain. Yet, Rogers et al., examined bradyphrenia and whether or not it was indicated by 'mental rotation' in melancholic and non-melancholic depressed patients. Researchers would ask the participants to participate in numerous tasks whereby their performance would be measured by their reaction time and accuracy of response. The tasks that participants were asked to perform included being able to determine which direction a stimulus on the screen was pointing towards and were also told to determine if a stimulus shown was the normal positioning or whether it had been reversed. From this study, researchers had concluded that in melancholic participants with major depression their slowing in reaction time was higher, in contrast to the control group, which indicated the presence of bradyphrenia. Researchers had drawn the conclusion that the lesser slowness of the non-melancholic depressed groups in these tasks had not been intense enough to draw it to bradyphrenia. Huntington's Disease and Schizophrenia Bradyphrenia had also been observed in Huntington's disease and Schizophrenia. To examine the role of bradyphrenia within these conditions the researchers used the Tower of London Test which is a task that requires cognitive processing. This study had shown that there had been a significant increase in time that it took for patients with Huntington's to solve the problem. Participants suffering from schizophrenia, however, performed the tasks in a smaller amount of time, faster than those in the control group within the experiment. Hanes had suggested that bradyphrenia in schizophrenia was not as common as it was seen in Huntington's disease. Addiction Experts including Martin et al discovered that bradyphrenia is seen as one of the first stages of the ramifications of overdosing on an opioid like heroin. Bradyphrenia, however, had been considered the presence of bradyphrenia to be the most 'minor' of the ramifications. Martin et al found that stage three of symptoms of overdose entailed the high risk around 20% of those that reach what has been described as 'stage three' will die. A case report had been done on a 63-year-old man who had been hospitalised for ten days and has been released with no notable impairments. The patient was hospitalised again several days later after showing abnormal behaviours in which specialists could only describe it as being bradyphrenia. The patient's abnormal behaviour included having a diminished attention span as well as being unable to remember minor details. Researchers had justified this worsening of behaviour by abnormal neurological activity within the pre-frontal cortex. The patient's cognitive abilities had improved with the use of an antioxidant therapy yet with some acts of abnormal behaviours still showing. Treatment Currently, there are no pharmaceutical medications that will directly increase the rate of thoughts in patients with bradyphrenia experience.Eric J Ahlskog. The New Parkinson's Disease Treatment Book : Partnering with Your Doctor to Get the Most from Your Medications 2nd ed. New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 2015. The treatments for Parkinson's Disease have been imposed as a model for treatment of bradyphrenia as in some cases the researchers have been able to treat the condition in patients suffering from Parkinson's. Steroid Therapy During the time of the encephalitis lethargica period, the rise of bradyphrenia was seen in many of the cases. In one case in Russia it was believed that this condition could be treated with steroid therapy after the patient's condition had improved after three months using steroid. Paul Bernard Foley. Encephalitis Lethargica The Mind and Brain Virus New York, NY: Springer New York, 2018. In another more recent case, an 80 year old woman had been diagnosed with Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) and was described to have symptoms of bradyphrenia after showing abnormalities within the pre- frontal cortex of the brain through a magnetic resonance imaging system (MRI) that had shown a significant increase in lesions. The patient had been put on steroid therapy which researchers McHugh et al had found a significant improvement of cognitive abilities over time. The effectiveness of steroid therapy had been observed within an MRI improvement as the number of lesions had decreased as well as the shift in behaviours of participants. Joel A Vilensky. Encephalitis Lethargica : During and after the Epidemic Oxford ;: Oxford University Press, 2011. L-DOPA and Carbidopa Regimen In one trial it was found that bradyphrenia as well as bradykinesia, could be treated using the combination of a L-DOPA and carbidopa regimen. This combination was believed to alter these effects of Parkinson's Disease. In the short term, this combination had brought positive results as behaviours of these patients had improved. Yet these researchers found that in the long-term this combination provided a reverse effect, accelerating the cognitive slowing of the brain (bradyphrenia) and motor movement (bradykinesia). H2 Antagonists H2 antagonists are a class of drugs that was found to provide positive outcomes throughout the treatment. Some studies showed that through oral admission, the H-2 antagonist will target specific receptors in the brain, by crossing the blood-brain barrier and will alter the rate of cognitive thought processing. Psychiatrist Kaminski found that the improvement of this condition will create a positive correlation between the decrease of time in cognitive thought processing and the decrease in reaction time for tasks to be completed.

Originally released by Verve, it has subsequently been reissued on CD by Verve, Universal Japan and Lonehill Jazz. Recording a January 1956 reunion session between Young and Wilson, the album includes six standard swing jazz songs with one original composition, \\"Pres Returns.\\" In spite of Young's failing health, the album is critically acclaimed as among the best of his later works as well as being among the best albums produced by Verve Record's founder Norman Granz. Background Pres and Teddy is one of several late 1950s reunions between Lester Young, a tenor saxophonist characterized by jazz commentator Scott Yanow as \\"one of the giants of Jazz history\\", and Teddy Wilson, \\"the definitive swing pianist\\". Recorded on January 13, 1956, the quartet also featured Jo Jones, an innovative and influential jazz drummer, and bassist Gene Ramey. The group had also played together the previous day along with Roy Eldridge, Vic Dickenson and Freddie Green, recording the similarly acclaimed The Jazz Giants '56. Wilson was in 1956 steadily producing both solo and group albums, having only recently stopped teaching music at Juilliard. Young, although also working steadily, was suffering a rapid deterioration of his health. Though Young had established a strong early presence in jazz prior to being drafted into World War II in 1945, his experiences during the war left him an alcoholic so unapproachable that he invented his own language to better control who would be permitted to communicate with him.Yanow Bebop. pp. 39-40. But while Young's playing throughout the 50s was often hampered by his excessive drinking, on this occasion, according to Yanow, he returned to \\"classic form\\".Yanow Bebop. p. 41. After these sessions, Young continued to decline, drinking himself to death three years later, at the age of 49.Yanow Bebop. p. 40. Critical reception In 1994, The New York Times listed the album as among 10 of the \\"high points\\" of music produced by Norman Granz, who founded the Verve label, describing it as \\"a magnificent set of standards\\". While Yanow recommends the comprehensive box set The Complete Lester Young Studio Sessions on Verve for all of Young's later work, he recommends this album along with The Jazz Giants '56 and Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio for more casual listeners seeking Young's best later work. In his profile of the album for Allmusic, Yanow notes that, \\"[W]hen he was healthy, Young played at his very best during the '50s, adding an emotional intensity to his sound that had not been present during the more carefree days of the '30s,\\" concluding that on Pres and Teddy Young was in \\"particularly expressive form\\".

She was the only U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Passumpsic, after the Passumpsic River in Vermont. Construction and commissioning USS Passumpsic (AO-107) was laid down on 8 March 1945 as Maritime Commission Hull 2703 by Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 31 October 1945, sponsored by Mrs. M. F. Draemel, wife of Rear Admiral Milo F. Draemel, then Commandant of the 4th Naval District, and commissioned on 1 April 1946, Captain C.M.

She visited Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, North Borneo, the Fiji Islands, Australia, Arabia, Ceylon, the Philippines, Midway Atoll, Oahu, the Marshall Islands, and the Mariana Islands. USS Passumpsic as built From June 1950 through February 1954, Passumpsic spent 34 of 44 months outside the United States. Though not subjected to hostile fire during the Korean War, Passumpsic received nine battlestars for her Korean War service. Passumpsic‚Äôs assignments after the Korean War entailed annual deployments to the Western Pacific.  \\"Jumboization\\"  Upon return from deployment in April 1964, Passumpsic underwent an INSURV Board inspection at Long Beach Naval Shipyard in preparation for \\"Jumboization,\\" a project of modernization and renovation for fleet oilers. She steamed on 12 October 1964 for the American Shipbuilding Company yard at Lorain, Ohio, where the conversion was to take place. At Boston Naval Shipyard a Supply Overhaul Assistance Program (SOAP) was set up to sort, identify, and repackage the ship‚Äôs stock of repair parts and to receive, sort, and stow the repair parts supplied by the contractor and the U.S. Navy in conjunction with the conversion programs. After passage through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway, Passumpsic was placed \\"in commission, in reserve\\" on 26 November 1964 and most of her crew detached, leaving a nucleus party of four officers and 28 enlisted men under the command of Lcdr. James. K. Beates. The ship was then turned over to the American Shipbuilding Company. The conversion involved transferring her existing midships superstructure to a newly constructed tank section. The original hull was cut and the bow and stern sections were added to the new tank section. Conversion modifications increased Passumpsics length by , her light displacement from 7,423 tons to 12,840 tons, her full-load displacement from 25,500 to 34,350 tons, and her maximum draft from to . Passumpsic departed Lorain on 22 November 1965 with a merchant marine master and civilian crew. She arrived at the Boston Army Base piers, South Boston, Massachusetts, on 1 December 1965. USS Passumpsic after completion of \\"jumboization\\". Accepted by the U.S. Navy at Boston, on 10 January 1966, Passumpsic fitted out at Boston Naval Shipyard throughout February and into March, departing 5 March 1966 for Norfolk, Virginia, to load oil and for degaussing inspection. Passumpsic departed Norfolk on 11 March 1966 for her home port of Long Beach, California, arriving there on 6 April 1966. Final U.S. Navy acceptance came on 24 August 1966, and she was designated a ready unit under Commander Task Group 13.1 (CTG 13.1) on 1 September 1966.  1966‚Äì73  Passumpsic departed Long Beach on 22 September 1966 and arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands on 15 October 1966. From Subic Bay the oiler steamed on replenishment operations off the coasts of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. She continued to service U.S. Navy units in the Western Pacific until May 1967, when she returned to her home port. Passumpsic departed Long Beach in November 1967 for the Western Pacific and again operated from Subic Bay to serve ships operating in the Vietnam War combat zone and making port visits between underway replenishment assignments. She returned to Long Beach in June 1968. In November 1968 Passumpsic again deployed to the Western Pacific to operate out of Subic Bay in support of ships operating off of Vietnam. She returned to Long Beach 27 June 1969 for yard availability, local training operations, and preparations for her next Western Pacific deployment. Passumpsic remained in commissioned service with the U.S. Navy until 1973, although her activities between mid-1969 and 1973 are not readily available and await further research.The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships history of Passumpsic ends while she was still in commission in 1969 because of the date of publication of the original hard-copy volume of the dictionary and has not been updated, and the level of detail readily available about her later career is minimal at present. On 24 July 1973, Passumpsic was decommissioned. She transferred to the Military Sealift Command on the same day, becoming United States Naval Ship USNS Passumpsic (T-AO-107). Under this new designation, she continued in service in support of the U.S. Navy with a civilian crew from 1975 until 1991.  Later career and disposition  Passumpsic began active service with the Military Sealift Command in 1975. One of her first tasks was a three-month deployment from Subic Bay as part of the 1975-1976 Indian Ocean task group. The task group consisted of the cruiser and the frigates and . The task group was replenished in the Arabian Sea by the supply vessel . At the end of her career, she supported ships operating in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991. USN personnel serving aboard USNS Passumpsic during Operation Desert Storm are eligible for the Combat Action Ribbon. Passumsic provided moorage services for submarines such as the USS Bremerton (SSN698) in 1984 visiting Hong Kong. Passumpsic was in Subic Bay at Luzon in the Philippine Islands when Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, suffering extensive damage to her Underway replenishment (UNREP) gear caused by a mixture of volcanic ash and rain water from a passing typhoon. Passumpsic was stricken from the Navy List in December 1991; sources differ on whether the date was 17 December 1991 or 18 December 1991The discrepancy likely arises because she was in the Philippines when stricken, leading some sources to cite the date in the Philippines at the time of striking and others to cite the date on the other side of the International Date Line in the United States. She was sold to a Singaporean firm for scrapping on 19 December 1991. She was resold to an Indian firm on 1 July 1992 for scrapping in India.

It is the latest in the Crosstime Traffic series. Background In The Valley-Westside War, a global nuclear war broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1967, leading to the collapse of civilization. The book is set in the ruins in what was once Los Angeles, 130 years after the war. The area of the city is controlled by two rival feudal states at war with one another: the Kingdom of Westside and the Kingdom of the Valley. The Crosstime Traffic team is dispatched to investigate the remains of the UCLA library in an attempt to discover what happened to cause the initial nuclear war, but are caught up in the local war by citizens of both kingdoms who believe that they are trying to access the knowledge of the old people to create advanced weapons. Plot summary The Mendoza family, funded by a Crosstime Traffic grant and disguised as traders, return to postwar Earth to learn who initiated the hostilities. Liz Mendoza frequently visits the UCLA library to analyze the period books and magazines, searching for insight and reasons for the conflict. It is on her regular trips to the library that she meets Dan, a Valley soldier whom she initially considers dull and dumb. Dan, however, is not as unschooled and ignorant as Liz thinks, and, although he is attracted to her, he has his misgivings about the Mendozas. His suspicions are confirmed, and he blows their cover and causes them to return to their own time alternate, but not before he asks why someone from a different time, who has the knowledge and expertise to help Earth recover from its postwar havoc, does nothing. Reception The School Library Journal gave the novel a good review saying fans of dystopias would enjoy the story. SF Scope said the novel was \\"an interesting exploration of what a post-apocalyptic world might be\\" but found the characters, except for Liz and Dan, to be little more than ciphers. The Los Angeles Times did not give a positive review describing the book as sloppy and saying it failed to live up to other dystopias based on alternate histories like The Man in the High Castle, The Difference Engine, or The Plot Against America.

After Smith's death in 1844, the church he established splintered into several competing groups. Disagreement over Smith's doctrine of \\"plural marriage\\" has been among the primary reasons for multiple church schisms. The members of the largest faction, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), do not continue to teach and practice polygamy today. In the late-19th century and early-20th century, the practice was formally abandoned as various laws banned polygamy in the United States and led to the confiscation of LDS Church properties. The LDS Church no longer sanctions open polygamy. However, many LDS men are sealed in LDS temples to more than one woman \\"for eternity\\", following the divorce or death of the first wife, the latter example being the case with two current LDS leaders, church president Russell M. Nelson and apostle Dallin H. Oaks. The second- largest Latter Day Saint church, the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints or RLDS Church), has a history of opposing the LDS Church's practice of polygamy. Other smaller Latter Day Saint churches were also formed as a means of opposing the LDS Church's polygamy. The formal shift in doctrine by the LDS Church later in the early-20th century gave rise to the Mormon fundamentalism movement, which has since fragmented into a number of separate churches, the most well-known being the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church). The FLDS Church and other Mormon fundamentalists believe the practice of polygamy should continue and that it was wrongfully abandoned by the LDS Church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Polygamy is condemned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Latter-day Saints believe that monogamy‚Äîthe marriage of one man and one woman‚Äîis the Lord‚Äôs standing law of marriage. However, the LDS Church considers polygamy to have been a divinely inspired commandment that is supported by scripture;See Doctrine and Covenants section 132 and Jacob 2:30. today, the LDS Church teaches the historical aspects in an adult Sunday School lesson once every four years.\\"Lesson 31: 'Sealed ... for Time and for All Eternity'\\", Doctrine and Covenants and Church History: Gospel Doctrine Teacher‚Äôs Manual, (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1999) pp. 176‚Äì82. The LDS official position is God rescinded the commandment to practice plural marriage. Church apostle Joseph F. Smith explained, \\"The doctrine is not repealed, the truth is not annulled, the law is right and just now as ever, but the observance of it is stopped\\".Letter from Joseph F. Smith to the Honorable A. Saxey, Provo, Utah, 9 January 1897. The LDS Church has not officially tolerated plural marriages since the 1890 Manifesto. However, all of the First Presidency and almost all of the apostles of the time continued to maintain multiple families into the 20th century, feeling they could not dissolve existing unions and families. Research beginning in the 1980s estimated the average incidence of polygamy during the 70 years in which it was a practice of the LDS Church was 15% to 30%, depending on the years and location,. including virtually all church leadership at the time.Bachman, Danel W., Esplin, Ronald K. (1992) \\"Plural Marriage\\", in Ludlow, Daniel H, Encyclopedia of Mormonism 3:1095. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co. Polygamy was gradually discontinued after the 1904 Second Manifesto as no new plural marriages were allowed and older polygamists eventually died, with polygamous LDS families cohabitating into the 1940s and 1950s. Since the Second Manifesto, the policy of the LDS Church has been to excommunicate members who practice, officiate, or openly encourage the practice of plural marriages. However, LDS leaders even in the late 20th century, such Joseph Fielding Smith have acknowledged the belief in polygamy in the afterlife, in the case of a widower becoming sealed in eternal marriage to a second wife after the death of the first wife. In such a case, a man can be married to two or more women in the celestial kingdom. Relationship of current practices to plural marriage As of 1998, by proxy \\"A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. However, if she was sealed to a husband during her life, all her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed to a husband to whom she was not sealed during life.\\"LDS Church, Church Handbook of Instructions, (LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1998). \\"A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. However, if she was sealed to a husband during her life, all her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed to a husband to whom she was not sealed during life.\\" Theological issues persist as the LDS Church states marriage relationships continue into an afterlife, yet people may only have one living spouse.  History of polygamy  The LDS Church began to practice polygamy in secret under the leadership of prophet Joseph Smith. When Utah became a territory in 1851, Brigham Young was appointed by Congress to be its first governor. After this milestone towards statehood, Mormons began to gradually become more open about their involvement in polygamy. This sparked numerous anti-polygamy debates in Congress in the following years. Congressional Republicans soon began to compare polygamy to slavery and adopted the name ‚Äúthe twin relics of barbarism‚Äù at the 1856 Republican convention. In 1858 president James Buchanon sent federal troops to Salt Lake City and Brigham Young gave up his position as governor without a fight.  Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1860  In 1860, Republican representative Justin S. Morrill presented his anti-bigamy bill to Congress for the third time. The bill instituted punitive sentencing on those convicted of polygamy and enacted financial restrictions on the LDS church. After passing in both the House and Senate the bill was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on July 1, 1862. However, the bill was rarely and weakly enforced and in a matter of years, mostly forgotten.  Reynolds v. United States  George Reynolds was a Utah resident and member of the LDS Church. He was convicted on polygamy charges for having two wives and his defense claimed that his First Amendment right to freedom of religion had been violated. When the case came before the United States Supreme Court, Reynolds's conviction was upheld. It was decided that Congress maintained the ability to prohibit polygamy and the court concluded that a person is not excused from the law on religious grounds.  Edmunds Anti-polygamy Act of 1882  The Edmunds Anti-polygamy Act took further action against polygamy and members of the LDS Church. It made polygamy a felony and deemed bigamous cohabitation a misdemeanor. As a result of the bill, at least 1,300 Mormons were found guilty and imprisoned. Those who were found in violation were barred from jury duty, voting and possessing positions of public office. The Edmunds Act sent a clear message to the LDS Church that Congress was determined to put an end to the practice of polygamy.  House Bill 307  Utah State Capitol Building In 2003, House Bill 307 introduced a new child bigamy amendment. This new law proposed a specific definition of what child bigamy is and how it is viewed under the law. It stated that if a person above the age of 18 years were to marry or cohabitate with a person under the age of 18, they would be guilty of a second degree felony. This bill changed the criminal code by adding the second degree felony charge to the listed offenses. The 2008 House Bill 31 aimed to redefine child welfare laws and certain kinds of abuse. This bill included child bigamy under the term \\"sexual abuse\\". It placed child bigamy on the same level as incest, sexual battery, and lewdness involving a child. Child bigamy remains a form of sexual abuse today. Utah State Code indicates that any male or female under the age of 18 must receive signed consent of legal guardians, and a judge, after determining the legitimacy of the impending marriage, giving permission for that marriage to take place. In many polygamist communities men marry young girls in their teenage years and are often results of arranged marriages.  House Bill 99  Teenagers of polygamous families On May 5, 2017, House Bill 99 (HB99) became effective in Utah. The bill was a response to the Brown v Buhman case, filed by reality TV star Kody Brown from the TLC show Sister Wives. HB99 slightly changes the definition of bigamy and child-bigamy. HB99 deems the cohabitation of a man with multiple women whom he refers to as wives illegal, even in relationships between consenting adults. The bill also establishes a stronger emphasis on unlawful behavior within polygamist groups. Many polygamist communities across the state of Utah have been suspected of or exposed for committing a number of crimes such as domestic violence and child abuse. The bill aimed to implement harsher punishment towards polygamists who are also engaged in additional criminal activities such as domestic violence and child abuse. Bigamy is traditionally a third-degree felony, however, HB99 makes a modification, it states that when bigamy is accompanied by other charges such as domestic violence, fraud, child abuse, or sex trafficking it is classified as a second degree felony. HB99 was sponsored by Utah state senator Kevin T. Van Tassell (whose daughter is engaged in a plural marriage) and Utah state representative Michael E. Noel. After its passing in congress, the bill was signed by Utah Governor Gary Herbert on March 28, 2017. A short time before, polygamists and others who opposed the bill rallied at the Utah state capitol to protest the legislation on February 10, 2017. Many polygamists and polygamist supporters argued that the bills punitive approach was unconstitutional by targeting a specific religious minority. The bill further criminalizes their polygamist lifestyle and puts them at an even greater risk of being in trouble with the law.  Enforcement of anti- polygamy laws  In spite of the laws prohibiting polygamy, many members of the FLDS church and other religions continue to practice polygamy without restraint. While the government does not excuse polygamy because of the nature of the offense it is difficult to prosecute. Lack of prosecution of these polygamist is due to lack of evidence, lack of priority within law enforcement, lack of resources, and a potential influx of orphaned children. Many polygamists are able to legally practice their lifestyle by being legally married to one woman and performing spiritual marriage ceremonies with their other wives. This makes prosecuting very difficult. Community of Christ The Community of Christ (formerly the RLDS Church) has rejected the practice of polygamy since its inception and continues to affirm monogamy \\"as the basic principle of Christian marriage\\". Many Community of Christ adherents believed Joseph Smith never taught or practiced polygamy and that the doctrine began with the teachings of Brigham Young in the LDS Church.Times and Seasons 5:423 and 474.Millennial Star 4 (January 1844): 144. The Community of Christ does not recognize Smith's 1831 revelation or the 1843 revelation on polygamy as canonical, and some members regard them as inauthentic. Although some past leaders of the RLDS Church‚Äîmost notably Joseph Smith III and others who were descendants of Joseph Smith‚Äîhave strenuously denied that Smith taught or practiced polygamy, the Community of Christ today states that it \\"does not legislate or mandate positions on issues of history\\".\\"Community of Christ: Frequently Asked Questions\\". The church acknowledges that research into the early Latter Day Saint movement \\"seem[s] to increasingly point to Joseph Smith Jr. as a significant source for plural marriage teaching and practice\\", but the church argues that it must be recognized that Smith was not infallible in his teachings. Strangite Church Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) have historically taught and, in limited numbers, have practiced plural marriage. James Strang was married to several women during his leadership of the church. However, the Strangites reject the 1843 revelation on polygamy by Joseph Smith. The Book of the Law of the Lord, a part of the Strangite canon, sanctions polygamy, but the church reports that \\"there are no known cases of polygamy currently in the church\\". Mormon fundamentalist sects Over time, many who rejected the LDS Church's discontinuation of plural marriage formed small, close-knit communities in areas of the Rocky Mountains. These groups continue to practice what they refer to as \\"the principle\\", despite its illegality, and consider polygamy a requirement for entry into the highest heaven. Commonly called Mormon fundamentalists, they may practice as individuals, as families, or within organized denominations. Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints Members of the FLDS Church generally believe at least three wives are necessary for entrance to the highest heaven. Similarly, wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands. The FLDS Church currently practices the law of placing, whereby a young woman of sufficient age is assigned a husband by revelation through the leader of the FLDS Church, who is regarded as a prophet. The prophet may give wives to (and remove wives from) a man according to his worthiness. Apostolic United Brethren The AUB currently supports plural marriage, justified on the \\"1886 Meeting\\". While not all members practice plural marriage, it is considered a crucial step to achieve the highest glory of heaven. The leaders of the AUB do not arrange marriages, nor do they authorize marriage for people under 18, nor for those who are closely related. Table= Prominent figures and legal cases = Tom Green  Polygamist Tom Green was initially a member of the mainstream LDS church but was excommunicated when he adopted the practice of plural marriage. He resided in a makeshift trailer park in southern Utah with his large family who lived off the welfare system and a small income provided by selling magazine subscriptions. Those of Tom Green's wives who were not legally married to him would often file for welfare as single mothers to receive money. The Green Family came into the spotlight in 1999 when he told Dateline NBC that he had multiple wives during the making of a documentary. Green and his large family had begun to broadcast their lifestyle in the years prior. They appeared on talk shows (including the Jerry Springer Show) and in other documentaries explaining their unique familial situation. All of this media exposure sparked interest in Juab County Attorney David O. Leavitt to begin an investigation. In April 2000, Leavitt charged Green with bigamy, criminal non-support, and child rape. The main offense against Green was his marriage to Linda Kunz, who was 13 when the couple was married. After examining birth certificates, prosecutors discovered that Tom and Linda had conceived a child when she was only 13 years old. In June 2002 Green was sentenced to five years to life in prison. Tom Green is often credited with bringing the underground practice of polygamy back into the legal spotlight.  Warren Jeffs  Polygamist and FLDS prophet Warren Jeffs Warren Jeffs is the incarcerated leader of the Fundamentalist Latter-day Saints who was arrested in 2006 by a highway patrolman during a traffic stop in Nevada. Jeffs, the self-proclaimed prophet has a long history of arranging marriages among his followers in a suspicious manner, often creating unions between relatives and under-aged girls. Many of his actions were in direct violation of 2003 House Bill 307 outlining child bigamy laws. He was arrested on multiple accounts of being an accomplice to rape and forcing a 14 year old girl to marry her 19 year old cousin. The girl testified in court against Jeffs and in 2007, and he was sentenced to two terms of five years to life in prison. He was sentenced again in 2011 on two accounts of sexual assault involving his own child brides.  Brown v. Buhman  Polygamist Kody Brown and his four wives became infamous across the world when their TLC show \\"Sister Wives\\" aired in 2010. Because they made their lifestyle so public, they were forced to take residence in Nevada to avoid Utah law enforcement. It was their case, Brown v. Buhman that inspired House Bill 99.  Bronson v. Swensen  The Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas has given polygamists grounds to raise claims of unconstitutional policies regarding polygamy and bigamy. Lawrence v. Texas was not specifically fighting for marriage rights but as a result of the case the unconstitutionality of laws restricting sexual relationships were brought into question. In response to the Lawrence v. Texas case G. Lee Cook, his wife D. Cook, and desired wife J. Bronson, of Salt Lake City, Utah, filed a lawsuit in hopes to abolish restrictive laws against polygamy. Court cases against anti-polygamy laws argue that such laws are unconstitutional in regulating sexual intimacy, or religious freedom. In the case of Bronson v. Swensen the plaintiffs followed suit as they claimed violation of privacy, religious freedom, and restriction of sexual relationships. Following these claims polygamists began to not only rely on the first amendment for grounds of unconstitutionality, but also used the Fourteenth Amendment that gives all citizens equal protection of law.  Effects of current polygamy practice  A societal view on the purpose marriage and its variants determine the regulations and policies made. If marriage is viewed as means of reproduction only polygamy is accepted. If marriage is viewed as a means of compassion and individual fulfillment and satisfaction polygamy is rejected. Polygamous marriages by country Under U.S. law any person who wishes to immigrate to the U.S. but practices, or intends to practice, polygamy is denied entrance. Regardless of the legality of the plural marriage in the country of origin, the U.S. government will only recognize one marriage thus, a man with multiple wives can only sponsor one wife who wishes to immigrate to the U.S. If a man who practiced polygamy in his maternal country wishes to sponsor more than one wife he must divorce the wife in the U.S first. Any women who succeeds in avoiding the bar on polygamy is denied basic legal rights regarding marriage, divorce, and financial support. The denial of these rights \\"perpetuates the cycle of 'abuse and exploitation' that is sometimes synonymous with modern-day polygamy\\". Polygamy often puts extra, strenuous responsibilities on women. Many argue that polygamous relationships deny certain rights to women and degrade their value  See also  * Poland Act * Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act * Late Corp. of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v.

Northern Moravian witch trials, also known as Boblig witch trials was a series of witch trials which occurred in the Jesen√≠k and ≈†umperk area in present-day Czech Republic, between 1622 and 1696. They are among the largest and most well known witch trials in the history of the country.  Background  The Northern Moravian witch trials are considered to be part of the Catholic counter-reformation. The Bohemians were unwilling to abandon their Protestant religion after Bohemia had been taken by Austria during the Thirty Years' War. There was also great opposition to the social oppression of farmers under the landlords. This caused rebellions, such as the one of 1659-1662 led by Kry≈°tof Winter, Mikul√°≈° Patzold and Jan Jaschke. Jesuit priest Arnold Engel was the first person who had pointed out to the alleged witch practices in North Moravia. In order to draw attention of Emperor Leopold I, he wrote a special memorandum describing alleged public mocking of Catholics by Protestants. In his pamphlet, Engel refers also to the \\"flourishing of the art of witchcraft and evil\\". He notes, that \\"... so many dead men, who didn't die in good faith, but had connections with the devil, are getting up from their graves, and cause heavy damages to both the residents and their livestock.\\" Witch trials were otherwise uncommon in Bohemia and Moravia. The first witch trials occurred in Jesen√≠k in 1622, when 4 women were executed. In 1636, the first great hunt erupted and lasted until 1648; the number executed has been lost, but is considered to have been great. In 1651, 86 people were executed for witchcraft. 250 people are estimated to have been executed for this charge in the first period of 1622-1651\\\\. In 1667, another 16 were burned in Ratibor. They occurred mainly in present-day Silesia and the Principality of Nisa.  The trials  At Easter 1678, Marie Schuhov√° from Vern√≠≈ôovice attended church, and during the mass, she was observed taking the bread of communion from her mouth into her prayer book. This was the starting point of the witch trials. The local aristocrat, Countess Angelia Anna Sibyla of Galle, was advised to form a witch commission. Retired inquisition judge Jind≈ôich Franti≈°ek Boblig was recommended as the judge and head of the commission. Boblig was to become a well known witch hunter. The countess did not initially approve of torture. By displaying the torture devices for Schuhov√°, she pointed out the midwife Dorota Gr√∂rov√°, who, in her turn, pointed out Dorota Davidov√°, who had wanted the communion to use for a spell which would give the cows more milk. Boblig now convinced the countess that torture was necessary, and after this, torture was much used. The accused were stripped, the Devil's mark were searched for. In 1679, Marie Schuhov√° and three other women were burned at the stake; one, Davidov√°, had died in prison but her corpse was burned all the same. Boblig and his commission continued his work, and was rumored to be driven by economic reasons. He turned to the city ≈†umperk, where many wealthy families lived. Ka≈°par Sattler and his wife Marie were among those found guilty by him.  The trial of Lautner  In February 1680, five women were decapitated and burned. Usually, those convicted by Boblig were sentenced execution by burning. In Velk√© Losiny, Marie Sattlerov√° was pointed out by some of them. When four women were burned in September 1680, the crowd watching the execution cried for Jesus to forgive them. This made an impression on the priest Tom√°≈° K√∂nig. Together with other priests, he protested against Boblig, saying that if the commission were allowed to continue, then soon no one could be certain of their lives. Boblig reacted with gathering incriminating material against the critics which would suggest that they were witches as well. K√∂nig died in 1682, just avoiding an arrest, as Boblig was ready to present his witch charge against him. Another of the critics was Kry≈°tof Alois Lautner, vicar of ≈†umperk and a popular person because of his tolerance. The Sattler family belonged to the most known accused people of these trials. They had come into an argument with members of the commission. Boblig had long planned to have them accused so that he could confiscate their property. An already arrested person was made to implicate them. Ka≈°par Sattler, his wife Marie and daughter Lizl were arrested and tortured. They were made to implicate Zuzana Voglickov√°, the house keeper and mistress of Lautner. The accused were made to confess to have committed incest and sex with demons at the witches' sabbath. They implicated Lautner, who was arrested as well with permission from the bishop. Lautner, Voglickov√° and the Sattler family were burned at the stake in 1685. The persecutions continued for eighteen years, until the death of Boblig in 1696. About one hundred people are estimated to have been executed in the 1678-1696 witch craze.  In fiction  Otakar V√°vra's film Kladivo na ƒçarodƒõjnice (Malleus Maleficarum, also translated as Witches' Hammer or Witchhammer, 1969) is based on V√°clav Kaplick√Ω‚Äôs book Kladivo na ƒçarodƒõjnice (1963), a novel about witch trials in Northern Moravia during the 1670s.

It has approximately 3,000 seats, and a capacity of 7,000 including lawn seating of over 4,000. In June 2012, the venue was renamed the Pennysaver Amphitheater after being known as the Brookhaven Amphitheater for many years.  History  Though outdoor concerts have been held at Bald Hill since as far back as 1965, the current amphitheater was built in the late 1980s (replacing earlier portable and simpler stages) on the location of the former Bald Hill Ski Bowl, and modeled after venues such as the PNC Bank Arts Center in New Jersey. It has been compared to such arenas as the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. The venue does not share the same popularity as the Nikon at Jones Beach Theater also located on Long Island, however many concertgoers have praised the sight lines. Throughout the years the theater has hosted musical acts such as Blondie, James Brown, B.B. King, Pat Benatar, Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Twisted Sister and the 2002 Metal Edge Rockfest. The venue has also hosted family-friendly movie nights. The Town of Brookhaven's management of the facility has not always been smooth. One black mark occurred in the early 1990s, when a local promoter booked several high- profile shows that never happened, and failed to issue refunds, causing lawsuits to be brought against the town. Another venue manager was allegedly fired in 2002. From 2004‚Äì2008, the venue ran a deficit of more than $3.9 million. The Town planned to stop providing more funding in the fall of 2008, but later decided to host at least three shows in 2009. In 2012, the Brookhaven Town Board approved a five-year agreement with JVC Broadcasting to manage the venue, and in June 2012 it was announced that the facility would be renamed the Pennysaver Amphitheater at Bald Hill.(27 June 2012).

History It was inaugurated on September 29, 1955, by President Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. It remained open until the end of the 1970s. A series of fruitless attempts to reopen it in 1986, 1988, and 1990 each ended in closing it. In 2000, the national government gave a concession to the Inversora Tur√≠stica Caracas¬¥Company, which was to reopen the tramway to coincide with rebuilding the Humboldt Hotel and the Magic Park of Avila [Parque M√°gico Avila] (El Avila National Park). In 2000, the reconstruction of the cableway system began, as well as the one of the stations, and the cable cars are now operating. Nowadays there are more than 70 tram cars which can travel 3.5 km in 15 minutes approximately. The cost for a round trip ride is between 100 Bs (for Venezuelans) and 110 Bs (for non-Venezuelans). In August 2007, the concession was revoked and the park is once again in the hands of the federal government. In October 2007, it was renamed \\"Waraira Repano‚Äù.\\" However, the hotel project was not as successful (it was never rebuilt or reopened) and despite it being worked on for 13 years, the hotel remains a ruin. The park area at the top of the mountain is a wide walkway along the ridgeline. Several sellers have set up food or handicraft kiosks. There is also a restaurant and ice skating rink, an enormous Venezuelan flag waving in the breeze, and the ruins of the Humboldt Hotel. Often the top of the mountain has clouds drifting through it, obscuring the view. It is several degrees cooler than Caracas or the coast. When the clouds clear, the city of Caracas can be seen on one side and the coastline on the other side.  System  View from Avila The original system had four stations and two sections, the first one between the city of Caracas (altitude 1,000m), and the top of Avila hill (2,100m), that also took passengers down to the Humboldt Hotel and the second section left of the Avila that passed over the town of Galip√°n and finished in El Cojo station in Macuto, although the Vargas Station (Estado Vargas) fell into disuse and became obsolete. The operating company, before the concession was revoked, reconstructed all of the first section (Marip√©rez - √Åvila). The state then took control of the system and announced plans to modernize further the second section of the system; a task unfinished by the previous contractor because of the cancellation of that concession. At the beginning of 2008, the state put its plan into action and began the reconstruction of the second cableway system from Galip√°n to El Cojo, but to this day no construction has started on the site.

The film contains the voice talents of Jos√© Coronado, Juan Echanove and Imanol Arias in the original version and the voice acting of father-son actors Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez in the English dub. Summary A bright star guides Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar toward a treasure meant for the unborn King of Kings. To make the three wise men's quest even more difficult, King Herod's evil counselor, Belial, is among them in disguise, trying to sabotage their mission! Will they succeed in their righteous pursuit? Their fate depends on whether they learn to work together for the common good. Plot Jimmy, a boy disillusioned about Christmas, visit's his uncle Alfredo at his shop, who recounts the story of the Nativity Story in a different point of view. In ancient times, Herod the Great with his advisor Belial are searching for the Royal Treasures. Meanwhile, three powerful Magi ‚Äì Balthazar, Gaspar, and Melchior ‚Äì follow the Star of Bethlehem after its light shines upon them, hoping to find the King of Kings (Melchior hopes for it to lead him to a Valley of Gold). They cross paths in a small village, saving the villagers from bandits and rescue a young revolutionist Sarah, who joins them on their journey. Herod finds out about this and he and Belial arrange Tobias, son of late general Jason, to act as a spy. In Judea, the Magi visit Herod, the latter requesting have them return when they find the child so in secret he can kill him. One of his advisers, Baruch, reveals their destiny: they are to find the royal treasures consisting of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and bring them to newborn baby Jesus, warning them of Herod and Belial's scheme. They are chased by the palace guard. Tobias helps them escape and gets wounded. They are forced to let him come along as they head for the City of Salt along the Dead Sea. Belial has Tobias lure them to Black Crow Canyon, but the group manage to escape his spells. The group manage to get along during the journey, where Sarah and Tobias stumble upon a slavery mine. Sarah reveals that when she was young, Herod ordered all of the villagers and one of his generals executed because they offered slaves sanctuary. Before she could reveal the general's name, she is bitten by a scorpion and falls ill. The magi find the city and uncover the Temple of Ashta. Tobias turns his back on Herod when the general is revealed to be his father. Inside the temple, each magi is tested and finally given a treasure when they pass them. Herod's forces arrives as the moon blocks out the sun; however, the henchmen disintegrate and the temple conceals itself once the magi exit as the surviving soldiers flee. Belial transforms into a gigantic monster. Eventually, they are able to defeat him in the same manner King David defeated Goliath, destroying the enchanted moon and blinding Belial as he falls to his death. Herod gives them an ultimatum: the treasures or Baruch's life. Herod is soon defeated and Melchior punishes Herod with coal. In the end, they reach Bethlehem and offer the treasures to the newborn baby Jesus. Back in modern times, Jimmy received a visit from the Three Wise Men. He is given Aristobulus, Sarah's kangaroo rat. Home media The film was released on DVD on November 1, 2005.

After the war she was recommissioned for a short period with the Royal Canadian Navy before being sold to Turkey in 1957 and renamed Bartin. She served with the Turkish Naval Forces until 1972. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 167 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Kentville was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Kentville was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 180 The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Kentville had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. Kentville was armed with a single quick- firing (QF) 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun mounted forward.Macpherson (1997), p. 70 The ships were also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII aft and were eventually fitted with single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 58 Those ships assigned to convoy duty had two depth charge launchers and four chutes to deploy the 40 depth charges they carried. Service history Kentville was ordered as part of the 1941‚Äì42 programme of minesweeper production. The minesweeper's keel was laid down on 15 December 1941 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co at Port Arthur, Ontario. The ship was launched on 17 April 1942 and was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 10 October 1942 with pennant number J146 at Port Arthur.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 191 After escorting a coastal convoy en route to Halifax, Kentville was assigned to Halifax Force in January 1943 after working up. She spent the majority of her war service working out of Halifax. In May 1943 she was assigned to Sydney Force, working out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. Her duties involved escorting coastal convoys in Atlantic Canada. She remained with the group until November 1943, when she transferred back to Halifax. During the course of her duties, she rescued the freighter Imperial Monarch in distress from heavy weather and the tugboat Foundation Franklin. In May 1944, Kentville underwent a refit at Charlottetown, completing in July and working up in Bermuda until August. She returned to Halifax following workups and resumed her duties. Kentville saw enemy action in January 1945 when she defended her convoy against submarine attacks which sank two merchant ships. During the war her crew often took leave in her namesake town of Kentville.Sanford, p. 43 On 14 January 1945 she picked up five survivors from the freighter Polarland, which had been sunk by .

It is a part of the eastern gas route from Siberia to China. The proposed western gas route to China is known as Power of Siberia 2 (Altai gas pipeline). History In 2007, the Ministry of Industry and Energy of Russia approved the Eastern Gas Program, which included construction of the Yakutia‚ÄìKhabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok pipeline. On 29 October 2012, Russian president Vladimir Putin instructed Alexey Miller, CEO of Gazprom to start the construction of the pipeline. The Yakutia‚ÄìKhabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok pipeline project was officially renamed Power of Siberia at the end of 2012. On 21 May 2014, Russia and China signed a 30-year gas deal worth $400 billion which was needed to make the project feasible. Construction was launched on 1 September 2014 in Yakutsk by Putin and Chinese deputy prime minister Zhang Gaoli. Construction of the connecting pipeline in China started on 29 June 2015. On 4 September 2016, Miller and China National Petroleum Corporation's Chairman Wang Yilin signed an agreement to build a crossing under the Amur River for the pipeline. Two tunnels under the river were completed by China Petroleum Pipeline in March 2019. In 2017, construction of the Atamanskaya (Zeyskaya) compressor station began. The Atamanskaya and Chayandinskaya compressor stations were completed in 2019. Construction of all compressor stations is scheduled to be completed by 2022. The pipeline was filled with gas in October 2019. Deliveries to China started on 2 December 2019. Technical description Together with the development of the Chayanda field and the Amur Gas Processing Plant, the whole Power of Siberia project was expected to cost US$55‚Äì70 billion. , the pipeline was estimated to cost 1.1 trillion roubles, the development of the Chayanda field was estimated to cost 450 billion roubles, and the Amur Gas Processing Plant was estimated to cost 950 billion roubles. The total length of the pipeline, when fully completed, will be . The full capacity of the pipeline would be up to per annum of natural gas, of which per annum are supplied to China. The export to China starts with per annum in 2020, and is expected to increase gradually to per annum by 2025. The pipeline's working pressure is ensured by nine compressor stations with a total capacity of 1,200 MW. The working pressure between the Chayanda field and the Atamanskaya compressor station is , and between the Atamanskaya compressor station and the border of China is . The Chayandinskaya compressor station has capacity of 577 MW and the Atamanskaya compressor station has capacity of 128 MW. The remaining seven compressor stations‚ÄîSaldykelskaya, Olyokminskaya, Amginskaya, Nimnyrkaya , Nagornaya, Skovorodinskaya, and Sivakiskaya ‚Äîhave a total capacity of 481 MW. The pipeline is able to withstand temperatures as low as . It has a nanocomposite coating to increase the lifetime of the pipeline. To withstand earthquakes, the pipeline uses materials that will deform under seismic activity. Internal coatings ensure energy efficiency by reducing the friction of the pipeline's inner surfaces. The mass of all the pipes used to construct the pipeline is more than 2.25 million tonnes (2.5 million tons). According to the study published by the Cambridge University Press, the pipeline seems to avoid technical and legal standards applied to similar pipelines from Russia to Europe because of lower requirements in both Russia and China. Route The pipeline is fed from the Chayanda field in Yakutia , which was launched in 2019. The Kovykta field in Irkutsk Oblast will start to supply to the pipeline in 2023. The first phase of the pipeline starts at the Chayanda field in Yakutia. It runs, partly within the same corridor as the Eastern Siberia‚ÄìPacific Ocean oil pipeline , through Lensk, Olyokminsk, Aldan, Neryungri, Skovorodino, and Svobodny , where the pipeline is connected to the Amur Gas Processing Plant. From there, the pipeline branches south to Blagoveshchensk on the Russia‚ÄìChina border. By the two tunnels under the Amur River, it is connected to the Heihe‚ÄìShanghai pipeline in China. Together they form the eastern route for gas supplies from Siberia to China. The second phase of the pipeline connects the Kovykta field to the Chayanda field. According to the original plan, the further extension of the Power of Siberia pipeline will continue from Svobodny through Birobidzhan to Khabarovsk where the pipeline will be linked with the Sakhalin‚ÄìKhabarovsk‚ÄìVladivostok pipeline.Gazprom map of gas pipelines in Siberia, planned and projected retrieved 2012-11-26 Gazprom has not published if and when this extension will be built. Contractors Gazprom Transgaz Tomsk was the main construction contractor, while VNIPIgazdobycha, both subsidiaries of Gazprom, was the general design contractor. Different sections of the pipeline were built by Stroytransgaz owned by Gennady Timchenko, Neftegazstroy, and Stroygazmontazh owned by Arkady Rotenberg. Pipes were manufactured by the Vyksa Steel Works of OMK, the Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling Plant, the Izhora Pipe Mill of Severstal, the Volzhsky Pipe Plant of TMK, Zagorsk Pipe Plant, and Pipe Innovative Technologies. Anti-corrosion nanocomposite coating of pipes was done by Metaclay, a joint venture of Rusnano and Gazprom. Compressor turbine units were supplied by UEC-Perm Engines.  Impact  The pipeline has strong implications for energy security in both China and Russia in the short term. The pipeline diversifies natural gas supplies for China. It is designed to reduce China's dependence on coal, which is more carbon intensive and causes more pollution than natural gas. For Russia, the pipeline allows another economic partnership in the face of resistance to pipelines being built in Western Europe.

He has written on the advantages of free market economics for the Wall Street Journal and the Jerusalem Post. He translated The Catcher in the Rye and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man into Hebrew.ICSEP: About the director  Biography  Daniel Doron is a third-generation sabra. His grandfather, Zerah Barnett, was one of the first Jewish pioneers in Palestine. Doron served Air Force Intelligence during the Israeli War of Independence in 1948, and studied sociology and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the 1960s, Daniel Doron resumed his studies as a Fellow of the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought, and then with Lionel Trilling and Jacques Barzuz as a Visiting Scholar at Columbia University. His exposure to economist Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek and other free market intellectual forces at the University of Chicago greatly influenced him. Later, the philosophies Doron acquired in the United States would lead him to push for free market changes in Israel's anti-competitive, socialist society and economy.  Public service career  He served under Teddy Kollek, then director-general of the Prime Minister's Office. In 1957, Doron was delegated by the Prime Minister's Office to serve as special consultant to the US Embassy in Tel Aviv. He also served on an economic advisory group for Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and on the Israel Government Council for National and Economic Planning, was a member of the board of the Entrepreneurial Center of Tel Aviv University, and is a member of the Mont-Pelerin Society. Doron was among the founders of The Herzliyah Conference, served on its steering committee and initiated its economic segment.  Political activism  Since 1973, Doron has been involved in political and economic reform in Israel. He helped to found the Shinui political party which succeeded in gaining a foothold in the Israeli Knesset. In 1983, Doron founded the Israel Center for Social and Economic Progress (ICSEP), a non-profit organization that seeks to increase the competitiveness of the Israeli economy. ICSEP conducts seminars for top Israeli university students to study free market economics, and employs respected Israeli economic thinkers to examine Israeli markets in search of anti-competitive inefficiencies. ICSEP recommended that Israeli banks be barred from the Israeli capital markets. The Israeli Knesset later passed the Bachar Reforms codifying Daniel Doron's recommendations.  Art career  Doron was sole representative of the artist Shalom of Safed, arranging 15 museum exhibitions. Doron's film on Shalom won important awards and was represented in the US at international festivals.

A statue of Thomas Burke by John Francis Kavanagh is in Galway by Nimmo's Pier. Father Burke's statue, Galway, by John F Kavanagh Life His parents, though in moderate circumstances, gave him a good education. He studied at first under the care of the Patrician Brothers, and was afterwards sent to a private school. An attack of typhoid fever when he was fourteen years old, and the famine year of 1847 had a sobering effect. Toward the end of that year he asked to be received into the Order of Preachers, and was sent to Perugia in Italy, to make his novitiate. On 29 December, he was clothed there in the habit of St. Dominic and received the name of Thomas. Shortly afterward he was sent to Rome to begin his studies College of St. Thomas in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. Burke was a student of philosophy and theology at the College of St. Thomas in 1848. He passed thence to the Roman convent of Santa Sabina. His superiors sent him, while yet a student, as novice-master to Woodchester, the novitiate of the resuscitated English Province. He was ordained priest 26 March 1853. On 3 August 1854, defended publicly the theses in univers√¢ theologi√¢. Burke was made lector at the College of St. Thomas in 1854. Early in the following year Father Burke was recalled to Ireland to found the novitiate of the Irish Province at Tallaght, near Dublin. In 1859 he preached his first notable sermon on \\"Church Music\\"; it immediately lifted him into fame. Elected Prior of Tallaght in 1863, he went to Rome the following year as Rector of the Dominican Convent of San Clemente, and attracted great attention by his preaching. He returned to Ireland in 1867, and delivered his oration on Daniel O'Connell at Glasnevin before fifty thousand people. Bishop Leahy took him as his theologian to the First Vatican Council in 1870, and the following year he was sent as Visitor to the Dominican convents in America. He was besieged with invitations to preach and lecture. The seats were filled hours before he appeared, and his audiences overflowed the churches and halls in which he lectured. In New York he delivered the discourses in refutation of the English historian James Froude. In eighteen months he gave four hundred lectures, exclusive of sermons, the proceeds amounting to nearly $400,000. His mission was a triumph, but the triumph was dearly won, and when he arrived in Ireland on 7 March 1873, he was spent and broken. During the next decade he preached in Ireland, England, and Scotland. He began the erection of the church in Tallaght in 1883, and the following May preached a series of sermons in the new Dominican church, London. In June he returned to Tallaght in a dying condition, and preached his last sermon in the Jesuit church, Dublin, in aid of the starving children of Donegal. A few days afterwards he died. He is buried in the church of Tallaght, now a memorial to him. Works Many of his lectures and sermons were collected and published in various editions in New York, as were also the four lectures in reply to Froude (1872) the latter with the title \\"The Case of Ireland Stated\\". * The Sermons, Lectures, and Addresses (1872) * English Misrule in Ireland (1873) * Ireland's Case Wtated: In Reply to Mr. Froude (1873) See also * Dominicans in Ireland  Notes  ;Attribution *; The entry cites: **FitzPatrick, Life of Fr.

He is known for his work on kitsch.  Biography  Abraham studied electrical and acoustics engineering at the University of Grenoble while preparing a bachelor in sciences of nature. He became a research assistant at the Laboratory of metal physics, under the direction of F√©lix Esclangon, then of Louis N√©el. There he learned techniques of metal work, then electric and electronic tools. He wrote reports on material properties or technical analysis. At the end of the Second World War, he was hired by the French National Centre for Scientific Research in the Laboratory of acoustics and vibrations of Marseille, and at the CRSIM (Centre de recherche scientifique industriel et maritime). In 1952, he obtained a PhD in physics for a thesis titled 'La structure physique du signal musical et phon√©tique' (under the direction of Ren√© Lucas, Edmond Bauer, Henri Pieron and the physiologist Alexandre Monnier). He then participated to the works of the Centre d‚Äô√©tudes de la radio-t√©l√©vision (directed by Jean Tardieu), and was a member of Pierre Schaeffer's team. But due to his financial precarity, he accepted two grants of the Rockefeller Foundation, in order to work at Columbia University (Music Department headed by Vladimir Ussachevsky). In 1954, he defended a second PhD, in philosophy, under the title \\"La cr√©ation scientifique\\", under the direction of Bachelard. From 1954 to 1960, Abraham Moles was the director of the Laboratoire d‚Äô√©lectroacoustique Scherchen, in Gravesano, Switzerland. It was directed by Hermann Scherchen, one of the pioneers of Radio Berlin, who had discovered composers as famous as Luciano Berio, Iannis Xenakis, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono. At the same time, Abraham Moles was teaching at the University of Stuttgart (with Max Bense), of Bonn, of Berlin and of Utrecht. He was finally appointed as a full professor at the Ulm School of Design. After 1966, he taught in Strasbourg (in the department created by Henri Lefebvre), first in sociology, then in social psychology. He created there an Institute for social psychology of communications, usually called √âcole de Strasbourg. He developed an article \\"Art et ordinateur\\" (1970) into the book Art et ordinateur (1971). transposing the theories of Shannon to aesthetics.

He is the son of Ian Messiter, the creator of the BBC panel show Just a Minute, and his wife Enid (n√©e Senior).  Education  Messiter began playing the oboe at the age of 15 whilst a student at Bryanston School in Blandford Forum, Dorset. His first oboe teacher was Douglas Heffer, who taught both the oboe and English at Bryanston. Messiter was extremely enthusiastic from the onset and was known to play chamber music concerts at the school almost every week. When first beginning the oboe, Heffer bought him an oboe, the cost of which was put on the school bill, much to the surprise of his parents. In 1967, after studying the oboe for only two years, Messiter won a scholarship to the Paris Conservatoire. Messiter studied in Paris with Pierre Pierl√¥t, before returning to London in 1969 to study with Sidney Sutcliffe at the Royal College of Music. Whilst there, he won the Joy Boughton, the Grade 5 and the R.A.O.S. Prizes as well as a Performers' A.R.C.M. with Honours. Messiter has recorded with the National Philharmonic Orchestra, the Guildhall String Ensemble and the London Festival Orchestra. He was featured soloist for the theme to BBC TV‚Äôs The Secret Garden (1975), and his oboe playing features prominently in the song Twist in My Sobriety by Tanita Tikaram.

In 1924 he founded and edited the short-lived Mexican avant-garde cultural magazine Antena. In 1925 he famously deciphered a letter that conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s left written in code. He wrote, in addition to plays and poetry, various novels set in colonial Mexico, a genre known as colonialista. In 1930 he created in conjunction with Alejandro G√≥mez Arias, the department of Mexican and Hispano-American Literature at the National Preparatory School. He was a founding member in 1938 of the Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Cr√≠ticos de Teatro (AMCT). He belonged to the \\"grupo de los siete autores\\" (group of seven authors), a circle of dramatists active in the 1950s who revived the theatrical arts in Mexico. He was an admirer of Jos√© Juan Tablada and an imitator of the latter's haiku-inspired poetry (a style at the time referred to as haikai). He held important posts in the Ministry of Public Education. He was from 1922-65 a professor of Spanish and Latin- American literature at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM), his alma mater (M.A. 1941, Ph.D. 1942). He served as subdirector of the Biblioteca Nacional de M√©xico; as head librarian of the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (1931); and as director of the Imprenta Universitaria de la UNAM (UNAM University Press).

Pier Bandstand Weymouth is an Art Deco bandstand on the shore of Weymouth Bay in Dorset, England. History Weymouth Beach in 1983, with the Pier Bandstand seen jutting out into the bay. The Pier Bandstand was built in 1938-39 for a cost of ¬£35,000, to the designs of V.J. Wenning, who had won the architectural competition for the bandstand's design. Wenning's plans were one of twenty-six entries considered. The builder, Christiani Neilson, employed local labour on the construction work, which began in January 1938. The bandstand was officially opened on 25 May 1939 by J.T. Goddard, the Mayor of Weymouth. Overall, of concrete, of steel, of electrical conduit, of neon tubing and 1,200 light bulbs were used during the course of construction. The Pier Bandstand was designed with the bandstand extending out seaward from a two-storey building adjoining the promenade. The seaward section was able to seat 2,400 people, however only 800 of these seats were sheltered as the centre of the bandstand was roofless. Though the Pier Bandstand had gained some criticism for its intruding visual impact along the bay, it quickly became a popular attraction and was used to host many events from dances, concerts, wrestling, roller skating to the Miss Weymouth Bathing Beauty Contests. During the 1960s, the bandstand's promenade building was redesigned. It went on to house an amusement arcade and restaurant. By the 1980s, the seaward end of the bandstand was in need of major repair to maintain the stability of the structure. With Weymouth & Portland Borough Council facing ¬£300,000 in repair costs, the cheaper alternative of demolishing the bandstand was approved for a cost of ¬£30,000. A national competition was launched to find the individual who would 'press the button' to demolish it, which was won by two schoolgirls from Birmingham. The bandstand was demolished on 4 May 1986, which drew a large crowd of spectators. As a result the structure is deemed to be a \\"lost\\" pier by some noted authorities The work left only the landward building standing, which was later refurbished. The Sea Palace Chinese Restaurant was officially opened in the building in July 2002. Today, the Pier Bandstand houses the Italian restaurant Al Molo, along with an amusement arcade and gift shop within its ground level kiosks. Redevelopment plans As part of the regeneration of Weymouth and Portland, it was decided in 2007 that Weymouth's Esplanade would be redeveloped in time for the 2012 Olympic Games. The scheme included plans for the restoration and extension of the bandstand, while the exterior Art Deco features and symmetry would be restored. In addition, the area in front of the bandstand was to be redesigned into a 1930s-styled square, acting as the northern gateway to Weymouth Esplanade. However, the plans collapsed after the South West Regional Development Agency withdrew its ¬£6.6 million funding in 2009.

He was the first GRU officer to offer his services to the Central Intelligence Agency after World War II. Between 1953 and 1958, he provided the United States government with large amounts of information concerning military capabilities and espionage operations. Codenamed ATTIC,Jeffery T.

CIA Asset Pyotr Popov Arrested In 1953 Popov was a GRU officer stationed in Vienna, a case officer working against Yugoslav targets. Popov first made contact in 1953 by slipping a letter into the parked car of a United States diplomat in Vienna, offering to sell Soviet documents. He seemed to be motivated by a deep anger at what he felt was government exploitation of the peasants of Russia, including his own family.Phillip Taubman, New York Times, 23 May 1982, THE USES OF TRADECRAFT Whilst stationed in Vienna, Popov was able to provide documents such as the 1951 Soviet army field regulations, and after a July 1954 home visit to the Soviet Union, information regarding Soviet nuclear submarines and guided missiles. In 1955 Popov was suddenly transferred to East Berlin to work with illegal agents being sent to the West. He continued to provide counterintelligence and military information. In April 1958 Popov told Kisevalter that a senior KGB official had boasted of having \\"full technical details\\" of the Lockheed U-2 spy plane, leading U2 project director Richard M. Bissell, Jr. to conclude the project had a leak. On 1 May 1960 a U-2 was shot down over the Soviet Union, in the 1960 U-2 incident.Nigel West (2007), Historical Dictionary of Cold War Counterintelligence, Scarecrow Press, p350 Popov was dismissed from the GRU in November 1958, and placed on reserve status. In January 1959, after incriminating evidence was found in his apartment, he was run as a double agent for three months. He was then arrested in October 1959, and sentenced to death in January 1960.John L. Hart (1997), \\"Pyotr Semyonovich Popov: The tribulations of faith\\", Intelligence and National Security, Vol. 12, Iss. 4, 1997; included in Hart's The CIA's Russians (2003), here It was never proven how he was exposed, but one possibility is that US surveillance in October 1957 of one of Popov's agents led to suspicion falling on him. Reportedly, Margarita Nikolievska Tairov,Hood, William.

(Certainly, her entirely innocuous behavior, and her husband's, including their abrupt disappearance, suggest they suspected something was amiss.)Hood, pp.221-6 & 235-7. She reported this, and the matter was heavily investigated by Moscow. The investigation pointed to Popov, who had been the woman's control officer in East Berlin. He may also have been exposed by British double agent George Blake, who inadvertently learned the CIA was using a senior Soviet intelligence officer stationed in East Germany as a mole.Hood, pp.246-7. Other sources indicate a coded letter to Popov, sent by the CIA and intercepted by the KGB, led to his arrest (this may be a misunderstanding - Popov passed a letter to British intelligence, of which Blake became awareHood, p.246-7.). More recent evidence suggests Popov was already under suspicion prior to the Tairov incident, due to a leak of a private speech by Marshal Zhukov at which Popov was present. Popov was executed by Soviet authorities in 1960. Former CIA Soviet Russia counterintelligence officer Tennent H. Bagley believed Popov was not detected by Soviet surveillance, but was betrayed by fired American Embassy-in-Moscow CIA security officer, Edward Ellis Smith, in Washington, D.C.Bagley, Tennent H.

It is located less than a kilometer from the village of Kemmel, part of the municipality of Heuvelland in West Flanders. History The earliest settlements on the Kemmelberg date back 2.500 years, when Celtic tribes of the Hallstatt culture populated the area. The hill takes its name from Camulos, the Celtic god of war. Bodies on the Kemmelberg in April 1918 During World War I, it was the location of one of the war's most ferocious battles. Because of its strategic importance, it was fiercely fought in the Fourth Battle of Ypres. On 25 April 1918, German imperial forces, hoping to force a breakthrough to the North Sea, started attacking the French troops on the Kemmelberg with gas grenades. At 6 a.m. the German Alpenkorps seized and captured the Kemmelberg, causing allied troops to withdraw from all the hills in the region. Thousands of French soldiers were slaughtered. Several streets and army barracks in Germany were named after this event (Kemmel-Privatweg in Magdeburg, Kemmelkaserne in Murnau). Friedrich Bertram Sixt von Armin and Prince Franz of Bavaria were commanders, but Karl H√∂fer was celebrated as hero of Kemmelberg - the Held vom Kemmelberge.Andreas Dornheim: R√∂hms Mann f√ºrs Ausland It was recaptured during the Battle of the Peaks of Flanders in late September 1918, as a precursor to the Armistice of 11 November 1918. At the western foot of the hill, there is a large war cemetery, the Kemmel Number 1 French Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, with the remains of more than 5.000 French soldiers. At the top of the Kemmelberg there is a commemorative war memorial, the Monument aux soldats fran√ßais, constructed in 1932 and inaugurated by French general and war hero Lacappelle. The memorial column is 17 meter high and depicts the Roman victory goddess Victoria. In the area, the monument is colloquially called \\"The Angel\\". A NATO air defence command centre was based in an underground bunker on the southern edge of the hill in the 1950s. This now operates as a visitors centre. http://toerisme.heuvelland.be/tourism/845-www/218-www/11204-www.html Cycling The steep cobbled roads over the hill frequently feature in cycling races, especially in the Flemish spring classics. The climb is often a decisive location in Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, but is also regularly included in the Four Days of Dunkirk, the Three Days of De Panne, Three Days of West Flanders and the Tour de l'Eurom√©tropole. In 1950 the Kemmelberg was included in the route of the World Championship, won by Belgian local and cycling icon Briek Schotte.

The book spans all of Thomas's life to the present, beginning with his early childhood in the Deep South and his mother's decision to send him and his brother to be raised by her father and stepmother as she felt unable to care for them. He tells of his upbringing by his grandparents, his time in college and law school, and his career in government. Particular attention is focused on his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. The memoir discusses Thomas's emotional distress over divorcing his first wife, his intellectual evolution to conservatism, and the financial troubles that plagued him up through the late 1980s. It also includes a confession about his previously unknown struggle with alcohol. My Grandfather's Son was praised for its frank tone and well-written style. However, it was also criticized as being too partisan for a sitting Supreme Court Justice and for over-emphasizing claims of victimhood. Much of the media attention centered on his chapters on the confirmation hearings, one of which was titled \\"Invitation to a Lynching.\\" Thomas received a $1.5 million advance for the book, which hit number one on the New York Times non-fiction best- seller list. Summary Thomas describes his life chronologically in My Grandfather's Son. The early parts of the book are dominated by the impact his grandfather had on him, while sections describing his adulthood up to his Supreme Court appointment focus on overcoming personal demons without describing too much about his career. Following his confirmation to the Court, Thomas centers his writing on professional, ideological and judicial issues. The themes of race and self-reliance run throughout, and many issues are framed through one or both of those lenses. Early life and education My Grandfather's Son begins with Thomas's birth, in rural Georgia in 1948, to Leola Anderson, a maid who earned $10 a week. Thomas's father abandoned the family when Thomas was a toddler. In first grade his mother sent him and his brother to live with his maternal grandfather, Myers Anderson, and his wife in Savannah. Anderson, who Thomas and his brother came to call \\"Daddy\\", ran a small fuel oil business and kept a strict household. Thomas struggled with racism and segregation throughout his childhood. He attended all black schools until the 10th grade, when Anderson paid for Thomas to attend a Catholic boarding school. Thomas, who had been an altar boy throughout his childhood, wanted to be a priest and was one of only two black students at the school. Upon graduating, he began studying to be a priest, but gave up at the age of 19 because he was disappointed with the church's stance on racism. As a result of Thomas dropping out of school, his grandfather kicked him from the house. Thomas moved to Massachusetts to attend The College of the Holy Cross. One of his reasons for moving was the racism he had encountered as a child, and his belief that in the North he would be freed from that. Once there, he found Massachusetts to be plagued with latent racism and far from the utopia he had anticipated. Thomas excelled academically and socially at Holy Cross, graduating with honors and marrying his long-term girlfriend Kathy Ambush shortly after. He also began drinking steadily, a problem that would haunt him in later years. Thomas attended Yale Law School, graduating in 1974. Early career left After Yale, Thomas took a job as an assistant district attorney under John Danforth, then Missouri's Attorney General. My Grandfather's Son continues to follow Thomas's career, including a stint at the legal department of Monsanto Company and his 1979 move to Washington, D.C. to work for then- Senator Danforth. Throughout this period Thomas made an intellectual journey from libertarian to conservative, culminating in changing his party registration to Republican in 1980. In 1981 he joined the Reagan Administration's Department of Education as its Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office of Civil Rights, and in 1982 he was promoted to head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The main focus, however, is on Thomas's financial and emotional struggles. Although he says he was never an alcoholic, Thomas says that in the late 1970s and early 1980s his drinking became worse, and that he often drank while home alone. These confessions were the first time there had been any public suggestion that Thomas was a heavy drinker. Burdened by student loans and subsisting on low government salaries, Thomas had a difficult time financially, almost getting evicted from his apartment several times. In one incident, a car rental agent cut up Thomas's credit card in front of him. After falling out of love with his first wife, Thomas worried about the morality of leaving her and his child. Throughout most of this period Thomas was still estranged from his grandfather, and describes being haunted by the memory of Anderson kicking him out of the house. The two reunited briefly in 1983 when his step-grandmother was in the hospital, having a meaningful conversation and embracing at the end. The newfound closeness was short-lived, and Anderson died the next month of a stroke before Thomas had another chance to see him. Around this point, Thomas describes himself regaining control of his life. In 1983, he quit drinking cold-turkey. In 1984, Thomas divorced his first wife; however his son moved in with him, which calmed Thomas's fears of abandoning his child as his father had left him. In 1987, he married his second wife, Virginia Lamp, with their marriage effectively ending his financial woes. In 1989, Thomas became a judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Supreme Court confirmation and term Approximately a third of My Grandfather's Son is spent discussing Thomas's nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court. Thomas says he was initially reluctant to become a Justice, but that when President George H. W. Bush asked him he felt obliged to accept. When the hearings began on September 1, 1991, Thomas expected them to center on race and claims to have had no advance information about Anita Hill's accusations. My Grandfather's Son goes through the hearings day by day, with Thomas defending himself against his accusers and criticizing their motives. Thomas says he learned of the accusations of sexual harassment by Hill over the weekend after the first five days of the hearings when a pair of FBI agents visited his home. Critical reception William Grimes, in his book review for The New York Times, describes Thomas' writing of his time at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under President Ronald Reagan (which, Grimes writes, made him an 'object of contempt and derision for mainstream civil rights organizations\\") as \\"adopting a defensive crouch, lashing out at his enemies, reopening old wounds and itemizing insults that should be forgotten.\\" Grimes describes Thomas' treatment of the Anita Hill affair as a portrayal of \\"himself as a persecuted, almost Christlike figure singled out by the liberal establishment, at the behest of his civil rights enemies, not just for criticism but also for total annihilation.\\" References Category:African- American autobiographies Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:Books written by Justices of the United States Supreme Court Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"My Grandfather's Son"},{"id":"18692876","text":"Deaconess Hospital is a hospital in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma that is affiliated with Community Health Systems.

It was located 40 stadia away from the sea at the west end of Mount Minthi and built around two citadels (one at Agios Dimitrios, one at Phyrcus). Surrounded by an abundance of natural resources, Lepreum became an important city in the Classical and Hellenistic ages where it became the capital of the Triphylia region. The city has also been identified by some scholars as the mythical city of Aepy, a city described by Homer in the Iliad but never discovered.Hellenic Ministry of Culture archaeological report The ruins of ancient Lepreum have been excavated near the present village Lepreo.  Mythology and Proto-History  Lepreon was the chief town of Triphylia, which is said to have been originally inhabited by the Caucones, whence Lepreon is called by Callimachus \\"fortified city of the Caukones\\".Call. Jov. 39. The Caucones were afterwards expelled by the Minyans, who founded Lepreon, which one of six cities (along with Makistos, Phrixa, Purgoi, Epeion, and Noudion) founded by the Minyans in the territory of the Caucones.  History  The ruins of the temple of Demeter. The earliest traces of habitation in the area are from the Neolithic, with the inhabitants exploiting the area's natural resources and evidence of ties with the Aegean civilizations. It was the site of a grove sacred to Dione ( Di·πìnƒì, from earlier Diw≈çnƒÅ \\"she of Dyeus\\"). Shortly after the establishment of the city and following the First Messenian War, Lepreon and the rest of the Triphylia region were subdued by the Eleians, who governed them as subject places. The Triphylian cities, however, always bore this yoke with impatience; and Lepreum took the lead in their frequent attempts to shake off the Eleian supremacy. The greater importance of Lepreum is shown by the fact that it was the only one of the Triphylian towns which took part in the Greco-Persian Wars. In 421 BC, Lepreum and the other cities of Triphylia revolted against the Eleians with the assistance of Sparta, with the Eleians accepting Triphylian independence in 400 BC. With the weakening of Spartan power by their loss at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC the Spartans attempted to gain supremacy over Tryphilia, who responded by joining the recently established Arcadian League for defence. et seq. Hence, Lepreum is called an Arcadian town by Pliny the Elder, and Pausanias states the townsfolk claimed to be Arcadians in his time, though he notes that they had been subject to Eleians from ancient times and that Aristophanes described the town as Eleian. During the Classical and Hellenistic ages Lepreum became the leading city of the Triphylia region, and was called a \\"blessed country\\" by Strabo; It controlled an area of high fertility, had both a good defensive position and mild climate thanks to the surrounding mountains and had easy access to both the Neda River and the sea. Due to its position in control of the roads linking Elis with Arcadia and Messenia, Lepreum was the de facto capital of Triphylia and was the only city in Triphylia to send troops to the Battle of Plataea during the Greco-Persian Wars. A temple dedicated to Demeter was built during the classical period in the Acropolis and parts of it still stand today. After the time of Alexander the Great, the Eleians again reduced the Triphylian cities, which therefore were obliged to join the Aetolian League along with the Eleians. But when Philip V of Macedon, in his war with the Aetolians, marched into Triphylia, the inhabitants of Lepreum rose against the Eleian garrison in their town, and declared in favour of Philip, who thus obtained possession of the place. By 170 AD, when visited by Pausanias, the city had lost much of its power and influence, although it was still considered the capital of Triphylia. The city was finally abandoned between 800 and 1000 after a series of raids by pirates and barbarians. Olympian raid The ancient Greek Olympics were a time of inter-city sporting competition, and as such an Olympic truce was maintained in which, during the Olympic games, any attacks by participant cities on other participant cities were forbidden. At one set of games, however, the fortress at Phyrcus was attacked by Spartan forces, who were subsequently fined 200,000 drachmas, a heavy fine in a period where the average wage of a skilled worker was 1 drachma a day.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 3.17.4. Architectural style The early buildings in the city were built on a foundation of limestone and porous bedrock, with walls of mud bricks. The buildings were orientated on a north-south line, with doors on the north side to avoid the strong south winds. Founding myths Lepreus, son of Pyrgeus (who was killed by Heracles) is considered by some to be the city's mythical founder, similar to the founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus. Other historians however assert that the city's name comes from the fact that the original settlers were afflicted with leprosy, while some claim that it was due to the presence of a temple of Zeus Leukaios (Of the White Poplar).Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 5. 3 - 5  See also  * List of ancient Greek cities References Category:Greek city-states Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Populated places in ancient Elis Category:Cities in ancient Peloponnese Category:Archaeological sites in Greece Category:Neolithic sites in Greece Category:Triphylia ","title":"Lepreum"},{"id":"18692979","text":"√Årnason (also Anglicised as Arnason) is a surname of Icelandic origin, meaning son of √Årni.

Background and early years Charles of Arenberg was the eldest son of Jean de Ligne and Margaretha von der Mark, countess of Arenberg. As his mother was the sister and sole heiress of Robert III von der Marck-Arenberg, the marriage contract of his parents stipulated that he would bear the title, name and arms of Arenberg.Derez a.o. (2002) p. 151. On 5 March 1576, Emperor Maximilian II raised his mother and her heirs to the rank of Princely Counts, thereby promoting them to the Council of Princes of the Imperial Diet.d'Arenberg (1951) pp.3-45. Apart from the immediate princely county of Arenberg, the family owned extensive properties in the duchy of Brabant (the lordships of Vorselaar, Loenhout and Humbeek), the duchy of Luxembourg (the lordship of Mirwart and half of Neufch√¢teau) and the county of Holland (the barony of Zevenbergen and the lordships of Terschelling and Naaldwijk).Derez (2002) pp. 153‚Äì193. At the age of ten, Charles of Arenberg was sent to the court of Albert V of Bavaria, where he would remain for three years. In 1566 he set out on a grand tour, visiting Paris, Lyon, Venice, Rome, Naples, Palermo, Malta, Florence and Strasbourg and studying law at the University of Bologna. He returned to the Netherlands shortly after the outbreak of the Dutch Revolt and the death of his father in the battle of Heiligerlee. His mother wanted him to stay neutral in the revolt and used her influence to have him sent on diplomatic missions. In 1570 he joined Archduchess Anna of Austria and her two brothers, the Archdukes Albert and Wenceslaus on their journey to the court of Philip II. From there, the king sent him on a mission to Charles IX of France to salute the birth of Marie Elisabeth of Valois. On his way back from a pilgrimage (1573) to Rome and Loreto, Charles of Arenberg accompanied the widowed Elisabeth of Austria from Nancy to the Imperial Court in Vienna (1575‚Äì1576). During his stay in Vienna Arenberg was raised to a princely county. In the meantime, the rebellious States of Holland had confiscated his estates in 1572. After a brief restitution in 1577, they were once again seized in 1579. In the process these properties suffered considerable damage.Tytgat (1994) pp. 7‚Äì13. In service of the House of Habsburg Princely Count Charles of Arenberg at the Somerset House Conference (third on the left)In August 1581, Alexander Farnese appointed Charles of Arenberg colonel of a regiment of German cavalry. He saw action during the Cologne War (1582‚Äì1584), notably in the Siege of Godesberg (1583), participated in the sieges of Antwerp (1585) and of Sluis (1587) and joined Farnese's campaign in France (1590).Tytgat (1994) pp. 13‚Äì16 On 27 April 1586, Charles of Arenberg was awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece. In the same year, he made his entry in the Collateral Councils that advised the governor-general. Philip II appointed him a member of the Council of State and one of the heads of the Council of Finance. The following year, he was among the delegation that met with the envoys of Queen Elisabeth I at Bourbourg in 1587, in a feigned attempt to end hostilities between England and Spain. At the accession of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, Arenberg saw his loyalty to the House of Habsburg rewarded. He was maintained as a member of the Council of State (1598) and was appointed a gentleman of the archducal Bedchamber (1599), lieutenant-general and admiral of the Netherlands and president of the Council of Admiralty (1599) and finally grand falconer of the Netherlands (1600).Tytgat (1994) pp. 16‚Äì17. For the next few years, Charles of Arenberg acted as the Archduke's most prestigious ambassador. In 1598 he was among the delegation that went to Paris to witness the ratification of the Treaty of Vervins by Henry IV of France. He returned to the French Court two years later, to congratulate the king on his marriage with Marie de' Medici.Tytgat (1994) p. 17. In June 1603 Charles of Arenberg was sent on an embassy to congratulate King James VI and I upon his accession to the English throne. On 4 October he had an audience with Anne of Denmark.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), p. 48. The mission was meant to pave the way for an end to the Anglo-Spanish War, but almost backfired when Arenberg was wrongfully accused of involvement in the Main and Bye Plots. The following year, he headed the archducal delegation that negotiated the Treaty of London.Allen (2000) pp. 99‚Äì140. Increasingly suffering from gout, Charles of Arenberg thereafter withdrew from active politics. In 1607 he and his wife bought the domain at Enghien from Henry IV of France. He recuperated the expense by selling off the Dutch possessions that had been restored to him by the Twelve Years' Truce.Tytgat (1994) pp. 18‚Äì20. The lordships of Naaldwijk and Terschelling were among the goods that were sold. In order to make Enghien their principal seat, the Arenbergs rebuilt the castle and made many improvements to the gardens, with Robert Cecil's gardens at Theobalds House allegedly serving as an example. In the town of Enghien they founded a Capuchin monastery that would henceforth serve as the dynasty's necropolis.Derez (2002) pp. 168‚Äì210. Marriage and descendants Charles of Arenberg was the founder of the third and present House of Arenberg. On 4 January 1587 he married Anne de Cro√ø, the eldest daughter of Philippe III de Cro√ø, 3rd duke of Aarschot. When his brother-in- law, Charles III of Cro√ø, 5th Prince of Chimay, 4th duke of Aarschot, died without issue in 1612, most of his titles and estates passed to Anne and her descendants.

He was one of the signatories of the Costa Rican Declaration of Independence. Bonilla was baptized in Cartago, Costa Rica on September 30, 1763. His parents were Sergeant Major Andr√©s de Bonilla y S√°enz and Mar√≠a Gertrudis de Laya-Bol√≠var y Miranda. Jos√© Santiago de Bonilla y Laya-Bol√≠var, president of Costa Rica's governing junta in 1822, was his brother. Bonilla was ordained as a priest in Guatemala. He was in charge of several parishes in Costa Rica and was the proprietor of valuable ranching property. He was called by the nickname Padre Tiricia (Father Jaundice), apparently because he suffered from the disease. The ayuntamientos of the town of Bagaces, the city of Esparza, and several indigenous peoples designated Bonilla in October 1821 as their representative in the Junta de Legados de los Ayuntamientos that met in Cartago on October 25‚Äì26, 1821 to discuss Costa Rica's independence from Spain. On October 29, 1821, he attended the session of the ayuntamiento of Cartago en which the Costa Rican Declaration of Independence was ratified. He was one of the members of the Costa Rican republican party during the era of independence. One of the supporters of the empire, the Catalan Juan Freses de √ëeco, son-in-law of the royalist military commander Joaqu√≠n de Oreamuno y Mu√±oz de la Trinidad, shouted, \\"Padre Tiricia returns, because we will kill him!\\" (¬°Ese padre Tiricia que se vuelva, porque lo matamos!), and immediately shot him with a bullet that pierced his cassock. Bonilla walked to Alajuela with Rafael Francisco Osejo, president of the toppled government, and there they convinced Gregorio Jos√© Ram√≠rez y Castro to command the republican forces, who defeated the royalists in the Battle of Ochomogo the following April 5.

It provides LEED services for larger-scale green buildings in Canada. Enermodal has designed a number of award-winning low-energy building projects in Canada and the USA. It is now part of the MMM Group.  History  Enermodal Engineering was founded in 1980 by three University of Waterloo graduates including current president Stephen Carpenter. Initially the firm focused on developing software to assess renewable energy systems and building energy usage. This work included software to analyze the energy performance of windows; this software became the tool to rate windows to NFRC and CSA window standards. In 1991, the firm designed and managed the construction of the Waterloo Green Home ‚Äì a winning entry in the Canadian federal government Advanced Houses competition. The house was widely viewed as one of the best examples of residential green buildings and was the subject of a book, Green Home, by Wayne Grady. Enermodal designed and occupied the first green office building in Canada in 1996: \\"Green on the Grand\\" in Kitchener, Ontario was a winning design under the Canadian government's C2000 program that promoted green office buildings. With an annual energy use of just over 100 kWh/m2, Green on the Grand is still one of the most efficient office buildings in Canada. Another Enermodal building is the University of Ottawa Biology Building, which achieved 70% energy savings and was given several energy efficiency awards. The firm began designing and certifying buildings to the LEED Green Building Rating System in 2004 (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).Canada Green Building Council LEED certification guidelines http://www.cagbc.org/leed/what/index.php The firm successfully certified the first building (Stratus Winery) under the Canadian version of LEED. To deal with growing demand for their services, Enermodal opened offices in Calgary (2006), Toronto (2008), Edmonton (2009), and Winnipeg (2010). Cambridge City Hall; Cambridge, Ontario Enermodal won the International Building Performance Simulation Association's \\"Outstanding Practise Award\\" in 2007 and the SAB Magazine Sustainable Architecture & Building Award, for the Toronto Region Conservation Authority Restoration Services Centre, in 2008. In 2009, Enermodal designed and built its own headquarters, A Grander View, which uses 70 kWh/m2 \\\\- making it Canada's most energy-efficient office building. This building achieved three LEED Platinum certifications and became Canada's most energy-efficient office. In November 2010, the company was purchased by and became a division of the MMM group (Marshall Macklin Monaghan). Enermodal had a professional staff of over 100 at its five offices, making it one of North America's largest consulting firms focusing exclusively on the design of sustainable buildings. Enermodal Engineering was Canada's largest consulting firm exclusively dedicated to green buildings and communities. With a staff of experts in the area of green and energy efficient buildings and specialists that were based in Kitchener, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Toronto, Enermodal is working on sustainability projects worth over $5 billion. For 30 years, Enermodal has marketed green building technologies including rainwater cisterns, onsite biofiltration, radiant cooling, building renewable energy systems, and variable refrigerant flow systems. Up to 2010, when it was purchased by MMM, Enermodal was the foremost LEED consulting firm, delivering the LEED 2009 Rating System. Employees served as LEED Faculty members, and President Stephen Carpenter was at the time appointed chair of the Technical Advisory Committee at the CaGBC. Enermodal had been involved with 250 LEED projects across North America, and was in 2010 responsible for 45% of all LEED Canada certified buildings. Enermodal provided LEED services for larger-scale green buildings in Canada, including the Toronto Region Conservation Authority's Restoration Services Centre (first Platinum certification in Ontario), Fifth Town Cheese (first Platinum industrial certification), Currie Barracks (first Canadian Stage 2 LEED-ND certification), and the RBC Centre (at the time, largest LEED project in Canada). Enermodal's main areas of expertise were * sustainable design (particularly Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification) * \\"green\\" mechanical/electrical design and commissioning * research into the performance of environmentally appropriate technologies * building inspection and energy audits * energy performance rating windows, doors, and walls. The company had a green incentive program which helped employees reduce their environmental footprint. The company sponsored incentives include free bus passes, rain barrels, low-flow shower heads, and financial support for the purchase of hybrid cars.  Acquisition  Enermodal Engineering was purchased by MMM Engineers in 2010. MMM was subsequently purchased by WSP in 2016.  Selected projects  Enermodal had over 70 LEED certified buildings and - at the time of their purchase - were working on over 190 other buildings aiming for certification.

He obtained his Maestro Normal degree in the Escuela Normal de Heredia, where he was later employed. In 1897 he left for Chile on a scholarship, where he studied Law, French and Latin. He later studied phylology in the Instituto Pedag√≥gico de Chile. He returned to Costa Rica in 1900 and taught Castellano, Psychology and Logic in the Liceo de Costa Rica. He also became the Liceo de Heredia's first headmaster from 1905 to 1908. In 1917, under Federico Tinoco's dictatorship he was named Minister for Public Education. A year later he left for the United States under voluntary exile. In the United States Brenes Mes√©n was employed in varied roles, including Minister for Costa Rica in Washington, Columbia University professor, as well as the University of New Mexico and Syracuse University. During the first decade of the 20th century, he began working as a journalist, and he began attending political meetings with Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Monge.

Brother of the poet and folklorist Alexander Kaufmann, he became Chief Burgomaster of Bonn. Life=1840s-1850s With his brother Alexander, he attended the grammar school of his native city, and in the autumn of 1840, through Ernst Moritz Arndt, who had shortly before been reinstated in his professorship, Kaufmann matriculated as student of law at the University of Bonn. His sister Maria Theresia Julia (Julia) Kaufmann was the mother of Francis Hueffer, German-English music critic and librettist and thus the grandmother of Ford Madox Ford, Oliver Madox Hueffer and Juliet Catherine Emma Hueffer (wife of David Soskice and mother of Frank Soskice). His friends included Felix Mendelssohn, and Franz Liszt, and the poet Gottfried Kinkel. They with his future wife Johanna, n√©e Mockel, founded a poetical society called the \\"Maik√§ferbund\\". On the occasion of the first Beethoven festival and of the unveiling of the Beethoven Monument, in the summer of 1845, Kaufmann founded the male choral society of Bonn, the \\"Concordia\\". When the revolutionary disturbances broke out in May 1848, and many of the burgomasters in the Rhenish provinces voluntarily gave up their positions, he was appointed first government referendary of the burgomaster administrator at Unkel on the Rhine, and one year later deputy landrath or president of the District of Zell on the Moselle. In October 1850, he was elected Burgomaster of Bonn, which at that time contained 18,000 inhabitants, and assumed office in the following May. In 1859, he received the title of chief burgomaster. 1860s-1870s Among the enterprises which he planned for the welfare of the city may be mentioned the foundations for docks on the Rhine, the drainage of the entire city, laying out new plans for alignment and rebuilding, and eventually for a canal. He laid out the city in districts; he also built an asylum for the insane. He provided for the young by a systematic reorganization of the public schools, and for the support of the orphans. He worked for the artistic adornment of the cemetery of Bonn, of the tombs of Schiller's widow and his son Ernst, those of the composer Robert Schumann, and the poet August Wilhelm Schlegel. In 1861, Kaufmann was appointed by the King of Prussia a life member of the Upper House on the nomination of the city of Bonn. On the question of reforming the army, he voted with the so-called constitutional deputies on 11 October 1862, for the budget as arranged by the Lower House. On the Beethoven centenary in 1870, the Beethovenhalle was built. In August 1871, the Beethoven music festival was held, and in August 1873, the Schumann festival, two significant musical events, the success of which was largely due to Kaufmann, and which procured for Bonn the renown of a first- class artistic centre. After the Vatican decree of 18 July 1870, Bonn and Munich became the centres of the Old Catholic movement. Whilst several of Kaufmann's friends joined the new sect, he remained true to the Catholic Church. In 1874, he was unanimously re-elected burgomaster for the third time by the town council of Bonn, for a term of twelve years, but he became a victim of the Kulturkampf. Although he recognized the necessity for the government taking measures with the object of regulating its attitude towards the Church, and declared himself prepared in his official capacity to carry out the May Laws, his confirmation was refused by the administration on 8 May 1875, a measure which resulted in an interpellation by Windt-Lorst in the Reichstag and the Prussian Diet. At the end of 1876, Kaufmann was elected to the Lower House from the electoral district of M√ºnchen-Gladbach, joined the Centre party, and soon became a member of its governing committee. In the Reichstag he frequently spoke in the interest of art and science. He was likewise one of the founders of the \\"G√∂rresgesellschaft\\", for fostering science in Catholic Germany (1876), and for the first fifteen years was its general secretary. 1880s After 1882, he was vice-president of the Borromeo Society for disseminating good books. In 1886, he refused re-election to the Reichstag, and henceforth devoted himself to the promotion of art and of useful undertakings, particularly to the decoration of Bonn Cathedral.  Works  Among his writings were: * \\"Albrecht D√ºrer\\" (Cologne, 1881; 2nd ed., 1887); * \\"Bilder aus dem Rheinland\\" (1884); * \\"Philipp Veit, Vortr√§ge √ºber Kunst\\" (1891).

Crockham Heath is part of the civil parish of Enborne (where according to the grid ref the majority of the 2011 Census population was included). The settlement lies near to the A34 road, and is located approximately south-west of Newbury where administration occurs.  Civil War  Crockham Heath was mentioned as having a part of the First Battle of Newbury during the English Civil War in 1648. It was mentioned as one of two unenclosed pieces of land in the battlefield. It was used as an assembly point for a small number of Royalist soldiers and it was claimed that Prince Rupert routed the Parliamentary cavalry who had attempted to attack it to disrupt the Royal supply line. However, despite eye witness accounts talking about a little heath south of Enbourne, the historian Walter Money argued that the heath could not have been Crockham Heath due to the fact it was too small and too low to have supplied an army located on a hill and could have been easily taken. Money argued that it meant Enbourne Heath. Other sources claim that it was the Parliamentarians who had used Crockham Heath with Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex using it to camp the day before the battle though he camped in a nearby house. Some Victorian historians claimed they slept in battle order but there are no contemporary sources that make that claim.  Listed buildings  There are two Historic England listed buildings in Crockham Heath. One is a grade II 18th century farmhouse listed in 1983 and a grade II listed pair of cottages on Church Lane.

Early life Castillo was born on October 17, 1778 in Ujarr√°s, near Cartago, the colonial capital of the Province of Costa Rica, part of New Spain. He was the third child of Cecilia del Castillo y Villagra (sometimes called Cecilia del Castillo y Solano), widow of a Frenchman, Fran√ßois Lafons. His father is not known; it is possible he was the illegitimate son of the village priest, Luis San Mart√≠n de Soto, a Capuchin friar. He grew up in the friary of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception de Rescate de Ujarr√°s, where he earned his living cleaning and working as an altar boy. Cecilia del Castillo belonged to a distinguished family in Costa Rica and possessed some money that allowed her to send her son to the Seminario Conciliar in Le√≥n, Nicaragua (which in 1812 was converted into the University of Le√≥n, Nicaragua), to pursue an ecclesiastical career. After being distinguished for his intelligence and spotless record, Castillo presented brilliant exam results, obtained a baccalaureate and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1802. The next year he was already a professor of geometry at the same university with an official recommendation. Castillo returned to Costa Rica preceded by the fame that his accomplishments had gained him in Nicaragua, and in 1806 he was named pastor of the incipient town of Villahermosa (later Alajuela; but aspiring to a higher destination, he returned in 1808 to Le√≥n, entering the Tridentine University where he gained the post of professor of philosophy, which had been one of his most gifted disciplines, and later the more important charges of synodal examiner, prosecutor and vice-rector. These rapid promotions, combined with the prestige won during his short return to Costa Rica, meant that when it came time to select a deputy for the Province of Costa Rica to the Cortes of C√°diz in Spain, convened for the salvation of Spain's independence--which was threatened by the formidable power of Napoleon who invaded the nation--his name was included, along with that of Friar Jos√© Antonio Taboada y Jos√© Mar√≠a Zamora. Deputy to the Cortes In 1810 Costa Rica selected Castillo to represent it in the Cortes of Spain, where he was called the \\"American Mirabeau\\" for his magnificent oratory. He was distinguished for his struggle in favor of the Indians and blacks and achieved the abolition of the Mita, the Encomienda, Indian tribute and the Repartimiento. He presided over the courts for a brief period. He also campaigned against other forms of racial discrimination. He also represented Costa Rica in the ordinary courts of 1813-1814, until their dissolution by Fernando VII. Deputy to the Mexican Congress and Imperial Council After the dissolution of the Courts, Castillo moved to Mexico, where he represented Costa Rica in the Constituent Congress of 1822. Afterwards he was a member of the Council of State of Emperor Agust√≠n I (Agust√≠n de Iturbide). Death Castillo died in Oaxaca on November 26, 1834, where he was a canon of the diocese and administrator of the diocese. In 1971 his remains were returned to Costa Rica, where they were interred in a mausoleum built in the central park of the town of Para√≠so, near his birthplace of Ujarr√°s. His remains rested there until they were stolen in September 2011. The Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica declared him a \\"Benem√©rito de la Patria\\", or \\"Worthy Citizen of the Fatherland\\". The highway between San Jos√© and Cartago bears his name. In 1971 the Mexican State of Oaxaca awarded Florencio del Castillo a posthumous medal for his outstanding effort.

(North America: freight cars),Rail car types defined, Union Pacific Railroad, 2019 also known as goods carriages, goods trucks, freight carriages or freight trucks, are unpowered railway vehicles that are used for the transportation of cargo. A variety of wagon types are in use to handle different types of goods, but all goods wagons in a regional network typically have standardized couplers and other fittings, such as hoses for air brakes, allowing different wagon types to be assembled into trains. For tracking and identification purposes, goods wagons are generally assigned a unique identifier, typically a UIC wagon number, or in North America, a company reporting mark plus a company specific serial number.  Development  At the beginning of the railway era, the vast majority of goods wagons were four-wheeled vehicles of simple construction. These were almost exclusively small covered wagons, open wagons with side-boards, and flat wagons with or without stakes. Over the course of time, an increasing number of specialised wagons were developed. Special wagons for specific purposes or wagons with special features were already being introduced around 1850 by private companies. Amongst these were tank wagons and numerous refrigerated vans. In countries like Germany, wagon hire firms procured large numbers of these wagons and hired them to the end users. In the early days of the railway, goods trains still ran at top speeds of only about . However, the introduction of through brakes using air pipes (such as the Kunze-Knorr brakes in Germany) from the 1920s enabled higher speeds to be safely achieved. Modern goods wagons are authorised for speeds up to around and in certain countries, wagons are increasingly equipped with GPS receivers and transponders which provide location monitoring as required. The Deutsche Bahn (DB) even has goods wagons cleared for high-speed rail travel at up to . Because the braking distance of fast goods trains is longer than the separation between distant and home signals (as are Express Passenger trains), they may only run at high speeds of with locos on routes with early signalling systems in the driver's cab (LZB, FZB and ETCS).  German wagon history  In Europe, the first agreements were struck very early on between the national state railways (L√§nderbahnen) and private companies for the mutual use of each other's goods wagons. Around 1850, the Union of German Railway Administrations (Verein Deutscher Eisenbahnverwaltungen) drew up regulations for the standardisation of dimensions and fittings. The formation of the Prussian State Railway Union in 1881 encouraged the emergence of wagon classes built to standard norms. One further European milestone was the formation of the German State Railway Wagon Association on 1 April 1909. With the participation of all the German state railways, it created a common pool of goods wagons, which by the end of 1911 had no less than 560,000 wagons. In addition, they all had standardised inscriptions and red-brown livery. In order to standardise future procurements, a total of 11 wagon classes were defined (Sheet nos. A1 to A11). These wagons of the so-called standard class (Verbandsbauart) and subsequent developments from them (the Austauschbauart class with interchangeable parts) dominated goods traffic in Germany up to the Second World War and had a significant impact in many other countries which acquired these wagons either through war reparations or simply because they were left behind by the Germans after the two world wars. From 1939, wagons were developed primarily from a military point of view and were known as wartime classes (Kriegsbauart). After the war, in East Germany, some pre-war goods wagon classes were given a new lease of life as ‚Äòreconstructed goods wagons‚Äô (Reko-G√ºterwagen) and continued in service for several more decades. Since the Union of Private Goods Wagon Companies (Vereinigung der Privatg√ºterwagen-Interessenten (VPI)) was founded in 1921, the interests of private transport organisations in Germany (including wagon hire firms, goods wagon builders and repair firms, and owners of private sidings) has been jointly represented. The Union has around 100 members who own 50,000 goods wagons. In 2007, they transported of goods. ‚Äì S. 4 Other countries have similar organisations.  European wagon history  Since 1922, the agreement for the mutual use of goods wagons in international traffic (RIV) has regulated the exchange of goods wagons in Europe and the Middle East. In addition, international goods wagon fleets were created in 1953 in Western Europe with the Europ-Verband and in 1965 in Eastern Europe with the Common Goods Wagon Park (OPW). During the second half of the 20th century, national goods wagon classes in Europe were increasingly replaced by Union internationale des chemins de fer (UIC) standard wagons. Since 1964, all goods wagons in Germany, for example, have had to be classified using the UIC goods wagon classification system. North American history Freight railroads in North American have always been almost entirely privately owned. The separate northern and southern U.S. track gauges were unified on June 1, 1886, allowing freight cars to be interchanged throughout the continent. The Safety Appliance Act of 1893 made air brakes and automatic couplers mandatory on all trains in the United States, effective 1900. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) had its origins in 1872 as the American Railway Association, initially to coordinate time tables. The AAR has developed various standards for freight cars over the years, including couplers, loading gauges, reporting marks, interchange rules, and information systems, through its Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices publications.http://www.aar.org https://www.fridgexpress.com/  Types of goods wagon  The numerous types of goods wagon are categorised here based on their main design features and in accordance with the international UIC classification system: * Open wagons (US/Canada: gondolas) were formerly referred to in Germany as O wagons; today the international standard types are: ** Open wagons of standard design (UIC Class E) with at least high walls, with side-doors, and without self-discharging equipment ** Open wagons of special design (UIC Class F) ‚Äì especially self-discharging wagons (see photo) of type Fcs092. ** Lowmacs ** Bogie bolster wagon * Covered wagons or vans (US/Canada: boxcars) have a fixed roof and are mainly used for the transportation of part-load goods or parcels. Today these are divided into: ** Ordinary classes (UIC Class G) ** Special classes (UIC Class H), which are often distinguished by their large loading volumes. ** Livestock vans (US/Canada:stock cars) for transporting cattle are no longer used. In Germany they were called V wagons and were counted as a special class. * Refrigerated vans (Class I wagons), formerly known in Germany as T wagons (T = \\"Thermos\\") ‚Äì are insulated covered vans which are either cooled by a cooling medium such as water or dry ice like conventional refrigerated vans, or are machine-cooled wagons with their own cooling system. * Flat wagons (US: Flatcars) have no walls or low walls no higher than . Today these include wagons with individual axles in UIC Classes K (standard) or L (special), bogie wagons of UIC Classes R (standard) or S (special). * Wagon with opening roof **Wagons with sliding roof (UIC Class T) either have a flat wagon floor or equipment for self- discharging. * Special wagons of UIC Class U include powder wagons and low- loading wagons * Tank wagons (UIC Class Z) are suitable for a wide variety of fluids and gases. * Spine cars to carry intermodal containers. Goods wagons for special purposes include: * Departmental wagons are used by railway administrations exclusively for their own internal purposes (such as the slag wagons of Class X in Germany which were mainly based on old open wagons of Class O), * Ferry wagons with smaller loading gauges for traffic travelling to Great Britain, which were designated with a lower case letter f. * the rarely mixed open, flat wagons of UIC Class O, which are equipped with folding sides or stakes and can be used either as flats or as open goods wagons. * Mineral wagons Railway post vans (Mobile post offices) are not counted as goods wagons. The UIC's instructions were sometimes interpreted differently by the various railway administrations, so that it could happen that almost identical wagons were grouped into different classes. In addition wagons had occasionally to be reclassified after slight modifications. For example, an E Class wagon can become an F Class simply through welding on a door.

In England, a prominent young prosecutor in a murder trial is unaware that his wife is involved. It is based on Bernard Merivale's 1935 play The Unguarded Hour, an adaptation of an earlier Hungarian work by Ladislas Fodor. Some changes were made from the play in order to heighten the drama, including having the heroine as the elusive witness in connection with the trial.Kabatchnik p.431 The film's set designs were overseen by Cedric Gibbons, assisted by Edwin B. Willis and Joseph Wright. Dolly Tree designed the costumes. Plot Barrister Sir Alan Dearden is tipped to be Britain's next and youngest ever Attorney General. Shortly before he leaves for holiday on the Continent, his wife Helen is approached by a man claiming to have love letters written by her husband to his own estranged wife. Although these pre-date their marriage, Helen worries that scandal would ruin her husband's career and reluctantly agrees to pay the blackmail demand of ¬£2,000. The following day she draws the money out of the bank and meets the blackmailer in Dover, eventually leaving the money on the White Cliffs. While she is recovering the love letters she sees a middle-aged man warning his wife not to go to near the edge. She is enjoying her holiday with her husband, when he is urgently called back to London to take over a murder case at the Old Bailey involving a man named Metford accused of pushing his wife over a cliff. A shocked Helen realises that she is the key witness in the case, but elects to remain silent. During cross-examination, Dearden hounds Metford over his claims that there was a female witness who saw him warning his wife to take care, but points out a nationwide hunt has not produced this missing woman. Helen does what she can to persuade her husband that Metford is innocent and that people often make poor witnesses when they are telling the truth, but he is unmoved. Then, during the trial, Dearden is himself approached by his former flame - encouraged by her estranged husband - who demands blackmail money from him. When shortly afterwards she is found murdered, Scotland Yard investigate and find the finger of suspicion is pointed at Dearden. While he has a genuine excuse of her spent the \\"unguarded hour\\" in question, like Metford his story sounds unbelievable. In a sensational development, Lady Helen is subpoenaed by the defence in order to clear the accused, which she does. She then manages to entrap the original blackmailer into revealing that he was the man who killed his wife.

She was one of √ìscar Arias S√°nchez's two Vice-Presidents and his administration's Minister of Justice. She was the governing PLN candidate for president in the 2010 general election, where she won with 46.76% of the vote on 7 February. She was the eighth woman president of a Latin American country and the first woman to become President of Costa Rica. She was sworn in as President of Costa Rica on May 8, 2010.Economist.comSkard, Torild (2014) \\"Laura Chinchilla\\" in Women of power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide, Bristol: Policy Press , pp. 238-40 She currently teaches at Georgetown University and is co-chair of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank. Personal life Chinchilla was born in Carmen Central, San Jos√© in 1959. She is the daughter of Rafael √Ångel Chinchilla Fallas, a former comptroller of Costa Rica, and Emilce Miranda Castillo. She married Mario Alberto Madrigal D√≠az on 23 January 1982 and divorced on 22 May 1985. Chinchilla met her second husband, Jos√© Mar√≠a Rico Cueto, a Spanish lawyer who held Canadian citizenship, in 1990 while both were working as consultants for the Center for the Administration of Justice at the University of Florida in Miami, Florida. The couple had a son, Jos√© Mar√≠a Rico Chinchilla, in 1996. Chinchilla married Rico on 26 March 2000. She was widowed on April 15, 2019, when her husband Jos√© Mar√≠a Rico died due to Alzheimer's. Political career Chinchilla graduated from the University of Costa Rica and received her master's degree in public policy from Georgetown University. Prior to entering politics, Chinchilla worked as an NGO consultant in Latin America and Africa, specializing in judicial reform and public security issues. She went on to serve in the Jos√© Mar√≠a Figueres Olsen administration as vice-minister for public security (1994‚Äì1996) and minister of public security (1996‚Äì1998). From 2002 to 2006, she served in the National Assembly as a deputy for the province of San Jos√©. Chinchilla was one of two vice-presidents elected under the second Arias administration (2006‚Äì2010). She resigned the vice-presidency in 2008 in order to prepare her run for the presidency in 2010. On 7 June 2009 she won the Partido Liberaci√≥n Nacional (PLN) primary with a 15% margin over her nearest rival, and was thus endorsed as the party's presidential candidate. Chinchilla led the Observation Mission deployed by the OAS to Mexico to observe the June 2015 federal election, as well as the Observation Electoral Mission during the 2016 elections in the US, and the electoral process in Brazil and in Paraguay in 2018. Laura Chinchilla. Presidency Chinchilla's Partido Liberaci√≥n Nacional is a member of the Socialist International, whose motto is the promotion of \\"progressive politics for a better world.\\" The British Foreign and Commonwealth minister with responsibility for Central America, Baroness Kinnock, applauded Chinchilla's election as the first female President of Costa Rica. Kinnock also praised Chinchilla for stating her continued support for the forward thinking approach by the previous government in working to combat climate change and said that the UK would continue to work with Costa Rica on this important issue in 2010. She was expected to give continuity to the previous government's pro-free trade policies. She is considered a social conservative. She opposes gay marriage, but has stated publicly the need for a legal frame to provide fundamental rights to same-sex couples. She supports maintaining the country's prohibition of abortion under most circumstances. Laura Chinchilla's political platform emphasized anti-crime legislation in response to Costa Rica's growing concerns over safety. In 2010, the year in which Laura Chinchilla was elected president of Costa Rica, the country observed a high crime rate in practically all crimes, which contributed to deteriorating the perception of the state as guarantor of justice and security. Added to this was the economic insecurity caused by the international crisis of 2007 and 2008 that had hit the Costa Rican economy. Attending these circumstances, President Chinchilla structured a government plan based on human security and with a comprehensive security approach, which contemplated four key components: * Economic security and competitiveness. * Social security and welfare. * Citizen security and social peace. * Environmental security and development. At the end of her term, the main achievements were: The recovery of the economy from the effects of the international crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, which grew between 2010‚Äì2013, at an average rate of 4.4%, growth that has remained constant in recent years according to data from ECLAC, this along with an improvement in the country's competitiveness indexes, according to the World Economic Forum and the World Bank, as well as the beginning of the process of incorporating Costa Rica into the OECD. In social matters, priority was given to the promotion of a comprehensive strategy for early childhood care. Her government developed a network of care centers with public-private partnerships, that benefit the children, as well as their mothers who aspire to enter the labor market. This program was recognized by international organizations. Regarding the issue of security, after conducting a citizen consultation, the Citizen Security and Social Peace Policy (POLSEPAZ) was designed, defining the main strategic lines of action and the need to promote a comprehensive, sustainable and State policy on the matter. With the implementation of this strategy and the prevention, control, and sanctions activities that were carried out, it was possible to contain the growth that criminality had been experiencing, and decrease homicide rates, as well as intentional homicides against women, most of which are associated with domestic violence or femicide. They fell between 2010 and 2013 by nearly 70%. The government sustainability variable was expressed in the promotion of policies for the generation of clean energy which allowed that at the end of her period it exceeded 90% of electricity generation from renewable sources. Equal importance was given to the protection of the seas, through the extension of marine protection zones and a strong fight against shark finning, all of which meant international recognition for the efforts made in sustainability. In 2013, however, the Mexican opinion poll firm Consulta Mitofsky released a survey that placed Chinchilla as the least popular president in Latin America with a 13% approval rate, just behind Porfirio Lobo of Honduras.\\"Presidente Chinchilla en s√≥tano de popularidad en Am√©rica Latina\\" Security During her tenure, improvements were made in security, and the homicide rate, originally 10 for every 100,000 inhabitants, dropped significantly . The WHO had the once high figure a ‚Äúsocial pandemic‚Äù and it has fluctuated greatly in years prior. Education Education became one Chinchilla's greatest priorities. She moved into action Article 78 of Costa Rica‚Äôs Constitution, The Strengthening Education Effort, whereby the government must allocate 8% of its funding toward education. During her tenure the actual figure reached 7.2%, the highest of any country in the region. =The Juan Rafael Mora Porras Road affair= In October 2010, Nicaraguan forces occupied islands in the San Juan River delta. The land is claimed by the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican governments. Some observers opined that the Nicaraguan action was probably connected with President Daniel Ortega's reelection campaign.Dredging up votes: Daniel Ortega and the swamps of opportunism The Economist Nov. 11, 2010 The Costa Rican government reacted to the Nicaraguan action. Costa Rica sought to place the case before the International Court of Justice. By mid-2011, President Chinchilla decided to build a road along the river, as a response to what she and her government saw as a Nicaraguan invasion of Costa Rican territory. In Spanish Name of the Road The road was officially named ‚ÄúRuta 1858, Juan Rafael Mora Porras‚Äù to honor a Costa Rican hero, who led the country in the fight in Nicaragua and Costa Rica against the forces of William Walker, who had proclaimed himself as president of Nicaragua, and wanted to restore slavery in Central America. The road was to stretch more than 150 km. A decree of emergency allowed the government to waive environmental regulations and oversight from the General Comptroller (Contraloria General de la Republica). Neither environmental nor engineering studies were conducted before the road was announced. There were accusations of mismanagement and corruption. The Ministerio Publico (Costa Rican attorney general) announced an official inquiry about the charges of corruption. Francisco Jim√©nez, minister of public works and transportation was dismissed by Chinchilla as a consequence of the affair Minister dismissed by Chinchilla (in Spanish). Views on society Laura Chinchilla developed and signed the National Network of Care Act which works to provide care and assistance to children and the elderly.http://noticias.lainformacion.com/asuntos-sociales/adultos- mayores-y-ancianos/laura-chinchilla-firma-ley-para-el-cuidado-de-ninos-y- ancianos_xszQ5NmZMgUfef1FlStXj7/ Chinchilla opposes any amendment of the constitution aimed at separation of church and state in Costa Rica. The constitution currently defines the Republic of Costa Rica as a Roman Catholic nation.

There he was in contact with the avant-garde poet and painter Lajos Kass√°k, who familiarized him with the tenets of constructivism and suprematism. His earliest work as an architectural draftsman, from 1919, displayed constructivist tendencies. In that same year he would write the manifesto \\"Section d'Or\\" (The Golden Section), which did not appear in Paris until 1939. From 1920 to 1924, Be√∂thy studied under J√°nos Vaszary at the Hungarian University of Fine Arts. He travelled on a grant to Vienna, from where he undertook other travels to western Europe, until in 1925 he settled in Paris. Be√∂thy found a place in the Parisian art scene and took part in the exhibit of the Salon des Ind√©pendants. In 1927 he married Anna Steiner, and in 1928 he had his first one-man show in the Galerie Sacre-Printemps. In 1931, Be√∂thy co- founded the group Abstraction-Creation with sculptor Georges Vantongerloo and painter Auguste Herbin, and was its vice-president for a time. From 1931 to 1939, he had an exclusive contract with Leonce Rosenberg's Galerie de l'Effort Moderne, and in 1938 he organized an exhibit in Budapest, which was the first exposure of his nonfigurative art to the public in Hungary. Like Herbin, he later explored parallels to other forms of self-expression, particularly music. His sculptures after this point develop along the lines of harmonies, which interact with each other like musical notes. During World War II Be√∂thy designed fliers for the French Resistance. In 1946, he became a founding member of the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles, and the Galerie Maeght in Paris showed a retrospective of his work. In 1951, he became a founding member of another group, \\"Espace\\", and founded the journal \\"Formes et Vie\\", with Fernand L√©ger and Le Corbusier. For a short time between 1952 and 1953, he gave lectures on color and proportion to architecture classes at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and in his subsequent years he worked together with architects and was otherwise part of the planning for the expansion of Le Havre. Be√∂thy died in Paris on 27 November 1961.

He was born in Minnesota on June 5, 1884, and moved to California in 1902. It is not known how he became interested in photography, but by the early 1920s he was a member of the Oakland Camera Club, the San Francisco Photographic Society, and the Pictorial Photographers of America. His early photographs were in the pictorialist style, but by the late 1920s he had changed to a pure straight photography style. Sometime around 1930 he met Willard Van Dyke and Edward Weston. Within two years they had become good friends, and in 1932 Edwards was invited to be a founding member of Group f/64, along with Weston, Van Dyke, Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Sonya Noskowiak and Henry Swift. He participated in the landmark Group f/64 exhibit at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, showing nine images of boats, anchor chains and farm wagons. He continued to photograph for many years after Group f/64 dissolved in 1935, but he did not gain any of the fame of many other members of the group. In 1967 he and his wife donated a collection of photographs to the Oakland Museum. He died in Oakland, California, in 1968. References *Heyman, Therese Thau.

His next election campaign was in the 1962 federal election where he won the Shefford riding for the Social Credit Party.

Rondeau won the Shefford seat back in the following national election in 1968, and was re-elected in 1972 and 1974. Being one of the few Social Credit politicians who was able to speak English, Rondeau helped represent the predominantly francophone party across Canada. But Rondeau's political career was ended by charges of Unemployment Insurance fraud for which he was convicted and sentenced to a five-month prison term.

Separate local services boards provide services in Robinson and Dawson townships.Local Services Boards, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 737. Canadian Legal Information Institute. Communities The division includes the communities of Burnt Island, Cook's Dock, Fernlee, Meldrum Bay and Silver Water. Meldrum Bay Meldrum Bay () is located at the western terminus of Highway 540, 72 kilometers west of Gore Bay, in Dawson township. Settled in the 1870s, and named after a town in Scotland, Meldrum Bay developed as a commercial fishing and lumbering centre. Once the village was home to a busy fishing fleet, and Great Lakes steamers tied up at the docks. From the 1920s the Owen Sound Transportation Companysteamers provided weekly ferry service between Meldrum Bay and Thessalon, on its route between Owen Sound and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, however, the 1962 opening of the Trans-Canada Highway, and other road improvements has made this service unprofitable. Now during the summer, the docks are busy again, lined with pleasure craft from around the Great Lakes. This area holds some of the best chinook salmon fishing in all of Canada. Many residents of the area are employed by Lafarge, whose quarry near Meldrum Bay produces dolomite used in concrete, road construction and metallurgical processing. This Lafarge Canada site is the home of the \\"largest Canadian marine quarry,\\" with loading docks on the Mississagi Strait. Silver Water Silver Water () is the largest community in Robinson township, located on Highway 540 approximately 42 kilometers west of Gore Bay. It has a year-round population of approximately 62 families, which almost doubles during the summer months. It is a vibrant rural community, with the majority of the population being retired seniors. The community contains a well equipped community center as well as a popular country-style diner, both of which are well used community gathering sites. Silver Water has an all volunteer fire dept. servicing the Robinson township consisting of 1 pumper and 2 tankers. This helps in keeping the residents homeowners insurance rates down.

It is native to southeast Brazil and is part of the section Baursia. In fact, it is the type species of this section. It has long lance-shaped leaves that point upwards with a large predominant midvein. The midvein is used to store water for periods of drought that occur during the dry season. Along the midvein there are small red glands that produce a clear sap that results in a freckled-look on both sides of the leaves. The leaves themselves can grow to almost a meter long with a width of about 10 cm. Also, the plant has a climbing growth habit. The aerial roots of the plant are red when they first begin growing and later turn a dark brown with age. The spadix of Philodendron crassinervium gets to about 20‚Äì25 cm long and is covered by a spathe that is white with shades of a dark red towards the bottom where the spadix emerges.

(includes 12 photographs from 2002) In an era before widespread adoption of transistors and before the invention of integrated circuits, car radios were not standard equipment in all vehicles. The few radios installed in vehicles were of vacuum tube design and power-hungry by modern standards. A series of poles in the car park of the nine-acre site were therefore deployed to hold loudspeakers so that viewers could hear the movie. Illuminated neon sign at the 66 Drive-in When television became a rival to cinema in the 1950s, movie studios went to widescreen format to differentiate their product from broadcast TV; the drive-in's screen was widened sometime after 1953 to accommodate the change in format.

The battles at Gallipoli, some of whose participating soldiers are buried at this cemetery, was an eight-month campaign fought by Commonwealth and French forces against Turkish forces in an attempt to force Turkey out of the war, to relieve the deadlock of the Western Front (France/Belgium) and to open a supply route to Russia through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea. The main landings were in April 1915, but failure to make any progress led to a further landing at Suvla Bay to the North of the existing Allied positions on 6 August. However indecision and confusion led delays allowing the Turkish defenders to reinforce their positions, resulting in a stalemate. Hill 60 was a low Turkish occupied knoll 60 metres above sea level at the northern end of the Sari Bair range which nevertheless dominated the Allied positions near Suvla bay. It was the location of the Battle of Hill 60, the last major assault of the campaign, launched on 21 August 1915 to coincide with the attack on Scimitar Hill made from the Suvla front by General Stopford's British IX Corps. The battle lasted for 8 days, and although Australian troops reached the top of the hill the vital north facing slopes which overlooked Suvla remained in Turkish hands. The cemetery, on the site of some of the trenches fought over during the battle, was used following the battle and extensively enlarged after the Armistice from remains found on the surrounding battlefield and from 42 graves moved in from Norfolk Trench Cemetery. 712 of the graves are unidentified, but special memorials commemorate 34 casualties thought to be amongst them. The cemetery also contains one of four memorials commemorating New Zealand troops who do not have known graves, the Hill 60 (New Zealand) Memorial, and contains the names of 183 New Zealand soldiers killed during the battle.

The top of the -shaped cross section serves as a flange or compression member in resisting compressive stresses. The web (vertical section) of the beam below the compression flange serves to resist shear stress and to provide greater separation for the coupled forces of bending. The T-beam has a big disadvantage compared to an I-beam (with shape) because it has no bottom flange with which to deal with tensile forces. One way to make a T-beam more efficient structurally is to use an inverted T-beam with a floor slab or bridge deck joining the tops of the beams. Done properly, the slab acts as the compression flange. History A T-beam is a structural element able to withstand large loads by resistance in the beam or by internal reinforcements. In some respects, the T-beam dates back to the first time a human formed a bridge with a pier and a deck. After all, a T-beam is, in one sense, no more than a pillar with a horizontal bed on top, or, in the case of the inverted T-beam, on the bottom. The upright portion carrying the tension of the beam is termed a web or stem, and the horizontal part that carries the compression is termed a flange. However, the materials used have changed over the years but the basic structure is the same. {T-beams structures such as highway overpasses, buildings and parking garages, have extra material added on the underside where the web joins the flange to reduce the T-beam‚Äôs vulnerability to shear stress. However, when one investigates more deeply into the design of T-beams, some distinctions appear. Designs The T-beam, though simple in design, contains multiple design elements of interest. Unlike an I-beam, a T-beam lacks a bottom flange, which carries savings in terms of materials, but at the loss of resistance to tensile forces. In parking garages, however, this lack of a bottom flange on a T-beam serves as an advantage in that the stem rests on shelf making the flange the upper deck. T- beam designs come in many sizes, lengths and widths depending on what the structure is and its compression tension needs. However, the simplicity of the T-beam is in question by some who would rightly test more than one complex structure; for example, a group of researchers tested pretension inverted T-beams with circular web openings, with mixed but generally favorable results. Thus, in some cases, the extra time and effort invested in creating a more complex structure proves worthwhile. A simpler matter to consider is that of which material or materials make up the construction of T-beams. Materials=Steel T-beams Steel T-beams manufacturing process includes: hot rolling, extrusion, plate welding and pressure fitting. A process of large rollers connecting two steel plates by pinching them together called pressure fitting is a common process for non-load bearing beams. The reality is that for most roadways and bridges today, it is more practical to bring concrete into the design as well. Most T-beam construction is not with steel or concrete alone, but rather with the composite of the two, namely, reinforced concrete. Though the term could refer to any one of a number of means of reinforcement, generally, the definition is limited to concrete poured around rebar. This shows that in considering materials available for a task, engineers need to consider the possibility that no one single material is adequate for the job; rather, combining multiple materials together may be the best solution. Thus, steel and concrete together can prove ideal. Reinforced concrete T-beams Concrete alone is brittle and thus overly subject to the shear stresses a T-beam faces where the web and flange meet. This is the reason that steel is combined with concrete in T-beams. A problem of shear stress can lead to failures of flanges detaching from webs when under load. This could prove catastrophic if allowed to occur in real life; hence, the very real need to mitigate that possibility with reinforcement for concrete T-beams. In such composite structures, many questions arise as to the particulars of the design, including what the ideal distribution of concrete and steel might be: ‚ÄúTo evaluate an objective function, a ratio of steel to concrete costs is necessary‚Äù. This demonstrates that for all aspects of the design of composite T-beams, equations are made only if one has adequate information. Still, there are aspects of design that some may not even have considered, such as the possibility of using external fabric-based reinforcement, as described by Chajes et al., who say of their tested beams, ‚ÄúAll the beams failed in shear and those with composite reinforcement displayed excellent bond characteristics. For the beams with external reinforcement, increases in ultimate strength of 60 to 150 percent were achieved‚Äù. When it comes to resistance to shear forces, external reinforcement is a valid option to consider. Thus, overall, the multiple important aspects of T-beam design impress themselves upon the student of engineering. Issues An issue with the T-beam compared to the I-beam is the lack of the bottom flange. In addition, this makes the beam not as versatile because of the weaker side not having the flange making it have less tensile strength. Concrete beams are often poured integrally with the slab, forming a much stronger ‚Äìshaped beam. These beams are very efficient because the slab portion carries the compressive loads and the reinforcing bars placed at the bottom of the stem carry the tension. A T-beam typically has a narrower stem than an ordinary rectangular beam. These stems are typically spaced from 4‚Äô-0‚Äù apart to more than 12‚Äô-0‚Äù. The slab portion above the stem is designed as a one-way slab spanning between stems. Double-T beams A double-T beam or double tee beam is a load-bearing structure that resemble two T-beams connected to each other. Double tees are manufactured from prestressed concrete using pretensioning beds of about to long. The strong bond of the flange (horizontal section) and the two webs (vertical members) creates a structure that is capable of withstanding high loads while having a long span. The typical sizes of double tees are up to for flange width, up to for web depth and up to or more for span length.

The theorem was obtained by Alexander Kurosh, a Russian mathematician, in 1934.Alexander Kurosh, Die Untergruppen der freien Produkte von beliebigen Gruppen. Mathematische Annalen, vol. 109 (1934), pp. 647‚Äì660. Informally, the theorem says that every subgroup of a free product is itself a free product of a free group and of its intersections with the conjugates of the factors of the original free product. History and generalizations After the original 1934 proof of Kurosh, there were many subsequent proofs of the Kurosh subgroup theorem, including proofs of Harold W. Kuhn (1952),Harold W. Kuhn. Subgroup theorems for groups presented by generators and relations. Annals of Mathematics (2), 56 (1952), 22‚Äì46 Saunders Mac Lane (1958)Saunders Mac Lane, A proof of the subgroup theorem for free products, Mathematika, 5 (1958), 13‚Äì19 and others. The theorem was also generalized for describing subgroups of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions.Abraham Karrass and Donald Solitar, The subgroups of a free product of two groups with an amalgamated subgroup. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 150 (1970), pp. 227‚Äì255.Abraham Karrass and Donald Solitar, Subgroups of HNN groups and groups with one defining relation. Canadian Journal of Mathematics, 23 (1971), 627‚Äì643. Other generalizations include considering subgroups of free pro- finite products and a version of the Kurosh subgroup theorem for topological groups.Peter Nickolas, A Kurosh subgroup theorem for topological groups. Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society (3), 42 (1981), no. 3, 461‚Äì477. In modern terms, the Kurosh subgroup theorem is a straightforward corollary of the basic structural results of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory about groups acting on trees.Daniel E. Cohen. Combinatorial group theory: a topological approach. London Mathematical Society Student Texts, 14. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989. ; 0-521-34936-2 Statement of the theorem Let G = A*B be the free product of groups A and B and let H \\\\le G be a subgroup of G. Then there exist a family (A_i)_{i\\\\in I} of subgroups A_i \\\\le A, a family (B_j)_{j\\\\in J} of subgroups B_j \\\\le B, families g_i, i\\\\in I and f_j, j\\\\in J of elements of G, and a subset X\\\\subseteq G such that :H=F(X)*(*_{i\\\\in I} g_i A_ig_i^{-1})* (*_{j\\\\in J} f_jB_jf_j^{-1}). This means that X freely generates a subgroup of G isomorphic to the free group F(X) with free basis X and that, moreover, giAigi‚àí1, fjBjfj‚àí1 and X generate H in G as a free product of the above form. There is a generalization of this to the case of free products with arbitrarily many factors.William S. Massey, Algebraic topology: an introduction, Graduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1977, ; pp. 218-225 Its formulation is: If H is a subgroup of ‚àói‚ààIGi = G, then :H=F(X)*(*_{j\\\\in J} g_jH_jg_j^{-1}), where X ‚äÜ G and J is some index set and gj ‚àà G and each Hj is a subgroup of some Gi. Proof using Bass‚ÄìSerre theory The Kurosh subgroup theorem easily follows from the basic structural results in Bass‚ÄìSerre theory, as explained, for example in the book of Cohen (1987): Let G = A‚àóB and consider G as the fundamental group of a graph of groups Y consisting of a single non-loop edge with the vertex groups A and B and with the trivial edge group. Let X be the Bass‚ÄìSerre universal covering tree for the graph of groups Y. Since H ‚â§ G also acts on X, consider the quotient graph of groups Z for the action of H on X. The vertex groups of Z are subgroups of G-stabilizers of vertices of X, that is, they are conjugate in G to subgroups of A and B. The edge groups of Z are trivial since the G-stabilizers of edges of X were trivial. By the fundamental theorem of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory, H is canonically isomorphic to the fundamental group of the graph of groups Z. Since the edge groups of Z are trivial, it follows that H is equal to the free product of the vertex groups of Z and the free group F(X) which is the fundamental group (in the standard topological sense) of the underlying graph Z of Z. This implies the conclusion of the Kurosh subgroup theorem. Extension The result extends to the case that G is the amalgamated product along a common subgroup C, under the condition that H meets every conjugate of C only in the identity element.

History of study  Dasyceps was originally named in 1850 for the type species, D. bucklandi, which honors English paleontologist William Buckland, but under the now defunct genus \\"Labyrinthodon,\\" which is now regarded as a junior synonym of the Triassic capitosaur Mastodonsaurus. The new genus name for the species was created by Thomas Huxley in 1859. A detailed description of the taxon was given in German by the German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1910. The most recent description is that of Paton (1975). A second species from Texas, D. microphthalmus, was originally named as a species of Zatrachys but was moved to Dasyceps by Paton (1975).  Anatomy  Dasyceps is the largest of the three zatracheidid genera, with a skull length approaching 30 cm. It is diagnosed by the following features: (1) proportionately long, U-shaped skull and elongate premaxillae; (2) relatively posteriorly situated nares; (3) dorsal exposure of septomaxilla replaced by nasal and maxilla, which contact posterior to the naris, excluding the lacrimal; (4) quadratojugal expanded but without spikes; (5) tabular posteriorly expanded; (6) long suture between squamosal and tabular. Compared to other zatracheidids, the internarial fontanelle of D. bucklandi forms a nearly perfect teardrop-shaped opening that divides the nasals more than in Acanthostomatops but that does not divide the frontals as is found in Zatrachys. Dasyceps bucklandi is only known from a holotype skull split into a part and counterpart block. Dasyceps microphthalmus is known from the holotype and two referred specimens.

He was born in Cartago, Costa Rica, the son of Jos√© Mar√≠a de Peralta y La Vega and Ana Benita de Nava L√≥pez del Corral. Peralta attended the University of Le√≥n and was ordained as a pastor in Le√≥n, Nicaragua in 1812. He was named a parish priest for the village Olocuilta, El Salvador. In 1822, Costa Rica elected Peralta to represent it in the First Constituent Congress of the Mexican Empire, but he did not attend the Congress, because he did not receive instruction from the municipal council of Cost Rican until September, too late to arrive before Iturbide abolished the Congress in October. In 1825, he was elected Deputy for Costa Rica to the Congress of the Federal Republic of Central America, a post which he held until 1826, during which he participated in the legislation of several important laws, including the annexation of the Partido de Nicoya to Costa Rica. From 1827 to 1828 Peralta was a Deputy for Ujarr√°s in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Costa Rica, and in November, 1829, he was elected to represent Costa Rica in the Senate of the Federal Republic of Central America. From 1832 to 1833 he was the Deputy for Santa Cruz, Costa Rica in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Costa Rica. Peralta served as President of the Assembly from September 1832 to February 1833 and from July 1833 to September 1833. In 1835, Peralta participated in the Costa Rican civil war, the Guerra de la Liga () against Head of State Braulio Carrillo Colina. For this reason, his property was seized by the state and he had to flee in exile. Peralta had been an enthusiastic admirer of General Francisco Moraz√°n Quesada, who he honored during the general's stay in Cartago, Costa Rica in 1834. Peralta was one of the most prominent supporters of the government of General Francisco Moraz√°n, who rose to power on 12 April 1842. As a result, Peralta was elected Deputy for Cartago to the Constituent Assembly convened by Moraz√°n, which began on 10 July 1842 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. Peralta was named President of the Assembly. Among the legislative projects that he pushed were the creation of the college San Luis Gozaga in Cartago, which would not actually open until 1869. Peralta died in Cartago on 16 September 1844, after an accident riding a horse. He left an important bequest for the foundation of a school for the children of Cartago, an institution which retains his name today. In the city a bust in honor of Peralta was unveiled in 1917.

History of study  Zatrachys was named by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878 for the type species, Z. serratus, based on a partial skull from the early Permian of Texas. Additional material has been reported from the early Permian of New Mexico and Oklahoma. Urban et al. (2007) reported material attributed to Z. serratus from the late Carboniferous and the early Permian of West Virginia. This is the only record of Zatrachys in the Carboniferous. Zatrachys microphthalmus is now placed within Dasyceps.  Anatomy  Like all zatracheidids, Zatrachys is easily recognized by the presence of a large opening in the snout, the internarial fontanelle or fenestra. Of the three genera of zatracheidids, that of Zatrachys is the largest, extending as far back as to fully divide the nasals and to partially divide the frontals, a unique feature (autapomorphy). Other features that distinguish this genus are the presence of prominent spiky projections from the posterior skull (maxilla and quadratojugal), bosses and ridges on the lower jaw, a supratemporal that borders the otic notch, long and slender tabular horns and short postparietal horns, contact between the palatine and the vomer to fully enclose the choana on the palate, and a U-shaped skull profile intermediate to that of Acanthostomatops (broad and parabolic) and Dasyceps (elongate). Although there are numerous reports of postcranial material attributed to Zatrachys, all of this was referred to species that are now reassigned to other temnospondyl taxa (e.g., \\"Zatrachys crucifer\\") or material of other taxa that was mistakenly attributed to cranial material of Z. serratus due to close proximity during preservation (e.g., Platyhystrix). This often led to hypothesized close relationships with Platyhystrix in particular.

Early life and family  Born in 1600 in Granada, Nicaragua, he was the son of Juan de Obreg√≥n, cavalry captain of the city of Granada, and Isabel de Espinosa. He married Ana de Obando, daughter of Bernardino de Obando and Juana G√≥mez. He died in Nicaragua.  Career  He served twice as mayor of the city of Granada. In 1647 he became alderman of the Nicaraguan city of Le√≥n. From 1663 to 1664 he was mayor of Nicoya, succeeding Lorenzo de la Madriz Paniagua in that position. On May 26, 1664, he was appointed Acting Governor of Costa Rica by General Mart√≠n Carlos de Mencos y Arbizu, president of the Audiencia of Guatemala, replacing Don Rodrigo Arias Maldonado y G√≥ngora, who at the same time, at the direction of Mencos y Arbizu, took over Obreg√≥n y Espinosa's position as mayor of Nicoya. Obreg√≥n y Espinosa assumed the role of Acting Governor on August 11, 1664, and held it until June 29, 1665, when he was replaced by Don Juan Lopez de la Flor y Reinoso, who had been appointed Governor by King Don Felipe IV on August 10, 1663. During his brief tenure, the Adelantado de Costa Rica Don Juan Fernandez de Salinas and Captain Juan de Vidamartel registered some mining deposits in area called Las C√≥ncavas, which was located one league from the city of Cartago, and another in a ravine in the valley of Aserr√≠, in the hill of the Coyotes, but they were not productive. Upon stepping down from the role of Acting Governor, Obreg√≥n y Espinosa was again named mayor of Nicoya, a position he held until 1672.

Cocoa harvesting in Cameroon Ivory Coast (C√¥te d'Ivoire) leads the world in production and export of the cocoa beans used in the manufacture of chocolate, , supplying 38% of cocoa produced in the world. West Africa collectively supplies two thirds of the world's cocoa crop, with Ivory Coast leading production at 1.8 million tonnes , and nearby Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Togo producing additional 1.55 million tonnes. Ivory Coast overtook Ghana as the world's leading producer of cocoa beans in 1978, and today is highly dependent on the crop, which accounts for 40% of national export income. The primary non-African competitor of Ivory Coast is Indonesia, which went from having almost nonexistent domestic cocoa industry in the 1970s to becoming one of the largest producers in the market by the early 2000s. According to the UN FAO, Indonesia overtook Ghana and became the second- largest producer worldwide in 2006. (World Cocoa Foundation provides significantly lower figures for Indonesia, but concurs that it is the largest producer of cocoa beans outside West Africa.) Large chocolate producers such as Cadbury, Hershey's, and Nestle buy Ivorian cocoa futures and options through Euronext whereby world prices are set. Tree Cocoa pods in varying levels of ripeness growing on the trunk of a tree (cauliflory). Theobroma cacao is shade-loving tree native to the understory of rainforests, growing at low elevation in the foothills of the Andes, and the great South American equatorial river basins the Amazon River Basin, and the Orinoco River Basin. The tree is a choice crop for areas of Zulu with low to slight elevations, good soils, and the constant humidity of the tropics. Farming and Production Cocoa bean output in 2012 The crop is grown in Ivory Coast mostly by smallholder farmers planting on 1-3 hectares. The pods containing the beans are harvested when a sufficient number are ripe, opened to separate the seeds and pulp from the outer rind, and the seeds and pulp are usually allowed to ferment somewhere on the farm, before the seeds are dried in a central location. The dried seeds are purchased by a traitant or buyer who travels among villages in an area to weigh, purchase and collect the crop. The traitant then takes the crop to a short-holding warehouse in a major town or city where the major exporters purchase the seeds and arrange for its export from Ivory Coast. The entire process requires the labored contribution of a variety of workers, from the farmer who owns the fields, to his laborers who may be family members (in most cases), to others in the village who harvest pods to ferment seeds at the same time, to the local buyers, and the middlemen between these purchasers and the exporters who finally get the crop to an export ship. With some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, primarily Ghana and Ivory Coast, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018. However, international attempts to improve conditions for children were failing because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor. Child labour in cocoa production Ivory Coast and other West African cocoa producing nations have come under severe criticism in the west for using child slave labor to produce the cocoa purchased by Western chocolate companies. The bulk of the criticism has been directed towards practices in Ivory Coast. The report \\"A Taste of Slavery: How Your Chocolate May be Tainted\\" claims that traffickers promise paid work, housing, and education to children who are then forced to labour and undergo severe abuse, that some children are held forcibly on farms and work up to 100 hours per week, and that attempted escapees are beaten. A BBC article claimed that 15,000 children from Mali, some under age 11, were working as slaves in cocoa production in Ivory Coast, and Mali's Save the Children Fund director described \\"young children carrying 6kg of cocoa sacks so heavy that they have wounds all over their shoulders.\\" In 2001 Chocolate Manufacturers Association acknowledged that slaves harvested some cocoa. In 2013, the U.S. DOL's report Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in C√¥te d'Ivoire stated that 39.8% of children aged 5 to 14 are working children and that they \\"are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in agriculture, particularly on cocoa farms, sometimes under conditions of forced labor.\\" In December 2014, the DOL's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor mentioned Ivory Coast among the countries where instances of such working conditions (both child labor and forced labor) are still observed. A major study of the issue in 2016, published in Fortune in the U.S., concluded that approximately 2.1 million children in various countries of West Africa \\"still do the dangerous and physically taxing work of harvesting cocoa\\". The report was doubtful as to whether the situation can be improved. \\"According to the 2015 edition of the Cocoa Barometer, a biennial report examining the economics of cocoa that‚Äôs published by a consortium of nonprofits, the average farmer in Ghana in the 2013‚Äì14 growing season made just 84¬¢ per day, and farmers in Ivory Coast a mere 50¬¢. That puts them well below the World Bank‚Äôs new $1.90 per day standard for extreme poverty, even if you factor in the 13% rise in the price of cocoa last year. And in that context the challenge of eradicating child labor feels immense, and the chocolate companies‚Äô newfound commitment to expanding the investments in cocoa communities not quite sufficient. ... 'Best-case scenario, we‚Äôre only doing 10% of what‚Äôs needed.' Getting that other 90% won‚Äôt be easy. 'It‚Äôs such a colossal issue,' says Sona Ebai, the former secretary general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries. 'I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it‚Äôs the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you really need leadership.'\\" In April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer 2018 report on the $100-billion industry, said this about the child labor situation in West Africa: \\"Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sectorwide objective of the elimination of child labour, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labour by 2020\\". A report later that year by New Food Economy stated that the Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation Systems implemented by the International Cocoa Initiative and its partners has been useful, but \\"they are currently reaching less than 20 percent of the over two million children impacted\\".http://www.cacao.gouv.ci/index.php?rubrique=1.1.6&langue;=en Pests *Cacao swollen shoot virus *Phytophthora megakarya References Category:Agriculture in Ivory Coast Category:Cocoa production Category:Chocolate industry ","title":"Cocoa production in Ivory Coast"},{"id":"18694060","title":"List of solar eclipses in the 20th century"},{"id":"18694063","text":"Luis Diego S√°enz Carazo (June 21, 1836, Cartago, Costa Rica ‚Äì April 8, 1895, San Jos√©) was a Costa Rican politician. https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Diego_S√°enz_Carazo S√°enz Carazo was member of the Constituent assembly of 1871.

He is known as the author of the Costa Rica's national anthem. He was an orphan from a young age, since his mother died at childbirth and his father died when he was very young. He was raised by two of his aunts, both his father's sisters, with a low money income. This is why he only went through the first year in the Liceo de Costa Rica. Shortly after that, he had to work for a living. In 1892 he began to work as a typewriter in the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica (Corte Suprema de Justicia), position that helped him become a journalist. His first articles were published in 1898 in El Diarito (The Little Diary), and since then until 1948 he wrote in all major newspapers and magazines in Costa Rica. On December 24, 1899 he married his cousin Ester Venegas Zeled√≥n. They had five children. When he was 27 years old, he participated in a competition to give lyrics to the National Anthem, which already had music that was composed by Manuel Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez. He took the first prize and the lyrics persist since 1903. He wrote two books for children: Jardin para Ni√±os (Garden For Children) in 1916 and Alma Infantil (Childlike Soul) in 1928. His other books Campo de Batalla (Battlefield) and Germinal were burned before they were published. He earned his livelihood and his family's by working in accounting for diverse institutions and enterprises. From 1914 to 1917 he was the director of the National Printing press: from 1917 to 1924 he was the administrator of the Botica Francesa (French Drugstore).

That year he began to work in the Contraloria de Hospitales until 1940, year when he went to live to Puntarenas as Audit of the Compa√±ia Atunera until 1944. In 1946 he was named General Secretary of Hospital San Juan de Dios, a position he had until 1949. In 1948, during the Costa Rican Civil War he was sent to jail and seriously battered. In 1949 he supported the creation of the Unidad Nacional party and worked in the Constituent Assembly as a representative of the party. In that time, his health was very delicate and he couldn't go back to the Assembly, for which he decided to retire to his property \\"La Pastora\\" (The Shepherd) in Esparza.

The parties involved were Sima Yi and Cao Shuang, who were both regents for the Cao Wei emperor Cao Fang, who was then about 17 years old. On that day, while Cao Shuang and his brothers accompanied the emperor on a visit to the Gaoping tombs, Sima Yi staged a coup d'√©tat; taking control of the capital city of Luoyang and issuing a memorial which listed out the various crimes Cao Shuang had committed. Cao Shuang surrendered and gave up his powers after further receiving reassurance that he and his family would be spared, thinking that he could still live a life in luxury. Shortly thereafter, Cao Shuang, his brothers, and his supporters were charged with treason and executed along with their families on 9 February. The coup d'√©tat increased the Sima family's influence and paved the way for the eventual replacement of the Cao Wei regime by the Sima family's Jin dynasty in 266. Background In 239, the Cao Wei emperor Cao Rui died and was succeeded by his seven-year-old adopted son, Cao Fang. Before his death, Cao Rui named General-in-Chief Cao Shuang and Grand Commandant Sima Yi as the regents to assist Cao Fang. Cao Shuang wanted to dominate the Wei government so he used a series of political manoeuvres to consolidate and concentrate power in the hands of himself, his brothers Cao Xi (ÊõπÁæ≤) and Cao Xun (ÊõπË®ì), and their supporters. He heeded the advice of He Yan, Deng Yang and Ding Mi (‰∏ÅË¨ê), and relocated Empress Dowager Guo (Cao Rui's widow) to Yongning Palace (Ê∞∏ÂØßÂÆÆ) so that she could not interfere in politics. He also put his brothers in command of the military, promoted his close aides to higher positions in the imperial court, and made changes to the political structure to benefit himself and his clique. Sima Yi tried to stop Cao Shuang but failed to do so. Cao Shuang became increasingly distrustful and wary of Sima Yi.(ÊõπÁàΩÁî®‰ΩïÊôè„ÄÅÈÑßÈ¢∫„ÄÅ‰∏ÅË¨ê‰πãË¨ÄÔºåÈÅ∑Â§™ÂêéÊñºÊ∞∏ÂØßÂÆÆÔºåÂ∞àÊìÖÊúùÊîøÔºåÂÖÑÂºü‰∏¶ÂÖ∏Á¶ÅÂÖµÔºåÂ§öÊ®πË¶™Èª®ÔºåÂ±¢ÊîπÂà∂Â∫¶„ÄÇÂ∏ù‰∏çËÉΩÁ¶ÅÔºåÊñºÊòØËàáÁàΩÊúâÈöô„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 1.

In April or May 248, Zhang Dang (ÂºµÁï∂), a palace eunuch, illegally transferred 11 women out of the imperial harem and presented them to Cao Shuang to be his concubines. Cao Shuang and his close aides thought that Sima Yi was seriously ill and could no longer do anything, so they plotted with Zhang Dang to overthrow the emperor Cao Fang and put Cao Shuang on the throne.

Cao Shuang secretly instructed him to check if Sima Yi was as ill as he claimed, so Li Sheng visited Sima Yi before leaving for Jing Province. Sima Yi knew the true purpose of Li Sheng's visit, so he pretended to be frail and feeble. Li Sheng saw that Sima Yi could not move around and wear clothes without help from his servants, and could not even consume congee without soiling his clothes. He then told Sima Yi, \\"Everyone thought that your illness was a minor one; alas, who expected you to be in such poor health?\\" Sima Yi pretended to cough and pant as he replied, \\"I'm old and sick and I'm going to die soon.

The coup d'√©tat On 5 February 249, Cao Shuang and his brothers accompanied the emperor Cao Fang on a visit to the Gaoping Tombs (È´òÂπ≥Èôµ) to pay respect to the late emperor and Cao Fang's father, Cao Rui. On that day, Sima Yi seized the opportunity to stage a coup d'√©tat against his co-regent. He went to Yongning Palace to meet Empress Dowager Guo and ask her to remove Cao Shuang and his brothers from power. In the meantime, he ordered his eldest son Sima Shi to lead his troops to the palace gates. After meeting the empress dowager, Sima Yi went to the camp where Cao Shuang's troops were based. Yan Shi (Âö¥‰∏ñ), one of Cao Shuang's subordinates, prepared to fire an arrow at Sima Yi but his colleague Sun Qian (Â≠´Ë¨ô) stopped him and said, \\"We wouldn't know what will happen.\\" This process repeated three times.(ÂòâÂπ≥ÂÖÉÂπ¥Êò•Ê≠£ÊúàÁî≤ÂçàÔºåÂ§©Â≠êË¨ÅÈ´òÂπ≥ÈôµÔºåÁàΩÂÖÑÂºüÁöÜÂæû„ÄÇÊòØÊó•ÔºåÂ§™ÁôΩË•≤Êúà„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊñºÊòØÂ•èÊ∞∏ÂØßÂ§™ÂêéÂª¢ÁàΩÂÖÑÂºü„ÄÇÊôÇÊôØÂ∏ùÁÇ∫‰∏≠Ë≠∑ËªçÔºåÂ∞áÂÖµÂ±ØÂè∏È¶¨ÈñÄ„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂàóÈô£Èóï‰∏ãÔºåÁ∂ìÁàΩÈñÄ„ÄÇÁàΩÂ∏≥‰∏ãÁù£Âö¥‰∏ñ‰∏äÊ®ìÔºåÂºïÂº©Â∞áÂ∞ÑÂ∏ùÔºåÂ≠´Ë¨ôÊ≠¢‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∫ãÊú™ÂèØÁü•„ÄÇ„Äç‰∏âÊ≥®‰∏âÊ≠¢ÔºåÁöÜÂºïÂÖ∂ËÇò‰∏çÂæóÁôº„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 1.

Sima Yi, along with Jiang Ji and others, led troops out of Luoyang to the floating bridge above the Luo River, where he sent a memorial to the emperor Cao Fang, listing out Cao Shuang's crimes (e.g. not fulfilling his duty as regent, corrupting the government, conspiring against the throne) and requesting the emperor to remove Cao Shuang and his brothers from their positions of power.(Â∏ùË¶™Â∏•Â§™Â∞âËî£ÊøüÁ≠âÂãíÂÖµÂá∫ËøéÂ§©Â≠êÔºåÂ±Ø‰∫éÊ¥õÊ∞¥ÊµÆÊ©ãÔºå‰∏äÂ•èÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖàÂ∏ùË©îÈôõ‰∏ã„ÄÅ ... ‰º∫ÂØüÈùûÂ∏∏„ÄÇ„Äç) Jin Shu vol. 1. Cao Shuang blocked the memorial from reaching Cao Fang and left the emperor at the south of the Yi River while ordering his men to cut down trees to build anti- cavalry blockades and station about 1,000 troops nearby to guard against Sima Yi's advances. During this time, Huan Fan advised Cao Shuang to bring the emperor to Xuchang, denounce Sima Yi as a traitor, and call on all military forces throughout Wei to attack Sima Yi. Cao Shuang refused to listen to Huan Fan, and that night he sent Xu Yun (Ë®±ÂÖÅ) and Chen Tai to meet Sima Yi. Sima Yi explained to them he only wanted Cao Shuang to surrender and give up his powers. He also sent Yin Damu (Â∞πÂ§ßÁõÆ), whom Cao Shuang highly trusted, to further persuade Cao Shuang to surrender. When Cao Shuang wanted to agree, Huan Fan attempted to stop him but Cao Shuang ultimately did not heed his advice. Cao Shuang said, \\"Sima Yi only wants to take away my powers. I can still return home as a marquis and live in luxury and comfort.\\" Huan Fan could only sigh and thump his chest in frustration. Cao Shuang then let Cao Fang read Sima Yi's memorial and agreed to surrender and relinquish his powers.(ÁàΩ‰∏çÈÄöÂ•èÔºåÁïôËªäÈßïÂÆø‰ºäÊ∞¥ÂçóÔºå‰ºêÊ®πÁÇ∫ÈπøËßíÔºåÁôºÂ±ØÂÖµÊï∏ÂçÉ‰∫∫‰ª•ÂÆà„ÄÇÊ°ìÁØÑÊûúÂã∏ÁàΩÂ•âÂ§©Â≠êÂπ∏Ë®±ÊòåÔºåÁßªÊ™ÑÂæµÂ§©‰∏ãÂÖµ„ÄÇÁàΩ‰∏çËÉΩÁî®ÔºåËÄåÂ§úÈÅ£‰æç‰∏≠Ë®±ÂÖÅ„ÄÅÂ∞öÊõ∏Èô≥Ê≥∞Ë©£Â∏ùÔºåËßÄÊúõÈ¢®Êó®„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊï∏ÂÖ∂ÈÅéÂ§±Ôºå‰∫ãÊ≠¢ÂÖçÂÆò„ÄÇÊ≥∞ÈÇÑ‰ª•Â†±ÁàΩÔºåÂã∏‰πãÈÄöÂ•è„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂèàÈÅ£ÁàΩÊâÄ‰ø°ÊÆø‰∏≠Ê†°Â∞âÂ∞πÂ§ßÁõÆË´≠ÁàΩÔºåÊåáÊ¥õÊ∞¥ÁÇ∫Ë™ìÔºåÁàΩÊÑè‰ø°‰πã„ÄÇÊ°ìÁØÑÁ≠âÊè¥ÂºïÂè§‰ªäÔºåË´´Ë™™Ëê¨Á´Ø„ÄÇÁµÇ‰∏çËÉΩÂæûÔºå‰πÉÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂè∏È¶¨ÂÖ¨Ê≠£Áï∂Ê¨≤Â•™ÂêæÊ¨äËÄ≥„ÄÇÂêæÂæó‰ª•‰æØÈÇÑÁ¨¨Ôºå‰∏çÂ§±ÁÇ∫ÂØåÂÆ∂ÁøÅ„ÄÇ„ÄçÁØÑÊãäËÜ∫Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂùêÂçøÔºåÊªÖÂêæÊóèÁü£ÔºÅ„ÄçÈÅÇÈÄöÂ∏ùÂ•è„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 1.

Once he was out of Luoyang, Huan Fan turned back and told Si Fan, \\"The Imperial Tutor (Sima Yi) is planning to commit treason.

After the coup d'√©tat, Si Fan surrendered himself to Sima Yi and told him what happened earlier. Sima Yi asked, \\"What's the punishment for falsely accusing someone of treason?\\" \\"According to the law, the one who makes the false accusation shall be punished for treason,\\" came the reply.

Wang Ling surrendered and committed suicide later while he was being escorted as a prisoner to Luoyang. Sima Yi had Wang Ling's co-conspirators, including Cao Biao, arrested and executed along with their families.

The Cao family's influence in Wei weakened over time as the Sima family's became stronger. In 266, Sima Zhao's son, Sima Yan, usurped the throne from Cao Huan and replaced the Cao Wei state with the Jin dynasty, with himself as the new emperor.

She married Norris Randall Norton of New York city. He had been an officer in the civil war and died in 1870. Working with Susan B. Anthony, Sarah Norton campaigned for the admission of women at the Cornell University, which she called ‚Äúthat stronghold of feminine prejudice,‚Äù and the two women received the support of its founder, Ezra Cornell. The school admitted women in 1870, one of the first American universities to do so. As a member of the Working Women's Association, she also campaigned for the equality of men and women. In addition to advocating for the education of women, she petitioned for equal opportunity and equal pay in the workplace. She also firmly opposed abortion as stated in her article \\"Tragedy - Social and Domestic\\", published in Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, in which she states that \\"perhaps there will come a time when an unmarried mother will not be despised because of her motherhood‚Ä¶ and when the right of the unborn to be born will not be denied or interfered with.\\"Sarah F.

Agenda Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) was formed in 1977 by W Tod Zechel, Brad Sparks, and Peter Gersten to advocate for the release of information regarding UFOs that has been classified by government organizations through the use of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The organization gained notoriety for the amount of Freedom of Information requests it has made, as well as the subsequent court cases that were a result of them. Since 1998, the organization has been headed by Peter Gerstein. CAUS is a nonprofit organization which stands on the following principles * It is against any and all secrecy relating to contact with all forms of extraterrestrial intelligence * The public has the absolute and unconditional right to know about this contact. Members of CAUS claim that we are ‚ÄúBeing contacted, directly and indirectly by extraterrestrials, and will continue to be contacted at an ever increasing rate as we approach the galactic alignment,‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe presently have the technology and resources to discover the truth about this extraterrestrial contact for ourselves and decipher these messages.‚Äù The organization was most active during the 70s and 80s, but presently does not show any activity.  Key People  Peter Gersten, founder of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, is a criminal defense attorney who is familiar with lawsuits against the U.S. government. In 1977, Gersten brought suit against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) using FOIA and received over nine hundred UFO documents from the CIA in 1979, two years after the suit occurred. However, the CIA, left out fifty-seven documents, due to claims of ‚Äúnational security considerations\\". One year after, on June 24, 1980, Gersten brought a suit against the NSA with his newly formed organization CAUS. On November 18, 1980, due to the NSA's top secret affidavit, the judge was satisfied with the NSA's reasoning to withhold the documents, even though the judge was never cleared to view the top secret information.  History  Citizens Against UFO Secrecy ultimately arose as a result of the renewal of the Freedom of Information Act in 1974. The group was formed by Peter Gersten, W.T. Zechel, and Brad Sparks in the late 1970s and was based in Connecticut. Peter Gerstein, founder of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy was originally involved in a case against the CIA for the Ground Saucer Watch organization; however, CAUS ended up finishing the case, as Ground Saucer Watch ran into financial troubles. CAUS proved that many agencies were covering up their involvement in UFO research by releasing the documents of agencies that claimed to have lost interest in UFO research. For example, the CIA stated that they lost interest in UFOs in 1953. This case against the CIA resulted in the release of over 900 government files on UFOs, many that were later than 1953. CAUS (Plaintiff) vs NSA (Defendant) CAUS's request for further information was denied by the NSA, prompting the organization to sue in order to gain the information. The court case between them was overseen by Federal Judge Gerhart A. Gesell. An affidavit was given by Eugene V Yeats, NSA Office of Policy Chief, regarding why the information requested would not be released. The affidavit says that it is in the NSA's direct interests not to have the documents published, as they are a matter of national security and could compromise the security of the defendant's organization contains sensitive intelligence regarding the interception of foreign communication; and no meaningful amount of information can be declassified without giving foreign intelligence information regarding US time and methods of information interception. Alongside the public affidavit, a top secret affidavit also by Yeats was available to only Judge Gesell. The significance of the top secret affidavit is alluded by Gesell's statement that ‚Äúthe public interest in disclosure is far outweighed by the sensitive nature of the materials and the obvious effect on national security their release may well entail‚Äù. The top secret affidavit was released with 75% of it redacted, and was later re- released with less harsh redactions in 1997 with only about 25%. Though it is speculated the information still redacted is mostly composed of UFO intelligence, the actual information CAUS was interested in.  Publications  The UFO Cover-up: What the Government Won‚Äôt Say written by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood. Originally released titled Clear Intent May 1, 1984. Renamed in 1990. The UFO Cover-up: What the Government Won‚Äôt Say details the Citizens Against UFO Secrecy and their journey towards obtaining government information relating to UFOs, as well as the contents of the files that were released. The authors, Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood, are members of CAUS, which provides a firsthand narrative for the reader. The book contains many details about each and every request for files and the responses, as well as what the responses allowed CAUS to assume. These assumptions are shown to attempt to verify CAUS's belief that the government has proof of the existence of UFOs. Interview and Media Presence Citizens Against UFO Secrecy never held heavy media presence. Their most noticeable spurt in popularity due to their 1980's court case against the NSA. When the NSA presented an affidavit to the judge it cause the case to be dismissed, it sparked the curiosity of Americans on what the affidavit said to sway the judge so heavily. The judge wasn't cleared to learn the top secret information, so the affidavit swayed him without clear evidence of the situation. He nonetheless dropped the case and when the affidavit was released to the public, eighty percent of it was unavailable to read due to the mandatory declassiÔ¨Åcation review (MDR) the document went through. This was used as evidence the government is living in secrecy as the document was barely legible due to most sections being blocked out, leaving only small snippets of non-descript information being left. CAUS used this to their advantage by increasing public pressure on the NSA to declassify UFO documents. Their media presence was at its peak during this time but died down as the situation grew stale.  References  *http://www.v-j-enterprises.com/caus.html *Clark, Jerome. The UFO Encyclopedia.

After the election, which returned a Progressive Conservative government, Stewart was rewarded with the Post of Consul General in Atlanta, Georgia.

Founded in 1882 by George Henry Crowther, Brighton Grammar has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for over 1,400 students from the Early Learning Centre (ELC) to Year 12. The majority of students are drawn from the City of Bayside and surrounding suburbs of Brighton, East Brighton, Elsternwick, Hampton, Sandringham, Beaumaris and Black Rock. The school is affiliated with a number of associations including the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Anglican Schools Network, and the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS). History Brighton Grammar School was founded on 14 February 1882, with eight male students. By 1890, 160 boys were in attendance. During the depression of the 1890s, students numbers declined rapidly. The school founder, George Henry Crowther was headmaster until his death in 1918. His son, Lieutenant Colonel Harry Arnold A. Crowther, subsequently assumed the role. Crowther retired in 1924, when Herbert E. Dixon took over. Dixon expanded the school until his retirement in 1938. Geoffrey G. Green was headmaster until 1942. His successor was Phillip St. John Wilson. In 1958, Brighton Grammar joined the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS), and soon after purchased grounds on the former Brighton Gas Company site, where \\"Wilson House\\", now the Junior School, was to be built to accommodate the growing student numbers. The number of boys reached 800 during the 1960s. From 1967‚Äì1995, Robert Lancelot Rofe was headmaster. He oversaw a period where some new buildings were erected. Michael Spencer Urwin was appointed headmaster at the beginning of 1996. He had previously held the position of deputy headmaster at Brisbane Grammar School, and began his term by implementing a curriculum review, a pastoral care system, and a program of modernisation. This also included community education opportunities in out of school hours in order to make the school more inclusive and less parochial. A new senior school library and resource centre, and specialist classroom facilities have been built to upgrade facilities in the senior school as well as the middle school later on. Affiliations Brighton Grammar School has a close sister school relationship with Firbank Girls' Grammar School, an independent Anglican school for girls. Students of the two schools participate in a range of co-educational activities together. The school also maintains a close relationship with St Andrew's Anglican Church, Brighton. Crowther Centre for Learning and Innovation The Crowther Centre for Learning and Innovation is an organisation run under the auspices of Brighton Grammar School to provide support services for the educational community. House system Brighton Grammar School has six houses: Armstrong (white), Crowther (yellow), Dixon (blue), Hancock (green), Rofe (purple) and School (red). In the 1930s the houses were: Chichester, Ireland, Marshall, Pelham, Smith and Willett, of which Marshall was exclusively for boarders.

In 1901, he graduated with a baccalaureate in humanities with distinction (bachiller en humanidades con Distinci√≥n Un√°nime) from the Liceo de Costa Rica. In 1903, he traveled to Belgium to study at the Le√≥n XII Seminary of the University of Leuven. While in Europe, he also studied at the Saint-Sulpice Seminary of Paris and at the University of Freiburg. In 1906, he graduated magna cum laude in philosophy. In 1909, he was ordained as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. After returning from Europe to Costa Rica, Volio went to Nicaragua to join Augusto C√©sar Sandino's guerilla army, the liberales, in the struggle against the United States occupation of Nicaragua. He achieved the rank of general. Returning to Costa Rica to teach, he was persecuted by the military dictatorship of Federico Tinoco Granados. In 1919, he joined the Sapo√° Revolution against Tinoco's regime. When the revolution failed, Volio made unsuccessful attempts to organize invasions from Panama and Nicaragua to oust the ruling junta. In 1922, Volio was seated in the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica, representing the independence party of San Ram√≥n. In 1923, he founded the Reform Party (Partido Reformista) to fight for the working class and the poor.

Mohandas Gandhi, and Maurice Frydman helped to draft the November Declaration, which handed over rule of Aundh State from the Raja to the residents, and became law in the Swaraj Constitution of Aundh in 1939.Alter, p. 92. The Aundh Experiment was an unusual idea in pre- independence India, where the rulers of princely states were loath to hand over their power.Allen, pp. 314-5.  Development and ratification  At the time, Aundh was a princely state in British India, ruled by generations of Rajas since 1699. Unlike the Provinces of India, which were ruled directly by the British government, the princely states had a certain degree of autonomy‚Äîwith each state making its own treaty with the British Monarch. In 1938, the ruler of Aundh, Raja Bhavanrao Srinivasrao, was approached by Frydman (also known as Swami Bharatananda), a Polish engineer who was a disciple of Gandhi. According to the Raja's son, Apa Pant, \\"Frydman had great influence with my father, and on his seventy-fifth birthday he said, 'Raja Saheb, why don't you go and make a declaration to Mahatma Gandhi that you are giving all power to the people because it will help in the freedom struggle.'\\" Raja Bhavanrao was a strong supporter of the Indian independence movement, and stood up for the welfare of the people of Aundh, \\"in sharp contrast to the attitude and behavior of the majority of Maharajas and Rajas\\", according to Indira Gandhi. The Raja readily endorsed the idea of self-government, Frydman wrote a draft declaration, and the Raja and his son traveled to Wardha to see Gandhi. There, Gandhi dictated the final draft of the constitution, which was sent to the state assembly to be ratified on January 21, 1939.Alter, pp. 92, 94. The Raja was a self-proclaimed nationalist, and the beginning of the experiment in 1938 caused concern among the British rulers, who reprimanded him for being a friend of Gandhi, who they called \\"the rebel against the Raj.\\" In response, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian National Congress offered their support to the Raja.Alter, p. 104. Swaraj, or self-rule, was the foundation of Gandhi's movement for independence from British domination, and included the principles of self-governance and community building.Parel, pp. 48-49. At the inauguration of the constitution, Raja Bhavanrao affirmed Gandhi's ideals of Swaraj, declaring that: > We have to urge the people of Aundh to remember always that government being > control, self government implies self-control and self-sacrifice. In the new > era that is coming to Aundh, and we hope to the whole of our country, the > strong will serve the weak, the wealthy will serve the poor, the learned > will serve the illiterate. Self government without this spirit of service > and sacrifice is bound to decay into some form or other of > exploitation.Alter, pp. 93-94.  After ratification  After ratification, the state of Aundh was reorganized from the ground up, with local administration put in the hands of village panchayats with five elected representatives, voted into office through new voting rights given to all adults. Each panchayat chose a president, who represented them at regional taluka councils. Each taluka council chose a president and two representatives to a Central Assembly presided over by the raja. In spite of the Raja's role as leader of the Assembly, responsibility for regional government was, for all practical purposes, in the hands of the people. The panchayats were given responsibility for all matters relating to education, welfare, justice, water supply, sanitation, construction and maintenance of roads and public buildings, and all other activities relating to the health safety, and social and economic wellbeing of the villagers.Alter, pp. 92- 93. Between 1939 and 1945, twenty- seven new primary schools were established, making more than one per village. In addition, fourteen middle schools and three high schools were built and staffed, with the total number of teachers more than doubling. Adult education also saw a doubling of expenditure.Alter, p. 100. Several Indian National Congress leaders from Maharashtra became actively involved in the Aundh Experiment in the 1940s, including Tatya Shikhare, Annasaheb Sahasrabudhe, and Nana and Bhau Dharmadhikari. When Achutrao Patwardan went into hiding to avoid arrest during the Quit India movement in 1946, he used Aundh villages as his base of operations. He went as far as adopting the language of the Aundh State Constitution, declaring that he and his band of freedom fighters were \\"Prati Sakar\\"‚Äî\\"self-governing and independent of the Central Authority.\\" The Aundh Experiment in village-level self-rule endured until Indian independence in 1947, when all of the princely states were merged into the new Dominion of India.

The image is known due to the Marian apparitions reported in 1973 by Sister Agnes Katsuko Sasagawa in the remote area of Yuzawadai, an outskirt of Akita, Japan. The messages emphasize prayer (especially recitation of the Holy Rosary) and penance in combination with cryptic visions prophesying sacerdotal persecution and heresy within the Catholic Church. The apparitions were unusual in that the weeping statue of the Virgin Mary was broadcast on Japanese national television, and gained further notice with the sudden healing of hearing impairment experienced by Sasagawa after the apparitions.Schroedel, Jenny and Schroedel, John. The Everything Mary Book: The Life and Legacy of the Blessed Mother, 2006 page 137-138 The image also became affiliated with The Lady of All Nations movement, with which the message shares some similarities. The local ordinary of the convent, John Shojiro Ito, Bishop of Niigata (), recognized \\"the supernatural character of a series of mysterious events concerning the statue of the Holy Mother Mary\\" and authorized \\"the veneration of the Holy Mother of Akita\\" within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Niigata in a 1984 pastoral letter. Background For several decades, Sasagawa, originally from a Buddhist family, had encountered many health problems. She was born premature and suffered poor health most of her life. She also had a poorly performed appendix operation and was immobile for over a decade. Her health reportedly improved after drinking water from Lourdes while under the care of a Catholic nun. After going totally deaf, she went to live with the nuns near Akita.Petrisko, Thomas W., Laurentin, Rene, and Fontecchio, Michael J., The Fatima Prophecies: At the Doorstep of the World by 1998 page 172, 174 Apparitions In 1973, Sasagawa reported apparitions, as well as stigmata and a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary which was said to have wept on 101 occasions. The nuns at Yuzawadai also reported stigmata on the statue, as well as on the hands of Sasagawa; the stigmata on the statue supposedly appeared before the tears started, and disappeared after the tears.Those who saw her: apparitions of Mary by Catherine M. Odell 1995 pages 177-193 Sasagawa reported three messages from the Blessed Virgin during 1973, but the statue itself is reported to have continued weeping thereafter. Sasagawa reported that she first heard the statue calling her, and then the first message began. Messages Sasagawa claimed to have started receiving the first of the messages from the Virgin Mary on July 6, 1973. Sasagawa described that when this happened, the statue became illuminated as it acknowledged her stigmata and hearing impairment. She was instructed to recite the prayer of the Handmaids of the Eucharist, which the Virgin Mary said would cure her deafness. The other reported messages ask for the praying of the rosary and to pray Acts of Reparation.Miller, John D., Beads and prayers: the rosary in history and devotion, 2002 page 159 The second message includes the following:\\"Many men in this world afflict the Lord. I desire souls to console Him to soften the anger of the Heavenly Father. I wish, with my Son, for souls who will repair by their suffering and their poverty for the sinners and ingrates.\\" The third message was communicated on October 13, 1973. It was claimed that the statue became animated for an extended period and was witnessed by a number of nuns. The third Our Lady of Akita message is: Medical cures Sasagawa was admitted to the community of the Sisters of Junshin in Nagasaki. She experienced hearing loss in her left ear years earlier; she experienced hearing loss in her right ear for first time in March 1973 at My≈çk≈ç, Niigata. Sasagawa moved into the convent of the Seitai Hoshikai Handmaids of the Holy Eucharist at Yuzawadai on 12 May 1973. The three messages from the statue were \\"perceived by the deaf ears of\\" Sasagawa while she was a novice at the convent. In October 1974, In March 1975, Sasagawa began to \\"experience violent headaches\\" and hearing loss. The diagnoses of two hearing examinations in March 1975 was hearing loss in both ears. Dr. Sawada of the Niigata Rosai Hospital at J≈çetsu, Niigata, verified that she was 'incurably deaf' and issued documents for her to receive a state subsidy. Dr. Arai of the Eye and Ear Division of the Akita Red Cross Hospital also verified her complete deafness. In May 1982, Sasagawa experienced a sudden improvement in hearing. In June 1982, Sawada attested that Sasagawa's hearing was fully restored. According to Yasuda, the hearing improvement noticed during Sasagawa's 1982 hearing examination was not certified as a \\"miraculous cure\\" by the hospital. On August 4, 1981, a Korean woman with a terminal brain tumor was miraculously cured after friends and relatives prayed for the intercession of Our Lady of Akita. Her name is Teresa Chun Sun Ho. She received visions of Mary related to the Akita events during her recovery, the first while comatose. Her disease was diagnosed and the subsequent cure verified by medical professionals in South Korea.Fukushima, Francis Mutsuo, \\"Akita: Mother of God as CoRedemptrix Modern Miracles of Holy Eucharist\\" (Queenship Publishing, Santa Barbara, California, 83-93) Yasuda wrote that according to Chun and other October 1983 Korean pilgrims, Chun's cure \\"had been declared miraculous by Church authorities of Korea\\". Stigmata Sasagawa \\"claimed to have had a stigmatic-like experience.\\" Her left hand developed bleeding marks. Yasuda wrote that in June 1973 \\"in the center of palm were two red scratches in the form of a cross\\" which seemed to have \\"been engraved in the skin\\" and began to bleed a few days later. \\"There were two red traces in the form of a cross and they seemed to cause pain,\\" according to one nun. According to Sasagawa's account, the stigmata emerged after she began seeing supernatural beings, which appeared to be angels, and two incidents where she felt piercing pain in the palm of her hand. When the wound appeared in her hand, there were several explanations proposed, including the theory of ectoplasmic capability, although theologians said that the stigmata on the Sasagawa and the statue's hands were meant as signs. Weeping statue The palm of the statue's right hand oozed a liquid from two short intersecting lines. It was described as \\"a blackish mark,\\" by one nun; \\"one would have said that it had been traced with a fine point of a pencil.\\" \\"One would have said that they were traced by a pen with black ink,\\" according to a second nun. \\"On these lines there stood out two darker points. It resembled very much ink which had spread under the effect of heat. I said to myself that the Novice Mistress must have spoken of these points when she saw blood flow through a hole as large as that of a needle.\\" A third nun, who had been the sacristan, described that she \\"saw in the middle of the palm of the right hand that a wound in the form of a cross had been cut with something like the tip of a blade.\\" TV Tokyo Channel 12 videotaped the weeping statue in December 1973. The blood type of the statue and its sweat and tear type were found to be types B and AB, respectively.

This type of volcanic landscape is extremely rough and difficult to traverse. It is characteristic of an arid environment because in more humid climates, lava fields are quickly destroyed by weathering and erosion. While the term describes many xeric places, it is strongly associated with Spanish-speaking countries and the Southwestern United States, where Spanish settlers named this landform.Strahler, A. N., 1970, Introduction to Physical Geography, 2nd ed. John Wiley and Sopns. New York, New York. 486 pp. Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds. (2005) Glossary of Geology (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. Badlands landform The word 'malpa√≠s' in Spanish translates to \\"badland,\\" and this describes the area as being extremely rough and difficult to traverse and unusable for crops. Although a malpa√≠s is often another word for the badlands that form by erosion of sedimentary rocks in the same environment, a malpa√≠s is often associated with such types of lava plain terrain as found in a volcanic field. The geology of malpa√≠s terrain is bare to thin layers of soil over lava with sparse vegetation. The lava fields usually consist of lava tube systems, sinkholes, pyroclastic deposits from cinder cone volcanoes, and  ªa ªƒÅ and pƒÅhoehoe lava flows. The lava tubes can vary from intact caves to partial or completely collapsed passages. The collapsed tubes, sinkholes, and jagged  ªa ªƒÅ surfaces are what make malpa√≠s terrain so difficult to navigate and cultivate, thereby earning their name. Examples El Malpa√≠s National Monument is an example of this landform in New Mexico. Other examples are the Carrizozo Malpa√≠s and Jornada del Muerto Volcano lava plain, in the Tularosa Basin's Jornada del Muerto Desert. The Malpa√≠s de G√º√≠mar is an example in the Spanish Canary Islands. Etymology A loanword from Spanish, malpa√≠s is in wide use in English in the southwest United States.

McNamara was the reliable servant in goal for Galway for several years. It was the time when a Galway match wouldn‚Äôt be a Galway match without a McNamara save of blinding quality. Unfortunately it was also the time of a barren spell for the Galway team. That barren spell seemed to turn around with a first Connacht title in 8 years in 1995 and a narrow semi-final defeat to Tyrone but Mayo seemed to halt any revival that Galway were planning when they reached the next two All-Ireland finals, both at Galway's expense in Connacht. As the 98 championship approached, retirement from inter-county football was a serious prospect for McNamara. He considered such a thought after playing a key role in Corofin's All-Ireland Club Championship winning team of 1998 but decided to continue for the time being. It would be a decision he would never regret. John O'Mahony had taken over the reins of Galway football from Val Daly in 97 and was to take Galway through their most successful period since the famous \\"Three In A Row\\" era. They defeated Mayo in the first round of the Connacht SFC and extended Leitrim a similar courtesy in the semi-final. In the final, they played Roscommon on 13 July in a rainy day at Tuam Stadium. McNamara made crucial saves throughout the game and Galway forced a replay with a late Niall Finnegan free. Galway won the replay after extra time by 1-17 to 0-17. They were a step above Derry in the semi-final and not even a late penalty could ruin the day as Galway won by 0-16 to 1-08. In the final, they met a Kildare side who had bet the 1995, 1996, and the 1997 All-Ireland champions in their road to Croke Park. Kildare frustrated Galway in the first half and led by 1-05 to 0-05. However, Galway turned thing around in the 2nd half to win their 8th All-Ireland title, 1-14 to 1-10. For McNamara it had completed a unique double of club and county All- Ireland success. McNamara was named in the Goalkeeper slot for the 1998 All- Stars, confirming his status as best Goalkeeper in the country that year. Galway looked to repeat their success in 1999 but Mayo gained revenge for the defeat in 98 by defeating Galway in the Connacht final at Tuam. Soon after Galway‚Äôs defeat in the Connacht final, McNamara decided to call it a day, again, but decided to have one final crack ath the title in 2000. In 2000, Galway defeated New York, Sligo and Leitrim on their way to another Connacht title. In the semi-final, they faced Kildare with the 98 decider fresh in their minds but Galway finished strongly to qualify for another All-Ireland final. Galway met Kerry in the final and after a poor start, Galway had kept Kerry to six points for the final 50 minutes. However they were unable to strike the winning score and the final finished level, 0-14 each. In the replay, a wonderful goal by Declan Meehan was not enough as Kerry won by 0-17 to 1-10. McNamara finally decided to retire at the age of 34 alongside wife, Josie and daughter Shauna. In recent years, the goalkeeper berth left void by McNamara has been filled by Alan Keane, P√°draig Lally and Brian O'Donoghue. Although current goalkeeper Paul Doherty may be a worthy No.1 for Galway, it is believed that the position hasn't been truly replaced since McNamara retired.

Although it has gills, it is a member of the order Boletales, along with the boletes. It is a coral pink-capped mushroom which appears in pine forests in autumn, always near the related mushroom Suillus bovinus, on which it appears to be parasitic.  Taxonomy  Gomphidius roseus was initially described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus glutinosus Œ≤ roseus in 1821, before he elevated it to species status and gave its current genus and binomial name in 1838. The genus name is derived from the Greek 'Œ≥ŒøŒºœÜŒøœÇ' gomphos meaning \\"plug\\" or \\"large wedge-shaped nail\\". The specific epithet roseus is the Latin adjective \\"pink\\".  Description  The mushroom has a coral-pink cap up to in diameter, though sometimes larger, which is initially convex and later flattens and becomes a more brick-like colour with maturity. Often slimy or sticky as with other members of the genus, its cap lacks the blackish markings of the related G. glutinosus. The stipe is high and 0.4‚Äì1 cm wide and bears an indistinct ring. It is white with a pinkish or wine-coloured tint and often flushed yellow at the base. The whitish flesh may also be tinged pink and has little taste or smell. The decurrent gills are grey, and the spore print is brownish-black.  Distribution and habitat  An uncommon fungus, Gomphidius roseus is found in Europe, but not in North America. A similar pinkish species, G. subroseus occurs in North America. It is found in pine woods, particularly Pinus sylvestris, associated with Suillus bovinus, and is often hidden in undergrowth. Fruiting bodies sprout in the autumn.  Ecology  Like other members of the family Gomphidiaceae, Gomphidius roseus has been thought to be ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationship with their host trees. However, it is found exclusively with the related Jersey cow mushroom (Suillus bovinus), and is now thought to be parasitic upon its mycelium. This is evidenced by microscopic examination, which shows that G. roseus inserts haustoria in plant root cells and does not produce significant mycelium itself. Furthermore, G. roseus is never found growing in isolation, only with S. bovinus though the latter species is found without the former.

Diamond Head=Formation Originally trained as a mechanic,Survivors Classic Rock vol.124, pg59 Tatler is most famous for his first band, Diamond Head. Tatler founded the band along with schoolmate Duncan Scott, playing on a cheap fuzz guitar and Scott on some biscuit tins. They later enrolled the help of Sean Harris and Colin Kimberley on vocals and bass guitar respectively. The band played a few local gigs and recorded two self-financed demo tapes in 1979. Although only recorded in six hours on a four-track (a copy was sent to Geoff Barton from Sounds) they gained enough attention to tour as support with AC/DC and open for Iron Maiden in London. The manager paid for the recording of a 7\\" single (\\"Shoot Out the Lights\\") and released it on Happy Face Records (a label owned by the producer Muff Murfin of The Old Smithy studio of Worcester) Although a few record companies were interested in signing Diamond Head, none were willing to offer a big album deal. The manager decided that they would press a thousand white label copies of their debut album to sell mail order though Sounds and at gigs. This album came in a plain sleeve with no title, having on it only a signature of one of the band members and no track listings. Influence Tatler has cited his early influences to be Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Rainbow. Tatler has stated that the first albums he bought were Led Zeppelin II and Deep Purple's Machine Head, and that his favourite album of all time is Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti, which contains his favourite song \\"Kashmir\\". He has said that he inspired to pick up the guitar by his older brother David and after listening to Ritchie Blackmore, Tatler was also inspired by the punk rock movement in 1977 which proved that anyone could form a band and start gigging. Nowadays, Tatler tries not to be influenced by more modern bands to keep his traditional style, although he imagines that \\"little bits creep into the writing process\\". \\"Am I Evil?\\", Diamond Head's best known and most influential song, was directly inspired by the Sabbath song \\"Symptom of the Universe\\". Tatler is also a big fan of AC/DC, Rush, Van Halen, UFO and Judas Priest. MCA years The success of the first album led to a record deal with MCA Records in 1982, and they released the Four Cuts EP. Their \\"major label\\" status afforded them a slot on the Reading Festival bill in 1982. Their set was recorded by the BBC, and later released in 1992 through Raw Fruit Records as the Friday Rock Show Sessions. Their first MCA LP was Borrowed Time, which reached No. 24 in the UK Albums Chart. In many interviews Tatler has stated that 1982 was his favourite year, and found the era to be extremely exciting, trying to guess who is going to be the first NWOBHM band to make it big. Their follow-up, Canterbury, was released in 1983. Tatler has expressed since that making this album was one of the most stressful periods of his life, and the entire process almost caused him to have a nervous breakdown. He also said that making the decision to fire his best friend Duncan Scott from the band was one of the hardest things he has had to do. In hindsight Tatler has said that its was a terrible shame that Diamond Head split in half during the recording of the Canterbury album (Duncan was fired and Colin quit the band) \\"We should have said the band is more important than the album, not the other way round.\\" The band split completely in 1985. Around the same time, Tatler also decided that it was time to retire his signature white Flying V and convert to a Gibson Les Paul. His white 1979 Gibson Flying V broke five times at the top of the neck and Tatler decided it was too fragile to take on the road. He said the Les Paul was a way more solid guitar capable of being dropped and not breaking. Tatler now owns three Gibson Les Paul Standards that are used for recording and gigs plus he uses a black 2016 Gibson Flying V for live work \\"I take the V if we are driving but if we are flying I will take a Les Paul\\". 1985-1994=Radio Moscow After Diamond Head split, Tatler went on to run a 24-track studio called RPK in Lye, recording and producing local bands between 1985 and 1990. He also formed the band Radio Moscow (not to be confused with the modern American blues-rock band of the same name) Radio Moscow recorded two albums, (World Service and Get a New Life) both of which featured Ritch Battersby on drums, who later went on to perform with The Wildhearts. Tatler co-wrote all the songs and played guitar on World Service but fell out with the studio owner (ex-Diamond Head manager Reg Fellows) and so was replaced in the band in 1990. Tatler played no part in the follow up album. First Diamond Head reunion Pete Winkelman suggested to Tatler that he reforms Diamond Head with Sean Harris in 1990. Tatler signed to Warner/Chappell publishing (who Sean was already signed to from the \\"Notorious\\" debacle) and the pair began writing new material. Their fourth album Death and Progress was originally intended to be released on the East/West label but after two years and a lot of complications the album was eventually released on Castle Communications in 1993. Unfortunately the reunion was short lived and the band split again in 1994 shortly after the release of the Evillive album recorded at the MK Bowl. Modern Day=Quill After the split, Tatler joined Thin Lizzy tribute act, Dizzy Lizzy, before joining up with the Celtic rock band, Quill in 1997. During his time with Quill, Tatler recorded three albums (Out of the Hat, Privileged and Back Intact). Tatler also played with tribute bands Jean Genie and Limehouse Lizzy. Diamond Head's acoustic years and Nick Tart era Andy Abberley and Brian Tatler 2008 Tatler played his last show with Quill in November 2000, and teamed up with Harris and Stourbridge guitarist/singer Floyd Brennan to perform and record an acoustic version of Diamond Head songs. Also during this time, Tatler collaborated with Dave Mustaine of Megadeth on an album together. This project was shelved and never released. In 2002 an offer to play the Metal Meltdown IV Festival in New Jersey prompted Tatler & Harris to put an electric band together recruiting Karl Wilcox (drums) and Eddie Moohan (bass). Diamond Head played their first gig in North America. Work began on a new album called Host however it was never released. Harris' reluctance to tour as Diamond Head and suggested a name change. Tatler was not interested in changing the name from Diamond Head to Host so a power struggle developed until Tatler eventually sacked Harris and bought in another singer. Enter Nick Tart from Cannock in the West Midlands who sang on Diamond Head's fifth studio album, All Will Be Revealed, which was released through Cargo Records in 2005. Tatler stated that his aim was just to try to release a solid rock album, with \\"punchy\\" riffs and no fillers. Diamond Head supported Megadeth on their tour at this time, as a favor from Mustaine. In 2007 Diamond Head released their final album with Nick Tart, What's in Your Head?. Tart emigrated to Brisbane in 2008. In 2009, Tatler released his autobiography, Am I Evil?. \\"It all started in a bedroom with a biscuit tin drum kit and a cheap fuzzy guitar, and went on to create some of the most exciting music ever written and inspire the biggest heavy metal band on the planet\\". The book contained forewords by Lars Ulrich and Mustaine. It was re-released in 2017 with it being updated to include new singer Rasmus Bom Andersen and the 2016 album Diamond Head. In 2011 Tatler co-wrote the song \\"Black Skies Mist\\" with rising Birmingham Rock band Voodoo Johnson.

He previously played in MLB for the New York Mets, Washington Nationals, and Chicago Cubs. While primarily a second baseman, he has also played first base, third base, and left field. Murphy was an MLB All-Star in 2014, 2016, and 2017. En route to leading the New York Mets to their fifth World Series appearance in franchise history, he won the National League Championship Series MVP Award in 2015, setting a record for consecutive postseason games with a home run with six. Murphy is the National League representative of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Early life Daniel Murphy was born in Jacksonville, Florida, to Tom and Sharon Murphy. Murphy has a younger brother, Jonathan, and a sister, Tricia. Murphy began playing baseball at the age of five years and played his high school ball at Englewood High School in Jacksonville. Jacksonville University was the only four-year school to offer Murphy a scholarship. College baseball Murphy attended Jacksonville University, where he played college baseball for the Dolphins under head coach Terry Alexander. In college, he was regarded as a strong hitter, but a below- average fielder. As a freshman, when asked to introduce himself and name what position he played (implying his defensive position), Murphy instead gave his preferred position in the batting order: \\"I'm Daniel Murphy from Jacksonville and I hit third.\\" He mostly played third base but was also slotted into right field to minimize the defensive liability. As a junior in 2006, Murphy posted a .398 batting average en route to being named the A-Sun Baseball Player of the Year. Professional career=New York Mets The New York Mets selected Murphy in the 13th round, with the 394th overall pick, of the 2006 MLB draft. The first two months of Murphy's professional career were spent rehabilitating a knee injury he suffered late in his college career. He spent the entire 2007 season with the High-A St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League. =2008‚Äì11= Murphy began the 2008 season with the Double-A Binghamton Mets. On August 2, a day after being promoted to the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs, the Mets left-handed reserve outfielder Marlon Anderson was placed on the disabled list, so Murphy was called up to the majors. In his first major league at bat, against three-time All-Star Roy Oswalt, Murphy hit a single. Later in the same game, he made a difficult catch against the left field wall, throwing out Hunter Pence at second base for a double play to end the inning. As of August 9, 2008, Murphy was only the fifth Mets rookie to record 10 hits in his first 20 at bats. Murphy hit his first home run in the bottom of the sixth inning against the Florida Marlins at Shea Stadium on August 9. He finished the season batting .313, with two home runs and 17 runs batted in (RBIs). New York Mets in 2009 Although he is a natural third baseman, Murphy began to play left field in 2008, and continued in 2009, due to the presence of David Wright on the Mets. Murphy had a hard time transitioning to left field. In May, Carlos Delgado underwent hip surgery and Murphy moved to first base. Murphy led the Mets in home runs, with 12. This tied 1977 as the season with the fewest home runs to lead a Mets team in franchise history. On March 30, 2010, Murphy hurt his knee in a spring training game against the St. Louis Cardinals in a rundown between third base and home plate. On June 2, while playing second base for the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, he suffered a \\"high-grade\\" MCL tear while trying to turn a double play. Although surgery was not needed, he was expected to miss 4‚Äì6 months. Murphy suffered a season-ending injury to his MCL on August 7, 2011 after a collision with the Atlanta Braves' Jos√© Constanza. At the time of his season-ending injury, Murphy had the 3rd highest batting average in the National League. However, Murphy did not have enough at-bats to qualify as a league leader at the conclusion of the 2011 season. =2012‚Äì2014= Murphy began the 2012 season as the Mets' starting second baseman after recovering from his MCL injury from 2011. On April 9, he hit a walk-off single against the Nationals to give the Mets a 4‚Äì3 victory, and their first 4‚Äì0 start since 2007. After going 352 at-bats since his last home run on July 16, 2011, Murphy hit two against the Cubs on June 27. Murphy was named as the Mets nominee for the 2012 MLBPAA Heart & Hustle Award which was ultimately won by Mike Trout of the Angels. Murphy had a strained muscle on his right side during spring training. He returned to training on February 20, said he didn't have a timetable for his return to regular workouts. For the period ending September 1, Murphy was named the National League Player of the Week after accumulating five doubles, seven runs and thirteen hits. Murphy had a strong 2013, establishing himself as one of the best offensive 2nd basemen in the league. Murphy played in 161 games and batted .286. Murphy finished 2nd in the National League with 188 hits. Murphy also contributed 13 home runs and 78 RBIs. Murphy led the National League in stolen base success rate, swiping 23/26 bases, an 88.4 percent success rate. Following the season, he was again nominated for the MLBPAA Heart & Hustle Award, this time losing out to Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia. Murphy was named to his first Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2014 as the backup to starter Chase Utley. His roster position was announced on July 6, at which time he had 105 hits (second in the National League) and a .295 batting average. =2015= Murphy on 2015 World Series Media Day In 2015, after an injury to David Wright, Murphy was moved to third base on June 4. He spent the regular season splitting his time between first base, second base, and third base. Murphy hit the 225th and 226th doubles of his career in a game against the Atlanta Braves on September 22, giving him the second-most doubles in Mets franchise history, ahead of Ed Kranepool and behind David Wright. In the deciding fifth game of the 2015 National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Murphy had three hits, including the game-winning home run in the sixth inning, to lead the Mets to a 3-2 win. He had also scored the Mets' second run of the game, after singling, going first-to-third on a walk, and scoring on a sacrifice foul-out. For the entire NLDS, Murphy had five RBI and seven hits in 21 at-bats, three of them being home runs and one of them being a double, giving him a 1.143 OPS. Over the course of the NLDS and 2015 National League Championship Series (NLCS), Murphy became the first person in major league history to hit a home run in six consecutive postseason games, beating a record set by Carlos Beltr√°n, and became the second person, after Lou Gehrig, to have a hit, a run, and an RBI in seven consecutive postseason games. He also broke a Mets franchise record for most home runs in the postseason, previously held by Mike Piazza. He hit .529 with four home runs, a double and six RBI and was named the 2015 NLCS MVP. During the eighth inning of game 4 of the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Murphy made a key fielding error which increased Kansas City's chances of winning the game by 32%. The Royals went on to win 5-3. Murphy tallied two errors and only three hits in his 20 at-bats as the Mets lost the five-game series. During the off-season, the Mets offered Murphy a one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer. On November 13, 2015, Murphy rejected the offer, thus becoming a free agent. This ensured the Mets a compensation draft pick if he signed with another team. Washington Nationals in 2016 spring training Washington Nationals On December 24, 2015, Murphy agreed to a three-year, $37.5 million contract with the Washington Nationals. The New York Mets gained a draft pick from the Nationals since Murphy turned down New York's one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer. The Mets got a compensation pick between the first and second rounds. =2016= On May 2, 2016, Murphy recorded his 1,000th career hit in a game against the Kansas City Royals. On June 5, 2016, Murphy was selected to his second all-star game. He was nearly voted a starter by fans, losing to the Cubs' Ben Zobrist by just 88 votes. In 142 games, Murphy finished the year with a .347 batting average, 25 home runs, and 104 RBI. He also led the NL in doubles (47), slugging percentage (.595), and on- base-plus-slugging (OPS) percentage (.985). He won his first Silver Slugger Award, being named the best offensive National League second baseman of 2016.Castillo, Jorge, \\"Daniel Murphy, Wilson Ramos win Silver Slugger Awards,\\" washingtonpost.com, November 10, 2016, 6:43 PM EST.

In 144 games, Murphy finished the year with a .322 batting average, 23 home runs, and 93 RBI, despite battling a knee injury for at least part of the season. His batting average was best among National League second basemen and second-best in the National League overall, and his .928 on-base-plus-slugging (OPS) percentage was the best by a National League second basemen and more than 130 points higher than the next-best OPS among them.

Personal life Daniel's younger brother, Jonathan, also played college baseball at Jacksonville University as an outfielder and was selected in the 19th round (580th overall) of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft by the Minnesota Twins. In August 2014, the Twins organization released Jonathan from the Cedar Rapids Kernels. In 2011, Murphy appeared with fellow Major Leaguers Shane Victorino and Clay Buchholz on a special Veterans Day episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. Murphy married his longtime girlfriend, Victoria \\"Tori\\" Ahern, on December 1, 2012, in Florida. The couple have three children; two sons and a daughter. When Daniel Murphy took a three-day leave of absence from the team to attend the birth of his child, something guaranteed by the MLB collective bargaining agreement, he received heavy criticism from New York City radio commentators Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton on their show for doing so. While they were roundly criticized for their comments‚Äîincluding a statement by Mets manager Terry Collins where he told them to \\"look in the mirror\\"‚ÄîMurphy himself said only that he was aware of the comments. On June 9, 2014, Murphy was invited to speak at the Working Families Summit at the White House. In March 2015, Major League Ambassador for Inclusion, Billy Bean, visited the Mets spring training clubhouse.

Its main building, designed by Ralph Adams Cram and built in 1899-1902, and was a gift to the city from Pawtucket's first mayor, Frederic Clark Sayles, in memory of his recently deceased wife. History The library was founded as the Pawtucket Library Association in 1852. This group purchased private libraries around the city, and in 1876 gifted its 4,700 volumes to the town for public use. The library's first librarian was Minerva Sanders, who worked there until her retirement in 1910. Sanders was nationally recognized for her innovative services such as allowing open access to book stacks and permitting children to use the library. By 1898, it became clear that the library needed a permanent home. A competition to design the library attracted twenty-four entries. The winning entry was submitted by Boston's Cram, Goodhue, & Ferguson. The building's cornerstone was laid on Nov. 18, 1899, and the building opened on Oct. 15, 1902. The library was the first in the nation to allow patrons to browse the shelves directly, instead of requiring a librarian to retrieve books for them. Architect Raymond Hood, a Pawtucket native, and sculptor Lee Lawrie, a team who much later became known for their work on Rockefeller Center, worked on the library building while in the employ of Boston architectural firm Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson. An expansion to the library in the 1960s has been called \\"awkward and insensitive.\\" The library's main building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975; the connected former Pawtucket Post Office building was listed in 1976. Efforts began in 1979 to renovate and join the two buildings, with work completing in 1982. The post office building was dedicated as the Gerald S. Burns building, and together with the Deborah Cook Sayles Public Library building, became what is known today as the Pawtucket Public Library. Deborah Cook Sayles Public Library building Pawtucket Public Library, 1901 The Classical Revival building features ionic columns, a pediment, egg-and- dart moldings, with high relief panels on its wings. The main fa√ßade is closely styled after the north porch of the Erectheion on the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Reliefs Reliefs above the six windows on either side of the pediment The six bas-reliefs above the library windows depict scenes from literature and mythology.

Burns building Under U.S. Treasury supervising architects William Martin Aiken, and James Knox Taylor, construction of the Pawtucket Post Office commenced in 1896, on Summer Street, and High Street, downtown Pawtucket. Built of red brick on a granite pedestal, and with a domed tower, the Beaux-Arts inspired building was completed in November, 1897. The tower entranceway, now closed off, is framed by granite Doric columns supporting an entablature, on top of which sit two stone eagles. The street-facing facades radiate away from this entrance, with five round- arch window bays separated by pilasters, with pedimented secondary entrances at the far end. Serving as the post office until 1941, the City of Pawtucket acquired the building to become the Municipal Welfare Building until the late 1970s when renovations began to join it with the Deborah Cook Sayles Public Library, later renamed and dedicated as the Gerald S. Burns building. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

He was the self-appointed leader of paramilitary units in Getashen and Martunashen villages in Shahumyan Region of Soviet Azerbaijan during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. He was killed during Operation Ring by the Soviet Azerbaijani OMON (special police). Biography Born in the village of Areg near the town of Talin, Armenia, he completed his elementary and intermediary education in the Technical School of Talin. After serving in the Soviet army, in 1987 he entered the Faculty of History of Yerevan State University. In his first year at the university, Tatul joined the Armenian-liberation movement. He was also a member of the \\"Miatsum\\" (Unification) organization, whose efforts were directed to unite Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast with Armenia. Operation Ring In September 1990, he traveled to Nagorno- Karabakh, where the situation continued to deteriorate. Joining the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Tatul has founded the \\"Dashnaktsakanner\\" unit of volunteers in Karabakh. He headed the self-defense of the sub-district Getashen-Martunashen from September 1990 until May 1991 against Azerbaijani armed forces units and police detachments (OMON). Krpeyan was killed on 30 April 1991 in Getashen during the Operation Ring. He received the highest title in Armenia, the National Hero of Armenia award in 1996. He was buried in Areg, which has been renamed after the hero ‚Äì Tatul. A tuffaceous monument has been erected in memory of Tatul. The sculptor of the monument is Tariel Hakobian. In the spring of 1991 the main battleground of the partisan war was the wooded hills to the north of Nagorno-Karabakh where fighters from Armenia infiltrated to Armenian inhabited villages. Tatul Krpeyan led his people to Getashen and Martunashen. On 10 April 1991 the decision was made by the authorities to start operations against these villages. The Moscow-based human rights group Memorial has reconstructed what happened. On 30 April 1991, 4th Army soldiers and then the Azerbaijani OMON entered Getashen near Shahumian, where Krpeyan was killed, and his people took several soldiers hostage. The OMON raided and looted houses and attacked many of the inhabitants. The dozen or so killed were in their eighties and nineties. Legacy Many works of art have been dedicated to Krpeyan. In 2004 Rafayel Sahakian has published a fictional documentary book named Artsvapasht Yerkir (Eagle-idolizing land), dedicated to him. The song \\"Leran Lanjin\\" (\\"Piedmont\\") was composed by Nersik Ispiryan. \\"Mayramut Ijav\\" (\\"At Sunset\\") was composed by Ashusgh Gevorg, as well as Ashot Babayan's sonata for cello and piano in 1993, were all reportedly dedicated to Tatul Krpeyan's memory. In 2015, on his 50th birthday a school and a park in Yerevan were named in his honor. Stamps depicting Krpeyan were issued.

The estate lies approximately south-east of the town centre, to the east of the A322 road and south of the A329 road. It is in Harmans Water ward, which following boundary changes now includes parts of Bullbrook, Martins Heron and The Parks. Facilities include a shopping centre, a library, several public houses and Harmans Water Primary School . St. Pauls Church has shared Church of England and United Reformed Church services and is situated adjacent to the shopping centre. There are a few office buildings in Broad Lane but otherwise the estate is largely residential. The Parks The Parks is a recent development and is on the site of the former RAF Staff College which closed in 1997. The first phase of the development, of 220 homes was developed by English Partnerships and completed in 2008. As of 2016 development continues with a further 530 homes and is due to be completed in 2017.
