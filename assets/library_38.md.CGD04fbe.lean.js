It is a Grade I listed building[1], rated \\"in the top 4% of listed buildings\\" by English Heritage and is afforded a three star (the highest) rating by the Theatres Trust, \\"a very fine theatre of the highest theatrical and architectural quality\\". It opened in 1867 as the Tyne Theatre and Opera House, designed by the Newcastle upon Tyne architecture practice of William Parnell. The backstage area was damaged by fire in 1985, with subsequent rebuilding restoring the Victorian stage machinery. The importance of the architectural and theatrical heritage of the building is also recognised by The Associated of Historic Theatres in Europe and OISTAT (the International Organisation of Scenographers, Theatre Technicians and Architects).  Brief history  It opened in 1867 as the Tyne Theatre and Opera House, designed by the Newcastle upon Tyne architecture practice of William Parnell.[2] In 1919 it became a cinema, the Stoll Picture House, the name which can still be seen on the building front and side. The cinema closed in March 1974 and the building was closed for 3 years, reopening as a theatre in July 1977.[3] It was damaged by a backstage fire in 1985, with subsequent rebuilding restoring the Victorian stage machinery.[1] The theatre has changed hands and management many times. From 2012 to 2014 it was called the Mill Volvo Tyne Theatre, operated by SMG Europe, and sponsored by Volvo.[5] It was sponsored by The Journal newspaper during the 2000s, until January 2012. Now the theatre is run by an independent Limited Company Tyne Theatre & Opera House Ltd, which is a subsidiary of the Tyne Theatre & Opera House Preservation Trust. The theatre is a charity and all funds raised by both the Preservation Trust and the Operational Company are used to preserve the building.  The Building  One of only about twenty-three Grade One listed theatres in Great Britain, the theatre is also one of only ten that date to the Victorian period. The north part of the building is located within the boundary of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. Stage and understage The stage represents perhaps the most complete working example of the English wood stage - possessing four bridges, eight cuts, one carpet cut, two corner traps, three warm thrappled wing shafts, two staircase traps, three object traps and one grave trap. Overhead there is a series of drum and shaft mechanisms to operate synchronised scene-changes, and a hemp fly floor stage left with drum and shaft for the act drop. An exceptionally complete surviving example of early stage machinery. Deep stage with five sets of tabs, machinery and control panel. Complete switchboard for earliest electric lighting. Very deep and high backstage, dressing and ancillary rooms with many period features. Facade Italianate front of three storeys, five bays (the outer bays narrower) in pale brick with stone dressings. Stone cornice with long brackets, tall parapet and pediment over; small semi-circular pediments, flanked by urns, at sides. Arcaded second floor Ground floor modernised, Lozenge or pointed first floor window. Painted advertisement on left return gable: THE/STOLL/TYNESIDE'S/TALKIE/THEATRE. Auditorium Extraordinary and beautiful circular panelled ceiling, tilting upwards from the proscenium towards the gallery. Excellent plasterwork. This auditorium, undoubtedly one of the finest of its date in Britain, remains structurally the same as when originally built. Interior Horse-shoe shaped auditorium with three tiers of balconies on cast iron columns with floral capitals and long cantilever brackets. Balconies S-curved with thick applied baroque decoration. One set of boxes at either side framed in Orders below and by two large female terms at top stage. Shell-shaped ceiling and very high proscenium arch.  Opening and early years  The Tyne Theatre & Opera House originally opened on Monday 23 September 1867 and was designed by William Parnell for Joseph Cowen (1829-1900), politician and industrialist, and son of Sir Joseph Cowen, a prominent citizen and Member of Parliament for Newcastle upon Tyne from 1865 to 1873. Money for the construction and no doubt materials for the theatre came from the family business, the Blaydon Brickworks, four miles west of Newcastle. The original design was to house a stock companyhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-41228954 (producing theatre company) managed by George Stanley who successfully staged locally produced drama, opera, musical spectacles and pantomimes from 1867 until 1881. By the 1880s improvements in railway communications made touring productions more available and local productions of drama and opera were unable to compete with star vehicles from London. The second lessee of the Tyne Theatre & Opera House was Richard William Younge who managed the theatre from 1881 to 1887. When Younge died in June 1887, Augustus Henry Glossop Harris, well known for being the manager and lessee of the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, took over the lease of the Tyne Theatre & Opera House. Harris had very successfully run the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, London since 1879 and has been referred to as the ‚ÄòFather of modern Pantomime‚Äô. Harris was knighted in 1891. It was under his and especially the productive joint lease with Frederick WP Wyndham and James Brown Howard, headquartered in Edinburgh, who had been running the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, that the majority of the late 19th century alterations to the theatre were carried out. The buildings that currently house the Bistro Bar and the shops to the West of the theatre were added at this time creating a Grand Salon for entrance to the stalls and circle seating. Following the partnership of Wyndham and Howard the newly formed Howard & Wyndham Ltd, created by Michael Simons of Glasgow in 1895 took over the lease. These partnerships with larger groups brought major stars and spectacularly staged productions to the theatre.  The Cinema Years  The changing market for theatre during the First World War and the growing popularity of the movies brought about the closure of the theatre in 1917. The theatre was leased by Sir Oswald Stoll and converted for cinema use by 1919 (following on from some experimentation in 1916 by Howard & Wyndham). There were already six cinemas in Newcastle by the time the Theatre was converted to a picture house. The Stoll Picture Theatre opened on 2 June 1919 with an opening presentation of ‚ÄòTarzan of the Apes‚Äô. The Stoll Picture Theatre was the first cinema in Newcastle to show ‚Äòtalkies‚Äô. The conversion, unlike that of many other theatres around the country was minimal. The theatre machinery was left in situ and the key changes at this time included the construction of a projector box at Upper Circle level, a cinema screen over the stage and alterations to the entrances of the building. The conversion was carried out by the office of Frank Matcham & Co., prominent theatre architects in London. The theatre thrived as a cinema through four decades but due to a rise in the popularity of television, the number of people going to the cinema declined during the 1960s and the Stoll cinema attempted to counter this by cornering a select market showing ‚ÄòX‚Äô rated films. This did not help maintain the cinema and it closed on 23 March 1974 after a bill of ‚ÄòDanish Bed and Board‚Äô.  The New Tyne Theatre  The Stoll cinema remained closed for three years, during which time a ‚ÄòSave the Stoll‚Äô campaign had been started by Mr Jack Dixon. A protection order was placed on the building in 1974 and was the first step for the Tyne Theatre Preservation Group. In 1976, the Stoll Theatre Corporation agreed to lease the theatre to the Tyne Theatre Trust for 28 years. It was during the closure of the theatre and exploration of the building that the original 1867 stage machinery was discovered in situ and intact, along with the stage sets from the last show performed ‚Äì all simply concealed behind the inserted cinema screen. The New Tyne Theatre and Opera House Company Limited was formed as an independent registered charity with the aim to restore and reopen the theatre for stage performances. In 1980, the Company made an offer to purchase the theatre and the surrounding property from the Stoll Corporation and the offer was accepted. The Trust first acquired the lease of the adjacent public house and then proceeded to purchase the entire block comprising 5 shops, 2 public houses, a restaurant, offices and six flats. The investment was seen as an endowment fund for the ongoing running of the theatre. One of the most memorable performances for the Tyne Theatre & Opera House following its restoration in the 1970s was in the return of opera to the theatre with Tosca on the evening of 6 May 1983, with Pl√°cido Domingo as the lead. The Northern Sinfonia of England filled the orchestra pit and was conducted by Robin Stapleton. At this time, the Bistro Bar was renamed ‚ÄòTosca‚Äôs‚Äô.  Grade 1 Listing, the fire and after  In August 1985, the Tyne Theatre & Opera House was upgraded from a Grade II* listing to Grade I. On 25 December 1985 there was a fire in the backstage area of the theatre, which destroyed the flytower. Following the fire, on 14 January 1986, a strong wind caused the remaining standing wall of the flytower to fall through the stage, damaging the Victorian wooden stage machinery and stage. Fortunately, work had been suspended on site that day due to the wind. Prior to this, the stage machinery was largely intact. Miraculously, the task of rebuilding began almost immediately under the direction of Mr Jack Dixon, who was responsible for organising the original restoration programme in 1977. With the insurance money, the Company set about replacing the damaged structure and refurbishing the auditorium to a higher standard than had previously been possible. Works included a new roof, further dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms. By November 1986, less than a year after the fire, the theatre was reopened and its stage machinery operational again, reusing as much as could be salvaged from the fire. This was only 11 months after the fire and work had been competed for a total cost of ¬£1.5million. In 1987, Northern Arts helped broker a deal where the Tyne and Wear Theatre Company, then based at the Playhouse Theatre, was moved to the Tyne Theatre & Opera House and towards the end of this year, they had signed short term lease on the building. Unfortunately, this arrangement was short-lived and by 1989, the New Tyne Theatre and Opera House Company Limited was in a difficult position financially. In the search for a financial solution to keep the theatre running, the Company looked to its property interests and also went into partnership with the local College of Technology (now Newcastle College) to establish a centre for performing arts within Waterloo House to the south of the theatre. The City Council and other interested parties intended to create a national centre of excellence in the performing arts ‚Äì based around the theatre. Unfortunately accumulating debts forced the New Tyne Theatre and Opera House Company into administration in 1995. The Tyne Theatre & Opera House was purchased by Mr Karl Watkin for ¬£650,000 on 7 December 1995. He planned to use the theatre as a national base for the D‚ÄôOyly Carte Opera Company (it was later found to be unobtainable) and to create a centre of excellence for lyric theatre. During the time of his ownership, Watkin maintained the theatre building and honoured the previous owner's agreement with the College to improve the performing arts facilities. Between 1996 and 1998, Watkin attempted to run the theatre as a commercial venue in competition with the Theatre Royal, which put a financial strain on the theatre. By the late 1990s Watkin sought to recover some of his financial losses from the theatre by subdividing and selling off portions of the associated properties. In 2004, the Council brokered a partnership with Adderstone Properties, SMG Europe and the Tyne Theatre and Opera House Preservation Trust for the operation and development of the theatre and the development of new flats in the space vacated by the College. As part of the arrangements, the Council secured a five-year option for the purchase of the theatre. The history of the theatre throughout the 20th century has been one of versatility and enterprise to keep the theatre in use ‚Äì to help it survive, and this character and quality of the theatre continues today, through variety of performance and flexible use of the building. In March 2008, Newcastle City Council was able to purchase the theatre from Adderstone Properties for ¬£600,000 and later that year transfer the freehold ownership to the Tyne Theatre and Opera House Preservation Trust. At the time of purchase, SMG Europe, managers of the Newcastle Arena and part of a multi-national theatre and facilities management company still had over 11 years to run on their 15-year lease of the Tyne Theatre & Opera House. SMG Europe stepped away from the theatre in December 2014 after Newcastle Panto Company's Christmas production.  Tyne Theatre & Opera House today  The building is now managed by Tyne Theatre & Opera House Ltd., a new subsidiary created by Tyne Theatre & Opera House Preservation Trust. Back in January 2015 the theatre was given a new lease of life when a new operating company, Tyne Theatre & Opera House Ltd was set up to operate and manage the business. Together with the operating company, the Trustees of the Tyne Theatre & Opera House Preservation Trust are committed to restoring the theatre to its former glory and raising the necessary funds to ensure that its heritage is sustained for future generations. The objectives for which the Tyne Theatre & Opera House Preservation Trust is established are; (a) To acquire, restore and preserve for the benefit of the public at large the Grade One Listed Building known as The Tyne Theatre and Opera House; (b) The advancement of public education in all aspects of the dramatic arts by the presentation and production of plays and other expressions of drama including the commissioning of new works and the mounting of public performances and the mounting of classes, exhibitions and demonstrations of dramatic arts and theatre technology; (c) The advancement of public education in theatre technology by the preservation, conservation and exhibition of machinery and technology of the performing arts and the interpretation of such artifacts and their historical context; (d) The advancement of public education in all aspects of the arts including music and music theatre, drama, decorative and visual arts, dance, ballet, circus, music hall and comedy and variety performance. The Tyne Theatre and Opera House Preservation Trust has plans to undertake a major refurbishing of the Tyne Theatre over the next few years with the auditorium and stage machinery being restored back to their Victorian roots as well as the creation of an education and heritage centre.  Famous guests and performers  There have been many, many performers at the Tyne Theatre & Opera House since it was built in 1867. Apart from actors and actresses, there were various types of entertainers and speakers, as the theatre was also used for a time to hold Sunday lecture circuits. A summary list (this list is not exhaustive) of some of the main performers, entertainers and speakers over the years includes: * Oscar Wilde, in 1885 spoke on Fashionhttp://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north- east-news/final-act-secures-future-journal-4487424 * Former Prime Minister William Gladstone spoke in 1891 (at 82 years of age) at the end of his political career ‚Äì * Sarah Bernhardt performed at the Tyne Theatre three times from 1895 * Host to the first performance in Newcastle of La Boh√®me in 1897 by the Carl Rosa Opera Company and location for the first performance on any opera stage of The Jewels of the Madonna * Richard Todd, 1978, star of The Dambusters and Robin Hood * Pl√°cido Domingo performed in Tosca, May 1983 * Dame Joan Sutherland performed in 1989 * Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel performed in August 2018, in the set-list was the rarely played 2006 single, 'The Last Goodbye'.

History Morrison in England is traditionally believed to be a patronymic of Maurice/Morris,See George F Black (1946), p 612. introduced into England following the Norman invasion in 1066. In Scotland there is strong evidence that other surnames of Anglo Norman origin such as Moir, Muir and More, were equally influential as potential multiple origin points for the derivative of the modern spelling of Morrison. This is supported by evidence including the association of Moor or Saracen head(s) on some Moor, Moore, More, Mores, Morrison, Mure and Muir family crests.James Fairbairn (1905), pp 396-403.Alexander Moir (1913). While the Highland Clan Morrison derives from MacGhilleMhoire, or servants of Mary, the lowland Clan Morrison Society of Scotland, registered their arms featuring three Moor heads in 1919, demonstrating the symbolic similarity between all these families. Historical evidence suggests many early surnames in Scotland were nuanced and altered by such simple devices as phonetic interpretations by religious scribes. For example, Scottish records identify a marriage in 1584 between George Morese and Babara Forguson in Aberdeen.Scotlands People, Church Registers - Old Parish Registers Banns and Marriages, FR3914, 120 202, Aberdeen. Later in other Aberdeen records their names become George Moreson and Barbara Ferguson,Lord Provosts of Aberdeen (Munro, 1897, pp 165-167) then George Morrison and Barbara Ferguson.The Records of Aboyne (Huntly, 1894, p 276) Similar Morrison name evolutions are recorded in Edinburgh at this time. Those from the Clan Morrison may originally have been anglicised to Morison, with Morrison becoming more widely used later on. Another form of name changing came through rebranding of surnames. This occurred in Scotland for both convenience or necessity to disguise a Scottish Highland name, for example, McCoinnich describes the adoption of the name Morrison on the Isle of Lewis (Eilean Le√≤dhais) around 1640 by families formerly known as \\"McBrief\\" or \\"mac a‚Äô Bhritheimh‚Äù.For example, see Aonghas McCoinnich (2015) who describes the adoption of the name Morrison on the Isle of Lewis around 1640 by families formerly known as \\"McBrief\\" or \\"mac a‚Äô Bhritheimh\\", pp 64-65. Alexander Morison (Heraldry of the Clan MacGhille-mhuire) makes the statement that the name is from ancestors who were vassals or adherents of the jarls of More or Moeri in Norway.Black (1946) makes the observation that \\"Equally baseless is the modern idea that \\"Morison\\" interpreted as \\"Mary‚Äôs son,\\" represents Gaelic Mac Gille Mhuire\\". Alexander Morison (Heraldry of the Clan MacGhille-mhuire) makes the wild statement that the name is from ancestors who were vassals or adherents of the jarls of More or Moeri in Norway! (Black, 1946, p 639). Perhaps the earliest recording of the recognisable surname Morrison is found in the English Yorkshire Poll Tax records in 1379 for \\"Ricardus Morisson‚Äù.see Nelson, P and Hinson, C. (2001) English Yorkshire Poll Tax records in 1379 for \\"Ricardus Morisson\\". Some fifty years later in Scotland there is a Morrison recorded as \\"Arthuro Morison domino de Darleith\\" being a witness to the \\"Resignation by John MacRoger of Gleane MacKerne, in favour of John of Culquoune of Luss, of Gleane Mackecherne, etc. 7th February 1429\\".See William Fraser (1869), \\"Arthuro Morison domino de Darleith\\" being a witness to the \\"Resignation by John MacRoger of Gleane MacKerne, in favour of John of Culquoune of Luss, of Gleane Mackecherne, etc. 7th February 1429\\", p 287. The spelling Morrison became more popular over Morisson and Morison later on. Following the gradual introduction of surnames in England, Scotland and Ireland many names such as Mirryson, Mirrison, Morisson, Morisone, Morrieson, Morriceson, Morason, Moorison, Mooresone, Morisoun, Moresoun, Murison, Muirison, Murieson, Murrison, Muresoun, Muirsoun and no doubt many other phonetic synonyms or Anglicised adaptations evolved and were standardised to become Morrison, Morison or Murison. Such standardisation in Scotland came after 1854 when Lord Elcho (Francis Richard Chateris, 10th Earl of Weymss) finally succeeded in framing An Act to Provide for the Better Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages in Scotland, 31 May 1854.Anne Cameron (2007) describes the history of this Act in detail, pp 377-395. Overall there is a common inconsistency in the spelling of Morrison or Morison in many records throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland. There is no particular rule or convention that specifies which spelling should be used. Morrison and Morison families today are widely distributed across England, Scotland and Ireland and in many cases with no common genetic or family ancestry. Morison is typically the older spelling of ancestors of the Clan Morrison from Sutherland and the Eilean Le√≤dhais, with Morrison being the more commonly used now. People with the surname *A. B.

Eighteen days before the season started, the September 11 terrorist attacks took place in New York. The season premiere (hosted by Reese Witherspoon) went on as scheduled, with a special cold open featuring Rudy Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City at the time, along with firefighters from the FDNY and police officers from the NYPD, declaring that despite the terrorist attack, New York City will run as normal and Saturday Night Live will go on as planned (with Lorne Michaels asking Giuliani \\"Can we be funny?\\" and Giuliani replying \\"Why start now?\\"). Three weeks into the season the show faced another scare when anthrax was found in the GE Building (from where the show is broadcast). The scare caused most of the cast and crew, as well as that week's guest host Drew Barrymore, to evacuate the building. Cast Before the start of the season, Jerry Minor and Chris Parnell were both let go from the show. However, Parnell was hired back to the show mid-season in the episode hosted by Jonny Moseley, becoming the second cast member to be hired back to the show after being fired, the first person being Jim Belushi in 1983. Four new cast members were hired to the show: stand-up comic Dean Edwards, Chicago improv comedian Seth Meyers, Amy Poehler of the Upright Citizens Brigade comedy troupe, and stand-up comic/impressionist Jeff Richards who was previously a cast member on the rival sketch show Mad TV. Rachel Dratch, Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph were all upgraded to repertory status at the beginning of the season, and Poehler was promoted to repertory status mid- season.

Critics cite the composition as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was usually preceded by \\"The Fish Cheer\\", a cheer spelling out \\"F-I-S-H\\". An altered version of the cheer that was performed in live performances, known as \\"The Fuck Cheer\\", resulted in a television ban for Country Joe and the Fish in 1968, for the vulgarity, but was applauded by concert-goers. \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\" saw a more commercial release on the group's second album, I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die, which was distributed in November 1967. The song was a favorite among the hippie culture, and was featured in McDonald's set list at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. Decades later, McDonald had a lawsuit filed against him for allegedly infringing on the copyright of Kid Ory's tune, \\"Muskrat Ramble\\". McDonald denied these allegations and the suit was later dismissed.  History =Composition and Rag Baby Although the song achieved national notoriety when it was included on Country Joe and the Fish's second album, I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die, it was first composed and distributed two years prior. In 1965, Country Joe McDonald founded and edited for a local counterculture magazine in Berkeley, California, which he called Rag Baby ‚Äì a Bay Area adaptation of the folk magazine Broadside. McDonald published four editions of the magazine, and sought to incorporate musical influences to support Rag Baby left-wing message. To accommodate the issue, McDonald was inspired to distribute a \\"talking issue\\" of the magazine, an extended play called Rag Baby Talking Issue No. 1. In June 1965, an early incarnation of Country Joe and the Fish recorded an acoustic version of \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\", the later debut album track, \\"Superbird\\", and two other songs by local folk musician, Peter Krug at Arhoolie Records Studios, under the guidance of record producer Chris Strachwitz. According to McDonald, the rag was written in under 30 minutes with a conscious purpose of reflecting on the escalation of the Vietnam War, while he composed another song, \\"Who Am I\\", which was also relating to the US's increasing armed involvement. About 100 copies of the EP were pressed on McDonald's independent label and, were sold at Sproul Plaza in UC Berkeley, during a Teach-in, and in underground stores that stocked Rag Baby. The song's lyrics implicitly blame American politicians, high-level military officers, and industry corporations on starting the Vietnam War. McDonald composed \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\" in the summer of 1965, just as the U.S.'s military involvement was increasing, and was intensively opposed by the young generation. It expresses discontent towards the process of conscription, through the use of dark humor, and culminating in a reflection of casualties of the war, as hinted in the satirical invitation to \\"be the first one on your block, to have your boy come home in a box\\". In addition, the song features a signature chorus: The album version concludes with the uttering of several light machine guns firing and a final explosion, evoking the dropping of another atomic bomb. Album version and \\"The Fuck Cheer\\" After a brief stint performing as a duo in Berkeley, McDonald and Barry Melton recruited more members and eventually signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966. Inspired by the live performances of Bob Dylan and The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the group became fully intertwined in electric rock, and recorded a new electrified version of \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\" in Sierra Sound Laboratories, in February 1967. Initially, the song was going to be featured on Country Joe and the Fish's debut album, Electric Music for the Mind and Body, but record producer Sam Charters insisted that the track remain off the record. When the controversial composition \\"Superbird\\" was not banned from airplay, \\"I-Feel- Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\" was placed as the opening to their second album, I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die. The song was a popular attraction in the band's live performance. The song began with a \\"Fish Cheer\\", in which the band spells out the word \\"F-I-S-H\\" in the manner of cheerleaders at American football games (\\"Give me an F\\", etc.). In the summer of 1968, the first instance of the slightly altered version known as \\"The Fuck Cheer\\" appeared in New York City at the Shaefer Summer Music Festival, among a crowd of nearly 10,000. Drummer Gary \\"Chicken\\" Hirsh suggested that the opening chorus spell out \\"fuck\\", which was positively received by younger listeners, and led to unexpected radio exposure of the album version on both alternative radio stations and AM radio. Although Hirsh has never explained why he made the change, writer James E. Perone has speculated in his book Songs of the Vietnam Conflict that it was a \\"rebellious counterculture political act demonstrating free speech rights in the mid-1960s\\". However, executives from The Ed Sullivan Show were present at the concert, and barred Country Joe and the Fish from their scheduled appearance and any future performances on the show. Woodstock performance On August 16, 1969, the second day of the Woodstock Festival, McDonald made an unexpected solo performance of \\"The Fuck Cheer\\" at the conclusion of his set list, after Quill. McDonald was augmented with a Yamaha FG 150 guitar that he found and holstered with a rope. According to McDonald, \\"I went on with my guitar and it was like 'Here is this guy who's going to sing' but no one paid any attention. I played 'Janis' and 'Tennessee Stud' and then I walked off the stage. I asked my tour manager if he thought it would be OK if I went back on and did the cheer and he said yeah. So I went \\"Give me an F!\\", and they all yelled \\"F!\\" The audience receptively responded by cheering the \\"F-U-C-K\\" chant along with McDonald. The performance was featured on the Woodstock film, which included sing-a-long lyrical subtitles of \\"The Fuck Cheer\\". Country Joe and the Fish also performed on the third day of the festival, and also concluded their set with the cheer and \\"Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\". Copyright lawsuit In 2001, the heirs of New Orleans jazz trombonist Kid Ory launched a lawsuit against Country Joe McDonald, claiming that the music of \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\\" constituted plagiarism of \\"Muskrat Ramble\\", a number by Ory, recorded by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five in 1926. In 2005, a court dismissed the suit, holding that the Ory estate had waited too long to make the claim. If the action had been successful Country Joe McDonald would have been required to pay $150,000 for each live performance of the song in the three years since the lawsuit was filed. McDonald would have also been barred from ever performing the song again without the possibility of further damages.  Covers and features  Pete Seeger covered the song in 1970. There were initially plans to release his version as a single, and indeed some copies were sent out to DJs, but according to Seeger, distributors refused to handle it, and it was never officially released. It eventually found its way onto the Internet. It was also included as a bonus track on a reissue of his 1969 album Young vs. Old.the omni recording corporation McDonald performed part of the song while playing a folksinging hippie named \\"Joaquin\\" in the Tales of the City TV miniseries. McDonald has said that American prisoner of war Phillip N. Butler told him that the song was regularly broadcast into H·ªèa L√≤ Prison (the \\"Hanoi Hilton\\"), in North Vietnam, to the POWs by their captors, and Butler told him that the song actually boosted their morale as they hummed along. The Passion Killers, comprising several members of the band Chumbawamba, covered the song with modified lyrics on their 1991 single, \\"Whoopee! We're All Gonna Die!\\", as a protest against the first Gulf War.Chumbawamba Discography Eugene Chadbourne released a rewritten version entitled \\"Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die (Iraq)\\" on his 1991 7\\" single Oil of Hate. Japanese band Omoide Hatoba included a 40-second-long cover on their 1992 album Black Hawaii, with the title reading \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fix-in-to-Die Rag.\\" Sung by Public Bath Records' David Hopkins, it consists of the intro, first verse, chorus, and the chorus starting to repeat when Seiichi Yamamoto cuts it off by shouting \\"Next!\\" Swedish rock singer Svante Karlsson covered it in 2003 on his album Autograph. This version features a solo performed by legendary guitarist Albert Lee. The song has been featured in the films Woodstock (1970), More American Graffiti (1979), Purple Haze (1982), and Hamburger Hill (1987), and the HBO miniseries Generation Kill (2008). It was also featured in the TV show The Wonder Years, in the season 2 episode, titled \\"Walk Out\\" (1989). It was referenced on the 2008 edition of the AP United States History exam.

The influence of the Council of Forty-four waned in the face of internal conflict among the Cheyenne about Cheyenne policy toward encroaching white settlers on the Great Plains, and was dealt a severe blow by the Sand Creek Massacre. The Council of Forty-four was the council of chiefs, comprising four chiefs from each of the ten Cheyenne bands plus four principalHoig 1980, p. 11. or \\"Old Man\\" chiefs who had previously served on the council with distinction. Early in Cheyenne history, three related tribes known as the Heviqs-nipahis, the Sutaio and the Masikota, unified themselves to form the Ts√©-ts√™h√©st√¢hese or the \\"Like Hearted People\\" who are known today as the \\"Cheyenne.\\" The unified tribe then divided themselves into ten bands: * Heviqs-nipahis * H√©vhaitanio (He√©v√¢hetaneo'o) * Masikota * Om√≠sis (√îhm√©s√™heseo'o) * Sut√°io (S√≥'taeo'o) * Wot√°pio * Oivim√°na (O√©vemana) * His√≠ometanio (Hes√©'ome√©taneo'o) * Oqt√≥guna * H√≥nowa (H√°ov√¥hn√≥va) Council chiefs were generally older men who commanded wide respect; they were responsible for day-to-day matters affecting the tribeGreene 2004, p. 9. as well as the maintenance of peace both within and without the tribe by force of their moral authority.Hoig 1980, p. 8. While chiefs of individual bands held primary responsibility for decisions affecting their own bands, matters which involved the entire tribe such as treaties and alliances required discussions by the entire Council of Forty-four.Hoig 1980, p. 12. Chiefs were not chosen by vote, but rather by the Council of Forty-four, whose members named their own successors, with chiefs generally chosen for periods of ten years at councils held every four years. Many chiefs were chosen from among the ranks of the military societies, but were required to give up their society memberships upon selection. Military societies While chiefs were responsible for overall governance of individual bands and the tribe as a whole, the headmen of military societies were in charge of maintaining discipline within the tribe, overseeing tribal hunts and ceremonies, and providing military leadership. Council chiefs selected which of the six military societies would assume these duties; after a period of time on-duty, the chiefs would select a different society to take up the duties.Hyde 1968, p. 336. Deterioration of traditional tribal government Beginning in the 1830s, the Dog Soldiers had evolved from the Cheyenne military society of the same name into a separate, composite band of Cheyenne and Lakota warriors that took as its territory the headwaters country of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers in southern Nebraska, northern Kansas, and the northeast of Colorado Territory. By the 1860s, as conflict between Indians and encroaching whites intensified, the influence wielded by the militaristic Dog Soldiers, together with that of the military societies within other Cheyenne bands, had become a significant counter to the influence of the traditional Council of Forty-four chiefs, who were more likely to favor peace with the whites.Greene 2004, p. 26. The Sand Creek Massacre of November 29, 1864, besides causing a heavy loss of life and material possessions by the Cheyenne and Arapaho bands present at Sand Creek, also devastated the Cheyenne's traditional government, due to the deaths at Sand Creek of eight of 44 members of the Council of Forty-four, including White Antelope, One Eye, Yellow Wolf, Big Man, Bear Man, War Bonnet, Spotted Crow, and Bear Robe, as well as headmen of some of the Cheyenne's military societies.Greene 2004, p. 23. Among the chiefs killed were most of those who had advocated peace with white settlers and the U.S. government.Greene 2004, p. 24. The effect of this on Cheyenne society was to exacerbate the social and political rift between the traditional council chiefs and their followers on the one hand and the Dog Soldiers on the other.Greene 2004, p. 26. To the Dog Soldiers, the Sand Creek Massacre illustrated the folly of the peace chiefs' policy of accommodating the whites through the signing of treaties such as the first Treaty of Fort Laramie and the Treaty of Fort WiseGreene 2004, p. 27. and vindicated the Dog Soldiers' own militant posture towards the whites. The traditional Cheyenne clan system, upon which the system of choosing chiefs for the Council of Forty-four depended, was seriously undermined by the events at Sand Creek.Hyde 1968, p. 159. The moral authority of traditional Council chiefs to moderate the behavior of the tribe's young men and to treat with whites was severely hampered by these events as well as the ascendancy of the Dog Soldiers' militant policies. Today The Cheyenne Tribe maintains the Council of Forty-Four today, and some of current Peace Chiefs that are active in the Native American community include Gordon Yellowman, Sr.; Harvey Pratt; W. Richard West, Jr.;Belcher, Steve. \\"'Cheyenne Justice' exhibit on display.\\" Clinton Daily News. 18 May 2005. and Lawrence Hart.

Design and development The initial variant of the BR.2 developed , with nine cylinders measuring for a total displacement of 1,522 cubic inches (24.9 L).

This was the last type of rotary engine to be adopted by the RAF ‚Äì later air-cooled aircraft engines such as the Cosmos Jupiter and Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar being almost entirely of the fixed radial type. With the BR.2, the rotary engine had reached a point beyond which this type of engine could not be further developed, due to its inherent limitations.Gunston 1989, p.22. Applications The type selected as the standard single-seat fighter of the post-war RAF, the Sopwith Snipe, had been designed around the BR.2, as had its ground attack version, the Sopwith TF.2 Salamander. A number of other experimental and minor production types were either designed for, or otherwise fitted with this power plant during the late \\"war\\" years and into the early 1920s.

It reduces triglyceride levels and increases HDL cholesterol. It may have less marked adverse effects than niacin, although it is unclear whether the recommended dose is as effective as standard doses of niacin. Contraindications Contraindications are peptic ulcers, acute bleeding, recent heart attack, acute decompensated heart failure, and severe chronic kidney disease. Adverse effects As with niacin and related drugs, the most common adverse effects are flushing (associated with prostaglandin D2) and gastrointestinal disturbances such as indigestion, which occur in at least 10% of patients. Flushing can be reduced by taking aspirin 20 to 30 minutes before taking acipimox. Palpitations have also been described. High doses can cause headache, and precipitate gout. In contrast to niacin, no impairment of glucose tolerance and no disorders of liver function have been found in studies, even under high doses of acipimox.  Interactions  No interactions with other drugs are known. Theoretically, combination with statins and fibrates could increase the incidence of myalgia. Alcohol can increase the risk of flushing. Pharmacology=Mechanism of action Like niacin, acipimox acts on the niacin receptor 1, inhibiting the enzyme triglyceride lipase. This reduces the concentration of fatty acids in the blood plasma and their inflow into the liver. Consequently, VLDL cholesterol production in the liver is reduced, which leads indirectly to a reduction in LDL and increase in HDL cholesterol. Pharmacokinetics Acipimox is completely absorbed from the gut. It is not bound to blood plasma proteins and not metabolized. Elimination occurs in two phases, the first having a half- life of two hours, the second of 12 to 14 hours. The substance is eliminated via the kidney.

Functionality and conservation of the W-box element across plant species has been shown by gel shift experiments, random binding site selection, yeast one- hybrid screens and co-transfection assays performed with many different WRKY proteins. In silico-based studies together with functional studies of plant promoters have identified clusters of W-boxes in stress-inducible promoters. The binding of WRKY proteins to W-boxes is a feature of both biotic and abiotic stress responses, together with other plant processes such as germination. It has also been shown that multiple W-boxes have a synergistic effect on transcription. Almost all WRKY transcription factors bind preferentially to W-boxes, and since their discovery, this has raised the question as to how they show specificity for the promoters of their target genes. Ciolkowski et al. (2008) showed that although the W-box core is required, adjacent sequences also play a role in determining binding-site preference. Recent evidence suggests that the TGAC core is more degenerate, composed of a guanine adenine cytosine (GAC) core, and the upstream thymine and downstream pyrimidine flanking sequences help dictate recognition by specific WRKY factors. Basic residues of the WRKY protein domain also are believed to recognize the phosphate backbone of the cis-element. Recently, Yamasaki et al. have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal WRKY domain of Arabidopsis WRKY4 in complex with the W-box DNA by NMR. They found that a four-stranded Œ≤-sheet enters the major groove of DNA in a structure they called the Œ≤-wedge, where the sheet is nearly perpendicular to the DNA helical ais.

Digging began in 1837, and when it was opened on August 23, 1857 it was only deep. It was deepened in 1920. The canal began with the dock at St. Peter's Basin (Bassin Saint-Pierre), in the downtown area of Caen. The canal is made up of a group of quays and docks.

It may improve glycemic control and decrease insulin resistance in people with poorly controlled type-2 diabetes. It was on the market between 1976 and 2009, and is thought to have caused between 500 and 2,000 deaths. It was patented and manufactured by the French pharmaceutical company Servier. However, Servier is suspected of having marketed benfluorex at odds with the drug's medical properties. Drug withdrawn On 18 December 2009, the European Medicines Agency recommended the withdrawal of all medicines containing benfluorex in the European Union, because their risks, particularly the risk of heart valve disease (fenfluramine-like cardiovascular side effects), are greater than their benefits. Thus Frachon et al. showed a higher rate of unexplained valvular heart disease in people taking benfluorex. Weill et al. looked at over 1 million people with diabetes demonstrating a higher hospitalization rate in benfluorex takers for valvular heart disease. In France, the medication had been marketed as by Servier as an adjuvant antidiabetic under the name Mediator. The drug was on the market between 1976 and 2009, and is thought to have caused between 500 and 2,000 deaths. The drug was also used in Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus. Fenfluramine, a related drug, had been withdrawn from the market in 1997 after reports of heart valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, and development of cardiac fibrosis. This side effect is mediated by the metabolite norfenfluramine on 5HT2B receptors of heart valves, leading to a characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve. Both fenfluramine and benfluorex form norfenfluramine as a metabolite. This side effect led to the withdrawal of fenfluramine as an anorectic drug worldwide, and later to the withdrawal of benfluorex in Europe.

Terlep also won two Grey Cup championships in the Canadian Football League (CFL), once as an assistant with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and once as the general manager of the Ottawa Rough Riders. Terlep grew up in Indiana and was a star on his high school's football team. He went on to play as a backup quarterback at Notre Dame in 1943 under head coach Frank Leahy, but left the following year to serve in the U.S. military during World War II. He played briefly for a team at a military base in Illinois coached by Paul Brown. After the war, Terlep joined the Buffalo Bisons of the newly formed AAFC, playing quarterback there for two years. He then joined the Browns in 1948, when Cleveland won all of its games and a third straight AAFC championship. Terlep ended his playing career in 1949 to pursue coaching. He spent several years as a college backfield coach, first at the University of South Carolina, then at Vanderbilt, Marquette, Penn and Indiana. In 1957, he landed a job with the Tiger-Cats, who won the Grey Cup that year. His success there led to his hiring as head coach of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, but he was fired after losing the first 11 games of the 1959 season. He then became general manager of the Ottawa Rough Riders, and was responsible for bringing future hall of fame quarterback Ron Lancaster into the league. Terlep left football in 1962 and returned to his hometown, where he worked in the mobile homes business. He retired in 1985 to Florida, where he died in 2010. He was inducted into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1985. Early life and college Terlep grew up in Elkhart, Indiana, and was a standout halfback at the local Elkhart High School starting in 1937. He was named an all-state back by sportswriters in 1941, his senior year. Terlep was also named an All-Northern Indiana Athletic Conference player as the Elkhart Blue Blazers won a conference championship that year. After high school, Terlep enrolled on a football scholarship at Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, a Catholic university near his hometown. He played at quarterback for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in 1943, when the team finished with a 9‚Äì1 win-loss record and won a national championship under coach Frank Leahy. Terlep served as a center and as a backup to quarterback Angelo Bertelli, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1943. Terlep left Notre Dame toward the end of the 1944 season to join a V-12 Navy College Training Program put in place during World War II. He was transferred to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Illinois and played quarterback for the base's football team under Paul Brown, the former head coach at Ohio State. The Great Lakes Bluejackets finished the 1945 season with a 6‚Äì4‚Äì1 win-loss-tie record that included a victory over Notre Dame. Terlep ran for a touchdown and passed for another against his alma mater. Professional career With the war over, Terlep was discharged in 1946 and signed with the Buffalo Bisons, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He began the season as the starting quarterback but was replaced by former Notre Dame teammate George Ratterman as the Bisons finished their first season with a 3‚Äì10‚Äì1 record. The team followed up with an 8‚Äì4‚Äì2 record in 1947, when it was renamed the Bills. During the 1948 season, Terlep was traded to the Cleveland Browns, a rival AAFC team coached by Paul Brown. The Browns won all of their games and a third straight AAFC championship that year. Coaching career Terlep left the Browns in 1949 and finished his degree at Notre Dame, graduating cum laude in business administration. He then began a coaching career as an assistant at the University of South Carolina after Leahy, his former Notre Dame coach, recommended him. He worked at South Carolina for two seasons under head coach Rex Enright, a fellow Notre Dame graduate. He then moved to a job as an assistant at Vanderbilt University, where he remained through 1952. At Vanderbilt, he worked under head coach Bill Edwards. One of his colleagues there was defensive assistant Steve Belichick, the father of NFL coach Bill Belichick and a close friend of Terlep's until Belichick's death in 2005. Terlep's next stop was as backfield coach at Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1953 under head coach Lisle Blackbourn. Marquette finished with a 6‚Äì3‚Äì1 record that year, but Blackbourn resigned after the season to become the head coach of the NFL's Green Bay Packers. Terlep was a leading candidate to replace him, but was passed over in favor of Frosty Ferzacca, a Wisconsin high school coach. He left Marquette shortly thereafter to be backfield coach at the University of Pennsylvania under Steve Sebo. After two seasons during which the Penn Quakers failed to win a game, he left and took a job as backfield coach at Indiana University in 1956. He spent one season there. Terlep moved to Canada in 1957 to become backfield coach for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The team finished that season with a 10‚Äì4 record and beat the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in November to win the Grey Cup, the league's championship. The following January, Terlep was named head coach of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, another CFL team, and given a two-year contract. During his first year at the helm, the team finished third in the Western Interprovincial Football Union, the league's western division, with a record of 7‚Äì7‚Äì2. The Roughriders lost in the semifinals of the conference playoffs to the Edmonton Eskimos, but Terlep was given a new two-year contract after the season. After losing the first 11 games of the 1959 season, however, Terlep was fired in September and replaced by Frank Tripucka. He immediately joined the Ottawa Rough Riders as backfield coach following his dismissal. Terlep was named Ottawa's general manager within three months of his hiring as an assistant, succeeding Jim McCaffrey. Terlep's responsibilities included recruiting and signing players to improve Ottawa's roster, and he was responsible for bringing quarterback Ron Lancaster to the CFL in 1960 on the advice of Bill Edwards, his former Vanderbilt colleague. Lancaster was viewed as too small in stature to play in the American professional leagues, but he became one of the most successful quarterbacks of his era in the CFL and is a member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. With Lancaster, the Rough Riders finished with a 9‚Äì5 regular-season record in 1960 and beat the Edmonton Eskimos 16-6 to win the 48th Grey Cup. The Rough Riders finished second in their division in 1961, but Terlep resigned after a 6-7-1 season in 1962 and was replaced by the team's former wide receiver Red O'Quinn. Terlep, who hosted a radio and television program about football, had clashed with Rough Riders head coach Frank Clair over the team's play-calling. Later life and death Terlep left football in 1962 and went back to Elkhart, where he ran a recreational vehicle and mobile homes business. He retired in 1985 and moved to Florida, where he died in 2010 of cancer. He and his wife Alma had three sons and two daughters. Terlep was inducted into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1985. He is also a member of the Elkhart County Sports Hall of Fame.

It was directed by W. S. Van Dyke and written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, based on a novel by Arthur Somers Roche. The film was later remade as the more sanitized Society Lawyer (1939), without the risqu√© pre-Code dialogue. Plot Attorney Jack Durant (Warner Baxter) successfully defends racketeer Tony Gaziotti (Nat Pendleton) against a high-profile murder charge and waives his fee. His staid law firm feels his taking the racketeer on as a client reflects badly on them; when he refuses to give up his exciting new line of work, they go their separate ways. His upper class girlfriend Sue Leonard (Martha Sleeper) turns down his proposal and breaks up with him for the same reason. Shortly afterward, Sue agrees to marry Tom Siddall (Phillips Holmes), but only if he gives up his mistress, Mimi Montagne (Mae Clarke). Although Tom offers Mimi a generous settlement, she becomes furious. Mimi quickly returns to her former lover, gangster Jim Crelliman (C. Henry Gordon). He has her get Tom to meet her at a raucous party. After they go out on the balcony to talk, a shot is heard; the revelers find Mimi dead, and Tom with a revolver in his hand. A pawnbroker named Levitoff tells the police that he sold Tom the gun the same day. Sue begs Jack to defend Tom. He agrees, even though he gets an anonymous phone call telling him to stay out of it. Jack asks Tony to find out what he can. Tony introduces him to Gertie Waxted (Myrna Loy), who was Mimi's friend and at the party. She tells him that she arrived after the murder, but he thinks she still may know something useful, so he invites her to spend the night in his suite. To her great surprise, however, he sleeps on the couch. The next morning, Sue asks Jack to drop the case because she has received a call threatening his life. When Gertie appears in Jack's robe, Sue hastily departs, even though Gertie tells her that Jack is still in love with her. Jack questions the pawnbroker without success. After he leaves, Levitoff is murdered. Jack goes to Gertie's apartment (directly across from the murder scene) to get some clothes for her. Crelliman shows up and offers him $200,000 to take a long vacation. When Jack turns him down, Crelliman threatens him. Jack leaves and breaks into the apartment directly above Gertie's, which he has learned belongs to Murtoch (George E. Stone), one of Crelliman's gunmen. From the entry and exit wounds on Mimi's body, he is sure the murderer was situated higher up; the angle from Murtoch's window is about right. A helpful elevator operator warns Jim that Crelliman's men are waiting for him in the lobby and leads him to the service elevator. Jack sees Gertie in a club with Murtoch and jumps to conclusions. When she returns to Jack's apartment, he is mad until she tells him that she had to get Murtoch out of his apartment so Jack would not run into him when he broke in. He apologizes and admits he has fallen in love with her. He asks Gertie to marry him, but they are interrupted by a phone call from Tony, who has found out that Crelliman has decided to have Murtoch killed. Jack takes along Police Lieutenant \\"Steve\\" Stevens (Robert Emmett O'Connor) and several of his men to trick Murtoch into confessing. Gertie volunteers to lure Crelliman out onto the roof of the other building. After capturing Murtoch, Jack tells him that they will frame him for Crelliman's impending murder. Murtoch eventually cracks and confesses. Meanwhile, Gertie tells Crelliman that she frightened Jack into accepting his offer, but he does not believe her and tells his men to take her \\"for a ride\\". Jack and the police hear gunfire. When they rush over, they find Crelliman and his henchmen all dead. Gertie and Tony are in the next room. Tony saved Gertie, but he himself collapses and dies from a gunshot wound. Later, Gertie is packing to leave, thinking that Jack is getting back together with Sue. He tells Gertie that he wants to marry her and take her to Europe. When she reminds him she is no lady, he tells her she will do until one comes along.

It involved some 500 Cornish rebels who fought on the Royalist side against the Parliamentarian forces of Sir Hardress Waller. Cornish forces had fought on the Royalist side in the defence of the Duchy against the New Model Army in the Civil War and had perceived it as a war of national liberation against the English Parliament, which the Cornish ultimately lost. After the English Civil War, taxes were increased to fund military installations but many in Cornwall rebelled against this and took to arms. Following the killing of 70 Cornish Royalists in Penzance on 16 May 1648, the people of Mullion sent 120 men, who marched to Goonhilly Downs and then to St Keverne and Mawgan, collecting 300 more foot soldiers and 40 horsemen. West Britons: Cornish identities and the early modern British state, Mark Stoyle There was a battle against Parliamentarian forces under the control of Sir Hardress Waller which ultimately led to the defeat of the Cornish forces near Gear Camp, a nearby earthwork of the Celtic Iron Age that overlooked the Helford River.

From 1996 till 2003 it was owned by UCMG; in 2004 Mole Listening Pearls was overtaken by Daredo Music. The name \\"Mole\\" is from the novel \\"Neuromancer\\" in which mole is a kind of computer virus. Since 1996 various artists of electronic music, like Alphawezen, Bassface Sascha, De-Phazz, Lemongrass, moodorama, Naomi, Wax Tailor, Barbara Lahr, Yonderboi and Zagar have been released on this label. The first records were compilations. On \\"Science Jazz Vol. 1\\", arranged by the Zurich DJ Minus 8, you could find artists like Nightmares on Wax, LTJ Bukem and Lamb, on \\"Breaking The Ice\\" you can find, among others, Kruder & Dorfmeister and Red Snapper. From 1997 on individual artists have been signed by this label. The debut album \\"Detunized Gravity\\" (1997) by De-Phazz and Yonderboi's debut album \\"Shallow and Profound\\" were a big success, as they sold over 30 000 copies. As of August 2008, 84 albums of 31 Bands have been released. Still, various compilations will be released. These compilations act as an overview of all artists and their production on one hand, and there are a number of programmatical demands for certain music styles on the other. For instance \\"Batacuda\\" ‚Äì already three follow-ups have been released between 2000 and 2007 ‚Äì has afro-percussive influenced tracks, while \\"Science Fiction Jazz\\" with its eleven editions between 1996 until 2008, made a fundamental contribution to the evolution of NuJazz.

With the exception of members of the Botswana Defence Force, Botswana Police Service, Local Police, and Prison Service, all workers have the right to join unions. However, in practice trade unions complain of difficulties in operating unfettered. The 2004 Trade Disputes Act is seen by unions as \\"employer-favoured\\" and requires submitting grievances to a complex procedure which, it is claimed, invariably results in strike action being declared illegal. History Formed in 1948, the Francistown African Employees' Union (FAEU), led by G. M. K. Mmusi was the first trade union in Botswana. It existed until 1970, although only being recognised by the Bechuanaland Protectorate in 1964. The Bechuanaland Protectorate Union, led by Lenyeletse Seretse, was formed in 1959, and in 1962 the Bechuanaland Trade Union Congress (BTUC) was established, with Klaas K. Motshidisi as general secretary. The BTUC, which was allied with the Bechuanaland People's Party, foundered three years later, in 1965; and after independence in 1966, with the help of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (now ITUC), trade unions in Botswana formed the Bechuanaland Federation of Labour. In the 1970s the Botswana Trade Union and Education Centre was created, and it was replaced in 1977 by the current national trade union centre, the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU). Present day The BFTU is still the sole national trade union centre in Botswana. Most unions are organized at the enterprise level, with few resources available for cross-enterprise structures such as industrial or craft unionism. The government of Botswana appears to take a pragmatic approach to trade unions, arguing that they should be formed in order to encourage fair labour practices, facilitate education of workers, and reduce conflicts between individual employees and employers.

Early life The eldest son of Sir Richard Proby and Betty Monica Murray. He was raised on the 3,700-acre family estate, Elton Hall, near Oundle. Peter was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford. Career After graduating from Oxford, he worked for the China trading firm of Jardine Matheson for four years, traveling between company posts on the Yangtze, leaving China in 1938. He enlisted in the Irish Guards upon the outbreak of World War II, spending most of his career in military intelligence interpreting aerial photographs and interrogating captured German airmen. After the war, Proby qualified as a land agent, and then managed the family estate. In 1953, Proby was offered the bursarship of Eton. During his tenure there, several new buildings were erected, including Villiers and Farrer houses, and the college chapel was renovated after an infestation of death watch beetle. Proby was noted for his skilled financial management of these projects, and for his enthusiasm for new technology. After retiring from the bursarship in 1971, he returned to the management of Elton and engaged in local affairs. Proby inherited his father's baronetcy in 1979, and in 1981, after a year as a deputy lieutenant, was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. He left that office in 1985.

The novels are situated at an unstated time in the future where humans have colonized many distant worlds. In addition, treaties with alien races allow for the extradition of humans to other worlds to stand trial. Since most of these extraspecies crimes carry a sentence of death, an industry has sprung up to hide these people. Those who vanish are called the Disappeared. Not everyone who disappears does so to hide from aliens' justice, some are hiding from human justice, others just want to escape from their past. Two professions have sprung up to find those people: Trackers and Retrieval Artists. Trackers, similar to bounty hunters, seek the disappeared and return them to justice, or to those willing to pay for them to be found again. Retrieval Artists also seek the disappeared, but instead of dragging them back to justice, are more often hired by lawyers seeking to have inheritances delivered (minus the sum it cost to find them). Frequently, retrieval artist are followed by trackers in order to find the individual being sought. Plot summary During a marathon race that takes place on the Moon in the future, a corpse is discovered lying in the path the runners take. Noelle DeRicci, a detective, is sent to investigate. The corpse is initially identified as Jane Zweig, a famous business person who operates an extraterrestrial \\"extreme sports\\" corporation. Miles Flint, the Retrieval Artist who used to work for DeRicci, is almost simultaneously hired to also look for Frieda Tey, who they think has been living under the name Jane Zweig. Frieda Tey had been hiding from the results of her biological experiments. The most infamous being a virus that killed more than 200 subjects in an experiment reminiscent of the work of Josef Mengele. By the time that the police determine that the murder scene was staged, the fast-acting virus that Tey had used on Io was starting to affect the runners in the marathon.

Hubka (born 1946) is an American architectural historian whose primary focus is vernacular architecture and related issues of architecture and cultural meaning. Hubka received his Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1969, and his Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) from the University of Oregon in 1972. While at Carnegie Mellon, he was a varsity football player and played quarterback. He taught at the University of Oregon from 1972 to 1983. From 1987 to 2011, he was a professor in the Department of Architecture at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. After retiring in 2011, he moved to Portland, Oregon. He is currently an adjunct faculty member in the Architecture program at Portland State University. Although Hubka is trained as an architect, he was an early advocate for widening architectural history research to include vernacular architecture. He is best known for his work on connected farm buildings in New England. His book Big House, Little House, Back House, Barn was the 1985 winner of the \\"Abbott Lowell Cummings Award\\" of the Vernacular Architecture Forum. Hubka's research on eastern European synagogues, begun in the mid-1980s, addressed 18th century wooden synagogues of Eastern Europe emphasizing the relationships between Jewish culture and eastern European contextual factors. This research received significant funding support from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and led to his 2003 book, Resplendent Synagogue: Architecture and Worship in an Eighteenth-century Polish Community, which won the \\"Henry Glassie Award\\" of the Vernacular Architecture Forum in 2006. The book also received an honorable mention from the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies (AAASS)/Orbis Books prize committee in 2004. In recent years Hubka has researched workers' housing in Milwaukee and other cities. This research led to his book Houses Without Names: Architectural Nomenclature and the Classification of America's Common Houses published in 2013. Hubka served on the Wisconsin Historic Preservation Review Board for twelve years; during this time he chaired its Architecture Committee. The ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) honored Hubka with the ACSA Distinguished Professor Award in 2009-10.ACSA Archives, Distinguished Professor Award winners.

This includes a number of streets through the city of Minneapolis. CR 1‚ÄìCR 25 County Road 1 serves Bloomington and Eden Prairie. On its east end, it starts as 24th Avenue South, at Interstate 494, and heads south adjacent to the Mall of America. It then continues as Old Shakopee Road (and a short bit of 98th Street) for the rest of its route through the south side of Bloomington. Old Shakopee Road was once an Indian trail connecting Fort Snelling with Shakopee. Many of the structures in Bloomington's history were built on Old Shakopee Road, including the town hall (1892), the Baillif hotel and store, and a Grange hall. Old Shakopee Road itself used to be parts of Constitutional Routes 5 and 52. On the western border of Bloomington, County Road 1 turns north, follows U.S. Highway 169 for a short distance, and then becomes Pioneer Trail, crossing Eden Prairie to the Carver County line and continuing as Carver County Road 14. County Road 2 is Penn Avenue North in north Minneapolis from Interstate 394 to 44th Avenue North (County Road 152). St. Louis Park, 2014. The nearest intersection shown is at France Avenue (Hennepin County Road 17). County Road 3 begins in Minneapolis at the Mississippi River, and follows Lake Street west through most of Minneapolis. Just west of Lake Calhoun, it turns southwest and follows Excelsior Boulevard. (The north branch of this \\"Y\\"-shaped intersection is a continuation of Lake Street and is County Road 25.) Excelsior Boulevard continues westward through St. Louis Park, Hopkins, and into Minnetonka, ending at County Road 101, just east of its namesake town of Excelsior. Lake Street was originally used as a path for soldiers traveling from Fort Snelling to Lake Calhoun. In 1856, the Minnesota Territorial Legislature established a territorial road \\"from Minneapolis to Glencoe via Lake Calhoun, near Bass Lake, to John P. Miller's, and then by the way of Excelsior to Glencoe, to be known as the Glencoe Road.\\" This was known as Territorial Road #3. Pioneers used this road as an oxcart trail to travel to Carver County and McLeod County. Around 1935, State Highway 7 (MN 7) was built north of Excelsior Boulevard, and the segment west of State Highway 100 (MN 100) reverted to county control. East of Highway 100 remained under state control as part of U.S. Highway 169, to which U.S. Highway 212 was added in 1934. U.S. 169 was moved off Excelsior Boulevard around 1981, while U.S. 212 was moved off around 1983. Segments of Excelsior Boulevard and Lake Street remained under state maintenance until 1988. County Road 4 runs along Eden Prairie Road from southern Minnetonka to Eden Prairie to County Road 1, where a newly completed section of road connects County Road 4 to Spring Road, eliminating an overlapping stretch with County Road 1. County Road 4 then follows Spring Road to Flying Cloud Drive (old U.S. Highway 212). County Road 5 is divided into two disjointed sections. The western section is Minnetonka Boulevard from County Road 101 in western Minnetonka to the junction with County Road 25 and France Avenue South at the border between St. Louis Park and Minneapolis. The eastern section is Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis from Lyndale Avenue South to East River Road, where County Road 5 follows 27th Avenue South to University Avenue S.E. Previous sections of County Road 5 turned over to municipal control include a section west of County Road 101 to Vine Hill Road in Deephaven, following Vine Hill Road to State Highway 7 (MN 7), and a section that connected the two disjoint sections of County Road 5, passing between Cedar Lake and Lake Of The Isles in Minneapolis. County Road 6 begins at State Highway 55 (MN 55) in Plymouth and runs through northern Orono and southern Independence before crossing the Carver County line and continuing as Carver County Road 20. County Road 8 is West Broadway Avenue between County Road 9 in Robbinsdale and County Road 130 in Brooklyn Park, about 1/4 mile beyond an intersection with County Road 81. Most of County Road 8 was an original state highway that later became part of U.S. Highway 10, but the state built a new roadway in 1934 to replace what is now County Road 8. County Road 9 is Rockford Road from County Road 152 in north Minneapolis to State Highway 55 (MN 55) in Plymouth, where it continues beyond Highway 55 as County Road 24. Most of this highway was the original route of Highway 55 until the current Highway 55 between Medina and downtown Minneapolis was built in 1954. County Road 10 runs along Bass Lake Road from State Highway 100 (MN 100) in Brooklyn Center to County Road 101 in Maple Grove, then extending westward through Corcoran, Burschville, and Greenfield before ending at County Road 50 in Rockford. County Road 11 begins in Loretto and runs through northern Independence and past the Lake Rebecca Park Reserve before crossing the Wright County line and continuing as Wright County Road 30 into Delano. County Road 12 is Noble Parkway from County Road 109 / 85th Avenue North in Brooklyn Park to 109th Avenue North, then follows West River Road through Champlin to a 1/4-mile concurrent stretch with U.S. Highway 169, then follows Dayton River Road through Dayton, where it continues into Wright County as Wright County Road 42. The West River Road segment of County Road 12 was previously old U.S. 169 until the late 1970s, then part of State Highway 252 (MN 252) until State Highway 610 (MN 610) was completed in 1999 between the Richard P. Braun Bridge and Osseo. Much of County Road 12 is concurrent with the Great River Road throughout Champlin and Dayton in northern Hennepin County. County Road 13 is Brockton Lane in Dayton between the County Road 81 / County Road 101 junction and County Road 12. This road was previously State Highway 101 (MN 101) until Highway 101 was rerouted to its current route about 1 mile west in 1968. County Road 14 is Zane Avenue North from Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park to West River Road in Champlin. County Road 14 originally extended southeast along Brooklyn Boulevard, through Brooklyn Center, to the Minneapolis city line, before old State Highway 152 (MN 152) was created in 1934. County Road 15 is divided into two disjoint sections. The western section begins at the west junction of U.S. Highway 12 in Wayzata and heads westward through Minnetonka Beach, Spring Park, Mound, and Minnetrista before crossing the Carver County line and continuing as Carver County Road 24. The eastern section is Gleason Lake Road from the east junction of U.S. 12 in Wayzata to Vicksburg Lane at the Plymouth / Minnetonka border. Previous sections of County Road 15 include a section connecting the two disjoint sections of County Road 15 along Shoreline Drive, Lake Street East, Superior Boulevard, and Wayzata Boulevard in Wayzata, and a section extending east of Vicksburg Lane along Gleason Lake Road and Sunset Trail in Plymouth to State Highway 55 (MN 55). County Road 16 begins at the intersection of Interstate 494 and County Road 5 and runs alongside Interstate 494 to McGinty Road, where it follows McGinty Road to County Road 101 in Wayzata. Previous segments of County 16 include a westward extension along McGinty Road to Superior Boulevard in Wayzata and an eastward extension along County Road 5 and County Road 61, then east along Cedar Lake Road to Glenwood Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. This east segment was re-routed at various times due to the upgrade of U.S. Highway 12 (now Interstate 394) in downtown Minneapolis to freeway standards and to the construction of Interstate 494. County Road 17 is France Avenue South between Excelsior Boulevard in Minneapolis and Old Shakopee Road in Bloomington. There was a second disjoint section of County 17 that ran along France Avenue between Minnetonka Boulevard and Cedar Lake Road in Minneapolis. The segment of County 17 between Excelsior Boulevard and West 54th Street. (later shortened to West 50th Street) was previously old State Highway 121 (MN 121). County Road 18 was a former county route that ran from the Bloomington Ferry Bridge northbound to Osseo. It was renumbered in 1988 as part of the new alignment of U.S. Highway 169 in the Minneapolis area. U.S. 169 was rerouted along the former route of County 18. Present day County Road 18 is now 5th Avenue North in Hopkins. County Road 19 begins at State Highway 7 (MN 7) in Excelsior and dissects Lake Minnetonka through Tonka Bay and Orono, then continues northward through Independence, Maple Plain, Medina, Loretto, Corcoran, and Hanover, before crossing into Wright County at the Crow River and continuing northward as Wright County Road 19 through St. Michael and Albertville. County Road 20 is Blake Road between State Highway 7 (MN 7) and Excelsior Boulevard in Hopkins. A previous segment of County Road 20 extended southward along Blake Road from Excelsior Boulevard to Interlachen Boulevard, then following Interlachen Boulevard to Vernon Avenue near the interchange of Vernon Avenue with State Highway 100 (MN 100). Another previous segment was a disjoint segment in Minneapolis beginning at France Avenue and followed 44th Street, Sheridan Avenue, Lake Calhoun Parkway, 35th Street, and Hennepin Avenue, ending at the Lowry Hill Tunnel. County Road 21 is West 50th Street from France Avenue South to Lyndale Avenue South in Minneapolis. This segment was previously a part of State Highway 190, then later old State Highway 121 (MN 121). County Road 21 was numbered to maintain identity with the former Highway 121. County Road 22 is Lyndale Avenue South from West 58th Street (at the end of present-day State Highway 121 / MN 121) to Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis (near the Lowry Hill Tunnel). The segment from Franklin Avenue to Lake Street was previously the routing of old U.S. Highway 169 until the late 1970s. The segment from Lake Street to West 58th Street was previously old U.S. Highway 65, then old State Highway 190. When Highway 190 was decommissioned, Highway 121 was rerouted along Lyndale Avenue South from West 50th Street to West 58th Street, then turned over to Hennepin County maintenance when Highway 121 was shortened to the freeway stub from the intersection of Lyndale Avenue South and West 58th Street to the interchange of Interstate 35W and State Highway 62 (MN 62) at the Minneapolis / Richfield city boundary line. County Road 23 is Marshall Street NE from Hennepin Avenue to 37th Avenue NE in Minneapolis, where it continues northward into Anoka County and Fridley as East River Road (Anoka County Road 1). The segment of County Road 23 to the north of Plymouth Avenue is concurrent with the Great River Road. County Road 24 begins at the intersection of State Highway 55 (MN 55) and County Road 9 in Plymouth and runs west through Medina before ending at County Road 19 in the Baker Park Reserve. County Road 25 is the decommissioned segment of old State Highway 7 (MN 7) between State Highway 100 (MN 100) in St. Louis Park and the intersection of Lake Street and Excelsior Boulevard near Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis. CR 26‚ÄìCR 50 County Road 26 (non-CSAH) is a road in Minnetrista that begins at County 110 and extends westward to the Carver County line, where it continues as an unnumbered road for approximately 1/4 mile before it ends at Carver County Road 20. County Road 27 is two disjoint sections of Stinson Boulevard in Minneapolis. The northern section runs from 37th Avenue NE to St. Anthony Boulevard. The southern section runs from New Brighton Boulevard to Hennepin Avenue. County Road 28 is East Bush Lake Road and Bush Lake Road in Bloomington from Interstate 494 to County 1. This road provides access to the Hyland-Bush- Anderson Lakes Park Reserve. County Road 29 is Town Line Road in Maple Plain from U.S. Highway 12 to County 19. This is a stub that allows travelers from Baker Park Reserve via County 19 more direct access to U.S. 12 by bypassing residential areas of Maple Plain. County Road 30 follows 93rd Avenue North from Zane Avenue (County 14) in Brooklyn Park to Interstate 94 in Maple Grove, then extending westward to 97th Avenue North in Corcoran before ending at County 19. A previous section of County 30 extended eastward along 93rd Avenue North past Zane Avenue North (at one time running concurrently with Zane Avenue North, then 95th Avenue North, then back to 93rd Avenue North via two sharp curves) to West River Road. This section was shortened to State Highway 252 (MN 252) upon the opening of the State Highway 610 (MN 610) bridge over the Mississippi River in 1987, then decommissioned upon the extension of Highway 610 to Osseo in 1999. County Road 31 is Xerxes Avenue South from West 50th Street (County 21) in Minneapolis to West 66th Street in Edina, then York Avenue South to West 76th Street, then back to Xerxes Avenue South to American Boulevard in Bloomington. County Road 32 is Penn Avenue South from State Highway 62 (MN 62) in Richfield to Old Shakopee Road (County 1) in Bloomington. A previous segment of County 32 extended north of Highway 62 to West 50th Street in Minneapolis. County Road 33 is Park Avenue South in Minneapolis from West 46th Street to Washington Avenue (County 152). This route is one-way northbound. Southbound traffic uses the parallel Portland Avenue South (County 35). County Road 34 is Normandale Boulevard in Bloomington from the intersection of Interstate 494 and State Highway 100 (MN 100) to Old Shakopee Road (County 1). A previous segment of County 34 extended beyond Old Shakopee Road to the Dan Patch Line Bridge, a combined highway / railroad bridge across the Minnesota River that was closed to vehicular traffic in the late 1970s. County Road 35 is Portland Avenue South from Washington Avenue in downtown Minneapolis to Old Shakopee Road (County 1) in Bloomington. The segment of County 35 from Washington Avenue to West 46th Street is one-way southbound. Northbound traffic in this segment is diverted to Park Avenue South (County 33). County Road 36 is University Avenue S.E. in Minneapolis from Interstate 35W to the Saint Paul city limits boundary line. The segment of County 36 from Interstate 35W to Oak Street is one-way eastbound. Westbound traffic uses the parallel 4th Street S.E. (County 37). Interstate 35W was closed south of its interchange with County 36 after the August 1, 2007 bridge collapse, and reopened upon completion of the replacement bridge on September 18, 2008. An anomaly existed in the late-1980s and early-1990s when old U.S. 52 was routed on University Avenue, then was turned to county maintenance and became County 36 (and 37 on 4th Street S.E.), creating a gap in U.S. 52. U.S. 52 became a continuous route again when it was rerouted along Interstate 94 from downtown Minneapolis to downtown Saint Paul in 1995. County Road 37 is 4th Street S.E. in Minneapolis from Oak Street to Interstate 35W. This route is one-way westbound. Eastbound traffic uses University Avenue S.E. (County 36). County Road 38 was 38th Street in Minneapolis from Hiawatha Avenue (State Highway 55 / MN 55) to Lyndale Avenue South (County 22) and 35th Street from Lyndale Avenue South to Hennepin Avenue South, now maintained by the city of Minneapolis. County Road 39 is Valley View Road in Eden Prairie between CR 60 (Mitchell Road) and U.S. Highway 212 (Flying Cloud Drive). It crosses Interstate 494 at exit number 12. A previous segment of County 39 extended beyond U.S. 212 to U.S. Highway 169. County Road 40 is Glenwood Avenue from State Highway 55 (MN 55) in Golden Valley to 8th Street near the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis. County Road 42 is East 42nd Street in Minneapolis from Cedar Avenue (County 152) to Minnehaha Avenue (County 48). County Road 43 is Lagoon Avenue in Minneapolis from Dupont Avenue South to E. Lake Calhoun Parkway. Formerly a two-way city street, this was converted to one-way westbound to handle westbound traffic on Lake Street (County 3) due to high traffic volume in the area. County 3 between E. Lake Calhoun Parkway and Dupont Avenue South is one-way eastbound. County Road 44 runs from State Highway 7 (MN 7) in Minnetrista to County 110 in Mound, passing between Halsted Bay and Priests Bay in Lake Minnetonka. County Road 46 is two disjoint sections of East 46th Street in Minneapolis. The first section runs from Lyndale Avenue South (County 22) to Cedar Avenue (County 152). This route was previously old State Highway 190 before Highway 190 was shifted to another route, then decommissioned. The second section runs between Minnehaha Avenue and the Ford Bridge over the Mississippi River towards Saint Paul, where it turns into Ramsey County Road 42. County Road 47 is 62nd Avenue North in Plymouth from Brockton Lane (County Road 101) to Northwest Boulevard (County Road 61). County Road 48 is Minnehaha Avenue in Minneapolis from East 46th Street (County 46) to East 28th Street, then 26th Avenue South from East 28th Street to Franklin Avenue (County 5). County Road 49 was a route that ran along South Diamond Lake Road in Dayton from County 12 to County 13, then ran concurrent with County 13 to 129th Avenue North, then followed 129th Avenue North into Rogers. When Interstate 94 was constructed in the early 1970s, County 49 was rerouted north of 129th Avenue North along the north frontage road of Interstate 94 and terminated at State Highway 101 (MN 101), but Hennepin County continued to maintain the segment of 129th Avenue North in Rogers between County 150 and the present County 81 as County 49, creating an anomaly of two disjoint sections of County 49 that had their western termini on the same highway (County 150 and Highway 101 form 1 continuous road). Both disjoint segments of County 49 were decommissioned in 2006. County Road 50 begins at County 10 in Corcoran and runs through Greenfield to Rockford, where it then runs along the east bank of the Crow River through the Lake Rebecca Park Reserve to the Wright County line, where the road continues as Wright County Road 17 into Delano. CR 51‚ÄìCR 75 County Road 51 is North Shore Drive in Orono from County 15 to County 19, then running concurrent with County 19 along Shadywood Road to Sunset Drive, then following Sunset Drive back to County 15 in Spring Park. County Road 52 is used to indicate two separate roads that have no apparent connection to one another. The northern County 52 is Hennepin Avenue in Minneapolis from Washington Avenue (County 152) near the Hennepin Avenue Bridge to the Ramsey County line, where it continues as Larpenteur Avenue (Ramsey County Road 30). The southern County 52 is Nicollet Avenue South from East 61st Street in Minneapolis to Old Shakopee Road (County 1) in Bloomington. Previously, the southern segment of County 52 stretched north of East 61st Street to Lake Street in Minneapolis. County Road 53 is 66th Street from France Avenue South (County 17) in Edina to State Highway 77 (MN 77) in Richfield near the MSP airport. County Road 54 was 28th Avenue South in Minneapolis from Hiawatha Avenue (State Highway 55 / MN 55) to State Highway 62 (MN 62), now maintained by the city of Minneapolis. County Road 55 was Auto Club Road in Bloomington from Bloomington Ferry Road (then marked as County 18) to Normandale Boulevard (then County 34) When the new U.S. 169 Bloomington Ferry Bridge was opened in 1996, County 55 was decommissioned and turned over to city maintenance, along with the decommissioning of County 18 and the truncation of County 34 to County 1. County Road 57 begins at the intersection of State Highway 100 (MN 100) and County 10 in Brooklyn Center and follows 57th Avenue North to Humboldt Avenue, then follows Humboldt Avenue to 44th Avenue North (County 152) in Minneapolis. A previous segment of County 57 extended south of 44th Avenue North on Fremont Avenue to West Broadway (currently County 81). Fremont Avenue between 33rd Avenue and West Broadway is one-way southbound. Northbound traffic in this section uses Emerson Avenue (then County 58). County Road 58 was Emerson Avenue between West Broadway (currently County 81) and 33rd Avenue in Minneapolis. This is one-way northbound. Southbound traffic uses Fremont Avenue (then County 57). County Road 60 is Baker Road from Minnetonka Boulevard (County 5) in Minnetonka to State Highway 5 (MN 5) in Eden Prairie. County Road 61 runs north-south and has several alternate names along its route: * From its northern junction with County Road 130 in Maple Grove, it is known as Hemlock Lane. * Just north of its junction with County Road 10 (Bass Lake Road), just north of the boundary with Plymouth it becomes Northwest Boulevard and continues under that name until its junction with State Highway 55 (MN 55). * Between Highway 55 and the boundary with Minnetonka it is known as Xenium Lane. * Between the Minnetonka boundary and County Road 5 (Minnetonka Boulevard), it is known as Plymouth Road. * South of Minnetonka Boulevard, it changes names again to Shady Oak Road and continues into Eden Prairie. County Road 61 ends at U.S. Highway 212, but Shady Oak Road itself continues for a short distance into the \\"Golden Triangle\\" area of Eden Prairie and ends at Valley View Road. * Once U.S. Highway 212 was shifted onto its new freeway alignment in 2008 through Eden Prairie and Chaska, the old alignment (Flying Cloud Drive) took on the designation of County Road 61 continuing to the county line with Carver County. County Road 62 is Townline Road on the Eden Prairie / Minnetonka boundary line from the intersection of Interstate 494 and State Highway 62 (MN 62) to County 101. Before 1988, County 62 included the current State Highway 62 (which was numbered after County 62 to maintain identity despite the existence of another State Highway 62 in southwestern Minnesota). County 62 was extended west of Baker Road (County 60) to County 101 upon reconstruction of Townline Road in the mid-1980s. County Road 66 begins at Douglas Drive (County 102) in Golden Valley and follows Duluth Street to Golden Valley Road, then follows Golden Valley Road to West Broadway in north Minneapolis, then follows West Broadway and Broadway Street to Stinson Boulevard. (County 27). The segment of West Broadway between Golden Valley Road and Washington Avenue runs concurrent with County 81 and is signed in this segment as County 81 only. County Road 67 was the current County 62 from Baker Road (County 60) to Interstate 494 on the Eden Prairie / Minnetonka boundary line. This road was renumbered as County 62 when the segment of then-County 62 (now State Highway 62 / MN 62) between Shady Oak Road (County 61) and Interstate 494 opened in 1986 and County 62 was then extended westward. County Road 68 was Main Street in Hopkins from Excelsior Boulevard (County 3) to Washington Avenue (former County 18), decommissioned and partially removed when then-County 18 (now U.S. Highway 169) was upgraded to a freeway between Minnetonka Boulevard (County 5) and 7th Street West. County Road 70 is Medicine Lake Road along the boundary line of Golden Valley with Crystal and New Hope from Douglas Drive (County 102) to U.S. Highway 169. A previous section of County 70 extended into Plymouth west of U.S. 169 (then County 18) along Medicine Lake Road to East Medicine Lake Boulevard, then along East Medicine Lake Boulevard to South Shore Drive, then South Shore Drive through the city of Medicine Lake to State Highway 55 (MN 55). County Road 73 begins at State Highway 7 (MN 7) in Hopkins and follows Hopkins Crossroad through Minnetonka to Sunset Trail (formerly Gleason Lake Road, and Country Road 15) in Plymouth, then Sunset Trail to State Highway 55 (MN 55). CR 76‚ÄìCR 100 County Road 81 in Brooklyn Park, heading southbound.County Road 81 runs from MN 101 (Main Street) in Rogers to Washington Avenue North in Minneapolis, turned over to Hennepin County maintenance along with part of old State Highway 101 (MN 101) in the 1988 highway swap for what is now U.S. Highway 169 and State Highway 62 (MN 62). Portions of County Road 81 are known in the present day as West Broadway and Bottineau Boulevard. The route was once maintained by the state, and formerly known as US 52, US 169, MN 101, MN 152 and MN 218 at various points in time prior to 1988. County Road 82 is Mill Street in Shorewood from State Highway 7 (MN 7) to the Carver County line, where it continues as Carver County Road 17.

County Road 84 is a series of roads in Orono beginning at North Shore Drive (County 51) and passing north of Stubbs Bay on Lake Minnetonka before ending at County 19. County Road 88 is New Brighton Boulevard from Broadway Street in Minneapolis to the Ramsey County line in St. Anthony, where it continues as an unmarked state-maintained highway that merges into Interstate 35W. This route was previously old U.S. Highway 8 before 1981 and State Highway 88 between 1981 and 1996, when Hennepin County maintenance took over its section of County 88. County Road 90 runs between County 11 and County 6 in Independence. County Road 92 is a series of roads beginning at County 50 in Rockford, passing through Greenfield, Independence, Minnetrista, and St. Bonifacius before ending at the Carver County line and continuing as Carver County Road 92. County Road 93 is 37th Avenue NE in St. Anthony between Silver Lake Road (County 136) and the Ramsey County line, where it continues as County Road D. County Road 94 is 29th Avenue NE in St. Anthony between New Brighton Boulevard (County 88) and the Ramsey County line, where it continues as County Road C. CR 101 and up County Road 101 is a segment of old State Highway 101 turned over to Hennepin County maintenance in segments from County Road 81 to Wayzata in 1988 and from Wayzata to the Carver County line in 1998, where a disjointed southern section of State Highway 101 still exists.

County Road 103 is West Broadway in Brooklyn Park from Brooklyn Boulevard (County 130 and County 152) to State Highway 610 (MN 610), then Winnetka Avenue North from Highway 610 to West River Road (County 12) in Champlin. County 103 ran concurrent with County 30 from West Broadway to Winnetka Avenue North until the Highway 610 overpass was completed in the late 1990s. County Road 109 is 85th Avenue North from State Highway 252 (MN 252) in Brooklyn Park to Zachary Lane in Maple Grove, then Weaver Lake Road from Zachary Lane to Interstate 94 in Maple Grove. County 109 extended eastward to West River Road before Highway 252 was realigned from West River Road to its current route in the mid-1980s. Another previous segment of County 109 extended on Weaver Lake Road from County 130 (intersecting near the then- uncompleted Interstate 94) to West Fish Lake Road, then followed West Fish Lake Road to County 10. County 109 between Interstate 94 and Zachary Lane was realigned from a road with many sharp curves in a gravel pit area to its current, straighter route in the early 1990s. County Road 110 begins at the intersection of County 6 and County 83 in Independence and passes through Minnetrista to Mound, where it shifts from a north-south route to an east-west route back into Minnetrista, ending at County 92 north of St. Bonifacius. Prior to the mid-1950s, this route and County Road 83 were originally State Highway 110. County Road 112 follows the old route of U.S. 12 through Orono and Long Lake. It starts at County Road 6 in Orono and travels through Long Lake, crossing Brown Road (County 146) and ends at U.S. 12 at the Wayzata city limit. County Road 115 (non-CSAH) is Hamel Road in Medina from County 19 to County 116. As with County 9, this was also part of the original alignment of State Highway 55 (MN 55) until Highway 55 was realigned north of this route in the 1950s. County Road 116 begins at Hamel Road (County 115) in Medina, then passes through Corcoran to Territorial Road in the unincorporated town of Fletcher, then follows Territorial Road to the Wright County line at the Crow River, where it becomes Wright County Road 22. The current County 116 bridge over the Crow River replaces an older bridge that was prone to flooding. County Road 117 (non-CSAH) is 109th Avenue North on the border between Corcoran and Rogers (formerly Hassan Township) from County 116 to County 19. County Road 118 (non-CSAH) is Arrowhead Drive in Medina from County Road 115 to State Highway 55 (MN 55). County Road 121 is Fernbrook Lane from County 30 in Maple Grove to 129th Avenue North in Dayton, where it shifts from a north-south route to an east- west route and follows 129th Avenue North and French Lake Road into Champlin, where it ends at County 12. A second disjoint segment of County 121 opened in 2007 along Hayden Lake Road in Champlin from U.S. Highway 169 to a park entrance to Elm Creek Park Reserve. These two segments of County 121 will be connected upon opening a bridge over Elm Creek in late 2008, turning back part of French Lake Road to Champlin city maintenance when the bridge opens. County Road 122 is former State Highway 122 across the Mississippi River on the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis, and is partly built to freeway standards. County Road 123 begins at County 10 in Greenfield and ends at County 19 in Hanover near the County 19 bridge and the historic 1885 Hanover Bridge over the Crow River. County Road 125 is Bartlett Boulevard in Mound from County 110 to Wilshire Boulevard (not to be confused with the Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA) then follows Wilshire Boulevard to County 15 in Spring Park. County Road 130 begins at Brooklyn Boulevard (County 152) in Brooklyn Center and follows 69th Avenue North to County 8, then follows West Broadway back to Brooklyn Boulevard, then follows Brooklyn Boulevard and Elm Creek Boulevard to the intersection of County Road 30 in Maple Grove. Elm Creek Boulevard was completed to County 81 in early 2008, but has yet to be signed as County 130. The original alignment of County 130 was 69th Avenue North from West River Road in Brooklyn Center to the east end of Eagle Lake in Maple Grove, then a road north of Eagle Lake and Cedar Island Lake to County 109, then Berkshire Lane (now Rice Lake Road) between County 109 and County 30. This original route was significantly altered due to the construction of Interstate 94 in the 1960s and the development of Maple Grove in the 1980s-90s, resulting in a period of two disjoint sections of County 130 between the mid-1970s and 2005. County Road 135 is a road in Orono that begins at County 15 and passes between Maxwell Bay, Stubbs Bay, and the north arm of Crystal Bay on Lake Minnetonka before ending at County 84.

County Road 151 is a route in Minnetrista and Orono that starts at County 110 and passes County 19 before traveling south and hits County 19 again, where it ends. It is known as North Arm Drive and West Branch Road. County Road 152 is the former route of State Highway 152 (MN 152) from County 81 in Brooklyn Park to the intersection of Washington Avenue and Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, then follows Washington Avenue to the Seven Corners area of the U of M West Bank, then follows Cedar Avenue from Washington Avenue to the intersection of State Highways 62 (MN 62) and 77 (MN 77). This segment of Cedar Avenue South is a decommissioned segment of State Highway 77 (and earlier State Highway 36 / MN 36 prior to 1982). Interstate 35W was closed north of its interchange with County 152 following the August 1, 2007 bridge collapse, and reopened on September 18, 2008, upon completion of the replacement bridge. County Road 153 is Lowry Avenue in Minneapolis from West Broadway (County 81) to Silver Lake Road (County 136). The stretch of County 153 between West Broadway and Lyndale Avenue North was previously part of old State Highway 278 until 1982. County Road 154 was West Medicine Lake Drive between State Highway 55 (MN 55) and Rockford Road (County 9) in Plymouth. The northern part of this route was reconstructed as Northwest Boulevard (currently County 61) during the mid-1980s, while the southern part was turned over to Plymouth city maintenance. County Road 156 is Winnetka Avenue North between State Highway 55 (MN 55) in Golden Valley to Bass Lake Road (County 10) in New Hope.

County Road 157 is a short route partially along the Hennepin County / Wright County line (and just north of Carver County) that connects Hennepin County Road 6 with Wright County Road 17. This includes the segment of road along the county line that is under Hennepin County maintenance / jurisdiction. County Road 158 runs between State Highway 62 (MN 62) and State Highway 100 (MN 100) in Edina, via Gleason Road and Vernon Avenue. The roadway had carried old U.S. 169 and old U.S. 212 through Edina until 1968. The two routes were then moved to what is now Highway 62. County Road 159 (non-CSAH) is Territorial Road in Rogers (formerly Hassan Township) from County 101 to County 116. Park Access Road 201 (park access road signs are a white-on-brown inverse isosceles trapezoid) runs along the eastern side of the Baker Park Reserve beginning at County 6 in Orono, following Homestead Trail, County 24, and Parkview Drive, and ending at County 115 in Medina. Park Access Road 202 begins at County 81 in Maple Grove and follows Zachary Lane into the Elm Creek Park Reserve, then follows Goose Lake Road to Elm Creek Road, then follows Elm Creek Road to County 121 in Dayton. This road's original configuration was Zachary Lane from County 81 (then marked old State Highway 152 / MN 152) to 109th Avenue, then 109th Avenue to old U.S. 52 (later U.S. 169 until the late 1970s). At one time, this configuration was signed as County 202. In the 1990s, the road was reconfigured to Zachary Lane from County 81 to Goose Lake Road, then Goose Lake Road to Hayden Lake Road, then Hayden Lake Road to present day U.S. 169. It was reconfigured to its current route in the mid-2000s. In some spots it is marked with a \\"county road shield\\" instead of its regular \\"park access road shield\\". Sign for Park Access Road 203 near Crow-Hassan Park Reserve.Park Access Road 203 begins at the junction of County 19 and County 117 in Hanover and runs along the east side of the Crow-Hassan Park Reserve to Territorial Road (County 116) in Rogers. County Road 204 follows Bloomington Road and Minnehaha Avenue from State Highway 55 (MN 55) into the Fort Snelling Golf Course. Bloomington Road beyond Minnehaha Avenue is County Road 205 (non-CSAH).

Biography Avraham Ofek at Kibbutz Ein Hamifratz, 1952 Avraham Ofek was born in Burgas, Bulgaria. Within two years of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, 45000 of Bulgaria‚Äôs 50000 Jews left voluntarily for Israel, including fourteen-year-old Avraham Ofek. Ofek‚Äôs birth parents died prior to this, and he emigrated with an adoptive family. Ofek's adoptive status remained unknown to him until his twenties. They settled in Kibbutz Ein HaMifratz. Informally, Ofek studied painting under his neighbour, Aryeh Rothman. In 1952, Ofek's adoptive father passed away. Two years later, Ofek enlisted in the Nahal Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces.◊¢◊§◊®◊™, ◊í◊ì◊¢◊ï◊ü, ◊ë◊ô◊™, ◊ê◊ë◊®◊î◊ù ◊ê◊ï◊§◊ß, ◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊ï◊™ 1956-1986 , ◊°◊§◊®◊ô◊™ ◊§◊ï◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ù, ◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë, 1987, ◊¢◊û' 14-21 In 1958 he went to Italy to continue his studies and to participate in the mural on a wall of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. Under the spell of the art of mural painting, which Ofek considered the primary medium of his work, he painted several of his best-known works, such as the mural on the wall of Beit Haam in Kfar Uria (1970), the mural in the Central Post Office in Jerusalem (1972) and the mural 'Israel, a Shattered Dream', at Haifa University (1986-1987). Upon returning to Israel in 1962, Efrat, his eldest daughter, was born in Kibbutz Ein Hamifratz. The family shortly moved to Jerusalem, and in 1966 began teaching at the Bezalel Academy. In 1963, Ofek served as one of the coffin-bearers at the funeral of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, the second president of Israel. In 1977, Ofek began studying at Yeshiva Mercaz HaRav. Artistic style Avraham Ofek's early works were traditional landscapes, in a distinctly hybrid style that is particular to Middle Eastern, Jewish art. Later in his career, landscapes became undefined and receded into the background. Towards the end of Ofek's life, the landscape of Jerusalem became an important motif, reflecting loss and despair. Many of Ofek's landscapes convey a sense of alienation and solitude, as well as nostalgia for the city of his birth, Sofia. In 1957 his first solo exhibition was held at the Acre Museum. Following the exhibition, Ofek was invited to exhibit in the prestigious exhibition hall of the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. Most of his works in these year and until the early 1960s are made of gouache and tempera on paper. Iconographically, the paintings are characterised by the use of concrete images such as cows, agricultural machinery and landscapes of the country, painted using dark coloration that differs from earlier attempts to reflect the \\"light of the Land of Israel\\". Ofek's works included images of Arab workers and slums, which he painted during his visits to Haifa, Acre and Jaffa.◊¢◊§◊®◊™, ◊í◊ì◊¢◊ï◊ü, \\"◊î◊ì◊ô◊ê◊ú◊ß◊ò◊ô◊ß◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ú ◊©◊†◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ó◊û◊ô◊©◊ô◊ù: ◊î◊í◊û◊ï◊†◊ô◊î ◊ï◊®◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ô\\", ◊ë◊™◊ï◊ö: ◊ë◊® ◊ê◊ï◊®, ◊í◊ú◊ô◊î; ◊¢◊§◊®◊™, ◊í◊ì◊¢◊ï◊ü,◊î◊¢◊©◊ï◊® ◊î◊®◊ê◊©◊ï◊ü: ◊î◊í◊û◊ï◊†◊ô◊î ◊ï◊®◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ô , ◊û◊©◊õ◊ü ◊ú◊ê◊û◊†◊ï◊™ ◊¢◊ô◊ü ◊ó◊®◊ï◊ì, 2008 During the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s he was an active member of the Leviathan Group, with the artists Shmuel Ackerman and Mikhail Grobman. The group, which was founded in 1976, combined symbolism, metaphysics, Judaism and conceptual and environmental art. Within the framework of this group Ofek created performances and symbolic activities into which Jewish traditional symbolism was integrated. From the 1980s onward, Ofek returned to more traditional painting, which continued to feature Jewish themes, Israeli landscapes, and views of his city, Jerusalem. In 1989, the Jerusalem Print Workshop issued a collection of reproductions of his prints edited by Uri Katz, with text in Hebrew and English.

Munargo operated for the line in the New York- Bahamas-Cuba-Miami service passenger cargo trade. In June 1930 the United States and Mexican soccer teams took passage aboard Munargo from New York to Uruguay for the 1930 FIFA World Cup. The ship was acquired by the War Shipping Administration and immediately purchased by the War Department for service as a troop carrier during World War II. Shortly after acquisition the War Department transferred the ship to the U.S. Navy which commissioned the ship USS Munargo (AP-20). She operated in the Atlantic Ocean for the Navy until returned to the War Department in 1943 for conversion into the Hospital ship USAHS Thistle.  Construction and prewar service (1921‚Äì1941) Munargo keel laying was 30 September 1920 with launched on 17 September 1921 and delivery 31 December 1921 by New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey to the Munson Steamship Lines. The ship's specifications were a length of , beam of and draft of and tonnage of . The ship arrived in New York from the yards with Frank C. Munson, president of the line, and notable guests that included the Consul Generals of Cuba and Great Britain at New York in time for a New Year's Eve party aboard. Munagro was set for her first commercial voyage on 7 January 1922 with accommodations for 297 passengers with all outside staterooms, an open verandah lounge and an 11,000 mile cruising range with plans to alternate the New York-Bahamas-Cuba-Miami service with the line's other ship . On 17 November 1933 Munargo had completed discharge of passengers and some cargo at Pier 64 North River, New York, was proceeding to discharge remaining cargo in Erie Basin using the main channel south to Governor's Island and inbound from Hamburg collided while passing at 5:42 p. m. Green Flashing buoy 31. Deutschland struck Munargo slightly forward of midship on the port side penetrating about in the bottom plates and about at the upper deck. Munargo had changed course, crossing Deutschland and was found solely at fault, sustained on appeal. Munson went bankrupt in 1938 with the ship transferring to the Munargo Steamship Company operating from 1928 through 1940 between New York, Nassau, Miami and Havana. In June 1930 the ship took the Mexican and United States teams to the 1930 FIFA World Cup in Uruguay in an eighteen-day voyage from New York with stops at Rio de Janeiro and Santos, Brazil.  Government service (1941‚Äì1946) On 27 March 1941 Munargo, by then managed by the United Fruit Company, was delivered by the Munargo Steamship Company to the War Shipping Administration for War Department purchase at Pier #4, Army Base Brooklyn which was the core of the reconstituted New York Port of Embarkation. War Department plans to establish bases in Greenland, known by the code name \\"Bluie\\" were at risk when Navy notified Army that ships could not be spared ships for a required two month layover. The recently acquired Munargo being transferred to Navy for that purpose was the solution.  Navy service (1941‚Äì1943) The Army transferred Munargo to the Navy on 6 June 1941 which commissioned her as USS Munargo on 4 June 1941 with Comdr. Harold F. Ely in command. The Army's Greenland force had been scheduled to depart 19 May 1941 but repairs were required for Munargo delayed departure until 19 June when Munargo and with 469 officers and men of the force departed New York bound for Argentia, Newfoundland where they would refuel and await news of ice conditions. The ships departed Argentia 30 June and arrived off Narsarssuak, Greenland to establish Bluie West One as the major Army and Navy base in Greenland. Following conversion at Brooklyn, New York, Munargo was attached to the Naval Transportation Service at Brooklyn in December 1941. On 16 December she embarked troops and sailed to Bermuda, arriving St. George‚Äôs Harbor 2 days later. She departed 19 December for San Juan, Puerto Rico, with troops and civilian passengers, and thence steamed to Trinidad to take aboard suspected German agents for transportation to New York, arriving 5 January 1942. For the first 3-1‚ÅÑ2 months of 1942, Munargo carried troops between New York and Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. On 17 April she embarked British troops on Iceland, then carried them to Gourock, Scotland. On 31 May the ship was one of three, the other being Thomas H. Barry and Siboney departing New York engaged in experimental \\"double bunking\\" in which many troops shared a bunk and got two meals a day with mess facilities operating nearly 24 hours a day in order to maximize troop build up in Britain. After another voyage involving British troops, she returned to Boston, Massachusetts, 27 June to disembark British officers, then spent 4 months In New York. Munargo left New York 30 December with troops, cargo, and U.S. currency for Trinidad and Brazil, from which she sailed through the Panama Canal to San Francisco, California, arriving 18 March 1943. On 17 May she reached Noumea, New Caledonia with troops, returning to California to reload, and once again arriving in Noumea 18 July. She sailed almost at once for Samoa, Hawaii, Guant√°namo Bay, and the U.S. East Coast Munargo decommissioned at Brooklyn 18 October 1943, and was returned to the War Department.  Army service (1943‚Äì1946) Hospital ship= USAHS Thistle. The Army had been hesitant to withdraw troop carrying capacity for conversion into designated, Convention protected hospital ships but in June 1943, under pressure of and experience with the North African campaign the Surgeon General and Joint Chiefs of Staff decided protected hospital ships would be the normal means of evacuation for \\"helpless patients\\" from forward area hospitals. These ships would not be \\"floating hospitals\\" for initial treatment as were the Navy hospital ships but transports to clear forward area Army hospitals to rear areas or the United States and that smaller, slower troop ships would be selected and converted as soon as replacement through new construction was available. Under supervision of the Maintenance and Repair Branch of the Water Division at the New York Port of Embarkation converted Munargo to a hospital ship with the new name Thistle with a patient capacity of 455 making her first voyage to North Africa on 8 April 1944. Operating from Charleston, South Carolina, she made nine voyages of mercy to the Mediterranean. One arrival in New York harbor occurred 2 July 1945.Associated Press, \\"Two Hospital Ships Arrive in New York\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 3 July 1945, Volume 51, page 2. Ordered to the Pacific Ocean in September 1945, she called at Leyte and returned to the west coast in December. She was decommissioned as a hospital ship in March 1946. =Army transport= Immediate postwar pressure was brought to transport war brides, including infants, and military dependents whose transportation had been suspended for the duration of the war. The available ships were still in wartime condition and largely unsuitable for civilian, particularly children, passengers. Pressure to transport dependents reached Congressional level and in response, though Congress withdrew a resolution forcing Army to comply, about 30 vessels, the majority Army troop or hospital ships were designated for partial conversion to more suitable transports, including provision of \\"Cribs, high chairs, play pens, and baby baths\\" and special laundry facilities.

Thistle was redesignated as a United States Army Transport, repainted from Convention hospital ship white and as USAT Thistle engaged in relocating Army dependents and personnel until lay up in 1948. The ship was active in this role when on 17 January 1948 USAT Thistle was reported in Pacific Stars and Stripes as having arrived that morning in Yokohama with \\"220 dependents, 38 enlisted men, three officers, 11 school teachers and ten DACs\\" (Department of Army Civilians) after a seventeen-day voyage from Seattle. She transported Army Air Force men and dependents to be stationed in Alaska. One of the last trips the Thistle took was from Seattle, Washington USA to Yokohama, Japan.  Lay up and scrapping  Thistle was declared surplus by the Army, returned to the Maritime Commission and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Astoria, Oregon 1 November 1948. On 19 February 1957 the vessel was sold to the Learner Company for $216,000 and delivered for scrapping 13 March 1957.

The son of a Scottish-Australian merchant and politician, he was born in England and moved to Sydney when he was one year old, returning to Britain at the age of eleven for education at Bristol and Cambridge. In 1900 he went back to Australia and enlisted in the Militia, before acquiring cattle stations in New South Wales and Queensland. He was also a partner in the family shipping firm. The first Australian to qualify for a Royal Aero Club flying certificate, in 1911, Watt joined the French Foreign Legion as a pilot on the outbreak of World War I. He transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in 1916, quickly progressing from flight commander with No. 1 Squadron in Egypt to commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron on the Western Front. By February 1918, he had been promoted to lieutenant colonel and taken command of the AFC's 1st Training Wing in England. A recipient of France's Legion of Honour and Croix de Guerre, and twice mentioned in despatches during the war, Watt was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. He left the military to pursue business interests in Australia, and was lauded for his generosity to other returned airmen. In 1921, at the age of forty- three, he died by accidental drowning at Bilgola Beach, New South Wales. He is commemorated by the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for outstanding achievement in Australian aviation, and the Oswald Watt Fund at the University of Sydney. Early career Born on 11 February 1878 in Bournemouth, England, Oswald Watt was the youngest son of John Brown Watt, a Scot who had migrated to New South Wales in 1842 and became a successful merchant and politician, frequently representing his state on overseas missions. Oswald's Australian-born mother, Mary Jane, died when he was one and shortly afterwards the family relocated to Sydney. Oswald was sent back to England at the age of eleven to complete his schooling at Clifton College, Bristol, before going on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899. Returning to Sydney in 1900, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the New South Wales Scottish Rifles, a Militia unit, and in 1902 was appointed an aide-de-camp to the Governor of New South Wales. On 27 September that year, he married Muriel Williams at St. John's Anglican Church in Toorak, Victoria; the couple had one son. Retrieved 10 November 2013. alt=Single-engined monoplane on airfield in front of hangar with Union Jack on flagpole Watt's family was wealthy, and he was able to establish himself as a grazier by purchasing several cattle stations in New South Wales and Queensland. Travelling abroad again, he obtained his Master of Arts degree from Cambridge in 1904.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 16‚Äì19 In October the following year he was promoted to captain in the Scottish Rifles. On a subsequent trip to England he took flying lessons at the Bristol aviation school on Salisbury Plain, where his fellow students included Eric Harrison. Watt attained his Royal Aero Club certificate, no. 112, on 1 August 1911, becoming the first Australian citizen so qualified.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, p. 16 Upon his return to Australia later that year, he publicly declared that the time was \\"rapidly approaching when an aero corps [would] have to be inaugurated\\" as part of the country's \\"military defence scheme\\". In March 1912, Watt recommended a location in Canberra near the Royal Military College, Duntroon, as a base for the Army's proposed Central Flying School. Owing to its altitude and nearby mountainous terrain, the site was rejected by the school's nominated commanding officer, Lieutenant Henry Petre.Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, p. 1 Petre eventually chose 297 hectares at Point Cook, Victoria, an area suitable for seaplanes as well as land-based aircraft, to become the \\"birthplace of Australian military aviation\\".Odgers, Air Force Australia, pp. 13‚Äì14Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 3 Watt also advocated manufacturing foreign-designed aircraft under licence in Australia, but this would not be pursued until after World War I.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 248, 500 In 1913 he was divorced on the grounds of \\"misconduct\\" with actress Ivy Schilling, and lost custody of his son in the judgment. He then went to Egypt, where he purchased and practised flying a Bl√©riot XI monoplane; while there he met leading French aviators Louis Bl√©riot and Roland Garros. World War I alt=Overhead view of single-engined military biplane with twin-tail boom in flight In May 1914, the francophile Watt left Egypt with his aeroplane and took up employment at the Bl√©riot factory and airfield in Buc, outside Paris. Fired by the widely held conviction that Britain would stay out of a European conflict, Watt offered his services and his plane to the French government on 2 August, the day France declared war on Germany. This gesture was welcomed and he joined the Aviation Militaire section of the Foreign Legion as a pilot. Though he was ranked an ordinary soldier, his colleagues in Bleriot Squadron No. 30 referred to him as \\"Capitaine\\" in deference to his previous status in the Australian Militia. Posted to Maurice Farman Squadron No. 44 in April 1915, he earned the Legion of Honour badge after he and his observer crash- landed in no man's land and succeeded in making their way back to French lines with valuable intelligence under intense fire from German positions. Soon afterwards, Watt was awarded the Croix de Guerre‚Äîwith palm leaves personally presented by General Joffre‚Äîand promoted to the provisional rank of captain. As a foreigner, however, he was not eligible to command a French unit.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 41‚Äì42 Watt always proclaimed his antipodean connection while serving France, painting a kangaroo on the nose of his plane, which he named Advance Australia. Considered a no-nonsense type, he once introduced himself to a British pilot with the words \\"I am an Australian and I haven't got any manners\\".Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 61 alt=Half portrait of man in military uniform with kepi, outdoors The French recognised that Watt's talents were not being fully utilised due to his ineligibility to lead a squadron, and recommended that he transfer to the Australian Flying Corps. Watt did so on 1 March 1916, with the rank of captain. Posted to Egypt in May, he was made commander of B Flight, No. 1 Squadron, and took charge of the unit's first contingent of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s the following month.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 33‚Äì36 No. 1 Squadron was engaged mainly in aerial reconnaissance and army co-operation duties, but the two-seat B.E.2 proved inferior to German Fokkers and Rumplers in speed, time- to-climb, and manoeuvrability.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 10‚Äì11 In September 1916, Watt was promoted to major and given command of No. 2 Squadron, which was formed in Kantara. He was mentioned in despatches by General Archibald Murray, Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, on 13 October; the commendation was promulgated in the London Gazette on 1 December. No. 2 Squadron's personnel was composed largely of former Lighthorsemen, as well as thirteen mechanics from the Australian Flying Corps' first combat formation, the Mesopotamian Half Flight, led by Flight Sergeant George Mackinolty. Watt personally trained the force in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying it to the Western Front that September. He was \\"a born leader of men\\", according to one officer, while another recalled that \\"In the things that mattered, his men knew he stood for absolute obedience. They also knew that when discipline could be safely relaxed he would be quick to grant them some relief from the strain.\\"Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 205 alt=Formal portrait of seven men in military uniforms with peaked caps, four seated and holding canes, and three standing behind them In the vicinity of Saint-Quentin on 2 October, No. 2 Squadron became the first AFC unit in Europe to see aerial combat when one of its patrols engaged some German two-seaters, which managed to escape.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 178‚Äì180 Because the Airco DH.5s in the squadron were handicapped as fighters by engine problems and low speed, the squadron was employed mainly in ground support duties. During the Battle of Cambrai that commenced on 20 November 1917, Watt led his pilots on daring low-level bombing and strafing attacks against enemy fortifications and lines of communication. Their loss rate reached 30%, but morale remained high.Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, p. 25 After visiting the squadron, the Royal Flying Corps' Major General Hugh Trenchard described its airmen as \\"really magnificent\\" while Charles Bean, war correspondent and future editor of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918, commented on their \\"remarkably high level of conduct and general tone\\". Six of Watt's officers were awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the battle, prompting General Sir William Birdwood to send him a personal message of congratulation on 16 December, declaring: \\"... This is indeed a magnificent record for your squadron, and one of which I am sure everyone of you must rightly be extremely proud; I doubt if it has been beaten anywhere ...\\" By this time, No. 2 Squadron had begun converting to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, though it could achieve little in the winter months due to inclement weather. Watt himself, now almost forty, was beginning to show the strain of frontline command. Bean found him looking \\"very worn\\" and noticed him shivering even while seated in front of the mess hall fire.Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 231 In February 1918, Watt was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the AFC's 1st Training Wing (Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 Squadrons) headquartered at Tetbury in Gloucestershire, England; the wing's role was to train replacement pilots for the four operational AFC squadrons in Palestine and France.Garrisson, Australian Fighter Aces, p. 12 Watt proposed moving the wing to France, but it remained in England. He was mentioned in despatches by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on 7 April, and the commendation was gazetted on 28 May. Shortly after the end of hostilities in November 1918, novelist William John Locke visited 1st Training Wing and found that \\"there was not one [of Watt's men] who ... did not confide to me his pride in serving under a leader so distinguished\\". A pilot later opined that as well as having \\"courage, determination, and an immense capacity for work\\", Watt possessed \\"the greatest factor in leadership, a genius for endearing himself (without conscious effort) to all who served under him\\". Post-war career and legacy General Sir William Birdwood (fifth from left) with (left to right behind Birdwood) Major alt=A group of military personnel in an aircraft hangar, four of whom are in a row facing another man, while the remainder stand informally, one of them wearing a flying suit Watt was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1919, in recognition of his war service. He returned to Australia on 6 May with the rest of 1st Training Wing's personnel, aboard the troopship Kaisar-i-Hind, on which he was the ranking officer. Leaving the AFC soon afterwards, he was elected president of the New South Wales section of the Australian Aero Club. He also served as senior delegate on a committee of veteran military pilots examining applications for appointment to a proposed independent Australian air service.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 20 Watt was esteemed as a man who did not forget old comrades, providing former AFC members with financial aid and helping them re- establish themselves in civilian life. He maintained an interest in commercial flying but refused an offer to take up the position of controller of civil aviation in 1920 owing to his business interests, which included partnership in the family shipping firm of Gilchrist, Watt & Sanderson Ltd, and directorships of mining, rubber, and art corporations. He also turned down invitations to stand for parliament, and to join the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force.Sutherland, Command and Leadership in War and Peace, pp. 4, 34‚Äì36 Oswald Watt drowned at Bilgola Beach, near Newport, New South Wales, on 21 May 1921. Cuts and bruising on his body indicated that he had slipped on rocks, struck his head, and rolled unconscious into relatively shallow water. Survived by his 15-year-old son, he was accorded a military funeral two days later at St Jude's Church, Randwick. Members of the AFC, Royal Air Force, and Australian Aero Club formed a guard of honour at the service, one of the largest in the suburb's history, which also included representatives of the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army. Among the tributes was a floral wreath from an anonymous group of French admirers, and another that was dropped by parachute from a low-flying plane. On 31 May, Watt's body was cremated and his ashes interred in the family vault at St Jude's. In his will, Watt left two bequests to the Australian Aero Club, one of which was used to establish the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for outstanding achievement in Australian aviation. Winners of the award have included Charles Kingsford Smith, Bert Hinkler, Henry Millicer, Ivor McIntyre, Jon Johanson and Andy Thomas. He also bequeathed a sum to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, to award annually a set of binoculars for the best cadet essay on military aviation or aeronautics. The award was founded as the Oswald Watt Prize later in 1921.Air Power Development Centre, \\"Oswald Watt: The Leader the RAAF Never Had\\" Most of the residue of Watt's estate went to the University of Sydney. Considered one of the university's great benefactors, he was commemorated by the Oswald Watt Fund. In May 1923, the Oswald Watt Wing of the Havilah Home for Orphans, Wahroonga, was opened by the Governor-General of Australia. Watt was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M. Cutlack in the latter's volume on the Australian Flying Corps that was first published in 1923 as part of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. iii‚Äìvii During World War I, Oswald Watt had been the only AFC officer to command a wing apart from Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, who was later to become known as the \\"Father of the RAAF\\". In 2001, military historian Alan Stephens noted that \\"had fate drawn him to a post-war career in the Air Force instead of to business and an untimely death, 'Toby' Watt might have challenged Richard Williams as the RAAF's dominant figure in its formative years\\".

It has been identified as an outflow channel.Carr, M.H. (2006), The Surface of Mars. Cambridge Planetary Science Series, Cambridge University Press. It merges with Dao Vallis which runs southwestward into Hellas Planitia from the volcanic Hadriacus Mons. Like Dao, it was formed around the Late Noachian and Early Hesperian Epochs. It is named after the Niger River in Africa.  Ice- rich mantle  Much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust.Head, J. et al. 2003. Recent ice ages on Mars. Nature:426. 797-802. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An image below shows a good view of this smooth mantle around Niger Vallis, as observed with HiRISE. Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor will condense on the particles, then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulates the remaining ice.MLA NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2003, December 18).

KCOH returned to the legendary music format on March 14, 2019, while KCOH officially relaunched on Monday April 15, 2019 as \\"1230 KCOH, The Source\\", featuring many of the long-time KCOH shows from the original station, and the return of such legendary KCOH personalities as Don Sam and Ralph Cooper. History=K-NUZ \\"Dial It Up\\" 1-2-3 The radio station began in 1948 when KTHT (now KBME) vacated this frequency for a stronger signal at 790 kHz. Under the KNUZ callsign, it was a Top40 formatted station through the 1960s, competing with KILT (AM) but eventually Houston outgrew 1230's signal coverage and KILT won the battle in the early 70s. KNUZ then switched to a country format until the late 1980s, becoming a News/Opinion format until owner Dave Morris sold the station along with its sister FM, KQUE on 102.9, to Clear Channel in 1997. K-NUZ Becomes \\"KQ 1230\\" During a period after the FM/AM pair were sold, 1230 (now KQUE) was used to continue the MOR standards format previously on their 102.9 counterpart during the ownership days of SFX Broadcasting Corporation which took over ABC Radio affiliate KNUZ \\"K-News\\" News/Opinion. This resulted in 1230 abandoning the KNUZ calls it had used since its inception, and took the calls out of the city that had long been associated with them. The KNUZ callsign had also been used on Channel 39 (Channel 39 frequency now occupied by KIAH). The KNUZ callsign was quickly requested and assigned to AM 1090 in Bellville, Texas. After 41 Years, \\"KQ\\" Goes Dark After the longtime Standards and Big Band format was folded in May 2001, KQUE became part of a quadcast with Rhythmic oldies-formatted KTJM until July 2001, along with 880 AM, and 103.3 FM. KQUE then dropped the quadcast and began a simulcast of classic rock-formatted KKRW (now KQBT). Liberman Purchases KQUE; KCOH Moves to 1230 LBI acquired KQUE in June 2002. Under Liberman's control, the station began as a simulcast partner of KTJM, as \\"La Raza\\", with a Regional Mexican format. It then continued as a Regional Mexican station under its own identity, and simulcast with 880 KJOJ, as \\"Radio Ranchito\\". It has also been the home of brokered programming, while owned by Liberman, as it was the home of Desi language \\"Hum Tum Radio\\" for a short period. On March 1, 2013, KQUE would return to English-language broadcasting as it became the new home for the Urban Oldies format, continued from its long history at 1430 kHz under a LMA from Liberman Broadcasting to the Jesse Dunn organization, which provided the programming for 1230's entire broadcast day. As a part of the lease agreement between Liberman and the Dunn organization, the KQUE call would be retired, as the legendary KCOH calls were moved in tandem with the format from 1430 AM to this facility. KQUE's call set has since reappeared on the dial in the Houston area, where it is now located at 980 AM in Rosenberg, a sister station to 1230. The station simulcasted the Regional Mexican format of then sister station 850 KEYH as \\"La Ranchera\\" prior to the sale of the facility to Pueblo de Galilea, LLC. Sale to Pueblo de Galilea, LLC Liberman Broadcasting filed an application to sell KCOH to Pueblo de Galilea, LLC in April 2016. It was granted by the Federal Communications Commission and consummated on May 2, 2016, resulting in KCOH becoming a member of Radio Aleluya, a local Spanish-language Christian radio network owned by Pueblo de Galilea. The purchase price for the facility was $1.8 million. On Friday October 15, 2016 Pueblo de Galilea completed the move of translator K223CW from George West, Texas to a tower located in north Houston. KCOH immediately dropped the simulcast with sister station 1590 KMIC Houston, and launched a new Tropical format on KCOH and the new translator named \\"La Calle 92.5\\". ESPN Deportes Radio Moves to KCOH In September 2017, ESPN Deportes Radio moved from 1180 KGOL to KCOH. With the change, KCOH also lost its FM translator 92.5 K223CW, which was moved to sister Radio Aleluya facility 880 KJOZ Conroe, while the two facilities continued the Tropical \\"La Calle\\" format that KCOH had abandoned for sports programming. The Return of the Legendary KCOH On March 14, 2019, 1230 KCOH dropped \\"ESPN Deportes Radio\\" and returned to the heritage Urban format long associated with the KCOH call set. At the time of the reboot it was running with no commercial interruptions. KCOH officially relaunched as \\"1230 The Source\\" on April 15, 2019, bringing back many of the familiar shows and voices from the station's illustrious past.

In 2010, when Republicans took control of the state Senate, Brown was selected by the caucus to become Senate majority leader. As the chamber's chief budget-writer, Brown and state House Speaker Tim Moore, a fellow Republican, were the two North Carolina lawmakers with the most earmarked funding for their districts in the 2015 state budget, securing a collective total of $19 million.Colin Campbell, \\"NC House speaker, Senate budget writer send money home\\", Charlotte Observer, 25 October 2015, accessed 17 May 2016 Brown defended his use of earmarks for projects in his district, which included $10.96 million for a new middle and high school in Jones County, $2 million for construction of an air traffic control tower at the Albert J. Ellis Airport, and $500,000 for the Museum of the Marine. In 2017 Brown, in an attempt to increase funding in rural communities, proposed legislation to modify the distribution of state spending from sales tax revenue by allocating more of the money to the areas where the customers lived instead of where the businesses they shopped at were located. Urban areas with large shopping centers opposed the move, and the change was not implemented.

Sinclair organized ten printings of The Brass Check in its first decade and sold over 150,000 copies. Overview The book is one of the \\"Dead Hand\\" series: six books Sinclair wrote on American institutions. The series also includes The Profits of Religion, The Goose-step (higher education), The Goslings (elementary and high school education), Mammonart (great literature, art and music) and Money Writes! (literature). The term \\"Dead Hand\\" criticizes Adam Smith‚Äôs concept that allowing an \\"invisible hand\\" of capitalist greed to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole. A brass check was the token purchased by a customer in a brothel and given to the woman of his choice. Sinclair implies that, in a similar fashion, the owners of the mass media purchase journalists' services in supporting the owners' political and financial interests. Detailed synopsis The Brass Check has three sections: documented cases of newspapers' refusal to publicize Socialist causes and Sinclair's investigations of business corruption, cases where he was not personally involved, and proposed remedies. Sinclair incorporates other people's reactions to his cause into his nonfiction works, fostering objectivity. Sinclair criticizes newspapers as ultra-conservative and supporting the political and economic powers that be, or as sensational tabloids practicing yellow journalism, such as newspapers run by William Randolph Hearst. In both cases, their purpose is to promote the business interests of the paper's owners, the owner's bankers, and/or the paper's advertisers. This is accomplished in several ways; among them: The publishers tell the editors what can and cannot be printed. Journalists routinely invent stories. To stimulate circulation, newspapers sensationalize trivial stories and destroy lives and reputations. Errors and slanders are never retracted, or the retraction is buried in the paper months later. The editors and journalists of the Associated Press (AP) wire service fail to serve the public interest in the same way as employees of the individual papers. Controlled by 41 large newspaper corporations, the AP acts in their interests.Nalbach, Alex. \\"\\"Poisoned at the Source\\"? Telegraphic News Services and Big Business in the Nineteenth Century.\\" Business History Review, 77:4 (Winter 2003), 577-611. (Available through JSTOR) Corroborates Sinclair's claim that the corporate control of the AP shaped the news it reported. Sinclair quotes a letter from the editor of the weekly San Francisco Star, James H. Barry: > You wish to know my \\"confidential opinion as to the honesty of the > Associated Press.\\" My opinion, not confidential, is that it is the damndest, > meanest monopoly on the face of the earth--the wet-nurse for all other > monopolies. It lies by day, it lies by night, and it lies for the very lust > of lying. Its news-gatherers, I sincerely believe, only obey orders. Among the recent events whose media coverage he discusses are the Paint Creek- Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in West Virginia, the Ludlow massacre in Colorado in 1914, Industrial Workers of the World meetings, and the Red Scare whipped up by the newspapers. As a tireless investigative reporter, Sinclair offered the results of his investigations to the newspapers for publication, but was almost entirely ignored. The propaganda tactics practiced by U.S. government and corporations during World War I were continued after the war against political dissenters. Sinclair writes, \\"[T]oday all the energies which were directed against the Kaiser have been turned against the radicals.\\"The Brass Check, Chapter LIX, p. 381. Remedies proposed Sinclair recognized that a grass-roots response (mass meetings, demonstrations, circulating pamphlets, etc.) was not adequate when the mass media spread misinformation or ignored the truth. His main proposed remedies were: * a law that any newspaper which prints a false statement shall be required to give equal prominence to a correction, on penalty of a substantial fine. * the AP's monopoly, which he saw as a \\"public utility\\", should be challenged by other wire services. * a law forbidding any newspaper to fake telegraph or cable dispatches. * reporters must unionize so they have the power to fix their wage-scale and their ethical code. * an endowed weekly chronicle of news, without advertisements or editorials, cheaply printed and widely available.

Excerpted from Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937-1942. Sinclair challenged those who charged him with inaccuracy to review his published facts and to sue him for libel if they found he had been wrong. None did. But because Sinclair was denied access to the mainstream media to refute those charges, they assumed the aura of truth and gave the book a reputation for inaccuracy that caused it to be almost forgotten by midcentury.

Polymer engineering covers aspects of the petrochemical industry, polymerization, structure and characterization of polymers, properties of polymers, compounding and processing of polymers and description of major polymers, structure property relations and applications.  History  The word ‚Äúpolymer‚Äù was introduced by the Swedish chemist J. J. Berzelius. He considered, for example, benzene (C6H6) to be a polymer of ethyne (C2H2). Later this definition underwent a subtle modification. The history of human use of polymers has been long since the mid-19th century, when it entered the chemical modification of natural polymers, 1839 C. Goodyear has found a critical advance in the research of rubber vulcanization, which has turned natural rubber into a practical engineering material. In 1870, J. W. Hyatt uses camphor to plasticize nitrocellulose to make nitrocellulose plastics industrial. 1907 L. Baekeland reported the synthesis of the first thermosetting phenolic resin, which was industrialized in the 1920s, the first synthetic plastic product. In 1920, H. Standinger proposed that polymers are long-chain molecules that are connected by structural units through common covalent bonds. This conclusion laid the foundation for the establishment of modern polymer science. Subsequently, Carothers divided the synthetic polymers into two broad categories, namely a polycondensate obtained by a polycondensation reaction and an addition polymer obtained by a polyaddition reaction. 1950s K. Ziegler and G. Natta discovered a coordination polymerization catalyst and pioneered the era of synthesis of stereoregular polymers. In the decades after the establishment of the concept of macromolecules, the synthesis of high polymers has achieved rapid development, and many important polymers have been industrialized one after another. Classification The basic division of polymers into thermoplastics, elastomers and thermosets helps define their areas of application.  Thermoplastics  Thermoplastic refers to a plastic that has heat softening and cooling hardening properties. Most of the plastics we use in our daily lives fall into this category. It becomes soft and even flows when heated, and the cooling becomes hard. This process is reversible and can be repeated. Thermoplastics have relatively low tensile moduli, but also have lower densities and properties such as transparency which make them ideal for consumer products and medical products. They include polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, acetal resin, polycarbonate and PET, all of which are widely used materials.  Elastomers  An elastomer generally refers to a material that can be restored to its original state after removal of an external force, whereas a material having elasticity is not necessarily an elastomer. The elastomer is only deformed under weak stress, and the stress can be quickly restored to a polymer material close to the original state and size. Elastomers are polymers which have very low moduli and show reversible extension when strained, a valuable property for vibration absorption and damping. They may either be thermoplastic (in which case they are known as Thermoplastic elastomers) or crosslinked, as in most conventional rubber products such as tyres. Typical rubbers used conventionally include natural rubber, nitrile rubber, polychloroprene, polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene and fluorinated rubbers.  Thermosets  A thermosetting resin is used as a main component, and a plastic which forms a product is formed by a cross- linking curing process in combination with various necessary additives. It is liquid in the early stage of the manufacturing or molding process, and it is insoluble and infusible after curing, and it cannot be melted or softened again. Common thermosetting plastics are phenolic plastics, epoxy plastics, aminoplasts, unsaturated polyesters, alkyd plastics, and the like. Thermoset plastics and thermoplastics together constitute the two major components of synthetic plastics. Thermosetting plastics are divided into two types: formaldehyde cross-linking type and other cross-linking type. Thermosets includes phenolic resins, polyesters and epoxy resins, all of which are used widely in composite materials when reinforced with stiff fibers such as fiberglass and aramids. Since crosslinking stabilises the thermoset polymer matrix of these materials, they have physical properties more similar to traditional engineering materials like steel. However, their very much lower densities compared with metals makes them ideal for lightweight structures. In addition, they suffer less from fatigue, so are ideal for safety-critical parts which are stressed regularly in service.  Materials = Plastic  Plastic is a polymer compound which is polymerized by polyaddition polymerization and polycondensation. It is free to change the composition and shape. It is made up of synthetic resins and fillers, plasticizers, stabilizers, lubricants, colorants and other additives. The main component of plastic is resin. Resin means that the polymer compound has not been added with various additives. The term resin was originally named for the secretion of oil from plants and animals, such as rosin and shellac. Resin accounts for approximately 40% - 100% of the total weight of the plastic. The basic properties of plastics are mainly determined by the nature of the resin, but additives also play an important role. Some plastics are basically made of synthetic resins, with or without additives such as plexiglass, polystyrene, etc.  Fiber  Fiber refers to a continuous or discontinuous filament of one substance. Animals and plant fibers play an important role in maintaining tissue. Fibers are widely used and can be woven into good threads, thread ends and hemp ropes. They can also be woven into fibrous layers when making paper or feel. They are also commonly used to make other materials together with other materials to form composites. Therefore, whether it is natural or synthetic fiber filamentous material. In modern life, the application of fiber is ubiquitous, and there are many high-tech products.  Rubber  Rubber refers to highly elastic polymer materials and reversible shapes. It is elastic at room temperature and can be deformed with a small external force. After removing the external force, it can return to the original state. Rubber is a completely amorphous polymer with a low glass transition temperature and a large molecular weight, often greater than several hundred thousand. Highly elastic polymer compounds can be classified into natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Natural rubber processing extracts gum rubber and grass rubber from plants; synthetic rubber is polymerized by various monomers. Rubber can be used as elastic, insulating, water-impermeable air-resistant materials.  Applications  B-2 Spirit stealth bomber of the U.S. Air Force.  Polyethylene  Commonly used polyethylenes can be classified into low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). Among them, HDPE has better thermal, electrical and mechanical properties, while LDPE and LLDPE have better flexibility, impact properties and film forming properties. LDPE and LLDPE are mainly used for plastic bags, plastic wraps, bottles, pipes and containers; HDPE is widely used in various fields such as film, pipelines and daily necessities because its resistance to many different solvents.  Polypropylene  Polypropylene is widely used in various applications due to its good chemical resistance and weldability. It has lowest density among commodity plastics. It is commonly used in packaging applications, consumer goods, automatic applications and medical applications. Polypropylene sheets are widely used in industrial sector to produce acid and chemical tanks, sheets, pipes, Returnable Transport Packaging (RTP), etc. because of its properties like high tensile strength, resistance to high temperatures and corrosion resistance.  Composites  A time-trial carbon fibre composite bicycle with aerodynamic wheels and aero barsTypical uses of composites are monocoque structures for aerospace and automobiles, as well as more mundane products like fishing rods and bicycles. The stealth bomber was the first all-composite aircraft, but many passenger aircraft like the Airbus and the Boeing 787 use an increasing proportion of composites in their fuselages, such as hydrophobic melamine foam.http://www.polytechinc.com/news/08232013-recognized-by-theboeingcompany The quite different physical properties of composites gives designers much greater freedom in shaping parts, which is why composite products often look different from conventional products. On the other hand, some products such as drive shafts, helicopter rotor blades, and propellers look identical to metal precursors owing to the basic functional needs of such components.  Biomedical applications  Biodegradable polymers are widely used materials for many biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. They are considered very promising for controlled drug delivery devices. Biodegradable polymers also offer great potential for wound management, orthopaedic devices, dental applications and tissue engineering. Not like non biodegradable polymers, they won't require a second step of a removal from body. Biodegradable polymers will break down and are absorbed by the body after they served their purpose. Since 1960, polymers prepared from glycolic acid and lactic acid have found a multitude of uses in the medical industry. Polylactates (PLAs) are popular for drug delivery system due to their fast and adjustable degradation rate.  Membrane technologies  Membrane techniques are successfully used in the separation in the liquid and gas systems for years, and the polymeric membranes are used most commonly because they have lower cost to produce and are easy to modify their surface, which make them suitable in different separation processes. Polymers helps in many fields including the application for separation of biological active compounds, proton exchange membranes for fuel cells and membrane contractors for carbon dioxide capture process.

Its 2008 season drivers were Petter Solberg with co-driver Phil Mills, and Chris Atkinson with co-driver St√©phane Pr√©vot. David Richards was the team's Principal, and a founder and chairman of Prodrive. Paul Howarth was the team's operations director and team manager. He replaced David Lapworth in 2006. Richard Taylor is the team's managing director. The team was historically an extremely strong one, competing in the WRC longer than any other manufacturer team in their current form. It has won the manufacturers' championship three times in 1995, 1996, and 1997, and the drivers' championship three times, in 1995, 2001, and 2003. Its Impreza model won a record 46 rallies. The team withdrew from WRC competition at the end of the 2008 season due to widespread economic downturn. Racing history Team Principal David Richards Although Subaru had participated in the World Rally Championship at various times since 1980, it was not until September 1989, that the Subaru World Rally Team, in its current form, was created. Subaru Tecnica International (STi) president Ryuichiro Kuze forged a partnership with the British firm Prodrive to prepare and enter the recently introduced Legacy RS in the World Rally Championship. 1980‚Äì1989 Subaru's initial forays into the World Rally Championship were with Subaru Rally Team Japan, run by Noriyuki Koseki, the founder of Subaru Tecnica International. The first Subaru car entered a world rally at the 1980 Safari Rally and since that, the team only participated in a few events per season, driving the Subaru Leone. Drivers in the early years included Ari Vatanen, Per Eklund, Shekhar Mehta, Mike Kirkland, Possum Bourne, and Harald Demuth. The best result and only podium was achieved by Bourne at the 1987 Rally New Zealand by finishing third. With the start of the Prodrive effort, the teams competed in parallel, before being folded into each other. 1990‚Äì1992 Subaru entered its first Prodrive developed car, the Group A Subaru Legacy RS in the 1990 season, piloted by Finnish driver Markku Al√©n. Alen remained with the team through the 1991 season. His successes included 4th place in the 1990 Rally Finland, also known as the 1000 Lakes Rally, and in 1991, a 3rd and two 4th places. For the 1992 season, Subaru only entered seven of the fourteen WRC events, preferring to demonstrate the car's ability on gravel rallies. The drivers for 1992 were Finn Ari Vatanen with co-driver Bruno Berglund and Scotsman Colin McRae with co-driver Derek Ringer. Both drivers were able to achieve second-place finishes. Colin McRae also won the British Rally Championship in 1991 and 1992. 1993 1993 Legacy RS in 555 livery For the 1993 World Rally Championship season, the Subaru team debuted its now distinctive blue and yellow color scheme, along with a new title sponsor, State Express 555. Ari Vatanen and Colin McRae remained the primary drivers, with the season being McRae's first complete year of World Rally Championship competition. Markku Al√©n, returned part-time to the team after a brief stint at Toyota in 1992, and took 4th for Subaru in Portugal. McRae took the first win for Subaru, at the eighth event of the season, Rally New Zealand, the last outing for the Group A Subaru Legacy rally cars. At the next event, Rally Finland, Subaru debuted their new Prodrive developed Group A Impreza rally car, known as the Impreza 555, driven by Vatanen and Al√©n. Al√©n crashed on the first stage, and did not drive for Subaru again. Vatanen, however, showed the car to be quick, even leading the rally at one point, and managing a second-place finish. At the end of the season, Vatanen took seventh in the Drivers‚Äô Championship, and Colin McRae finished in fifth with 50. Subaru finished third in the Manufacturers‚Äô Championship. Other drivers also competed for the Subaru team at selected events. New Zealand driver Possum Bourne, veteran of Subaru's early days, joined the team for the Rally New Zealand and Rally Australia. Piero Liatti competed in Rallye Sanremo and Rally Great Britain. Drivers Richard Burns and Alister McRae had competed in the British Championship, which Burns won, and appeared again in Legacies for Rally Great Britain, where Burns finished seventh and McRae tenth. Drivers Per Eklund and Hannu Mikkola drove for the team in Rally Sweden. 1994‚Äì1995 In 1994, former World Rally Drivers' Champion Carlos Sainz joined the team with co-driver Luis Moya, and took the Impreza 555 to its first win at the Acropolis Rally in Greece. It later took wins in New Zealand and Great Britain with McRae at the wheel. In the Championship for Manufacturers, they achieved a second-place finish, behind Toyota, with Sainz placing second in the driver's championship, and McRae placing fourth. Other drivers for the Subaru team in 1994 included Patrick Njiru, competing in the Safari Rally, Richard Burns in the Safari Rally and Rally Great Britain, Possum Bourne in New Zealand, and Piero Liatti at Rallye Sanremo. For the 1995 season, the primary drivers remained Sainz in the number 5 car and McRae in the number 4 car. Sainz won the season opening round at the Rallye Monte Carlo, while McRae crashed out of the event. At Rally Sweden, Sainz, McRae, and third driver Mats Jonsson all retired with engine trouble. Sainz won again at the Rally Portugal, while McRae finished in third place. At the Rallye de France, Sainz, McRae, and third driver Piero Liatti finished in the fourth, fifth, and sixth places respectively. At Rally New Zealand, McRae took his first win of the season. Other drivers for the team included Possum Bourne, who finished in seventh place, and Richard Burns who retired with a mechanical failure. At the Rally Australia, McRae took second place. Sainz retired after his radiator failed, while third driver Bourne retired after an accident. At the Rallye Catalunya, Subaru locked out the podium with a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 finish. Sainz took first, McRae took second, and third driver Piero Liatti finished third. Sainz's first-place finish in Catalunya left he and McRae tied for points going into the last event of the season, the RAC Rally of Great Britain. McRae won out, taking first place at his home event, clinching his first and only Driver's Championship, a first for the Subaru team. Sainz finished close behind in second place, giving him second in the Championship, and third driver Richard Burns finished in third place, giving the team a second consecutive 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 finish. Between McRae and Sainz the team managed to win five of the season's eight rallies for Subaru, winning the team its first Constructors Championship. At the end of the season, Sainz left Subaru to join Ford World Rallye Sport. 1996 Colin McRae's 1996 Impreza 555 For the 1996 World Rally Championship season, Colin McRae was again the lead driver for Subaru. Following his 1995 Championship victory, his Impreza 555 wore the #1 plate. He was joined by team drivers Kenneth Eriksson, in the #2 car, and Piero Liatti, with their co-drivers, Staffan Parmander and Mario Ferfoglia, respectively. At the first event of the season, Rally Sweden, McRae took third, Eriksson took fifth, and Liatti took twelfth. 1994 World Drivers' Champion Didier Auriol also drove for the Subaru team in Sweden, taking his #3 car to tenth place. At the second round, the Safari Rally, Liatti's number was changed from #10 to #3. He took fifth place. McRae took fourth while Eriksson took second. At the Rally Indonesia, Liatti finished in second place, while McRae and Eriksson both retired following accidents. McRae's first victory of the season was at the Acropolis Rally, the fourth round of the championship. Liatti and Erikkson placed fourth and fifth respectively. Eriksson took third and Liatti fifth at Rally Argentina. McRae crashed out of Rally Argentina and the following event, Rally Finland. Liatti didn't compete in Finland, though Eriksson managed to finish in 5th place. McRae, Eriksson, and Liatti finished 4th, 2nd, and 7th respectively at Rally Australia. In Sanremo, McRae took victory, with Eriksson finishing in 5th. Liatti retired following an electrical failure. At the last round of the season, Rallye Catalunya, McRae took a second consecutive victory. Subaru took a 1‚Äì2 finish with Liatti finishing second. Eriksson finished in seventh position. Thanks to consistent podium finishes, Subaru successfully defended its Constructors' Championship, but McRae lost the Driver's Championship to Tommi Makinen. 1997‚Äì1998 For 1997, McRae again led the team, however his co-driver Derek Ringer was replaced by Welshman Nicky Grist. Secondary driver/co-driver teams included Piero Liatti/Fabrizia Pons (first in Monte Carlo), Olivier Burri/Christophe Hofmann and Kenneth Eriksson/Staffan Parmander (first in Sweden and New Zealand). Once again the team successfully defended its Constructors Championship, winning eight victories out of the fourteen rallies, but McRae again lost the Driver's Championship to Tommi Makinen, this time by just one point. In 1998 the team had an almost unchanged line-up, although Jahu Kangas/Pentti Kuukkala and Jarno Kyt√∂lehto/Arto Kapanen participated in one round each. McRae took wins in Portugal, Corsica and Greece. However, bad weather and mechanical failures hurt the team, and Subaru and McRae finished third in their respective championships. At the end of the season, McRae left the team to join Ford, with the tantalizing prospect of driving their brand- new car, the Ford Focus WRC. 1999‚Äì2001 Petter Solberg Subaru had an all new line up for the 1999 season, with the nominated driver/co-driver teams of Richard Burns/Robert Reid, Juha Kankkunen/Juha Repo, and third team of Bruno Thiry/St√©phane Pr√©vot. The new car, the WRC99, featured an electronically controlled Paddle shifter with a drive-by-wire throttle. Due to technical difficulties, the team struggled until the season's 7th round in Argentina. From there on, the teams earned the podium in seven out of eight events, with five wins, three of which were 1‚Äì2 finishes. Subaru finished second in the Manufacturers‚Äô Championship, just four points behind Toyota. Burns scored victories in Greece, Australia, and Wales, for second place and Kankkunen took fourth in the Drivers‚Äô Championship, with wins in Argentina and Finland. Burns and Kankkunen continued to drive for Subaru for the 2000 season, with Petter Solberg joining the team halfway through the season, driving in the Rallye de France. The team finished third in the championship, and Burns took second in the Drivers' Championship for the second year in a row. Burns and Solberg composed Subaru's nominated line-up for the 2001 season with Markko M√§rtin/Michael Park and Toshi Arai/Tony Sircombe competing in selected events. Subaru again won the Driver's Championships in 2001 with Richard Burns and co- driver Robert Reid. Burns left Subaru for Peugeot at the end of the 2001 season. 2002‚Äì2003 Tommi M√§kinen For the 2002 season, Burns was replaced by Tommi M√§kinen and co-driver Kaj Lindstr√∂m. Petter Solberg continued with the team, and Pasi Hagstrom was the team's test driver. Following the October 2001 signing of four time driver's Championship winner M√§kinen, expectations for the team ran high. However, after a season opening win in Monte Carlo, he was only able to finish five more events during the entire season. His teammate, Solberg fared much better, finishing nine events, five of which were podium finishes, including his first ever WRC win, at Rally Great Britain, the season's last round. The win propelled him past Ford's Carlos Sainz into second in the Drivers' Championship. For the 2003 season, the driver line-up remained unchanged from the previous year. Solberg drove the #7 car, M√§kinen the #8 car. The season got off to a poor start, with neither driver finishing the Rallye Monte Carlo. Solberg then scored four outright wins, in Cyprus, Australia, France, and finished the season with his second straight win in Britain, securing him the Driver's Championship for himself and co-driver Phil Mills, narrowly beating S√©bastien Loeb by one point. The team only managed to achieve third place in the manufacturers' championship, beaten by Citroen and Peugeot. At the end of the season, Tommi M√§kinen retired from the WRC. 2004‚Äì2005 Subaru Impreza WRC2005 being driven by Petter Solberg at the Cyprus Rally For the 2004 season, it was originally planned that Solberg would be partnered with the returning Richard Burns. However the Englishman would never get to return to the team because of a brain tumour he developed in late 2003, and would eventually pass away because of cancer in November 2005. Solberg was therefore joined by Finnish driver Mikko Hirvonen and his co- driver Jarmo Lehtinen. Subaru managed to consolidate third place in the Manufacturer's Championship again, while Solberg was second in the Driver's Championship, winning five of the season's rallies: New Zealand, Greece, Japan, Italy and a third consecutive win at Rally Wales. Hirvonen ended the season in seventh place, failing to impress the Subaru team management. He was not re-signed for the 2005 season. In 2005, Petter Solberg again led the team in the #5 car, while Hirvonen was replaced by Chris Atkinson in the #6 car. The young Australian debuted with the Uddeholm Swedish Rally, and finished third at Rally Japan. Petter Solberg achieved back-to-back victories in Mexico and Sweden, early in the season. He finished the season behind S√©bastien Loeb, tied for second place with Marcus Gr√∂nholm. In the Manufacturer's championship, Subaru only managed to finish fourth overall, ahead of Mitsubishi and Skoda. 2006 Chris Atkinson Petter Solberg again led the team throughout the 2006 season, with the second car piloted by Chris Atkinson and co-driver Glenn MacNeall on gravel events, while on tarmac events, it was driven by ex-Formula One driver St√©phane Sarrazin. The WRC2006 had several changes from the previous year's car due to rule changes which banned active differentials as well as water injection, as well as mandating that teams must re-use cars and engines on selected ‚Äòpairs‚Äô of events. Due to the rule changes, the car was introduced on the first round of the season. Subaru's season got off to a poor start, with Solberg unable to score in the first two rallies due to mechanical failures. Due to the teams lacklustre performance, after a decade of running the team, team boss David Lapworth was replaced by Paul Howarth. Not until the third rally of the season, Rally Mexico, would Petter manage to score, achieving a second-place finish. He picked up another second-place finish at Rally Argentina, and again at Rally Australia. The team finished the season in third place in the manufacturer's championship, while Solberg finished in sixth place in the driver's championship. However, the team was not able to achieve a single win, and achieved podium results only four times. Subaru's 2006 season was characterized as disappointing, and was the subject of a Discovery Channel series called Engineering the World Rally. In the programme, Subaru's dismal season was described as 'The Season from Hell'. 2007 Solberg's WRC2007 at Rally GB Solberg again led the team for the 2007 season, driving the #7 Impreza. Sarrazin left the team, leaving Chris Atkinson as the single number two driver, piloting the #8 car. Atkinson managed to grab fourth place at the season opening event in Monte Carlo, after passing the works Ford of Mikko Hirvonen. At the 2007 Rally Portugal, Solberg came in second, following the Ford cars' disqualification due to the glass in their rear windows being too thin. Following the rally, Atkinson's co-driver, Glenn MacNeall, elected to leave the team, and was replaced by St√©phane Pr√©vot, who had previously been with the team as co-driver for Bruno Thiry. At the 2007 Acropolis Rally Solberg managed to achieve a podium position. After the summer break, the team was joined at the 2007 Rally Finland by Xavier Pons and co-driver Xavier Amigo, driving a third car, #25, not nominated for manufacturer points. However, in the rally, Solberg had to retire on day two, after monstrous handling and steering problems which the team engineers were unable to deal with. Solberg finished fifth in Ireland, calling it \\"the most difficult rally he has ever done.\\" At the final event of the season, Wales Rally GB, Solberg won the battle for fourth with Dani Sordo, propelling Subaru to third place in the manufacturer's standings. In the driver's championship, Solberg came in 5th, while Atkinson took 7th. Richard Taylor called the season a \\"poor\\" one, with Subaru only achieving two podium finishes, and no overall wins for the second year in a row. Phil Mills called it the \\"second season from hell.\\" 2008 Petter Solberg and Chris Atkinson continued with the team through the 2008 season. Xavier Pons left the team. With the FIA mandated switch to Pirelli tires, tyre mousse had been banned, and fewer compounds were available. At the first rally of the season, the 2008 Monte Carlo Rally, Atkinson scored his first podium finish on tarmac, after a close battle with Fran√ßois Duval while Solberg finished in fifth. In the 2008 Swedish Rally, Solberg finished in fourth place while Atkinson finished in 21st position following a spin on Special Stage 3, which cost him over 15 minutes. Immediately after the Swedish Rally, the team completed a gravel test in Spain, in preparation for Rally Mexico, the last test using the WRC2007 car. At the 2008 Rally Mexico, Atkinson placed second, his best ever result. Solberg was forced to retire on the second day after a driveshaft failure to his front left wheel. He continued under SupeRally rules on Sunday, finishing 12th. Going into the final day of the 2008 Rally Argentina, Solberg and Atkinson were comfortably in second and third position, poised to put two cars on the podium, a feat Subaru has not accomplished in several years. However, on Special Stage 19, Petter's car suffered an electrical failure, forcing him to retire. Atkinson inherited Solberg's position, and achieved a second-place finish for the second consecutive time. At the 2008 Jordan Rally, on SS6, Solberg's retired after his Impreza suffered from a damper failure, which then spilled oil, lighting a fire under the hood of the car. Solberg restarted under SupeRally rules on Saturday, but crashed on the day's final stage after brake problems. Atkinson managed to secure a third podium in a row, following the suspension failure of Latvala, and the retirements of Solberg and Loeb. Withdrawal from WRC On 16 December 2008, it was announced that Subaru would no longer be competing in the World Rally Championships. The decision was taken by Subaru's parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI), partly as a result of the economic downturn but also because it was felt Subaru had achieved its sporting and marketing objectives. Ikuo Mori denied that alterations to the WRC technical regulations in 2010 or a rumoured deterioration in the working relationship with Prodrive had any impact on the decision. He also said that the possibility of a Subaru car back in the top category of WRC in the future is not zero, but recent events have cited that Subaru will be making a return to WRC in 2021. Vehicle development=Group A Leone, 1980‚Äì1989 As Subaru Rally Team Japan, Subaru entered the first World Rally with the second generation Group A Subaru Leone DL at the 1980 Safari Rally. In 1984 the model was changed to the 3rd generation Leone coup√©, one year later installed with a turbo. The other model used simultaneously with the coup√© turbo until 1989 was the Leone sedan RX Turbo. Group A Legacy RS, 1989‚Äì1993 Prodrive's vehicle development began upon the team's formation in September 1989, creating the Group A Subaru Legacy RS rally car, based on the road going Subaru Legacy sedan. The Legacy was powered by a longitudinally mounted boxer engine, giving it a low centre of gravity. Already equipped with a symmetrical all wheel drive system, it made a good starting point for a rally car. David Lapworth described the development of the car as a \\"steep learning curve.\\" The car lacked power and a weak transmission and braking system also hampered the car. To correct its flaws, Prodrive completed a new car, the 1992 Legacy RS, which featured a totally redesigned fuel injection system, during the 1991 season, introduced on the season's last rally. The team campaigned the 1992 Legacy during the first part of the 1993 season, and on its last rally, achieved the car's first and only win. Subaru Impreza, 1994‚Äì2008Vehicle Preparation Before each rally, each bodyshell is completely rebuilt. In 1993, each bodyshell rebuild took 160 hours. In 2003 it took 650 man hours. In 2006 it took 780 hours.

The school completed its quasquicentennial year of existence in 2015. History In 1830, a free school was established for the Goan community in Mr. Cooper's residence in 68 Bowbazar Street. This was later taken over by the Calcutta Brothers who built a single building in the present location of the school. In 1842, Vicar Apostolic Monsignor Carew of Calcutta was keenly aware of the increasing number of British and European children made fatherless by disease or battle. He saw the need for Congregations of Nuns and Brothers to care for and teach these poor children who were termed 'war orphans'. His immediate choice was the Loreto Sisters and the Irish Christian Brothers. The founding of the school was done about forty years earlier, by a Waterford businessman, Edmund Rice , who had just lost his wife. However, while the Irish nuns arrived in India in 1844 and took up residence at Middleton Row, the Christian Brothers were unable to spare any Brothers for the Indian Mission. As an alternative, the Brothers offered to train men who would form the nucleus of the new Congregation in India. Accordingly, in September, 1847, two young men, Br. Francis Fitzpatrick and his cousin, Br. Alphonsus Tolan, having completed their short spell of training in Ireland, began their long and wearisome voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to Calcutta, arriving on 15 February 1848. They immediately set up the new community of the Calcutta Brothers in the Cathedral compound, Moorghihatta. Br. Francis took charge of the orphanage at Moorghihatta while Br. Alphonsus travelled each day to look after the boys Free School in Bow Bazar. The little Congregation grew slowly but received a setback when both, Vicar Apostolic Carew and Br. Francis died in 1855. It was only in January 1890, that the Irish Christian Brothers were able to set up their mission on a firm footing when four Brothers (Vincent Casey, Fabian Kenneally, Edward Aherne and Ambrose Flynn) came to Calcutta from Ireland at the request of Pope Leo XII. Br. Casey was appointed Provincial Visitor and the amalgamation of the four Irish Christian Brothers and sixteen Calcutta Brothers took place.  St. Joseph's College  In 1894, a new building, the present red- brick structure, was erected under the direction of Br. Joseph Moyes and is now St. Joseph's College, Bow Bazar . This became the Head Office of the Christian Brothers till it was moved to St. Columba's, New Delhi, in 1980. The work that the Brothers were doing received recognition and requests came from several Catholic Bishops for the Brothers to open schools in their dioceses. At the turn of the century - there were nearly fifty Brothers in India, both Irish and Anglo-Indian, and a training house for Brothers (novitiate) was started at Mt Carmel's, overlooking Goethals. St. Joseph's College was affiliated to the ICSE and ISC Boards in the year,1970. St. Joseph's was the Head Office of the Christian Brothers in India till it was moved to St. Columba's, New Delhi in 1980. In 1994, the Ashirvaad Vidyalaya, a bilingual school for the children of migrant workers, was opened on the St. Joseph's and St George's campuses. St. Georges is a free school which is run and managed by St. Joseph's college providing quality education to those who cannot afford it. The books and uniforms all are provided for by St. Joseph's College.

Design and development Designed by Charles B. Kirkham and first tested in 1916, the K-12 featured a cast aluminum upper crankcase and integral cylinder blocks, four valves per cylinder, and \\"wet sleeve\\" construction for improved cooling. It relied upon high rpm and reduction gearing to develop the same power as larger engines. Although technologically advanced, many of the K-12's innovations challenged the state-of-the-art and created serious reliability problems. Most problems were centered on producing reliable reduction gears. The K-12 design, however, led to the development of the very successful Curtiss D-12 (1922) engine used in fighters and racing planes. By 1926 the D-12 design had evolved into the more powerful Curtiss V-1570 \\"Conqueror,\\" noted for its use in military aircraft. That evolution was continued in the powerful liquid-cooled, V-12 aircraft engines of World War II that owed so much to design concepts pioneered in the K-12 engine of 1916.

The history of Lima, the capital of Peru, began with its foundation by Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535. The city was established on the valley of the R√≠mac River in an area populated by the Ichma polity. It became the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. In the 17th century, the city prospered as the center of an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and the Bourbon Reforms. The population of Lima played an ambivalent role in the 1821‚Äì1824 Peruvian War of Independence; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike. After independence, Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru. It enjoyed a short period of prosperity in the mid-19th century until the 1879‚Äì1883 War of the Pacific when it was occupied and looted by Chilean troops. After the war, the city went through a period of demographic expansion and urban renewal. Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru. This gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns as public services failed to keep up with the city expansion. Foundation Pachacamac was an important religious center in pre-Columbian times. In the pre-Columbian era, the location of what is now the city of Lima was inhabited by several Amerindian groups. Prior to the arrival of the Inca Empire, the valleys of the R√≠mac and Lur√≠n rivers were grouped under the Ichma polity.Conlee et al, Late Prehispanic sociopolitical complexity, p. 218. Their presence left a mark in the form of some 40 pyramids associated to the irrigation system of the valleys.Conlee et al, Late Prehispanic sociopolitical complexity, pp. 220‚Äì221. In 1532, a group of Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro ambushed the Inca ruler Atahualpa and searched for a suitable place to establish his capital. His first choice was the city of Jauja, located amid the Andes, however this location was regarded as inconvenient for its high altitude and being far from the sea.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 140, 145. Spanish scouts reported about a better site in the valley of the R√≠mac, which was close to the Pacific Ocean, had ample water and wood provisions, extensive fields and fair weather. Gabriel Moreira Roman√≠ thus founded the city of Lima in Peru's central coast on 18 January 1535.Huerta, p. 37. Carlos Huerta writes in his Chronology of the conquest of the kingdoms of Peru ‚Äì Cronolog√≠a de la conquista de los Reinos del Per√∫: In August 1536, the new city was besieged by the troops of Manco Inca, the leader of an Inca rebellion against Spanish rule. The Spaniards and their native allies, headed by Pizarro himself, defeated the rebels after heavy fighting in the city streets and its surroundings.Hemming, The conquest, p. 203‚Äì206. On November 3, 1536, the Spanish Crown confirmed the founding and, on December 7, 1537, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor granted a coat of arms to the city. Colonial period Nueva cor√≥nica y buen gobierno of Guam√°n Poma de Ayala ca. 1615, it reads: Over the next few years, Lima shared the turmoil caused by struggles between different factions of Spaniards. At the same time it gained prestige as it was designated capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543.Klar√©n, Peru, p. 87. Latin America and Lima's first university, the National University of San Marcos was established in 1551 and its first printing press in 1584. Lima also became an important religious center, a Roman Catholic diocese was established in 1541 and converted to an archdiocese five years later.Klar√©n, Peru, p. 56. In 1609, the city held celebrations for the beatification of Ignatius of Loyola.Report of the Feasts Held in the City of Lima for the Beatification of the Blessed Father Ignatius of Loyola, Founder of the Society of Jesus. World Digital Library, 1610. Lima flourished during the 17th century as the center of an extensive trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty of Peru with the Americas, Europe and the Far East.Andrien, Crisis and decline, pp. 11‚Äì13. Its merchants channeled Peruvian silver through the nearby port of Callao and exchanged it for imported goods at the trade fair of Portobelo in modern-day Panama.Andrien, Crisis and decline, p. 16. This practice was sanctioned by law as all trade from the Viceroyalty was required to go through Callao on its way to and from overseas markets. The resulting economic prosperity of the city was reflected in its rapid growth, population expanded from about 25,000 in 1619 to an estimated 80,000 in 1687.Andrien, Crisis and decline, p. 30. However, Lima was not free from dangers. On October 20 and December 2, 1687, powerful earthquakes destroyed most of the city and its surroundings.Andrien, Crisis and decline, p. 26. The outbreaks of disease and food shortages which followed the disaster caused a reduction of the population to under 40,000 by 1692.Andrien, Crisis and decline, p. 27. A second threat was the presence of pirates and privateers in the Pacific Ocean. A Dutch naval expedition led by Jacques l'Hermite attacked the port of Callao in 1624 but was repelled by Viceroy Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba.Clayton, Local initiative and finance, p. 288‚Äì290. In the 1680s, English buccaneers proliferated in the waters of the Pacific until they were routed by Lima merchants in 1690.Clayton, Local initiative and finance, p. 294‚Äì299. As a precautionary measure, Viceroy Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull built the Lima City Walls between 1684 and 1687.Higgings, Lima, p. 45. The 1687 earthquake marked a turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a recession in trade, a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires.Andrien, Crisis and decline, p. 28. To add to these problems, on October 28, 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy Jos√© Antonio Manso de Velasco.Walker, The upper classes, pp. 53‚Äì55. This disaster led to an intense devotion for an image of Christ called The Lord of the Miracles, which has been taken out in procession every October since 1746.Higgings, Lima, p. 75. During the late colonial period, under the rule of the House of Bourbon, the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control shaped the development of Lima.Ram√≥n, The script, pp. 173‚Äì174. New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring, the Plaza de toros de Acho, as well as the General Cemetery. The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue, while the cemetery put an end to the practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities. Independence Jos√© de San Mart√≠n proclaimed independence in Lima on July 28, 1821. Painting by Juan Lepiani During the second half of the 18th century, Lima was adversely affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata.Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 4‚Äì5. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence.Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 23‚Äì24. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, Jos√© Fernando de Abascal y Sousa. A combined expedition of Argentinian and Chilean patriots under General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n managed to land south of Lima on September 7, 1820 but did not attack the city. Faced with a naval blockade and the action of guerrillas on land, Viceroy Jos√© de la Serna was forced to evacuate the city in July 1821 to save the Royalist army.Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 176‚Äì177. Fearing a popular uprising and lacking any means to impose order, the city council invited San Mart√≠n to enter Lima and signed a Declaration of Independence at his request.Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 178‚Äì180. However, the war was not over; in the next two years the city changed hands several times and suffered exactions from both sides. By the time the war was decided, at the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9, 1824, Lima was considerably impoverished. Republican period International Exposition in 1872. After the war of independence, Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru but economic stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid expansion of the city.Klar√©n, Peru, p. 169. In the next two decades, the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments; these included the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary, and the Dos de Mayo Hospital.Ram√≥n, The script, pp. 174‚Äì176. There were also improvements in communications; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the R√≠mac River, the Balta Bridge, was opened in 1870.Higgings, Lima, pp. 83, 111. The city walls were torn down in 1872 as further urban growth was expected.Ram√≥n, The script, p. 177. However, the export-led economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest.Klar√©n, Peru, p. 170. During the 1879‚Äì1883 War of the Pacific, Chilean troops occupied Lima after defeating Peruvian resistance in the battles of San Juan and Miraflores. The city suffered the depredations of the invaders, which looted public museums, libraries and educational institutions.Higgings, Lima, p. 107. At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian population; sacking their properties and businesses.Klar√©n, Peru, p. 192. The Hotel Bol√≠var was part of an urban renewal process carried out in the early 20th century. After the war, the city underwent a process of urban renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood.Ram√≥n, The script, p. 180‚Äì182. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several buildings of the historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace. On May 24, 1940, an earthquake hit the city, which at that time was mostly built out of adobe and quincha. In the 1940s, Lima started a period of rapid growth spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru. Population, estimated at 0.6 million in 1940, reached 1.9M by 1960 and 4.8M by 1980.Murillo, Lima Metropolitana perfil socio-demogr√°fico, ch. 1.1. At the start of this period, the urban area was confined to a triangular area bounded by the city's historic center, Callao and Chorrillos; in the following decades settlements spread to the north, beyond the R√≠mac River, to the east, along the Central Highway, and to the south.Dietz, Poverty and problem-solving, p. 35. Immigrants, at first confined to slums in downtown Lima, led this expansion through large-scale land invasions which gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns, known as barriadas, renamed as pueblos j√≥venes Dietz, Poverty and problem-solving, p. 36. in the 1980s and latter called \\"Human Settlements\\" during the 1990s. Major public works were carried out throughout this period, mainly under the governments of Manuel A. Odr√≠a (1948‚Äì1956) and Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968‚Äì1975). Brutalism dominated in the 1970s as exemplified in the massive headquarters built for Petroper√∫, the state-owned petroleum company.Higgings, Lima, p. 181. According to the 1993 census, the city population had reached 6.4M; 28.4% of the total population of Peru compared to just 9.4% in 1940.

If the park was constructed, it would have become the sixth Universal Studios theme park in the world, and the fourth in Asia, after Universal Studios Japan, Universal Studios Singapore, and Universal Studios Beijing upon its projected opening in 2020. On 23 December 2015, Universal Studios Korea consortium led by China's largest state-run builder, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, and its largest state-run tourist agency, China Travel Services, won the bidding for the project held by K-Water, the owner of the project site. The consortium also includes the Korean construction firm Daewoo E&C; and Korean engineering consulting firm Dohwa Engineering as well as Universal Studios Korea Property Holdings. In March 2018, Gyeonggi province government, Hwaseong City, K-Water announced that they are trying to restart development of Universal Studios Korea. On April 2020, the province government announced that construction of Universal Studios Korea was now scrapped and plans to build the Disneyland-like resorts in Hwaseong. Development history Universal Studios South Korea was first announced on May 22, 2007 by Frank P. Stanek, the president of USKOR and Associates. While the announcement confirmed that they intended to construct a park in the country, USKOR declined to elaborate on other major details, such as a location and a construction budget, although local officials in the Gyeonggi Province stated that Ansan and Pyeongtaek were among the candidates to host the park.Gyeonggi governor meets Universal Studios chief on theme park construction  Korea.net News On November 27, 2007 Universal Parks & Resorts announced that the park will be constructed in Hwaseong City, located south of Seoul and also near Incheon International Airport, and has been allotted a budget of US$3.1 billion. The selection of South Korea for another theme park was based on many factors. Thomas L. Williams, president of Universal Parks and Resorts, specifically mentioned the country's strong economic growth and its love of American movies. He also noted that approximately half of South Korea's population lived near Seoul. The nation's proximity to China was not lost on the development team. Stanek said, \\"What we are hoping to do is to bring in a world class attraction not only for the Korean people but to draw tourism to this country.\\" Gyeonggi Governor Kim Moon-Soo estimates that Universal Studios South Korea could generate 2.9 trillion won (USD $3.2 billion) in foreign investment, 190 million won per year in tax revenues and 60,000 new jobs. In January 2010, developers of the Universal Studios theme park and resort in South Korea said the project is slated to open in early 2014 after being delayed by the global financial crisis. Plans for Universal Studios Korea Resort, billed as the largest such Universal project in Asia, were originally announced in May 2007 amid hopes it would be up and running in 2012. Kim Moon- Soo, governor of the province in which the resort is set to be built, blamed the worldwide financial meltdown for the delay, but said the large-scale project is back on track. Construction is scheduled to start at the beginning of next year, according to a release. \\"Our Universal Studios in Korea is bigger than all the other studios combined,\\" Kim said at a press event, referring to theme parks already operating in Orlando, Florida and Universal City, California in the United States, Osaka, Japan and the latest Universal Studios Singapore. \\"This will be a remarkable landmark in terms of tourism in Korea,\\" he said. A total of 15 partners are participating in the development, including South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group and builder Posco E&C.; They signed a framework agreement on January 19, 2010, to raise capital for the 3 trillion won ($2.7 billion) project expected to attract 15 million visitors a year in South Korea and from abroad.http://www.whnt.com/business/sns-ap-as- skorea-universal-studios,0,4176446.story On August 15, 2014, it was announced that the project ran by Lotte was cancelled and that K-Water will look for a new consortium.http://m.joongboo.com/articleView.html?idxno=939735 On July 13, 2015, GyeongGi province government announced that they are trying to restart development of Universal Studios Korea.

On June 21, 2016, details for the project is likely to be delayed until August. It will be announced after the appointment K-Water's new CEO that month. Park design No specifics on the layout or attraction lineup were mentioned during the May 2007 press conference, although both USKOR and Universal suggested that the future park might be larger than both Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan. The park will most likely include popular attractions from its sister parks, such as those based on King Kong, Jurassic World, The Mummy, Shrek, Waterworld, The Fast and the Furious, Despicable Me, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, Trolls, Sing and The Secret Life of Pets Universal Parks & Resorts CEO Thomas L.

Retrieved from Google News. It was also noted that the park would have been influenced not only by U.S. movie icons, but those of the South Korean film industry, as well. Competition Universal Studios South Korea will be entering a competitive market, with both established theme parks and others future projects announced by rival studios. The day before the park was made public, MGM had announced plans for a future park in Incheon, which itself was unveiled after Viacom subsidiary Paramount Pictures announced it was exploring the potential for its own theme park near Seoul. Each of these parks would be going up against two popular local parks, Everland and Lotte World. Everland hosted 7.5 million guests in 2006, ranking it fourth in Asia behind the two Tokyo Disney Resort parks and Universal Studios Japan, while Lotte World attracted 5.5 million guests to land in fifth place.

The station was one of the busiest of the intermediate stations on the line and was enlarged in 1897 with the addition of a new platform on the Down side, connected to the main station side via a footbridge. The station also had a goods shed and two sidings. Ironically, the station's final years saw an increased number of passengers using it as residential development took place around the old Forest Row village. In recognition of the increased patronage, commuter trains from London were extended from East Grinstead to terminate here. At the time of closure, Forest Row was taking over ¬£5,000 per annum in revenue and 200 commuters were using the station to travel to London each day. After the station closed, it was used for the filming of an episode of the children's television programme Do Not Adjust Your Set in August/September 1967 featuring a young David Jason. The site was then sold to a club for over ¬£4,000 and the station buildings were quickly swept away. Nevertheless, a short section of the station platforms can still be found, and the goods shed stands together with other light industrial units.

Bowie Seamount lies on the Pacific Plate, a large segment of the Earth's surface which moves in a northwestern direction under the Pacific Ocean. It is adjacent to two other submarine volcanoes; Hodgkins Seamount on its northern flank and Graham Seamount on its eastern flank. Geology=Structure Seamounts are volcanic mountains which rise from the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing. With a height of at least and rising to within only of the sea surface, Bowie Seamount is the shallowest submarine volcano on the British Columbia Coast, as well as in Canadian waters, and one of the shallowest submarine volcanoes in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Most seamounts are found hundreds to thousands of metres below sea level, and are therefore considered to be within the deep sea. In fact, if Bowie Seamount were on land it would be about higher than Whistler Mountain in southwestern British Columbia and lower than Mount Robson, the highest mountain in the Canadian portion of the Rocky Mountains. Bowie Seamount is about long and wide. Its flat-topped summit is made of weakly consolidated tephra and consists of two terraces. The lowest terrace is about below sea level while the highest is about below sea level, but contains steep-sided secondary summits that rise to within below sea level. From a physical perspective, the effective size of the submarine volcano is considerably large. The effects of other submarine volcanoes along the Pacific Northwest, including Cobb Seamount off the coast of Washington, affect the composition and abundance of plankton up to away from the seamount summit due to the upwelling of nutrients from deeper waters. Because of its similar size, Bowie Seamount most likely has a similar effect on its adjacent waters. Eruptive history 3-D depiction of Hodgkins Seamount with Bowie Seamount in the background Bowie Seamount was formed by submarine eruptions along fissures in the seabed throughout the last glacial, or \\"Wisconsinian\\", period, which began about 110,000 years ago and ended between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago. While most submarine volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean are more than one million years old, Bowie Seamount is relatively young. Its base was formed less than one million years ago, but its summit shows evidence of volcanic activity as recently as 18,000 years ago. This is recent in geological terms, suggesting the volcano may yet have some ongoing volcanic activity. Close to Bowie's submerged summit, former coastlines cut by wave actions and beach deposits show that the submarine volcano would once have stood above sea level, as either a single volcanic island or as a small cluster of shoals that would have been volcanically active. Sea levels during the last glacial period, when Bowie Seamount was formed, were at least lower than they are today. It would have had a land area similar to, if not larger than, Midway Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Map of the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain Origins There is some disagreement about the origin of Bowie seamount: Geological studies indicate that the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain may have formed above a center of upwelling magma called a mantle plume. The seamounts comprising the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain would be formed above the mantle plume and carried away from the mantle plume's magmatic source as the Pacific Plate moves in a northwesterly direction towards the Aleutian Trench, along the southern coastline of Alaska. The volcanic rocks which make up some of the seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain are unusual in that they have an acid-neutralizing chemical substance like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie Seamount also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie Seamount seem to have originated from varying degrees of partial melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material. Some aspects of the origin of the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain remain uncertain. The volcanic rocks found at the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts south of Bowie are fresh glassy pillow basalts of recent age, as would be expected if these seamounts are located above or close to a mantle plume south of Haida Gwaii. However, the origin of Bowie Seamount is less certain because even though the seafloor which Bowie lies on formed 16 million years ago during the late Miocene period, Bowie's summit shows evidence of recent volcanic activity. If Bowie Seamount formed above a mantle plume at the site presently occupied by the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts, it has been displaced from its magma source by about at a rate of about per year. The geologic history of Bowie Seamount is consistent with its flat-topped eroded summit, but the source for Bowie's recent volcanic activity remains uncertain. Still others, such as Dickens Seamount and Pratt Seamount further north of Bowie Seamount, fall a little to the side of the chain's expected trend. Another hypothesized origin of some or all seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain is that they formed on top of the Explorer Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary west of Vancouver Island, and have been displaced from it by seafloor spreading. Although some of the seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain appear to follow the expected age progression for a mantle plume trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, are older than that hypothesis would suggest. As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume volcanism. Biology Haida Heritage Centre at Kaay Llnagaay where the Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area was announced Bowie Seamount supports a biologically rich area with a vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, rockfish, halibut and sablefish. Eight species of marine mammal have been found in the Bowie Seamount area, including Steller sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16 varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie Seamount a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean and one of the most biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton. Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area Because of its biological richness, Bowie Seamount was designated as Canada's seventh Marine Protected Area on April 19, 2008 under the Oceans Act and has been described as an \\"Oceanic Oasis\\". The announcement was made by federal Fisheries Minister Loyola Hearn and Gidansda Guujaaw, President of the Council of the Haida Nation, in Skidegate on Haida Gwaii (formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands). During the announcement, Natural Resources Minister Gary Lunn said: \\"Bowie Seamount is an oceanic oasis in the deep sea, a rare and ecologically rich marine area, and our government is proud to take action to ensure it is protected. By working in partnership with the Council of the Haida Nation and groups like the World Wildlife Fund- Canada, we are ensuring this unique treasure is preserved for future generations.\\" It measures about long and wide, totaling an area of . This is the northernmost of the two Marine Protected Areas on the British Columbia Coast; the southernmost is the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents, an active hydrothermal vent zone of the Juan de Fuca Ridge southwest of Vancouver Island. The Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area also includes Peirce Seamount (also called Davidson Seamount) and Hodgkins Seamount. Diving explorations and studies The shallow depth of Bowie Seamount makes it the only underwater mountain off the British Columbia Coast easily reached using scuba diving equipment. In March 1969, dives were made at the submarine volcano by Canadian Forces Maritime Command divers from the CSS Parizeau. Two dives were made to the summit where monochrome photographs were taken to record the environment and some biological samples were gathered to detect possible harmful plants, animals, or bacteria. These specimens were identified at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, creating a list of eleven varieties of sea bottom invertebrates. Eastern flank of Bowie Seamount In August 1969, Canadian Forces Maritime Command divers made more dives during scientific studies by the Fisheries Research Board of Canada. They found very dense shoals of rockfish floating over Bowie's flat-topped summit and a variety of bottom life. A number of monochrome photographs were taken and a few seaweeds were collected, but no species record was created for other types of oceanic life around Bowie Seamount. In November 1996, an issue of the National Geographic Magazine included an article titled \\"Realm of the Seamount\\", describing dives made at Bowie Seamount by two explorers named Bill Curtsinger and Eric Hiner. They explored the slopes of Bowie Seamount using scuba diving equipment down to . Their photographs featured one of Bowie's rugged peaks thickly covered with seaweeds and colourful sea bottom invertebrates. Shoals of young rockfish were seen on Bowie's steep flanks. Scientist Bill Austin of Khoyatan Marine Lab in the Northeast Pacific examined a video made during the National Geographic dives to identify the benthic flora and fauna of Bowie Seamount. From the video, Austin recognized some of the most noticeable invertebrates and noted that a few species generally occurring in the intertidal zone and in shallow subtidal environments were found deeper than might normally be expected, and were bigger than normal. A team of five divers, led by photographer/videographer Neil McDaniel, visited the seamount August 3‚Äì5, 2003 and conducted a biological and photographic survey of the summit down to depths of about . A total of 18 taxa of algae, 83 taxa of conspicuous invertebrates and 12 taxa of fishes were documented, approximately 180 underwater still photographs were taken and approximately 90 minutes of digital video were recorded. Of particular note were the dense schools of rockfish hovering over the summit and numerous curious prowfish. Indigenous people To the Haida, the indigenous people who played a key role in establishing the Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area, the submarine volcano is called S _G_ aan _K_ inghlas. In Haida language it means \\"Supernatural Being Looking Outward\\". Haida have long recognized seamount as a special place. Gidansda Guujaaw, former President of the Council of the Haida Nation, has said: \\"S _G_ aan _K_ inghlas represents a shift in recognizing the need for respect and care for the Earth. This is a very significant turning point in reversing the trends that have been leading to the depletion of life in the sea.\\" Marine hazard Given its shallow depth, Bowie Bank is a potential marine hazard. Waves up to high have been recorded along the British Columbia Coast during heavy weather, enough to expose the bank by wave troughs and cause devastation to any vessel transiting the seamount. For this reason, Environment Canada has recognized Bowie Seamount as a hazard to navigation, and it is avoided by shipping vessels.

The station building survived the closure and is now a private residence named the \\"Old Withyham Station\\"; much of the trackbed as far as Groombridge and Three Bridges are part of the Worth Way and Forest Way cyclepath/footpaths.  History (Staff)  The staff employed at Withyham Station were all appointed on 29 August 1866. They were Mr William Fox, Station Master (previously Station Master, Epsom Downs); William Bell, Assistant Telegraph and Booking Clerk (previously Trainee Signal Clerk at Brighton); Joseph Moore, Porter (previously a Gatekeeper at Lewes) and Charles Farr was the Gatekeeper and Signalman. This later individual had a chequered career having previously been employed as Signalman at Haywards Heath but having been found asleep on duty was reduced in grade and transferred to Hailsham. William Bell was to remain at Withyham until his death on 24 September 1872 when Henry Payne took over at Station Master. He was to remain until his retirement on 20 May 1889. William Kent then became Station Master on transfer from Barcombe on 21 May 1889. He remained until he went to Barcombe Mills on 26 Jan 1894. His replacement was George Brook; his staff record shows he was moved from Barcombe Mills to Withyham due to \\"General Neglect\\". He clearly failed to heed the message of his superiors because he was removed to Brighton as a Clerk on 10 April 1897 due to \\"Incompetency\\". His place was taken by Francis W Baker, appointed as Station Master on 5 April 1897 moving to Falmer on 17 May 1899. Next Edward Vickery, Booking Clerk at Haywards Heath gained promotion as Station Master arriving on 17 May 1899 and leaving to take up the same post at Rotherfield on 24 May 1901.

RAIL414 LB&SCR; Staff Records held in the National Archive  Reopening  With regard to the possible reopening of the remaining section of the line from Groombridge to Three Bridges, a number of physical obstacles would appear to stand in the way of such action, most notably: 1) A bridge over the B2210 near Ashurst Junction has been removed and the embankment cut back. 2) An industrial site currently occupies the former location of Forest Row railway station as well as a small recycling centre to the west. 3) At Forest Row a bridge over the A22 has been removed and the embankment cut back. 4) The formation has been built across in several places notably in East Grinstead where about one mile of the trackbed from Station Road to the Lewes Road tunnel has been taken over for a relief road (the A22 ironically named Beeching Way after local resident Richard Beeching whose recommendations closed the railway line). As there is no feasible alternative route into the station, this road would need to be reconverted back to rail. Any such action would in all likelihood result in a cut in capacity on an already highly congested road network. 5) The site of Grange Road has disappeared under a small parade of shops as well as housing which block 0.64 miles of the formation. 6) The M23 cuts across the trackbed between Three Bridges and Grange Road  Signal Box  The signalbox that controlled the gates at the level crossing at the western end of the station is now preserved at Sheffield Park station on the Bluebell Railway as part of the new museum.

This enzyme belongs to the AKT subfamily of serine/threonine kinases that contain SH2 (Src homology 2-like) domains. It is commonly referred to as PKB, or by both names as \\"Akt/PKB\\".  Function  The serine-threonine protein kinase AKT1 is catalytically inactive in serum- starved primary and immortalized fibroblasts. AKT1 and the related AKT2 are activated by platelet-derived growth factor. The activation is rapid and specific, and it is abrogated by mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1. It was shown that the activation occurs through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In the developing nervous system AKT is a critical mediator of growth factor-induced neuronal survival. Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/threonine kinase AKT1, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery. Mice lacking Akt1 display a 25% reduction in body mass, indicating that Akt1 is critical for transmitting growth-promoting signals, most likely via the IGF1 receptor. Mice lacking Akt1 are also resistant to cancer: They experience considerable delay in tumor growth initiated by the large T antigen or the Neu oncogene. A single- nucleotide polymorphism in this gene causes Proteus syndrome. History AKT (now also called AKT1) was originally identified as the oncogene in the transforming retrovirus, AKT8. AKT8 was isolated from a spontaneous thymoma cell line derived from AKR mice by cocultivation with an indicator mink cell line. The transforming cellular sequences, v-akt, were cloned from a transformed mink cell clone and these sequences were used to identify Akt1 and Akt2 in a human clone library. AKT8 was isolated by Stephen Staal in the laboratory of Wallace P. Rowe; he subsequently cloned v-akt and human AKT1 and AKT2 while on staff at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. In 2011, a mutation in AKT1 was strongly associated with Proteus syndrome, the disease that probably affected the Elephant Man. The name Akt stands for Ak strain transforming. The origins of the Akt name date back to 1928, where J. Furth performed experimental studies on mice that developed spontaneous thymic lymphomas. Mice from three different stocks were studied, and the stocks were designated A, R, and S. Stock A was noted to yield many cancers, and inbred families were subsequently designated by a second small letter (Aa, Ab, Ac, etc.), and thus came the Ak strain of mice. Further inbreeding was undertaken with Ak mice at the Rockefeller Institute in 1936, leading to the designation of the AKR mouse strain. In 1977, a transforming retrovirus was isolated from the AKR mouse. This virus was named Akt-8, the \\"t\\" representing its transforming capabilities.

It is a basic helix-loop-helix PAS domain containing protein, and is considered as the master transcriptional regulator of cellular and developmental response to hypoxia. The dysregulation and overexpression of HIF1A by either hypoxia or genetic alternations have been heavily implicated in cancer biology, as well as a number of other pathophysiologies, specifically in areas of vascularization and angiogenesis, energy metabolism, cell survival, and tumor invasion. Two other alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms have been identified.  Structure  HIF1 is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix structure that is composed of HIF1A, the alpha subunit (this protein), and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), the beta subunit. HIF1A contains a basic helix- loop-helix domain near the C-terminal, followed by two distinct PAS (PER-ARNT- SIM) domains, and a PAC (PAS-associated C-terminal) domain. The HIF1A polypeptide also contains a nuclear localization signal motif, two transactivating domains CTAD and NTAD, and an intervening inhibitory domain (ID) that can repress the transcriptional activities of CTAD and NTAD. There are a total of three HIF1A isoforms formed by alternative splicing, however isoform1 has been chosen as the canonical structure, and is the most extensively studied isoform in structure and function.  Gene and expression  The human HIF1A gene encodes for the alpha subunit, HIF1A of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1) . Its protein expression level can be measured by antibodies against HIF-1-alpha through various biological detection methods including western blot or immunostaining. HIF1A expression level is dependent on its GC-rich promoter activation. In most cells, HIF1A gene is constitutively expressed in low levels under normoxic conditions, however, under hypoxia, HIF1A transcription is often significantly upregulated. Typically, oxygen-independent pathway regulates protein expression, and oxygen-dependent pathway regulates degradation. In hypoxia- independent ways, HIF1A expression may be upregulated through a redox- sensitive mechanism.  Function  Nobel Prize in Physiology/ Medicine 2019: Cellular Oxygen Sensing and Adaption by Hif-alpha The transcription factor HIF-1 plays an important role in cellular response to systemic oxygen levels in mammals. HIF1A activity is regulated by a host of post-translational modifications: hydroxylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation. HIF-1 is known to induce transcription of more than 60 genes, including VEGF and erythropoietin that are involved in biological processes such as angiogenesis and erythropoiesis, which assist in promoting and increasing oxygen delivery to hypoxic regions. HIF-1 also induces transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, as well as glucose and iron metabolism. In accordance with its dynamic biological role, HIF-1 responds to systemic oxygen levels by undergoing conformational changes, and associates with HRE regions of promoters of hypoxia-responsive genes to induce transcription. HIF1A stability, subcellular localization, as well as transcriptional activity are especially affected by oxygen level. The alpha subunit forms a heterodimer with the beta subunit. Under normoxic conditions, VHL-mediated ubiquitin protease pathway rapidly degrades HIF1A; however, under hypoxia, HIF1A protein degradation is prevented and HIF1A levels accumulate to associate with HIF1B to exert transcriptional roles on target genes Enzymes prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and HIF prolyl hydroxylase (HPH) are involved in specific post- translational modification of HIF1A proline residues (P402 and P564 within the ODD domain), which allows for VHL association with HIF1A. The enzymatic activity of oxygen sensor dioxygenase PHD is dependent on oxygen level as it requires oxygen as one of its main substrates to transfer to the proline residue of HIF1A. The hydroxylated proline residue of HIF1A is then recognized and buried in the hydrophobic core of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), which itself is part of a ubiquitin ligase enzyme. The hydroxylation of HIF1A proline residue also regulates its ability to associate with co-activators under hypoxia. Function of HIF1A gene can be effectively examined by siRNA knockdown based on an independent validation.  Repair and regeneration  In normal circumstances after injury HIF1A is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). In June 2015, scientists found that the continued up-regulation of HIF1A via PHD inhibitors regenerates lost or damaged tissue in mammals that have a repair response; and the continued down-regulation of HIF1A results in healing with a scarring response in mammals with a previous regenerative response to the loss of tissue. The act of regulating HIF1A can either turn off, or turn on the key processes of mammalian regeneration. One such regenerative process in which HIF1A is involved is peripheral nerve regeneration. Following axon injury, HIF1A activates VEGFA to promote regeneration and functional recovery.  Regulation  HIF1A abundance (and its subsequent activity) is regulated transcriptionally in an NF-Œ∫B-dependent manner. In addition, the coordinated activity of the prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) maintain the appropriate balance of HIF1A protein in the post- translation phase. PHDs rely on iron among other molecules to hydroxylate HIF1A; as such, iron chelators such as desferrioxamine (DFO) have proven successful in HIF1A stabilization. HBO (Hyperbaric oxygen therapy) and HIF1A imitators such as cobalt chloride have also been successfully utilized.

HIF1A overexpression is heavily implicated in promoting tumor growth and metastasis through its role in initiating angiogenesis and regulating cellular metabolism to overcome hypoxia. Hypoxia promotes apoptosis in both normal and tumor cells. However, hypoxic conditions in tumor microenvironment especially, along with accumulation of genetic alternations often contribute to HIF1A overexpression. Significant HIF1A expression has been noted in most solid tumors studied, which include cancers of the gastric, colon, breast, pancreas, kidneys, prostate, ovary, brain, and bladder. Clinically, elevated HIF1A levels in a number of cancers, including cervical cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, breast cancer (LV-positive and negative), oligodendroglioma, oropharyngeal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, and stomach cancer, have been associated with aggressive tumor progression, and thus has been implicated as a predictive and prognostic marker for resistance to radiation treatment, chemotherapy, and increased mortality.HIF1A expression may also regulate breast tumor progression. Elevated HIF1A levels may be detected in early cancer development, and have been found in early ductal carcinoma in situ, a pre-invasive stage in breast cancer development, and is also associated with increased microvasculature density in tumor lesions. Moreover, despite histologically-determined low- grade, lymph-node negative breast tumor in a subset of patients examined, detection of significant HIF1A expression was able to independently predict poor response to therapy. Similar findings have been reported in brain cancer and ovarian cancer studies as well, and suggest at regulatory role of HIF1A in initiating angiogenesis through interactions with pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF. Studies of glioblastoma multiforme show striking similarity between HIF1A expression pattern and that of VEGF gene transcription level. In addition, high-grade glioblastoma multiform tumors with high VEGF expression pattern, similar to breast cancer with HIF1A overexpression, display significant signs of tumor neovascularization. This further suggests the regulatory role of HIF1A in promoting tumor progression, likely through hypoxia-induced VEGF expression pathways. HIF1A overexpression in tumors may also occur in a hypoxia-independent pathway. In hemangioblastoma, HIF1A expression is found in most cells sampled from the well-vascularized tumor. Although in both renal carcinoma and hemangioblastoma, the von Hippel-Lindau gene is inactivated, HIF1A is still expressed at high levels. In addition to VEGF overexpression in response elevated HIF1A levels, the PI3K/AKT pathway is also involved in tumor growth. In prostate cancers, the commonly occurring PTEN mutation is associated with tumor progression toward aggressive stage, increased vascular density and angiogenesis. During hypoxia, tumor suppressor p53 overexpression may be associated with HIF1A-dependent pathway to initiate apoptosis. Moreover, p53-independent pathway may also induce apoptosis through the Bcl-2 pathway. However, overexpression of HIF1A is cancer- and individual- specific, and depends on the accompanying genetic alternations and levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors present. One study on epithelial ovarian cancer shows HIF1A and nonfunctional tumor suppressor p53 is correlated with low levels of tumor cell apoptosis and poor prognosis. Further, early-stage esophageal cancer patients with demonstrated overexpression of HIF1 and absence of BCL2 expression also failed photodynamic therapy. While research efforts to develop therapeutic drugs to target hypoxia-associated tumor cells have been ongoing for many years, there has not yet been any breakthrough that has shown selectivity and effectiveness at targeting HIF1A pathways to decrease tumor progression and angiogenesis. Successful therapeutic approaches in the future may also be highly case-specific to particular cancers and individuals, and seem unlikely to be widely applicable due to the genetically heterogenous nature of the many cancer types and subtypes.

In humans the MMP9 gene encodes for a signal peptide, a propeptide, a catalytic domain with inserted three repeats of fibronectin type II domain followed by a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain.  Function  Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, angiogenesis, bone development, wound healing, cell migration, learning and memory, as well as in pathological processes, such as arthritis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. The enzyme encoded by this gene degrades type IV and V collagens and other extracellular matrix proteins. Studies in rhesus monkeys suggest that the enzyme is involved in IL-8-induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow, and murine studies suggest a role in tumor-associated tissue remodeling. Thrombospondins, intervertebral disc proteins, regulate interaction with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, which are key effectors of ECM remodeling.  Neutrophil action  MMP9, along with elastase, appears to be a regulatory factor in neutrophil migration across the basement membrane. MMP9 plays several important functions within neutrophil action, such as degrading extracellular matrix, activation of IL-1Œ≤, and cleavage of several chemokines. In a mouse model, MMP9 deficiency resulted in resistance to endotoxin shock, suggesting that MMP9 is important in sepsis.  Angiogenesis  MMP9 may play an important role in angiogenesis and neovascularization. For example, MMP9 appears to be involved in the remodeling associated with malignant glioma neovascularization. It is also a key regulator of growth plate formation- both growth plate angiogenesis and the generation of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Knock-out models of MMP9 result in delayed apoptosis, vascularization, and ossification of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Lastly, there is significant evidence that Gelatinase B is required for the recruitment of endothelial stem cells, a critical component of angiogenesis  Wound repair  MMP9 is greatly upregulated during human respiratory epithelial healing. Using a MMP9 deficient mouse model, it was seen that MMP9 coordinated epithelial wound repair and deficient mice were unable to remove the fibrinogen matrix during wound healing. When interacting with TGF-√ü1, Gelatinase B also stimulates collagen contraction, aiding in wound closure.  Structure  ProMMP9 (pro-peptide (red), catalytic domain (green) with fibronectin domains (cyan), with detail of the \\"cysteine switch\\" (from PDB entry 1L6J) MMP9 is synthesized as preproenzyme of 707 amino-acid residues, including a 19 amino acid signal peptide and secreted as an inactive pro-MMP. The human MMP9 proenzyme consists of five domains. The amino-terminal propeptide, the zinc-binding catalytic domain and the carboxyl-terminal hemopexin-like domain are conserved. Its primary structure comprises several domain motifs. The propeptide domain is characterized by a conserved PRCGVPD sequence. The Cys within this sequence is known as the ‚Äúcysteine switch‚Äù. It ligates the catalytic zinc to maintain the enzyme in an inactive state. MMP-9 catalytic domain in complex with a fluorogenic synthetic peptidic substrate. From PDB entry 4JIJ. Activation is achieved through an interacting protease cascade involving plasmin and stromelysin 1 (MMP-3). Plasmin generates active MMP-3 from its zymogen. Active MMP-3 cleaves the propeptide from the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9, yielding an 82-kDa enzymatically active enzyme. In the active enzyme a substrate, or a fluorogenic activity probe., replaces the propetide in the enzyme active site where it is cleaved. The catalytic domain contains two zinc and three calcium atoms. The catalytic zinc is coordinated by three histidines from the conserved HEXXHXXGXXH binding motif. The other zinc atom and the three calcium atoms are structural. A conserved methionine, which forms a unique ‚ÄúMet-turn‚Äù structure categorizes MMP9 as a metzincin. Three type II fibronectin repeats are inserted in the catalytic domain, although these domains are omitted in most crystallographic structures of MMP9 in complex with inhibitors.The active form of MMP9 also contains a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain. This domain is ellipsoidal in shape, formed by four Œ≤-propeller blades and an Œ±-helix. Each blade consists of four antiparallel Œ≤-strands arranged around a funnel-like tunnel that contains two calcium and two chloride ions. The hemopexin domain is important to facilitate the cleavage of triple helical interstitial collagens. .  Clinical significance  MMP9 has been found to be associated with numerous pathological processes, including cancer, placental malaria, immunologic and cardiovascular diseases.  Arthritis  Elevated MMP9 levels can be found in the cases of rheumatoid arthritis and focal brain ischemia.  Cancer  One of MMP9's most widely associated pathologies is the relationship to cancer, due to its role in extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. For example, its increased expression was seen in a metastatic mammary cancer cell line. Gelatinase B plays a central role in tumor progression, from angiogenesis, to stromal remodeling, and ultimately metastasis. However, because of its physiologic function, it may be difficult to leverage Gelatinase B inhibition into cancer therapy modalities. However, Gelatinase B has been investigated in tumor metastasis diagnosis- Complexes of Gelatinase B/Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases are seen to be increased in gastrointestinal cancer and gynecologic malignancies MMPs such as MMP9 can be involved in the development of several human malignancies, as degradation of collagen IV in basement membrane and extracellular matrix facilitates tumor progression, including invasion, metastasis, growth and angiogenesis.  Cardiovascular  MMP9 levels increase with the progression of idiopathic atrial fibrillation. MMP9 has been found to be associated with the development of aortic aneurysms, and its disruption prevents the development of aortic aneurysms. Doxycycline suppresses the growth of aortic aneurysms through its inhibition of MMP9.  Pregnancy-associated malaria (Placental malaria)  A study on Ghanaian population showed that MMP-9 single nucleotide polymorphism 1562 C > T (rs3918242) was protective against placental malaria which suggests a possible role of MMP-9 in susceptibility to malaria.  Dry eye  Dry eye patients, especially with meibomian gland dysfunction exhibit higher levels of MMP-9.

He was one of five defendants tried and acquitted in Illinois of the murder in 1844 of Joseph Smith, who was founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Founding of Warsaw and political leadership Aldrich was born in New York and moved to Hancock County, Illinois, in 1832, where he was one of the early developers of what would later become the town of Warsaw. Aldrich was appointed as the first postmaster of Warsaw, serving between 1834 and 1838. In 1836 and 1838 he was elected to the Illinois Senate as the representative for Hancock County. Early involvement with the Latter Day Saints In the late 1830s, Latter Day Saints began settling in Hancock County. According to Latter Day Saint leader Joseph Smith, Aldrich spent two years trying to convince Smith and the Latter Day Saints to purchase a section of land south of Warsaw which Aldrich owned.Joseph Smith, B.H. Roberts (ed.). History of the Church 4:405, 471. In 1841, Smith finally relented and some of the Latter Day Saints settled as Aldrich's tenants in what would be called Warren, Illinois. However, once the Latter Day Saints had settled there, Aldrich raised the rent and imposed a number of restrictions on the Latter Day Saints that had not been foreseen. As a result, Smith moved the Latter Day Saints settled in Warren to Nauvoo, where the majority of Latter Day Saints had settled. Aldrich was unsuccessful in his attempts to persuade Smith to continue their arrangement.Joseph Smith, B.H. Roberts (ed.). History of the Church 4:486, 471‚Äì72.

He is known as the author of the diaries from the years 1941‚Äì1946 which were published in Germany, Sweden and Russia. The book with the diaries-notices of the officer in the Red Army Vladimir Gelfand: German Diary 1945‚Äì1946 (Deutschland-Tagebuch 1945‚Äì1946) ‚Äì Notations of a Soldier in the Red Army has become the first one which is published in Germany. Biography= Childhood and youth  Vladimir Gelfand was the only child in a poor Jewish family. Vladimir‚Äôs mother, Nadezhda Vladimirovna Gorodynskaya (1902-1982), was from a low-income family with eight children. In her youth, she earned money by giving private lessons. In 1917, she joined the RSDLP (b) and, as Vladimir mentioned in his biography, took part in the Civil War. In the 1920s, she was expelled from the party with the wording ‚Äúfor passivity‚Äù. This interfered with her career, but saved her from subsequent repressions. Father, Nathan Solomonovich Gelfand (1894-1974), worked at a cement plant in Dneprodzerzhinsk. Unlike his wife, he remained non-partisan. In 1926, in search of a livelihood, the young family moved to the Caucasus. Vladimir and his parents settled in Essentuki, where his father‚Äôs parents lived, but already in 1928 returned to Ukraine in the city of Dneprodzerzhinsk, Dnipropetrovsk region. Here, his father worked as a foreman at a metallurgical plant and, according to Vladimir's diaries, was a \\"drummer\\". Mother was a teacher in a factory kindergarten, which Vladimir, among other children, went to. In 1932, she changed jobs, moving to the personnel department of a large metallurgical enterprise. In 1933, the family moved to Dnepropetrovsk. Vladimir's parents broke up when he was in school. Nevertheless, he studied successfully. During his school years he took an active part in public life: he was an editor of the wall newspaper, an organizer of art recitation contests, an agitator-propagandist, and joined the Komsomol. After high school, Vladimir entered the Dnepropetrovsk Industrial Workers' Faculty (now the National Metallurgical Academy of Ukraine), having managed to study there three courses before the war.  Years of war  The German attack on the Soviet Union interrupted the formation of Gelfand. When enterprises, public institutions and a significant part of the city‚Äôs population were evacuated in August 1941, Vladimir moved to Yessentuki, where he settled with his aunt, his father‚Äôs sister. In Essentuki, Vladimir worked as an electrician and had reservation armor. Nevertheless, in April 1942 he turned to the draft board and on May 6 became a member of the Red Army. He was trained at an artillery school near Maykop in the western Caucasus and received the military rank of sergeant. In July 1942, when the Caucasian oil fields became the direct target of the German offensive, Vladimir Gelfand was on the southern flank of the Kharkov Front (as he writes in his Diary, entry dated 06.16.1942) as commander of the mortar squad. The unit in which Gelfand served retreated with the army to the Rostov area. In mid-July, she was surrounded and destroyed. As part of a small group of soldiers, Vladimir managed to break out of encirclement and join the units of the 62nd Army under the command of Vasily Chuikov, who fought in Stalingrad. Sergeant Gelfand, being the commander of the mortar squad, was simultaneously appointed deputy platoon commander for political work. He wrote a statement on joining the Communist Party and became a candidate for its members. Towards the end of 1942, hostilities in the Stalingrad region were nearing victory. In December, Vladimir was wounded in the arm and ended up in a military hospital near Saratov, where he stayed until February 1943. After discharge, he received a referral to the rifle school of officers near Rostov, liberated from the Germans. In the summer of 1943, Vladimir Gelfand managed to re-establish contact with his mother, who was evacuated to Central Asia. From her letter, he learned that almost all of his paternal relatives in Essentuki occupied by the Nazis - grandmother, uncle, two aunts and two cousins - were killed during an action to exterminate the Jews. Only his father and father‚Äôs brother survived, who, before the Germans arrived, managed to escape to Derbent, crossing the Caucasus ridge. Vladimir underwent a three-month training in the courses of officers and received the military rank of junior lieutenant. At the end of August 1943, he was transferred to the 248th Infantry Division, where he took command of a mortar platoon. In the fall of 1943, the 248th Infantry Division became part of the 3rd Ukrainian Front and took up positions south of Melitopol. At the end of January 1944, Vladimir Gelfand received the rank of lieutenant. Since November 1943, he became a full member of the CPSU(B). In the fall of 1943, Gelfand participated in crossing the Dnieper. In early May 1944, part of it crossed the Dniester near Grigoriopol. A new offensive in the southern part of the front led Gelfand in Bessarabia in August 1944. Columns of prisoners of war and captive traitors (Vlasovites) were increasingly found. In the diary, he describes the hatred of the Red Army towards the prisoners, especially in relation to the traitors. In the fall of 1944, his unit was located in Poland east of Warsaw. The diary is filled with notes on meetings with the Polish civilian population. At the beginning of 1945, the Red Army was preparing for two strong offensive operations: an attack on the Vistula-Oder and an attack on East Prussia. To this end, more than 3 million Soviet soldiers were reorganized and supplied. The battle was to end with the encirclement of Berlin. The Red Army was opposed by the still powerful enemy, which was ready at the borders of its country for stubborn resistance. On January 12 and 13, the Soviet army went on the offensive. In 1945, Gelfand served in the 1052th Infantry Regiment of the 301st Division. Since October 1944, the 301st Division belonged to the 5th Army of Colonel General Berzarin within the 1st Belorussian Front, commanded by Army General Zhukov. Vladimir Gelfand received command of a mortar platoon in the 3rd battalion. On the morning of January 14, 1945, an offensive began south of Warsaw on the Pilice River. After 2 weeks, the 1052 rifle regiment reached the German border, broken in 1939 by the Wehrmacht. Gelfand's diary entries indicate fatigue, but also pride and the expectation of victory. In early February 1945, part of it from the north advanced on the western shore of the Oder. In the memoirs of the division commander, Colonel Antonov, it is reported that the 3rd battalion of the 1052th rifle regiment was supposed to reflect the enemy‚Äôs particularly cruel counterattacks. In anticipation of the Berlin operation, Gelfand was appointed to the headquarters of the 301st division of General Antonov to maintain the Journal of Military Operations. In mid-April, the 301st division, located in Kustrin, went on the offensive on Berlin. Gelfand independently visited the fighting positions of units and divisions of the division. In late April, Vladimir Gelfand as part of the 301st Infantry Division took part in the assault on Berlin.  After the war  After the Victory, Gelfand hoped for dismissal from the army. However, he was not demobilized neither in the first wave of demobilization (in accordance with the decree of June 23, 1945), nor in the second wave (in accordance with the decree of September 25, 1945). In June 1945, Gelfand did not have a specific task. When the looting of the Science Library began, he considered it ‚Äúshameful barbarism‚Äù (entry dated June 16/17). In early July, he arrived on the board of an officer reserve near the village of R√ºders. During this period, Gelfand tried to get the post of political worker or (after language courses) translator. In August 1945, when the USSR declared war on Japan, Gelfand predicted an imminent victory in this war, while many of his colleagues feared that the war in the Far East would last several months or even years. In October 1945, Gelfand was assigned to the Materials and Equipment Base in Kremmen, northwest of Berlin, which was assigned to the 21st Independent Trophy Brigade. The base‚Äôs transport department initially consisted of three (in early 1946), then six officers, as well as technical staff from sergeants. Lieutenant Gelfand manned consignments of various goods in the Soviet units and accompanied them, organized the transportation and dismantling of restitution property. During his work, he was constantly between Nauen, Potsdam, Velten, Kremmen, Hennigsdorf, Sch√∂newalde, F√ºrstenberg and Berlin. At the beginning of 1946, he was briefly appointed head of production at the Kremennsky sawmill, where six soldiers and two horse teams were subordinate to him. In addition, he had to take guard at the Base. His salary was 750 rubles. At the end of 1945, in Ukraine (at that time), a kilogram of sugar in the market cost 250 rubles, a kilogram of rye bread on average 24 rubles, so Vladimir, who sent money to his mother, was her weak helper. There he served until demobilization in September 1946. In July 1946, he applied for leave. Together with his parents, he resorted to a trick: medical certificates were sent to the command about the poor state of health of the mother, the plight of the family was dramatized. Mother even wrote a letter to Stalin. But he was not granted leave. September 10, 1946 Vladimir Gelfand was demobilized. Vladimir returned to Dnepropetrovsk to his mother. In September 1947, he began his studies at the Faculty of History and Philology of Dnepropetrovsk State University. In February 1949, he married a girl whom he had known since studying at school and during the war was in correspondence with her. Berta Davidovna Koifman finished her studies at the Molotov (since 1958 Perm) medical institute. In the summer of 1949, Vladimir Gelfand transferred to Molotov (since 1958 Perm) State University. In 1950, son Alexander was born. In 1952, Vladimir Gelfand graduated from Molotov University. He wrote a thesis on the novel by Ilya Ehrenburg \\"The Tempest\\" (1947). In February 1951, Gelfand met with Ilya Ehrenburg in Moscow. Since August 1952, Vladimir worked as a teacher of history, the Russian language and literature at the Zheleznodorozhniki College No. 2 in Molotov. Soon the marriage with Berta was in crisis. In 1955, Vladimir left his wife and son and returned to Dnepropetrovsk, where he joined the city Technical College as a teacher. In 1957, Vladimir Gelfand met with a graduate of the Institute of Pedagogical Education of Makhachkala, Bella Efimovna ShulmanBella Gelfand. How in Berlin they killed the wife of the Red Armyman Vladimir Gelfand. In August 1958, Vladimir divorced his first wife and soon married Bella. Two sons were born from this marriage: in 1959 - Gennady, in 1963 - Vitaliy. Despite a higher pedagogical education, Bella was not able to get a teaching position in high school. Today, Bella attributes it to latent, partially even open antisemitism. ‚ÄúAs long as I am here as a school district council,‚Äù said one head, ‚Äúno Jew will work in high school.‚Äù Thus, Bella with higher education worked in kindergarten, and Vladimir remained his whole life a teacher of social science, history and political economy in vocational schools, first in the 12th, and since 1977 in the 21st city of Dnepropetrovsk. Gelfand remained an active member of the party, took part in the work of the party group of the school. Fierce discussions took place there from time to time. Antisemitic insults, even from colleagues, were not uncommon. Gelfand wrote continuously. Gelfand offered the local press not only articles about school workdays and work results, but also his memories of the war. The late seventies became his most productive. The collection of newspaper publications covers 7 articles from 1968, 20 from 1976, 30 from 1978. They appeared in Ukrainian and Russian in local party newspapers and Komsomol newspapers, as well as in newspapers for builders. Living conditions remained difficult. For more than 10 years, the Gelfand family of four has rented a private living space.  Reviews of his books  \\"These are very private, uncensored experiences and sentiments of a Red Army Officer as an occupier of Germany. His account of the end of World War II in Germany and the German society that underwent its post- war crisis is also highly instructive. Apart from offering a different view on the spirit and the moral condition of the Red Army which was often represented in an exaggeratedly glorifying manner in the Soviet media, the diary contradicts to the commonly held belief that explains the military success of the Red Army by systematic repressions. Furthermore, the diary depicts the growing self-confidence of the front soldiers Stalin was so afraid of. Gelfand represents a certain group among the conquerors, namely the young officers who were sure that their front experience gave them the right to laugh at a dull instructor, to avert denunciation, to speak plainly to a high-ranged party functionary or to go their own way in occupied Germany. Gelfand‚Äôs experience with women also proves the existence of love relations between masculine conquerors and feminine conquered in 1945‚Äì46. The diary illustrates that German women searched contact to Soviet soldiers on their part, too, and that not only for material matters or in need of protection.\\" Dr. Elke Scherstjanoi, Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ), Munich-Berlin \\"A Diary of a Soviet Soldier‚Äîit is the description of reality that makes it so impressive, a reality that had been disclaimed for a long time and of everyday life that had never been depicted. Despite all atrocities it is a very interesting book to read, though it appeared many years after it had been written. It is most gratifying that this diary eventually became available after 60 years, even if only in German yet, because this is a view of the events that was missing. This diary is the first book that presents Soviet vanquishers as flesh and blood people and helps to understand the inner world of Soviet soldiers. It will be difficult for Putin and his post-soviet guards to lock up this diary into the poison cupboard for anti-Russian propaganda.\\"DNet Per Landin, Dagens Nyheter, Sweden \\"Gelfand‚Äôs ‚ÄúGerman Diary 1945‚Äì1946‚Äù is a remarkable book in every sense. It is the unique eyewitness account of the liberation of Poland and East Germany by the Red Army. The only facts that Soviet soldiers were not allowed for security's sake to keep a diary and that the Ukrainian lieutenant Gelfand had the courage to violate this prohibition is a very good reason to be thankful to the author. Although imperfect in certain respects, this diary surely refutes the assertion of numerous historical revisionists trying to represent the great victory of mankind over Hitler as a barbarian aggression of Stalin's Henchmen against Western civilisation.\\"Flamman Stefan Lindgren, Flamman, Sweden \\"Among the many eye-witness accounts of the end of World War 2 in Germany to emerge in the anniversary year of 2005 was the diary of a young Red Army lieutenant who participated in the capture of Berlin and remained in that city until September 1946.

In humans it is one of two cyclooxygenases. It is involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, an important precursor of prostacyclin, which is expressed in inflammation.  Function  PTGS2 (COX-2), converts arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandin endoperoxide H2. PGHSs are targets for NSAIDs and PTGS2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors called coxibs. PGHS-2 is a sequence homodimer. Each monomer of the enzyme has a peroxidase and a PTGS (COX) active site. The PTGS (COX) enzymes catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins in two steps. First, hydrogen is abstracted from carbon 13 of arachidonic acid, and then two molecules of oxygen are added by the PTGS2 (COX-2), giving PGG2. Second, PGG2 is reduced to PGH2 in the peroxidase active site. The synthesized PGH2 is converted to prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2Œ±), prostacyclin (PGI2), or thromboxane A2 by tissue-specific isomerases.(Figure 2) While metabolizing arachidonic acid primarily to PGG2, COX-2 also converts this fatty acid to small amounts of a racemic mixture of 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids (i.e., 15-HETEs) composed of ~22% 15(R)-HETE and ~78% 15(S)-HETE stereoisomers as well as a small amount of 11(R)-HETE. The two 15-HETE stereoisomers have intrinsic biological activities but, perhaps more importantly, can be further metabolized to a major class of agents, the lipoxins. Furthermore, aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes arachidonic acid almost exclusively to 15(R)-HETE which product can be further metabolized to epi-lipoxins. The lipoxins and epi-lipoxins are potent anti-inflammatory agents and may contribute to the overall activities of the two COX's as well as to aspirin. COX-2 is naturally inhibited by calcitriol (the active form of Vitamin D).  Mechanism  Arachidonic acid bound to the PTGS2 (COX-2) enzyme. polar interactions between Archidonic Acid (cyan) and Ser-530 and Tyr-385 residues are shown with yellow dashed lines. The substrate is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Mechanism of COX activation and catalysis. A hydroperoxide oxidizes the heme to a ferryl-oxo derivative that either is reduced in the first step of the peroxidase cycle or oxidizes Tyrosine 385 to a tyrosyl radical. The tyrosyl radical can then oxidize the 13-pro(S) hydrogen of arachidonic acid to initiate the COX cycle. Both the peroxidase and PTGS activities are inactivated during catalysis by mechanism-based, first-order processes, which means that PGHS-2 peroxidase or PTGS activities fall to zero within 1‚Äì2 minutes, even in the presence of sufficient substrates. The conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 can be shown as a series of radical reactions analogous to polyunsaturated fatty acid autoxidation. The 13-pro(S) -hydrogen is abstracted and dioxygen traps the pentadienyl radical at carbon 11. The 11-peroxyl radical cyclizes at carbon 9 and the carbon-centered radical generated at C-8 cyclizes at carbon 12, generating the endoperoxide. The allylic radical generated is trapped by dioxygen at carbon 15 to form the 15-(S) -peroxyl radical; this radical is then reduced to PGG2 . This is supported by the following evidence: 1) a significant kinetic isotope effect is observed for the abstraction of the 13-pro (S )-hydrogen; 2) carbon-centered radicals are trapped during catalysis; 3) small amounts of oxidation products are formed due to the oxygen trapping of an allylic radical intermediate at positions 13 and 15. Another mechanism in which the 13-pro (S )-hydrogen is deprotonated and the carbanion is oxidized to a radical is theoretically possible. However, oxygenation of 10,10-difluoroarachidonic acid to 11-(S )-hydroxyeicosa-5,8,12,14-tetraenoic acid is not consistent with the generation of a carbanion intermediate because it would eliminate fluoride to form a conjugated diene. The absence of endoperoxide-containing products derived from 10,10-difluoroarachidonic acid has been thought to indicate the importance of a C-10 carbocation in PGG2 synthesis. However, the cationic mechanism requires that endoperoxide formation comes before the removal of the 13-pro (S )-hydrogen. This is not consistent with the results of the isotope experiments of arachidonic acid oxygenation.  Structure  As shown, different ligands bind either the allosteric or the catalytic subunit. Allosteric subunit binds a non-substrate, activating FA (e.g., palmitic acid). The allosteric subunit with bound fatty acid activates the catalytic subunit by decreasing the Km for AA. PTGS2 (COX-2) exists as a homodimer, each monomer with a molecular mass of about 70 kDa. The tertiary and quaternary structures of PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2) enzymes are almost identical. Each subunit has three different structural domains: a short N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain; an Œ±-helical membrane-binding moiety; and a C-terminal catalytic domain. PTGS (COX, which can be confused with \\"cytochrome oxidase\\") enzymes are monotopic membrane proteins; the membrane-binding domain consists of a series of amphipathic Œ± helices with several hydrophobic amino acids exposed to a membrane monolayer. PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2) are bifunctional enzymes that carry out two consecutive chemical reactions in spatially distinct but mechanistically coupled active sites. Both the cyclooxygenase and the peroxidase active sites are located in the catalytic domain, which accounts for approximately 80% of the protein. The catalytic domain is homologous to mammalian peroxidases such as myeloperoxidase. It has been found that human PTGS2 (COX-2) functions as a conformational heterodimer having a catalytic monomer (E-cat) and an allosteric monomer (E-allo). Heme binds only to the peroxidase site of E-cat while substrates, as well as certain inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib), bind the COX site of E-cat. E-cat is regulated by E-allo in a way dependent on what ligand is bound to E-allo. Substrate and non-substrate fatty acid (FAs) and some PTGS (COX) inhibitors (e.g. naproxen) preferentially bind to the PTGS (COX) site of E-allo. Arachidonic acid can bind to E-cat and E-allo, but the affinity of AA for E-allo is 25 times that for Ecat. Palmitic acid, an efficacious stimulator of huPGHS-2, binds only E-allo in palmitic acid/murine PGHS-2 co-crystals. Non-substrate FAs can potentiate or attenuate PTGS (COX) inhibitors depending on the fatty acid and whether the inhibitor binds E-cat or E-allo. Studies suggest that the concentration and composition of the free fatty acid pool in the environment in which PGHS-2 functions in cells, also referred to as the FA tone, is a key factor regulating the activity of PGHS-2 and its response to PTGS (COX) inhibitors.  Clinical significance  NSAID (non-specific inhibitor of PTGS2 (COX-2)) flurbiprofen (green) bound to PTGS2 (COX-2). Flurbiprofen is stabilized via hydrophobic interactions and polar interactions (Tyr-355 and Arg-120). PTGS2 (COX-2) is unexpressed under normal conditions in most cells, but elevated levels are found during inflammation. PTGS1 (COX-1) is constitutively expressed in many tissues and is the predominant form in gastric mucosa and in the kidneys. Inhibition of PTGS1 (COX-1) reduces the basal production of cytoprotective PGE2 and PGI2 in the stomach, which may contribute to gastric ulceration. Since PTGS2 (COX-2) is generally expressed only in cells where prostaglandins are upregulated (e.g., during inflammation), drug-candidates that selectively inhibit PTGS2 (COX-2) were suspected to show fewer side-effects but proved to substantially increase risk for cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Two different mechanisms may explain contradictory effects. Low-dose aspirin protects against heart attacks and strokes by blocking PTGS1 (COX-1) from forming a prostaglandin called thromboxane A2. It sticks platelets together and promotes clotting; inhibiting this helps prevent heart disease. On the other hand, PTGS2 (COX-2) is a more important source of prostaglandins, particularly prostacyclin which is found in blood vessel lining. Prostacyclin relaxes or unsticks platelets, so selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) increase risk of cardiovascular events due to clotting. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit prostaglandin production by PTGS1 (COX-1) and PTGS2 (COX-2). NSAIDs selective for inhibition of PTGS2 (COX-2) are less likely than traditional drugs to cause gastrointestinal adverse effects, but could cause cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Studies with human pharmacology and genetics, genetically manipulated rodents, and other animal models and randomized trials indicate that this is due to suppression of PTGS2 (COX-2)-dependent cardioprotective prostaglandins, prostacyclin in particular. The expression of PTGS2 (COX-2) is upregulated in many cancers. The overexpression of PTGS2 (COX-2) along with increased angiogenesis and SLC2A1 (GLUT-1) expression is significantly associated with gallbladder carcinomas. Furthermore, the product of PTGS2 (COX-2), PGH2 is converted by prostaglandin E2 synthase into PGE2, which in turn can stimulate cancer progression. Consequently, inhibiting PTGS2 (COX-2) may have benefit in the prevention and treatment of these types of cancer. COX-2 expression was found in human idiopathic epiretinal membranes. Cyclooxygenases blocking by lornoxicam in acute stage of inflammation reduced the frequency of membrane formation by 43% in the dispase model of PVR and by 31% in the concanavalin one. Lornoxicam not only normalized the expression of cyclooxygenases in both models of PVR, but also neutralized the changes of the retina and the choroid thickness caused by the injection of pro-inflammatory agents. These facts underline the importance of cyclooxygenases and prostaglandins in the development of PVR. PTGS2 gene upregulation has also been linked with multiple stages of human reproduction. Presence of gene is found in the chorionic plate, in the amnion epithelium, syncytiotrophoblasts, villous fibroblasts, chorionic trophoblasts, amniotic trophoblasts, as well as the basal plate of the placenta, in the decidual cells and extravillous cytotrophoblasts. During the process of chorioamnionitis/deciduitis, the upregulation of PTGS2 in the amnion and choriodecidua is one of three limited effects of inflammation in the uterus. Increased expression of the PTGS2 gene in the fetal membranes is connected to the presence of inflammation, causing uterine prostaglandin gene expression and immunolocalization of prostaglandin pathway proteins in chorionic trophoblast cells and adjacent decidua, or choriodecidua. PTGS2 is linked with the inflammatory system and has been observed in inflammatory leukocytes. It has been noted that there is a positive correlation with PTGS2 expression in the amnion during spontaneous labour and was discovered to have increased expression with gestational age following the presence of labour with no change observed in amnion and choriodecidua during either preterm or term labour. Additionally, oxytocin stimulates the expression of PTGS2 in myometrial cells.Phillips, Robert J et al. ‚ÄúProstaglandin pathway gene expression in human placenta, amnion and choriodecidua is differentially affected by preterm and term labour and by uterine inflammation.‚Äù BMC pregnancy and childbirth vol. 14 241. 22 Jul. 2014, doi:10.1186/1471-2393-14-241 The mutant allele PTGS2 5939C carriers among the Han Chinese population have been shown to have a higher risk of gastric cancer. In addition, a connection was found between Helicobacter pylori infection and the presence of the 5939C allele.  Interactions  PTGS2 has been shown to interact with caveolin 1.

The canaller The steamship Kamloops was built by Furness Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. in Haverton Hill within Stockton-on-Tees in the northeast of England for Steamships Ltd of Montreal, Quebec. With a length of only 250 feet (75 m) and rated at 2,402 gross tons, the Kamloops was a relatively small vessel for the Great Lakes in the 1920s. She was built to fit inside the locks of the Welland Canal and other Canadian-operated canals of the lower Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River during the years prior to the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The ship had two rigged masts, and a 1000HP triple expansion steam engine with Scotch boilers. Kamloops completed its sea testing on 5 July 1924, then shipped to Copenhagen, Denmark to pick up freight, then on to Montreal and Houghton, Michigan. As a canaller, the Kamloops carried diversified \\"package\\" freight from Canadian port to port. Her chief duty was carrying manufactured goods from Montreal up the lakes to Thunder Bay. During the 1920s, Canada was part of the British Empire; economically fast-growing areas within the Empire, such as the Prairie Provinces, bought a significant quantity of their manufactured goods from the home country, England. Canada's freshwater fleet, including the Kamloops, was an essential link in this vein of imperial commerce. It is the custom of Great Lakes shipping to try to move as much freight as possible before winter and associated ice conditions bring boat movements to a halt. The owners operated the ship as late into the season as possible: in 1924 it was one of the last vessels to pass through the Sault Ste. Marie Canal, and in 1926 it ended the season stuck in the ice in the St. Mary's River. The Kamloops remained under British registry until 1926, when it was nominally purchased by new owners, Canada Steamship Lines, and re- registered in Canada. December 1927 The Kamloops was dispatched up the lakes in late November 1927, carrying a mixed cargo of papermaking machinery, coiled wire for range fencing, shoes, foodstuffs, piping, and tar paper. On 1 December, the steamer called at Courtright, Ontario, to top off its cargo with some bagged salt. It then steamed up Lake Huron, passed through the Sault Ste. Marie Canal on 4 December, and faced the challenge of Lake Superior. Unfortunately for the Kamloops and other vessels assigned to Lake Superior runs, a massive storm began hammering the lake on 5 December. The Kamloops, heavily coated with ice, was last seen steaming towards the southeastern shore of Isle Royale at dusk on the following day, 6 December. A search for the vessel began on 12 December, concentrating on the Keweenaw Peninsula and Isle Royale; the search continued until 22 December. However, the ship and the 22 men and women aboard were never again seen alive. When the 1928 navigation season opened in April, a further search was made for wreckage from the Kamloops. In May, fishermen discovered the remains of several crewmembers at Twelve O'Clock Point on Isle Royale (erroneously reported to be on the nearby Amygdaloid Island) In addition, wreckage from the ship was discovered ashore. In June, more bodies were discovered, and a more comprehensive search for the wreck and crewmembers was undertaken, but nothing was found. Of the nine bodies recovered from the Kamloops, five were identified and the remains shipped to next of kin. Four remained unidentified and were buried at Thunder Bay. A collective memorial stone was placed over their gravesite in 2011. Message in a bottle In December 1928, a trapper working at the mouth of the Agawa River, Ontario, found a bottled note from Alice Bettridge, an assistant stewardess in her early twenties who initially survived the sinking, and, before she herself perished, wrote \\"I am the last one left alive, freezing and starving to death on Isle Royale in Lake Superior. I just want mom and dad to know my fate.\\" Handwriting confirmed by parents. The Kamloops today For fifty years, the Kamloops was one of the Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes, having sunk without a trace. However, on 21 August 1977, her wreck was discovered northwest of Isle Royale, near what is now known as Kamloops Point, by a group of sport divers carrying out a systematic search for the ship. The wreck was discovered sitting on the lake bottom under more than of water. The ship is lying on its starboard side at the bottom of an underwater cliff. The smokestack has detached and is lying a short distance away, near the starboard aft cargo mast. Cargo is strewn near the ship on the lake floor and the holds still contain wire fencing, high-top shoes, candy life-savers, and crates of Honey Bee molasses. There are still human remains aboard the ship. Approximately 50 dives were made to the Kamloops in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the Isle Royale National Park. The cause of her sinking remained a mystery as of 2007. The Kamloops features prominently in the novel A Superior Death by Nevada Barr. The body of a contemporary diver is found together with the historical human remains in the ship's engine room.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 25, 2011 tributary of the Cache La Poudre River in the state of Colorado in the United States. Spring Creek begins north of Horsetooth Mountain within Horsetooth Mountain Park just west of Fort Collins, Colorado and flows into Horsetooth Reservoir. After leaving Horsetooth Reservoir out of Spring Canyon Dam, Spring Creek flows through central Fort Collins just south of Colorado State University. For most of its passage through the city, it is paralleled by the city- maintained Spring Creek Trail. The Spring Creek Trail follows Spring Creek through several parks in mid Fort Collins. It currently extends from Spring Canyon park at the southern end of Overland Trail to the confluence of Spring Creek and the Poudre River where it joins the Poudre Trail. The Spring Creek Trail extends through a new underpass of Taft Hill Road. This highly popular trail continues to Spring Canyon Community Park and the Pineridge Natural Area. The Spring Creek Trail is 6.6 miles. Spring Creek Flood of 1997 From July 27 to July 28, 1997, 14.5 inches of rain fell within the City of Fort Collins, causing Spring Creek to flow over its banks and into surrounding communities. The flash flood transformed this tiny creek into a torrent, killing 5 people and causing an estimated $200 million worth of damage to public and private property, making this event the city's worst natural disaster. The campus and academic buildings of Colorado State University was also severely damaged. Soon after the floods, President Clinton issued disaster declarations for 13 counties affected by the flood event, including Larimer County, which received $5.2 million in aid from FEMA for individual assistance. Colorado State University received $1.2 million in aid from FEMA to pay for repairs to damaged buildings.

Description The community is located in the Sanpete Valley, west of Spring City at the junction of Utah State Route 132 (formerly SR-11 and U.S. Route 189) and Utah State Route 117. The population was 178 at the 2000 census. Chester Ponds (a series of six small reservoirs) are located along the Canal and Oak creeks in the northeastern part of the community. History Chester was founded by David Candland. In the beginning the town was named Canal Creek after the waterway from which the community received its water. Candland then changed the name to Chesterfield after his hometown in England; it was later reduced to Chester. Chester had its own post office until 1967. In August 1885, the San Pete Valley Railway completed its tracks as far south as Chester and began regular service to Nephi (via Moroni and Fountain Green); however, passenger service was not offered until after the \\"Station House\\" was completed. The railway ran north‚Äìsouth through the western part of the community, at about 3300 East. The railway was acquired by Union Pacific Railroad in 1890 and extended farther south to Manti by 1984. The railway was taken over by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG;) in 1908 and became known as the D&RG; San Pete Valley Branch. The branch was later abandoned by the D&RG; (by then known as the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad) in 1947, leaving the Marysvale Branch, through Spring City, as the nearest rail service.

Life His family name was originally Boyron. His father and mother were leading players. He was born in Paris. He was orphaned at age 9, and joined the child company Petits Com√©diens Dauphins at age 12, becoming its brightest star. He came to the notice of Moli√®re, joined his troupe, and eventually became his prot√©g√©. He left the troupe after a conflict with Moli√®re's wife, Armande B√©jart, but rejoined in 1670. He played the role of Domitien in Pierre Corneille's Tite et B√©r√©nice and played in Corneille's Psych√©. He stayed with the troupe until Moli√®re's death in 1673, when he joined the troupe at the Hotel de Bourgogne. This troupe merged with another in 1680 to become the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. With Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, Baron was the undisputed master of the French stage until his retirement in 1691. He created many of the leading roles in Racine's plays, and in his own L'Homme √† bonnes fortunes (1686), his most popular play, and La Coquette. He also wrote Les Enl√®vements and Le Debauche, and translated and acted in two plays by Terence. After retiring in 1691, Baron re-appeared in 1720 at the Palais Royal, and was very active.

Although there are numerous variations of the style for men, women, and children, the basic concept is having a large volume of hair swept upwards from the face and worn high over the forehead, and sometimes upswept around the sides and back as well. Despite the name, this hairstyle has nothing in common with the hairstyle of Madame de Pompadour, who wore her hair back rather than up, with no extra volume on the top. The name was coined in the 20th century. History Adding vertical volume on top of the head, by combing the hair back and up above the forehead, is a trend that originated in women's hairstyles of the royal court in France, first in the 1680s, and again in the second half of the 18th century, long before and after Madame de Pompadour. In 1680, King Louis XIV loved the way his mistress the Duchess of Fontanges arranged her hair after she fell from her horse. She started wearing it like this every day to please him, and created a new hairstyle called the \\"Fontange\\", adding vertical volume to the hair. This fashion lasted for 20 years. Under Louis XV, Madame de Pompadour's time, hair was worn rather low and backswept, with a simple aura of locks, and was never called a pompadour. A new, extravagant style adding again height and volume came into fashion under Louis XVI, around the 1770s and 1780s, culminating before the Revolution with the contemporaries of Marie-Antoinette. Stylists had daring ideas for adding more and more height. The style was revived again in the 1890s as part of the Gibson Girl look and continued to be in vogue until World War I. In the 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, a character refers to Jay Gatsby having had a pompadour in his youth. The style was in vogue for women once again in the 1940s. The men's version appeared in the 1950s and early 1960s, worn by early country, rock and roll and movie stars such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, James Dean, and Tony Curtis, and enjoyed a renaissance in the mid 2000s. The style is worn by men and women in the 21st century, under the modern name pompadour. Women's styles Among women, the hairstyle has become marginally popular again in the first few years of the 21st century. It can be created by backcombing or ratting at the roots of the hair on the sides of the pompadour towards the top of the head. Then the hair is combed up and over the ratted hair, off the forehead, the front up in a curl straight back, and the sides pulled back towards the center.

It was then called by other names (Quiff, ducktail, jelly roll, Rocker, Greaser, or simply \\"the Elvis cut\\"). During the 1980s, the hair style was associated with the \\"rockabilly\\" culture, and adopted by those enamoured with vintage culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s, which included antique cars, hot rods, muscle cars, American folk music, greasers, Teddy Boys, rockabilly bands, and Elvis Presley impersonators. Celebrities known for wearing pompadours during the 1950s and 1960s include Little Richard and Afghanistan's Ahmad Zahir as well as actors such as James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Desi Arnaz. There are Latin variants of the hair style more associated with European and Argentine tango fashion trends and occasionally with late 20th century musical genres such as rockabilly and country. During the 1930s and 1940s, the pompadour and ducktail were popular among hep cats and Mexican zoot suiters. This style has become popular among cholos, Italian Americans and the \\"goombah\\" or \\"Guido\\" subculture. The style is often parodied in shows like The Sopranos or Jersey Shore, which portray negatively stereotyped characters‚Äîespecially Silvio Dante. Notable gangsters, such as John Gotti, have sported the hair style. In modern Japanese popular culture, the pompadour is a stereotypical hairstyle often worn by gang members, thugs, members of the yakuza, the b≈çs≈çzoku, and other similar groups such as the yankii (high-school hoodlums). In Japan the style is known as the \\"Regent\\" hairstyle, and is often caricatured in various forms of entertainment media such as anime, manga, television, and music videos, often into improbable levels of length and volume. The punch perm combines elements of the afro hairstyle and the traditional pompadour. This style, too, is stereotypically worn by less reputable members of society, including the yakuza, b≈çs≈çzoku, and chinpira (street thugs). For the main hero of the long-running manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's fourth part, Diamond is Unbreakable, Josuke Higashikata, the hairstyle became a signature detail. In the psychobilly subculture, the pompadour is slightly modified to form the quiff. The quiff is a hairstyle worn by Psychobilly fans and musicians (Kim Nekroman frontman of Nekromantix for example). A psychobilly wedge is a sort of mix between a mohawk hairstyle and the pompadour, where the hair along the side of the head is shaved and the middle is not spiked but slicked back and stood up like a pompadour.

It was written by Mike Carey and painted by John Bolton. Described by Carey as \\"a Sandman Presents OGN,\\"Take A Dive With Mike Carey Into \\"Wetworks: Worldstorm\\", June 23, 2006, Comic Book Resources it is based on the characters seen in The Sandman, The Dreaming and The Books of Magic, and tells the story of a teenager who gets involved in the conflict between Queen Titania and her predecessor Queen Mab Plot The book is set in London and the protagonist is a rebellious teenager named Linda, who lives with her mum Ava, her dad having left her mother some time ago. The story begins with Queen Mab escaping from the place where she had been confined by Queen Titania in the land of Faerie and overthrowing Titania. The Puck sides with Mab who has since imprisoned Auberon in chains. Linda has a friend named Jeffrey. One night while dragging Jeffrey clubbing, Linda meets up with a stranger named Verian who takes Linda and Jeffrey home where he asks Linda if she wants to be introduced to something new, a drug named Red Horse. Verian prepares this drug by mixing some of Linda's blood with heroin. Linda's relationship with her mother is strained and Linda blames her for her father leaving them. Linda continues her drug abuse, and eventually Verian takes her to border of the Faerie where things have now changed due to Mab's rule. While running back Linda is hit in the arm with an arrow and gets separated from the rest. There she meets Cluracan who heals her wound. He managers to get a promise out of Linda in return for showing her the way back. Cluracan asks her to serve his queen at her need. If the queen should meet Linda and call on her, Linda won't deny her. Cluracan also calls Linda a changeling, a gale sidhe, a turn-dolly which is a fairy child left in exchange for a human one. Linda is brought back into the world, and she snubs Jeffrey who she feels wasn't there when she needed him. While going home Linda meets a hideously ugly woman Titania who is turned away by Ava. Linda leaves Ava who she feels seduced her dad from the Faerie and had kept this fact from her. Linda goes back to Verian who reveals that he is also from the Faerie and explains how cold iron kills fairy. He also tells her that the hot iron in human blood is poison too, but a changelings blood takes the edge of it and mixing it with charmed heroin is what gives it the kick. Linda makes love to Verian, who later on tries to make a hit using her father's christening spoon which he drops, as it is made of iron. The Puck then comes to Verian's room with a bag of heroin and tells Linda that he saw Death go in the corridor and she was with Linda's friend. Linda rushes to the next room to see that Jeffrey has overdosed. Linda makes a brief visit to the dreaming where she meets Lucius, Nuala and The Sandman. She also sees Jeff in a grotesque collection of dead souls which is later revealed as Mabs' heart. when she wakes up she sees Queen Titania who carries her home, where she meets Ava, and reveals that Ava was exiled from faerie, which surprises Linda who had believed it was her dad. Titania also reveals how Mab escaped. Mab who was imprisoned in her cell gave each one who visited her a piece of her heart without their knowing. Then when the fairy were killed it released the fragment of Mab which came together, and Linda realises it is the Red Horse drug that kills the fairy. Titania calls on Linda to fulfill the oath she had made to Cluracan. Ava also comes along to protect her daughter, and it revealed that Ava is the architect of the palace. Ava releases all the faerie who have been trapped by Mab, There is a fight between these faerie and the faerie who are allied with Mab. Linda injects herself with Red Horse, which she mixes with her fathers christening spoon and she is bound to Mab's heart which Titania wants to pull down and destroy. But Mab arrives on the scene and interrupts them. Ava uses her mastery of the palace to trap Mab under a pillar and both she and Titania aim their bows to Mab's heart but their arrows are prevented from meeting their target by the Puck. Mab who says she spared Titania because she feared her death curse chokes Ava and Titania with the strings of their bows thereby preventing them from speaking. The souls of Jeffrey and Linda's dad speak the words \\"Cold Iron\\" and Linda reaches out to her dad's christening spoon and hurls it at Mab who is destroyed by it. Titania asks Ava and Linda for any reward. Linda asks for Jeffrey and her dad to be bought back but Titania says she cannot, and asks if there is anything else, to which Linda replies nothing that matters. Verian meets with Linda and informs her that Titania has closed the border, but shows Linda that he still has some stock of heroin and asks Linda to drip for him. Linda remembers the people trapped in Mab's heart killed by the Red horse and walks away. Titania has said that Ava and Linda can come back to Faerie anytime, but Linda and her mum refuse as there are fairer realms than Faerie and taller towers.

As Crown land, the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources administered the property as part of a vast swath of forest across the north-central part of the province.

The author's third‚Äîand her first best-seller‚Äîit was longlisted for the 2006 Man Booker Prize. The novel focuses on the stories of three friends in their early thirties, living in Manhattan in the months leading up to the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Each of the three is well- educated and privileged, but struggles with realizing the lofty expectations for individual personal and professional lives. Plot In 2001 in New York City three friends, who all showed signs of brilliance in their youth, reach their 30s without having achieved the promise they showed a decade earlier. Danielle Minkoff is the only one of her friends to hold a steady job, working as a producer for a TV program that makes documentaries. Marina Thwaite is the daughter of a revered literary critic and author, Murray Thwaite, who was offered a book contract to write about children's fashion years earlier and, having used up all her advance money and facing a hard deadline, moves back into her childhood home with her parents. Meanwhile, Julius Clarke, a brilliant and witty critic for The Village Voice, cannot sustain himself with his literary work and is forced to take temp jobs to supplement his income which, he finds demeaning. At one of his temp jobs he meets a successful, slightly younger, man called David Cohen and seduces him, eventually moving in with him and allowing himself to be kept like a housewife. He keeps Marina and Danielle away from David. Meanwhile, Danielle begins two flirtations, one with Ludovic Seeley, an Australian editor who has moved to New York City to start a literary journal called The Monitor, after Le Moniteur Universel, and another with Marina's father, Murray, who begins an email correspondence at first using her job and later concern over Marina's unemployment as reasons to keep contacting her. Marina, still hanging on to the last traces of her It-girl status, is unsettled by the arrival of her 19-year-old cousin Bootie, who has dropped out of university to pursue a program of educating himself by his own design. Bootie reveres the Thwaites and looks up to his uncle Murray, in whose footsteps he wants to follow; but Marina is dismissive, calling him \\"Fat Fredrick,\\" and finds that he has installed himself in the Thwaite home creepy. Despite this, things quickly fall in line for Bootie: Murray is impressed by both his desire to leave his small town and his desire to self-educate and offers him a salary and work as his private secretary. Through Marina, Bootie also is able to rent Julius's old apartment. Though Danielle is more attracted to Seeley, she makes the mistake of introducing him to Marina as a possible editor for his magazine and watches from the sidelines as the two begin to work together and start a relationship. Seeley also inspires Marina to begin to work on her book anew, which she decides to name The Emperor's Children Have No Clothes, inspired by something that Seeley tells her. As the possibility of being with Seeley dissolves, Danielle begins sleeping with Murray. Working as Murray's secretary, Bootie discovers that his uncle is not the high-principled man he once thought he was and discovers that he self- plagiarizes articles, blows off low-paying events for star-studded ones and is writing a secret indulgent book called How to Live. Additionally, after discovering Murray's affair with Danielle, Bootie decides to write an expos√© on Murray for The Monitor. Over the 4th of July holiday weekend, Seeley and Marina become engaged, to the annoyance of Danielle and Murray, both of whom suspect that Seeley has some ulterior motive to take down Murray. Around the same time, Marina finishes her book and gives it to Murray to read. Finding it vapid and soulless, he urges her not to publish the book, causing a rift between father and daughter. Around the same time, Bootie finishes his expos√© on Murray and gives copies to his mother, Marina and Murray. Expecting them to applaud him for his honesty, he is shocked when all three are horrified by what he has written. Making matters worse, Seeley likes the piece and wants to publish it, causing a fight between him and Marina. Bootie becomes estranged from the Thwaites. Furthermore, after David loses his job, Julius takes back his apartment, causing Bootie to move to rent a room in an apartment and begin temping downtown. Marina goes forward with publishing her book and marrying Seeley. At their wedding, Danielle asks Murray to spend an entire night with her, something he has never done, always returning home after their trysts to his wife, Annabel. Murray has a cancellation on September 10 and thus decides to spend that night with Danielle. They spend the evening together and the following morning are able to see the September 11 attacks from Danielle's apartment window. Terrified about what has happened, Murray abandons Danielle to go to Annabel. Danielle is heartbroken, realizing that though she thought of Murray as her soulmate, he has chosen Annabel over her. At the headquarters of The Monitor, Seeley realizes that his project is completely doomed as the launch was to take place that day but the attacks mean that the magazine cannot go to print, and that all the articles will seem obsolete anyway.

One year later he started with his scientific observations of comets, meteors, the solar photosphere, variable stars, the planets and occultations. He lives in Lelekovice, a village in the South Moravian Region, the Czech Republic. Hornoch makes most of his observations from a small observatory in Lelekovice with a reflector telescope. Although he uses a CCD camera, he is also good in visual estimates of star luminosity, reaching an accuracy of 0.03 magnitude (confirmed by separate photoelectric measurements). He has also been acknowledged for his numerous estimates and measurements of brightness and positions of comets and variable stars, as well as position measurements of minor planets. In 1993 he co-discovered (with Jan Kysel√Ω) new variable star ES UMa. He is a member of the Czech Astronomical Society. Since 2007 he works as a professional astronomer at the Ond≈ôejov Observatory. Novae In the summer of 2002, Hornoch took a series of pictures of the surrounding of the core of the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered his first extragalactic nova. Since that time, galaxy M31 has become his favourite place to observe; he has made 43 nova discoveries and co-discoveries in that region (as of May 2007). He also discovered two novae in the galaxy M81 in pictures taken by Czech astronomer Pavel Caga≈° with his reflector telescope on 8 and 11 April 2007. No nova discovery had been made with such a small telescope in such a distance before.

He played quarterback and halfback at Ohio State University where he was selected as an All-American in 1920. He later played professional football for the Chicago Bears (1921‚Äì1922), Columbus Tigers (1923), Cleveland Indians (1923), and Louisville Colonels (1926). He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973. Biography Stinchcomb was a native of Sycamore, Ohio. He played high school football for Fostoria High School in Fostoria, Ohio, and was named an All-Ohio halfback while playing on an undefeated football team. Stinchcomb enrolled at Ohio State University in 1916. He played for the Buckeyes as a quarterback and halfback in 1917, 1919 and 1920. Stinchcomb's biography at the College Football Hall of Fame describes him as follows: \\"Although a lightweight at 165 pounds, Stinchcomb was a halfback blitz, quick and shifty as he made his way through enemy defenses.\\" As a sophomore in 1917, Stinchcomb was selected as an All-Big Ten Conference player at the quarterback position. Though All-American Chic Harley was the veteran star of the 1917 Buckeyes team, Stinchcomb's play won him praise as a co-star of the Ohio State backfield. One newspaper wrote as follows about Stinchcomb's performance in 1917: > Stinchcomb a Star. On the campus at Ohio State they call him 'Pete,' and > although the stellar performance against Northwestern was his 'curtain' > affair they have learned to mention him in the same breath with 'Chic' > Harley. Last season when Stinchcomb was running through the varsity as a > member of the freshman eleven Ohio fans looked a year ahead and longed to > see Harley and Stinchcomb paired off as halves on the same team. Today, that > situation has come pass, and with what effect the season's record shows. At the end of the 1917 season, one newspaper wrote: \\"Harley and his teammate, Stinchcomb, of Ohio State, outstepped their rivals and made the greatest pair of backs ever seen in the Western Conference.\\" In April 1918, following the entry of the United States into World War I, Stinchcomb enlisted in the U.S. Navy and missed the 1918 football season. He played for a Cleveland Naval football team during the 1918 season. In an 83‚Äì0 win over Cornell, he ran 100 yards for a touchdown. In a 14‚Äì6 win over Camp Grant, Stinchcomb was the Navy's star, kicking two extra points and returning a punt 65 yards for a touchdown. And at the end of the 1918 season, Stinchcomb scored seven points (a touchdown and an extra point) as the Cleveland Naval Reserve team defeated the University of Pittsburgh football team, 10‚Äì9. In a profile of Stinchcomb published in November 1918, one writer observed: > The reason for such optimistic predictions is the showing Stlnchcomb has > made this season in the 'unofficial' football season all grid fans have > enjoyed. As backfleld man for the Cleveland Naval Reserve team -- in which > branch of the service Stinchcomb has been serving -- 'Pete' has romped > around opposing ends -- plunged through their lines and carried his team to > the fore ranks of military and naval football ratings. In late December 1918, Stinchcomb, described as \\"the star line-plunger on the Cleveland Naval Reserve eleven,\\" announced his plan to return to Ohio State in 1919. After the war, Stinchcomb returned to Ohio State and played for the Buckeyes football team in 1919 and 1920. He also founded the Student Bookstore at Ohio State in 1920. In 1919, he played for the first Ohio State football team to defeat the University of Michigan. Stinchcomb and fellow backfield star Chic Harley were the stars in the Buckeyes' first victory over the Wolverines. At the end of the 1919 season, Stinchcomb was selected as a first- team All-Western quarterback. With Harley's graduation, Stinchcomb was the star of Ohio State's 1920 football team. The 1920 group led by Stinchcomb became Ohio State's first undefeated football team, and at the end of the season Stinchcomb was selected as a first-team All-American. Ohio State coach John Wilce later recalled the efficiency of the two stars of his 1920 team: \\"'Workmen to Stinchcomb' was a phrase almost as common in the west as the famous 'Tinker to Evers to Chance.' Hoge Workman at quarter and Pete Stinchcomb at right half played every phase of footpall expertly but they had developed the aerial game to the last degree of efficiency. ... Stinchcomb was perhaps the outstanding star of the squad. The critics unanimously picked him for all-American halfback.\\" While traveling to Pasadena, California in December 1920 to play in the 1921 Rose Bowl, Stinchcomb announced that he would marry Anne Jane Summers of Columbus, Ohio. The two remained married for more than 50 years until Stinchcomb's death in 1973. Stinchcomb also competed for Ohio State in baseball and track and field. As a senior, he won the 1921 NCAA championship in the broad jump. Stinchcomb played several years of professional football. He played two years for George Halas's Chicago Bears (1921‚Äì1922) and also played some for the Columbus Tigers (1923), the Cleveland Indians (1923), and the Louisville Colonels (1926). He was selected as a first-team All-Pro in 1921 and 1922 and a second-team All-Pro in 1923. Stinchcomb returned to Ohio State as a backfield coach in 1935. After retiring from football, Stinchcomb served as president of Linworth Homes Inc. of Findlay, Ohio and Uhrichsville, Ohio, and as president of Eagle Creek Utility Co. of Findlay. Stinchcomb and his wife, Anne Jane, lived in Upper Arlington, Ohio for many years, but moved to Findlay, Ohio in 1968 when he became president of Linworth Homes. In 1973, Stinchcomb was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, but he died at age 78 before the induction ceremony was conducted. There is a street named after him nearby the Ohio State campus.

Composed in May 1825 and entitled Premiere Grande Sonata, it is the first of three sonatas published during the composer's lifetime, the others being D.850 and D.894. Conceived as a set, these works were composed during what was reportedly a period of relatively good health and spirits for Schubert, and are praised for their quality and ambition. This first sonata in particular marks a significant step toward the composer‚Äôs mature piano sonata style; the format and several characteristic stylistic elements continue through the last. Movements Movement I, opening bars I. Moderato A minor; Alla breve The first movement is composed in an atypical sonata form. A plaintive, somewhat ominous pianissimo unison octave phrase ornamented with a mordent opens the work, with a contrasting chordal consequent. The rhythmically similar first and second subjects of the exposition are not clearly separated structurally, a feature continued later in the ambiguous segue into the recapitulation. The atmospheric and expansive development, unusual for its time, is characterized by a sense of time dilation and wandering, and is an early example of this defining feature of Schubert‚Äôs mature works (see the developments of the late sonatas and the string quintet). The relative major C, as well as the submediant F major, play major structural and dramatic roles in this and later movements. The movement is generally quiet and tense, punctuated by dramatic climaxes and a stentorian coda. II. Andante poco moto Movement II, Theme C major; Theme and Variations - Andante poco moto The second movement comprises 5 variations on a simple 32-bar, two-section theme with elements of counterpoint and chromaticism. The variations generally undergo progressive rhythmic subdivision, with a parallel minor variation followed by a key change that prepares a conclusive return to the tonic for the final variation. This format, which avoids tonal monotony and produces a sense of departure and return, is identical to that of Schubert's Impromptu D935 no.3 (even including key relationships), and is typical of late classical works in general. The first variation introduces an eliding chromatic figuration that accompanies the otherwise largely unaltered theme. The second variation is an energetic, liberally ornamented scherzando with ongoing chromatic and minor touches. The bleak, dramatic third variation is in the parallel minor, with a remarkable use of dissonance and a focus on the minor second Db. This note prepares the key change to the submediant Ab major in variation four, a virtuosic run of fast 32nd notes that makes heavy use of chromaticism and idiomatic pianistic figurations. The final variation, back in C major, is comparatively simple, with repeated chords in eighth note triplets and a pastoral quality. It retains the focus on Db from the previous variation, as well as minor key sections, tying together the movement. The piece ends with a brief coda and a plagal cadence. In most printed versions, the first variation is not exact: 4 measures (corresponding to m. 20-23 of the theme) are missing after measure 43. This discrepancy was first pointed out by Paul Badura-Skoda. (Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik 119, 1958 p. 635-43). The Wiener Urtext edition provides an emendation with the note: \\"Passage in smaller print - editor's suggested insertion - totally missing in [First Edition], probably due to engraver's error when changing to new page. Inconceivable that Schubert would deliberately omit four measures here since there is complete conformity in the other variations.\\" (Schubert: S√§mtliche Klaviersonaten Band 2 (Tirimo), p. 241.) The First Edition is the primary source since the autograph itself is lost. Scherzo III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace - Trio: Un poco pi√π lento A minor/major, Trio in F major; Allegro vivace In compound ternary form, the shadowy, mercurial scherzo plays off of elements of the first movement (in particular the V-I-V-I chord sequence from the second theme), and synthesizes, reinforces, and summarizes harmonic and thematic relationships from throughout the sonata, an approach Schubert used in the scherzi in his mature piano sonatas. Odd phrase lengths, subito effects, and unprepared distant modulations give the scherzo a quirky character. The pastoral F major trio, a gently rocking interlude with soft dynamics, is in stark contrast. Finale IV. Rondo: Allegro vivace A minor; Rondo - Allegro vivace This movement is in sonata rondo form with foreshortened recapitulation. The toccata-like rondo theme, like the allegro and scherzo themes, begins in A minor and soon modulates to C major. The V-I- V-I chord sequence featured in the first and third movements again appears prominently in the intervening episodes. The movement is economical, especially for a Schubert finale, and ends briskly with an accelerando closing section.

Rowe Price, a Baltimore-based global asset management firm. Football For high school, Stromberg attended Loyola Blakefield, a Catholic college preparatory school for boys located in Towson, Maryland near Baltimore. He then attended Johns Hopkins University, earning a B.A. in 1982. While at Hopkins, he became one of Johns Hopkins Blue Jays' most decorated athletes of all time, setting long- standing records for both the baseball and football teams. His records for baseball included record runs scored and stolen bases, and his many accomplishments on the football team made him \\"arguably the best football player in Johns Hopkins history.\\" Beyond Hopkins, he is considered to be one of the best wide receivers in NCAA Division III history as the holder of six national and thirteen school records. Stromberg was inducted into the Johns Hopkins Hall of Fame and then the College Football Hall of Fame in 2004, and was, as of 2017, the only Hopkins football player to be inducted there. Hopkins constructed a new baseball field and athletic facilities named Stromberg Stadium in 2014 in his honor. After graduation, Stromberg signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles, played a few preseason games before pulling a hamstring, and was ultimately cut before the 1982 season began. Career Stromberg earned an MBA from Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business and the CFA designation before becoming an equity analyst at T. Rowe Price, a Baltimore-based global asset management firm, in 1987. He remained an analyst until 1992, at which point he took over management of the Dividend Growth Fund. Then, from 2000 to 2006, he was portfolio manager of another fund. He served the next three years as the head of the firm's U.S.-based equity operations before becoming the head of equity across the firm in 2009. Stromberg took over for James A. C. Kennedy as President and CEO of T. Rowe Price on January 1, 2016, at which point Stromberg had been with the firm for nearly thirty years. As president of the firm, Stromberg helped found the Greater Washington Partnership, \\"a group of chief executives and business leaders from the Baltimore-Washington area\\" aiming to improve its economy and infrastructure.

For many years, 1917 Georgia Tech was considered the greatest football team the South ever produced. Strupper starred as part of a renowned backfield including also Joe Guyon, Judy Harlan, and Al Hill. Strupper and teammate Walker Carpenter were the first players from the Deep South selected for an All-America first team. Sportswriter Morgan Blake called Strupper \\"probably the greatest running half- back the South has known.\\" Bernie McCarty writes \\"Strupper ranks among the greatest broken-field gallopers in Southern football history. And he caught and threw passes, returned kicks, blocked well, punted and played a bang-up defensive game.\\" He was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972 and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1974. Early years Strupper was born in Columbus, Georgia, in 1896. His parents, G. Everett Strupper, Sr. (born 1872), and Bessie H.

Stupper attended Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia. He was the star of the school's football team in 1913; and is a member of the school's sports hall of fame. Georgia Tech Strupper enrolled at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta in 1914. During his freshman year, Strupper became a member of the Georgia Phi chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.Georgia School of Technology \\"Blue Print,\\" 1918. He was a multi-sport athlete competing for Georgia Tech in basketball, football, and track and field. In 1914, Strupper played for the freshman football team at Georgia Tech. He then played halfback for Georgia Tech's varsity football teams under head coach John Heisman from 1915 to 1917. Strupper was deaf, and because of his deafness, he called the signals instead of the team's quarterback. Strupper was a small man, with his height being stated in varying accounts to be between five-feet seven inches and five-feet, ten inches. His coach John Heisman later wrote that Strupper was \\"but 5 feet 7 inches in height, weighed only 148 pounds stripped.\\" He was sometimes known as \\"little Everett Strupper.\\" Georgia Tech never lost a game in which Strupper played, compiling three consecutive undefeated seasons from 1915 to 1917. During Strupper's three years playing for Georgia Tech, the team compiled a record of 24‚Äì0‚Äì2. Only two teams managed a tie ‚Äì the University of Georgia in 1915 and Washington & Lee in 1916. In those 26 games, Georgia Tech outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61. Georgia Tech coach John Heisman later described Strupper as follows: > \\"Everett Strupper was a small package of condensed lightning when you turned > him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere in the > neighborhood of the enemy's goal line. He was small, but he was put together > like a high-powered motor. His arms and legs did just what his mind told > them to do, and, believe me, his mind worked faster than Ty Cobb's when he's > running the bases. Dodging and twisting, stiff-arming and hipping, he'd run > the gauntlet of men big enough, you'd think, to pick him up and spank him, > and most of the time, too, he'd get away from them, try as hard as they > would.\\" Strupper from Georgia Tech archives Heisman also said of Strupper \\"Were I compelled to risk my head on what one absolutely unaided gridster might accomplish, football under arm and facing eleven ferocious opponents, I would rather choose and chance this man on how he might come through the gauntlet than any ball carrier I have ever seen in action.\\" Heisman recalled that, when Strupper first arrived from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman could not imagine Strupper playing on the football team: \\"Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't be able to get the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays.\\" Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: \\"He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball.\\" He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869‚Äì1919 era team. 1915 season In his sophomore year, Strupper proved to be an all-around athlete. As Heisman told it, Strupper \\"was a star baseball player, a crack at basketball and the best sprint man we had in the school.\\" Heisman recalled that, despite his small stature, Strupper had a powerful body: \\"Stripped down in the dressing rooms Everett was a sight to behold. There never was a better set up lad than he; he was a regular Apollo, beautifully muscled and built and coordinating rhythmically in every movement.\\" When Strupper tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback would shout the signals every time Strupper was to carry the ball. Realizing the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman, \\"Coach, those loud signals are absolutely unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to teach me lip-reading.\\" Strupper first starred in a game against Transylvania, scoring four touchdowns. He was injured the next week against LSU, and blamed LSU's Phillip Cooper. Tech closed what was then the greatest season in its history with a 7‚Äì0 defeat of the Auburn Plainsmen. To begin the second quarter, Strupper had two key plays, the last of which was the game-deciding touchdown. First he made 20 yards around with a pass from Froggie MorrisonBlue Print, 1916 before being forced out of bounds. Next was the 19-yard touchdown. Strupper started around left end, then cut back into the center of the field, away from his blockers. He juked and eluded \\"every man on the Auburn team.\\" On the last move Strupper faked right and then dove left underneath the outstretched arms of Baby Taylor into the endzone. At the end of the 1915 season, Strupper received two selections from a composite All- Southern eleven selected by ten sports writers and coaches, including those from Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Birmingham, Chattanooga, and New Orleans. 1916 season Ev Strupper In 1916, Strupper had a 92-yard punt return for a touchdown on opening day against Mercer.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/71stats.pdf The next week, Strupper led Georgia Tech in a 222‚Äì0 victory over Cumberland College, \\"the most lopsided game in football history.\\" The score (compiled on 32 touchdowns and 30 extra points) broke the old record of a 153‚Äì0 set by the University of Michigan in 1912. Strupper scored eight touchdowns in the game, six rushing and two on punt returns. One historic account of the 1916 Cumberland game described Strupper as the \\"lord high executioner\\": > \\"There were many executioners that crisp early-fall Saturday. Halfback G.E. > Strupper scored from 20 yards out on Tech's first offensive play and went on > to be lord high executioner with eight touchdowns and a conversion for a > total of 49 points.\\" In the first quarter alone, Strupper scored four touchdowns on runs of 20, 10, 60, and 45 yards. Strupper chose to allow others to share in the scoring. With a 42‚Äì0 lead midway through the first quarter, Strupper broke clear and could have scored easily, but he intentionally grounded the ball at the one-yard line to allow Georgia Tech tackle J. Cantey Alexander to score the first touchdown of his career. A teammate later recalled the play as follows: > \\"Strupper swapped positions with Alexander ... The team didn't want to make > it too easy for Cantey, though. The other boys wouldn't block for him or > help in any way. As soon as the ball was snapped, they ran away from the > line and out of the play completely. Leaving poor Cantey to go it alone. > Finally, on fourth down, a bruised and weary Alexander managed to get the > ball across while his teammates howled with laughter.\\" Strupper (far left, with ball) rushing v. Penn. The game was eventually halted after just 44 minutes of play. It was said only one newspaper in all of the South neglected to have Strupper on its All-Southern team for 1916. He ranked third in the nation in scoring, including 16 touchdowns. 1917 season Strupper also played on the 1917 team then considered the greatest the South ever produced, including one of the greatest backfields. According to the Times-Picayune, \\"Strupper, Guyon, Hill, and Harlan form a backfield with no superiors and few equals in football history\\". Tech gave Vanderbilt its worst loss in school history 83‚Äì0. \\"It was not until 1917 that a Southern team really avenged long-time torment at McGugin's hands. And it took one of history's top backfields‚ÄìJoe Guyon, Ev Strupper, Al Hill, and Judy Harlan of Georgia Tech‚Äìto do it,\\" writes Edwin Pope. The team also defeated the University of Pennsylvania, then one of the Eastern powers, 41‚Äì0. It was called by one writer \\"Strupper's finest hour.\\" In a 98‚Äì0 win over the Carlisle Indians in 1917, Strupper drew praise for his performance. The Atlanta Journal wrote: > \\"Everett Strupper played like a veritable demon. At one time four Carlisle > men pounced on him from all directions, and yet through some superhuman > witchery he broke loose and dashed 10 yards further. On another occasion he > attempted a wide end run, found that he was completely blocked, then > suddenly whirled and ran the other way, gaining something like 25 yards > before he was downed.\\" Tech's 1917 backfield; left to right: Strupper, Harlan, Guyon, and Hill Strupper scored five touchdowns against Carlisle, including a 32-yard fumble return for a touchdown. And in a 68‚Äì7 win over rival Auburn, Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run that drew the following praise from the Atlanta Journal: > \\"It was not the length of the run that featured it was the brilliance of it. > After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two > secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from them, only to face > the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from different angles. > Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running > between them and dashing on to a touchdown.\\" Remarkably, two Georgia Tech players led the country in touchdowns for the 1917 season. Quarterback Albert Hill was first with 23 touchdowns, and Strupper was second with 20 touchdowns. Strupper rushed for some 1,150 yards on a little over 100 carries. Strupper has been recognized as a consensus first-team player on the 1917 College Football All-America Team, having received first-team honors from Frank Menke Syndicate,ESPN College Football Encyclopedia, p. 1150 Paul Purman, and Dick Jemison of the Atlanta Constitution.Spalding's Football Guide Strupper and team captain Walker Carpenter were the first players from the Deep South selected for an All- America first team.

Army on August 28, 1918, and was assigned to the First Replacement Regiment at Camp Gordon in Augusta, Georgia. In October 1918, Strupper transferred to Camp Hancock and promoted to the rank of sergeant. He played football for Camp Gordon and Camp Hancock teams. In November 1918, Camp Gordon played a game in Strupper's home town of Columbus, Georgia, and the locals held \\"Strupper Day\\" in his honor. In a game for Camp Gordon on December 7, 1918, he had two runs of 80 yards and scored four touchdowns. At the end of the season, he was picked as a second-team halfback on Walter Camp's All-America service team. The war ended in November 1918, and Strupper was discharged from the Army on December 20, 1918, as part of the post-war demobilization.Georgia World War I Service Card for George E.

Although there are competing stories as to the origin of the Red Elephant mascot for the University of Alabama, some sources have cited a story written by Strupper about an October 1930 football game between Alabama and Mississippi. Strupper wrote: \\"At the end of the quarter, the earth started to tremble, there was a distant rumble that continued to grow. Some excited fan in the stands bellowed, 'Hold your horses, the elephants are coming,' and out stamped this Alabama varsity.\\" By 1934, he was working as a solicitor for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.

The Future was one of the largest student-run newspapers in the United States, with a circulation of 14,000 and readership of over 30,000. It was a member of the USA Today network. The paper printed every Thursday during the fall, spring, and summer semesters. The Future was founded as the university's official newspaper shortly after it opened in 1968. The Future has been financially and editorially independent from the university since 1992. The paper was purchased by Florida Today, which is owned by Gannett, in 2007.The Chronicle of Higher Education Only students from UCF were allowed to be employed by the paper. In addition, the paper gave priority to enrolled college students for work in the editorial department, to be an advertising representative or serve as an intern. The Future was distributed free on UCF's campuses, as well as around Orlando and Oviedo. The paper contained a mix of campus and local news coverage, as well as national and international stories from wire services. It also contained a sports section, entertainment section, and an opinion section. The Future was printed in a tabloid format, similar to that of Boston Herald and the Daily Mail. On July 21, 2016, Gannett announced it was shutting down the newspaper, with its final issue being printed on August 4. History=Early years The Future was in publication since the first day of class held at the Orlando campus in 1968. The name of The Future was derived from the original name of the University of Central Florida, Florida Technological University (FuTUre). The words Central Florida were added after the school changed its name to the University of Central Florida in 1978. The Future held its offices in the UCF Library just as many other organizations did in the early years of the university's history. When the University first opened, students had no choice for the mascot. The Citronaut was the unofficial mascot for FTU's first year, appearing on only official publications, like the cover of the 1968‚Äì69 student handbook. After a year, students petitioned the student government for a new mascot. In response, The Future published what its staffers felt were important criteria for a new mascot: an animal that flew, as the school motto is \\"Reach for the Stars\\", it should also be virtuous, include the school colors of black and gold, and it should be something unique because \\"FTU stressed the importance of individuality.\\" Shortly thereafter, a student health center nurse, Judy Hines, followed the criteria and came up with Vincent the Vulture. This mascot stuck for a year before the school administration and students decided on a new official mascot, \\"Knights of the Pegasus.\\" Independence In 1993, The Future was made independent of UCF by being spun off as an independent company, Knight Newspapers, Inc. At the time, the company also held ownership of the Seminole Chronicle. In February 2007, Florida Today purchased Knight Newspapers, Inc. which included the Central Florida Future. Florida Today is owned by Gannett, which made The Future the second student-run university paper to be purchased by Gannett, the first being the FSView & Florida Flambeau of Florida State University. Subsequent to the sale, offices moved to the Central Florida Research Park, which is located directly south of UCF's main campus. After purchasing The Future, Gannett moved three other products within the same office as The Future, including The Seminole Chronicle, a weekly newspaper covering Seminole County, Moms Like Me, a monthly magazine for mothers, and Saves, a coupon booklet packaged with The Future. Recent history In early 2016, The Future moved its headquarters to an office building at the intersection of University Boulevard and Rouse Road, a mile from UCF. For its June 23, 2016 issue, The Future dedicated its entire issue to coverage of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Circulation As late as 2013, The Future printed 20,000 copies for each issue during the fall and spring semesters, and distributed the papers throughout campus and in the surrounding area through the use of more than 200 newspaper boxes.CFFrate0708.qxd For the fall 2009 semester, budget cuts and the economic recession forced the paper to cut printing from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and switch to Monday and Thursday publishing for all semesters. In August 2014, the paper announced that it would become a weekly publication, with release every Thursday, and that production would shift from the broadsheet to tabloid format.\\"Welcome to the future of the Future\\" Central Florida Future. 2014-08-13 The Future was an affiliate of UWIRE, a wire service produced by student journalists at more than 800 colleges and universities across the United States, giving the paper access to news, sports, features, entertainment, and opinion articles by the other members.

However, Ginny refuses to marry unless her older sister, the hard-to-please Angelica (Dorothy Christy) marries first as she's afraid that Angelica will become an old maid. Angelica, in turn, finds every man she knows too dull and predictable, not wild and exciting, so prefers to stay single. One day, Jeff hits mild-mannered and timid Reggie Irving (played by Keaton) with his car and brings him to the Embrey mansion to recuperate. Angelica thinks that Reggie's handsome, so Jeff lies, telling her that he's a notorious, wealthy playboy chased away from Europe's playgrounds. Angelica's intrigued, particularly when different women, hired by Jeff, visit Reggie and fight over him. Reggie's alarmed by this turn of events, as he thinks that Angelica's beautiful, but is inexperienced with wooing women. He tries to flee, but is captured and re-concussed by the Embrey groundskeepers at Jeff's direction. Angelica continues nursing him, falling in love. Worried that Angelica will find Reggie dull, Jeff asks Polly (Charlotte Greenwood), a society journalist, to write rumors about him.

Nita becomes frightened that she is at an hotel with a terrible man and hides in the bedroom, despite his pleading from the parlor that Angelica needs to catch them together. Then, Polly bursts into the suite and comically attempts to teach him to woo. Sadly, Reggie's a limp fish, lacking passion. The Embreys and Fred arrive, Fred shooting at Reggie for running away with Nita. Polly collapses, and everyone flees, shouting, \\"Murder!\\" with Fred pulling Nita out of the room before locking Reggie in the parlor with the \\"body.\\" He hides her in a closet before the police arrive. When the they find her, Polly wakes from her faint, and Reggie escapes. Everyone runs around the hotel, becoming mixed up, and Reggie and Angelica end back in his hotel suite together.

He was active in opposing the presence of the Latter Day Saints in Hancock County, Illinois, during the 1840s. He is one of five defendants who were tried and acquitted of the 1844 murder of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. In the early 1830s, Williams, his wife (Mary \\"Polly\\" Reid), and three sons John Reid Williams, Henry Clay Williams and Rice Williams moved from Kentucky to Hancock County, Illinois. Southeast of Warsaw, in Green Plains, Williams became a farmer and a cooper. He also occasionally worked as a Baptist minister. Williams served as a county commissioner to establish roads. In 1835, he was commissioned a captain in the 59th Regiment of the Illinois militia and in 1840 was commissioned colonel and commanding officer of the same regiment. Williams was a veteran of the War of 1812, and was the son of a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who served in Virginia. When Latter Day Saints began settling in Hancock County in the late 1830s and early 1840s, Williams became a fierce opponent of their presence. In 1843, Williams led a militia that captured Mormon Daniel Avery and his son and threatened them with guns and knives before releasing them in Missouri.Joseph Smith, B. H. Roberts (ed.), History of the Church, 6:99‚Äì100, 108‚Äì10, 145‚Äì48. Murder trial After Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed at Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, Williams was accused of having ordered his 59th Regiment to take part in the storming of the jail. At trial, Williams and four other defendantsThomas C. Sharp, Mark Aldrich, Jacob C. Davis and William N. Grover. were acquitted of the murders by a jury. According to \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickman, Williams told him that because the Mormons \\"ruled the county [and] elected whom they pleased ... the old settlers had no chance\\". Killing the Smiths, Williams claimed, \\"was the only way they could get rid of them.\\"Bill Hickman (1872). Brigham's Destroying Angel (New York: George A. Crofutt), p. 39. Williams served as postmaster of Green Plains, Illinois, after his acquittal. He died of a stroke on November 20, 1860, at his farm in Green Plains. Previously a member of the Whig Party, Williams joined the Republican Party before his death. NotesReferences *Dallin H. Oaks and Marvin S. Hill (1975).

This episode first aired in the United States on Sunday, August 12, 2007. Plot synopsis At a band meeting, Murray has some really good news: a gig in Central Park. Since they will, in Murray's opinion, need to be at the top of their game, he has organised a warm-up tour for them. When Bret asks how they can afford to go on tour, Murray says he has dipped into the band's \\"emergency fund\\". He flashes an envelope of cash but won't tell them where he got the money. In the car on the way to their first gig, Murray gets a call from his wife Shelley. They had been separated but are back together now. Bret learns from his phone conversation that the 'emergency fund' came from their joint cheque account, and that Murray hadn't told his wife that he had taken it to use for the tour. They also find out that Mel and Doug have been following their car. The first gig of the tour turns out to be in dark lounge of a hotel next to LaGuardia Airport. After the gig, Murray gives the boys a per diem but is annoyed when he discovers they have spent all the money on leather suits. He intended the \\"per diem\\" to last all week. They try to give Murray a gift they had bought for him, but an annoyed Murray refuses without looking at it. Up in the hotel room, Jemaine is trying to watch TV; however, Bret has to hold it in the air in order to get a decent reception. When his arms tire, he puts the TV down on the window sill, but it falls out the window. This results in Murray having to pay for a new TV out of the tour funds. Later at the next gig in Passaic, Jemaine clumsily damages a club amplifier, leaving Murray further out of pocket. When they turn up at their next gig, they find their reputation for damaging equipment has preceded them and the club owner turns them away. That night at the bar, Bret and Jemaine are invited to sit with the members of the North Jersey University Women's Water Polo team. After finding out they are in a band, the women ask for their autographs and suggest partying in the boys' room. Bret and Jemaine head upstairs first and, on the way up to their room, sing \\"Mermaid\\". The guys wait all night, with Murray banished to sleep in the bathroom, but the women do not show up. The next morning, they discover that the team has used their autographs and room number to charge a large bar bill to the band's room. To make things worse, Brett fails to put the parking brake on in Murray's car after parking it, causing it to slide into a swimming pool. A furious Murray quits as manager and storms off to walk home. Left without a way home, Bret and Jemaine are forced to ask Mel and Doug for a lift. When they catch up with Murray on the highway, they successfully manage to make up with him by giving him the gift they had bought for him earlier. It turns out to be a leather suit just like theirs. The happy threesome head for their final gig in 'Central Park'. The band discovers, however, that Murray has misled them. The gig turns out to be in \\"a central park\\" in Newark. The concert is titled Newark Summer Jam '07. Over the end credits, we see Murray on his mobile phone trying to explain to his boss why he has been absent from work all week. Notes * Bret reveals his 'secret' last name \\\\- McClegnie - a scrambled version of the actor's real name. * We learn that the name of Murray's wife is Shelley. * Becky of the water polo team has the same trouble with Bret's first name that Coco does in the \\"Bret Gives Up The Dream\\" episode. * The name of the band is misspelt on the information board at the gig in the lounge of a hotel at LaGuardia Airport. It is \\"Flight of the Concordes.\\" Songs The following songs are featured in this episode:  \\"Mermaid\\"  There was only one full song in this episode, \\"Mermaid\\"Track listing of Folk the World Tour album SmokeCDs (a.k.a. MermaidsLyrics from Episode 9: \\"What Goes on Tour\\". Official HBO Website). The boys imagine the girls of the water polo team are mermaids and sing an ode to the mythical creatures in a lounge act vocal style.  Other songs  Bret and Jemaine play a fragment of \\"Rock the Party\\" at the gig in the hotel lounge. In the park at the end of the episode, when Murray is on the phone, we can see the boys on stage in the background playing the intro music for \\"Robots\\". Cultural references The club owner that turns the band away is played by Kate Pierson, founder and lead singer of The B-52's. When blaming Jemaine for dropping the TV out the window, Murray likens him to Keith Moon, drummer for The Who and notorious destroyer of hotel rooms. There is also a famous, possibly apocryphal, tale where Moon drove a car into a swimming pool -- as Bret ends up doing later in the episode. Midway through the episode, during a montage of tour scenes, a piano piece can be heard playing that is almost identical to the piano intro to the M√∂tley Cr√ºe song \\"Home Sweet Home\\". The music video for \\"Home Sweet Home\\" also features scenes of a band on tour.Motley Crue - Home Sweet Home (YouTube) Filming locations * LaGuardia Airport Hotel References Category:Flight of the Conchords episodes Category:2007 American television episodes ","title":"What Goes on Tour"},{"id":"12744669","text":"City Mall was a shopping mall located in Eroii Revolutiei square, Bucharest, Romania.

History The TXT-1 was released originally between 2000 and 2002, proving very popular. Tamiya discontinued the truck in July 2012. It was created to compete with the Traxxas T-Maxx/E-Maxx that was dominating the hobby. It has also been used as the basis for robot systems.Multi-robot systems From swarms to intelligent automata, Volume 3 By Lynne E Parker, Frank E Schneider, Alan C Schultz Features The most significant and most obvious feature of the TXT-1 over most other available RC monster trucks is the twin vertical plate chassis and, more important, the straight axle suspension system. The former is specified as 6mm machined aluminum plate with extensive milling to reduce weight without critically reducing rigidity. Several tubular aluminum braces improve the structure, while the closed plastic transmission housing is a stressed member. Two formed plastic plates serve to further improve rigidity while providing ample space for mounting electronic components. The TXT-1 exhibits a straight- axle suspension system damped via silicone-filled shocks, the latter a departure from friction shocks used on the Clod Buster. Of note is the fixed- ratio cantilever arrangement actuating the shocks which lengthens the effective range through which the shocks travel, increasing suspension articulation. By design the vehicle is somewhat prone to stability-degrading torque steer and body roll. The truck features zip-ties retaining metal anti- sway bars which significantly improve stability. Motor The truck, available only as a kit, comes equipped with twin 540-J size sealed endbell stock motors wired in parallel when using the standard mechanical speed control. The motors feed power through a closed gear-reduction transmission terminating in a single dual-end output shaft which subsequently turn metal telescoping driveshafts running to each axle. The two axles feature the additional bracing and updated gear arrangement and specifications of the Juggernaut 2 truck which improve durability and lifespan while reducing the chance of gear misalignment under large torque loads. The 12mm hex at the end of each axle shaft keys into a widened 5-hole hub akin to the Clod Buster hub to increase track width. Main stress-bearing internal gear shafts in the transmission and axles are supported by metal shielded bearings, while the rest of the gears in the truck spin on metal bushings. The truck may also see use with advancing brushless motor and lithium polymer battery technology for high-power -speed combinations. While the truck may travel at a maximum speed of 7 mph when paired with a 7.2V battery or less than 4 mph in a high-torque crawling setup, a power and speed oriented arrangement may endow the TXT-1 with consistent 40 mph top speeds. However, the torque-roll and -steer prone chassis requires suspension and steering modifications to ensure these runs are truly consistent and manageable. The lower bumper brackets feature mounting stand-offs for a steering servo on both the front and rear axle, allowing for either a typical front-steering arrangement or a full four-wheel steering setup. Tyres The truck's chevron-style tires are similar to those included with the Clod Buster, yet are minutely changed in molding; the wheels are carryovers from the Juggernaut, except for enlarged circular pegs for keying into the widened hubs for improved durability. Control The servo- actuated three step mechanical speed control features a resistor with a metal mounting bracket for heat dissipation, and is wired for a single 7.2V battery pack. A transmitter, receiver, and a minimum of one servo for steering and one servo for throttle are required to complete the truck. An enticing feature is Tamiya includes two bodies: one is pre-painted as represented on the box art, while the second is left clear with an overspray film for custom painting schemes. Unfortunately, only one set of decals is included. Axle and chassis arrangement As the truck features a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire contact patches to the ground. As an aside, the wide gear contact patches and durable axle construction make the TXT-1 a very durable platform for either high-torque crawling applications or overall high-power brushed or brushless applications. The truck performs very well with no modifications required on a variety of surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce motor shaft-mounted pinion gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an external gear reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify caster angles and distances between axles and the chassis.

By January 1905, 150 students attended. It was founded by a group of northern abolitionists and Beaufort citizens. The school's mission was to instruct African American students in better cultivation of land, care of stock and manner of living. The school offered instruction in carpentry, bricklaying, printing and other trades. Courses for girls included cooking, sewing, nursing, and homemaking. By 1920 The Port Royal Agricultural School became the Beaufort County Training School, but it was still known as The Shanklin School by area residents. With public and private funds it was able to meet the need for African American teachers, and was known as a teacher's training site. The school maintained of land, as well as two barns, two dormitories, a power plant, equipment and an endowment of around $11,000. Today, the school is found at 121 Morrall Drive.

Set in New York, the story introduced the detective genius Nero Wolfe (Edward Arnold) and his assistant Archie Goodwin (Lionel Stander). The partnership endured through 33 novels and 39 short stories written by Stout, but continued in only one more film for Columbia Pictures. Wolfe's client is portrayed by Rita Hayworth, then billed as Rita Cansino, in an early performance. The titles of the film begin with the November 1934 issue of The American Magazine ‚Äî in which the abridged version of Fer-de-Lance appeared ‚Äî lying on a table. The magazine is taken from the table and opened to an illustrated spread that reads, \\"Edward Arnold in Meet Nero Wolfe.\\" Plot At the West Hills Golf Club in Westchester, E.J. Kimball (Walter Kingsford) and his son Manuel (Russell Hardie) are welcomed into the party of elderly Professor Barstow (Boyd Irwin Sr.) and his prospective son-in-law Claude Roberts (Victor Jory). Barstow sends his caddy back to the clubhouse to fetch his visor, and finds himself without his clubs when it is his turn to tee off. The elder Kimball loans his driver to Barstow. Immediately after hitting his drive, Barstow flinches. \\"A mosquito bit me just as I hit the ball,\\" he complains with good humor. \\"Too bad,\\" Kimball replies sympathetically, taking the club from Barstow and making his own drive. As the foursome sets out on the course, Barstow is stricken and succumbs quickly to an apparent heart attack. At the New York brownstone of Nero Wolfe (Edward Arnold), Marie Maringola (Rita Hayworth) offers the sedentary detective genius $50 to find her brother. Although he is an expert metal worker, Carlo Maringola had such trouble finding work in America that he planned to return to the old country. On the eve of his departure Carlo told his sister that he could stay in America after all ‚Äî he got a job. They had arranged a celebration but Carlo never came. He disappeared. Wolfe takes Maria's case and sends his confidential assistant Archie Goodwin (Lionel Stander) to investigate at Carlo's apartment house. Archie returns to the brownstone with evidence that suggests that Carlo will never be found alive ‚Äî and that his death is linked to the death of Professor Barstow. Wolfe theorizes that Barstow was killed by a specially constructed golf club, one that was converted by Carlo into an air rifle that propelled a poisoned needle into his midsection when he struck the ball. His theory is borne out by an autopsy of Barstow, and the discovery of Carlo's body. Solving the murder of Professor Barstow will be a far more lucrative endeavor, Wolfe is pleased to learn: a $50,000 reward has been offered. But interviews with Barstow's daughter (Joan Perry), his widow (Nana Bryant) and his doctor (Frank Conroy), do little to advance the investigation. Far more helpful is a luncheon for the four boys who caddied for Professor Barstow's foursome. Hearing their accounts, Wolfe concludes that the intended murder victim had been E.J. Kimball, not Barstow. Kimball dismisses the notion that his life is in danger until he is informed that his car has been wrecked and his chauffeur is dead ‚Äî killed by a fer-de- lance, a South American snake that is probably the most poisonous in the world. The autopsies of Professor Barstow and Carlo Maringola reveal that they too were poisoned, by the venom of the fer-de-lance. Convinced that his life is in deadly peril, Kimball pleads for Wolfe's help. After E.J. Kimball tells him about his sensational past in South America, Wolfe concludes that at least six people had reason to wish him dead ‚Äî and that the Barstow family is not above suspicion. Wolfe assigns Archie to move in with Kimball and his son, to watch over the old man. After a long game of Monopoly on the Kimballs' terrace that evening, the three men rise to go in to dinner ‚Äî and shots are fired. The attack causes Wolfe to summon all of the principals to the brownstone. They are to spend the night, and they will stay as long as necessary. The next evening a deadly parcel arrives, addressed to Wolfe. The killer has Wolfe in his sights ‚Äî and Wolfe knows he has the killer under his roof.

Instead Edward Arnold got it,\\" reported John McAleer in Rex Stout: A Biography (1977). \\"Columbia's idea was to keep Arnold busy with low-cost Wolfe films between features. Two films presently were made by Columbia, Meet Nero Wolfe (Fer-de-Lance) and The League of Frightened Men. Connolly did portray Wolfe in the latter film, after Arnold decided he did not want to become identified in the public mind with one part. Lionel Stander portrayed Archie Goodwin. Stander was a capable actor but, as Archie, Rex thought he had been miscast.\\"McAleer, John, Rex Stout: A Biography; 1977, Little Brown and Company ; pp. 254‚Äì255 Meet Nero Wolfe was the second film directed by Herbert Biberman (1900‚Äì1971), a director rooted in the theater who became best known as one of the Hollywood Ten. \\"Fresh from the theater, Biberman blocked shots instead of composing them,\\" wrote Bernard F. Dick in Radical Innocence: A Critical Study of the Hollywood Ten (1989): :Biberman opened up the action a bit, but the plot, based on Stout's Fer-de- Lance (1934), defeated him. He simply did not understand the medium; the cast reacts as it would on stage, but in film a stage reaction is overacting. Apart from some filmic touches ‚Äî swish pans, dissolves, wipes, and an eerie shot of a dead man's hand clutching a newspaper clipping that another hand reaches down to retrieve ‚Äî Meet Nero Wolfe is like a West End melodrama aimed at the tourist trade ‚Äî slick, but so ephemeral that two days later the plot has vanished from the memory.Dick, Bernard F., Radical Innocence: A Critical Study of the Hollywood Ten; 1989, The University Press of Kentucky; Hardcover , pp. 72‚Äì73 The film's greatest departure from the original story is the creation of Mazie Gray, who can indeed call herself Mrs. Archie Goodwin at the end of Meet Nero Wolfe. The decidedly un-Wolfean character is played by Dennie Moore, memorable for her performance as Olga the gossipy manicurist in the 1939 film, The Women. Reception \\"A most comforting sort of detective for these humid days is Nero Wolfe, a sedentary sleuth given to drinking great quantities of homemade beer in his cool, shade-drawn brownstone and solving murder mysteries therefrom by means of remote control,\\" wrote The New York Times (July 16, 1936): :Mr. Wolfe is, of course, the rotund Edward Arnold, whose characterization of Rex Stout's fairly recent fictional figure presages brisk competition for such current screen master minds as Philo Vance and Perry Mason, both in matters of deduction as well as esthetically. Where Mr. Vance, for example, collects old chrysoprase and what not, Nero Wolfe grows orchids. Mr. Wolfe sets a precedent, too, in achieving something that seems not to have occurred to the other ratiocinators of the cinema. He collects huge fees. \\"Its hero, less dashing than Philo Vance and less whimsical than Charlie Chan, but more mercenary than either, will be a highly acceptable addition to the screen's growing corps of private operatives,\\" wrote Time (July 27, 1936). \\"The comedy and the guessing elements have been deftly mixed, the well-knit narrative precludes any drooping in interest and the cast disports itself in crack whodunit fashion,\\" wrote Variety (July 22, 1936): :In bringing the Rex Stout figment to life Arnold has contributed lots more than girth and a capacity for beer guzzling. His Nero Wolfe jells suavely with the imagination and makes a piquant example of personality conception. For seven years this corpulent sleuth, with a craving for nothing but good food and ease, has not ventured from his home. When he isn't unraveling a crime for the cash it will bring him, he gravitates between two hobbies, bottle tilting and orchid growing. :Task of digging up evidence and following out leads for Wolfe on the outside falls to Lionel Stander. It's a typical mugg role for Stander but the performance he turns in pegs him as an important entertainment factor in the film. In 2002 Scarlet Street magazine revisited Meet Nero Wolfe ‚Äî little seen in the years after its release ‚Äî and found it neither the travesty it is sometimes thought to be, nor a faithful recreation of the world of Nero Wolfe. :Is it absurd and a \\"betrayal\\" of Stout to make Wolfe's orchid room a kind of greenhouse offshoot to his office? Of course, it is, but it's also a clever device that keeps the orchid-growing obsession in the action without breaking from the fairly complicated plot. Other departures ‚Äî such as transforming chef Fritz Brenner into the Swedish Olaf ... are less explicable. ... :What goes wrong ‚Äî at least from a purist's standpoint ‚Äî is the decision to portray Wolfe as a far too jolly character. This is odd in itself, since Arnold was rarely an actor who specialized in projecting good humor. :Judging the film as a film and dismissing questions of fidelity to the source material, Meet Nero Wolfe is an above average minor A picture, a solid mystery, and unfailingly entertaining. Certain things ‚Äî such as a sequence involving Archie playing the then new game of Monopoly ‚Äî have a nice time capsule quality that has nothing to do with the Wolfe books, but have a value all their own. No, at bottom, it's not Rex Stout's Nero and Archie, but it's a well-developed mystery (thanks to Stout's plot) with compensations all its own ‚Äî and an interesting piece of Wolfeana.Hanke, Ken, \\"Meet Nero Wolfe\\"; Scarlet Street, issue #45, 2002, pp. 31 and 77 ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1936 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American mystery films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on mystery novels Category:Nero Wolfe Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Films directed by Herbert Biberman Category:Films produced by B.

In 2008, the developers of Quay Valley Ranch put the project on hold pending signs of an economic recovery. Planned as the largest new town in California on private land, as of April 2010, the Quay Valley project was tied up in litigation over water rights and it was unknown at that time if the project would move forward. In 2014, a court suit about water rights was settled in favor of the project; a new application for zoning was submitted in February 2015. On December 6, 2017, The Kings County Community Development Department received a formal withdrawal of the application from Quay Hays for the Quay Valley project.Kings County Board of Supervisors Action Summary of the December 12, 2017 meetingFresno Bee‚Äù, December 23, 2017 Master plan  Quay Valley would have used clean and renewable energy generated from an on- site 600-megawatt power plant. As originally proposed, the city would have consisted of about 50,000 units on built over 25 years, housing approximately 150,000 residents, using solar power for electricity. An entertainment destination district, a medical center, theme parks and an international motor speedway complex were initially proposed. The project proposal was subsequently scaled down to , 25,000 dwelling units and 75,000 residents. Project history The planned community was initially organized by over 250 Planning Team Members by Kings County Ventures LLC. In July 2007, the Quay Valley planning team established a on-site research ranch to test numerous new methods and systems which will help determine what may work best for the build out of Quay Valley. By April 2010, Kings County Ventures, LLC, the original project proponent, had been disbanded, but the partnership was still registered as active in California in 2015. Quay Hays' latest organization, GROW Land and Water LLC, filed a lawsuit in December 2009 in connection with the sale of land by McCarthy Family Farms to another party that included the attached water rights. Quay Valley proponents had planned to use that water for the proposed new city. California law requires that new cities demonstrate that they have sufficient water supplies to survive a five-year drought. Greg Gatzka, Director of the Kings County Community Development Agency, said in April 2010 that the application before his agency to build the project had been inactive for approximately a year and a half. Gaztka added that the project had yet to meet several key requirements in addition to the water issue, including a financial feasibility study and a detailed infrastructure plan. The scarcity of venture capital financing has been cited as another obstacle. Nonetheless, Quay Hays said that he remained interested in seeing the project happen. On December 12, 2017, Greg Gatza, Kings County Director of Community Development, reported at a meeting of the Kings County Board of Supervisors that on December 6, 2017, his department had received a formal withdrawal from Quay Hays on the Quay Valley project.Kings County Board of Supervisors Action Summary of the December 12, 2017 meetingFresno Bee‚Äù, December 23, 2017 Resolution of water rights On April 1, 2014, a Kings County jury awarded a $128.6 million verdict in favor of Kings County Ventures and GROW and against McCarthy Family Farms for breach of contract involving the sale of the water rights and against developer John Vidovich and Sandridge Partners for intentional interference of two contracts involving water for the Quay Valley Ranch project. Current Status In February 2015, Quay Hays submitted an application to the Kings County Community Development Department to rezone for housing and commercial development at the site. The project comprises 25,000 dwelling units to house 75,000 people (half of the 150,000 proposed initially), plus themed resort hotels and restaurants, a business park and university research park, restored wetland habitat, trails for nature walks and agriculture in a combination described as the \\"new ruralism.\\" Some features included in the original application, including a race track, have been deleted. As to water supply, Hays said that they have some state water rights and are working on acquiring more. He added that the project would use half the water that typically would be used due to water reuse. Greg Gatzka, the Kings County Community Development Agency director, said \\"there are a whole lot of questions that will have to be addressed.\\" In March 2015, Dirk Ahlborn, the CEO of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) in El Segundo, California announced a plan to build a hyperloop test system at the Quay Valley site. Ahlborn indicated that construction could begin in 2016 to be completed in 2017 with the first rides to begin in 2018 if his company can raise $100 million in funding. The company has said that this track will be a fully working and operational creation of the hyperloop, but that running speed will be reduced on the shortened track from Hyperloop's full potential. It is not decided whether a 5-mile loop or straight section will be constructed, and it may cross the Interstate bisecting the site. Ahlborn said that speeds up to may be possible. Quay Hays expects to break ground on the new community in 2016, including a working version of the Hyperloop, estimated to cost $100‚Äì150 million. In March 2016, Hays submitted a Preliminary Design Plan for Quay Valley to the Kings County Community Development Agency.http://countyofkings.com/home/showdocument?id=12648 On December 6, 2017, The Kings County Community Development Department received a formal withdrawal from Quay Hays of the application for the Quay Valley project, effectively terminating the proposal.Kings County Board of Supervisors Action Summary of the December 12, 2017 meetingFresno Bee‚Äù, December 23, 2017 ReferencesFurther reading  * External links *Quay Valley Preliminary Design Plan Category:Kings County, California Category:Proposed populated places in the United States ","title":"Quay Valley, California"},{"id":"12744869","text":"The term Seuserenre refers to the prenomens or royal names of two Egyptian pharaohs: * Khyan of the 15th Hyksos dynasty * Seuserenre Bebiankh, a native Theban king during the Second Intermediate Period.

It was designed by the architectural firm of Holabird & Roche and completed in 1925. The hotel was demolished in 1965 to make room for the First National Bank Building (now Chase Tower). The hotel was named for Orsemus Morrison, the first coroner in Chicago, who bought the site in 1838 and in 1860 built a three-story hotel with 21 rooms. Destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, this was replaced by an eight-story building. In 1915 Harry C. Moir, who had bought the property from Morrison's nephew, built a 21-floor, 500-room hotel designed by Marshall and Fox. The hotel was expanded by 650 rooms in 1918. In 1925 the firm Holabird & Roche further expanded it, adding a 46-story tower. The hotel had 1,800 rooms in 1931. A fourth, 21-story section was then added, bringing the number of rooms to 2,210, but was sold in 1937, becoming the Hotel Chicagoan; in the 1950s this was operated under lease by the Morrison.

The task force was composed of volunteer Swiss members of the Disaster Relief Unit and international specialists, equipped with the latest chemical and biological protection equipment, immunized against agents suspected for battlefield use and had its own jet transportation. The members of the team were to travel under Swiss diplomatic passports anywhere in the world in less than 24 hours of need. The task of the force was to arrive on reportedly contaminated land, assess the risk to the civilian population, respond to it and coordinate the response by other international relief agencies, telling them when it would be safe to send in their personnel. Task Force Scorpio was under the orders of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and was ready for active duty on the 28 February 1991, in time for the first Gulf War. It was not deployed. The Task force was founded by Dr Robert Steffen of the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland and co-founded by Jack Woodall, PhD, then at WHO/Geneva and leader of the WHO delegation to the Biological Weapons Convention. Re-activation The Task force was deactivated after the first Gulf War. But the World Health Organization approached the Swiss government to reactivate it in January 2003. It was to be renamed the Swiss/European WMD Task Force. No information has been published about its reactivation. In February 2016, the European Union launched a similar medical corps to respond to emergencies like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The response to that outbreak was slower and less organized than it might have been had a quick response force been available. ReferencesSources  *Clifton, M.

Cast The entire cast from last season returned for another year. Jimmy Fallon, Chris Parnell and Horatio Sanz were all promoted to repertory status, with the cast otherwise unchanged at the start of the season. As the season progressed, the show added two new cast members. Rachel Dratch, recruited from Chicago's The Second City, where she was head writer Tina Fey's comedy partner, joined the show in the episode hosted by Norm Macdonald. Towards the end of the season, Maya Rudolph of The Groundlings joined the show, starting with the episode hosted by John Goodman. This would be the final season for cast members Tim Meadows, Cheri Oteri and Colin Quinn. Meadows's tenure at Saturday Night Live lasted 10 seasons, having joined the cast in 1991 (at the time of his departure, he was the longest-tenured performer on the show). He decided to leave the show after the season for other acting opportunities.

The terms were established by NBC executives Scott Sassa and Garth Ancier. According to Peter Bogdanovich, the new contract came with the following terms: *NBC can take a Saturday Night Live cast member off the show any time after their second year on the program and put them in an NBC sitcom. *A cast member has the option of saying no to the first two shows proposed by NBC, but must accept the third deal. *NBC dictates the length of the sitcom contract, which can run as long as six years. *SNL Films, co-owned by Paramount Pictures, NBC and Lorne Michaels, has a three-movie option that would pay the star a set $75,000 for the first film, $150,000 for the second and $300,000 for the third, rates that used to be negotiable. *NBC has the option of paying those same amounts to force a cast member to say no to a film deal offered to them by another studio. The starting salary remained $5,000 per episode. Writers Starting this season Tina Fey is credited as the writing supervisor.

Overview Natural GOMS Language technique was developed by David Kieras in 1988. The motivation was to make GOMS/CCT (cognitive complexity theory) simple to use, and still keep the power and flexibility of standard GOMS. This was necessary because GOMS did not have very well defined semantics. This lack of definition meant that two equally competent evaluators could do evaluations on the same system and come up with very different results. Kieras's result was the development of high-level (natural language) syntax for GOMS representation with directions for doing a GOMS evaluation. The recipe is referred to as a \\"top-down, breadth-first\\" expansion. The user's high-level goals are unfolded until only operators remain. Generally operators are considered to be keystroke-level operations, but that is not a rigid requirement. Since NGOMSL is based on CCT, it has certain properties that make it unique. NGOMSL inherits the ability to not only give estimations for execution times but it can also estimate the time taken to learn how to use the system. It also, however, shares one of the major disadvantages all of the previous methods. NGOMSL models user interaction as a serial operation. One operation occupies the user completely, there is no multitasking, which makes NGOMSL inappropriate for analyzing tasks where the users are under time pressure, highly practiced and, in reality, do act in a parallel fashion.

Little is known of his early personal life, other than that his family moved to the Tokyo area when he was nine years old. Here he began working for Tokyo Puck Magazine as a political cartoonist and manga series artist. At the age of 26, Shimokawa was hired by Tenkatsu Production Company to create a short animated film. Shimokawa used several animation techniques that were, at the time, unique: using chalk or white wax on a dark board background to draw characters, rubbing out portions to be animated and drawing with ink directly onto film, whiting out animated portions. At the time, celluloid cels (rather than modern acetate film) were costly and scarce in Japan, having to be imported. These techniques cut production costs, material costs and completion time. The resulting film was Imokawa Mukuzo Genkanban no Maki, released in 1917. Though not the earliest animation created in Japan, it is considered to be the first \\"true\\" Anime film, as it was the first to be publicly shown in a theater. The film ran only five minutes. As with many animation works created in Japan before the mid-1920s, no trace of the film, or any of Shimokawa's five other short films, has survived. Shimokawa's animation work was cut short by chronic health problems, and he returned to work as a consultant and editor for other production companies making animated films in the 1930s and 1940s. Not much is known of his later life; indeed, very few works bear mention of his contribution beyond his own personal works.

It is linked with the human degenerative disease Lytico-Bodig disease, which is similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through a neurotoxin (BMAA) in the seeds (due to symbiosis with cyanobacteria), which were a traditional food source on Guam until the 1960s.Sacks, Oliver.

Conservation 159x159px Cycas micronesica is threatened by a combination of introduced species throughout the islands of Guam and Rota. The most notably pest is the diaspidid scale Aulacaspis yasumatsui, which was first recognized in Guam in December 2003.Terry, Irene; & Marler, Thomas. (2005). Paradise Lost? Tipping the scales against Guam‚Äôs Cycas micronesica. The Cycad Newsletter 28(3-4): 21-23. Other threats include Cycad Blue Butterfly, the longhorn beetle (Dihammus marianarum) which causes stem damage, the alien invasive snail Satsuma mercatorius which feeds on young leaflets, and habitat loss due to the growing human population. Prior to the invasion of Aulacaspis yasumatsu, it was one of the most abundant plant on Guam's forest.Donnegan, J., & Pacific Northwest Research Station. (2004). Guam's forest resources, 2002 (Resource bulletin PNW ; 243). Portland, OR: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. Plant mortality was so rapid that the species was Red Listed as Endangered in 2006, only three years after the devastating invasions began .Marler, T., & Lawrence, J. (2012). Demography of Cycas micronesica on Guam following introduction of the armoured scale Aulacaspis yasumatsui. Journal of Tropical Ecology, 28(3), 233-242. Marler, T. (2010). Cycad mutualist offers more than pollen transport. American Journal of Botany, 97(5), 841-845. Population counts in northwest Guam has declined from 686 individuals in early 2004 (before Aulacaspis yasumatsui reached this habitat) to 87 individuals in January 2007. In 2004, Rhyzobius lophanthae was employed on Guam as a biological pest control and has lessened the population decline. However, they were ineffective on protecting cycad seedlings from Aulacaspis yasumatsui predation, as lack of seed vigor is one of the major factors contributing to C. micronesica decline.Marler, T., Miller, R., & Moore, A.

Building and pre-war service Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation of Quincy, Massachusetts built the ship as SS Quirigua for United Fruit Company in 1932. She was one of six UFC sister ships driven by turbo-electric transmission. The United States Postal Service subsidised the building of the six ships, which served the USPS as mail boats. United Fruit placed Quirigua on express liner services between Central America and New York. She normally carried up to 95 passengers to ports in Central America and then would return to the United States with passengers and a cargo of refrigerated bananas and miscellaneous cargo. USS Mizar World War II Crew US Navy service The US Navy bareboat chartered Quirigua through the Maritime Commission on 2 June 1941 under Public Law 101, 77th Congress and Executive Order 8771. Brewer's Drydock Co. of Staten Island, New York converted the ship for Navy service by adding one single 5\\"/38 caliber gun, four 3\\"/50 caliber guns for anti-aircraft (AA) and anti-submarine use and up to eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannon AA guns. She was renamed Mizar and commissioned into the US Navy on 14 June 1941, commanded by Cmdr E.D. Walbridge. With some modification Mizar was able to carry a number of troops as well as her refrigerated stores. She was crewed by Merchant mariners plus a team of United States Navy Armed Guard sailors to man her guns. The Guards were assisted by the \\"civilian\\" crew and all took equal risk of being sunk by submarine or aircraft; but only the Armed Guard were judged eligible for G.I. Bill benefits. For the early part of 1942 Mizar sailed the western Atlantic from a number of US East Coast ports, supplying bases and ships from Iceland to the Virgin Islands. Pacific Theater operations Mizar was then modified with more berthing and more 20 mm AA guns before departing from Norfolk, Virginia, 10 June 1942 with task force TF 39, carrying some of the 1st US Marine Division who were to take part in the invasion of the Solomon Islands. The force transited the Panama Canal on its month-long voyage to Wellington, New Zealand. Continuing in the southwest Pacific as part of Service Force, US 7th Fleet, she operated initially from Australian ports supporting the successful Australian and American campaign to stop the Japanese on New Guinea. Mizar made seven unescorted voyages to San Francisco, California, between 12 October 1942 and 9 February 1945 to get fresh meat, fruit, vegetables, dairy products and eggs to supply advanced bases and combatant ships. When not making these crossings of the Pacific Ocean she normally worked between Brisbane and Milne, New Guinea. After the advance of US and Allied Forces in the Pacific she extended her Australian-based service to the Admiralty Islands in May 1944 and anchored in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines on 18 February 1945. She continued carrying men and supplies throughout these areas until 4 January 1946. End-of-war duties Steaming eastward she reached San Francisco 25 January but soon received orders to go to the US East Coast. Previewing a return to civilian status, en route she took bananas for the United Fruit Company from Quepos, Costa Rica to Charleston, South Carolina. Mizar averaged over 5,000 miles a month in World War II and received four battle stars for her service. She was decommissioned as a naval vessel at Baltimore, Maryland, and returned to the United Fruit Company on 1 April 1946, and struck from the Navy list of active ships on 17 April. Post-war civilian service United Fruit restored the ship's pre-war name Quirigua to her. In 1958 United Fruit transferred Quirigua and her sisters Talamanca and Veragua to its British subsidiary Elders and Fyffes. Quirigua was renamed SS Samala after an earlier Fyffes ship of the same name. She was scrapped in 1964.

A great deal of discussion regarding pregnant patients' rights has taken place in the United States. History In Western countries, medical services used during labor and delivery have increased since the 1930s. Starting in the 1950s, with the natural childbirth movement gaining strength, concern increased over typical hospital practices during childbirth. These medical services included medications and procedures that were not always necessary some of which had potential to harm the mother, the baby, or both. Various health-related and consumer organization groups began to advocate for a pregnant woman's right to be informed about medical services related to pregnancy and childbirth and for her right to refuse such services. In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) acknowledged the legal obligation of physicians to obtain informed consent for procedures related to pregnancy and childbirth in 1974. Decision-making regarding pregnant patients' care A 1987 study found that, in the preceding decade, at least 22 hospitals in the United States sought direction from the courts regarding care for pregnant patients. Fifteen court orders were sought, all but one without careful study of the legal facts of the case. In a landmark 1990 case, George Washington University Medical Center (GWUMC) announced a new policy regarding pregnant patients' rights as part of the out-of-court settlement of a case in which a pregnant patient, Angela Carder, died. The new policy stated that decisions regarding medical care for pregnant patients would be made by the patient herself, her doctors, and her family, not by the courts. Although the settlement applied only to GWUMC, the new policy, considered the most comprehensive of its kind at the time, was expected to influence other institutions. Specific rights advocated Advocates endorse a pregnant patient's right to participate in medical decisions that may affect her well- being and that of her child. Specifically, these include but are not limited to the right to know the effects and risks to both the woman and the child associated with a drug or procedure, as well as the right to know about additional and alternative treatments. Some groups, such as the American Hospital Association in its \\"Patient's Bill of Rights\\", advocate additional rights, including rights to the following: *To receive medical assistance regardless of where the patient gives birth (whether at home, in a hospital, etc.). *To refuse drug treatment of any kind. *To be accompanied during labor and birth by a person or persons she cares for and to whom she looks for emotional support. *To labor at her own pace without intervention if she chooses. *To choose her own birthing position. *To keep her baby at her bedside immediately after birth if the baby does not require specialized care, and to feed the baby according to a schedule she decides rather than according to a standard hospital regimen.

Biography Holt was born on August 18, 1872 in Brooklyn, New York City to George Chandler Holt and his wife Mary Louisa Bowen Holt. His father was an attorney who was eventually appointed to the federal judiciary. Hamilton Holt graduated from Yale University in 1894 and completed graduate work in economics and sociology at Columbia University in Manhattan, New York City three years later. Holt served as editor and publisher of the liberal weekly magazine The Independent in New York from 1897 to 1921. He was an outspoken advocate for reform, prohibition, immigrant rights, and international peace. In 1906 he published a collection of immigrants' life stories as The Life Stories of Undistinguished Americans as Told by Themselves. In 1909 Holt was a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He served on the executive committee of the League to Enforce Peace and was the first Executive Director of the endowment fund of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, established to support individuals and groups working to advance the cause of international peace.\\"Seek Fund to Honor Wilson,\\" Washington Post, June 26, 1921, pg. 81. In 1924 Holt unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate from Connecticut as a Democrat. He was soundly defeated by Hiram Bingham III, 60.4% to 38.6%. President of Rollins College In 1925, Holt became President of Rollins College and served in that capacity until 1949. His approach to education stresses a cooperative new system called the \\"Conference Plan\\" which involved extensive one-on-one interaction between professor and student. It required the college to limit enrollment and recruit professors who would be effective in their new educational mentoring roles. He also advocated a policy whereby the student body could approve or disapprove of faculty hirings, and inaugurated the Walk of Fame. Because of Holt's commitment to teaching and learning innovation, he organized a national five-day Rollins Educational Conference in 1931, led by John Dewey, that brought together leaders in non- traditional higher education. Many ideas from the meetings were integrated into the college's Conference Plan and helped establish the college's national reputation as a leading innovative teaching institution. Holt believed in the value of outstanding role models and brought to campus leaders in their fields including politicians such as presidents Calvin Coolidge, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman; inventor Thomas Edison; business leader J. C. Penney; poet Carl Sandburg; writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings; military leader General Omar Bradley; pioneering social worker Jane Addams of Hull House; jurist William O. Douglas, and actors such as James Cagney and Mary Pickford. In 1933, the American Association of University Professors investigated several dismissals and forced resignations at Rollins College. It criticized Holt's autocratic style and the lack of security of tenure at the institution. Rollins College was subsequently censured by the AAUP. Holt died on April 26, 1951, at the Day-Kimball Hospital in Putnam, Connecticut. Legacy The Rollins College evening program is named in his honor as is a street in the city of Winter Park.

His book Academical Questions (1805) is arguably important in the development of the ideas of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Life He was born in Perthshire the son of John Drummond of Perth and educated at both St Andrew's University and Oxford University. In 1798 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposers being Dugald Stewart, Alexander Keith and John Playfair. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London the following year. He lived in London from 1809 and died in Rome on 29 March 1828. Career In 1795 he was MP for St. Mawes, and in the elections of 1796 and 1801 was returned for Lostwithiel. These were both rotten boroughs in Cornwall. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1799 Drummond He became sworn as a Privy Counsellor in 1801,Concise Dictionary of National Biography and left Parliament as a diplomat, as Envoy to the court of Naples. In 1803 he became British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire....ambassador to the Court of Naples 1801-3; to the Ottoman Porte 1803-6; to the Court of Naples for the second time, 1806-9.; this reference also gives opinions by Lord Byron. Appointed by the Levant Company on 14 January 1803, he arrived at the Dardanelles the following May. He was there for less than a year and then he returned to England in 1804. From 1806 to 1809 he served as Envoy to the Court of Naples for a second time. He was knighted in 1813 or 1814. The French writer Hippolyte Auger entered his service in Italy.  The Argument of Academical Questions  The title of Drummond's book refers to the later Platonic Academy, which was, in fact, not so much Platonist as Sceptical in orientation, based on the work of Pyrrho the Sceptic and later followers of Pyrrho such as Carneades. Academical Questions is a work in the Sceptic tradition, in this case influenced by the Sceptical Scottish philosopher David Hume. According to C. E. Pulos's 1954 book The Deep Truth: A Study of Shelley's Scepticism, Drummond uses Sceptical Humean ideas in an attempt to refute the British philosophy predominant in his day, the Common Sense ideas of Thomas Reid and his followers. These had been enunciated first in Reid's An Enquiry into the Human Mind (1765). Drummond failed to unseat Reid's ideas in popularity; they remained dominant in English philosophy for the first half of the 19th century. The well-known quotation: \\"He, who will not reason is a bigot; he who cannot, is a fool; and he, who dares not, is a slave\\", originates in the preface of this book.  Legacy  In contrast to other scholars he names, Pulos argues that Shelley was decisively influenced by Academical Questions, and under its influence confidently abandoned 18th- century French materialism. According to Pulos, Drummond altered the poet Shelley's beliefs. He ceased being an 18th-century French materialist; Shelley asserted that some passions (of the heart) are \\"innate.\\" Other writings His Oedipus Judaicus references the Oedipus Aegyptiacus of Athanasius Kircher, and was printed for private circulation. It was reprinted in 1866, having proved highly controversial (introduction to 1986 reprint by James P. Carley). It interprets passages from the Book of Genesis (in particular the Chedorlaomer story), and the Book of Joshua, in allegorical fashion, with a detailed argument based on astrology.

Oeniadae or Oiniadai (), or Oeneiadae or Oineiadai (Œü·º∞ŒΩŒµŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ±Œπ), was a town in ancient Acarnania, situated on the west bank of the Achelous River, about 10 miles (16 km) from its mouth. It was one of the most important of the Acarnanian towns, being strongly fortified both by nature and by art, and commanding the whole of the south of Acarnania. It was surrounded by marshes, many of them of great extent and depth, which rendered it quite inaccessible in the winter to an invading force. Its territory appears to have extended on both sides of the Achelous, and to have consisted of the district called Paracheloitis, which was very fertile. It seems to have derived its name from the mythical Oeneus, the great Aetolian hero. The town is first mentioned about 455 BCE. The Messenians, who had been settled at Naupactus by the Athenians at the end of the Third Messenian War, shortly afterwards made an expedition against Oeniadae, which they took; but after holding it for a year, they were attacked by the Acarnanians and compelled to abandon the town. Oeniadae is represented at that time as an enemy of Athens, which is said to have been one of the reasons that induced the Messenians to attack the place. Twenty-three years before the Peloponnesian War (454 BCE) Pericles laid siege to the town, but was unable to take it. In the Peloponnesian War, Oeniadae still continued opposed to the Athenians, and was the only Acarnanian town, with the exception of Astacus, which sided with the Lacedaemonians. In the third year of the war (429 BCE) Phormion made an expedition into Acarnania to secure the Athenian ascendancy; but though he took Astacus, he did not continue to march against Oeniadae, because it was the winter, at which season the marshes secured the town from all attack. In the following year (428 BCE) his son Asopius sailed up the Achelous, and ravaged the territory of Oeniadae; but it was not till 424 BCE that Demosthenes, assisted by all the other Acarnanians, compelled the town to join the Athenian alliance. It continued to be a place of great importance during the Macedonian and Roman wars. In the time of Alexander the Great, the Aetolians, who had extended their dominions on the west bank of the Achelous, succeeded in obtaining possession of Oeniadae, and expelled its inhabitants in so cruel a manner that they were threatened with the vengeance of Alexander. Oeniadae remained in the hands of the Aetolians till 219 BCE, when it was taken by Philip V of Macedonia. This monarch, aware of the importance of the place, strongly fortified the citadel, and commenced uniting the harbour and the arsenal with the citadel by means of walls. In 211 BCE Oeniadae, together with the adjacent Nesus (Œù·øÜœÉŒøœÇ) or Nasus, was taken by the Romans, under Marcus Valerius Laevinus, and given to the Aetolians, who were then their allies; but in 189 BCE it was restored to the Acarnanians by virtue of one of the conditions of the peace made between the Romans and Aetolians in that year. From this period Oeniadae disappears from history; but it continued to exist in the time of Strabo.Strabo speaks of a town called Old Oenia (·º° œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±Œπ·Ω∞ Œü·º∞ŒΩŒ±ŒØŒ±), which was deserted in his time, and which he describes as midway between Stratus and the sea. New Oenia (·º° ŒΩ·ø¶ŒΩ Œü·º∞ŒΩŒ±ŒØŒ±), which he places 70 stadia above the mouth of the Achelous, is Oeniadae. The history of Old Oenia is unknown. Its site is near the modern Trikardo.

According to the Greek historian Herodotus, pharaoh Psamtik I, besieged Ashdod for 29 years. Ashdod had lost most of its inhabitants during those long years of siege. Background Prior to the death of King Ashurbanipal sometime in 627 BC, the Assyrian Empire was engaged in almost constant warfare on multiple fronts, with nomadic tribesmen from the south, Chaldeans initiating uprisings, Elamites supporting such rebellions and Egyptians inciting further rebellion in the Levant. In the face of these multiple threats, the Assyrians under Ashurbanipal campaigned aggressively. Despite success, the Assyrians lost too many soldiers through years of debilitating warfare. In an effort to increase Assyria's standing in the East, Ashurbanipal abandoned Egypt and concentrated on Elam. However, this left Egypt more or less unchecked, although it appears that Assyrian rule, at least at the de jure level, continued until 639 BC. Capture of Ashdod Despite the previous hostility between the two powers, it appears that the Assyrians and the Egyptians did not go to war. Indeed, as late as 605 BC, the Egyptians were actively aiding the Assyrians in an attempt to help them survive. Moreover, the Ethiopian/Nubian rulers of Egypt were driven out by the native Coptic Egyptians sometime in circa 650; therefore the Assyrians and the native Egyptians made natural allies against Nubian domination. The capture of Ashdod may have effectively reflected part of the transfer of power from the crumbling Assyrian Empire to the new Egyptian 26th Dynasty.

He was awarded the FIBA Order of Merit in 1999, and was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame, in 2007. Life Radomir ≈†aper was born to a Greek father, Panagiotis Siaperas, a retailer from the village of Eratyra in northern Greece, and a Serbian mother, Vukosava Mihajloviƒá. In 1919, after World War I, his father moved to Belgrade where he changed his name to Panta ≈†aper. The couple's first son Svetislav \\"Sveta\\" was born in early 1924, Radomir, some twenty months later in the family home in Stevan Sremac's Street in Belgrade. Young Radomir attended the \\"Vuk Karad≈æiƒá\\" primary school and the Second Men's Gymnasium in Belgrade, from which he graduated in 1944. In 1946, he enrolled in the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy of the University of Belgrade, graduating in 1950. He earned his doctorate degree in 1964, became an associate professor in 1968, and a full professor at the Faculty four years later. In 1980, Professor ≈†aper was appointed Vice-Dean of the Faculty and worked there until his retirement in 1991. While teaching at the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy, Professor ≈†aper published more than 150 scientific and professional papers. He was the author or co-author of five books on analytical chemistry and automatic regulation of chemical processes. He spent 1957 studying in Amsterdam, where he prepared his doctoral dissertation. In 1967, he agreed to start the Chemistry Institute in Khartoum, Sudan, as a UN expert. However, despite the desire of the government of Sudan and the United Nations that he stay longer, after a year ≈†aper returned to his home country to fulfil his role as president of the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia. In 1953 he married Ljiljana Marjanoviƒá, a history professor at Belgrade primary school \\"Vuk Karad≈æiƒá\\", where she also worked as school director from 1980 to 1990. Ljiljana graduated from the Belgrade University of Philosophy. She was also the president of the Belgrade Historical Society and a member of the Serbian Historical Society. Radomir also attended this school, formerly known as the Palilula Primary School, from 1932 to 1936, as did members of Ljiljana‚Äôs family from around 1820, when they first settled in Belgrade. Radomir and Ljiljana had a son, Srƒëan, who is famous as musician. ≈†aper defined his political stance - democracy and a multiparty system, in 1945 when he, then nineteen, returned from the Syrmia Front. The experience of the conscious sacrifice of an entire generation fundamentally influenced his democratic political views, to which he remained faithful until his death. Never a member of the League of Communists, in January 1990, he was one of the first members of the newly established Democratic Party. He remained in the party the rest of his life, and was at various times a member of its Political Council, chairman of the University Council, president of the Belgrade Committee and a member of the General Committee of the Democratic Party. Basketball career ≈†aper learned his first basketball moves at the Second Men's grammar school from his teacher, ƒêoka Iliƒá, and shared enthusiasm for basketball with his elder brother Sveta. They began playing basketball together with the BASK basketball club, which officially marked the beginning of Ra≈°a's basketball career. The International Basketball Federation was formed in 1936, and four years later, on 20 November 1940, the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia was established and became a member of FIBA, which had 36 members at the time. The Belgrade Championship was held in 1942, and the history of Yugoslavian basketball began, with Ra≈°a and Sveta ≈†aper defending the colours of BASK. At first, basketball was played in the House of King Alexander, then in Sokolana, but the sport of basketball did not truly come alive until early 1945. The generation of players that grew up during the war years welcomed the end of the war in the spring of 1945, and the first basketball court was laid out on the tennis courts at Mali Kalemegdan. It was at this time that Ra≈°a and his fellow players joined the newly formed Red Star basketball club. Just four months after the war ended, the boys from Kalemegdan played in Subotica as the Serbian team in the first national championship. The team consisted of Ra≈°a and Sveta ≈†aper, Neboj≈°a Popoviƒá, Vasilije Stojkoviƒá, Pavle Kostiƒá, Ivan Dimiƒá, Miodrag Stefanoviƒá and Mile Nikoliƒá. In the final game, the Yugoslav Army team defeated the Serbian team with 21-16. The rivalry between the clubs intensified year after year in all sports, including basketball. Particularly interesting championships were held in 1950 and 1951 when Partizan and Red Star scored the same number of points, but Red Star won both titles thanks to a better points-difference. Radomir ≈†aper played for Partizan from 1946 until 1953. Slavko Arneriƒá, Nenad Ku≈°iƒá, Milan Miladinoviƒá, Bora Stankoviƒá, Vilmo≈° Loci, Lajo≈° Engler, Mirko Marjanoviƒá, Zlatko Kovaƒçeviƒá, Ratko Vlahoviƒá, Bo≈æa Munƒáan and others played alongside him. The Yugoslav national team played its first international game in Bucharest in 1946, losing to Romania. Their first victory came two days later against Albania. At the European Championships in Czechoslovakia in 1947, the team finished next to last, after which Frenchman Henri Hell became the Yugoslav national team coach. He invited Radomir ≈†aper to Opatija to prepare for the qualifying tournament in Nice, where Ra≈°a played his first game with the national team. After his career as a player ended, Radomir remained in basketball all his life as an official, primarily addressing the issues of organisation and development of basketball as a sport and improving the rules of the game and the quality of refereeing. Together with Bora Stankoviƒá, he worked with the talented basketball players of the BSK basketball club, called OKK Beograd since 1958. Bora was the coach, and Ra≈°a was the technical manager. They spent four years together with the club, and their meticulous work produced a remarkable result ‚Äì the championship title in 1958/59. OKK Beograd produced many talented basketball players, including the first major legend of Belgrade basketball, Radivoj Koraƒá. Sports official At the first World Basketball Championship in Buenos Aires in 1950, Yugoslavia finished last, without achieving a single victory. Three years later, at the European Championship in Moscow, Yugoslavia finished in sixth place. Following these results, Danilo Kne≈æeviƒá, then President of the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia, invited Radomir ≈†aper, Borislav Stankoviƒá, Neboj≈°a Popoviƒá and Aleksandar Nikoliƒá, all active athletes whose playing careers were in decline or completely over, to join his staff. In the following decades, Kne≈æeviƒá‚Äôs choices proved to be the right ones, as they became the four pillars on which Yugoslav basketball was built. Back in 1945, when the four played together, they had the same goals, ideas, ambitions and strengths to turn their fantasies of achieving European and global heights into reality. Thus, the strategy to take Yugoslav basketball to the top was set in stone. The coach, Aleksandar Nikoliƒá, immediately went to the United States for professional training. Popoviƒá, Stankoviƒá and ≈†aper were just beginning to demonstrate their organisational skills. Ra≈°a was the first to receive an official position as leader of the Technical Secretariat, later renamed the Competition Commission. Popoviƒá soon became the vice-president of the Federation, and Stankoviƒá was the first ‚Äúteam leader‚Äù and, later, Secretary General. In mid-1958, the new management decided to apply to organise the twelfth European Championship, which was scheduled to take place in 1961. Nineteen teams signed up for the championship because at that time there were no qualifying games. They played from dawn to dusk for eight days. With phenomenal performances, Yugoslavia managed to reach the finals against the then-invincible team from the Soviet Union. After an epic struggle, Yugoslavia was defeated, thus winning the silver medal. This first medal in the history of Yugoslav basketball was a result beyond expectations and created new opportunities to compete with the world‚Äôs best teams. Coach Aleksandar Popoviƒá led the winning team, and Koraƒá won the title of Europe's best scorer with 216 points in nine games. This medal was followed by the rapid popularisation of basketball in the country; new clubs were sprouting up everywhere, and the number of players started to rise. Confirmation that a formula for success had been found came two years later in 1963 at the World Championship in Rio de Janeiro, where the team again won the silver medal, behind Brazil. In this Championship, they defeated both the USA (75-73) and the USSR (69-67). Later that year, at the European Championship in Wroclaw, they won another medal ‚Äì this time bronze. In late February 1965, at the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia conference held in Sarajevo, one of the closest associates of former Federation President Knezeviƒá, Radomir ≈†aper, Ph.D. in engineering, was elected president. For the first time in post-war Yugoslav sports, a former national team player became the president of a sports association. In 1967, ≈†aper was re-elected president, and in the autumn of that year, real basketball began, and a championship for the first time was played on courts, according to the European Basketball Calendar. In 1970, Yugoslavia was the host of the World Championship and beat the American team 70-63 in the final game, thus winning its first gold medal. Involved in this historical success of winning the country‚Äôs first world title were: Ratomir Tvrdiƒá, Ljubodrag Simonoviƒá, Vinko Jelovac, Trajko Rajkoviƒá, Aljo≈°a ≈Ωorga, Dragan Kapiƒçiƒá, Ivo Daneu, Kre≈°imir ƒÜosiƒá, Damir ≈†olman, Nikola Pleƒáa≈°, Dragutin ƒåermak, Petar Skansi, Ranko ≈Ωeravica, the coach, and the president of the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia, Radomir ≈†aper. At the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia Conference, held in Skopje on 26 June 1970, Ra≈°a ≈†aper was once again elected president along with vice-presidents ≈Ωeljko Cindriƒá and Neboj≈°a Popoviƒá. Bora Stankoviƒá was elected secretary-general and Boris Kristanƒçiƒá chosen as president of the Advisory Committee. Radomir ≈†aper was the president of the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia until 1973, when he was appointed secretary general. He was also the commissioner of the Yugoslav Basketball Cup and the creator and initiator of the YUBA League, a national championship organised and conceived to be the strongest tournament in the world after the American NBA. At the Congress of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) held on 24 August 1972, Radomir ≈†aper was elected president of its Technical Commission, a position in which he remained until his death in 1998. Together with Bora Stankoviƒá, he was a member of the Central Board. His contributions to the development and improvement of basketball in the world were invaluable, including introduction of new and innovative rules and improvement in the quality of refereeing. Radomir ≈†aper initiated many positive changes in Yugoslav basketball, primarily those related to the ability of the basketball organisation to strategically manage the development of the game. His invaluable contribution to the promotion of basketball rules at the international level has often been acknowledged. Since 2001, FIBA has handed out the ‚ÄúRadomir ≈†aper‚Äù award for significant contributions to furthering basketball in the world. FIBA also posthumously awarded Ra≈°a ≈†aper its Order of Merit. And on 1 March 2007, in Alcobendas, Spain, the FIBA Hall of Fame opened. Together with 38 others honored were five basketball players, coaches, referees and basketball officials from Serbia who had contributed greatly to the sport of basketball. One of them was Professor Radomir ‚ÄúRa≈°a‚Äù ≈†aper. On the occasion of 20th anniversary of Radomir ≈†aper's death a memorial tournament. This tournament used some of the innovative rules of basketball for which Radomir ≈†aper advocated during his life (mixed male women's teams, different scoring, duration of the match). Organizers of the tournament were Sport Center \\"Radivoj Koraƒá\\" and basketball clubs OKK Beograd and ≈ΩKK Radivoj Koraƒá, while the cup bearing the name Radomir ≈†aper was awarded by his son Srƒëan ≈†aper.Seƒáanje na utemeljivaƒça jugoslovneske ko≈°arke.

Early life Jiro Horikoshi was born near the city of Fujioka, Gunma Prefecture, Japan, in 1903. Horikoshi graduated from the newly established Aviation Laboratory (K≈çk≈´ Kenky≈´jo) within the Engineering Department of the University of Tokyo, and started his career in Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Company Limited, which later became Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nagoya Aircraft Manufacturing Plant. Aircraft designer A6M1 design team, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (July, 1937) Horikoshi (October, 1938) Jiro Horikoshi's first work was the flawed Mitsubishi 1MF10, an experimental aircraft that never passed the prototype stage after some flight tests. However, lessons learned from this design led to the development of the far more successful Mitsubishi A5M (Allied codename \\"Claude\\") which entered mass production in 1936. In 1937, Horikoshi and his team at Mitsubishi were asked to design Prototype 12 (corresponding to the 12th year of the Sh≈çwa era). Prototype 12 was completed in July 1940, and it was accepted by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Since 1940 was the Japanese year 2600, the new fighter was named as \\"Model 00\\" or \\"Zero\\" or A6M Zero, in Japan also known as the \\"Rei-sen\\" (literally meaning \\"zero fight\\", shortened for Model zero fighter airplane). Subsequently, he was involved with designing many other fighters manufactured by Mitsubishi, including the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden (\\"Thunderbolt\\") and the Mitsubishi A7M Reppu (\\"Strong gale\\"). The wartime years Despite Mitsubishi's close ties to the Japanese military establishment and his direct participation in the nation's buildup towards the Second World War, Horikoshi was strongly opposed to what he regarded as a futile war. Excerpts from his personal diary during the final year of the war were published in 1956 and made his position clear: On 7 December 1944, a powerful earthquake in the Tokai region forced Mitsubishi to halt aircraft production at its plant in Ohimachi, Nagoya. An air raid made by B-29s on the Mitsubishi Engine Works in Daiko-cho, Nagoya a week later caused extensive damage to the works and a severe setback in production. Horikoshi, who had been at a conference in Tokyo with Imperial Navy officers to discuss the new Reppu fighter, returned to Nagoya on the 17th, in time to experience another air raid on the Mitsubishi factories the next day. As a result of the air raid, the company evacuated its machinery and engineers to the suburbs of eastern Nagoya. Horikoshi and the Engineering Department were rehoused in a school building which had been requisitioned. Exhausted and overworked, Horikoshi fell ill with pleurisy on 25 December and remained bedridden through early April. During this time, he recorded in detail the horrors of the increasing air raids on Tokyo and Nagoya, including the devastating Operation Meetinghouse Tokyo incendiary raid of 9‚Äì10 March. A massive air raid on Nagoya the following night, with B-29s hurling \\"tens of thousands of incendiary bombs,\\" destroyed most of the largely wooden city. On 12 March, Horikoshi sent most of his family, including his elderly mother, children and brother-in-law, to his home village near Takasaki to be safe from the bombings, though his wife remained with him in Nagoya. Though greatly weakened by his long illness, Horikoshi returned to work at Mitsubishi in May. He was assigned to the company's No. 1 Works, located at Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture. While on the train to Matsumoto, he witnessed the true scale of the war's impact on Nagoya: Still very weak, Horikoshi was sent home to rest after only a week back at work. He returned to his hometown, where he rejoined his family and rested through the month of July. In his diary, he recorded how they could still hear distant explosions as the Allies bombed nearby Takasaki and Maebashi. During the war's final months, Horikoshi recorded Japan's descent into chaos and exhaustion. Though he returned to work at the Matsumoto plant on 22 July, as Matsumoto had been spared from air raids, he found the workforce demoralised and operations in chaos as a result of the emergency evacuations which had scattered employees and workshops around the country. Most of the remaining Mitsubishi employees abandoned all efforts to work by early August and prepared for Japan's defeat and surrender, which finally came on 15 August. Later life After the war, Horikoshi participated in the design of the YS-11 with Hidemasa Kimura. He subsequently left Mitsubishi and taught at educational and research institutions. From 1963 to 1965, he was a lecturer at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Space and Aeronautics, and was subsequently a professor at the National Defense Academy from 1965 to 1969. Between 1972 and 1973, he was a professor of the Faculty of Engineering of Nihon University. In 1956, Horikoshi collaborated on a book about the Zero with Okumiya Masatake, a general in the JASDF and a former Imperial Navy commander who had led Zero fighter squadrons during the war. The book was published in the US in 1956 as Zero: The Story of Japan's Air War in the Pacific. In semi-retirement by the early 1970s, he served as an advisor to the society of Japanese aircraft constructors, and continued to receive letters from aircraft enthusiasts around the world. On a trip to New York, he travelled to Long Island and stayed in the Garden City Hotel, where Charles Lindbergh had spent the night before his solo trans-Atlantic flight in 1927. In the 1973 autumn honours list, Horikoshi was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Third Class, for his achievements. His memoir regarding the development of the Zero was published in Japan in 1970, and was translated by the University of Washington Press as Eagles of Mitsubishi: The Story of the Zero Fighter, which was published in English in 1981. Horikoshi died of pneumonia in a Tokyo hospital on 11 January 1982, aged 78. His obituary was covered in several major newspapers around the world. He was posthumously promoted to the fourth rank in the order of precedence. He was survived by five children, none of whom pursued a career in aircraft design or engineering. In popular culture Horikoshi is the subject of The Wind Rises, a fictionalized biographical animated film by Hayao Miyazaki, released in 2013, in which his voice was provided by Hideaki Anno (and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the English dub). In particular, although the film follows the progression of his aircraft designs, the details of his personal life are mostly fictitious (for example, he had an older brother, not a younger sister). (as of the 23rd December of 2014 this link is now offline, and ) These additional plot elements were adapted by Miyazaki from Hori Tatsuo's 1937 novel The Wind Has Risen.http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/09/the-wind-rises-hayao- miyazaki-video_n_5295745.html References ;Bibliography * Category:1903 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Aircraft designers Category:Japanese aerospace engineers Category:Japanese engineers Category:Mitsubishi Heavy Industries people Category:Nihon University faculty Category:People from Gunma Prefecture Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:20th-century engineers ","title":"Jiro Horikoshi"},{"id":"12745547","text":"New Bern High School is a high school in New Bern, North Carolina whose students come from the New Bern, Trent Woods, Brices Creek, Bridgeton, and James City area.

Historical background The university was called Southern Institute when it was founded in 1927. The institute began by offering a complete elementary course and the first two years of secondary education. In response to public demand, the secondary course was made complete with the addition of the third and the fourth year levels. Classes were held in a house on Colon Street. With the increase in the school population, the school moved to a more spacious location on Mabini Street. Collegiate courses were opened in 1933. With complete collegiate courses in the Arts and Sciences, Education, Commerce, Law and Engineering, the name was changed to Southern College in 1937. The Second World War in 1942‚Äì45 razed the buildings to the ground with the exception of the facade of the Administration Building. The U.S. Army occupied the campus. After the war the school was reconstructed, using the surplus materials bought from the U.S. Army. In 1949, the Southern College was granted the permit to open a graduate school. Having attained university status, the name was changed to University of Southern Philippines on July 8, 1949. The graduate courses that have been offered since are Master of Arts in English, Master of Arts in Teaching Sociology, Master of Arts in Teaching English, Master of Laws, and Master of Science in Social Work. The above expansions caused the Mabini Campus to extend itself to V. Gullas (formerly Manalili) and P. Burgos streets where the Sanson and the Do√±a Beatriz Hall which house the Elementary Department, the Gonzales Hall which houses the college of engineering, and the Home Economics Building are. The Engineering Laboratory was at Colon Street and served as a training center for other short-term vocational courses like refrigeration, welding and auto mechanics. In 1959, the stockholders agreed to dissolve the original stock corporation and converted USP into a non-stock, non-profit foundation. On May 28, 1959, it was registered with SEC as foundation. Envisioning the eventual congestion at the Mabini Campus and noting the trend of dispersal among educational institutions to the suburbs, the founder, in 1962, established the USP Lahug Campus which is on Salinas Drive. The Lahug Campus is now the main campus of the university. In 1968 USP founder, engineer Agustin Jereza, died. He left behind a rich legacy of educational opportunities. His heirs have picked up the challenge and are exerting every effort to perpetuate the ideals of the university as envisioned by the founder. In 1970, the Master of Laws was offered and in 1975 Master of Science in Social Work was added to the graduate school curricular offerings. In 1986, graduate school expanded with the opening of Doctor of Education. On January 25, 1989, fire gutted the Administration Building at the Mabini Campus which housed the library and the administrative offices. In 1989‚Äì90, the university president, engineer Oscar Jereza, Sr. announced the decision reached by the Board of Trustees to temporarily stop operations in all levels at the Mabini Campus. This was aimed at cutting costs by concentrating in one campus ‚Äî the Lahug Campus. Recognizing the moral obligation of the institution towards the students, classes were conducted for all graduating students at the Lahug Campus during 1990‚Äì91. No new enrolees, however, were admitted to college. By 1991‚Äì92, the university, under the leadership of the new president, Dr. Ronald R. Duterte, decided to reopen college operations phasing in the courses by year levels; that is, first year of all recognized courses was offered during this school year; first and second year by 1992‚Äì93, and so on until all years are opened. In 1990 transfer of the college to Lahug Campus was completed. In 1993, the Computer Studies Center was inaugurated. In 1994, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science was offered. In August 1996, the USP Alumni Hall which houses the famous Rizaliana Museum was inaugurated. February 1995, USPF opened the non-academic skills-based Continuing Education Department, now the Learning Resource Center in partnership with the Manpower Resource Center, now TESDA. In June 1999, the College of Law reopened and a new graduate program, Master of Science in Environmental Management was offered. In 2002, the ground breaking was done for the new building that would house the College of Nursing, College of Computer Studies, College of Law, College of Engineering, and the Theater for Performing Arts. In 2003, the College of Nursing started in its initial operation and its doing well. On March 5, 2004, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) issued a permit for USPF to open and conduct first and second years of the four-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy starting June 2004. On March 19, 2004, CHED issued a permit for USPF to open and conduct Diploma in Professional Education (DPEd) and Diploma in Special Education (DSPEd). On June 10, 2005 CHED issued Government Recognition for USPF to conduct and operate the post baccalaureate diploma in Community Development effective academic year 2005‚Äì2006. On the same date, CHED also issued a permit to open and conduct first year of the four-year course in Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship effective Academic Year 2005‚Äì2006. On November 20, 2005, the university president Dr. Ronald R. Duterte died. On December 1, 2005 the Board of Trustees appointed Dr. Alicia P. Cabatingan as the new president. In 2006, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education successfully passed the PACUCOA Level I Accreditation during a visit February 20‚Äì22, 2006. In school year 2007-2008 University of Southern Philippines triumphed over the nationwide results of two of the most prestigious Licensure Exams. The same year the university processed the accreditation of five departments: School of Business and Management, College of Computer Studies and Information Technology and the Basic Education of Mabini and Lahug campuses. In 2009, USPF started Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, and Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. The College of Computer Studies and School of Business and Management was granted Level I Status by the Philippines Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation in 2014. In school year 2010‚Äì2011, two programs were granted Level II Accreditation Status: the Bachelor of Secondary Education and Liberal Arts Programs and Level I Status for the Bachelor of Elementary Education. After the Level II Formal Visit of the Bachelor of Secondary Education, PACUCOA accelerated the program for LEVEL III Format Visit on February next year April 2016.

The Quadrature of the Parabola () is a treatise on geometry, written by Archimedes in the 3rd century BC. Written as a letter to his friend Dositheus, the work presents 24 propositions regarding parabolas, culminating in a proof that the area of a parabolic segment (the region enclosed by a parabola and a line) is 4/3 that of a certain inscribed triangle. The statement of the problem used the method of exhaustion. Archimedes may have dissected the area into infinitely many triangles whose areas form a geometric progression. He computes the sum of the resulting geometric series, and proves that this is the area of the parabolic segment. This represents the most sophisticated use of the method of exhaustion in ancient mathematics, and remained unsurpassed until the development of integral calculus in the 17th century, being succeeded by Cavalieri's quadrature formula.  Main theorem  Archimedes inscribes a certain triangle into the given parabolic segment. A parabolic segment is the region bounded by a parabola and line. To find the area of a parabolic segment, Archimedes considers a certain inscribed triangle. The base of this triangle is the given chord of the parabola, and the third vertex is the point on the parabola such that the tangent to the parabola at that point is parallel to the chord. By Proposition 1 (Quadrature of the Parabola), a line from the third vertex drawn parallel to the axis divides the chord into equal segments. The main theorem claims that the area of the parabolic segment is 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle.  Structure of the text  Archimedes gives two proofs of the main theorem. The first uses abstract mechanics, with Archimedes arguing that the weight of the segment will balance the weight of the triangle when placed on an appropriate lever. The second, more famous proof uses pure geometry, specifically the method of exhaustion. Of the twenty-four propositions, the first three are quoted without proof from Euclid's Elements of Conics (a lost work by Euclid on conic sections). Propositions four and five establish elementary properties of the parabola; propositions six through seventeen give the mechanical proof of the main theorem; and propositions eighteen through twenty-four present the geometric proof.  Geometric proof = Dissection of the parabolic segment  Archimedes' dissection of a parabolic segment into an arbitrary number of triangles. The main idea of the proof is the dissection of the parabolic segment into infinitely many triangles, as shown in the figure to the right. Each of these triangles is inscribed in its own parabolic segment in the same way that the blue triangle is inscribed in the large segment.  Areas of the triangles  In propositions eighteen through twenty-one, Archimedes proves that the area of each green triangle is one eighth of the area of the blue triangle. From a modern point of view, this is because the green triangle has half the width and a fourth of the height:The green triangle has half of the width of blue triangle by construction. The statement about the height follows from the geometric properties of a parabola, and is easy to prove using modern analytic geometry. center By extension, each of the yellow triangles has one eighth the area of a green triangle, each of the red triangles has one eighth the area of a yellow triangle, and so on. Using the method of exhaustion, it follows that the total area of the parabolic segment is given by :\\\\text{Area}\\\\;=\\\\;T \\\\,+\\\\, 2\\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{8}\\\\right) \\\\,+\\\\, 4\\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{8^2}\\\\right) \\\\,+\\\\, 8 \\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{8^3}\\\\right) \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\cdots. Here T represents the area of the large blue triangle, the second term represents the total area of the two green triangles, the third term represents the total area of the four yellow triangles, and so forth. This simplifies to give :\\\\text{Area}\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\left(1 \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{16} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{64} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\cdots\\\\right)T.  Sum of the series  Archimedes' proof that To complete the proof, Archimedes shows that :1 \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{16} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{64} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\cdots\\\\;=\\\\; \\\\frac{4}{3}. The formula above is a geometric series‚Äîeach successive term is one fourth of the previous term. In modern mathematics, that formula is a special case of the sum formula for a geometric series. Archimedes evaluates the sum using an entirely geometric method,Strictly speaking, Archimedes evaluates the partial sums of this series, and uses the Archimedean property to argue that the partial sums become arbitrarily close to 4/3. This is logically equivalent to the modern idea of summing an infinite series. illustrated in the adjacent picture. This picture shows a unit square which has been dissected into an infinity of smaller squares. Each successive purple square has one fourth the area of the previous square, with the total purple area being the sum :\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{16} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{64} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\cdots. However, the purple squares are congruent to either set of yellow squares, and so cover 1/3 of the area of the unit square. It follows that the series above sums to 4/3.

In the original broadcasts, two Rocky and Bullwinkle segments were aired as part of each half-hour program, along with several supporting features and bumpers.  Overview  There is a difference of opinion regarding the titles famously used as teasers at the end of most Rocky and Bullwinkle segments to promote the next episode (e.g. \\"Don't miss tomorrow's exciting episode: Bullwinkle's Ride or Goodbye, Dollink\\"). Some sources, such as IMDb, use them as actual titles for the individual episodes. Others, however, regard them simply as each segment's final gag (most involve cultural references‚Äîsometimes rather obscure‚Äîand frequently dreadful puns) rather than as actual titles. While these titles are mentioned at the end of most episodes they never appear in or on the episodes to which they supposedly refer. NOTE: The episode titles used below are the titles used on title cards in syndicated versions. Indeed, while these titles invariably refer to the characters' predicament at the end of the segment, they often do not apply to anything that actually appears in the subsequent episode. The Rocky and Bullwinkle DVDs do not use these titles, referring to the individual segments simply by number. However, Keith Scott's The Moose that Roared, prepared in cooperation with Jay Ward's family and production company, does use them.Scott, Keith (2000). The moose that roared: the story of Jay Ward, Bill Scott, a flying squirrel, and a talking moose. New York: St. Martins'. The first two seasons appeared on ABC as Rocky and His Friends. The last three seasons aired on NBC as The Bullwinkle Show. Today they are known collectively as The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show or simply Rocky and Bullwinkle. For legal reasons, current DVD editions title the reassembled programs The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. Rocky and Bullwinkle story arcs generally end with the title characters riding off into the sunset. Rather than promoting a specific upcoming episode or story line the narrator simply exhorts viewers to \\"tune in next time\\" for the heroes' further adventures. Thus, the initial segment of each story arc is not named in the preceding episode; these episodes take their names from the story arc that they begin. Season 1 (1959‚Äì60) The first season contained twenty-six half-hour shows, each of which included five segments. Production of the first season was intentionally halted after twenty-six shows, as twenty-six weekly programs would fill exactly half a year and simplify any rerun schedule. Jet Fuel Formula The first story in the series is also the longest. Bullwinkle and Rocky are introduced when their cake recipe proves to be an excellent rocket propellant, but it draws the attention of two notorious spies (Boris and Natasha) as well as two alien beings from the Moon itself. Box Top Robbery The world's economy becomes so dependent on box top refunds that Boris and Natasha are able to cause worldwide sabotage via counterfeiting. Season 2 (1960‚Äì61) The second season contained 260 segments, exactly five times the number of the first season. During this period the program was broadcast semiweekly. Upsidaisium Bullwinkle inherits a mine on Mount Flatten. When he and Rocky go there, they find that Mount Flatten floats in the sky because it is the only source of upsidaisium, the anti-gravity metal. Its value is such that Boris and Natasha's overlord, Mister Big, becomes personally involved in attempts to steal first the mountain and then the government's storehouse of ore. Metal-Munching Mice A legion of six-foot robot mice descend upon Earth and devour television reception antennas. Greenpernt Oogle The Brooklyn-accented ruler of a South Pacific island kidnaps Bullwinkle after the island's dominant bird disappears. Rue Britannia Boris is hired by three greedy brothers in London after their uncle bequeaths his mansion to Bullwinkle. Buried Treasure Boris masquerades as a US gangster and uses his new hirelings to rob Frostbite Falls' bank. The Last Angry Moose Bullwinkle suddenly believes he is a brilliant actor and is conned by Boris into making a movie - which proves more popular than anyone expects. Wailing Whale Boris rampages through the sea with a giant robot whale. Season 3 (1961‚Äì62) Season 3 contained 165 segments. The Three Moosketeers Bullwinkle's skills with Shish kebob lead him to be hired by the sole surviving Musketeer. Lazy Jay Ranch Rocky and Bullwinkle buy a suffering dude ranch that raises worms. Meanwhile, Boris and Natasha are trying to get rid of them so they can gain the mineral rights to the ranch. Missouri Mish Mash Rocky & Bullwinkle, Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader, and the Moonmen all become involved in the hunt for the powerful Kirwood Derby Topsy Turvy World Boris causes the Earth to tilt so that the South Pole is switched to the Pacific. Season 4 (1962‚Äì63) Season 4 contained 95 segments. Painting Theft Boris and Natasha rob a museum in Paris and hide their paintings on Bullwinkle's farm, until Bullwinkle splatters whitewash on the paintings and finds he can sell them to snooty art collectors. The Guns of Abalone Boris and Natasha lay siege to the world via powerful cannons. The Treasure of Monte Zoom Boris goes after a treasure hidden in a Minnesota lake. Goof Gas Attack Pottsylvania has developed a nerve gas that renders intelligent people helplessly foolish but doesn't affect Bullwinkle. Banana Formula Running out of ideas, Boris and Natasha stumble upon a new sound-suppressed explosive named \\"Hush-a-Boom\\", but lose the formula when they foolishly inscribe it on a banana that Bullwinkle promptly devours. Season 5 (1963‚Äì64) Season 5 contained 165 segments. Bumbling Brothers CircusMucho LomaPottsylvania Creeper Fearless Leader enters a man-eating plant in a Frostbite Falls flower contest and the plant spreads vast amounts of seeds that grow into an army of man-eating plants. Moosylvania Bullwinkle discovers the lost state of Moosylvania and goes to Washington DC to campaign for the land's inclusion in the US. The Ruby Yacht An Indian ruler seeks a boat encrusted with valuable jewels that Bullwinkle finds in a lake. Bullwinkle's Testimonial Dinner Bullwinkle's attempt to get his expensive suit cleaned for a dinner in his honor becomes a chase to a Chinese laundrette that fronts for illegal activities by Boris and Natasha. The Weather Lady A fortune telling machine in the form of a lady is used by Boris and Natasha for an illegal gambling boat. Louse on 92nd Street Bullwinkle witnesses a known gangster commit a crime and now must be guarded lest Boris, a fanatical admirer of the gangster, eliminate him. Wossamotta U A forlorn college football team discovers Bullwinkle's unstoppable abilities as a passer and it quickly swells into undefeated success and superstardom, drawing out sports gamblers Boris and Natasha as well as a Southern Revanchist. Moosylvania Saved To draw needed resources for Pottsylvania, Fearless Leader tricks Bullwinkle and Rocky into getting foreign aid to Moosylvania he intends Boris and Natasha to steal. Short film (2014) A Rocky and Bullwinkle short titled Rocky and Bullwinkle also known as Another Fine Moose You've Gotten Me Into or The Man In The Iron Moose, made by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Gary Trousdale, was to be shown in theaters before Mr. Peabody & Sherman, which opened on March 7, 2014. This plan was dropped, but the short was later released with the film on Blu-ray 3D. Notes There is conflict between several online sources regarding the division of the story arcs into seasons.

History=World War I Organized as part of the 79th Division A.E.F. (American Expeditionary Force) ‚Äì World War I The United States in World War I, the men of the 314th were trained at Camp Meade (later renamed Fort George G. Meade in 1929), Maryland. Arriving at the camp in September, 1917, the unit was included in the 157th Infantry Brigade of Brigadier General William Jones Nicholson, along with the 313th Infantry Regiment and the 311th Machine Gun Battalion. The regiment completed training and sailed to France aboard the USS Leviathan in July, 1918. Upon arrival at Brest, France, they continued training until September 1918, then took part in the Meuse Argonne Offensive. Capturing the town of Malancourt on 26 September 1918, they assisted the 313th Infantry on the following day in the capture of the town of Montfaucon-d'Argonne. Montfaucon was a heavily defended area and observation post of the German army. Of the four Infantry regiments of the 79th Division involved in the offensive, the 314th was hardest-hit. It took several days to account for all the missing personnel and bring the regiment up 50 percent manning. The 79th Division was relieved on 30 September and transferred to the Troyon sector. While there, they assumed a variety of duties, including holding the front. They shared the trenches with the 313th, 315th, and 316th Infantry Regiments. During this time, they were harassed with mustard gas, shelling, and enemy trench and air raids but held the line. At the end of October, the 79th Division was again ordered to move to participate in the third phase of the Meuse Argonne Offensive. On 1 November 1918, the 314th advanced. By 9 November, they captured the towns of Crepion, Waville, and Moirey. The following day the unit captured Buisson Chaumont, Hill 328. On 11 November, the 314th advanced against Cote de Romagne and stopped firing at 11 a.m., at the time of the Armistice. By the end day, the 314th had made the greatest advance into German lines east of the Meuse River. The regiment continued training, passed a review by General Pershing, and shipped home on 15 May 1919, aboard the USS Princess Matoika. Arriving at Hoboken, New Jersey on 26 May 1919, they were discharged from service at Camp Dix, New Jersey. World War II History of the Log Cabin  right Erected at Camp Meade, Maryland in 1917 by the men of the 314th as an Officers' Club and assembly room, it was purchased from the U.S. government after the war, carefully disassembled, and rebuilt on ground provided by the Washington Memorial Chapel by members of the Regiment. Dedicated in 1922 by the Veterans of the 314th A.E.F. to honor the 362 men of the Regiment who made the supreme sacrifice. The cabin housed artifacts of the 314th which allowed a glimpse at how life was for the men during the First World War.

It consists of the removal of the hippocampus, which has a role in memory, spatial awareness, and navigation, and the amygdalae, which have a role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions, both structures forming part of the limbic system of the brain. Amygdalohippocampectomy is used only when all other treatment options have failed to resolve the epilepsy. It is an effective treatment for most patients. However, possible adverse side effects include impaired memory and defects in visual perception.  Procedure  Amygdalae The amygdalohippocampectomy is indicated when the focal point of the seizures can be anatomically localized to the hippocampus and amygdala. Normally, to be considered for this procedure, one must have failed all first- line treatments. The selective amygdalohippocampectomy will remove only the offending portions of the hippocampus and amygdala. When data from studies of the electrophysiology and neuropathy vis-√†-vis temporal lobe epilepsy determines this area to be the origin of seizure activity, the removal of the hippocampus and amygdala is usually indicated. Computer imaging is sometimes used to guide this procedure. Patients continue normal activity after approximately six to eight weeks.  Statistics and side effects  Of 376 patients who had the amygdalohippocampectomy procedure performed, compared to other types of temporal lobe resections, two thirds of this population were reported free of disabling seizures.

He commanded the sniper team from the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry attached to the United States Army 187th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division during Operation Anaconda in the Shah-i-kot Valley, Paktia Province, Afghanistan in March 2002. The sniper team recorded more than 20 priority target kills, including the long distance record combat kill of set by Corporal Rob Furlong. Master Corporal Ragsdale, with selfless disregard for his own personal safety, operated his sniper team through extreme weather conditions at high altitude while under direct and indirect enemy fire aiding the success of the mission by identifying and neutralizing enemy targets and saving allied lives. He was awarded the United States Bronze Star Medal with \\"V\\" device for his actions in combat and was Mentioned in Despatches by the Canadian Forces for valiant conduct and meritorious service. Military career Graham Ragsdale was born on 28 June 1969 in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. He joined the Canadian Forces in 1988 after graduating from secondary school and, upon completion of selection and parachute training, he was posted as a paratrooper to 2 Commando of the now disbanded Canadian Airborne Regiment, Special Service Force (SSF), where he gained the reconnaissance, sniper, tracker, machine gunner, and mountain operations qualifications. In 1991, after his initial three year service contract, he transferred from the regular force to the primary reserve unit Canadian Rangers Patrol Group to serve as an instructor while attending university and pursuing a promising amateur boxing career. He rejoined the regular force in 1996 and was posted to the newly formed 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, where he gained the mortarman, leadership, jumpmaster, freefall parachute instructor, unarmed combat instructor, British pathfinder and British sniper qualifications. In 2000 he completed a tour of duty in the Former Yugoslavia with NATO's Stabilization Force, and was then given the command role of battalion master sniper in charge of the sniper group that in 2002 was deployed to Afghanistan as part of the US Operation Enduring Freedom and Canadian Operation Apollo. In contrast to the accolades of American soldiers that fought beside the Canadian snipers in the Shah-i-kot, a controversial decision made by the Canadian chain of command following Operation Anaconda unceremoniously relieved Master Corporal Ragsdale of command of the sniper group amidst misconduct allegations against Master Corporal Arron Perry. As a result, a despondent Ragsdale chose to release from the military shortly after the tour in favor of employment as a private security contractor in Afghanistan and Africa with Aegis Defence Services and Tundra Group.

Life Payen was born in Soignies, and received his earliest musical training in that town, in the church of St. Vincent. When he was about 13 years old he went to Spain to sing in the choir of Charles V; children were commonly recruited in the Low Countries for service in the imperial chapel. In the 1530s he may have attended university, but this portion of his life is poorly documented. In the 1540s he rose in the chapel hierarchy, becoming successively a clerc and a chaplain, and in 1556 he took over the post of maestro di capilla, the director of music, from Cornelius Canis who had retired the previous year simultaneously with the abdication of Charles V. Thus Payen became the first maestro di capilla for Habsburg monarch Philip II of Spain.Dunning, Grove online, \\"Nicolas Payen\\" Payen acquired honors including prebends. In 1558 he became canon at the church in Tournai. He died in Madrid the next year or shortly after. Music and influence Payen's music is both sacred and secular, and all surviving music is vocal, although some of his chansons were later arranged for lute. Thirteen motets and five chansons have survived with attribution to him. The motets include some written for state occasions, such as Carole cur defles, for the death of Queen Isabella, in 1545. One, In Gott gelaub ich das er hat, is in German. All are for four or five voices. His chansons are all for four voices, and all are in French. His name appears in association with the controversial term musica reservata, a style of composition and performance beginning around the mid-16th century, which most likely involved intensely expressive setting of text, chromatic part-writing, and small audiences of connoisseurs.Atlas, p. 629 The Bavarian ambassador to the court of Charles V wrote a letter to his employer, Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria, expressing what would happen when Payen would become maestro di capilla of the Flemish Chapel (capilla flamenca) for the Habsburg king: \\"musica reservata will become even more fashionable now than before, [after Nicolas Payen succeeds Cornelius Canis for the position], since Canis was not able to reconcile himself to it.\\" Thus Payen was a composer in a progressive style to Canis's more conservative bent.Dunning, Grove online, \\"Musica reservata\\" For further informations Laura Pollie Mc Dowell, \\"Nicolas Payen - Motets and chansons\\", A-R Edition, Middleton, 2006  Motets  * Virgo prudentissima * Coenantibus illis * Carole cur defles Isabellam * Nunc dimittis * Resurrectio Christi/Surrexit * Qui dabit capiti * Convertimini ad me * Domine, deus salutis * Confitemur delicta * Nisi quia Dominus erat in nobis * Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel * Eripe me de inimicis meis Domine  Songs  * Fringotes jeusnes fillettes * Hau de par Dieu * Il y a de lognon * Je ne me puis tenir * Avecque vous mon amour finira * Vien tost despiteux desconfort  Choir  * In Gott gelaub ich das er hatLaura Pollie Mc Dowell, \\"Nicolas Payen - Motets and chansons\\", A-R Edition, Middleton, 2006 Recordings * 3 motets and 6 chansons by Payen on Tota Vita - Music for Charles V.

Poe later claimed to have given English \\"a flogging which he will remember to the day of his death\\", though English denied it; either way, the fight ended their friendship and stoked further gossip about the scandal.

In 1896, he published Reminisces of Poe, in which he hinted at scandals without specificity.

It's served by L4 (yellow line), and tram route T4, of which it is a terminus. It was built in 1977 under Parc de Carles I. It was closed between 1991 and 1992 because of infrastructure improvement with the occasion of the 1992 Olympic Games, and again as of mid-2007 due to improvement of L4. Within two blocks stands the Ciutadella campus of Pompeu Fabra University and the station is often crowded with university students. In summer it's also common to spot tourists heading to the Barceloneta beach. The nearest metro stations are Barceloneta and Bogatell.

It is a water-soluble modified starch polymer containing 0.9% iodine, calculated on a weight-weight basis, within a helical matrix.Merck Index, 14th Edition, p262 Merck & Co. Inc. History Cadexomer iodine was developed in the early 1980s in Sweden by Perstorp AB, and given the name Iodosorb. The product was shown to be effective in the treatment of venous ulcers,. More recently, it has been shown in studies in animals and humans that, unlike the iodophor povidone- iodine, Iodosorb causes an acceleration of the healing process in chronic human wounds. This is due to an increase in epidermal regeneration and epithelialization in both partial-thickness and full-thickness wounds. In this way cadexomer iodine acts as a cicatrizant. Properties When formulated as a topical wound dressing, Iodosorb adsorbs exudate and particulate matter from the surface of granulating wounds and, as the dressing becomes moist, iodine is released. The product thus has the dual effect of cleansing the wound and exerting a bactericidal action. The bactericidal mechanism of cadexomer iodine is effective against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and may prevent MRSA proliferation in the wound bed. This is especially significant because bacteria populations have shown no sign of developing a resistance to iodine since it was first used for wound treatment in the middle of the 19th century. Uses In addition to other manufacturers, Smith & Nephew distributes cadexomer iodine as Iodosorb and Iodoflex in many countries of the world for the treatment and healing of various types of wounds. The dosage forms are a paste dressing, an ointment and a gel, all of which contain 0.9% iodine.It is available in India under brand name Cadomer and is sold by JB Chemicals  See also  * Antiseptic * Chlorhexidine * Iodophor * Inadine * Povidone-iodine * Lugol's iodine * Tincture of iodine  References  Category:Iodine compounds ","title":"Cadexomer iodine"},{"id":"12745761","text":"Crilanomer is a cicatrizant.

Studies of becaplermin showed that when used with good wound care, complete healing significantly increased and the ulcers healed on average 6 weeks faster. Pharmacoeconomic studies reinforce the cost effectiveness of becaplermin as an adjunct to good wound care. The amount of becaplermin to be applied will vary depending upon the size of the ulcer area. Becaplermin should be stored in the refrigerator. Analysis of healing human wounds showed that PDGF-BB induces fibroblast proliferation and differentiation and was found to increase healing in patients with decreased healing capacity, such as people living with diabetes.

The Precambrian rock on its southern side is mostly provided by the Beartooth Mountains. The region had a quartz monzonite intrusion and underwent extensive metamorphism, faulting and folding during the Archean at about 2500 Mya. The area was intruded by north trending mafic dikes before being unconformably covered by a middle-Cambrian sedimentary rock sequence.Jackson, Everett D., The Chromite Deposits of the Stillwater Complex, Montana in Ore Deposites of the Unitrd States, 1933-1967 (The Graton-Sales Volume) Vol. 2, pp. 1495-1509, 1968 The intrusion forms a linear body stretching some 30 miles (48 km) and striking roughly N 60 ¬∞W and dipping from 50¬∞ to near 90¬∞ to the northeast. The exposed thickness is around 18,000 feet (5500 m) with an additional estimated 5,000 to 15,000 feet (1524 to 4572 m) having been removed from the top by pre-Cambrian erosion. Stanton, R.

Thickness up to 700 feet (210 m). *The Ultramafic series is composed of a lower peridotite member (Peridotite zone) consisting of alternating dunite, chromitite, harzburgite and bronzite pyroxenite. The upper third is massive, monotonous bronzitite (Bronzitite zone). The Ultramafic series averages around 3500 feet (1100 m) in thickness. *The Banded series is composed of alternating norite, gabbro and anorthosite. The Banded series has a maximum thickness of 14,000 feet (4300 m). Orebodies The chromium orebodies are restricted to the Peridotite zone of the Ultramafic series. The platinum group orebody is located in the lower part of the Banded series within a horizon referred to as the J-M Reef. The J-M Reef is similar to the Merensky Reef of the Bushveld complex of South Africa. It is a continuous layer near the base of the banded zone. It consists of one to three meter thick pegmatitic peridotite and troctolite with disseminated sulfide minerals. Common sulfides include pyrrhotite, pentlandite (containing up to 5% Pd), and chalcopyrite along with lesser amounts of moncheite ((Pt,Pd)(Te,Bi)2), cooperite ((Pt,Pd,Ni)S), braggite ((Pt,Pd,Ni)S), kotulskite (Pd(Te,Bi)1-2) and platinum-iron alloys. Overall the reef contains an average of 20-25 ppm platinum plus palladium in an average two meter thickness. It has a Pd/Pt ratio of about 3.6.

Its main proposal was the separation between the union movement and the political parties. The CGT was then dominated by anarcho-syndicalists who preferred the constitution of an alternate system through the elaboration of workers' union rather than moderate reforms through the electoral path. The motion for the Charter was drafted by Victor Griffuelhes, general secretary of the CGT, and √âmile Pouget. The Charter was adopted by 830 participants, 8 having voted \\"no\\" and 1 abstained, and marked the victory of the current of revolutionary syndicalism in the CGT of the time.  Aims  The Charter of Amiens assigned two aims to the workers' movement: the \\"defense of immediate and daily demands\\" and the \\"struggle for a global transformation of society in complete independence from political parties and from the state.\\" By this Charter, the CGT explicitly recognized class struggle. Immediate goals included reduction of worktime (the 8 hours day) and increase of wages. But the longer term goal was nothingless than \\"expropriation of the capitalists\\" through the means of a general strike. It considered the trade-union to be the future group of production and of social repartition and the basis for a social reorganization -- a main view of the syndicalism movement. Considering that all employees were submitted to the same exploitation and alienation, both material and spiritual, it stated that it was a duty for all of them to belong to a trade-union. This, in turn, was followed by the proclamation of the complete freedom for its members to choose the form of political struggle (and, therefore, any party membership) which it deemed the fitter. In exchange, it requested for the union member not to introduce in the union opinions which it professed outside.  Legacy  The Charter of Amiens has become a cornerstone of the unions' tradition in France and the guarantee of their autonomy from political parties, although after World War II and the creation of the social-democrat Force Ouvri√®re (FO) trade-union, close to the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and then to the French Socialist Party (PS), the CGT has maintained unofficial links with the French Communist Party (PCF). The CGT, FO, the Union nationale des syndicats autonomes (UNSA), the Union syndicale Solidaires, the Conf√©d√©ration nationale du travail (CNT), the FGAAC and the F√©d√©ration syndicale unitaire (FSU) today all claim as theirs the Charter of Amiens. The CNT-AIT, founded in 1922, is the only one to reject the Charter, alleging that by proclaiming an autonomy between trade-unions and political parties it organizes the submission of the workers' union to parties. Furthermore, the CNT-AIT -- French section of the International Workers Association (IWA) -- which qualifies itself as an anarchist communist organization, also criticizes the formulation according to which the trade-union will become the future cell of social organization: in its views, in the event of an overhaul of Capitalism, the trade-unions will be called to disappear lest they become organizations of control.La Charte d'Amiens est morte... , website of the CNT-AIT, 12 June 2006  See also  *Trade unions in France *History of the Left in France *International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam (1907, in particular Pierre Monatte's speech) *Politics of France *Anarchism in France ReferencesExternal links * Text of the Charter * Text of the Charter * Compte rendu st√©nographique du congr√®s d'Amiens (s√©ances concernant la question des rapports du syndicalisme et de la politique) * sommaire de Mil neuf cent.

The Fifth Labour Government introduced the Electoral Finance Bill partly in response to the 2005 New Zealand election funding controversy, in particular to \\"third-party\\" campaigns. The proponents of the bill generally held that such a law was required to prevent wealthy private parties from \\"buying elections\\" anonymously via advertising campaigns or other financially costly lobbying, while opponents considered it a serious restriction of civil liberties, and further regarded spending private money on political campaigning as a democratic right.  Effect  The Act amended numerous areas of New Zealand electoral law, but was repealed on 17 February 2009. Principally and most controversially it regulated \\"third party\\" election campaigns  Third party campaigns  The Act made it illegal for anyone to spend more than NZ$12,000 criticising or supporting a political party or taking a position on any political matter, or more than NZ$1,000 criticising or supporting an individual member of parliament, without first registering with a state agency, the Electoral Commission. The Bill as introduced required that unregistered third parties file statutory declarations before publishing election advertisements. The Bill originally limited the spending of registered third parties on political advertising to $60,000, but this was later increased to $120,000 by the Select Committee. The regulation of third parties also extends to their finances. The Act requires that third parties disclose all donations they receive over $5000. Anonymous donations that third parties receive over this level must be given to the State.  Regulated period  The Act extends the \\"regulated period\\" for election campaigning from the previous 90-day period to the period starting on 1 January of election year ‚Äì from three months to around ten, depending on the timing of the election. During this period electoral advertising by candidates, political parties and third parties must follow election rules, and spending limits apply.  Controversy  The Coalition for Open Government, a group that advocates the reform of election finance law in New Zealand, opposed parts of the Bill, particularly the failure of the Bill to ban secret donations to political parties, given the strong financial disclosure requirements placed on third parties. The broad definition of \\"election advertisement\\" came in for particular criticism. Critics, including the New Zealand Law Society, Catholic charity Caritas, and the Royal New Zealand Forest and Bird Society argued the definition will catch not just electoral speech, but almost all political speech ‚Äì including things like placards at protest marches. The parliamentary opposition, the National Party, also opposed the Bill. Political commentator Matthew Hooton argued that the Bill should not proceed, and that the Minister of Justice was a \\"danger to democracy\\". On 6 October 2007 the Free Speech Coalition was formed by prominent right-wing bloggers David Farrar and Cameron Slater, and Bernard Darnton, leader of the Libertarianz Party, to oppose the Bill. The New Zealand Anti-Vivisection Society and NORML New Zealand, and the Direct Democracy Party of New Zealand also opposed the Bill. Criticism has also been made over the process that led to the Bill's introduction, which involved discussions only with the Labour Government's supporting parties and not the Opposition. Political commentator Chris Trotter had harsh criticism of the detractors of the Act in several opinion pieces in The Dominion Post. On 17 August he wrote : \\"let's just take a deep breath and examine the rules that govern election spending in Britain and Canada (countries which, the last time I looked, were still counted among the world's leading democracies). In Britain, \\"third party\\" expenditure is capped at 5 per cent of the expenditure authorised for political parties in the 12 months prior to polling day. : In Canada the figure is 1 per cent, but applies only to the period of official campaigning. (Mr Burton is proposing a cap of 2.5 per cent or $60,000 for 10 months.) In both Britain and Canada, third parties are required to register with the official electoral regulators; both countries also restrict the contributions of foreign donors to third parties; and both require the identity of third party donors to be made public. That is how modern democracies conduct themselves. : But, in New Zealand, it is still acceptable (at least to the National Party) for those with the most money to have the most say.\\"  Protests  On 17 November 2007 a protest in Auckland against the Bill, organised by John Boscawen, drew over 2,000 protestors. A second Auckland protest, on 1 December 2007, drew a crowd of around 5,000. Smaller protests were held in Wellington and Christchurch.  Parliamentary process = Introduction  The Bill was introduced on 23 July 2007 by Minister of Justice Mark Burton, who said at its introduction \\"The package of reforms introduced to Parliament will help promote participation in parliamentary democracy, and aims to clean up New Zealand's electoral system and protect it from abuse.\\"  Bill of Rights  Under section 7 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, the Attorney-General must advise Parliament at the introduction of a bill if that bill is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. The Crown Law Office, which undertook the review, concluded that the Bill was consistent with the Bill of Rights. The National Business Review described Crown Law's opinion as \\"...one of the worst, most politically expedient calls on New Zealand human rights legislation in memory.\\"  First reading  The Bill passed its first reading on 27 July by 65 votes to 54, with the Labour, Greens, NZ First, United Future and Progressive voting in favour, and the National Party, MƒÅori Party and independents Gordon Copeland and Taito Phillip Field voting against. ACT did not vote. The legislation was sent to the Justice and Electoral Committee for consideration, with agreement from MPs to extend the membership of the committee for consideration of the Bill to include members from almost all Parliamentary parties. The committee's report on the Bill was due by 25 January 2008.  Select Committee  Public submissions on the Bill closed on 7 September 2007. Radio New Zealand reported on 31 August that the Government had indicated it might write to the Committee indicating that it intended to make unspecified changes to the parts of the legislation dealing with third parties. This would have prevented the committee from hearing criticism of the existing provisions and allow the Government to introduce changes during the Committee of the Whole House without the public being able to make submissions on the new provisions. Then Prime Minister Helen Clark denied this. Investigative journalist Nicky Hager, author of The Hollow Men, submitted in favour of the need for changes to New Zealand electoral law. The New Zealand Law Society, and the New Zealand Human Rights Commission submitted against the Bill. The Select committee reported the Bill to the House of Representatives on 18 November 2007, and recommended that the Bill proceed. Annette King, who became Minister of Justice following a Cabinet reshuffle on 31 October 2007, announced a number of changes to the Bill. These changes included: * Increasing the cap on total third party spending from $60,000 to $120,000; * Increasing the cap on election advertising before they have to register under the new law from $5,000 to $12,000; * Changing the definition of election advertising; * Increasing the corruption penalties to $100,000 fine.  Second reading  The Bill was put to a second reading vote on 22 November 2007. It passed by 65 votes to 54, with Labour, New Zealand First, the Greens, United Future, and the Progressive Party supporting it. National, ACT, the MƒÅori Party, and independents Gordon Copeland and Taito Phillip Field voted against it, the MƒÅori party voting two of its four votes in favour.  Committee of the whole House  The Committee of the whole House stage began on 3 December 2007.  Third reading  The Bill passed its third reading on 18 December 2007 by 63 votes to 57, with the National Party, the Maori Party, ACT, United Future and independent MP Taito Phillip Field voting against and Labour, the Greens, New Zealand First and Progressive voting for. Independent MP Gordon Copeland did not vote.  Royal Assent and eventual repeal  The Governor-General signed the Act into law on 19 December 2007. The Electoral Finance Act was repealed on 17 February 2009 by a vote in Parliament of 112 to 9. The Green Party was the only Party opposing the repeal, saying it should stay in force until a replacement Bill was prepared. Justice Minister Simon Power said during debate on the repeal bill that all parties in Parliament had agreed to take part in consultations to draft replacement electoral law. Until that happens, the 1993 Electoral Act will be in force with clauses of the EFA dealing with donation disclosure inserted.

The college was opened in 1968 and offers primarily associate degrees and some bachelor's degrees. The campus features The Clarion, regional musical performance venue, in addition to the Brazosport Center for the Arts and Sciences, which houses the Brazosport Museum of Natural Science as well as the Brazosport Planetarium among other institutions. As defined by the Texas Legislature, the official service area of Brazosport College is the Brazosport, Columbia-Brazoria, Damon, and Sweeny school districts, and the Angleton independent school District excluding that portion annexed by Alvin Community College prior to September 1, 1995.Texas Education Code, Section 130.170, \\"Brazosport College District Service Area\\". The service area includes most of Lake Jackson, Clute, Freeport, Jones Creek, Oyster Creek, Quintana, Richwood, and Surfside Beach. History In 1948, voters of the Brazosport independent school District voted to create the Brazosport Junior College District. However, not until the summer of 1967, after a tax was authorized by voters to maintain the college, was the college actually built. In the Fall of 1968, the college opened as Brazosport Junior College, and the first semester of classes began with an enrollment of 879 students.Student Guide & Calendar , Brazosport College, Retrieved August 12, 2007. Classes were held at the Brazosport Education Extension Center in Freeport, Texas. In 1970, Brazosport Junior College graduated its first 25 students. That same year, Brazosport Junior College was renamed to Brazosport College to represent a broader vision for the school. In 1996, President Millicent Valek was selected as the fourth president of the college. On June 20, 2003, then Texas Governor Rick Perry signed Senate Bill 286 of the 78th Legislature into law, which created the pilot project. The program allowed the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to choose Brazosport College along with Midland College, and South Texas College to offer baccalaureate degrees. In December 2004, Brazosport College received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as a baccalaureate-level institution. In the Fall of 2005, BC began offering classes for its Bachelor of Applied Technology degree program for the first time. In 2011, Brazosport College, along with Frank Phillips College in Borger, Ranger College in Ranger, and Odessa College in Odessa, were proposed for closure by the State of Texas. The Texas Association of Community Colleges rallied successfully to keep the four institutions open. In a letter to Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio and Jim Pitts of Waxahachie, then the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, TACC leaders referred to state budget restrictions at the time: > Community colleges are fully aware of the state's budget crisis, and we > understand that we will have to bear our share of the budget pain. We pledge > to work with you to reach a fair and equitable solution ... the decision to > close these four colleges is unfair and inequitable in that it appears to be > arbitrary and ill-advised.

Historically, most students have opted to attend classes at Brazosport College as a stepping stone to other colleges and universities that offer bachelor's degrees. BC participates in the Texas Common Course Numbering System, or TCCNS, a voluntary cooperative effort by many Texas colleges and universities to create a standard set of course designations for transfer students at the freshman and sophomore level. This allows students who wish to transfer courses taken at Brazosport College to take a relevant curriculum for their destination school. Another option for students at BC is to pursue an associate degree. Brazosport College generally graduates around 200 students annually.

He not only made a major contribution to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911‚Äì1914 but was also recruited for Sir Ernest Shackleton's \\"Endurance\\" Expedition; he fought with the infantry, the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force in both world wars and was wounded on no fewer than four separate occasions. According to his obituary in The Times, \\"His loyalty to his friends, his gallantry... and the unembittered courage with which he continued to meet the difficulties of a world which gave little recognition in peace to men of his mould ‚Äì leave to us who shared in one way or another his various life the memory of a rich, rewarding and abiding spirit\\". Bickerton was a friend of author Vita Sackville-West and was the model for the character of Leonard Anquetil in her 1930 novel The Edwardians. Early life Francis Howard Bickerton was born in Iffley, Oxfordshire, on 15 January 1889, the son of Joseph Jones Bickerton (1839‚Äì1894), liberal councillor and town clerk of Oxford, and his second wife Eliza Frances Fox (1849‚Äì1896).1891 Census of Headington District ‚Äì RG12/1166 Folio 49 Page 9 (Charley Hall, The Parks, Oxford) After the early deaths of both parents, Bickerton and his sister, Dorothea, became the wards of their maternal uncle, the neurologist Dr Edward Lawrence Fox (1859‚Äì1938), living at 9 Osborne Place in Plymouth, Devon. Bickerton received his early schooling from Joseph John Cross at Newton Abbot Hall before moving on to Marlborough College, where he boarded from 1901‚Äì1904. In 1906 he enrolled at London's City & Guilds (Technical) College where he became one of the college's first students to study aeronautical engineering. There is no record of Bickerton ever having formally graduated, but around 1910 he went to work in one of the iron foundries in Bedford and, while resident in that town, he met and became friends with the Antarctic explorer Aeneas Mackintosh (a veteran of Shackleton's Nimrod expedition). In March 1911 the two men embarked upon a treasure-hunting expedition to Cocos Island but returned empty-handed three months later. The Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE), 1911‚Äì1914 Immediately upon his return from Cocos Island, Bickerton volunteered for the Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Dr Douglas Mawson. Mawson had determined to take a Vicker's REP monoplane to undertake survey work and Bickerton was appointed as mechanical engineer with responsibility for the maintenance of this, the first powered aircraft in Antarctica. During a trial flight in Adelaide on 5 October 1911, however, the aeroplane crashed, slightly injuring the pilot, Hugh Watkins, and his passenger, Frank Wild. With the monoplane too badly damaged for further attempts at flight, Mawson ordered Bickerton to convert it into an \\"air-tractor\\" which would then be used for hauling supplies and for exploration during the expedition. The expedition ship, the Steam Yacht \\"Aurora\\" sailed from Hobart, Tasmania, on 2 December 1911. After dropping a small party on Macquarie Island in order to establish a wireless relay station, the \\"Aurora\\" sailed for the Antarctic on 23 December and reached Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, Antarctica on 8 January 1912. Over the next eleven months, Bickerton spent the majority of his time working on the conversion of the wrecked monoplane and on the erection of the two huge wireless masts intended to enable, for the first time in the history of Antarctic exploration, direct communication between an Antarctic base-camp and civilization. In October 1912, Bickerton was also chosen to lead one of the expedition's four main sledging parties. His particular task would be to steer the air-tractor along the western coast of Commonwealth Bay, accompanied by Dr Leslie Whetter and Alfred Hodgeman. Bickerton and his companions began their trek on 3 December 1912, with Bickerton piloting the heavily laden air-tractor and Whetter and Hodgeman proceeding on foot. Almost immediately, however, the machine became a cause for concern and, on the following day, the engine seized so abruptly that the propeller was smashed; with no spare-parts and with little or no time to effect repairs, the three men agreed to abandon the aeroplane and to proceed on foot. Despite this disappointment, the following day, 5 December, marked an important milestone in Antarctic science, with the discovery of a 1 kg olivine-hypersthene ‚Äì the first meteorite ever to be found in Antarctica. The discovery of the \\"Adelie Land Meteorite\\" would prove to be the first step in identifying Antarctica as the richest meteorite field on the face of the planet. Over the next few weeks, despite appalling weather conditions, Bickerton's three-man team man-hauled their sledges across approximately of previously unexplored territory, eventually returning to base-camp on 18 January 1913. The Western Sledging Party was the last-but-one to return: Douglas Mawson's Far-Eastern Sledging Party, consisting of Mawson, Belgrave Ninnis and Xavier Mertz, was still missing. It would eventually transpire that Ninnis had been killed by a fall down a crevasse and, with the loss of the bulk of their supplies on Ninnis's sledge, Mertz and Mawson had been forced to immediately embark on their return journey. During its course, however, Mertz had succumbed to exhaustion and starvation, leaving a malnourished Mawson to undertake a solitary trek of more than . By the time that Mawson reached base-camp in early February, the \\"Aurora\\" had been forced to depart in order to avoid being iced-in and a relief party of six men, including Bickerton, had been left behind to search for the missing sledgers. This party would remain in Antarctica until the ship's eventual return on 12 December 1913. For his services to Antarctic exploration, including his work on the continent's first propeller-driven sledge, his important contribution to establishing the first wireless link with Antarctica and his discovery of the first Antarctic meteorite, Bickerton was awarded the King's Polar Medal in silver and Mawson chose to name Cape Bickerton (6620S, 13656E, five miles (8 km) ENE of Gravenoire Rock) in his honor. Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914‚Äì1917 While still in Antarctica, Bickerton had learned about and volunteered for Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic (or \\"Endurance\\") Expedition. Shackleton intended to take a number of motor-driven sledges on his expedition, including one very similar in design to the converted REP monoplane. As the only man ever to have attempted the use of such a machine in Antarctica, Bickerton's expertise was second-to-none and his application was accepted. In May 1914, Bickerton accompanied Shackleton, Frank Wild, George Marston and Thomas Orde-Lees to Finse in Norway to test the propeller-sledge. Shortly after the party's return from Norway, Britain declared war on Germany and Bickerton decided to abandon any plans for a return to Antarctica and instead joined the Army. World War I On 11 September 1914, Bickerton enlisted with the 16th (Public Schools) Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. He soon applied for an officer's commission, however, and in April 1915, he joined the 7th (Service) Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment as a platoon commander in D Company under Captain G.H. Impey. The Battalion crossed to France on 31 May 1915 and a few days later took up a position near Armentieres on the River Leys. It was here, on 28 June, that the Battalion lost its first officer, Captain John Bussell, Bickerton's brother- in-law, being shot through the head during an inspection of the trenches. The Battalion then played a minor role in the Battle of Loos during September with most of its casualties being suffered by D Company. In May 1916, Bickerton volunteered to serve as an aerial gunner and observer with the Royal Flying Corps. Posted to 10 Squadron near Bethune, Bickerton served on BE2cs, acting as observer for an Australian pilot named Ewart Garland. This period formed the basis for the novel Wings of the Morning written by Patrick Garland, the theatre director and son of Ewart Garland. Throughout July 1916, 10 Squadron supported ground troops during the Battle of the Somme and on 31 July, Bickerton received his first wound of the war, a piece of shrapnel piercing his flying jacket and wounding him in the shoulder. On 16 August, he was injured again, far more seriously. With flying made impossible by low cloud cover, Bickerton and other officers experimented with a home-made anti- aircraft gun. During the experiments, the gun exploded, practically severing both of Bickerton's thumbs and tearing open his right cheek. From August 1916 to February 1917, Bickerton recuperated in England. He then attended the No 1 School of Military Aeronautics at Reading and the Central Flying School at Upavon in Wiltshire, where he trained as a pilot. After a brief spell as a temporary instructor at Upavon, he joined 70 Squadron at Estree Blanche on 21 July 1917. 70 Squadron was the first to be equipped with the notoriously difficult but hugely successful British fighter, the Sopwith Camel. In the following weeks, Bickerton and his colleagues saw constant action and Bickerton claimed two victories: an Albatros D on 22 August over Houthulst Forest and a Fokker triplane on 10 September over Roulers. It was also during this period (3 September) that Bickerton became one of the first men to use the Sopwith Camel as a night-fighter. Finally, on 20 September, during an attack on three barrage balloons, he was again seriously wounded by a bullet which passed through his thigh and amputated the little finger of his left hand. As a result, Bickerton was again invalided home. Bickerton's final injuries of the war were suffered in May 1918, when he was serving as a test pilot at the Aeroplane Experimental Station at Martlesham Heath in Suffolk. On 18 May, he was testing bomb-aiming equipment in a Vicker's Vimy bomber. When the aeroplane suffered simultaneous failure in both its engines, forcing Bickerton to attempt a crash-landing. The resulting smash destroyed the aeroplane and left Bickerton with concussion and broken fingers. Post-War In 1920, Bickerton joined fellow Antarctic veterans, Frank Wild and Dr James McIlroy, on an expedition to East Africa. Having heard what Wild called \\"wondrous accounts of the possibility of making rapid and colossal fortunes in Portuguese East Africa by growing tobacco\\", the three men planned to become farmers. Having found the Portuguese authorities \\"impossible\\" they moved on to Fort Johnstone in British Nyasaland where they cleared of forest. During this process, however, Bickerton contracted malaria and was forced to return to Europe. Having spent some time in Paris with his friend, the artist Cuthbert Orde, he travelled in Newfoundland, where he joined a colony of ex-pats established by Antarctic veteran Captain Victor Campbell. During the late 1920s, Bickerton regularly travelled between Newfoundland and England, combining the lives of a Canadian backwoodsman with that of a fashionable party-goer in the London of the Roaring Twenties. It was during this period that the novelists Stella Benson and Vita Sackville-West both became acquainted with the explorer. The former fell passionately in love with Bickerton and asked him to become the father of her child (an honour which Bickerton declined), while the latter took Bickerton as the model for Leonard Anquetil, the hero of her best novel, The Edwardians (1930). In 1928, Bickerton abandoned his farm in Newfoundland and decided to invest capital in a company founded by the American equestrian and golfing champion, Marion Hollins. Ultimately, he would become heavily involved in the development of the Pasatiempo Country Club in Santa Cruz, working closely with both Hollins and the world-famous golf-course designer, Dr Alister MacKenzie. It was also during this period that Bickerton commenced what would ultimately become a disastrous love-affair with Marion Hollins's niece, Hope Hollins. The acrimonious break-up of the affair saw Bickerton quarrel with his business partner and, with the onset of the Wall Street Crash, he eventually fled the US and returned to England, a disillusioned and unhappy man. During 1932‚Äì1933, Bickerton embarked on a world tour in company with William Rhodes-Moorhouse and Tom Hanbury. Having travelled from England to New York and then through British Columbia shooting grizzly bear, the trio sailed from the East Coast of America to South Africa on board a cargo ship. They then travelled by train, plane and automobile from Cape Town to Cairo, frequently pausing to hunt. Back in England, Bickerton took up a role within the film industry, working as screenwriter and film-editor on a range of films, including My Irish Molly with Maureen O'Hara and an adaptation of Jack London's Mutiny of the Elsinore with the future Oscar-winner Paul Lukas. On 27 May 1937, Bickerton married Lady Joan Chetwynd-Talbot, sister of the Earl of Shrewsbury, by whom he had one daughter. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Bickerton immediately volunteered for service and was sent to France with the air contingent of the British Expeditionary Force. He served with distinction throughout the war, ending with the rank of Wing Commander, mentioned-in-despatches. Frank Bickerton died on 21 August 1954 in the Welsh town of Borth, Cardiganshire.

He also did the art for Sword of the Dark Ones. His real name is unknown; his title name is rather a pen name, majorly derived from animator Tsukasa Dokite. In 2003, he attended Otakon as a guest. Biography Around the age of nine and attending fourth grade, Tsukasa was introduced to anime with the initial series of Mobile Suit Gundam, and was further inspired to go into anime upon the release of Mobile Suit Z Gundam in his second year of middle school. After going to his first Comiket, by the time of 1985, Tsukasa began his career as a manga artist through dojinshi circles, particularly through junior high and high school fanzine anthologies under the initial pseudonym . His current pseudonym is derived from the pronunciations of the individual kanji that make up the compound for the Japanese word for \\"sushi.\\" His talents and connections with editors during his high school career allowed him to land work with illustrations for commercial design and general staff work for anime studios and manga circles; by the age of twenty, he became an apprentice of Kenichi Sonoda. After his apprenticeship in 1994, his friend Masami Obari, whose then current projects were that of the Fatal Fury OVA movies, let him work on staff as the off action wardrobe and character designer for Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture. Inspiration and Style His art style is largely influenced particularly from series Mobile Suit Gundam and Megazone 23, and fellow superiors in the industry, such as Tsukasa Dokite, Masamune Shirow, Masakazu Katsura, Kenichi Sonoda, and Masami Obari. Tsukasa's 1990s anime style works are defined as wild, making the use of vivid colors and soft but stark contrasting shades, and somewhat exaggerated features of human anatomy along with realistic features, including that of puffed up cheeks, which he helped launch into popularity as they were in style at the time for defining cute characters and aesthetics. Into the current day, his style is defined by more subdued but more flowing coloring and an emphasis on darker and thicker lining work. Personal life Outside of work in the anime industry, Tsukasa is a lifelong fan of Gundam and video games, particularly of King of Fighters and Pok√©mon. He occasionally does doujinshi in his spare time, sometimes of adult oriented parodies, under different pseudonyms, such as Noriharu or Gym Leader. Works=Manga *Go! Go!

Biography Born in Christchurch on 31 March 1908, Thompson was the son of Ellen and Frederick Thompson. A member of the Avon Rowing Club, he began rowing in 1926. Thompson represented New Zealand at the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Ontario. He was a member of the men's eight that won the silver medal, finishing three-quarters of a length behind the victorious English crew. At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Thompson was a member of the New Zealand crews in the men's coxless pair and the men's eight. Partnered with Cyril Stiles in the coxless pair, he progressed to the final via the rep√™chage, and went on to win the silver medal. They finished half a length behind the gold medal crew from Great Britain after breaking a stay on the stroke rigger 600 m from the end of the race. The New Zealand eight was eliminated in the rep√™chage. Thompson again competed for New Zealand in the men's eight at the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney, where he was a member of the bronze medal-winning crew. Thompson worked as a tanner at the Woolston Tanneries in Christchurch, where he was involved in a serious accident in July 1943. He caught his left arm in a machine used for stripping hides, and it took 45 minutes for him to be extricated. His arm was later amputated at Christchurch Hospital. He later became a greengrocer. Despite his accident, Thompson continued his involvement with the Avon Rowing Club, and coached David and Humphrey Gould, who won the silver medal in the coxless pair at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland. Thompson died on 15 December 1971, and he was buried at Ruru Lawn Cemetery, Christchurch.

The film made its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2007 under the name Nothing Is Private. The film, like the book, touches on issues of sexual awakening, privacy, and race. Plot Set in 1990 amid the Kuwait War of 1990‚Äì1991, Towelhead tells the coming-of-age story of a 13-year-old Lebanese American girl named Jasira (Summer Bishil). She first lives with her mother in Syracuse, New York, but when her mother's live-in boyfriend helps Jasira shave her pubic hair, her mother sends Jasira to live with her old-fashioned and domineering Lebanese father Rifat (Peter Macdissi) in suburban Houston, Texas. Jasira is treated as a second class citizen by her overprotective father. He is strict, does not allow her to use tampons, and prefers spending time with his new girlfriend, Thena. Even her mother refuses to support her when she calls and begs for help, forcing Jasira to comply with his rules. Her father acts very disrespectfully towards her and berates her for the slightest thing. Jasira experiences a sexual awakening at her neighbor's home, which is sparked in part by adult magazines she finds when baby-sitting the next-door neighbor boy Zack Vuoso (Chase Ellison), son of Travis Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart). While Jasira is home alone one night, Mr. Vuoso comes over to retrieve one of his magazines and sexually assaults her. Jasira befriends a classmate, Thomas Bradley (Eugene Jones), eventually becoming sexually active with him. When Rifat finds out about her relationship with Thomas, he forbids her from ever seeing him, only because he is black. Mr. Vuoso becomes jealous of Jasira's relationship with Thomas, and, pretending he has to go to Iraq the next morning, tricks Jasira into sleeping with him. When Rifat finds one of Mr. Vuoso's adult magazines at his house, he beats Jasira, and she seeks refuge at the home of Melina (Toni Collette) (who is pregnant) and her husband, Gil, neighbors who were aware of and concerned about Mr. Vuoso's inappropriate behavior towards Jasira from the beginning. While staying at their house, Gil notices bruises on Jasira's legs and Rifat angrily knocks on the door wanting to retrieve his daughter. When both Melina and Gil refuse to let Rifat in, he threatens to call the police and claim that they kidnapped his daughter, but Gil responds to Rifat that he will tell them about the bruises he left on Jasira. She goes to school the next day and Melina picks her up, along with Thomas. When they make it back home, they decide to have sex, but are almost caught by Melina. Later, Rifat visits the couple along with Thena. He notices Thomas is in the house and angrily confronts him. He also reveals why he despises him. He then decides to check the house and discovers a condom in the trash. He assumes Thomas is responsible for taking his daughter's virginity and attempts to assault him. This forces Jasira to confess that she had sex with Mr. Vuoso, who is then arrested and bailed out the next day. Thomas talks with Jasira about her abuse from Mr. Vuoso, and explains that he doesn't want to have sex with her anymore. She says she does not want to stop. One day after school, Jasira retrieves the corpse of Travis' cat, which ran off after she came by his house and was accidentally run over by Rifat on his way home. When Melina sees Jasira talking to Mr. Vuoso, she runs outside to stop the conversation, but trips and falls down on the ground, which causes her to bleed and go into labor. While at the hospital, Rifat is asked by Jasira to accompany Melina in the delivery room, since her husband won't make it in time. When Rifat refuses to stay, he finally decides to trust Jasira and let her stay and live with Melina, which makes her very happy. He leaves the delivery room and Jasira witnesses Melina giving birth to a baby girl. CastCritical reception Towelhead received mixed reviews from critics; Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 5.36/10. The consensus reads, \\"This story of politics, race and sexual awakening has moments that pack a punch, but overall, Towelhead never quite achieves the nuance of helmer Alan Ball's television work.\\" The film also holds a score of 57 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 31 reviews.

It is used to isolate the impact of goaltending performance. By comparing the number of goals allowed to the total of the Shot Quality figures for each shot against, a goaltender can be rated relative to average performance across the league. As a theoretical example, if a wrist shot from 15 feet at even strength resulted in a goal 15% of the time, it would be assigned a Shot Quality of 0.15. If a goaltender faced ten such shots in a game, then they would be expected to yield 1.5 goals (10 * 0.15). Comparing actual results against the Expected Goals figure of 1.5 yields a measure of goaltending performance that is somewhat isolated from the effects of the other players on the ice. The concept was first publicly presented in a paper by Alan Ryder of Hockey Analytics, and has since been utilized in slightly varying fashion by a number of blog-based hockey analysts such as the Forechecker at On The Forecheck, and JavaGeek at Hockey Numbers.

It aired on Wednesdays at 2pm and ran from 2007 to late 2012. The show covered a broad range of topics from the mundane to news and current affairs. The show was renowned for its high quality, ever-changing musical intro, which included sound-bites from movies and television from the 2000s (decade). Hosts=Ando Ando is the longest standing member of The Mandogs, and has been a host since the show began in 2007. Ando's style frequently poses hypothetical situations, usually regarding a moral dilemma, to cohosts and guests. Billiam Billiam joined The Mandogs in 2008, he has a pun-related style of comedy and regularly makes jokes regarding the Spanish, Chinese and English languages. Billiam often makes passing or in- depth references to video games and other aspects of geek culture. Dexter Dexter, also joined The Mandogs in 2008. Originally Dexter was employed as the show's technical producer, but since then he has gradually become equally as vocal as the other hosts. Fans of the show often comment about the soothing nature of Dexter's voice. Agent Orange Agent Orange was a host during the first years of The Mandogs being on air. In 2009 he left the show but has since returned in August 2011. The Recruit The most recent addition to the show, recruited in 2012. The Recruit adds a certain \\"life\\" to the show, especially in his quoting of the text line number and his injection of scientific \\"facts.\\" Jay-Jay Jay-Jay strolled into the studio and instantly commanded the attention of the mandogs; with his suave combination of mustache and turtle neck sweater the other hosts immediately decided that Jay-Jay was needed to add a certain \\"class\\" to the show.  2010 Reformatting  Prior to 2010, the Mandogs consisted largely of planned or pre-recorded content, including radio serial The Hunt for Building 66. In the first show of 2010 the Mandogs announced a format change away from highly planned, pre-recorded content to a more relaxed and casual style. The Mandogs have suggested multiple reasons for this, including demands by Radio Monash administration for a more approachable style, or because the hosts were \\"spending multiple hours of preparation for 5 minutes of content\\". Whereas previously The Mandogs' shows would be fast-paced with multiple breaks, the shows are now more relaxed, based around comedic observations and general banter. On May 24, 2010, Dexter attempted to beat the world record for most Ferrero Rocher chocolates eaten in one minute live on air. Although he was not successful The Mandogs suggested that there may be other record attempts in later shows. Regular Guests Since the formatting The Mandogs have had at least one guest host per episode. Regular guests include:  Dr. Yik  Dr. Yik has appeared on various Mandogs episodes throughout its history. It has never been made certain what field Dr. Yik is an expert in, and is frequently suggested that he is not a doctor at all. Dr. Yik is generally asked for his \\"expert opinion\\" on various topics, and his replies often contain a level of sarcasm.  Ash \\"The Lion Man\\" Lyons  Another long-time guest on the show, Ash is often criticised by the other hosts for his irrational or badly considered ideas. Listeners are frequently reminded not to take his advice and that \\"in a zombie outbreak Ash would be screwed\\", a reference to an episode in which Ash advised listeners to roam the desert in a hypothetical 'zombie' scenario.  Mintberry Jess  Mintberry Jess first appeared following the show being reformatted. This may have been by request of the station management to include more female influence on the show. Jess often provides a contrast to the other panelists' typically nerdy style of humour. Dr. Law Dr. Law first joined the show in May 2012, after the team contacted him for legal advice; the panel decided the best course of action was for him to join them on air to prevent them getting in too much trouble. Dunco Dunco injected his wholesome humour and down to earth goodness into the mandogs panel in late April 2012; he is, reportedly, the sort of person you would love to have a beer with (in moderation) Chook Chook, similarly to Dunco, joined the mandogs team in late April 2012. Chook was added to the panel after the hosts decided a rugged and manly host was needed to attract more female listeners. Evan Handed Evan Handed first appeared on the show in late September, 2012. He attempts to create political satire and resembles Simon Pegg.

The mission of the program is to educate individuals to become outstanding clinicians and to foster leaders who will serve their communities and advance the physician assistant (PA) profession. The program's founder, Dr. Alfred M. Sadler Jr., served as its first director in 1970. Yale School of Medicine maintains the only PA program named \\"Physician Associate\\" program instead of a \\"Physician Assistant\\" program in the United States, as it pre-dates the formation of the accreditation body and has elected to retain its original name. Note that despite the difference in name, graduates of the program will take the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam and will be called a physician assistant when practicing. Academics Completion of the 28 month curriculum results in award of a master's degree. The education is divided into two portions (a didactic and clinical phase). The faculty of the Yale School of Medicine provides the education, which is coordinated by the Physician Associate program core faculty. The didactic year includes clinical and basic sciences as well as courses in research methods, ethics and physical examination. The clinical phase is fifteen months in duration with thirteen one month rotations and two months for research. Yale University requires all graduates to complete an original thesis under the mentorship of the School of Medicine faculty. Many graduates have pursued this research topic through a Yale Downs fellowship. This fellowship provides the student with an opportunity to act out his/her ideas in an international underserved setting. The PA program offers a joint degree (MMSc/MPH) with the Yale School of Public Health. In 2015 rankings by US News of the Best Physicians Assistant Program, Yale was ranked #20 with Midwestern University, Northeastern University, Rosalind Franklin University, and University of Southern California. In 2013 James (Jim) Van Rhee began as program director after previously having that position at Northwestern University. This leadership change has ushered in an innovative era at the PA program with enhanced use of technology and problem based learning. In 2015 the program received national headline as they began development of a distance learning format for medical education. This program development has not been without controversy as alumni have expressed concern over increased enrollment and the merits of distance education. The development of this program is potentially delayed as the PA accreditation body identified class expansion occurred too recently for the Yale PA program. International The PA program keeps with the Yale University global focus and encourages students to study internationally. The program currently has clinical sites in Uganda, Peru, Central America, and the UK. In recent years students have studied in five continents, and faculty are frequently consulted in the global development of PA and medical education. Admissions Acceptance is extremely selective. The common application for PA schools is used by Yale. The PA program receives over 1000 applicants for approximately 40 seats. Alumni Alumni have found their way into influential positions within the healthcare system. Many graduates are in leadership positions within medicine and beyond. Several past presidents of the AAPA are Yale PA Alumni.

It is frequently used by people with diabetes and those with hypoglycaemia to raise their blood glucose when it becomes dangerously low. Hypoglycaemia occurs when blood sugar levels drop too low; it can cause a variety of symptoms including hunger, sweating, rapid heart rate, and shaking. If left untreated, hypoglycaemia can lead to a loss of consciousness. Onset of hypoglycaemia can be sudden, requiring glucose levels to be normalised by consuming carbohydrates. Diabetics are generally recommended to carry 15 grams of glucose with them at all times.  Use  Oral glucose gel is used to raise dangerously low blood glucose concentration or blood glucose that has dropped too low for the person's adaptive compensatory mechanisms to cope with. The gel may be self-administered or given by an Emergency Medical Technician or paramedic responding to a hypoglycaemic emergency. As glucose molecules will absorb directly through oral tissue, the gel is either swallowed directly or allowed to stay in the mouth momentarily to facilitate rapid absorption via various areas of the mouth cavity and then swallowed to allow absorption into the blood via the small intestine.  Effectiveness  Although oral glucose gel is often recommended to diabetics, including by medical providers and organisations such as Diabetes UK, its efficacy in treating hypoglycaemia has been questioned. A 1978 study demonstrated poor absorption through the oral mucosa, and concluded that such gels have therapeutic value only when swallowed by the patient. A study published in the journal Diabetes Care found administration of glucagon a superior treatment for hypoglycaemia compared to oral glucose gel, with those receiving glucagon injections experiencing a significantly greater increase in mean capillary glucose concentration. The American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council recommend against the use of oral gels, in favour of more effective treatments such as glucagon injections or glucose tablets.http://www.instructorscorner.org/media/resources/SAC/Advisory%20Glucose%20for%20Diabetes%20Final%20for%20Posting%20%201_7_12.pdf A 2013 Cochrane Review concluded glucose gels were an effective treatment for neonatal hypoglycaemia; a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published by the same authors drew the same conclusion. However, a systematic review in 2016 found faults with the initial Cochrane review, including the possibility of bias due to the small number of studies analysed and poor evidence many of these studies offered, calling for further randomised control trials to be undertaken.  Products  Oral glucose gel usually is found in single-use tubes providing a dose of 15 grams of glucose, or resealable tubes with a total of 45 grams of glucose. It is often fruit-flavoured. Available brands include Glucogel in the United Kingdom, and GlucoBurst and Insta- Glucose in the United States.

The story, only 4.5 pages long in paperback, tells of the exploits of Alderic, Knight of the Order of the City, to seek and purloin the fabled hoard of precious gems rumoured to be held in the castle of the Gibbelins. These strange creatures live in a land chained to the Earth across the river ocean, and they have a built a tower at the narrowest point to attract humans, on whom they feed. Alderic, acting on conflicting advice, captures a dragon and rides upon it to the riverbank. He swims the river, spends the night breaking into the supposed treasure-cellar with a mighty pickaxe, and finds the gems. But the Gibbelins immediately find, capture, and kill him; Dunsany ends the story quite abruptly at this point, saying \\"the tale is one of those that have not a happy ending.\\" External links * Project Gutenberg text * * Category:1912 short stories Category:Fantasy short stories Category:Short stories by Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany Category:Works originally published in The Sketch ","title":"The Hoard of the Gibbelins"},{"id":"12746390","text":"Ian Roy Ballinger (21 October 1925 - 24 December 2008) was a New Zealand shooter who won a bronze medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

The coup was the culmination of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam. Discontent with the Di·ªám regime had been simmering below the surface, and exploded with mass Buddhist protests against long-standing religious discrimination after the government shooting of protesters who defied a ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) had launched a bloody overnight siege on Gia Long Palace in Saigon. When rebel forces entered the palace, Di·ªám and his adviser and younger brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon. The brothers had kept in communication with the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing that they were still in the palace. The Ng√¥ brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters near T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the Ng√¥ brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung and on Major D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ng√¥s' corpses surfaced in the media. Background alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. Di·ªám's political career began in July 1954, when he was appointed the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by former Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, who was Head of State. At the time, Vietnam had been partitioned at the Geneva Conference after the defeat of the French Union forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, with the State of Vietnam ruling the country south of the 17th parallel north. The partition was intended to be temporary, with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation. In the meantime, Di·ªám and B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i were locked in a power struggle. B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i disliked Di·ªám but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid. The issue was brought to a head when Di·ªám scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic. Di·ªám won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.Jacobs, pp. 83‚Äì85 Di·ªám refused to hold the reunification elections, on the basis that the State of Vietnam was not a signatory to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Di·ªám the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers.Jacobs, p. 86. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.Jacobs, pp. 111‚Äì114. Di·ªám kept the control of the nation firmly within the hands of his brothers and their in-laws and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Di·ªám; in 1960, a paratroop revolt was quashed after Di·ªám stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 palace bombing by two Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots failed to kill him.Jacobs, p. 141 South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Di·ªám's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform.Jacobs, p. 96 In the countryside, Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corv√©e labour.Jacobs, p. 91 Discontent with Di·ªám and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Di·ªám's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.Jacobs, pp. 142‚Äì145 In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively invoked; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, Di·ªám's elder brother. The Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Di·ªám remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. The key turning point came shortly after midnight on 21 August, when Nhu's Special Forces raided and vandalised Buddhist pagodas across the country, arresting thousands of monks and causing a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds.Jacobs, pp. 140‚Äì153 Numerous coup plans had been explored by the army before, but the plotters intensified their activities with increased confidence after the administration of US President John F. Kennedy authorised the US embassy to explore the possibility of a leadership change.Jacobs, pp. 157‚Äì168 Surrender and debate At 13:30 on 1 November, Generals D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n, respectively the Presidential Military Adviser and Army Chief of Staff, led a coup against Di·ªám. The rebels had carefully devised plans to neutralise loyalist officers to prevent them from saving Di·ªám. Unknown to Di·ªám, General ƒê√≠nh, the supposed loyalist who commanded the ARVN III Corps that surrounded the Saigon area, had allied himself with the plotters of the coup.Jones, pp. 409‚Äì11. The second of Di·ªám's most trusted loyalist generals was Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao, who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta. Di·ªám and Nhu were aware of the coup plan, and Nhu responded by planning a counter-coup, which he called Operation Bravo. This plan involved ƒê√≠nh and Colonel Tung, the loyalist commander of the Special Forces, staging a phony rebellion before their forces crushed the \\"uprising\\" to reaffirm the power of the Ng√¥ family. Unaware that ƒê√≠nh was plotting against him, Nhu allowed ƒê√≠nh to organise troops as he saw fit, and ƒê√≠nh transferred the command of the 7th Division based at M·ªπ Tho from Cao's IV Corps to his own III Corps. This allowed Colonel Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥, ƒê√≠nh's deputy, to take command of the 7th Division. The transfer allowed the rebels to completely encircle the capital and denied Cao the opportunity of storming Saigon and protecting Di·ªám, as he had done during the previous coup attempt in 1960. Minh and ƒê√¥n had invited senior Saigon based officers to a meeting at the headquarters of the Joint General Staff (JGS), on the pretext of routine business. Instead, they announced that a coup was underway, with only a few, including Tung, refusing to join. Tung was later forced at gunpoint to order his loyalist Special Forces to surrender. The coup went smoothly as the rebels quickly captured all key installations in Saigon and sealed incoming roads to prevent loyalist forces from entering. This left only the Presidential Guard to defend Gia Long Palace. The rebels attacked government and loyalist army buildings but delayed the attack on the palace, hoping that Di·ªám would resign and accept the offer of safe passage and exile. Di·ªám refused, vowing to reassert his control. After sunset, the 5th Division of Colonel Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, who later became the nation's president, led an assault on Gia Long Palace and it fell by daybreak.Jones, pp. 412‚Äì15. In the early morning of 2 November, Di·ªám agreed to surrender. The ARVN officers had intended to exile Di·ªám and Nhu, having promised the Ng√¥ brothers safe passage out of the country. At 06:00, just before dawn, the officers held a meeting at JGS headquarters to discuss the fate of the Ng√¥ brothers. According to Lucien Conein, the US Army and CIA officer who was the American liaison with the coup, most of the officers, including Minh, wanted Di·ªám to have an \\"honorable retirement\\" from office, followed by exile. Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting, with having already left to make arrangements for the arrival of Di·ªám and Nhu at JGS headquarters. General L√™, a former police chief under Di·ªám in the mid-1950s, strongly lobbied for Di·ªám's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the meeting, and L√™ attracted only minority support. One general was reported to have said \\"To kill weeds, you must pull them up at the roots\\".Hammer, p. 297. Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was in their minds, since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition.Jones, pp. 416‚Äì17. Minh and ƒê√¥n asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country. Two days earlier, US Ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., had alerted Washington that such a request was likely and recommended Saigon as the departure point. This request put the Kennedy administration in a difficult position, as the provision of an airplane would publicly tie it to the coup. When Conein telephoned David Smith, the acting chief of the Saigon CIA station, there was a ten-minute delay. The US government would not allow the aircraft to land in any country, unless that state was willing to grant asylum to Di·ªám. The United States did not want Di·ªám and Nhu to form a government in exile and wanted them far away from Vietnam. Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman had written in August that \\"under no circumstances should the Nhus be permitted to remain in Southeast Asia in close proximity to Vietnam because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power. If the generals decide to exile Di·ªám, he should also be sent outside Southeast Asia.\\"Hammer, p. 294. He further went on to anticipate what he termed a \\"G√∂tterd√§mmerung in the palace\\". After surrendering, Di·ªám called Lodge by telephone for the last time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Di·ªám spoke for the last time around 07:00 on 2 November moments after Di·ªám surrendered. When Di·ªám called, Lodge \\"put [him] on hold\\" and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Di·ªám and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the Philippines until the next day. This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Di·ªám to not resist the coup.Moyar, p. 271. Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, \\"We just can't get that involved.\\"Winters, p. 104. Dunn said, \\"I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them.\\"Moyar, p. 272. Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, \\"What would we have done with them if they had lived? Every Colonel Blimp in the world would have made use of them.\\" Dunn also claimed that Lodge put Di·ªám on hold in order to inform Conein where the Ng√¥ brothers were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Di·ªám and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane would have to go directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Di·ªám for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a US Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: \\"One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day.\\" The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Di·ªám to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that \\"when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Di·ªám to give up at a time when the outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive.\\" Intended arrest at Gia Long Palace In the meantime, Minh left the JGS headquarters and traveled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan with his aide and bodyguard, Captain Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung. Minh arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military ceremonial uniform to supervise the arrest of Di·ªám and Nhu. Minh had also dispatched an M113 armored personnel carrier and four jeeps to Gia Long Palace to transport an arrested Di·ªám and Nhu back to JGS headquarters for official surrender. While Minh was on the way to supervise the takeover of the palace, Generals ƒê√¥n, Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m and L√™ VƒÉn Kim prepared the army headquarters for Di·ªám's arrival and a ceremonial handover of power to the junta. Di·ªám's pictures were taken down and his statue was covered up. A large table covered with green felt was brought in with the intention of seating Di·ªám for the handover to Minh and Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°, who was to become the civilian Prime Minister. In a nationally televised event witnessed by international media, Di·ªám would \\"ask\\" the generals that he and his brother be granted exile and asylum in a foreign country, which would be granted. The brothers were then to be held in a secure place at JGS headquarters while awaiting deportation. Di·ªám's escape alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black- haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. Minh instead arrived to find that the brothers were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 on the night of the coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Di·ªám and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant √ê·ªó Th∆°, Di·ªám's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xu√¢n Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth.Hammer, p. 293. After the coup, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam General Paul Harkins, inspected the tunnel and noted that it \\"was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing\\". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif (), the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citro√´n sedan.Karnow, p. 323. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Di·ªám that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Di·ªám was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that \\"You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you.\\" Another story holds that Di·ªám said \\"We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?\\" Nhu agreed to remain with his brother. The loyalists reached the home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese business district of Cholon. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who was reported to be Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders.Jones, p. 418. Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Di·ªám and Nhu had escaped during the night. Arrest in Cholon thumb A pew in the church is marked with a small plaque identifying the spot where President Ngo Dinh Diem was seized after taking refuge here with his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu on 2 November 1963, after fleeing the Presidential Palace. After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc Th·∫£o was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Th·∫£o was told by Khi√™m, his superior, to locate Di·ªám and prevent him from being killed.Hammer, p. 292. When Th·∫£o arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Di·ªám and Nhu overheard him and Th∆° drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier (), which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Th∆° died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Th∆° recorded Di·ªám's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \\"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\\". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ng√¥ brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.Jones, p. 428. A few minutes later, just after 10:00, an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building. Lieutenant Th∆°, who had earlier urged Di·ªám to surrender, saying that he was sure that his uncle ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u, along with ƒê√≠nh and Khi√™m, would guarantee their safety, wrote in his diary later \\"I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death\\". Convoy to JGS headquarters The convoy was led by General Mai H·ªØu Xu√¢n and consisted of Colonels Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Quan and D∆∞∆°ng Ng·ªçc L·∫Øm. Quan was the deputy of Minh and L·∫Øm was the Commander of the Civil Guard. L·∫Øm had joined the coup once a rebel victory seemed assured. Two further officers made up the convoy: Major D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a and Captain Nhung, Minh's bodyguard.Hammer, pp. 297‚Äì98. Di·ªám requested that the convoy stop at the palace so that he could gather personal items before being exiled. Xu√¢n turned him down, clinically stating that his orders were to take Di·ªám and Nhu directly to JGS headquarters. Nhu expressed disgust that they were to be transported in an APC, asking, \\"You use such a vehicle to drive the president?\\" L·∫Øm assured them that the armour was for their own protection. Xu√¢n said that it was selected to protect them from \\"extremists\\". Xu√¢n ordered the brothers' hands be tied behind their backs before shoving them into the carrier. One officer asked to shoot Nhu, but Xu√¢n turned him down.Jones, p. 429. Assassination After the arrest, Nhung and Nghƒ©a sat with the brothers in the APC, and the convoy departed for T√¢n S∆°n Nh·∫•t. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh was reported to have gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by ƒê√¥n determined that Nghƒ©a had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi- automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.Karnow, p. 326. Nghƒ©a gave his account of what occurred during the journey back to the military headquarters: \\"As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Di·ªám sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [Nhung] began to insult each other. I don't know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion.\\" Nghƒ©a said that when the convoy reached a train crossing, \\"[Nhung] lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Di·ªám, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Di·ªám nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.\\" Attempted cover- up When the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters, the generals were shocked. Although they despised and had no sympathy for Nhu, they still respected Di·ªám. One general broke down and wept while Minh's assistant, Colonel Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Quan collapsed on a table. General ƒê√≠nh later declared, \\"I couldn't sleep that night\\". ƒê√¥n maintained that the generals were \\"truly grievous\\" over the deaths, maintaining that they were sincere in their intentions to give Di·ªám a safe exile. ƒê√¥n charged Nhu with convincing Di·ªám to reject the offer. Lodge later concluded, \\"Once again, brother Nhu proves to be the evil genius in Di·ªám's life.\\" ARVN reaction ƒê√¥n ordered another general to tell reporters that the Ng√¥ brothers had died in an accident. He went to confront Minh in his office. *ƒê√¥n: Why are they dead? *Minh: And what does it matter that they are dead? At this time, Xu√¢n walked into Minh's office through the open door, unaware of ƒê√¥n's presence. Xu√¢n snapped to attention and stated, \\"Mission accomplished.\\" Shortly after midnight on 2 November 1963 in Washington, D.C. the CIA sent word to the White House that Di·ªám and Nhu were dead, allegedly by suicide. Vietnam Radio had announced their deaths by poison, and that they had committed suicide while prisoners in an APC transporting them to T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t. Unclear and contradictory stories abounded. General Harkins reported that the suicides had occurred either by gunshot or by a grenade wrestled from the belt of an ARVN officer who was standing guard. Minh tried to explain the discrepancy, saying \\"Due to an inadvertence, there was a gun inside the vehicle. It was with this gun that they committed suicide.\\"Jones, p. 425. US reaction Lucien Conein, the CIA's contact with the ARVN generals Kennedy learned of the deaths on the following morning when National Security Council staffer Michael Forrestal rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ng√¥ brothers' alleged suicides. According to General Maxwell Taylor, \\"Kennedy leaped to his feet and rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before.\\" Kennedy had planned that Di·ªám would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that Kennedy was \\"somber and shaken\\". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was \\"particularly abhorrent\\" and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that \\"It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam.\\"Moyar, p. 276. When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ng√¥ brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied \\"No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country.\\" Kennedy's reaction did not draw sympathy from his entire administration. Some believed that he should not have supported the coup and that as coups were uncontrollable, assassination was always a possibility. Kennedy was skeptical about the story and suspected that a double assassination had taken place. He reasoned the devoutly Catholic Ng√¥ brothers would not have taken their own lives, but Roger Hilsman rationalised the possibility of suicide by asserting that Di·ªám and Nhu would have interpreted the coup as Armageddon.Jones, p. 427. US officials soon became aware of the true reasons for the deaths of Di·ªám and Nhu. Lucien Conein had left the rebel headquarters as the generals were preparing to bring in the Ng√¥ brothers for the press conference which announced the handover of power. Upon returning to his residence, Conein received a phone call from Saigon's CIA station that ordered him to report to the embassy. The embassy informed Conein that Kennedy had instructed him to find Di·ªám. Conein returned to T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t at around 10:30. The following conversation was reported: *Conein: Where were Diem and Nhu? *Minh: They committed suicide. They were in the Catholic Church at Cholon, and they committed suicide. *C: Look, you're a Buddhist, I'm a Catholic. If they committed suicide at that church and the priest holds mass tonight, that story won't hold water. Where are they? *M: Their bodies are behind General Staff Headquarters. Do you want to see them? *C: No. *M: Why not? *C: Well, if by chance one of a million of the people believe you that they committed suicide in church and I see that they have not committed suicide and I know differently, then if it ever leaks out, I am in trouble. Conein knew that if he saw the execution wounds, he would not be able to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington.Jones, p. 430. The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00 on 2 November and showed the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in Time read \\"'Suicide' with no hands.\\"Jones, pp. 430‚Äì31. Media reaction After the deaths, the military junta asserted that the Ng√¥ brothers had committed suicide. On 6 November, Information Minister Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Oai declared at a news conference that Di·ªám and Nhu had died through \\"accidental suicide\\" after a firearm discharged when Nhu had tried to seize it from the arresting officer. This drew immediate skepticism from David Halberstam of The New York Times, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam reporting. Halberstam wrote to the US Department of State that \\"extremely reliable private military sources\\" had confirmed that the brothers were ordered to be executed upon their return to military headquarters. Neil Sheehan of UPI reported a similar account based on what he described as \\"highly reliable sources\\". Father Leger of Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church asserted that the Ng√¥ brothers were kneeling inside the building when soldiers burst in, took them outside and into the APC. Lodge had been informed by \\"an unimpeachable source\\" that both brothers were shot in the nape of the neck and that Di·ªám's body bore the signs of a beating. Impact and aftermath Once the news of the cause of death of the Ngo brothers began to become public, the United States became concerned at their association with the new junta and their actions during the coup. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk directed Lodge to question Minh about the killings. Lodge cabled back, initially backing the false story disseminated by the generals, saying that their story was plausible because of the supposedly loaded pistol being left on the floor of the vehicle.Winters, p. 107. Rusk was worried about the public relations implications the bloody photographs of the brothers would generate. Lodge showed no alarm in public, congratulating ƒê√¥n on the \\"masterful performance\\" of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition. ƒê√¥n's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned proved sufficient for Lodge, who told the State Department that \\"I am sure assassination was not at their direction.\\" Minh and ƒê√¥n reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day. Several members of the Kennedy administration were appalled by the killings. The Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs W. Averell Harriman declared that \\"it was a great shock to everybody that they were killed.\\" He postulated that it was an accident and speculated that Nhu may have caused it by insulting the officers who were supervising him. Embassy official Rufus Phillips, who was the US adviser to Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, said that \\"I wanted to sit down and cry\\", citing the killings as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam.Jones, p. 436. According to historian Howard Jones, the fact \\"that the killings failed to make the brothers into martyrs constituted a vivid testimonial to the depth of popular hatred they had aroused.\\" The assassinations caused a split within the coup leadership, turning the initial harmony among the generals into discord, and further abroad repulsed American and world opinion, exploding the myth that this new regime would constitute a distinct improvement over their predecessors, and ultimately convinced Washington that even though the leaders' names had changed in Saigon, the situation remained the same. The criticism of the killings further caused the officers to distrust and battle one another for positions in the new government. ƒê√¥n expressed his abhorrence at the assassinations by caustically remarking that he had organised the armoured car in an effort to protect Di·ªám and Nhu. Khanh claimed that the only condition he had put on joining the conspiracy was that Diem would not be killed. According to Jones, \\"when decisions regarding postcoup affairs took priority, resentment over the killings meshed with the visceral competition over government posts to disassemble the new regime before it fully took form.\\" Culpability debate alt=Middle-aged black-haired man, stands side-on in a dark suit with a cigarette in right hand and left hand in pocket, looking at the large map of the Asia Pacific region on the wall. The responsibility for the assassinations was generally placed on Minh. Conein asserted that \\"I have it on very good authority of very many people, that Big Minh gave the order\\", as did William Colby, the director of the CIA's Far Eastern division. ƒê√¥n was equally emphatic, saying \\"I can state without equivocation that this was done by General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and by him alone.\\"Jones, p. 435. Lodge thought that Xu√¢n was also partly culpable asserting that \\"Di·ªám and Nhu had been assassinated, if not by Xu√¢n personally, at least at his direction.\\" Minh placed the blame on Thi·ªáu, after the latter became President, for the assassinations. In 1971, Minh claimed that Thi·ªáu was responsible for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by his Fifth Division on Gia Long Palace. ƒê√¥n was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night, asking him on the phone \\"Why are you so slow in doing it? Do you need more troops? If you do, ask ƒê√≠nh to send more troops ‚Äì and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general.\\"Hammer, p. 299. Thi·ªáu stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement which Minh did not publicly rebut: \\"D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám.\\" During the presidency of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost to him in the 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E. Howard Hunt into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.Hammer, p. 296. Motivation Conein asserted that Minh's humiliation by Di·ªám and Nhu was a major motivation for ordering their executions. Conein reasoned that Di·ªám and Nhu were doomed once they escaped from Gia Long Palace, instead of surrendering there and accepting the offer of safe exile. Having successfully stormed the palace, Minh had presumed that the brothers would be inside, and arrived at the presidential residence in full ceremonial military uniform \\"with a sedan and everything else.\\" Conein described Minh as a \\"very proud man\\" who had lost face at turning up at the palace for his moment of glory, only to find an empty building. More than a decade after the coup, Conein claimed Di·ªám and Nhu would not have been killed if they had been in the palace, because there were too many people present. One Vietnamese Di·ªám loyalist asked friends in the CIA why an assassination had taken place, reasoning that if Diem was deemed to be inefficient, his deposal would suffice. The CIA employees responded that \\"They had to kill him. Otherwise his supporters would gradually rally and organise and there would be civil war.\\" Some months after the event, Minh was reported to have privately told an American that \\"We had no alternative. They had to be killed. Di·ªám could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared ‚Äì and he had created organizations that were arms of his personal power.\\" Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng, a civilian opposition politician who was jailed in 1960 for signing the Caravelle Manifesto that criticised Di·ªám, and later briefly served as Prime Minister, gave a scathing analysis of the generals' action. He stated that \\"The top generals who decided to murder Di·ªám and his brother were scared to death. The generals knew very well that having no talent, no moral virtues, no political support whatsoever, they could not prevent a spectacular comeback of the president and Mr. Nhu if they were alive.\\"Jones, pp. 435‚Äì36. Burials of Di·ªám and Nhu At around 16:00 on 2 November, the bodies of Di·ªám and Nhu were identified by the wife of former Cabinet minister Tr·∫ßn Tr√πng Dung.Buttinger, p. 1008. The corpses were taken to St. Paul's Catholic Hospital, where a French doctor made a formal statement of death without conducting an autopsy. The original death certificate did not describe Di·ªám as Head of State but as \\"Chief of Province\\", a post he had held four decades earlier under the French colonial administration. Nhu was described as \\"Chief of Library Service\\", a post which he held in the 1940s. This was interpreted as a Vietnamese way of expressing contempt for the two despised leaders. Their place of burial was never disclosed by the junta and rumours regarding it persist to the current day. The speculated burial places include a military prison, a local cemetery, the grounds of the JGS headquarters and there are reports of cremation as well.Shaplen, p. 210.Jacobs, p. 189. Nobody was ever prosecuted for the killings.Jones, p. 180. Memorial services The government did not approve a public memorial service for the deaths of Di·ªám and Nhu until 1968. In 1971, several thousand mourners gathered at Di·ªám's purported gravesite. Catholic prayers were given in Latin. Banners proclaimed Di·ªám as a saviour of the south, with some mourners having walked into Saigon from villages outside the capital carrying portraits of Di·ªám. Madame Thi·ªáu, the First Lady, was seen weeping at a requiem mass at Saigon's basilica. Several cabinet members were also at the grave and a eulogy was given by a general of the ARVN. According to the eulogy, Di·ªám died because he had resisted the domination of foreigners and their plans to bring great numbers of troops to Vietnam and widen a war which would have destroyed the country.Hammer, p. 317. Thi·ªáu sponsored the services, and it was widely seen as a means of associating himself with Di·ªám's personal characteristics. Di·ªám frequently refused to follow American advice and was known for his personal integrity, in contrast to Thi·ªáu, who was infamous for corruption and regarded as being too close to the Americans. However, Thi·ªáu's attempts to associate himself with Di·ªám's relative independence from United States influence was not successful.Lipsman and Weiss, pp. 156‚Äì57. According to General Maxwell Taylor, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, \\"there was the memory of Di·ªám to haunt those of us who were aware of the circumstances of his downfall. By our complicity, we Americans were responsible for the plight in which the South Vietnamese found themselves\\".Hammer, p. 315.

It was published in 1992 and won the W.D. Weatherford Award that year. Plot summary The Unquiet Earth is a novel written from the perspective of multiple narrators. The three main narrators are Dillon, Rachel, and Jackie who are all family. Dillon is Rachel's younger cousin, and Jackie is most likely their child. The story begins prior to the birth of Jackie and is narrated by Dillon and Rachel, children living on their family land, the Homeplace. From the beginning, Dillon makes claims that he loves Rachel partially because she is the only one who has memories of his father. They both narrate parts of their childhood and the beginning of the novel mainly depicts how their relationship grows and how their love for one another begins. They are first cousins - therefore, their mothers are sisters. The first instance in which their love is really shown is when Rachel falls into a river and Dillon is forcibly restrained by his mother from diving in to save her because of her fear of losing him as well. He is forced to watch Rachel suffer and nearly be swept away by the current, but luckily she was dragged out by the mule she was riding. They rush her home, and Dillon watches through a window as his mother helps a cold and naked Rachel recover. The story continues as they grow older and continue to fight for love. Rachel ends up leaving the Homeplace to attend a nursing school, where she spends several subsequent years. Dillon then, in what everyone believes is out of anger of Rachel leaving him, enlists in the British army to fight against Hitler. Upon Rachel's graduation from nursing school, she and her friend Tommie Justice enlist as nurses in the war as well. Rachel returns to find out that the Homeplace is no longer their land as Dillon had forewarned her many times. They are reunited at the number thirteen mine in Justice County where the remainder of the story takes place. Rachel continues working there as a county nurse, and Dillon works for the mine while avidly fighting for the union against the American Coal Company and Arthur Lee, who owns it. Arthur Lee is already an acquaintance of Rachel's because he dated her friend Tommie previously and introduced her to his friend Tony. Rachel and Dillon continue to fight and disagree about their love for one another. Rachel is scared that they would be deemed illegitimate by society and tries to deny her love for her cousin. This offends and angers Dillon, who is against the social norms and wishes to love Rachel even if society believes it is the wrong thing to do. He wants to marry Rachel, but it is illegal to marry a first cousin. When the trouble with the coal company gets worse, Dillon asks that Rachel leave her job for the county, and help him in the fight against the coal companies as the other wives were doing. However, Dillon and Rachel were raised differently, and the words of her dying mother echoed in her head. She was raised by her mother to believe that men want a prim and proper lady, certainly not one who has sex before marriage. It would be wrong for kin to sleep with kin, and even more wrong for two first cousins to marry one another. Standing strong in these beliefs, Rachel ends up marrying Tony, an Italian man that Tommie and Arthur Lee set her up with. She has trouble having kids with Tony and continues to stay close to Dillon. Eventually, she gives into the fact that she loves Dillon and they make love in the secluded area of Trace Mountain where they conceive their daughter, Jackie. However, throughout the rest of the novel this escape to the mountain is kept quiet and Jackie believes until the very end that Tony is her father. After Rachel and Tony finally divorce due to an unhappy marriage and his escapes to the bar, Tony gets remarried and has trouble again having babies. Rachel fears that this will cause him suspicion of Jackie being his and that he will try to take her away. Dillon's prior paranoia is justified at the end of the novel. The book closes with the breaking of the dawn above the towns, and eventually shows once again that the mining company's guarantee of safety was untrue. Jackie is left alone after the deaths of Tom and Dillon in the flood and moves away. The story closes with Jackie wanting to forget the place she called home. The book does a good job of creating a scene of mountain utopia that was slowly eroded away by the mining to an area that was undesirable and almost uninhabitable. Historical fiction Geographic Setting The beginning of the story is set in the 1930s and continues through 1990 in coal mining country near the West Virginia and Kentucky border. The book contains a hand-drawn map that shows towns, rivers and creeks, mountains, and mining camps that are referenced in the story. Most of the map focuses on Justice County, West Virginia, and the adjacent West Virginia county of McDowell and Paine County, Kentucky. McDowell County is an actual county on West Virginia's southwest border, but both Justice County and Paine County are fictional. The fictional Justice County takes the place of Mingo County, the site of the Mingo County coal war and the Matewan Massacre. The Television People Jackie Honaker finds herself an innocent victim of American news media propaganda. There is a news group reporting on Christmas in Appalachia. Rachel Honaker brings them to Jackie's school to film part of their report. The news crew first asks to film in the cafeteria, then the library, only to discover the school has neither. Announcing that they need to have a location large enough to distribute shoes donated by a New Jersey shoe company, the news crew hints that the true purpose of their documentary is to portray the region as one of extreme poverty and disarray. Jackie's teacher, Miss Cox, tells the class the true reason behind the news crew's presence. Many of the students neither want nor need shoes and do not wish to participate, but the news group exploits the innocence of their youth, bribing them with the opportunity to be on television if they will line up to receive shoes. Afterward, some of the students throw away their shoes. Federal Assistance to Appalachia One of the secondary characters, Tom Kolwiecki, is from New Jersey. Tom is a volunteer and part of the VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) program, and his character is regularly referred to as ' the VISTA' by the inhabitants of the mining community. The VISTA program is a real program and part of the AmeriCorps organization that promotes community service. The VISTA program grew into prominence with the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 signed by President Lyndon Johnson. In the book, Kolwiecki first appears in 1965. The Red Scare When Tom Kolwiecki and the Concerned Citizens attempt to make the Co-op grocery to compete with the overpriced general store, the local newspaper deems them communists and claims that a Co-op is un-American. Arthur Lee also angrily claimed that VISTA, the government aid program that Tom was sent from, was a product of communism. Tom is not the only victim of the power of the Red Scare. During the mining strikes, orchestrated by Dillon Freeman, the impact is so great that there is federal involvement ( Agent Temple) in order to subdue the miners and force them back to work. Novel themes Peace and War A major theme of this book was peace and war. Although the book wasn‚Äôt about a direct war it was about a war that took place between coal miners and large coal companies that often took advantage of those miners. Specifically, after WWII, Dillon comes back to find a completely different world because of the demand that is placed on the coal miner and the little respect that they are granted. A large portion of the book depicts their fight to gain their peace: their rights, their pay and their jobs. Every character of the book is involved in the war for peace because they all live in the coal town and are being directly affected by the strikes, the random FBI interactions, and other members in their family being coal miners. Death Another theme in the book is death. A lot of characters meet their death throughout the book and there is even the segment of the book where it is said that ‚Äúnothing is permanent, not even death‚Äù because graves are being dug up in order to benefit coal companies. There is also the death resulting from Black Lung, mine roof collapse, Rachel‚Äôs heart problems, and many others. Different ways of dealing with death are found throughout the book as well as traditions and rituals. Dillon portrays the traditional approach to death by burying the trophy skull that Rachel brought back from the war. He believed that it should be respected, even if it was the enemy's. He also took great care of the family cemetery and wanted Rachel to be buried there in a simple and traditional way. Dillon also believed that death could tell a story. He goes to clean up the graves where a Polish coal miner had been buried in order to show it to Lech Walesa to get him to relate to the deaths in and of the coal mines. The death of coal mining towns was also included in the text. It shows the progress of the industry and how fewer people have the ability to stay in the area. As more of the jobs are mechanized, more people lose their jobs. The money stops following everywhere and the town starts to slowly die, one family and one business at a time. Race Race is evident in this novel from the struggles that the African American communities faced in the Appalachian towns to the ways they were segregated in the war. In the coal towns‚Äô blacks were segregated sometimes in the camps into negro and white towns while others were completely mixed. Over in the war there were ‚Äònegro troops‚Äô separated from white troops. Roots The underlying theme of the novel is about homeplace and having roots. Emphasis is put on Dillon being deeply tied to Trace Mountain and the Homeplace where he grew up. Also we can see as the story progresses that Jackie, as Dillon‚Äôs daughter, also has these ties to land in her blood. Towards the end of the novel it is evident that Jackie has deep ties to Number Thirteen. Both Jackie and Dillon follow the theme of roots when together they go to the family cemetery to witness the moving of their family‚Äôs bodies due to American Coal buying the land for mining. When Jackie and Dillon return to the truck Dillon realizes their bond to each other, the land, and their family is so strong that he tells her she is his daughter. This is a great example of how roots tie the entire story together, as Rachel returns home to the Kentucky mountains and Dillon makes them his final resting place. Forbidden Love Another main theme of this novel is the idea of forbidden love between main characters Dillon and Rachael. Although they are first cousins, the pair experiences undeniable sexual attraction throughout the novel. Their first encounter occurs around 1940 on the courthouse lawn. This is where Dillon makes his first move by kissing Rachel and unbuttoning part of her blouse. This encounter sets up their romance for the rest of the novel, because it shows the turmoil this connection brings to the main characters. During this encounter Rachel says, ‚ÄúDillon, we‚Äôre first cousins. We couldn‚Äôt have babies, there might be something wrong with them. And we can‚Äôt marry, it‚Äôs against the law.‚Äù This quote summarizes the theme of forbidden love throughout the novel by stating three main arguments against a potential relationship. However, Rachel and Dillon do eventually consummate their romance with a sexual encounter on Trace Mountain where they conceive a daughter, Jackie, who is attributed to her husband at the time, Tony. They continue their love affair through her marriage with Tony and once they are divorced Dillon, Rachel, and Jackie share a house together. Although, Dillon and Rachel do not share a bed in its most literal sense, however, Rachel continues to sleep with Dillon downstairs. Their relationship is a forbidden one but one they give into, even if only briefly, with little hesitation and the hesitation comes from Rachel alone. Along with the theme of forbidden love, another prominent matter throughout the novel is the idea of having a child with someone related to you (in Rachel and Dillon‚Äôs case, first cousins). From the first chapter of this book, this idea is discussed and highly retorted. The subject is initially brought up when Rachel and Dillon are small children ‚Äì ‚ÄúDillon is your first cousin. You want to have babies that aren‚Äôt right? ‚Ä¶ I mean simple in the head. Deformed,‚Äù Flora Honaker abruptly states. This is something brought up many times throughout the first book. Rachel often explains her dilemma to her nursing school roommate and friend, Tommie. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ I miss him so bad. But he‚Äôs my cousin, so we‚Äôve got no future,‚Äù Rachel explains, fighting back the urges of her forbidden love for Dillon. When Rachel and Dillon sleep together for the second time, Rachel immediately questions Dillon regarding their potential child together ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo you think it would be all right? It wouldn‚Äôt be deformed?‚Äù Shortly thereafter, Rachel found out she was pregnant and later gave birth to her daughter, Jackie. Even though the father of Jackie was always in question throughout the novel, the subject of whether or not Dillon was the father and the issues that would come along with this was often brought up. Power Another theme that is intertwined all throughout The Unquiet Earth is power. We see the power of the coal companies, as they own and operate the coal towns and control the lives of its citizens. Everyone who resides within the coal camp, whether they are a miner, related to a miner or have another occupation within the camp are affected by the power of the coal company. The coal company owns the houses and, in a sense, owns the miners as well, as the companies control the amount of money put into the operation of the coal towns. The miners are treated terribly by the company and told what to do, when to work, and where to work. They have little concern for the miner‚Äôs safety or well-being, since high production is their number one goal. They are so desperate for workers, in fact, that the miners in the novel are even held by gun point and led to the mines against their will and forced to work as a result of the coal company: when Rachel looks out the window and sees men with guns take her neighbors to the mines to work against their will. Also, the coal company is trying to overpower the citizens and miners to prevent them from striking. Strength Strength is another very important, yet easily overlooked theme in The Unquiet Earth. We see the strength of the Appalachian women through Carrie freeman as well as through Flora Honaker. In the beginning of the novel we get quite a few examples of how strong of people these two women are. Carrie became pregnant from a man who was not her husband and this was looked down on by many of people in this time period. Despite how people looked at her she continued to do her job and raise her family. The father of her child had also died when the child was young so she practically raised him by herself. Floras' situation is a little different. She has to be strong in the aspect that her daughter is leaving to attend a nursing program, but Flora does not want her to do nursing. So she respects her daughter's decision and stays strong as she leaves. The women of this time period had to stay strong through hard times and situations. Character list Dillon Freeman Dillon is one of three main characters in The Unquiet Earth. He is the main rebellious character of the novel running away from home, leading a strike, and blowing up a bridge to fight the coal companies. He is Rachel‚Äôs cousin and lover.

Ethel Ethel was a woman working in the coal mines. She had a daughter, Tiffany, with Sim Gore's son Leon. Buffalo Creek Flood Buffalo Creek, which spans 17 miles, is located in a hollow of southern West Virginia‚Äôs Logan County and consists of three branches. More than thirty years ago, it was the location of one of the deadliest floods in U.S. history, the Buffalo Creek flood. Due to neglectful and inattentive strip mining and heavy rain in the area, a powerful flood swept through the hollow, killing 125 men, women, and children, as well as injuring over 1,000 people. Prior to the flood on February 26, 1972, mining officials of the area, who were concerned about the condition of the highest dam, measured the water levels every two hours the night before due to the continuous onslaught of heavy rain. Although mining company officials were notified of the increasing danger, the residents of the hollow were not informed. At 8:05 a.m., the dam collapsed and about 132 million gallons of black waste water rushed through the narrow Buffalo Creek hollow. On top of the 125 deaths and thousands of injuries that resulted, over 4,000 people were left homeless. The flood destroyed 943 homes, resulting in overall property damage estimated at $50 million. On her website, Giardina says: ‚ÄúThe Buffalo Creek ‚Äòflood‚Äô was the heart of my young adulthood. It is the heart of The Unquiet Earth.‚ÄùThe Unquiet Earth, Denise Giardina's official website, accessed August 20, 2011 She states that an early draft of the novel placed the flood in 1972, when the real flood occurred. However, because Giardina believed that the event was \\"too dramatic and destructive\\" to be placed in the middle of the story, she placed the flood at the end in order to balance the novel.

Description This plant does not have the immediately recognizable sharply pointed leaflets on its fronds that many other ferns have. Its leaves bear rounded or oval-shaped segments widely spaced along the rachis. Each segment may curl under along its edges. The leaves are green when new, then turn red, purplish, or brown. Some individuals of this species are diploid and reproduce sexually, while some are triploid or tetraploid and reproduce by apogamy (growth of a plant from a gamete without fertilization). Habitat Pellaea andromedifolia is found on dry Western facing sunny banks, in coastal, Mojave Desert, and California chaparral and woodlands habitats. It is able to take long periods without water, when it will shrivel and appear dead. Then shortly after rainfall new growth appears quickly from the ground. It is not crown forming, but spreading slowly and forming clumps.

Biography Prows was born in the upper part of the Kanawha Valley, Virginia (now part of West Virginia). His father was Thomas Prows III, the son of an American Revolutionary War veteran. William Prows' mother was Eleanor Kountz, a descendant of an 18th-century Dutch immigrant to colonial America. William Prows had New England roots and was a descendant of Captain Thomas Pickering, an early leader of Portsmouth, New Hampshire and through his paternal grandmother, the Lowell family of Massachusetts. In 1829, Prows' parents moved the family to Fulton, Morrow County, Ohio (near present- day Cincinnati), and then in 1831, to Dearborn, Indiana. It was in Indiana that the Prows family became acquainted with Mormonism in the late 1830s. The Prows family desired to move to Nauvoo, Illinois, where Prows, along with his parents and some siblings, joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1841. A year later, his mother Eleanor died in 1842. Two months after her death, his grieving father Thomas married Charity Arms, a fellow Mormon, who provided a mother figure for William's younger siblings, the youngest of which was aged one when his mother died. William and his family experienced the troubles faced by the Mormons in Nauvoo from 1842 to 1846. William's father left Mormonism in 1846, but his stepmother Charity Arms decided to stay and move west with the rest of the Mormons. Nineteen-year-old William stayed too and promised to support his stepmother for the trek across the Great Plains to Utah. National events, though, intervened and prevented Prows from keeping part of this promise. The United States was at war with Mexico and in need of men. In July 1846, military leaders in Washington, D.C. asked the Mormons who had just fled Nauvoo‚Äîand had been rebuffed by the federal government when they sought protection and redress for persecution against them‚Äîto provide a volunteer battalion to assist with the war efforts for the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Brigham Young, who was the de facto Mormon leader, agreed to provide a battalion. The enlistees were paid $42 for a uniform allowance. William saw this as an opportunity to earn money to provide for his stepmother for her trek to Utah. He wouldn't accompany her to Utah but she would have money to help prepare for the trek. Prows enlisted in the battalion that became known as the Mormon Battalion. The Mormon Battalion holds two distinctions in U.S. military history‚Äî(1) it is the only religiously-based unit in U.S. military history; and (2) it holds the record for the longest march in U.S. military history. Prows served in Company B. The Battalion marched from the banks of the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska to San Diego, California, and on to Los Angeles, California. After one year of service, Prows was discharged in Los Angeles, California, in July 1847. The Mormon Battalion never faced a battle during its service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After being discharged, Prows, along with other Mormon Battalion veterans, traveled up to present-day Sacramento, California. In 1848, while working at Sutter's Mill on the American River, Prows was among the group of Mormon Battalion veterans that discovered the gold that sparked the California Gold Rush. Shortly thereafter, Prows left California for Utah.Zanjani, Sally Springmeyer. Devils Will Reign: How Nevada Began. University of Nevada Press, 2006, p. 175. During his trek to Utah, Prows reportedly was the first man to wash gold on the Comstock Lode.Southern California Quarterly. Los Angeles County Pioneers of Southern California, Historical Society of Southern California, p. 297. The other principal candidate for discovering the Comstock Lode is Abner Blackburn.Bagley, Will, ed. Frontiersman: Abner Blackburn's Narrative, ix, 133‚Äì36. Prows married Lodesky Roberds in 1851 and returned to California to take part in the Gold Rush. He and three of his brothers accumulated $15,000 each from gold mining by 1857. They decided to move to Sonoma County, California, and set up a brood sow business. The business failed and they lost their wealth. Prows decided to return to Utah to be around other Mormons and live his religion. Back in Utah, Prows become an early Utah Mormon leader and was among the founders of Fillmore, Utah. In 1868, Prows became a polygamist and married his second wife, Louisa Rowena James, a part-Cherokee woman who had joined the church with her parents years earlier. Prows, a cooper by trade like his father and grandfather, made his living primarily through farming and livestock. He lived in Kanosh, Utah during the latter part of his life. In 1889, he was jailed for 65 days for unlawful cohabitation for practicing polygamy. After his release, he decided to move his family to Colonia Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, Mexico, a colony founded by Mormons seeking to avoid prosecution for practicing polygamy. Prows arrived in Mexico with his families in 1894. Shortly after his arrival, he became ill and died in Colonia Ju√°rez on May 24, 1894.

The study is also funded, with great appreciation, by the William M. Wood Foundation and the Paulette and Marty Samowitz Foundation. Born in Palo Alto, California, Perls later moved to Colorado and now lives in Boston.

Perls is Professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and attending physician in geriatrics at Boston Medical Center. He is author of over 160 peer reviewed articles primarily in the areas of biodemography and genetics of human exceptional longevity and anti-aging quackery. Generally, the study has found that centenarians and their children (in their 70s thru 90s) age relatively slowly and have decreased risk for aging-related diseases including Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and restrictive lung disease. Our studies are using different but synergistic approaches to discover the biological and environmental exposure and behavioral mechanisms by which these individuals age so well and live so long.

It stars Alan Ladd, Brian Donlevy, William Bendix, and Barry Fitzgerald. Plot summary Brian Donlevy, Esther Fern√°ndez and Alan Ladd in a promotional picture of the film. In 1834, Charles Stewart (Alan Ladd), the spoiled, dissolute son of a shipping magnate, is shanghaied aboard the Pilgrim, one of his father's own ships. He embarks upon a long, hellish sea voyage under the tyrannical rule of Captain Francis Thompson (Howard Da Silva), assisted by his first mate, Amazeen (William Bendix). One of his crewmates is Richard Henry Dana Jr. (Brian Donlevy), who will ultimately recount the entire voyage on paper as a book.

Actor Lew Ayres was mentioned as a possible director and Lionel Barrymore, or, if he refused, Walter Connolly was going to star. The movie was meant to be an attempt by Republic to move into bigger budgeted productions. Negotiations with Barrymore, Connolly and Fredric March fell through and the studio tried to sign Herbert Wilcoxon. Republic never made the movie. Edward Small announced plans to film the book in 1939 under his deal with United Artists. However this was postponed when World War II was declared, as Small was reluctant to make such an expensive film in an uncertain marketplace. Plans to film the book were again announced in 1940 and 1941 but no movie resulted.author=Paramount eventually bought the rights off Small in 1943, including a script Seton I Miller had written for the producer in 1939; Miller had since become a writer and producer at Paramount. Alan Ladd was announced as star. Pre- Production In March 1944 it was announced Ladd would be re-inducted into the army but that this would be delayed so he could make Mast. Brian Donlevy was originally going to play the sadistic captain but was given the role of Dana instead. Howard da Silva, who had just achieved fame playing Judd in Oklahoma! on Broadway, played the captain. Mexican film star Esther Fern√°ndez had been signed to Paramount for two years without making a film. John Farrow watched some test footage she made and was impressed; she was brought back to play the female lead. Due to war time restrictions ‚Äì notably lack of transport ‚Äì Paramount had endured many logistical difficulties filming the pirate movie Frenchman's Creek on location. This prompted them to decide to shoot Two Years Before the Mast entirely within the confines of the studio. Seascapes and soundscapes from Paramount's Souls at Sea (1937) were re-used. The film heavily dramatised the novel but attempted to be faithful. \\"Dana's tale is so well known that we shall have to stay close to the line of his yarn\\", said John Farrow, \\"Especially in the characters.\\" Extensive research was done on the project for six months prior to shooting. Shooting Filming began in May 1944 and took 69 days. \\"We could do it in less but we've got to allow stubble to grow\\", said Farrow. \\"Chins have got to grow over with gray plush. May cost a hundred thousand. Depends on how long it takes those chins to sprout. But meantime, we can be shooting storms and Miss Fernandez.\\" Alan Ladd injured his back during filming and had to miss a week of shooting. The movie was shot on three studio sound stages. Four stage were combined into one, for the interiors. There was another stage holding the water tank. Two models of the ship were built at a total cost of $150,000.author=Paramount were so pleased with Da Silva's performance they signed him to a seven-year contract. Darryl Hickman, who played the cabin boy, also impressed and was signed to a long-term contract. Release The film was not released until late 1946, after the release of several films Ladd made subsequent to Mast: Salty O'Rourke, The Blue Dahlia and O.S.S.. This also meant that Barry Fitzgerald, who became a star in Going My Way (1944) while the film was waiting for release, was upped to above the title billing. Box office Two Years Before the Mast was one of the most popular films released in the US that year, Los Angeles Times describing it as \\"a phenomenal hit\\". Variety listed it as the tenth most popular movie of 1946.

It was bought by Fidelity Investments in 1993 and incorporated into Community Newspaper Company, Massachusetts' largest weekly newspaper publisher, now owned by GateHouse Media.  History  Beacon's history begins in the 1940s with the first issues of The Beacon newspaper, later for a time called the Assabet Valley Beacon. The newspaper eventually grew to cover the towns of Acton, Boxborough, Maynard and Stow, just west of Concord, Massachusetts. Over time, The Beacon's publishers acquired other weeklies in neighboring towns, including titles as far east as Lexington and Burlington. The company's last independent owners were Joseph V. Stuart and Robert E. Anderson, who sold the papers in 1984 to the owners of the Worcester Telegram daily newspaper in Worcester.Tolman, Lynne. \\"Beacon Under Owner's Review; 12 Are 'Relieved of Responsibilities'\\".

The dailies had been sold to the Telegram in 1969.Frain, Mary. \\"Marlboro Enterprise is 100\\". Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), page B1, September 3, 1989. The sale also tied Beacon to independent mid-sized dailies, the Telegram and Evening Gazette, in an industry rapidly consolidating. With the death of Telegram owner Robert W. Stoddard in December 1984, the company was sold 21 months later to Chronicle Publishing Company of San Francisco, California.Kranish, Michael. \\"Firm Agrees to Buy Worcester Papers\\". The Boston Globe, October 8, 1986. Chronicle's investment in Massachusetts continued in 1989 with the purchase of the Southborough Villager, a 1,500-circulation weekly that was added to Beacon's roster. Peter E. Thieriot, Chronicle's local publisher, said \\"I have expressed my hope and desire that Beacon grow both internally and through acquisition. This is the acquisition.\\"\\"Chronicle Publishing to Buy Southboro Villager\\". Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), page 15, June 24, 1989. In the Chronicle years, however, Beacon's corporate ownership usually had its hands full with its Worcester property‚Äîturning two commonly owned but competing newsrooms into one staff, and finally shuttering an evening newspaper to concentrate on a combined morning edition. With its focus solely on Worcester County, said a Chronicle executive, it \\"was logical\\" to sell Beacon.Donker, Peter P. \\"T&G; Parent Sells Beacon Newspapers\\". Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), May 28, 1993.  Fidelity  The buyer was Fidelity Investments' Community Newspaper Company, which in 1993 was already the dominant weekly newspaper publisher in north and west suburban Boston. Beacon Communications filled a hole in CNC's coverage arc from MetroWest (Tab Communications) to Essex County (Bay State Newspaper Company and North Shore Weeklies). With the purchase, CNC's weekly circulation rose to 630,000, a number higher than the daily circulation of The Boston Globe, and CNC passed another milestone: the Sun and Enterprise, which CNC combined into one Enterprise-Sun, became the company's first daily newspaper. Beacon Communications, like most CNC acquisitions, was initially run as a semi-autonomous subsidiary. When News- Transcript Group was bought in 1995, Beacon's Enterprise-Sun initially seemed set to continue competing‚Äînot very successfully‚Äîwith the Middlesex News, which had a bureau in Marlborough. Instead, CNC folded its first daily, converting it into two weeklies and a West Edition for the News.Nutile, Tom, and Steven Syre. \\"On State Street: Newspaper Changes\\".

The Boston Globe, January 12, 1996.

Along with three other men, Gates, Parker and Bernay, and one woman, Elaine Dupree (Fitzgerald), Martin (an assumed name like the others) is sent to France to blow up a railroad tunnel in order to paralyze Axis troops during the Allied invasion. Martin doubts Elaine can work under pressure because she is a woman, but she insists he treat her as any male agent. During the group's first assignment, at a rural French inn, German agents kill Gates. A meeting of the French maquis is interrupted by German Colonel Paul Meister, who becomes immediately infatuated with Elaine. Elaine sculpts a bust of Meister's head, and when he announces his departure for Normandy on a troop train, she begs him to take her with him. With Martin's help, Elaine makes a duplicate bust and fills it with plastic explosives. She and Martin then blow up the tunnel. After Martin comes back for her under fire, Elaine makes him promise never to jeopardize a mission in order to rescue her. On foot, they meet Bernay, who is their radio contact with the O.S.S. As the Allies break through at Normandy, Elaine and Martin make a deal with Amadeus Brink, an officer of the Gestapo, who hopes to secure his safety and a small fortune. Brink removes Martin and Elaine's \\"wanted\\" file from the Gestapo sector headquarters and arranges for his cousin, a courier, to hand over a diplomatic pouch to Bernay for photocopying. Bernay places the negative in the lining of Martin's hat. Against Brink's advice, Bernay radios a final message that the Nazis have broken one of the O.S.S. secret codes. Bernay is gunned down, and Martin and Elaine are questioned by the Gestapo, but are released before Meister catches Brink with their file papers. Martin and Elaine are about to board a plane to safety when they are asked to complete one last mission. They must contact Parker, who is on assignment near the Rhine. At a farmhouse, Elaine is accosted by a group of drunken German soldiers. Parker, hiding among them, gives Elaine the Germans' troop dispositions. Martin leaves the farmhouse to radio in the positions. While he is gone, Meister arrests Elaine. As the American troops advance through France, Parker tells Martin that Elaine's real name was Ellen Rogers, and he imagines that she might have been the girl next door in his hometown.

He returned to Paramount, where he had been a screenwriter, and became a producer. He was assigned the job of writing and producing O.S.S. \\"Every studio in Hollywood was racing to come out with the first OSS film,\\" says Maibaum. \\"When I was in Washington I knew some of the OSS people so I had a head start on the subject.\\"Maibaum p.280 The studio had hoped to cast Sterling Hayden who had served in the OSS in real life. However he was still in uniform in early 1946 so the film was assigned to Alan Ladd, whose casting was announced in January 1946.

He published a number of influential studies on West African history including Introduction to the History of West Africa (1955). He subsequently co-founded the Journal of African History, the first specialist academic journal in the field, with Roland Oliver in 1960. Career=Early life John Fage was born in Teddington in Middlesex, England on 3 June 1921. He was educated at Tonbridge School and Magdalene College, Cambridge from 1939 where he studied history but his studies were interrupted by World War II. Fage was conscripted into the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1942 and was posted to Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) as part of the Commonwealth Air Training Plan and was subsequently given several postings in Africa, including in Madagascar. The experience sparked an interest in African history and he began research in the field on his return to Cambridge in 1945 where he lectured on European colonial expansion on the continent. He gained a doctorate at Cambridge in 1949 entitled \\"The achievement of self-government in Southern Rhodesia, 1898‚Äì1923\\". Ghana and SOAS Among other influential series, Fage co-edited the General History of Africa (1981-93) published by UNESCO In 1949, Fage took a post at the new University College of the Gold Coast in Accra, Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana) in West Africa which was affiliated to the University of London. Rising through the academic hierarchy, he published Introduction to the History of West Africa (1955, later re-published as A History of West Africa) and Atlas of African History (1958) and A Short History of Africa (1962). After Ghana's independence, Fage became Deputy Principal of the then- University College of Ghana and helped to establish the Institute of African Studies at Legon. It was said: In 1959, Fage returned to the United Kingdom to take a post at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London alongside Roland Oliver with whom he collaborated on several publications. With Oliver, Fage founded the Journal of African History (JAH) in 1960 which he co-edited until 1973. The JAH was the first academic journal devoted to African studies in the United Kingdom and one of the first such specialist journals globally. Birmingham and CWAS Fage moved to the University of Birmingham in 1963 to establish the Centre of West African Studies (CWAS) which he directed for over twenty years. African studies expanded rapidly in the United Kingdom at the same time, and Fage became one of the founding members of the African Studies Association of the United Kingdom (ASAUK) in which he served as president (1968‚Äì69) before being elected an honorary member. Fage and Oliver were also general editors of The Cambridge History of Africa (1975‚Äì86) and Fage also co-edited the General History of Africa (1981‚Äì93) published by UNESCO. Fage also published A History of Africa (1978). Fage chaired the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO (1966‚Äì83) and was a committee member of the International African Institute and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. His academic career culminated in his appointment as Vice-Principal of the University of Birmingham. Fage retired in 1984 and moved to Wales. He was a joint recipient of ASAUK's \\"Distinguished Africanist Award\\" in 2001. He died, aged 81, at Machynlleth on 6 August 2002.

The supporting cast includes Robert Preston and Brenda Marshall. The picture is based on a novel by Frank H. Spearman and a previous 1926 film adaptation starring H. B. Warner. Plot The bad Barton boys‚ÄîBlake, Leroy, and Gabby‚Äîrob a train and shoot a guard. Luke Smith, known as \\"Whispering\\" to some for his quiet ways, is a detective for the railroad sent to investigate. Murray Sinclair, an old friend of Smith's, is in charge of the railroad's wrecking crew. He's glad to see Smith, who shoots Leroy and Gabby and is saved when a bullet is deflected by a harmonica in his pocket, given him long ago by his sweetheart Marian, who is now Sinclair's wife. It saddens Smith to find out that Sinclair might be in cahoots with Barney Rebstock, a rancher with a bad reputation. Rebstock has been hiding the remaining Barton brother, Blake, who is tracked down by Smith. Whitey DuSang is a hired gun for Rebstock, who wants to see Smith dead. When the railroad's boss gives Sinclair an order, Sinclair rebels and is fired. Rebstock hires him to pull off a string of daring train holdups. Smith forms a posse. Whitey kills a guard and betrays Rebstock, shooting him. Sinclair is wounded. Smith does away with Whitey but gives his old friend Sinclair a last chance. When Sinclair rides home, he finds Marian packing and strikes her, accusing her of leaving him for Smith. Smith shows up and Sinclair apologises for his actions. He seems sincere, but when Smith's back is turned, Sinclair pulls a hidden gun. Before he can fire, Sinclair falls over and dies. Smith leaves town, his work there done.

It was Ladd's first Western and his first movie in colour. The script made a number of changes to the original novel including changing the double love story to one. Brenda Marshall was given her first screen role in four years. Filming began on 14 April 1947. The role of Whispering Smith was partly based on Jake Lefors. The part of Murray Sinclair, Smith's friend who turns to crime, was supposedly inspired by Butch Cassidy. The filmmakers built a Western town on five acres of the backlot at a cost of $70,000. It included 2000 feet of railroad track on which authentic 1870 locomotives owned by Paramount were operated. The trains were converted from their original wood-burning fuel system to oil. The set was later re-used in many later TV shows and films, including Bonanza. Reception The film was not released until 1949, by which time Paramount had made and released another Ladd film, Beyond Glory. The film was popular with audiences. According to Variety it was the 20th-most popular film in the US and Canada in 1949.Variety 4 January 1950 p 59 It was also one of the most watched films of the year in Britain. Possible follow up Sol Lesser, who had rights to ten Whispering Smith stories, wanted to film some of them with Robert Mitchum. These films were not made.

The Down Under rat (Downunder or DU) is a fancy rat variety noted for the markings on its stomach. The \\"downunder\\" marking refers to both a patch of colour on the underside of the rat which matches the coat colouring on the top, and to the variety's Australian origins. While most varieties either have a white pattern on their undersides, or they are completely one colour, the Down Under stands out for its coloured ventral markings against a white background. These markings may be symmetrical or asymmetrical shapes, stripes, or spots. Additionally, because other markings are traditionally found on other parts of the body, Downunders are able to be crossed with those markings to produce varieties like a DU blaze‚Äîa rat with a white stripe on its nose. The genes for creating a Downunder rat are dominant, needing only one parent to produce the marking. Due to Australia's strict importation laws, rats are prohibited from being intentionally brought into the country. This has forced the rat fancy hobby to develop varieties in parallel to those found abroad. The Down Under is the first variety to originate in Australia. It was first noted in a litter of hairless rats in New South Wales. The first breeding Down Under was a furred male named Enigma. It is sometimes thought that the Down Under variety came from breeders in Brisbane, the bRatpack and RatmanDU ratteries.

An earlier film version had been released in 1935. Plot Brian Donlevy, Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake in The Glass Key After falling for Janet Henry, the daughter of reform candidate for governor Ralph Henry, shady political boss Paul Madvig is determined to help Henry achieve his goal. Paul's right-hand man, Ed Beaumont, believes the move is a big mistake and correctly distrusts both Janet's and her father's motives; he feels they are stringing Paul along and will dump him after the election. Janet becomes engaged to Paul, but is put off by his crudity and becomes very attracted to the more eclectic Ed. He fends off her advances out of strong loyalty to Paul. The deluded Paul boasts that Henry has practically given him the key to his house; Ed warns him that it is liable to be a glass key, one that can break at any moment. When Paul tells one of his supporters, the gangster Nick Varna, that he is cleaning up the city and that Varna will no longer receive protection from the police, Ed grows even more concerned. Complicating matters further, Ralph's ne'er-do-well son, Taylor, owes Varna for gambling debts, while Paul's young sister, Opal, is in love with Taylor. Paul has told her to stay away from the young man, but she defies him; when he discovers this, Opal becomes fearful about what he might do to Taylor. Ed later finds Taylor's lifeless body in the street. Paul is the prime suspect, much to Nick's delight. When Nick hears that Ed and Paul have split due to Taylor's death, he tries to recruit Ed. Ed turns him down, so Nick has him brutally beaten repeatedly by his sadistic henchman Jeff, to force him into revealing details of corruption to the editor of the newspaper Nick controls. Ed contrives an escape and is hospitalized. When he recovers, he learns that Nick has found a \\"witness\\" to Taylor Henry's killing, Henry Sloss. Paul has Sloss brought to his office, but he is gunned down before he can talk. As a result, Paul is indicted for the murder and held in jail. Ed finds a somewhat drunk Jeff in a bar and, in a back room, tries to pump the thug for information. As they drink, Ed toasts, \\"Here's looking at you.\\" Just as Jeff starts to talk, Nick shows up and brusquely orders him to shut up. When Ed disarms Nick, a fed-up Jeff strangles his boss. Afterwards, Ed has the waiter call the police to arrest Jeff. Having finally guessed who killed Taylor, Ed persuades District Attorney Farr to arrest Janet. As Ed had hoped, Ralph confesses he struggled with Taylor, causing him to fall and strike his head. After everything is cleared up, Paul overhears Janet tell Ed that she loves him and that she knows he loves her.

They still retained the film rights in 1941, when Alan Ladd impressed Paramount executives while shooting This Gun for Hire. Even before the film was released, head of production Buddy de Sylva announced the studio would star Ladd in his own film as a follow up. Hammett's reputation was strong in Hollywood following the success of The Maltese Falcon and Paramount decided on a new version of The Glass Key; De Sylva said the studio wanted a \\"sure-fire narrative to help him [Ladd] on his way\\". Production was announced in October 1941. Two months later Paramount said that Ladd would make Red Harvest, from another Hammett novel, instead of The Glass Key, with Jonathan Latimer to write the script and Fred Kohlmar to produce. Brian Donlevy was assigned to co-star. However, these plans changed again‚ÄîRed Harvest was postponed (it was never made) and The Glass Key was re-activated, with Donlevy and Ladd to star. Stuart Heisler was assigned to direct. Paulette Goddard was originally cast as the female lead but had to drop out due to other commitment. She was replaced at first with Patricia Morison, but after seeing Lake and Ladd together in This Gun for Hire it was decided to replace Morison with Veronica Lake. Lake was going to be making I Married a Witch but that project was postponed when Joel McCrea turned down the lead role. Bonita Granville, Richard Denning and Joseph Calleia were assigned supporting roles. Old time movie stars Maurice Costello, Jack Mulhall and Pat O'Malley played minor roles. Reception=Critical response Variety magazine gave the film a favorable review: \\"Parading a murder mystery amidst background of politics, gambling czars, romance and lusty action, this revised version of Dashiell Hammett's novel--originally made in 1935--is a good picture of its type...Mixed well, the result is an entertaining whodunit with sufficient political and racketeer angles to make it good entertainment for general audiences. Donlevy makes the most of his role of the political leader who fought his way up from the other side of the tracks.\\"Variety. Film review, 1942. Accessed: April 28, 2008. Critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"The film is mostly done for entertainment purposes, as it lightly skips over the corrupt political process as merely background for the unlikely love story developing between the engaging Lake and the deadpan Ladd. The film had many undeveloped film noir themes used by other films. Howard Hawks's The Big Sleep borrowed freely from The Glass Key.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, December 4, 2004. Accessed: April 28, 2008. Critic Hal Erickson wrote: \\"Dashiel Hammett's The Glass Key, a tale of big-city political corruption, was first filmed in 1935, with Edward Arnold as a duplicitous political boss and George Raft as his loyal lieutenant. This 1942 remake improves on the original, especially in replacing the stolid Raft with the charismatic Alan Ladd...Far less complex than the Dashiel Hammett original (and far less damning of the American political system), The Glass Key further increased the box-office pull of Paramount's new team of Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake.\\"Erikson, Hal.

Located south of Vangunu Island in the Solomon Islands, it is named after a sea god of the New Georgia Group islanders, and is also referred to locally as Rejo te Kavachi (\\"Kavachi's oven‚Äô). The volcano has become emergent and then been eroded back into the sea at least eight times since its first recorded eruption in 1939.  Geography  In May 2000, an international research team aboard the CSIRO research vessel FRANKLIN fixed the position of the volcano at 8¬∞ 59.65'S, 157¬∞ 58.23'E. At that time the vent of the volcano was below sea level, but frequent eruptions ejected molten lava up to above sea level, and sulfurous steam plumes up to . The team mapped a roughly conical feature rising from water depth, with the volcano having a basal diameter of about .  Eruption  When the volcano erupted in 2003, a island formed above the surface, but it disappeared soon after. Additional eruptive activity was observed and reported in March 2004 and April 2007. In 2015, marine wildlife has been found living inside the Kavachi crater, including two species of sharks and a sixgill stingray.See also * List of recently born islands * List of volcanoes in the Solomon Islands * Woodlark Basin ReferencesFurther reading * Baker, E.T., Massoth, G.J., de Ronde, C.E.J., Lupton, J.E., Lebon, G., and McInnes, B.I.A. 2002.

The theater's Baroque spire is a replica of the Royal Castle in Warsaw Poles in Chicago are made up of both immigrant Poles and Americans of Polish heritage living in Chicago, Illinois. They are a part of worldwide Polonia, the Polish term for the Polish Diaspora outside of Poland. Poles in Chicago have contributed to the economic, social and cultural well-being of Chicago from its very beginning. Poles have been a part of the history of Chicago since 1837, when Captain Joseph Napieralski, along with other veterans of the November Uprising first set foot there.Lodesky, James D. Polish Pioneers in Illinois 1818-1850, XLibris (2010), p. 79Parot, Joseph J. Polish Catholics in Chicago, 1850‚Äì1920, Northwestern University Press (1981), p. 19 As of the 2000 U.S. census, Poles in Chicago were the largest European American ethnic group in the city, making up 7.3% of the total population.Parot, Joseph, J. \\"Polish Catholics in Chicago, 1850-1920, Northwestern University Press (1981), p. 18 However, according to the 2006‚Äì2008 American Community Survey, German Americans and Irish Americans each had slightly surpassed Polish Americans as the largest European American ethnic groups in Chicago. German Americans made up 7.3% of the population, and numbered at 199,789; Irish Americans also made up 7.3% of the population, and numbered at 199,294. Polish Americans now made up 6.7% of Chicago's population, and numbered at 182,064. Polish is the third most widely spoken language in Chicago behind English and Spanish. History A number of Poles contributed to the history of the city together with Captain Napieralski, a veteran of Cross Mountain during the November Uprising. Along with him came other early Polish settlers such as Major Louis Chlopicki, the nephew of General J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki who had been the leader of the same insurrection. Not to mention certain A. Panakaske (Panakaski) who resided in the second ward in the 1830s as well as J. Zoliski who lived in the sixth ward with records of both men having cast their ballots for William B. Ogden in the 1837 mayoral race in Chicago. Distribution According to Dominic Pacyga, most of the Poles who first came to Chicago settled in five distinct parts of the city.Pacyga, Dominic \\"Polish Immigrants and Industrial Chicago: Workers on the South Side, 1880‚Äì1922\\" University of Chicago Press, 1991, pp. 41‚Äì42 The first of those Polish Patches, as they were colloquially referred to, was located on the Near Northwest Side. Centering on the Polish Triangle at the intersection of Milwaukee and Ashland avenues with Division street it later became known as Polish Downtown. The second large settlement, developed in Pilsen on the west side near 18th street and Ashland avenue. Poles established two separate enclaves in the Stock Yard district, one in Bridgeport, the other in the Back of the Yards near 47th street and Ashland avenue. Another Polish neighborhood developed in the area around the massive Illinois Steel works in South Chicago in the area colloquially referred to as \\"the Bush\\". Polish communities in Chicago were often founded and organized around parishes mostly by peasant immigrants who named their neighbourhoods after them, like Bronislawowo, named after St. Bronislava.* Sometimes the neighbourhoods are contiguous so its difficult to say precisely where one ends and one begins, as in the case of 'Stanislawowo' by the church of St. Stanislaus Kostka and 'Trojcowo' by Holy Trinity Polish Mission in the former area of Polish Downtown. Initial historical Polish patches St. John Cantius Roman Catholic Church, one of Chicago's 'Polish Cathedrals'. In Polish the ending 'owo' in e.g., Bronislawowo functions similar to English 'ville' in Johnsville or 'ton' in Charleston. When added to a name of a saint, it indicates a Polish sounding town or a village. This is a colloquial phenomenon, not present in educated Polish; however, it persists in the names of different Polish areas of Chicago.

The same kind of advance occurred in the other original areas of Polish settlements so that Poles from both the Lower West Side and the Back of the Yards moved into both sides of Archer Avenue, giving rise to sizable Polish settlements on the Southwest Side of the city such as McKinley Park, Garfield Ridge, Brighton Park and Archer Heights. On the far Southeast Side, the South Chicago \\"steel mill settlements\\" spilled over into Pullman, Roseland, East Side, Hegewisch and Calumet City as well as into Lake County in Northwest Indiana, where thriving Polish communities were found in North Hammond, Whiting, the Indian Harbor section of East Chicago and several neighborhoods in the newly built industrial city of Gary. =North Side of Chicago= Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago's Polish Village.

Religion Holy Trinity Polish Mission. As in Poland, the overwhelming majority of Polish immigrants who settled in Chicago were culturally very devout Roman Catholics. Though almost all of the Polish Americans remained loyal to the Catholic Church after immigrating, a breakaway Catholic church was founded in 1897 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Polish parishioners founded the church to assert independence from the Catholic Church in America. The split was in rebellion from the church leadership, then dominated by Irish and German clergy, and lacking in Polish language speakers and Polish church leaders. The Bucktown campus of the former Cathedral of All Saints still stands as a testament to this community of faith. The current Cathedral and Cemetery complex on the city's periphery by Rosemont remains active and is still independent from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Poland is also home to followers of Protestantism and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Small groups of both of these groups are present Chicago. One of the most celebrated painters of religious icons in North America today is a Polish American Eastern Orthodox priest, Fr. Theodore Jurewicz, who singlehandedly painted New Graƒçanica Monastery in Third Lake, Illinois, over the span of three years.Serbian Monastery of New Gracanica ‚Äì History While large numbers of Jews from the former lands of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth immigrated to the Chicago area, they faced a historical trajectory far different from that of their Christian counterparts. In the process of Americanization, many Polish Jews in Chicago would lose their identification with Poland, with notable exceptions. There have also been small numbers of Muslims, mostly Lipka Tatars originating from the Bia≈Çystok region. The Polish presence in Chicago today The Polish Museum of America. Institutions Chicago bills itself as the largest Polish city outside of Poland with approximately 1,900,000 people of Polish ethnicity in the Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago's Polish presence is felt in the large number of Polish American organizations located there, including the Polish Museum of America, the Polish American Association, the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America. A column fragment of Wawel Castle, the onetime seat of Poland's Royalty has been incorporated into Chicago's landmark Tribune Tower as a visual tribute to Chicago's large Polish populace. Culture 'Polish singing bar' on Milwaukee Avenue. Circa 1999 Chicago also has a thriving Polish cultural scene. The Polish Arts Club of Chicago was founded in 1926. The city hosts the Polish Film Festival of America where various Polish films are screened during the weeklong festival every October. Polish stage productions in both Polish and English are regularly staged at numerous venues throughout the Chicago Metropolitan Area. The most prominent venues among these are the Chopin and Gateway Theatres. The Gateway, which is also the seat of the Polish Cultural Center in Chicago is the home of the Paderewski Symphony Orchestra. The Lira Ensemble, the only professional performing arts company outside of Poland that specializes in Polish music, song, and dance is Artist-in-Residence at Loyola University Chicago. Chicago celebrates its Polish Heritage every Labor Day weekend at the Taste of Polonia Festival in Jefferson Park, attended by such political notables as President George H. W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich, Hadassah Lieberman, Congresswoman Melissa Bean, and Tipper Gore.America the diverse - Chicago‚Äôs Polish neighborhoods (5/15/2005)USA Weekend Magazine. Illinois, due to the influence of this large population, is also one of the few states that celebrates Casimir Pulaski Day. Some schools and government services in the metro area are closed for the holiday. The Almanac of American Politics 2004 states that \\"Even today, in Archer Heights [a neighborhood of Chicago], you can scarcely go a block without hearing someone speaking Polish\\". This may be anachronistic because, although once true, today the Archer Heights neighborhood is predominately Mexican-American and Mexican, with many of the Polish former residents having died or moved to the suburbs. This is reflected in many of the businesses which served the Polish community having been replaced with businesses which serve the Mexican community. Polish-language business signs, once ubiquitous in Archer Heights, are now quite rare, while Spanish-language signs are seen on many businesses in the area. Much of 1950s Chicago Polish youth culture was captured in the 1972 musical Grease, in which the majority of characters had Polish surnames (Zuko, Dumbrowski, Kenickie); Jim Jacobs, who conceived Grease, based the musical on his real-life experiences in a Chicago high school. Much of the Polish- American nature of the musical was discarded when Grease was made into a feature film in 1978, casting non-Polish actors in the lead roles, and subsequent productions have also followed the film's lead in toning down the Chicago Polish influences. Poglish Some of Chicago Polonia (the Polish term for members of the expatriate Polish community) speak Poglish (usually referred to as Chicagowski by local Poles) a fusion of the Polish and English languages. Poglish is a common (to greater or lesser degree, almost unavoidable) phenomenon among persons bilingual in Polish and English, and its avoidance requires considerable effort and attention. Poglish is a manifestation of a broader phenomenon, that of language interference.

It starts at Whitney Portal, west of the town of Lone Pine, California. The hike is about round trip, with an elevation gain of over . It is an extremely popular trail, and its access is restricted by quotas from May to October. History View of the summit from Whitney Portal, where the Mount Whitney Trail begins. The start of the switchbacks near Trail Camp. Mount Muir is in the background Some of the 99 switchbacks approaching Trail Crest. Trail Camp is adjacent to the small lake to the left. One steep section of the Mount Whitney Trail is protected by cable handrails From eastern edge of summit looking south. The original pack trail from Lone Pine to the summit of Mount Whitney was designed by local engineer Gustave Marsh. This original trail, opened on July 22, 1904, was the basis for most of today's Mount Whitney Trail. Route The Mount Whitney Trail starts at Whitney Portal. The long trail is non-technical when free of snow and ice, usually from July to late September, but is a strenuous hike that requires good physical fitness. The round-trip hike generally lasts about 12 to 14 hours.\\"Mt. Whitney Overview\\". recreation.gov. Retrieved August 18, 2019. The trail does not follow the most direct route used by mountaineers along the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek, but rather the easier grade along the main branch of Lone Pine Creek to its source. The trail continues along 97 switchbacks to the Sierra crest about south of the summit. The trail then traverses very close to the ridgeline until reaching the summit plateau. This longer route allows for a standard hiking trail with a modest gradient. During peak season the trail is well-maintained and easy to follow. The trail loses a small amount of elevation beyond Trail Crest that is gained on the return. In this final stretch of the trail, on the west side of Whitney's needle-like south ridge, some sections of the trail must be rebuilt after each winter. The views of the interior High Sierra from the ridgeline are expansive, due to the elevation and precipitous exposure. The trail ends at the Smithsonian Institution Shelter on the summit of Mount Whitney.Wenk, Elizabeth, One Best Hike: Mt. Whitney (Wilderness Press, Berkeley, 2008) Management The Mount Whitney Trail, from above Lone Pine Lake to Trail Crest, lies within the special Mount Whitney Zone of the Inyo National Forest. Due to the high volume of trail users, the Forest Service enforces special regulations here to preserve Whitney's wild character. Wilderness permits are always required to use the trail, and between May 1 and November 1, a quota permits only 60 overnight users and 100 day users per day. Beginning in 2012, the Mt. Whitney permit lottery switched over from mail-in applications to an online format. Camping Camping is allowed along most of the trail, more than from water, but level ground that meets that description is extremely limited, so most backpackers congregate in two camps. Outpost Camp, the lower of the two camps, is by trail from Whitney Portal, at . It is sheltered by trees, near a waterfall and Bighorn Meadow. Trail Camp is from the trail head at , in a rocky, often windy, alpine basin. This is also the last place where there is a reliable water source. The lake at Trail Camp has algae from the human waste deposits and is usually purified before drinking. A water pump or purifying and neutralizing tablets work well. Depending on conditions, clean water may be found in springs on the switchbacks. Most overnight backpackers will take between 2 and 4 days to complete this trip. Human waste Human waste management was a major problem at Mount Whitney, and in 2006 the Inyo National Forest instituted a mandatory \\"pack it out\\" program. The Forest Service removed the solar latrines at Outpost Camp and Trail Camp, and instead began issuing \\"WAG Bags\\" (Waste Alleviation and Gelling) to trail users for human waste. Bear canisters From May 25 to October 31, backpackers are required to carry a bear-resistant canister; these can be rented at the Interagency Visitors Center south of Lone Pine or the Whitney Portal Store for a nominal fee. Black bears are common along the Mount Whitney Trail. Night sightings of these bears are not unusual. When traveling at night, hikers are advised to wield a bright headlight and a shrill whistle; making many strange, loud noises will alert the bears to human presence. If possible, hikers should travel in a larger group as bears are much less likely to approach a group than a single person. Weather The High Sierra, including Mount Whitney, has unpredictable weather patterns. Thunderstorms and lightning are a frequent occurrence at the peak on summer afternoons.

These groups play an important role in geometric group theory. Outer space Out(Fn) acts geometrically on a cell complex known as Culler‚ÄìVogtmann Outer space, which can be thought of as the Teichm√ºller space for a bouquet of circles. Definition A point of the outer space is essentially an \\\\R-graph X homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of n circles together with a certain choice of a free homotopy class of a homotopy equivalence from X to the bouquet of n circles. An \\\\R-graph is just a weighted graph with weights in \\\\R. The sum of all weights should be 1 and all weights should be positive. To avoid ambiguity (and to get a finite dimensional space) it is furthermore required that the valency of each vertex should be at least 3\\\\. A more descriptive view avoiding the homotopy equivalence f is the following. We may fix an identification of the fundamental group of the bouquet of n circles with the free group F_n in n variables. Furthermore, we may choose a maximal tree in X and choose for each remaining edge a direction. We will now assign to each remaining edge e a word in F_n in the following way. Consider the closed path starting with e and then going back to the origin of e in the maximal tree. Composing this path with f we get a closed path in a bouquet of n circles and hence an element in its fundamental group F_n. This element is not well defined; if we change f by a free homotopy we obtain another element. It turns out, that those two elements are conjugate to each other, and hence we can choose the unique cyclically reduced element in this conjugacy class. It is possible to reconstruct the free homotopy type of f from these data. This view has the advantage, that it avoids the extra choice of f and has the disadvantage that additional ambiguity arises, because one has to choose a maximal tree and an orientation of the remaining edges. The operation of Out(Fn) on the outer space is defined as follows. Every automorphism g of F_n induces a self homotopy equivalence g‚Ä≤ of the bouquet of n circles. Composing f with g‚Ä≤ gives the desired action. And in the other model it is just application of g and making the resulting word cyclically reduced. Connection to length functions Every point in the outer space determines a unique length function l_X \\\\colon F_n \\\\to \\\\R. A word in F_n determines via the chosen homotopy equivalence a closed path in X. The length of the word is then the minimal length of a path in the free homotopy class of that closed path. Such a length function is constant on each conjugacy class. The assignment X \\\\mapsto l_X defines an embedding of the outer space to some infinite dimensional projective space. Simplicial structure on the outer space In the second model an open simplex is given by all those \\\\R-graphs, which have combinatorically the same underlying graph and the same edges are labeled with the same words (only the length of the edges may differ). The boundary simplices of such a simplex consists of all graphs, that arise from this graph by collapsing an edge. If that edge is a loop it cannot be collapsed without changing the homotopy type of the graph. Hence there is no boundary simplex. So one can think about the outer space as a simplicial complex with some simplices removed. It is easy to verify, that the action of \\\\mathrm{Out}(F_n) is simplicial and has finite isotropy groups. Structure The abelianization map F_n \\\\to \\\\Z^n induces a homomorphism from \\\\mathrm{Out}(F_n) to the general linear group \\\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\\\Z), the latter being the automorphism group of \\\\Z^n. This map is onto, making \\\\mathrm{Out}(F_n) a group extension, :1\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Tor}(F_n) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Out}(F_n) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\\\Z)\\\\to 1. The kernel \\\\mathrm{Tor}(F_n) is the Torelli group of F_n. In the case n= 2, the map \\\\mathrm{Out}(F_n) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{GL}(n,\\\\Z) is an isomorphism. Analogy with mapping class groups Because F_n is the fundamental group of a bouquet of n circles, \\\\mathrm{Out}(F_n) can be described topologically as the mapping class group of a bouquet of n circles (in the homotopy category), in analogy to the mapping class group of a closed surface which is isomorphic to the outer automorphism group of the fundamental group of that surface.

Born in Kutaisi, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), Nadiradze studied law at the University of Moscow from 1912 to 1916. Upon his return to Georgia, he became a founding member of the Georgian Symbolist group Tsisperqantselebi () or 'Blue Horns' in 1915, with fellow writers Grigol Robakidze, Titsian Tabidze, Paolo Iashvili and Valerian Gaprindashvili, amongst others. Nadiradze quickly came under the influence of modernism, particularly Emile Verhaeren, and emerged as one of the leading figures within the Blue Horns group. His early Symbolist poetry was marked by a mystic aesthete with a notably critical and hopeless vision of pre-independence Georgia. His first poem published by the Blue Horn Journal, Dreaming of Georgia (·Éù·É™·Éú·Éî·Éë·Éê ·É°·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éù·Éñ·Éî), 1916, for instance, described a withered Georgian landscape of decrepit homes and crumbling ruins. Prior to Georgia's brief independence (1918-1921) Nadiraze described the country as an 'idiot homeland,with a thankless task/ Aged, oppressed and tortured'Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History: 2nd edition, pp. 243-4. Routledge, . In 1921, the Red Army invaded Georgia and established a Soviet state. Since Nadiradze's earlier writings were not overtly political, he was able to adapt to the Communist ideological requirements more easily than others of the Blue Horn group, and continued to produce poetry.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History: 2nd edition, pp. 243-4. Routledge, . Under the Soviet Union, Nadiradze chiefly wrote patriotic poetry and prose, with a focus on realism and social issues. He also made numerous translations of literary works, including Pushkin, Bunin, Bal'mont, Blok, Verlaine and Isahakyan. Despite Nadiradze adherence to the regime, he was arrested along with the fellow symbolist writer Sergo Kldiashvili in the purge of 1937, although both poets escaped imprisoment when their NKVD interrogator was himself arrested and their files mislaid. The incident caused Nadiradze to distance himself further from old writers of the Blue Horn group, and he would be the last surviving member.http://rustaveli.tripod.com/lithistory.html In the perestroika years, already in his nineties, Nadiradze was able to publish his suppressed works from his early twenties, notably 25 February (25 ·Éó·Éî·Éë·Éî·É†·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éò) a short reaction to the Bolshevik takeover in 1921.

He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly beginning in 2006, representing the electorates of Kawana (2006‚Äì2009) and Buderim (2009‚Äì2017). First elected for the Liberal Party, he joined the Liberal National Party in the 2008 merger, but switched to Pauline Hanson's One Nation in January 2017. He subsequently lost his seat to the LNP candidate at the 2017 election. Dickson served as Minister for National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing in the Campbell Newman government from 2012 to 2015.  Political career  Dickson was a small business owner until his election as a divisional councillor for Maroochy Shire in 2000. He acted as a chair for town planning and a board member of the combined Maroochy/Caloundra Water Board. In 2006 he entered state politics, taking the seat of Kawana and defeating sitting ALP member Chris Cummins with a 7% swing. He was a vocal supporter of a merger between the Liberal and National Parties. He was a member of the Liberal Party until the merger of the Liberal and National parties, whereupon he became a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland. On 12 August 2008, he became Shadow Minister for Workplace and Job Security. In the 2009 state election, he transferred to the seat of Buderim. In 2011 he was appointed Shadow Minister for Energy and Water Utilities. On 13 January 2017, Dickson announced that he had resigned from the Liberal National Party due to his conflict with the party over medical cannabis. He announced he would be joining Pauline Hanson's One Nation. Following his announcement, the LNP advised it was investigating an allegation that Dickson had downloaded 52 internal documents from the party's secure site hours before his resignation from the party. In the run up to the 2017 Queensland State elections, and in the presence of Pauline Hanson, Dickson erroneously stated about the Safe Schools program: \\"We are having little kids in grade four at school, young girls being taught by teachers how to masturbate, how to strap on dildos, how to do this sort of stuff ‚Äî that is the real problem in this country.\\" Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk immediately called those claims \\"absolutely atrocious\\" and \\"complete nonsense\\". Dickson went on to liken an adult sex shop (Cupids Cabin) to a \\"newsagency which can sell Playboy-style magazines\\". He lost his seat to LNP candidate Brent Mickelberg at the 2017 election. Despite losing his seat, he remained the state leader of the party. In August 2020, Dickson announced that he would run for his previous seat of Buderim in the upcoming 2020 Queensland election as an independent.  One Nation/National Rifle Association scandal  In March 2019, it was revealed that Dickson had been secretly captured on video with James Ashby (One Nation's Media Advisor) courting the American National Rifle Association (NRA) seeking funds for Pauline Hanson's One Nation, with the promise to weaken Australia's gun laws if they gained the balance of power in the Australian parliament. Al Jazeera conducted a 3-year long operation to uncover this activity, by having a person called Rodger Muller pose as the head of a fake gun lobby group 'Gun Rights Australia', then having Muller record meetings he attended with Dickson and James Ashby, where strategies to seek support from the National Rifle Association and at least one of their large corporate benefactor were discussed. The footage from these meetings were used to produce an episode for Al Jazeera English, titled How to Sell a Massacre (part 1). During Ashby and Dickson's meeting with NRA's Public Relations team, Lars Dalseide (NRA Media Liaison), suggests to Dickson tactics to use in the wake of any mass shootings in Australia. In reply to Dalseide's suggested line, \\"How dare you stand on the graves of those children and put forth your political agenda?\\" Dickson replies, \\"I love that.\\" Dalseide; \\"If your policy isn‚Äôt good enough to stand on its own, how dare you use their deaths to push that forward?\\" Ashby; \\"That‚Äôs really good. That‚Äôs really strong.\\" While meeting with the NRA, Dickson made derogatory remarks about Muslim immigrants to Australia, claiming they are criminals and killers; he called members of the Greens Party \\"fucktards\\". Though both Ashby and Dickson declined Al Jazeera's invitation to comment on the footage, ABC news reported that, 'In a statement, Mr Ashby has accused Al Jazeera of being \\"a state-owned propaganda arm of the Qatari Government that supports Islamic extremist groups and are not a legitimate media organisation\\". \\"The matter has been referred to ASIO and the Australian Federal Police due to concerns of foreign interference into Australian politics in the lead-up to the imminent federal election.\\" \\"It is understood One Nation was targeted because of its strong approach to reducing immigration numbers and a travel ban on countries with terrorism links.\\" \\"One Nation strongly supports the rights of lawful gun ownership within Australia and have clearly outlined our policy on our website.\\" \\"One Nation members have always complied with the law.\\" A further public statement was made by Ashby and Dickson on 26 March 2019, in which the pair excused themselves on the grounds of being drunk at the time. Further footage was leaked of Dickson at a Washington, D.C. strip club attempting to solicit sexual favours, groping a dancer's breasts and making derogatory comments towards dancers and other women. In the video, from which excerpts were aired on Channel Nine's A Current Affair on 29 April 2019, Dickson is heard saying \\"I've done more Asian than I know what to do with.\\" In a statement the day after the broadcast, Dickson apologised for his behaviour and announced his resignation from One Nation.  Personal life  Dickson's son Christian was also a politician.

The Outer space, denoted Xn or CVn, comes equipped with a natural action of the group of outer automorphisms Out(Fn) of Fn. The Outer space was introduced in a 1986 paper, of Marc Culler and Karen Vogtmann and it serves as a free group analog of the Teichm√ºller space of a hyperbolic surface. Outer space is used to study homology and cohomology groups of Out(Fn) and to obtain information about algebraic, geometric and dynamical properties of Out(Fn), of its subgroups and individual outer automorphisms of Fn. The space Xn can also be thought of as the set of Fn-equivariant isometry types of minimal free discrete isometric actions of Fn on Fn on R-trees T such that the quotient metric graph T/Fn has volume 1. History The Outer space X_n was introduced in a 1986 paper, of Marc Culler and Karen Vogtmann, inspired by analogy with the Teichm√ºller space of a hyperbolic surface. They showed that the natural action of \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n) on X_n is properly discontinuous, and that X_n is contractible. In the same paper Culler and Vogtmann constructed an embedding, via the translation length functions discussed below, of X_n into the infinite dimensional projective space \\\\mathbb P^\\\\mathcal C=\\\\mathbb R^\\\\mathcal C-{0}/\\\\mathbb R_{>0} , where \\\\mathcal C is the set of nontrivial conjugacy classes of elements of F_n. They also proved that the closure \\\\overline X_n of X_n in \\\\mathbb P^\\\\mathcal C is compact. Later a combination of the results of Cohen and Lustig and of Bestvina and Feighn identified (see Section 1.3 of )the space \\\\overline X_n with the space \\\\overline{CV}_n of projective classes of \\"very small\\" minimal isometric actions of F_n on \\\\mathbb R-trees. Formal definition=Marked metric graphs Let n ‚â• 2. For the free group Fn fix a \\"rose\\" Rn, that is a wedge, of n circles wedged at a vertex v, and fix an isomorphism between Fn and the fundamental group 1(Rn, v) of Rn. From this point on we identify Fn and 1(Rn, v) via this isomorphism. A marking on Fn consists of a homotopy equivalence f : Rn ‚Üí Œì where Œì is a finite connected graph without degree-one and degree-two vertices. Up to a (free) homotopy, f is uniquely determined by the isomorphism f# : 1(Rn) ‚Üí 1(Œì), that is by an isomorphism Fn ‚Üí 1(Œì). A metric graph is a finite connected graph \\\\gamma together with the assignment to every topological edge e of Œì of a positive real number L(e) > 0 called the length of e. The volume of a metric graph is the sum of the lengths of its topological edges. A marked metric graph structure on Fn consists of a marking f : Rn ‚Üí Œì together with a metric graph structure L on Œì. Two marked metric graph structures f1 : Rn ‚Üí Œì1 and f2 : Rn ‚Üí Œì2 are equivalent if there exists an isometry Œ∏ : Œì1 ‚Üí Œì2 such that, up to free homotopy, we have Œ∏ o f1 = f2. The Outer space Xn consists of equivalence classes of all the volume-one marked metric graph structures on Fn. Weak topology on the Outer spaceOpen simplices= Let f : Rn ‚Üí Œì where Œì is a marking and let k be the number of topological edges in Œì. We order the edges of Œì as e1,..., ek. Let :\\\\Delta_k=\\\\left{ (x_1,\\\\dots, x_k)\\\\in \\\\mathbb R^k \\\\,\\\\Big\\\\, \\\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i =1, x_i >0 \\\\text{ for } i=1,\\\\dots, k\\\\right} be the standard (k ‚àí 1)-dimensional open simplex in Rk. Given f, there is a natural map j : Œîk ‚Üí Xn, where for x = (x1,..., xk) ‚àà Œîk, the point j(x) of Xn is given by the marking f together with the metric graph structure L on Œì such that L(ei) = xi for i = 1,...,k. One can show that j is in fact an injective map, that is, distinct points of Œîk correspond to non-equivalent marked metric graph structures on Fn. The set j(Œîk) is called open simplex in Xn corresponding to f and is denoted S(f). By construction, Xn is the union of open simplices corresponding to all markings on Fn. Note that two open simplices in Xn either are disjoint or coincide. =Closed simplices= Let f : Rn ‚Üí Œì where Œì is a marking and let k be the number of topological edges in Œì. As before, we order the edges of Œì as e1,..., ek. Define Œîk‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ Rk as the set of all x = (x1,..., xk) ‚àà Rk, such that \\\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i=1, such that each xi ‚â• 0 and such that the set of all edges ei in \\\\Gamma with xi = 0 is a subforest in Œì. The map j : Œîk ‚Üí Xn extends to a map h : Œîk‚Ä≤ ‚Üí Xn as follows. For x in Œîk put h(x) = j(x). For x ‚àà Œîk‚Ä≤ ‚àí Œîk the point h(x) of Xn is obtained by taking the marking f, contracting all edges ei of \\\\Gamma with xi = 0 to obtain a new marking f1 : Rn ‚Üí Œì1 and then assigning to each surviving edge ei of Œì1 length xi > 0. It can be shown that for every marking f the map h : Œîk‚Ä≤ ‚Üí Xn is still injective. The image of h is called the closed simplex in Xn corresponding to f and is denoted by S‚Ä≤(f). Every point in Xn belongs to only finitely many closed simplices and a point of Xn represented by a marking f : Rn ‚Üí Œì where the graph Œì is tri-valent belongs to a unique closed simplex in Xn, namely S‚Ä≤(f). The weak topology on the Outer space Xn is defined by saying that a subset C of Xn is closed if and only if for every marking f : Rn ‚Üí Œì the set h‚àí1(C) is closed in Œîk‚Ä≤. In particular, the map h : Œîk‚Ä≤ ‚Üí Xn is a topological embedding. Points of Outer space as actions on trees Let x be a point in Xn given by a marking f : Rn ‚Üí Œì with a volume-one metric graph structure L on Œì. Let T be the universal cover of Œì. Thus T is a simply connected graph, that is T is a topological tree. We can also lift the metric structure L to T by giving every edge of T the same length as the length of its image in Œì. This turns T into a metric space (T,d) which is a real tree. The fundamental group 1(Œì) acts on T by covering transformations which are also isometries of (T,d), with the quotient space T/1(Œì) = Œì. Since the induced homomorphism f# is an isomorphism between Fn = 1(Rn) and 1(Œì), we also obtain an isometric action of Fn on T with T/Fn = Œì. This action is free and discrete. Since Œì is a finite connected graph with no degree-one vertices, this action is also minimal, meaning that T has no proper Fn-invariant subtrees. Moreover, every minimal free and discrete isometric action of Fn on a real tree with the quotient being a metric graph of volume one arises in this fashion from some point x of Xn. This defines a bijective correspondence between Xn and the set of equivalence classes of minimal free and discrete isometric actions of Fn on a real trees with volume-one quotients. Here two such actions of Fn on real trees T1 and T2 are equivalent if there exists an Fn-equivariant isometry between T1 and T2. =Length functions= Give an action of Fn on a real tree T as above, one can define the translation length function associate with this action: :\\\\ell_T: F_n \\\\to \\\\mathbb R, \\\\quad \\\\ell_T(g)=\\\\min_{t\\\\in T} d(t,gt), \\\\quad\\\\text{ for } g\\\\in F_n. For g ‚â† 1 there is a (unique) isometrically embedded copy of R in T, called the axis of g, such that g acts on this axis by a translation of magnitude \\\\ell_T(g)>0. For this reason \\\\ell_T(g) is called the translation length of g. For any g, u in Fn we have \\\\ell_T(ugu^{-1})=\\\\ell_T(g), that is the function \\\\ell_T is constant on each conjugacy class in G. In the marked metric graph model of Outer space translation length functions can be interpreted as follows. Let T in Xn be represented by a marking f : Rn ‚Üí Œì with a volume-one metric graph structure L on Œì. Let g ‚àà Fn = 1(Rn). First push g forward via f# to get a closed loop in Œì and then tighten this loop to an immersed circuit in Œì. The L-length of this circuit is the translation length \\\\ell_T(g) of g. A basic general fact from the theory of group actions on real trees says that a point of the Outer space is uniquely determined by its translation length function. Namely if two trees with minimal free isometric actions of Fn define equal translation length functions on Fn then the two trees are Fn-equivariantly isometric. Hence the map T\\\\mapsto \\\\ell_T from Xn to the set of R-valued functions on Fn is injective. One defines the length function topology or axes topology on Xn as follows. For every T in Xn, every finite subset K of Fn and every Œµ > 0 let : V_T(K,\\\\epsilon)= { T'\\\\in X_n: \\\\ell_T(g)-\\\\ell_{T'}(g) < \\\\epsilon \\\\text{ for every } g\\\\in K}. In the length function topology for every T in Xn a basis of neighborhoods of T in Xn is given by the family VT(K, Œµ) where K is a finite subset of Fn and where Œµ > 0. Convergence of sequences in the length function topology can be characterized as follows. For T in Xn and a sequence Ti in Xn we have \\\\lim_{i\\\\to\\\\infty} T_i =T if and only if for every g in Fn we have \\\\lim_{i\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\ell_{T_i}(g)=\\\\ell_T(g). Gromov topology Another topology on X_n is the so-called Gromov topology or the equivariant Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff convergence topology, which provides a version of Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff convergence adapted to the setting of an isometric group action. When defining the Gromov topology, one should think of points of X_n as actions of F_n on \\\\mathbb R-trees. Informally, given a tree T\\\\in X_n, another tree T'\\\\in X_n is \\"close\\" to T in the Gromov topology, if for some large finite subtrees of Y\\\\subseteq T, Y'\\\\subseteq T'\\\\in X_n and a large finite subset B\\\\subseteq F_n there exists an \\"almost isometry\\" between Y' and Y with respect to which the (partial) actions of B on Y' and Y almost agree. For the formal definition of the Gromov topology see.Fr√©d√©ric Paulin, The Gromov topology on R-trees. Topology and its Applications 32 (1989), no. 3, 197‚Äì221. =Coincidence of the weak, the length function and Gromov topologies= An important basic result states that the Gromov topology, the weak topology and the length function topology on Xn coincide.Vincent Guirardel, Gilbert Levitt, Deformation spaces of trees. Groups, Geometry, and Dynamics 1 (2007), no. 2, 135‚Äì181. Action of Out(Fn) on Outer space The group Out(Fn) admits a natural right action by homeomorphisms on Xn. First we define the action of the automorphism group Aut(Fn) on Xn. Let Œ± ‚àà Aut(Fn) be an automorphism of Fn. Let x be a point of Xn given by a marking f : Rn ‚Üí Œì with a volume-one metric graph structure L on Œì. Let œÑ : Rn ‚Üí Rn be a homotopy equivalence whose induced homomorphism at the fundamental group level is the automorphism Œ± of Fn = 1(Rn). The element xŒ± of Xn is given by the marking f o œÑ : Rn ‚Üí Œì with the metric structure L on Œì. That is, to get x Œ± from x we simply precompose the marking defining x with œÑ. In the real tree model this action can be described as follows. Let T in Xn be a real tree with a minimal free and discrete co-volume-one isometric action of Fn. Let Œ± ‚àà Aut(Fn). As a metric space, TŒ± is equal to T. The action of Fn is twisted by Œ±. Namely, for any t in T and g in Fn we have: : g\\\\underset{T\\\\alpha}{\\\\cdot} t= \\\\alpha(g) \\\\underset{T}{\\\\cdot} t. At the level of translation length functions the tree TŒ± is given as: :\\\\ell_{T\\\\alpha}(g)=\\\\ell_T(\\\\alpha(g)) \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } g\\\\in F_n. One then checks that for the above action of Aut(Fn) on Outer space Xn the subgroup of inner automorphisms Inn(Fn) is contained in the kernel of this action, that is every inner automorphism acts trivially on Xn. It follows that the action of Aut(Fn) on Xn quotients through to an action of Out(Fn) = Aut(Fn)/Inn(Fn) on Xn. namely, if œÜ ‚àà Out(Fn) is an outer automorphism of Fn and if Œ± in Aut(Fn) is an actual automorphism representing œÜ then for any x in Xn we have xœÜ = xŒ±. The right action of Out(Fn) on Xn can be turned into a left action via a standard conversion procedure. Namely, for œÜ ‚àà Out(Fn) and x in Xn set :œÜ x = x œÜ‚àí1. This left action of Out(Fn) on Xn is also sometimes considered in the literature although most sources work with the right action. Moduli space The quotient space Mn = Xn/Out(Fn) is the moduli space which consists of isometry types of finite connected graphs Œì without degree- one and degree-two vertices, with fundamental groups isomorphic to Fn (that is, with the first Betti number equal to n) equipped with volume-one metric structures. The quotient topology on Mn is the same as that given by the Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff distance between metric graphs representing points of Mn. The moduli space Mn is not compact and the \\"cusps\\" in Mn arise from decreasing towards zero lengths of edges for homotopically nontrivial subgraphs (e.g. an essential circuit) of a metric graph Œì. Basic properties and facts about Outer space * Outer space Xn is contractible and the action of Out(Fn) on Xn is properly discontinuous, as was proved by Culler and Vogtmann in their original 1986 paper where Outer space was introduced. * The space Xn has topological dimension 3n ‚àí 4\\\\. The reason is that if Œì is a finite connected graph without degree-one and degree-two vertices with fundamental group isomorphic to Fn, then Œì has at most 3n ‚àí 3 edges and it has exactly 3n ‚àí 3 edges when Œì is trivalent. Hence the top-dimensional open simplex in Xn has dimension 3n ‚àí 4\\\\. * Outer space Xn contains a specific deformation retract Kn of Xn, called the spine of Outer space. The spine Kn has dimension 2n ‚àí 3, is Out(Fn)-invariant and has compact quotient under the action of Out(Fn). Unprojectivized Outer space The unprojectivized Outer space cv_n consists of equivalence classes of all marked metric graph structures on Fn where the volume of the metric graph in the marking is allowed to be any positive real number. The space cv_n can also be thought of as the set of all free minimal discrete isometric actions of Fn on R-trees, considered up to Fn-equivariant isometry. The unprojectivized Outer space inherits the same structures that X_n has, including the coincidence of the three topologies (Gromov, axes, weak), and an \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)-action. In addition, there is a natural action of \\\\mathbb R_{>0} on cv_n by scalar multiplication. Topologically, cv_n is homeomorphic to X_n\\\\times (0,\\\\infty). In particular, cv_n is also contractible. Projectivized Outer space The projectivized Outer space is the quotient space CV_n:=cv_n/\\\\mathbb R_{>0} under the action of \\\\mathbb R_{>0} on cv_n by scalar multiplication. The space CV_n is equipped with the quotient topology. For a tree T\\\\in cv_n its projective equivalence class is denoted [T]={cTc>0}\\\\subseteq cv_n. The action of \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n) on cv_n naturally quotients through to the action of \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n) on CV_n. Namely, for \\\\phi\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n) and T\\\\in cv_n put [T]\\\\phi:= [T\\\\phi]. A key observation is that the map X_n\\\\to CV_n, T\\\\mapsto [T] is an \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)-equivariant homeomorphism. For this reason the spaces X_n and CV_n are often identified. Lipschitz distance The Lipschitz distance, named for Rudolf Lipschitz, for Outer space corresponds to the Thurston metric in Teichm√ºller space. For two points x,y in Xn the (right) Lipschitz distance d_R is defined as the (natural) logarithm of the maximally stretched closed path from x to y: :\\\\Lambda_R(x,y):=\\\\sup_{\\\\gamma \\\\in F_n\\\\setminus {1}} \\\\frac{\\\\ell_y(\\\\gamma)}{\\\\ell_x(\\\\gamma)} and d_R(x,y):= \\\\log \\\\Lambda_R(x,y) This is an asymmetric metric (also sometimes called a quasimetric), i.e. it only fails symmetry d_R(x,y)=d_R(y,x). The symmetric Lipschitz metric normally denotes: :d(x,y):=d_R(x,y)+d_R(y,x) The supremum \\\\Lambda_R(x,y) is always obtained and can be calculated by a finite set the so called candidates of x. :\\\\Lambda_R(x,y)=\\\\max_{\\\\gamma \\\\in cand(x)} \\\\frac{\\\\ell_y(\\\\gamma)}{\\\\ell_x(\\\\gamma)} simple loop, a figure of eight, and a barbell Where cand(x) is the finite set of conjugacy classes in Fn which correspond to embeddings of a simple loop, a figure of eight, or a barbell into x via the marking. The stretching factor also equals the minimal Lipschitz constant of a homotopy equivalence carrying over the marking, i.e. :\\\\Lambda_R(x,y)=\\\\min_{h \\\\in H(x,y)} Lip(h) Where H(x,y) are the continuous functions h: x \\\\to y such that for the marking f_x on x the marking h \\\\circ f_x is freely homotopic to the marking f_y on y. The induced topology is the same as the weak topology and the isometry group is \\\\operatorname{Out}(F_n) for both, the symmetric and asymmetric Lipschitz distance. Applications and generalizations * The closure \\\\overline{cv}_n of cv_n in the length function topology is known to consists of (Fn-equivariant isometry classes) of all very small minimal isometric actions of Fn on R-trees.Mladen Bestvina, The topology of Out(Fn). Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vol. II (Beijing, 2002), pp. 373-384, Higher Ed. Press, Beijing, 2002; . Here the closure is taken in the space of all minimal isometric \\"irreducible\\" actions of F_n on \\\\mathbb R-trees, considered up-to equivariant isometry. It is known that the Gromov topology and the axes topology on the space of irreducible actions coincide, so the closure can be understood in either sense. The projectivization of \\\\overline{cv}_n with respect to multiplication by positive scalars gives the space \\\\overline{CV}_n which is the length function compactification of CV_n and of X_n , analogous to Thurston's compactification of the Teichm√ºller space. * Analogs and generalizations of the Outer space have been developed for free products, for right-angled Artin groups,Ruth Charney, Nathaniel Stambaugh, Karen Vogtmann, Outer space for untwisted automorphisms of right-angled Artin groups, arXiv:1212.4791, preprint, 2012 for the so-called deformation spaces of group actions and in some other contexts. * A base-pointed version of Outer space, called Auter space, for marked metric graphs with base-points, was constructed by Hatcher and Vogtmann in 1998.Allen Hatcher, and Karen Vogtmann, Cerf theory for graphs. Journal of the London Mathematical Society 58 (1998), no. 3, 633‚Äì655. The Auter space A_n shares many properties in common with the Outer space, but A_n only comes with an action of Aut(F_n).

Two metric spaces are quasi-isometric if there exists a quasi- isometry between them. The property of being quasi-isometric behaves like an equivalence relation on the class of metric spaces. The concept of quasi- isometry is especially important in geometric group theory, following the work of Gromov. lattice is quasi-isometric to the plane. Definition Suppose that f is a (not necessarily continuous) function from one metric space (M_1,d_1) to a second metric space (M_2,d_2). Then f is called a quasi- isometry from (M_1,d_1) to (M_2,d_2) if there exist constants A\\\\ge 1, B\\\\ge 0, and C\\\\ge 0 such that the following two properties both hold:P. de la Harpe, Topics in geometric group theory.

More formally: #:\\\\forall x,y\\\\in M_1: \\\\frac{1}{A}\\\\; d_1(x,y)-B\\\\leq d_2(f(x),f(y))\\\\leq A\\\\; d_1(x,y)+B. #Every point of M_2 is within the constant distance C of an image point.

The two metric spaces (M_1,d_1) and (M_2,d_2) are called quasi-isometric if there exists a quasi- isometry f from (M_1,d_1) to (M_2,d_2). A map is called a quasi-isometric embedding if it satisfies the first condition but not necessarily the second (i.e. it is coarsely Lipschitz but may fail to be coarsely surjective). In other words, if through the map, (M_1,d_1) is quasi-isometric to a subspace of (M_2,d_2). Two metric spaces M1 and M2 are said to be quasi-isometric, denoted M_1\\\\underset{q.i.}{\\\\sim} M_2 , if there exists a quasi-isometry f:M_1\\\\to M_2. Examples The map between the Euclidean plane and the plane with the Manhattan distance that sends every point to itself is a quasi-isometry: in it, distances are multiplied by a factor of at most \\\\sqrt 2. Note that there can be no isometry, since, for example, the points (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1) are of equal distance to each other in Manhattan distance, but in the Euclidea plane, there are no 4 points that are of equal distance to each other. The map f:\\\\mathbb{Z}^n\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R}^n (both with the Euclidean metric) that sends every n-tuple of integers to itself is a quasi-isometry: distances are preserved exactly, and every real tuple is within distance \\\\sqrt{n/4} of an integer tuple. In the other direction, the discontinuous function that rounds every tuple of real numbers to the nearest integer tuple is also a quasi-isometry: each point is taken by this map to a point within distance \\\\sqrt{n/4} of it, so rounding changes the distance between pairs of points by adding or subtracting at most 2\\\\sqrt{n/4}. Every pair of finite or bounded metric spaces is quasi-isometric. In this case, every function from one space to the other is a quasi-isometry. Equivalence relation If f:M_1\\\\mapsto M_2 is a quasi-isometry, then there exists a quasi-isometry g:M_2\\\\mapsto M_1. Indeed, g(x) may be defined by letting y be any point in the image of f that is within distance C of x, and letting g(x) be any point in f^{-1}(y). Since the identity map is a quasi-isometry, and the composition of two quasi-isometries is a quasi-isometry, it follows that the property of being quasi-isometric behaves like an equivalence relation on the class of metric spaces. Use in geometric group theory Given a finite generating set S of a finitely generated group G, we can form the corresponding Cayley graph of S and G. This graph becomes a metric space if we declare the length of each edge to be 1. Taking a different finite generating set T results in a different graph and a different metric space, however the two spaces are quasi-isometric.R.B. Sher and R.J. Daverman (2002), Handbook of Geometric Topology, North-Holland. . This quasi-isometry class is thus an invariant of the group G. Any property of metric spaces that only depends on a space's quasi-isometry class immediately yields another invariant of groups, opening the field of group theory to geometric methods. More generally, the ≈†varc‚ÄìMilnor lemma states that if a group G acts properly discontinuously with compact quotient on a proper geodesic space X then G is quasi-isometric to X (meaning that any Cayley graph for G is). This gives new examples of groups quasi-isometric to each other: * If G' is a subgroup of finite index in G then G' is quasi-isometric to G; * If G and H are the fundamental groups of two compact hyperbolic manifolds of the same dimension d then they are both quasi- isometric to the hyperbolic space Hd and hence to each other; on the other hand there are infinitely many quasi-isometry classes of fundamental groups of finite-volume.  Quasigeodesics and the Morse lemma  A quasi-geodesic in a metric space (X, d) is a quasi-isometric embedding of \\\\mathbb R into X. More precisely a map \\\\phi: \\\\mathbb R \\\\to X such that there exists C,K > 0 so that :\\\\forall s, t \\\\in \\\\mathbb R : C^{-1} s - t - K \\\\le d(\\\\phi(t), \\\\phi(s)) \\\\le Cs - t + K is called a (C,K)-quasi-geodesic. Obviously geodesics (parametrised by arclength) are quasi-geodesics. The fact that in some spaces the converse is coarsely true, i.e. that every quasi-geodesic stays within bounded distance of a true geodesic, is called the Morse Lemma (not to be confused with the perhaps more widely known Morse lemma in differential topology). Formally the statement is: :Let \\\\delta, C, K > 0 and X a proper Œ¥-hyperbolic space. There exists M such that for any (C, K)-quasi-geodesic there exists a geodesic L in X such that d(\\\\phi(t), L) \\\\le M for all t \\\\in \\\\mathbb R. It is an important tool in geometric group theory. An immediate application is that any quasi-isometry between proper hyperbolic spaces induces a homeomorphism between their boundaries. This result is the first step in the proof of the Mostow rigidity theorem. Examples of quasi-isometry invariants of groups The following are some examples of properties of group Cayley graphs that are invariant under quasi-isometry: Hyperbolicity A group is called hyperbolic if one of its Cayley graphs is a Œ¥-hyperbolic space for some Œ¥. When translating between different definitions of hyperbolicity, the particular value of Œ¥ may change, but the resulting notions of a hyperbolic group turn out to be equivalent. Hyperbolic groups have a solvable word problem. They are biautomatic and automatic.: indeed, they are strongly geodesically automatic, that is, there is an automatic structure on the group, where the language accepted by the word acceptor is the set of all geodesic words. Growth The growth rate of a group with respect to a symmetric generating set describes the size of balls in the group. Every element in the group can be written as a product of generators, and the growth rate counts the number of elements that can be written as a product of length n. According to Gromov's theorem, a group of polynomial growth is virtually nilpotent, i.e. it has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. In particular, the order of polynomial growth k_0 has to be a natural number and in fact #(n)\\\\sim n^{k_0}. If #(n) grows more slowly than any exponential function, G has a subexponential growth rate. Any such group is amenable. Ends The ends of a topological space are, roughly speaking, the connected components of the ‚Äúideal boundary‚Äù of the space. That is, each end represents a topologically distinct way to move to infinity within the space. Adding a point at each end yields a compactification of the original space, known as the end compactification. The ends of a finitely generated group are defined to be the ends of the corresponding Cayley graph; this definition is independent of the choice of a finite generating set. Every finitely-generated infinite group has either 0,1, 2, or infinitely many ends, and Stallings theorem about ends of groups provides a decomposition for groups with more than one end. If two connected locally finite graphs are quasi-isometric then they have the same number of ends. In particular, two quasi-isometric finitely generated groups have the same number of ends. Amenability An amenable group is a locally compact topological group G carrying a kind of averaging operation on bounded functions that is invariant under translation by group elements. The original definition, in terms of a finitely additive invariant measure (or mean) on subsets of G, was introduced by John von Neumann in 1929 under the German name \\"messbar\\" (\\"measurable\\" in English) in response to the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox. In 1949 Mahlon M. Day introduced the English translation \\"amenable\\", apparently as a pun.Day's first published use of the word is in his abstract for an AMS summer meeting in 1949, Means on semigroups and groups, Bull. A.M.S. 55 (1949) 1054‚Äì1055. Many text books on amenability, such as Volker Runde's, suggest that Day chose the word as a pun. In discrete group theory, where G has the discrete topology, a simpler definition is used. In this setting, a group is amenable if one can say what proportion of G any given subset takes up. If a group has a F√∏lner sequence then it is automatically amenable. Asymptotic cone An ultralimit is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of metric spaces Xn a limiting metric space. An important class of ultralimits are the so-called asymptotic cones of metric spaces. Let (X,d) be a metric space, let œâ be a non-principal ultrafilter on \\\\mathbb N and let pn ‚àà X be a sequence of base-points. Then the œâ-ultralimit of the sequence (X, \\\\frac{d}{n}, p_n) is called the asymptotic cone of X with respect to œâ and (p_n)_n\\\\, and is denoted Cone_\\\\omega(X,d, (p_n)_n)\\\\,. One often takes the base-point sequence to be constant, pn = p for some p ‚àà X; in this case the asymptotic cone does not depend on the choice of p ‚àà X and is denoted by Cone_\\\\omega(X,d)\\\\, or just Cone_\\\\omega(X)\\\\,. The notion of an asymptotic cone plays an important role in geometric group theory since asymptotic cones (or, more precisely, their topological types and bi-Lipschitz types) provide quasi-isometry invariants of metric spaces in general and of finitely generated groups in particular.John Roe. Lectures on Coarse Geometry. American Mathematical Society, 2003. Asymptotic cones also turn out to be a useful tool in the study of relatively hyperbolic groups and their generalizations.Cornelia Dru≈£u and Mark Sapir (with an Appendix by Denis Osin and Mark Sapir), Tree-graded spaces and asymptotic cones of groups.

At this time he had the nickname \\"Second Hand Clothing Liang\\". It was during this period in 1877 that he became a direct disciple of Baguazhang creator Dong Haichuan. He studied with Dong for about five years and was well liked by all of Dong's students. He had the fortune of not only learning from Dong Haichuan but also from Dong's other students including Cheng Tinghua, Yin Fu, Shi Jidong, and Liu Fengchun. After the death of both parents at age 20, he opened a martial arts kwoon to make a living.:zh:Ê¢ÅÊåØËí≤ In Ji County he defeated the four \\"Batian\\" gangs.

He was subsequently imprisoned and sentenced to death. When the Eight-Nation Alliance army invaded Beijing to crush the Boxer Rebellion his prison was heavily damaged and he managed to escape. Being the youngest of the disciples of Dong, he trained not only with Dong but also with both Yin Fu and Cheng Tinghua, and as a result his style of Baguazhang has some characteristics of both styles. Examples include the Ox Tongue Palm from Yin Style and wrestling movements from Cheng Style.

By 1997 their second release took them from obscurity to the band of choice on line-ups and supports in mere months. In 1998, to support their EP \\"Seasides\\", they embarked on their first Australian tour and featured on ABC Television's 'Recovery'. A change in drummer reinvigorating the band, writing 30 songs in 6 months. They recorded their debut album Turnstyle Country in 1998/99 as a self-funded, unsigned band, eventually signing to Spunk! Records after being turned down by Sony (too weird!). The first single \\"Spray Water On The Stereo\\" gained monumental airplay and TV coverage, Reaching 16 on the ARIA alternative charts. The band toured throughout the year, joining Trans Am on tour and playing the Glenworth Valley Weekender. Over the next two years shows included a tour with Guided By Voices and supporting their heroes Yo La Tengo. Spent musically, in the face of a changing industry and personalities, the band managed one more album, Turnstyle Corporation in 2001 shortly before announcing their breakup. Two sold-out shows heralded what became an 8-year hiatus. The band reunited in 2010, then again in 2013 as a permanent reunion. They released the album Time Equals Function in 2015, mixed and mastered in London by Andy Ramsay of Stereolab. In 2018 Turnstyle released Happy Factories, a crisp record which eschewed pedestrian themes for more contemplative subject matter. The album features vocals by Pavement's Bob Nastanovich on one song.

Originally released in 1986, it was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on August 10, 2007 and in North America on August 21, 2007. It is part of the NES Sports Series.  Gameplay  Volleyball is a sports video game that follows the rules of volleyball. The player controls a team of six players, three at the net and three in back. The player serves the ball into play by pressing the same button twice. The game is a six player-a-side volleyball simulation. Players can select teams to compete in either a men's or women's competition from the following countries: United States, Japan, People's Republic of China, South Korea, Brazil, Soviet Union, Cuba, Tunisia.  Development  Volleyball is based on an arcade game. Volleyball was developed by Pax Soft Nica and Nintendo R&D1; and published by Nintendo. It was released in March 1987.  Reception  Christopher Michael Baker of AllGame rated the game two out of five and said that it showed the developer's inexperience at creating volleyball games. He could not figure out which character he controlled at any given point nor the ball's location as poorly anticipated by its shadow. Baker also criticized the game's \\"annoying\\" sound effects. He said that Nintendo had made games for all other sports and likely felt obliged to make a volleyball game. He ultimately recommended Kings of the Beach and Super Spike V'Ball instead. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said that Volleyball could be Nintendo's worst sports game, worse than even NES Soccer. He said the controls were automatically frustrating.

It is a Statutory Authority and was established by the Geelong Performing Arts Centre Trust Act 1980 No. 9406. The centre has two major theatres, a number of smaller performance spaces, and a bar, restaurant and cafe. It is located between Little Malop and Ryrie Streets in central Geelong. History Alcoa Courtyard Proposals for a performing arts centre in Geelong were first made in the 1970s. The site chosen had a number of existing buildings upon it: Temperance Hall A Temperance Hall was located on the corner of Little Malop Street and Aitchison Place. It was erected in 1858/59, the foundation stone being laid on 15 November 1858. This distinctive conservative classical building with Barrabool freestone facade, ornate central parapet entablature supported on Tuscan Doric pilasters and matching entrance portal was designed by an unknown architect for the Geelong Total Abstinence Society. The Hall was later used as a Grammar School in 1864. The hall was demolished in 1978 to enable the construction of GPAC. The stones were numbered and put into storage for future rebuilding, the current location being unknown. Mechanics' Institute Mechanics Institute building on Ryrie Street, 2007 A meeting was held in 1842 to investigate the opening of a Mechanics' Institute in Geelong. The first building was opened in 1846, with a new building opening on the current site on Ryrie Street on March 3, 1856. At some point the building gained a 2nd storey, before it was destroyed by fire in 1926. A new hall was built on site, and was known as the Plaza Theatre. The facade of this building was retained in GPAC. Steeple Church Rear of the former 'Steeple Church', 2007 Band of Hope building on Ryrie Street, formerly the 'Steeple Church', 2007 The Ryrie Street Presbyterian Church opened in 1857, and was known as the 'Steeple Church'. It was designed by John Young in 1856 and built in bluestone in an Early English Gothic style. In 1914 the congregation moved to Newtown and became St. David's Presbyterian Church. The steeple was dismantled in 1913, and the present row of two-storey shops along Ryrie Street were built, although the main body of the church still exists today as part of the performing arts centre. Arts Centre Construction of the centre commenced in 1978 with the demolition of the Temperance Hall. The centre was designed in a Brutalist style with exposed concrete. It was officially opened in 1981, and consists of a number of separate venues: *The Playhouse (known as Ford Theatre until 2011): 797 seat proscenium arch theatre with dress circle and fly tower. *Drama Theatre (known as Blakiston Theatre until 2011): 325 seat studio-style theatre. *Alcoa Studio: 20.5m x 10m dance studio with a sprung floor, stage and mirrors. It is located in the former Steeple Church. *Ballet Studio 2: 15m x 9m dance studio with a sprung floor, ballet bars and mirrors. It is located in the upstairs area of the former Mechanics' Institute. Sponsorship In order to raise funds for the construction of the centre corporate sponsorship was sought. A number of Geelong companies pledged funds and had sections of the centre named after them. The main theatre was named after major sponsor Ford. The second theatre was named after Blakistons, a local transport company; the main foyer after Shell; and the courtyard after Alcoa. Corporate sponsorship continues to support the running of the centre today. Management The Geelong Arts Centre is a state owned cultural agency that receives funding through the financial assistance of the Victorian Government through Creative Victoriat. The centre is managed by the members of the Geelong Performing Arts Centre Trust, which was established under the Geelong Performing Arts Centre Trust Act 1980. The trust is comprised by persons nominated by the local councils; experienced in the fields of education, business administration, finance or the performing arts; or having an active interest and leadership role in the performing arts.

Plot Liffey and Richard, a young London couple who move to the country with the expectation of having children. Their neighbors are Mab and Tucker, a farming family with five children of their own. Mabs, jealous of the newcomers' easy life, sends Tucker to sleep with Liffey while Richard is away, priming her with an herbal aphrodisiac first. She becomes angry, however, when Liffey becomes pregnant and she finds that she herself is suddenly unable to conceive. Incorrectly believing the father of the child might be Tucker, Mabs attempts to abort the child by sneaking herbs into Liffey's tea and food. The unborn child, however, mystically takes charge and gives Liffey directions, saving her life and its own. Once the baby is born, Mabs sees the resemblance to Richard and, now pregnant herself, abandons her anger towards the couple. Reception Critic Mary Cantwell reviewed the novel in The New York Times Book Review, writing, \\"A Weldon novel is invariably a pleasure. Fay Weldon is also a very clever writer about women ...she speaks for the female experience without becoming doctrinaire and without the dogged humorlessness that has characterized so much feminist writing... She has not yet achieved the miracle of creating a character whose life goes on after the book has ended; since her women serve as vessels for her perceptions, they have no existence apart from their maker. Still, Fay Weldon enchants. If one wants more from her, it is because she is so obviously capable of doing more.\\" Film adaptation The novel was made into a film in 2007, directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring Donald Sutherland, Miranda Richardson and Rita Tushingham. The script was written by Weldon's son, Dan Weldon. Fay Weldon is said to have approved of the finished film upon seeing it.

Liquidating distributions are not paid solely out of the profits of the corporation. Instead, the entire amount of shareholders' equity is distributed. When a company has more liabilities than assets, equity is negative and no liquidating distribution is made at all. This is usually the case in bankruptcy liquidations. Creditors are always senior to shareholders in receiving the corporation's assets upon winding up. However, in case all debts to creditors have been fully satisfied, there is a surplus left to divide among equity-holders. This mainly occurs during voluntary liquidations of solvent corporations. Cases A dividend may be referred to as liquidating dividend when a company: # Goes out of business and the net assets of the company (after all liabilities have been paid) are distributed to shareholders, or # Sells a portion of its business for cash and the proceeds are distributed to shareholders. Liquidating distributions can be viewed as a form of return of capital, in that the capital invested in the corporation by its owners is returned to them, rather than only the earnings.

History Cross-section of the 3-inch quick-firing gun M1900 carriage. You can clearly identify the upper and the lower gun-carriage as well as the trail with the recoil-mechanism. The M1900 has been developed in 1900 by engineers of the Putilov Plants. Since 1898 the Imperial Russian Army was looking for a new field-gun and Krupp, Shamona and Schneider sent in their designs. The decision was made in favor for the M1900 and it became the first Russian gun with a recoil system and at the same time the first Russian 76.2-millimetre field gun. The guns were manufactured in the St. Petersburg Plants. Employment The M1900 saw the first action in the Russo-Japanese War and was superior to its Japanese counterpart, the Type 31 75 mm Field Gun and in particular, the Type 31 75 mm Mountain Gun, in regards of the rate of fire and range. The Japanese knew about this disadvantage and compensated this with numerical superiority. The gun saw further deployment during World War I. Though technically obsolete a number of M1900, however, appeared in the first part of the war to replace heavy losses the Russian Army suffered in the opening battles of 1914, but as soon as the successor of the M1900, the 76 mm divisional gun M1902, were available, they were withdrawn. In the Russian Civil War in 1917/18 the M1900 were used by both parties. Soon after the new Red Army sold or handed over some of the M1900 to some of the new Baltic States and such nations under Soviet influence such as Finland. Poland also received some of the guns and converted the original 76.2-mm (3-in) to 75-mm (2.95-in) caliber to match their existing artillery which consisted of French- made Canon de 75. In 1918 there was a total of 21 76 mm gun M1900-pieces in Finland. Specifications The gun has an upper and a lower gun-carriage. The upper gun-carriage slides, resting on grooves along the rail of the lower gun- carriage. In the trail is an oil buffer, acting as a recoil brake, which includes 40 india-rubber doughnuts which were compressed when the gun was fired. After the recoil stroke the doughnuts expanded again and the barrel returned into firing position. The barrel is reinforced with a thermal sleeve. The breech-block equipped with a so-called French turn breech-block with a turn bar, the first one on a Russian gun. The recoil system of the gun did not turn out to be sufficiently effective and that is why the number of manufactured guns remained low. * Calibre: 76.2 mm * Length of barrel: 31.4 cal * Weight of projectile: 6.4 kg * Muzzle velocity: 590 m/s * Maximum range: 6.7 km * Elevation: ‚àí6¬∞ to +11¬∞ * Traverse: ¬± 2.5¬∞ * Weight (in firing position): ca. 1,000 kg (2,200 lbs) Gallery File:76 K 00 H√§meenlinna 4.JPGA M1900 in the H√§meenlinna Artillery Museum, Finland.

Botanists and other biologists who study plant morphology use a number of different terms to classify and identify plant organs and parts that can be observed using no more than a handheld magnifying lens. This page provides help in understanding the numerous other pages describing plants by their various taxa. The accompanying page‚ÄîPlant morphology‚Äîprovides an overview of the science of the external form of plants. There is also an alphabetical list: Glossary of botanical terms. In contrast, this page deals with botanical terms in a systematic manner, with some illustrations, and organized by plant anatomy and function in plant physiology. This glossary primarily includes terms that deal with vascular plants (ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms), particularly flowering plants (angiosperms). Non-vascular plants (bryophytes), with their different evolutionary background, tend to have separate terminology. Although plant morphology (the external form) is integrated with plant anatomy (the internal form), the former became the basis of the taxonomic description of plants that exists today, due to the few tools required to observe. Many of these terms date back to the earliest herbalists and botanists, including Theophrastus. Thus, they usually have Greek or Latin roots. These terms have been modified and added to over the years, and different authorities may not always use them the same way. This page has two parts: The first deals with general plant terms, and the second with specific plant structures or parts.  General plant terms  * Abaxial ‚Äì located on the side facing away from the axis. * Adaxial ‚Äì located on the side facing towards the axis. * Dehiscent ‚Äì opening at maturity * Gall ‚Äì outgrowth on the surface caused by invasion by other lifeforms, such as parasites * Indehiscent ‚Äì not opening at maturity * Reticulate ‚Äì web-like or network-like * Striated ‚Äì marked by a series of lines, grooves, or ridges * Tesselate ‚Äì marked by a pattern of polygons, usually rectangles * Wing (plant) ‚Äì any flat surfaced structure emerging from the side or summit of an organ; seeds, stems.  Plant habit  Plant habit refers to the overall shape of a plant, and it describes a number of components such as stem length and development, branching pattern, and texture. While many plants fit neatly into some main categories, such as grasses, vines, shrubs, or trees, others can be more difficult to categorise. The habit of a plant provides important information about its ecology: that is, how it has adapted to its environment. Each habit indicates a different adaptive strategy. Habit is also associated with the development of the plant. As such, it may change as the plant grows and is more properly called its growth habit. In addition to shape, habit indicates plant structure; for instance, whether the plant is herbaceous or woody. Each plant commences its growth as a herbaceous plant. Plants that remain herbaceous are shorter and seasonal, dying back at the end of their growth season. Woody plants (such as trees, shrubs and woody vines (lianas) will gradually acquire woody (lignaceous) tissues, which provide strength and protection for the vascular system, and they tend to be tall and relatively long lived. The formation of woody tissue is an example of secondary growth, a change in existing tissues, in contrast to primary growth that creates new tissues, such as the elongating tip of a plant shoot. The process of wood formation (lignification) is commonest in the Spermatophytes (seed bearing plants) and has evolved independently a number of times. The roots may also lignify, aiding in the role of supporting and anchoring tall plants, and may be part of a descriptor of the plant's habit. Plant habit can also refer to whether the plant possesses any specialised systems for the storage of carbohydrates or water, allowing the plant to renew its growth after an unfavourable period. Where the amount of water stored is relatively high, the plant is referred to as a succulent. Such specialised plant parts may arise from the stems or roots. Examples include plants growing in unfavourable climates, very dry climates where storage is intermittent depending on climatic conditions, and those adapted to surviving fires and regrowing from the soil afterwards. Some types of plant habit include: * Herbaceous plants (also called Herbs): A plant whose structures above the surface of the soil, vegetative or reproductive, die back at the end of the annual growing season, and never become woody. While these structures are annual in nature, the plant itself may be annual, biannual, or perennial. Herbaceous plants that survive for more than one season possess underground storage organs, and thus are referred to as geophytes. Terms used in describing plant habit, include: An acaulescent species of Streptocarpus has only one leaf, and appears to have no stem * Acaulescent ‚Äì the leaves and inflorescence rise from the ground, and appear to have no stem. They are also known as rosette forms, some of the many conditions that result from very short internodes (i.e. close distances between nodes on the plant stem. See also radical, where leaves arise apparently without stems. * Acid plant ‚Äì plants with acid saps, normally due to the production of ammonium salts (malic and oxalic acid) * Actinomorphic ‚Äì parts of plants that are radially symmetrical in arrangement. * Arborescent ‚Äì growing into a tree-like habit, normally with a single woody stem. * Ascending ‚Äì growing uprightly, in an upward direction. * Assurgent ‚Äì growth ascending. * Branching ‚Äì dividing into multiple smaller segments. * Caducous ‚Äì falling away early. * Caulescent ‚Äì with a well-developed stem above ground. * Cespitose ‚Äì forming dense tufts, normally applied to small plants typically growing into mats, tufts, or clumps. * Creeping ‚Äì growing along the ground and producing roots at intervals along the surface. * Deciduous ‚Äì falling away after its function is completed. * Decumbent ‚Äì growth starts off prostrate and the ends turn upright. * Deflexed ‚Äì bending downward. * Determinate growth ‚Äì Growing for a limited time, floral formation and leaves (see also Indeterminate). * Dimorphic ‚Äì of two different forms. * Ecad ‚Äì a plant assumed to be adapted to a specific habitat. * Ecotone ‚Äì the boundary that separates two plant communities, generally of major rank ‚Äì trees in woods and grasses in savanna for example. * Ectogenesis ‚Äì variation in plants due to conditions outside of the plants. * Ectoparasite ‚Äì a parasitic plant that has most of its mass outside of the host, the body and reproductive organs of the plant live outside of the host. * Epigeal ‚Äì living on the surface of the ground. See also terms for seeds. ** Epigean ‚Äì occurring on the ground. ** Epigeic ‚Äì plants with stolons on the ground. ** Epigeous ‚Äì on the ground. Used for leaf fungus that live on the surface of the leaf. * Epilithic ‚Äì growing on the surface of rocks. * Epiphloedal ‚Äì growing on the bark of trees. ** Epiphloedic ‚Äì an organism that grows on the bark of trees. * Epiphyllous ‚Äì growing on the leaves. For example, Helwingia japonica has epiphyllous flowers (ones that form on the leaves). * Epiphyte ‚Äì growing on another organism but not parasitic. Not growing on the ground. ** Epiphytic ‚Äì having the nature of an epiphyte. * Equinoctial ‚Äì a plants that has flowers that open and close at definite times during the day. * Erect ‚Äì having an essentially upright vertical habit or position. * Escape ‚Äì a plant originally under cultivation that has become wild, a garden plant growing in natural areas. * Evergreen ‚Äì remaining green in the winter or during the normal dormancy period for other plants. * Eupotamous ‚Äì living in rivers and streams. * Euryhaline ‚Äì normally living in salt water but tolerant of variable salinity. * Eurythermous ‚Äì tolerant of a wide range of temperatures. * Exclusive species ‚Äì confined to specific location. * Exotic ‚Äì not native to the area or region. * Exsiccatus ‚Äì a dried plant, most often used for specimens in a herbarium. * Indeterminate growth ‚Äì Inflorescence and leaves growing for an indeterminate time, until stopped by other factors such as frost (see also Determinate). * Lax ‚Äì non upright, growth not strictly upright or hangs down from the point of origin. * Parasitic ‚Äì using another plant as a source of nourishment. * Precocious ‚Äì flowering before the leaves emerge. * Procumbent ‚Äì growing prostrate or trailing, but not rooting at the nodes. * Prostrate ‚Äì lying flat on the ground, stems or even flowers in some species. * Repent ‚Äì creeping. * Rosette ‚Äì cluster of leaves with very short internodes that are crowded together, normally on the surface of the soil but sometimes higher on the stem. ** ‚Äì like a rosette (cf. rostellum). ** Rosulate ‚Äì arranged into a rosette. * Runner ‚Äì an elongated, slender branch that roots at the nodes or tip. * Stolon ‚Äì A branch that forms near the base of the plant, grows horizontally, and roots and produces new plants at the nodes or apex. ** Stoloniferous ‚Äì plants producing stolons. * Semi-erect ‚Äì Not growing perfectly straight. * Suffrutescent ‚Äì somewhat shrubby, or shrubby at the base. * Upright ‚Äì Growing upward. * Virgate ‚Äì wand-like, slender erect growing stem with many leaves or very short branches. * Woody ‚Äì forming secondary growth laterally around the plant so as to form wood.

Plant structures = Introduction  Plant structures or organs fulfil specific functions, and those functions determine the structures that perform them. Among terrestrial (land) plants, the vascular and non-vascular plants (Bryophytes) evolved independently in terms of their adaptation to terrestrial life and are treated separately here (see Bryophytes). = Life cycle = Common structural elements are present in the embryonic part of the life cycle, which is the diploid multicellular phase. The embryo develops into the sporophyte, which at maturity produces haploid spores, which germinate to produce the gametophyte, the haploid multicellular phase. The haploid gametophyte then produces gametes, which may fuse to form a diploid zygote, and finally an embryo. This phenomenon of alternating diploid and haploid multicellular phases is common to the embryophytes (land plants) and is referred to as the alternation of generations. A major difference between vascular and non-vascular plants is that in the latter the haploid gametophyte is the more visible and longer- lived stage. In vascular plants, the diploid sporophyte has evolved as the dominant and visible phase of the life cycle. In seed plants and some other groups of vascular plants the gametophyte phases are strongly reduced in size and contained within the pollen and ovules. The female gametophyte is entirely contained within the sporophyte's tissues, while the male gametophyte in its pollen grain is released and transferred by wind or animal vectors to fertilize the ovules. = Morphology = Amongst the vascular plants, the structures and functions of the Pteridophyta (ferns), which reproduce seedlessly, are also sufficiently different to justify separate treatment, as here (see Pteridophytes). The remainder of the vascular plant sections address the higher plants (Spermatophytes or Seed Plants, i.e. Gymnosperms and Angiosperms or flowering plants). In the higher plants, the terrestrial sporophyte has evolved specialised parts. In essence, they have a lower, underground component and an upper, aerial component. The underground part develops roots that seek water and nourishment from the soil, while the upper component, or shoot, grows toward the light and develops a plant stem, leaves and specialised reproductive structures (sporangia). In angiosperms, the sporangia are located in the stamen anthers (microsporangia) and ovules (megasporangia). The specialised sporangia bearing stem is the flower. In angiosperms, if the female sporangium is fertilised, it becomes the fruit, a mechanism for dispersing the seeds produced from the embryo.  Vegetative structures  Thus, the terrestrial sporophyte has two growth centres, the stem growing upwards while the roots grow downwards. New growth occurs at the tips (apices) of both the shoot and roots, where the undifferentiated cells of the meristem divide. Branching occurs to form new apical meristems. Growth of the stem is indeterminate in pattern (not pre-determined to stop at a particular point). The functions of the stem are to raise and support the leaves and reproductive organs above the level of the soil, to facilitate absorption of light for photosynthesis, gas exchange, water exchange (transpiration), pollination, and seed dispersal. The stem also serves as a conduit, from roots to overhead structures, for water and other growth- enhancing substances. These conduits consist of specialised tissues known as vascular bundles, which give the name \\"vascular plants\\" to the angiosperms. The point of insertion, on the stem, of leaves or buds is a node, and the space between two successive nodes, an internode. The leaves, which emerge from the shoot, are specialised structures that carry out photosynthesis, and gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide) and water exchange. They are sheathed by an outer layer or epidermis that is coated with a waxy waterproof protective layer, which is punctuated by specialised pores, known as stomata, which regulate gas and water exchange. The leaves also possess vascular bundles, which are generally visible as veins, whose patterns are called venation. Leaves tend to have a shorter life span than the stems or branches that bear them, and when they fall, an area at the attachment zone, called the abscission zone leaves a scar on the stem. In the angle (adaxial) between the leaf and the stem, is the axil. Here can be found buds (axillary buds), which are miniature and often dormant branches with their own apical meristem. They are often covered by leaves.  Floral structure  The flower, which is one of the defining features of angiosperms, is essentially a stem whose leaf primordia become specialised, following which the apical meristem stops growing: a determinate growth pattern, in contrast to vegetative stems. The flower stem is known as a pedicel, and those flowers with such a stem are called pedicellate, while those without are called sessile. In the angiosperms, the flowers are arranged on a flower stem as an inflorescence. Just beneath (subtended) the flower there may be a modified, and usually reduced, leaf, called a bract. A secondary smaller bract is a bracteole (bractlet, prophyll, prophyllum), often on the side of the pedicel, and generally paired. A series of bracts subtending the calyx (see below) is an epicalyx. Angiosperms are dealt with in more detail here; these structures are very different in gymnosperms. In angiosperms, the specialised leaves that play a part in reproduction are arranged around the stem in an ordered fashion, from the base to the apex of the flower. The floral parts are arranged at the end of a stem without any internodes. The receptacle (also called the floral axis, or thalamus) is generally very small. Some flower parts are solitary, while others may form a tight spiral, or whorl, around the flower stem. First, at the base, are those non-reproductive structures involved in protecting the flower when it is still a bud, the sepals, then are those parts that play a role in attracting pollinators and are typically coloured, the petals, which together with the sepals make up the perianth (perigon, perigonium). If the perianth is differentiated, the outer whorl of sepals forms the calyx, and the inner whorl of petals, the corolla. If the perianth is not differentiated into sepals and petals, they are collectively known as tepals. In some flowers, a tube or cup-like hypanthium (floral tube) is formed above or around the ovary and bears the sepals, petals, and stamens. There may also be a nectary producing nectar. Nectaries may develop on or in the perianth, receptacle, androecium (stamens), or gynoecium. In some flowers nectar may be produced on nectariferous disks. Disks may arise from the receptable and are doughnut- or disk-shaped. They may also surround the stamens (extrastaminal), be at the stamen bases (staminal), or be inside the stamina (intrastaminal).  Reproductive structures  Finally, the actual reproductive parts form the innermost layers of the flower. These leaf primordia become specialised as sporophylls, leaves that form areas called sporangia, which produce spores, and cavitate internally. The sporangia on the sporophytes of pteridophytes are visible, but those of gymnosperms and angiosperms are not. In the angiosperms there are two types. Some form male organs (stamens), the male sporangia (microsporangia) producing microspores. Others form female organs (carpels), the female sporangia (megasporangia) producing a single large megaspore. These in turn produce the male gametophytes and female gametophytes These two components are the androecium and gynoecium, respectively. The Androecium (literally, men's house) is a collective term for the male organs (stamens or microsporophylls). While sometimes leaflike (laminar), more commonly they consist of a long thread-like column, the filament, surmounted by a pollen bearing anther. The anther usually consists of two fused thecae. A theca is two microspoorangia. The gynoecium (women's house) is the collective term for the female organs (carpels). A carpel is a modified megasporophyll consisting of two or more ovules, which develop conduplicatively (folded along the line). The carpels may be single, or collected together, to form an ovary, and contain the ovules. Another term, pistil, refers to the ovary as its expanded base, the style, a column arising from the ovary, and an expanded tip, the stigma. Within the stamen, the microsporangium forms grains of pollen, surrounded by a protective microspore, which form the male gametophyte. Within the carpel the megasporangium form the ovules, with its protective layers (integument) in the megaspore, and the female gametophyte. Unlike the male gametophyte, which is transported in the pollen, the female gametophyte remains within the ovule. Most flowers have both male and female organs, and hence are considered bisexual (perfect), which is thought to be the ancestral state. However, others have either one or the other and are therefore unisexual, or imperfect. In which case they may be either male (staminate) or female (pistillate). Plants may bear either all bisexual flowers (hermaphroditic), both male and female flowers (monoecious), or only one sex (dioecious), in which case separate plants are either male or female flower-bearing. Where both bisexual and unisexual flowers exist on the same plant, it is called polygamous. Polygamous plants may have bisexual and staminate flowers (andromonoecious), bisexual and pistillate flowers (gynomonoecious), or both (trimonoecious). Other combinations include the presence of bisexual flowers on some individual plants and staminate on others (androdioecious), or bisexual and pistillate (gynodioecious). Finally, trioecious plants have bisexual, staminate, or pistillate flowers on different individuals. Arrangements other than hermaphroditic help to ensure outcrossing.  Fertilisation and embryogenesis  The development of the embryo and gametophytes is called embryology. The study of pollens which persist in soil for many years is called palynology. Reproduction occurs when male and female gametophytes interact. This generally requires an external agent such as wind or insects to carry the pollen from the stamen to the vicinity of the ovule. This process is called pollination. In gymnosperms (literally naked seed) pollen comes into direct contact with the exposed ovule. In angiosperms the ovule is enclosed in the carpel, requiring a specialised structure, the stigma, to receive the pollen. On the surface of the stigma, the pollen germinates; that is, the male gametophyte penetrates the pollen wall into the stigma, and a pollen tube, an extension of the pollen grain, extends towards the carpel, carrying with it the sperm cells (male gametes) until they encounter the ovule, where they gain access through a pore in the ovule's integument (micropyle), allowing fertilisation to occur. Once the ovule has been fertilised, a new sporophyte, protected and nurtured by the female gametophyte, develops and becomes an embryo. When development stops, the embryo becomes dormant, as a seed. Within the embryo are the primordial shoot and root. In angiosperms, as the seed develops after fertilisation, so does the surrounding carpel, its walls thickening or hardening, developing colours or nutrients that attract animals or birds. This new entity with its dormant seeds is the fruit, whose functions are protecting the seed and dispersing it. In some cases, androecium and gynaecium may be fused. The resulting structure is a gynandrium (gynostegium, gynostemium, or column), which is supported by an androgynosphore.  Vegetative morphology  * Ptyxis ‚Äì the way in which an individual leaf is folded within an unopened bud. * Vernation ‚Äì the arrangement of leaves in an unopened bud. = Roots = Plants, with regard to identification and classification, are not often characterized by their roots, which are important in determining plant duration. However, in some groups, including the grasses, roots are important for proper identification. * Adventitious ‚Äì roots that form from other than the hypocotyl or from other roots. Roots forming on the stem are adventitious. * Aerial ‚Äì roots growing in the air. * (Root) crown ‚Äì the place where the roots and stem meet, which may or may not be clearly visible. * Fibrous ‚Äì describes roots that are thread-like and normally tough. * Fleshy ‚Äì describes roots that are relatively thick and soft, normally made up of storage tissue. Roots are typically long and thick but not thickly rounded in shape. * Haustorial ‚Äì specialized roots that invade other plants and absorb nutrients from those plants. * Lignotuber ‚Äì root tissue that allows plants to regenerate after fire or other damage. * Primary ‚Äì root that develop from the radicle of the embryo, and is normally the first root to emerge from the seed as it germinates. * Root Hairs ‚Äì very small roots, often one cell wide, that do most of the water and nutrient absorption. * Secondary ‚Äì roots forming off of the primary root; often called branch roots. * Taproot ‚Äì a primary root that more-or-less enlarges and grows downward into the soil. * Tuberous ‚Äì roots that are thick and soft with storage tissue, and are typically thick and round in shape.  Root structure terms  * Epiblema ‚Äì Outermost (epidermal) layer of rootlets. Normally 1-cell-layer thick (uniseriate). Normally do not have a cuticle, and permit water conduction. * Quiescent centre ‚Äì a small region inside the root's apical region that has a slower division rate. * Root Cap ‚Äì a cover or cap-like structure that protects the tip of root. ** Multiple root caps - several layers of root caps on a single root apex; seen in Pandanus sp. ** Root Pocket ‚Äì a cap-like structure on the root-apex of some aquatic plants, which, unlike root-caps, doesn't reappear if removed somehow. * Root hair ‚Äì fine cellular appendages from cells of epiblema. They are unicellular, which means one root hair and corresponding cell of epiblema comprise only 1 cell. By contrast, stem and leaf hairs can be unicellular or multicellular. Root hairs of older portions of roots are destroyed over time, and only at a certain region near a growing apex (called the root-hair-region) are root hairs seen. Although microscopic, root-hairs can be observed by the unaided eye in chili and Brassica seedlings.  Terms classifying roots and their modifications  * Tap-Root-System: ** Storage roots: *** Conical root ‚Äì Storage root that is broad at its base (upper portion) and gradually tapers to its apex (lower portion): e.g., Carrot. *** Fusiform root ‚Äì Storage root that is swollen in the centre and tapers towards both apex and base: e.g., radish (Raphanus sativus). *** Napiform root ‚Äì Root whose upper (basal) portion is heavily swollen but whose lower (apical) portion is narrow and tapering: e.g., beet, turnip. *** Tuberous or tubercular tap-root ‚Äì In its narrow sense, a tap-root that is thick and fleshy (due to storage) but that does not conform to the fusiform, conical, napiform shape: Mirabilis jalapa. In its broader sense, a tap-root that is thick and fleshy (due to storage); i.e. when tuberation take place in a tap-root. ** Pneumatophores (respiratory roots) ‚Äì Part of tap-root system as respiratory roots; found in many mangrove trees. They arise from the thick, mature branches of tap-root systems, and grow upwards. The inner tissue of respiratory roots is full of hollow, airy, tube- like dead cells, giving it a spongy texture. The outer surface of pneumatophores contains tiny pores or openings, which are called pneumathodes: e.g., Heritiera fomes, Rhizophora mucronata. Pneumatophores can be unbranched or sparingly branched. ** Vivipary ‚Äì This is a feature of many mangrove trees, where the seed germinates when the seed (and fruit) remain joined to the mother plant until the radicle and hypocotyl grow, reach the ground, and establish there.College Botany, VOL-1, By HC Gangulee, KS Das, CT Dutta, revised by S Sen, published by New Central Book Agency Kolkata (See also: seeds and germination related sections and articles) * Adventitious root systems ** Fibrous root ‚Äì Originate from the base of a young stem and replace the primary root (and also from the stem nodes, and sometimes internodes), and emanate as a parallel cluster or bunch from around the node. The adventitious roots of monocots are usually of this type. Replacement of a tap root system by a fibrous root is seen in onions, tuberose (Polyanthes tuberosa), grasses, etc. Fibrous roots from normal-stem nodes are seen in grasses like maize, sugarcane, bamboo, etc. Fibrous roots from nodes help in the survival of the plant and thus in vegetative reproduction, when the plant's base is damaged or cut inside the stem axis. ** Many dicots, too, release adventitious toots from stem-nodes, especially those that can regenerate vegetatively (Hibiscus rosa- sinensis, Coleus, etc.) and those that have a week stem with creeping habit (Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, etc.). These roots are called adventitious, not fibrous, roots. ** Adventitious storage roots ‚Äì similar function as storage-taproots. *** Tuberous roots or root tubers ‚Äì Narrow sense, those storage roots that do not conform to a specific shape, such as fasciculated, nodulose moniliform, annulated, etc.: e.g. sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), whose edible part is a root of this type. Broader sense, adventitious roots swollen due to their storage function. *** Fasciculated root ‚Äì When several tubercular roots grow as a parallel bunch or bundle. Seen in Dahlia sp., Ruellia tuberosa, Asparagus racemosus, etc. Orchis maculata have a pair of bulbous storage-roots. *** Nodulose root ‚Äì Not to be confused with root-nodules. Storage pattern is a root axis swollen near the apical portion, thus forming a bulbous or tuberous structure at or near the root tip. It is commonly seen associated with a rhizomatous stem. It is seen in Costus speciosus,A textbook of BOTANY, Vol-2, by Bhattacharya, Hait and Ghosh, NCBA Kolkata Curcuma amada,BOTANY For Degree Students, 6th edition, by AC Datta, Revised by TC Datta, Oxford University Press Curcuma domestica, Asparagus sprengeri, Arrowroot (Maranta), etc. and some species of Calathea. *** Moniliform or Beaded root ‚Äì When more than one swelling, or nodule-like, structures occur at intervals along the root axis. Such an alternating swollen-and-constricted pattern is seen in Cyperus sp., Dioscorea alata, Vitis trifolia, Portulaca sp., Basella sp., Momordica sp. and some grasses. *** Annulated root ‚Äì Like moniliform roots, annulated roots also contain alternating swollen and constricted regions; but here the length of constricted regions is so short that the root appears as a stack of discs. It is seen in Cephalis ipecacuanha (Rubiaceae). ** Floating or Aquatic- respiratory root ‚Äì The upright, spongy structures helps the plant to float. Seen in Jussiaea repens. ** Epiphytic root ‚Äì This type of root seen in epiphytic orchids. The thick root hangs from the plant's base directly into air. The root is covered with a special, usually 4- to 5-cell layer thick, spongy tissue (called Velamen), which helps the plant to absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Epiphytic orchid have another sort of root, called clinging roots, that help the orchid plant cling to the substratum (host). Since a similar function is seen in many other plants' adventitious roots, it is being mentioned in more general terms in the mechanical advancements section. ** Parasitic root or Haustoria ‚Äì ** Assimilatory or Photosynthetic roots ‚Äì ** Mechanical advancements ‚Äì *** Prop-roots ‚Äì In some dome-shaped (deliquescent) trees, from the mature horizontal boughs (stem-branches) some quite thick (millimeters to centimeters) roots come down. After growing and reaching the ground, they establish more elaborate root branches as well as show massive secondary thickening. Thus, they start to resemble the main trunk. Besides carrying the weight of horizontal boughs, when the main trunk is destroyed due to ageing or accident, the established prop-roots support the remaining plant- body, thus helping in vegetative reproduction. E.g. Ficus benghalensis. The Great Banyan Tree at IBG Kolkata is an example how prop-roots help in vegetative reproduction. *** Stilt roots ‚Äì From upright (erect) trunks, some hard, thick, almost straight roots come-out obliquely and penetrate the ground. Thus they act like a camera-tripod. They increase balance and support as well as, when these roots penetrates the ground, they increase soil grip. *** Root-Buttress or Plank Buttress or Buttress-Root ‚Äì *** Climbing roots ‚Äì *** Clinging roots ‚Äì *** Contractile-roots or Pull-roots ‚Äì *** Haptera ‚Äì root- like projections found in macroalgae or lichens that anchor the organism to a rocky substrate. ** Protective functions ‚Äì *** Root-thorns ‚Äì ** Reproductive roots ‚Äì These roots contain root-buds and actively take part in shoot- regeneration, and thus in vegetative reproduction. This is an unusual feature because roots normally do not contain buds. = Stems = Parts of plant stem Euonymus alata, an example of alate stems Saraca cauliflora, an example of cauliflora Sciadopitys verticillata, an example of a verticillate plant * Accessory buds ‚Äì an embryonic shoot occurring above or to the side of an axillary bud; also known as supernumerary bud. * Acrocarpous ‚Äì produced at the end of a branch. * Acutangular ‚Äì a stem that has several longitudinally running ridges with sharp edges. * Adventitious buds ‚Äì a bud that arises at points on the plant other than at the stem apex or leaf axil. * Alate ‚Äì having wing-like structures, usually on the seeds or stems, as in Euonymus alata. * Alternate ‚Äì buds are staggered on opposite sides of the branch. * Bark ‚Äì the outer layers of woody plants: cork, phloem, and vascular cambium. * Branches ‚Äì * Bud ‚Äì an immature stem tip, typically an embryonic shoot, either producing a stem, leaves, or flowers. * Bulb ‚Äì an underground stem normally with a short basal surface and with thick fleshy leaves. * Bundle scar ‚Äì a small mark on a leaf scar indicating a point where a vein from the leaf was once connected to the stem. * Caudex ‚Äì the hard base produced by herbaceous perennials, which serves in overwintering the plant. * Caulescent ‚Äì with a distinctive stem. * Cauliflora ‚Äì with the flowers and fruit on the stem, or trunk, as in Saraca cauliflora. * Cladode ‚Äì a flattened stem that performs the function of a leaf; an example is the pad of the opuntia cactus. * Cladophyll ‚Äì a flattened stem that is leaf-like and green ‚Äì used for photosynthesis.

The speciality products are edible oil, tea, kudzu tea and kudzu powder. History=Imperial The meaning of the town's name is the headstream (yuan) of kudzu (ge). As the Sui Dynasty ended and Tang Dynasty began, families with the surname of Su and Feng settled here at the source of a stream where kudzu flourished. In the year 3 of Tang Zhenguan (629 CE), a family surnamed Zheng moved here. Then came the families Cai, Ye, Luo and Jin. Revolutionary In December 1927, a rebellion against the Jiangxi governor was waged. In February 1931, the committee in charge of the Northeast Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area under Fang Zhimin moved from Yiyang county to Hengfeng, setting up the Soviet government of the Special Administration Region of northeast Jiangxi in Geyuan town. In November 1931, at Ruijin the Chinese Soviet Republic was declared a sovereign state; and Geyuan was named the capital of one of its constituent parts, i.e. the Northeastern Jiangxi Soviet. In December of the following year, the Soviet territory officially expanded into counties in Zhejiang and Fujian. In November 1934, Geyuan was occupied by Chinese government forces.

Editions Publimag Most of the area is taken up with chalets but are reserved for caravanning, and for camping. It also has two mobile home park sections. It has a covered indoor heated swimming pool, a new outdoor pool, an outdoor slide pool, a large conference hall, and boasts a Thalassotherapy centre. The center includes fitness classes, a weight room with machines and free weights, although they are about 30 yrs old. There are services like massage, mud baths, seaweed treatments and the other latest beauty treatments. Located near the camping section are basketball courts and tennis courts. There are 25 shops in the shopping centre. These include a bakery, wine shop, a grocery store, a fish market, and a general merchandise shop. Among its cultural offerings, Euronat has had a strong connection with Francois Malkovsky (1889-1982), a proponent of 'free dance'. Also in the center is a pizzeria, seafood restaurant, French restaurant and ice cream stand. A few bars complete the center. According to the center's bylaws, users must adopt total nudity in all parts of Euronat, including the shopping mall. The two supervised beaches are in total and have two helicopter pads, for air ambulance use.

It is the mathematical logic counterpart of the notion in category theory of (the codomain of) a forgetful functor, and in physics of (hypothesized) hidden variable theories purporting to explain quantum mechanics. Elementary classes are (vacuously) pseudoelementary but the converse is not always true; nevertheless pseudoelementary classes share some of the properties of elementary classes such as being closed under ultraproducts. Definition A pseudoelementary class is a reduct of an elementary class. That is, it is obtained by omitting some of the sorts and relations of a (many-sorted) elementary class. Examples *1. The theory with equality of sets under union and intersection, whose structures are of the form (W, ‚à™, ‚à©), can be understood naively as the pseudoelementary class formed from the two-sorted elementary class of structures of the form (A, W, ‚à™, ‚à©, ‚àà) where ‚àà ‚äÜ A√óW and ‚à™ and ‚à© are binary operations (qua ternary relations) on W. The theory of the latter class is axiomatized by :‚àÄX,Y‚ààW.‚àÄa‚ààA.[ a ‚àà X‚à™Y ‚áî a ‚àà X ‚à® a ‚àà Y] :‚àÄX,Y‚ààW.‚àÄa‚ààA.[ a ‚àà X‚à©Y ‚áî a ‚àà X ‚àß a ‚àà Y] :‚àÄX,Y‚ààW.[ (‚àÄa‚ààA.[a ‚àà X ‚áî a ‚àà Y]) ‚Üí X = Y] :In the intended interpretation A is a set of atoms a,b,..., W is a set of sets of atoms X,Y,... and ‚àà is the membership relation between atoms and sets. The consequences of these axioms include all the laws of distributive lattices. Since the latter laws make no mention of atoms they remain meaningful for the structures obtained from the models of the above theory by omitting the sort A of atoms and the membership relation ‚àà. All distributive lattices are representable as sets of sets under union and intersection, whence this pseudoelementary class is in fact an elementary class, namely the variety of distributive lattices. :In this example both classes (respectively before and after the omission) are finitely axiomatizable elementary classes. But whereas the standard approach to axiomatizing the latter class uses nine equations to axiomatize a distributive lattice, the former class only requires the three axioms above, making it faster to define the latter class as a reduct of the former than directly in the usual way. *2. The theory with equality of binary relations under union R‚à™S, intersection R‚à©S, complement R‚àí, relational composition R;S, and relational converse R\\\\breve{\\\\ }, whose structures are of the form (W, ‚à™, ‚à©, ‚àí, ;, \\\\breve{\\\\ }), can be understood as the pseudoelementary class formed from the three-sorted elementary class of structures of the form (A, P, W, ‚à™, ‚à©, ‚àí, ;, \\\\breve{\\\\ }, Œª, œÅ, œÄ, ‚àà). The intended interpretation of the three sorts are atoms, pairs of atoms, and sets of pairs of atoms, œÄ: A√ó;A ‚Üí P and Œª,œÅ: P ‚Üí A are the evident pairing constructors and destructors, and ‚àà ‚äÜ P√ó;W is the membership relation between pairs and relations (as sets of pairs). By analogy with Example 1, the purely relational connectives defined on W can be axiomatized naively in terms of atoms and pairs of atoms in the customary manner of introductory texts. The pure theory of binary relations can then be obtained as the theory of the pseudoelementary class of reducts of models of this elementary class obtained by omitting the atom and pair sorts and all relations involving the omitted sorts. :In this example both classes are elementary, but only the former class is finitely axiomatizable, though the latter class (the reduct) was shown by Tarski in 1955 to be nevertheless a variety, namely RRA, the representable relation algebras. *3. A primitive ring is a generalization of the notion of simple ring. It is definable in elementary (first-order) language in terms of the elements and ideals of a ring, giving rise to an elementary class of two- sorted structures comprising rings and ideals. The class of primitive rings is obtained from this elementary class by omitting the sorts and language associated with the ideals, and is hence a pseudoelementary class. :In this example it is an open question whether this pseudoelementary class is elementary. *4. The class of exponentially closed fields is a pseudoelementary class that is not elementary. Applications A quasivariety defined logically as the class of models of a universal Horn theory can equivalently be defined algebraically as a class of structures closed under isomorphisms, subalgebras, and reduced products. Since the notion of reduced product is more intricate than that of direct product, it is sometimes useful to blend the logical and algebraic characterizations in terms of pseudoelementary classes. One such blended definition characterizes a quasivariety as a pseudoelementary class closed under isomorphisms, subalgebras, and direct products (the pseudoelementary property allows \\"reduced\\" to be simplified to \\"direct\\"). A corollary of this characterization is that one can (nonconstructively) prove the existence of a universal Horn axiomatization of a class by first axiomatizing some expansion of the structure with auxiliary sorts and relations and then showing that the pseudoelementary class obtained by dropping the auxiliary constructs is closed under subalgebras and direct products. This technique works for Example 2 because subalgebras and direct products of algebras of binary relations are themselves algebras of binary relations, showing that the class RRA of representable relation algebras is a quasivariety (and a fortiori an elementary class). This short proof is an effective application of abstract nonsense; the stronger result by Tarski that RRA is in fact a variety required more honest toil. References * Paul C.

As a subsidiary of Dubai Inc., it is the emirate's flag bearer in global investments and has a central role in the direction of Dubai's economy. Assets include DP World, which caused considerable controversy when trying to take over six US ports, its property arm, Nakheel, which built The Palm Islands and The World developments, and Istithmar World, its investment company. It is chaired by Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum. History Dubai World was established under a decree ratified on 2 March 2006 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Ruler of Dubai. He is also the majority stakeholder in Dubai World. On 2 July 2006, it was launched as a holding company with more than 50,000 employees in over 100 cities around the globe. The group now has extensive real estate investments in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Dubai World made headlines in March 2008 after its chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, threatened to take the fund's money out of Europe. Dubai World's threats came shortly after the European Union attempted to lay out \\"a set of principles for transparency, predictability and accountability\\" for sovereign wealth funds. On 26 November 2009, Dubai World proposed to delay repayment of its debt, which raised the risk of the largest government default since the Argentine debt restructuring in 2001. Dubai World, the investment vehicle for the emirate, asked to delay for six months payment on $26 billion of debt. The extent of the debt rattled many markets causing many indices to drop; including oil prices. U.S. stocks fell sharply but rebounded from their lows as investors concluded that the damage might be contained. The Dow Jones industrial average lost about 155 points, or roughly 1.5 percent, in a shortened trading day, and other stock averages also sank. Oil prices plunged as much as 7 percent before recovering some ground later in the day. On 12 December 2010, Dubai named Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, head of Emirates airline and uncle of the state‚Äôs ruler, as chairman of Dubai World in a board revamp a year after the company said it would halt loan repayments, roiling markets. The 51-year-old replaced Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. Andrew (Andy) Watson, has been serving as the Managing Director at Dubai World since July 2011. On 29 January 2013, Drydocks World signed a memorandum of understanding for a US$2.5 billion joint venture partnership with Indonesia to develop a maritime cluster in the Asian country that would serve, among others, the petrochemicals industry. 2009 debt standstill With the onset of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, Dubai's real estate market declined after a six-year boom. On 25 November 2009, the Dubai government announced that the company \\"intends to ask all providers of financing to Dubai World to 'standstill' and extend maturities until at least 30 May 2010\\". The company has laid off 10,500 employees worldwide. At that time, Dubai World had debts of $59-billion, accounting for nearly three- quarters of the emirate's US$80-billion debt. This includes a US$3.5-billion loan which the company was unable to repay by its December deadline. In response to the government announced moratorium of Dubai World's debts, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's Investors Services heavily downgraded the debt of various Dubai government-related entities with interests in property, utilities, commercial operations and commodities trading. In Moody's case, the downgrade meant that the affected agencies lost their investment grade status. Concerns over the fallout from Dubai's debt problems contributed to the main European stock indexes falling over 3% on 26 November. This was followed by drops in Asian stocks on 27 November. However the European stock markets rebounded as investors' fears subsequently subsided as they decided the estimated debt wasn't big enough to trigger a systemic failure in global financial markets. \\"For now, the market is taking the view that the Dubai debt issue may be a storm rather than a hurricane,\\" said Jane Foley, a research director at Forex.com in London. The American markets were closed on 26 November but American stocks fell on the afternoon of 27 November as similar fears rattled Wall Street in a thinly-traded half-day session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) fell 155 points, or 1.5%, after closing 25 November at a 13-month high. The Dow had lost 233 points in the morning. Also, concerns of the crisis led to a sharp rally in the U.S. dollar and Japanese Yen against most other world currencies as these currencies had been perceived as \\"safe haven\\" currencies during times of uncertainty. An unnamed senior official told news agencies on 28 November that Abu Dhabi, the wealthy capital of the United Arab Emirates, would \\"pick and choose\\" how to assist Dubai World. \\"We will look at Dubai's commitments and approach them on a case-by-case basis,\\" the official told the Reuters news agency by telephone, adding: \\"It does not mean that Abu Dhabi will underwrite all of their debts.\\" Meanwhile, India's central bank governor said an assessment of the impact of Dubai's debt problems was needed before deciding on a response. \\"We should not react to instant news like this. One lesson of the crisis is that we must study the developments, and I think we must measure the extent of the problem there and how it impacts India,\\" Duvvuri Subbarao said in Hyderabad, India. A public statement on 30 November 2009, of the Dubai Finance Department Director-General, that the Dubai World debts are \\"not guaranteed by the government\\" appears to correctly reflect the legal position, as the Dubai Government were not required by the lenders, and nor did they provide, any contractual guarantees in respect of the Dubai World debt: Officials in the United Arab Emirates tried on 1 December to calm investors and the public over the Dubai World debt crisis, and the company itself said it was seeking to renegotiate only the $26 billion in obligations held by its troubled real estate developer, Nakheel. It also said that it had hired Moelis & Company, the investment boutique headed by Ken Moelis, a former UBS banker, to be its adviser. Rothschild is also advising Dubai World. Shares in Dubai and Abu Dhabi were down for a second day, with both key indexes declining about 6%. On 30 November, shares dropped in Dubai and Abu Dhabi by 7.3% and 8.3%, respectively. On 14 December 2009 the Dubai government received $10 billion in surprise aid from Abu Dhabi for debt-laden Dubai World, which said it would use $4.1 billion of it to repay its Nakheel unit's Islamic bond maturing on the same day. As of 24 January 2010 Dubai World's property assets have exceeded USD 120 billion, so that it could cover its debt of USD 57 billion. Debt deal Dubai World on 20 May 2010 said that it had reached an agreement \\"in principle\\" with most of its bank lenders to restructure debt worth $23.5bn (¬£16.4bn). It would be left with debts of $14.4bn after the restructuring. But the deal must still be approved by other banks that were not involved in the negotiations. The terms of the restructuring, include converting $8.9bn of government debt into equity. The government of Dubai and Dubai World had tabled this offer to bank lenders in March 2010 after three months of negotiations.

In one case in 1948, he represented a young civilian employee at Ladd Field named Joseph Vogler, who sought an injunction against University Bus Lines and its owners Paul and Flora Greimann. Vogler had a public, years-long feud with the Greimanns, centered on their company's practice of having their vehicles straddle the center line of the narrow Cushman Street Bridge. That bridge, constructed in 1917, was later replaced with a four-lane bridge. In other cases, he faced then-U.S. Attorney Ted Stevens, who later became another important Alaska politician. Stevens served as a Republican senator from Alaska from 1968 to 2009, making him the fourth most senior Senator and most senior Republican. In addition to his professional career, Taylor served multiple terms in Alaska Territorial House of Representatives (from 3rd District 1933‚Äì1934, 1945‚Äì1946 and from 4th District 1949‚Äì1950, 1955‚Äì1958). He served from each of the communities he lived in during his years in Alaska (Cordova, then Kodiak, then Fairbanks). He was a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention (1955‚Äì1956), serving as one of a handful of delegates elected from the territory at-large. After Alaska became the 49th State, Taylor was among the first members of the Alaska House of Representatives. He was selected by Democratic majority to serve as the first speaker of the Alaska House. He held this position from 1959 to 1962. Taylor ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Alaska in 1962, losing to incumbent and fellow constitutional convention delegate William A. Egan. This meant that he was not a candidate for reelection to his House seat. Nonetheless, he was reelected to the House in 1962, when one of the Fairbanks-area Democratic nominees elected in the primary election vacated his spot in favor of Taylor. Taylor retired from the House in 1966. He later moved into the Fairbanks Pioneer Home, where he died on August 5, 1980.

He was Chief of the General Staff at the time of the Haldane Reforms and then became Commander-in-Chief, Ireland. Army career Born the son of 4th Baron Lyttelton and Mary Lyttelton (n√©e Glynne) and educated at Eton College, Lyttelton was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade in January 1865. As a junior officer he was sent to Canada where he helped defeat the Fenian raids in 1866 and served as Secretary to the Oregon Boundary Commission in 1867. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 July 1869, to captain on 13 October 1877 and to major on 22 February 1882. In 1880 he was made Private secretary to Hugh Childers, Secretary of State for War. He took part in the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882 as an Aide-de-Camp to Sir John Adye, from 1 August 1882. He saw action at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir and was mentioned in despatches. He was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel and awarded the Order of Osmanieh (4th Class) on 17 November 1882. He became Assistant Military Secretary to Lieutenant General Sir John Adye in his role as Governor of Gibraltar on 1 January 1883 and Military Secretary to Lord Reay, Governor of Bombay in 1885. In his young life he made friends, mixing in whiggish aristocratic circles with Edward Grey and Arthur Balfour, later the shapers of imperial foreign policy.D.Owen, \\"The Military Perspective\\", p.35 He was promoted to brevet colonel on 18 November 1886 and became second-in-command of the 3rd Battalion of his Regiment in 1890. Promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 9 November 1892, he became Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion of his Regiment in 1893 and went on to be Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion of his Regiment in Ireland.

He was given command of 2nd Brigade with the temporary rank of brigadier general on 13 July 1898 and led his brigade at the battle of Omdurman in September 1898 during the Mahdist War. He returned to his role as Assistant Military Secretary at Headquarters on 21 October 1898 and then, having become a supernumerary major general for distinguished service in the field on 15 November 1898 and promoted to the substantive rank of major general on 10 February 1899, he briefly took back his old command at 2nd Brigade, now based at Aldershot Command, on 1 September 1899. Lyttelton served in the Second Boer War as Commander of the 4th Brigade in South Africa from 9 October 1899. He temporarily became General Officer Commanding the 2nd Division in February 1900, then commanded the 4th Division, and was involved in the Battle of Spion Kop in January 1900 and the Battle of Vaal Krantz in February 1900, leading to the Relief of Ladysmith later that month. Promoted to lieutenant general for distinguished service in the field on 22 March 1900, Lord Roberts in his despatch referred to Lyttelton as an officer \\"with great coolness under fire, and considerable tactical knowledge and resource...an excellent commander in the field.\\" He was in command of the troops in Natal until June 1902, when he became Commander-in-Chief of the whole of South Africa following the end of the Second Boer War the previous month. In this role Lyttelton and his wife sought to repair relations with the Boer community. In the South Africa honours list published on 26 June 1902, Lyttelton was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Lyttelton was present at the Siege of Ladysmith On 12 February 1904 he was appointed Chief of the General Staff and a member of the newly formed Army Council. This new post was created following the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces as recommended by Lord Esher in the Esher Report. Lyttelton was promoted to general on 9 April 1906. This was the time of the Haldane Reforms which sought to implement both a new expeditionary force and a new territorial force, but according to Edward M Spiers, Lyttelton was not up to the task ‚Äì he was \\"feckless, malleable, and failed to lead the Army Council\\". Lyttelton moved on to become Commander-in-Chief, Ireland on 10 May 1908. He took part both in the funeral procession following the death of King Edward VII in May 1910 and the coronation procession for King George V in June 1911. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 12 July 1911 and retired on 10 August 1912. In retirement he was a member of the Mesopotamia Commission which sat in 1916/17.

This motion picture stars Graham Greene, Floyd Red Crow Westerman, Ron Lea, and Michael Hogan, and directed by Polish filmmaker Ryszard Bugajski. Filmed in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and based on the novel A Dream Like Mine (1987) written by M. T. Kelly, it covers complex subject matter such as the land rights of indigenous peoples in Canada, pacifism, colonialism, and environmentalism. Notable actors include Graham Greene, and Phil Harris. Greene, known for his prolific work, including the critically acclaimed Dances with Wolves, is quoted as saying this is his favorite movie in which he has acted. Harris who is best known as the voice of Baloo in Disney's 1967 animated film The Jungle Book was cast in this movie as a policeman. Through making Clearcut, director Ryszard Bugajski stated that he set out to portray the issues that he saw existing with pacifism. By forcing the viewer to consider the arguments of the characters alongside their actions he hoped to show the viewer the complexity of these issues where good and evil is not so easily divided. Plot Arthur (Greene) rises up into the world from beneath the water, in a rural, forested area in Canada. A seaplane arrives, carrying a passenger to a First Nations reserve, where activists are engaged in a loud, chaotic conflict, attempting to block clearcutting on Indian land. The white man from the seaplane is a lawyer, Peter Maguire (Lea), who is representing the band whose land is designated for deforestation. Peter attempts to appeal the court decision which ruled in favor of the logging company, but to no avail. An elder member of the Nation, Wilf (Westerman) introduces the attorney to Arthur, who the attorney believes is a militant Indigenous activist. Arthur proceeds to kidnap the logging company's general manager, Bud (Hogan) and the four take off through the woods where Arthur claims he will \\"instruct\\" Peter and Bud in \\"listening to Mother Earth\\". As they travel deeper into the wilderness, Arthur says he will show them the damage caused to the land. Arthur's behaviour grows increasingly erratic and violent. Wilf's warnings and insinuations that Arthur may actually be Wisakedjak, an Indigenous trickster spirit (whom Wilf also refers to as \\"the Deceiver\\") begin to make more sense. Peter is faced with difficult decisions that test his loyalties and sense of reality. At the end Arthur, or whatever he is, returns to the water. Cast Reception = Release  Clearcut premiered at the Toronto International Film festival on September 10, 1991, and then had a limited DVD release. While the film never saw mainstream success in North America, it has developed a cult following in Germany. One possible reason that Clearcut failed to make a lasting impact was its proximity to the Oka Crisis. A widely covered land dispute between First Nations and the town of Oka, Quebec that resulted in violent clashes between Indigenous protesters and Quebec police. Clearcut's somewhat ambiguous and brutal portrayal of land claim disputes, along with its extreme violence targeted towards police and business owners could have contributed to its lack of success.  Influence  To this day, Clearcut remains an important part of the discussion surrounding the portrayal of indigenous peoples in contemporary film. Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film (2003) labels Clearcut a sympathetic portrayal of modern indigenous peoples, in which \\"native actors get to act out their colonially-induced angst\\". The Canadian Horror Film: Terror of the Soul (2015) comments on the character of Arthur being portrayed as a spiritual being, and how he is a symbolic representation of the response to colonial attitudes of racism and inequity.

It led to the 1994 Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi. Hutu Power political parties and movements included the Akazu, the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic and its Impuzamugambi paramilitary militia, and the governing National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development and its Interahamwe paramilitary militia. Ideology Hassan Ngeze in 1990 created the Hutu Ten Commandments that served as the basis of Hutu Power ideology.Ethnicity and sociopolitcal change in Africa and other developing countries: a constructive discourse in state building. Lexington Books, 2008. Pp. 92. The Commandments called for the supremacy of Hutus in Rwanda, calling for exclusive Hutu leadership over Rwanda's public institutions and public life, complete segregation of Hutus from Tutsis, and complete exclusion of Tutsis from public institutions and public life.John A. Berry and Carol Pott Berry (eds.) (1999). Genocide in Rwanda: A Collective Memory (Washington, D.C.: Howard University Press) pp. 113‚Äì115. Hutu Power ideology reviled Tutsis as outsiders bent on restoring a Tutsi-dominated monarchy, and idealized all things Hutu. The Commandments declared that any form of relationship between Hutus and Tutsi women was forbidden; and that any Hutu who \\"marries a Tutsi woman\\", \\"befriends a Tutsi woman\\", or \\"employs a Tutsi woman as a secretary or a concubine\\" was a traitor to the Hutu people. It denounced Tutsis as dishonest in business whose \\"only aim is the supremacy of his ethnic group\\"; and declared that any Hutu who did business with a Tutsi was a traitor to the Hutu people. The Commandments declared that \\"The Hutu should stop having mercy on the Tutsi\\" and referred to the Tutsis as \\"common Tutsi enemy\\". History=Background The Rwandan kingdom was traditionally ruled by a Tutsi mwami, or king; Historical evidence suggests that Hutu and Twa were included in government, although the Twa significantly less so than Hutu, who were more numerous. The Tutsi/Hutu divide has been referred to as a caste system. A Hutu could gain Tutsi status through marriage or through success. Tutsis, being primarily pastoralists, had a more valuable place in Rwandan society than the agriculturalist Hutu, and the hunter-gatherer and potter Twa. The society created conceptions of social status based on the groups' traditional pursuits: the Twa, working most directly with the earth (through pottery), were considered impure; the Hutu, still working with the ground but less so than the Twa, were in turn considered less pure than the above-ground Tutsi. When Germany, and later Belgium, colonized the kingdom, they interpreted the local division of races or ethnicity through the Hamitic hypothesis. European authors such as John Hanning Speke wrote of the Tutsi as being of Hamitic origin, having originated from modern-day Ethiopia and migrating southwards, and having brought \\"civilization\\" to the Negroid races of Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, the colonial administration favored the Tutsi at the expense of Hutu and Twa. In addition, they imposed a system of identity cards and ethnic classification in censuses, which reinforced an artificial ethnic division and contributed to tensions between groups. In reality, the Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa possessed little cultural or genetic distinction. Shift in Belgian colonial rule Toward the end of Belgian rule, the government began to favor the Hutu, who were organizing for more influence. More significantly, the Belgian administration feared the rise of Communism and a Pan-African socialist regime led by Congo-L√©opoldville's Patrice Lumumba. Then-Belgian High Resident Guy Logiest set up the first democratic elections in Rwanda to avoid more radical politics.\\"Belgian residents\\", Rwanda, World Statesmen, accessed 15 Sep 2010 As the majority population, the Hutu elected their candidates to most positions in the new government. Formation The first elected president Gr√©goire Kayibanda, an ethnic Hutu, used ethnic tensions to preserve his own power. Hutu radicals, working with his group (and later against it), adopted the Hamitic hypothesis, portraying the Tutsi as outsiders, invaders, and oppressors of Rwanda. Some Hutu radicals called for the Tutsi to be \\"sent back to Abyssinia\\", a reference to their supposed homeland. This early concept of Hutu Power idealized a \\"pre-invasion\\" Rwanda: an ethnically pure territory dominated by the Hutu. Under Habyarimana In 1973, general and defense minister Juv√©nal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu supported by more radical northern Rwandans, overthrew Kayibanda and had him and his wife killed. Many of his supporters were from his district in the north, descendants of Hutu kingdoms that had been semi-autonomous before the colonial period. The resulting administration proved better for Tutsis, as government-sponsored violence was more sporadic than under Kayibanda. With economic conditions difficult, and threatened by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invasion, Habyarimana turned to inflaming ethnic tensions. Spokespersons Hutu Power acquired a variety of spokesmen. Hassan Ngeze, an entrepreneur recruited by the government to combat the Tutsi publication Kanguka, created and edited Kangura, a radical Hutu Power newsletter. He published the \\"Hutu Ten Commandments\\", which included the following: *Hutu and Tutsi should not intermarry; *the education system must be composed of a Hutu majority (reflecting the population); and *the Rwandan armed forces should be exclusively Hutu. Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines broadcast radio shows suggesting the end to toleration of the Tutsi, repeating the Hutu Ten Commandments, and building support for the Hutu Power ideology. Two main voices of RTLM were announcers Val√©rie Bemeriki and Georges Ruggiu. The repetition of Hutu Ten Commandments was an attempt to incite and mobilize the population to commit genocide against the Tutsi, who were portrayed as threatening the social and political order achieved since independence, and as envisioned by the Akazu.Joan and Dixon Kamukama (2000). \\"Kakwenzire\\", in The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire, Howard Adelman and Astri Suhrke (eds).

Politician L√©on Mugesera gave a speech in November, 1992, allegedly stating, \\"Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck...Let them pack their bags, let them get going, so that no one will return here to talk and no one will bring scraps claiming to be flags!\\"Supreme Court of Canada - Decisions - Mugesera v.

London: Transaction Publishers. Page 146 Following Habyarimana's assassination, an act that at the time people speculated was done by Tutsi extremists, Hutu Power forces mobilized militia, most notably Interahamwe, and mobs to carry out the mass killings of the Rwandan genocide. The Presidential Guard of the army killed Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana and several other leading moderate government officials. Aftermath The defeat of the government by the RPF ended the genocide, and the Hutu Power movement was defeated and suppressed. Many Hutu Power spokesmen were arrested after the genocide, charged and put on trial. Ngeze was convicted and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment.

Both as a virtuoso and as composer of flute music, he is considered one of the best of his time. He was considered to be a tough leader and teacher and demanded as such a lot from his orchestras but through that style he reached a high level. Biography As well as his little brother, Viggo was taught by his father and already as a child he performed with success at a Danish theater called Casino accompanied by the little harpist Frantz P√∏nitz. From when he was 13 years old to the year of 1868 he was first flutist in a musical orchestra in Copenhagen conducted by Niels Gade. In 1869 he became employed by the Royal Danish Orchestra as a flutist but resigned after a year of leave in 1878. He was longing for larger challenges and went abroad. First stop was Saint Petersburg (1878‚Äì1880) where he was engaged by St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Afterwards in 1881 he went to Berlin where he was engaged in Bilse's Band as a solo flutist as well as he was in the Royal German Opera. In 1882 he was a co-founder of the Berlin Philharmonic, which he and 53 other musicians formed out of the former Bilse's Band. Along with his job as a solo flutist, he took over more and more conductor's assignments and conducted over 8 summers one of the orchestra's two daily concerts in Scheveningen. In 1893 Andersen was forced to resign his job because of a paralysis in his tongue and travelled then back to Copenhagen where he was employed as a composer. Among other pieces he was the composer of concerts in Tivoli Gardens. In 1897 he founded an orchestra school and was, until his death, leader and professor in conducting at the school. In 1905 he was knighted by king \\"Christian IX of Denmark\\" to the \\"Order of the Dannebrog \\". Works His compositions are almost exclusively for the flute. His 8 volumes of etudes for flutists of the highest level are considered his largest success. They are still used all over the world when one wants to be a top professional. His complete works consist of 63 opuses which are mainly for the flute including solo pieces and piano accompanied pieces.

Staunton Harold Hall - Shirley's birthplace Tamworth castle Robert Shirley was the eldest son of Hon. Robert Shirley (1673‚Äì1699) and his wife Anne Ferrers (d. 1698), and was born at Staunton Harold Hall. He inherited Tamworth Castle and other estates in Staffordshire upon his mother's death, and became heir apparent to his grandfather, Lord Ferrers of Chartley, when his father died the following year. He was styled Viscount Tamworth after 1711, when his grandfather was created Earl Ferrers. When Sir Geoffrey Palmer, Member of Parliament for Leicestershire was forced by straitened finances to step down at the 1713 election, Tamworth was put forth by the Tories to replace him. At the time, the Tories held both Leicestershire seats; thorough canvassing on the part of Tamworth and some judicious payments quieted the Whig opposition, and Tamworth and the sitting member, Sir Thomas Cave, were returned without a poll. In the new Parliament, he was teller in favour of a supply bill on 22 June to grant Queen Anne 32 years of additional duties on various goods. Two weeks later, he was, like his father, stricken by smallpox and died on 5 July. He was buried at Staunton Harold. He left his estates, including Tamworth Castle, to his sister Elizabeth, who later married James Compton, 5th Earl of Northampton, and his personal property to his aunt, Lady Barbara Shirley (d. 1768).

It was one of the most successful with many sales and chart-hits in Russia. Bi-2 was awarded MTV Russian Music Awards for Best Rock Act in 2007. History=Pre-history The band was formed in 1985 in Minsk, Belarus by two teenagers, Aleksandr \\"Shura\\" Uman and Egor \\"Lyova\\" Bortnik, who were amateur actors. Initially, the band's name was \\"Bratya po Oruzhiyu\\" (Brothers in Arms), which was formed in 1988, then \\"Bereg Istini\\" (Shore of Truth), which resulted in abbreviation BI-2. This word Lyova and Shura begun to use as their scenic names, and Shura eventually changed his passport surname to Bi-II. In the beginning of the 90s the two moved to Israel and as Jews received citizenship, but in 1993 Shura moved to Australia while Lyova remained and served in the Israel Defense Forces. In 1994 Shura formed a romantic and professional relationship with pianist and artist Victoria Bilogan and in 1997 they recorded their first album \\"Bespolaya i Grustnaya Lubov\\". During this time, Lyova and Shura continued to compose music together, exchanging their records and tabs via Internet and phone. Before forming Chiron, Shura collaborated with Dee Ellus, his first English lyricist, in 1993 and 1994. Shura, together with Dino Molinaro and Michael Aliani, former members of Ikon, formed the darkwave band Chiron. In 1998 Leva moved to Australia and joined Chiron as well, but the two left the project in less than two years to continue with their own band. Modern history In 1999 Bi-2 moved to Russia, where they previously tried to release their already recorded album \\"Bespolaya i Grustnaya Lubov\\" (Genderless and Sad Love, 1998), but their plans were ruined by the Russian financial crisis of 1998, which affected the record business. In 1999, the band consisted only of two men, but the lineup soon was increased by sessional musicians. The band went up to popularity only in 2000, recording the score for popular Brother 2 movie by Aleksei Balabanov. Several score songs, included in the Bi-2 eponymous debut album, shook rock radio charts, including the influential Nashe Radio chart. Bi-2 continued with \\"Meow Kiss Me\\" (2001) and \\"Inomarki\\" (2004), both sold gold in Russia. Each of their albums included duet records with other rock musicians from such bands as Splean, Chaif, Nochniye Snaiperi, Zemfira, and others. Videos for Bi-2 songs often appear on MTV Russia. In 2005 the double CD \\"Nechetny Voin\\" was released, which consists completely of duets and collaborations.

The band was formed in 1978 in Leningrad by Sergey Omelnichenko, Evgeny Voloschuk, Aleksey Dobychin and Edmund Shklyarskiy. Piknik is considered to be one of the \\"classic\\" Russian rock bands. Originated from the classic rock with huge influence of Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin, its music progressed into its own style with using symphonic and exotic folk instruments. Also Piknik is considered sometimes to be the first Russian gothic rock band due to its specific sound, stage performances and dark lyrics. During more than 30 years of its existence the group's lineup changed many times, and the one and only permanent member and leader of the group is the frontman and lyricist Edmund Shklyarskiy. The name of the group was created as an allusion to the well- known novel Roadside Picnic written in 1971 by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Some of their early songs are written in Polish language. In 2016 the band made it to the list of artists barred from performing in Ukraine, due to them performing in Crimea as part of Russia, which is seen as occupied territory by Ukraine.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to cylindrical fruit. Description Corymbia aparrerinja is a tree that typically grows to a height of , often much less, and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, sometimes powdery, white to cream-coloured and pinkish bark that is shed in thin patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped leaves that are long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch with groups of three or seven buds, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs in summer and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to more or less cylindrical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed. Taxonomy and naming Corymbia aparrerinja was first formally described in 1995 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson from specimens collected on Gosses Bluff by Herbert Basedow in 1925. The same specimens were used by William Blakely to describe (in English), Eucalyptus papuana F.Muell. var. aparrerinja, but did not provide a Latin diagnosis (\\"description\\"), so the name was not validly published. Distribution and habitat Ghost gum occurs in arid areas of Central Australia on rocky slopes, red sand flats and dry creek beds. It is found from near Giles in Western Australia, through the south of the Northern Territory as far north as Tennant Creek to near Mount Isa and Barcaldine in Queensland. Uses Parts of this tree were used by Indigenous Australians to treat colds. Culture In 1891 in Barcaldine, a ghost gum known as the Tree of Knowledge, was the focal point of a gathering of striking sheep shearers, a key event leading to the formation of the Australian Labor Party. This species of tree features in aboriginal Dreamtime stories and gained prominence with the wider public in the 20th century through the paintings of aboriginal artist Albert Namatjira.

For the film, see Resurrection (1960 film). Voskreseniye () is a Russian rock band. History The band was formed in 1979, when drummer Sergey Kavagoe decided to leave Mashina Vremeni and form his own group. Kavagoe was joined by Mashina Vremeni's bassist, Evgeny Margulis. Alexey Romanov became the group's leader and songwriter, and Alexey Makarevich joined as guitarist. During this period the band released the successful albums Voskreseniye 1 () and Voskreseniye 2 (). In 1980, Margulis left the group, after being invited to join the group Araks, and Konstantin Nikolsky, Andrey Sapunov, and Mikhail Shevyakov joined the line-up. In August 1982, Romanov and the group's sound engineer, Alexander Arutyunov, were arrested and charged with private entrepreneurial activity. The band went on a hiatus from 1982 to 1994, and former members played in several other groups. Romanov, Sapunov, Nikolsky, and Shevyakov reunited in 1989 to play at the Druzhba arena in a concert celebrating the group's tenth anniversary. The group officially reformed in 1994, performing on March 12 with a line-up of Romanov, Sapunov, Nikolsky, and Shevyakov, with Nikolsky serving as the group's leader. Nikolsky left the group shortly afterwards, due to creative differences, and Romanov asked Margulis to rejoin. Voskreseniye performed its first concert with this new line-up in St. Petersburg on May 1, sharing the bill with Cruise. In 2001, they released a new album, called Vse Snachala (), which contained re-recordings of old songs. In 2003, the band released a new album with new songs called Ne Toropyas ().

Epiphanius additionally held the offices of lector, subdeacon and deacon. During his lifetime, Epiphanius undertook several church-related missions and exploits. Two of the most significant of these were his journey, as an emissary for the emperor Julius Nepos, to the Visigothic king Euric; and his journey to Ravenna, where he confronted Theodoric the Great shortly after his defeat of Odoacer, and pleaded for the restoration of the civic rights of Roman aristocrats who had supported Odoacer. Biography Our primary source for Epiphanius' life is the Vita Epifanius written by Magnus Felix Ennodius, who knew him personally, travelling with the bishop on his mission to king Gundobad of the Burgundians in 494-6. According to Ennodius, Epiphanius' father was Maurus and his mother Focaria, who was related to Mirocles bishop of Milan (304-326).Vita Epifanius, 7; translated by Genevieve Marie Cook, The Life of Saint Epiphanius by Ennodius: A translation with an introduction and commentary (Washington: Catholic University of America, 1942), p. 35 He joined the household of bishop Crispinus at the age of eight and became a lector, learning to read and write, as well as stenography. At the age of 18 he was consecrated subdeacon,Vita Epifanius, 18; translated by Cook, p. 39 and deacon at 20.Vita Epifanius, 26; translated by Cook, p. 43 Then Bishop Crispinus, as he lay dying, appointed Epiphanius as his successor in the presence of the ex-consul Flavius Rusticus. Although he resisted the ordination, Epiphanius was made bishop in Milan in his 28th year.Vita Epifanius, 36-42; translated by Cook, pp. 47f Shortly after becoming bishop, Epiphanius was asked to intervene between Anthemius and the barbarian leader Ricimer, appealing to both parties for peace.Vita Epifanius, 51-71; translated by Cook, pp. 53-71 However, history shows that Epiphanius' efforts were in vain, for violence broke out between Ricimer and Anthemius; Anthemius was besieged in the part of Rome he controlled until his supporters deserted him, and he was caught attempting to flee the city disguised as a supplicant at the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where he was beheaded.John of Antioch, fragment 209, translated by C.D Gordon, The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 122f Most of these confrontations and speakings to high- ranking figures proved to be successful endeavors; religious dignitaries such as Epiphanius had wide-ranging influence on the rulers and aristocrats during this period. In the eighth year of his episcopate (spring 475),Following the chronology Cook worked out in her edition of Vita Epifanius, at p. 9 n. 6 the emperor Julius Nepos sent him on a diplomatic mission to Euric about Visigothic incursions. A peace was concluded, although Nepos was deposed by Orestes shortly after.Vita Epifanius, 81-100; translated by Cook, pp. 65-73 Cook notes that of \\"the thirteen years of Odoacer's matery in Italy, from the defeat of Orestes in A.D. 476 to the coming of Thodoric, A.D. 489 -- a period which embraced nearly half of the episcopate of Epiphanius -- Ennodius devotes but eight sections of the vita (101 - 107), five of which are taken up with the account of the restoration of churches.\\"Cook, The Life of Saint Epiphanius by Ennodius, p. 12 The only other incident Ennodius recorded during these 13 years was his successful petition to Odoacer to alleviate the rapacious demands of the praetorian prefect Pelagius.Vita Epifanius, 106-108; translated by Cook, pp. 75-77 Another success was Epiphanius' successful negotiations over the ransom of his sister Honorata,Epiphanius's sisters Honorata and Liberata are both venerated as saints. who had been abducted from the monastery of St. Vincent in Pavia, during the war between Theodoric the Great and Odoacer. After Theodoric had prevailed, one of his acts was to punish the Romans who had supported Odoacer by depriving them of their civic rights; Epiphanius went to the Ostragothic king and pleaded for their restoration. Theodoric granted the bishop's petition, on condition that Epiphanius act on his behalf and negotiate with the Burgundians to ransom the captives they took when they raided Liguria during the war between Theodoric and Odoacer in 489.Wolfram, History of the Goths, translated by Thomas J. Dunlap (Berkeley: University of California, 1988), p. 281 Epiphanius died following the rigors of his winter journey to Burgundy, on 21 January 496, in his fifty-eighth year.August Neander, 'Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche): '\\"Epiphanius of Pavia\\" That particular year marked thirty years of his service to the church. Veneration Following Epiphanius' death, Ennodius, his successor as bishop of Pavia, wrote a Vita or \\"Life\\" of Epiphanius; based on internal evidence dates its composition between 501 and 504.Cook, The Life of Saint Epiphanius by Ennodius, p. 6 Epiphanius' relics were translated to Hildesheim in 963,Bernhard Gallistl, Epiphanius von Pavia, Schutzheiliger des Bistums Hildesheim, Hildesheim 2000 where they are conserved in a grand reliquary chasse in the Dom.√ñkumenisches Heiligenlexikon Despite the extensive evidence for the removal of his remains, there was in Pavia a persistent belief in possessing Epiphanius' remains. So strong was this belief that in the 18th century they reinterred what they considered the bishop's corpse in the church of San Francesco da Paola; later these relics were translated to the church of San Francesco Grande. In 1834, Bishop Tosi of Pavia formally recognized the authenticity of these remains.Cook, Life of Saint Epiphanius, p. 243  References  Category:Medieval Italian saints Category:Bishops of Pavia Category:5th-century bishops Category:438 births Category:496 deaths Category:Burials at Hildesheim Cathedral Category:5th- century Christian saints ","title":"Epiphanius of Pavia"},{"id":"12748332","text":"Arena Point (previously known as Tower North Central and Tower House) is a 77m high office tower in Leeds, England.

The band's unusual instrumentation - including a Hammond organ, accordions, and a harmonica - gave them a unique sound. The San Diego music scene is well known for producing Christian rock bands such as Switchfoot and P.O.D., and despite its brief national life Dryve produced what the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music calls \\"stellar examples of Christian rock at its best.\\" History The band was formed in 1993 when two folk duos merged to create one group. The first consisted of Paul Donovan (guitar, vocals) and Cory Verner, (guitar, vocals) childhood friends who had played together since about 1990, and the second of Keith Andrew (drums) and Steve Pratschner (guitar). With the addition of David (keyboard, sax, organ) and Michael Pratschner (upright and regular bass guitar), both brothers of Steve Pratschner, the band's lineup was complete. By the fall of that year that had recorded their first demo, dubbed South. In November 1994 they released their independently produced debut, Hum. The release lead to some local recognition: The first track, \\"Happy Song\\", won the 1994 San Diego Songwriter's Guild contest, and the album was nominated in the \\"Best Rock Album\\" category at the 1995 San Diego Music Awards. Dryve became well known locally, and between 1995 and 1996 Dryve played 90 shows in the San Diego area. During this time they opened for acts such as Possum Dixon, Sonia Dada, and Jeff Buckley. Their break came in 1996 after opening for Black Eyed Sceva, later known as Model Engine, at a local show. They signed with SaraBellum Records and soon began touring the country. Their first national tour was in the fall of 1996 with labelmates Black Eyed Sceva and the Dime Store Prophets. February 1997 saw the release of what was to be the band's only nationally distributed album, Thrifty Mr Kickstar. In support they toured with Sixpence None the Richer and Model Engine. In June of that year Dryve was featured at the Cornerstone Christian music festival. Thrifty was critically acclaimed, and took the title of \\"Best Adult Alternative Album\\" at the 1997 San Diego Music Awards. Their song \\"Nervous\\" received some radio airplay alternative rock stations and charted on Contemporary Christian music stations, peaking at No. 22. The band's final tour began in October 1997 with The Call. Dryve broke up in 1998. Style Dryve brought a unique sound to the San Diego music scene and beyond. For instance, few bands use a Hammond organ, but even fewer bands tour with one. They also mixed two male vocalists, harmonica, and accordion into their songs. The resulting sound was so unusual that Cross Rhythms commented that \\"the only band that sound like Dryve is Dryve!\\" Other reviewers classified their sound as melodic rock similar to Tom Petty, R.E.M., or the Wallflowers. Their most popular song was called \\"Rain\\". It has been played by worship groups in churches throughout the country. Part of its appeal was the lengthy, dreamy, yet powerful guitar solo by Steve Pratschner. As described by The Lighthouse: \\"It starts off slow and worshipful... Then it grows and grows to a full extended instrumental jam of praise.\\" Other standout songs included \\"Nervous\\": a \\"near perfect hit single\\", and \\"Television\\": an angst-tinged hard rock tune. Lyrically Thrifty included songs touching topics such as sin, pride, hope, and despair, while managing \\"to avoid the sometimes confusing lingo of the evangelical Christian subculture\\".

In 1932, the Landi Kotal to Landi Khana section of railway was closed down at the insistence of Afghan government. Regularly scheduled rail service continued between Peshawar and Landi Kotal until 1982, when it stopped due to lack of commercial value.

The train consisted of a refurbished parlour car and two second class coaches pulled by two vintage steam locomotives, as those used originally on the Khyber Pass Railway. The train was run on the first Sunday of every month as a charter, however the local population around the Khyber Pass were allowed free access. Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation took over operations in 2006 and in the same year the service was suspended due to monsoon damage of the line.

Plot summary It tells the story of Tashi, an African woman and a minor character in Walker's earlier novel The Color Purple. Now in the US she comes from Olinka, Alice Walker's fictional African nation where female genital mutilation is practiced. Tashi marries an American man named Adam then leaves Olinka because of the war. Tashi chooses to go back to Olinka to undergo circumcison because she is a woman torn between two cultures, Olinkan and Western. Instead of feeling free from not having the procedure done as a child, she feels bothered by it. She wants to honor her Olinkan roots and has the operation in her teen years, although it is usually performed on female children. Tashi later sees several psychiatrists because she goes crazy due to the trauma she has suffered before finding the strength to act. The novel is told in many different voices, which are the characters in the novel. The novel explores what it means to have one's gender culturally defined and emphasizes that, according to Walker, \\"Torture is not culture.\\" Characters Tashi \\"Evelyn\\" Johnson- The main protagonist of the novel. She is haunted by her experiences as a child and on the run from her memories, especially the act of female circumcision that she underwent as a young adult rather than a young child like other children following the tradition of her village. The novel delves into her struggles recuperating emotionally and physically from the circumcision as she is enveloped in revelations about the underlying meaning of her culture. Once she has the procedure done things go downhill pretty quickly and Tashi goes mad. Adam Johnson- The son of Celie from The Color Purple, he is Tashi's lovingly supportive husband. Adam watches Tashi's downward spiral into darkness with the miserable frustration of being incapable of helping her. His intensely powerful insecurity and fear causes him to indulge in a merely comforting affair with his longtime friend, the French feminist, Lissete. As a result of their extramarital union, their son, Pierre is born. Adam is heartbroken as his affair pushes Tashi further away, and must face the consequences of his actions. Benny Johnson- Tashi and Adam's adult son; Benny has an intellectual disability as a result of his brain being damaged during his birth, which was complicated because of Tashi's infibulation. Benny's limited abilities make Tashi increasingly depressed because she blames her circumcised vulva for Benny's agonizing journey from her womb. Benny is very curious about the world and is willing to study about it in order to keep up conversations with his parents. Lisette- Adam's lover and mother of Pierre, Adam's second son. Dura- Tashi's older sister that bled to death in childhood due to the ritual circumcision. Tashi comes to view Dura's death as a murder, and repeatedly emphasizes that Dura has been \\"screaming in her ears\\" since her death. M'Lissa- Tsunga of the tribe into which M'Lissa was born. The tsunga performs circumcisions (e.g. excision and infibulation) on the girls of the tribe. M'Lissa performed the circumcision on Dura that caused her to bleed to death. Carl Gustav Jung- Jung appears as the therapist of Tashi, the novel's protagonist. He is usually called \\"Mzee\\" but is identified by Alice Walker in the afterword.

Over a 32-year period, it was broadcast through three different networks: ABS-CBN (1958 to 1965), GMA Network (1975 to 1986) and Radio Philippines Network (1989 to 1990). History=DZXL Student Canteen was originally a radio show on DZXL hosted by Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, Bobby de Veyra and Leila Benitez entitled CBN Canteen.http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20080831-157838/Everybody- Loves-Leila The noontime show was aired on the canteen of the old Manila Chronicle Building in Aduana, Manila. It was later renamed Student Canteen after it became a hit with students. Chronicle Broadcasting Network (1958‚Äì1965) In July 1958, DZXL Channel 9, then owned by the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (a precursor of ABS-CBN) started broadcast operations. Student Canteen was brought to television that same year. The noontime show ended in 1965 when Eddie Ilarde went into politics. Prior to that however, the set of hosts for the show were replaced after main hosts Bobby Ledesma and Leila Benitez walked out of the program along with Eddie following a dispute. Pete Roa, then production manager of ABS-CBN, handpicked his wife Boots Anson- Roa, Ben Aniceto, Pepe Pimentel and Nelda Navarro as replacements. Noontime show successors Magandang Tanghali, a musical variety show hosted by Pancho Magalona, and Stop Look and Listen, a former noontime variety show hosted by Eddie Mesa, took over the Student Canteen timeslot in 1965. After Mesa left for the United States, Twelve O'Clock High, a show hosted by Ariel Ureta and Tina Revilla, premiered and aired until 1972 when martial law was declared. The show moved to RBS (now GMA Network) as Ariel con Tina, through a blocktimer company headed by Romy Jalosjos from 1972 to 1974. Lunch Break also gained ground on the same channel before Student Canteen was eventually revived. GMA Network (1975‚Äì1986) In 1975, the triumvirate of Menardo Jimenez, Felipe Gozon and Gilberto Duavit Sr. took over Republic Broadcasting System (RBS) and changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts. Looking for a show that can serve as a gateway to daytime dominance, the new management conducted negotiations with Eddie Ilarde who readily agreed to revive Student Canteen under his production company Program Philippines Inc. In January 1975, Student Canteen was revived, with Helen Vela and Coney Reyes joining original hosts Pepe Pimentel, Bobby Ledesma and Eddie Ilarde. Ramon Ramano was the original director of the show. Ariston \\"Aris\\" Bautista was the floor director, and later the show's director. The show had a segment called \\"Search for the Student Canteener\\" which was a singing contest. This segment attracted a lot of high quality contestants and many of former \\"Canteeners\\", including Marco Sison, became successful professional singers. Many other singing contest segments within the show produced some of the country's top singers. Bert Nievera, for example, was the champion of the segment called, \\"Search for Johnny Mathis of the Philippines.\\" The program also featured a highly popular segment called \\"IQ 7\\" which was actually a quiz contest and which produced the country's top quiz champions like Bong Barrameda, Ramon Lorenzo, Romeo Miat, Victor Saymo, Vic Volfango, Antonio Manaloto, Esmeraldo Tellerva, Gil Manimbo, Eduardo Alvaran, Virgilio Acasio, Nazzir Abbas, Roberto Villareal, Emilio Apostol, Nehemias Miguel, Nilo Francisco, Sonny Pascual, Leoncio Pelayo, David Oriel, Leon Bongulto, Pete Dadula, Boni Magtibay, and many others who have gone on to excel in their respective chosen fields of endeavor. A spin-off of the quiz segment \\"IQ 7\\" called \\"Battle of Campus Brains\\" produced the first and only female quiz champion in the history of GMA-7 quiz shows, Essem Zisenia Solomon, who defeated the then reigning champion Pete Dadula and several other quiz veterans. Student Canteen was the only noontime show that existed in the 1970s before the debut of Eat Bulaga! on July 30, 1979, hosted by the trio of Tito, Vic & Joey, formerly from Student Canteen. Eat Bulaga! was in danger of cancellation until the segment \\"Mr. Macho\\" made it the top- rating noontime show in 1980. Afterwards, Student Canteen's ratings began to decline. Coney Reyes would leave the show after it took in Chiqui Hollman, formerly from Eat Bulaga!. Other fresh faces would later join Student Canteen, including Jackie Lou Blanco, Chat Silayan, Dyords Javier and Francis Magalona. Julie Vega was supposed to be included in the show however, the plan was shelved following her illness and subsequent death in 1985. The show's stint on GMA ended on June 7, 1986 following the People Power Revolution. It was later replaced by Lunch Date. Radio Philippines Network (1989‚Äì1990) Student Canteen went back on air on February 20, 1989 with a new home, RPN (renamed as New Vision 9) replacing \\"Eat Bulaga!\\" which moved to ABS-CBN. The show was also retitled Student Canteen (The Third Generation) because it was the show's third revival and third decade on Philippine Television. Original hosts Eddie Ilarde and Bobby Ledesma were joined by Malu Maglutac, Jean Garcia, Cherry Pie Picache and Atoy Co as co-hosts. Ramon Lorenzo served as the Quiz Master for the \\"IQ 7\\" segment. It was also during the RPN-9 era when the show was beamed for the first time nationwide via satellite, as the network's DOMSAT facilities were still active despite the sequestration. The show ended in 1990 due to disagreements between the RPN management and the hosts. A revival was in the works again the following year, but it was shelved after main host Bobby Ledesma died in 1993. Alas Dose sa Trese On July 24, 1999, former Student Canteen main host Eddie Ilarde resurfaced in the noontime scene as host of the IBC noontime show Alas Dose sa Trese. He was joined by the mother-daughter tandem of Boots Anson-Roa (a former host of the original Student Canteen), Chiqui Roa-Puno (newscaster of PTV and one of the top female sportscasters at that time), Ernani \\"Jong\\" Cuenco, Pia Pilapil and actor-musician Paco Arespacochaga in the show. Some elements of Student Canteen were seen in the show, along with former contestants from \\"Student Canteen\\"'s singing portions who gamely sang and entertained audiences via the segment \\"Student Canteen Corner\\". The show ended on November 3, 2000.

The essays were written between 1978 and 1983, four of them in response to requests and the rest unprompted. Two of the essays were first published in two German publications, and two were originally presented by Cutler at two international symposia on popular music. The book was first published in 1985 in London by November Books, the publishing wing of Cutler's independent record label, Recommended Records. It was also published in Polish, German and Japanese. Rock critic and sociologist Simon Frith described File Under Popular as \\"A stirringly aggressive antidote to contemporary pop cynicism.\\" Essays #\\"What is Popular Music?\\" #\\"The Realm of Lightning / Black Music in a White World / Sun Ra, a Life Work\\" #\\"Living in the Electric: The Residents\\" #\\"Phil Ochs and Elvis Presley\\" #\\"Necessity and Choice in Musical Forms: Concerning Musical and Technical Means and Political Needs\\" #\\"Progressive Rock in the UK: What Was Unique to the Development of Rock and Electric Music in the UK?\\" #\\"Progressive Music, Progressive Politics?\\" Essay notes *\\"What is Popular Music?\\" was a paper written and presented by Cutler at an International Association for the Study of Popular Music (IASPM) conference in 1983. *\\"Living in the Electric: The Residents\\" was written in 1980 for a German publication Rocksession; a postscript was written for this collection in 1983. *\\"Phil Ochs and Elvis Presley\\" was written in 1978 in response to Ochs's suicide in 1976, his public obsession with Presley and the connection between the two. *Parts I and III of \\"Necessity and Choice in Musical Forms\\" were derived from an address given by Cutler at the Popular Music Research Symposium at Exeter in September 1982, and at the Festival des Politischen Liedes in East Berlin in February 1982 respectively; Part II is a free- standing bridge linking Parts I and III, written for this collection in 1983. *\\"Progressive Rock in the UK\\" was written for publication in the former German Democratic Republic; a postscript was written for this collection in 1983. Synopsis The essays in File Under Popular tackle the subject of \\"popular music\\", what it is, its origins and the political and marketing forces behind it. Cutler charts the history of music and how it was changed by written notation and then recording technology. Three of the essays dwell specifically on individual musicians and groups, namely Sun Ra, The Residents, Phil Ochs and Elvis Presley, but their stories are told within the context of the evolution of music. \\"Necessity and Choice in Musical Forms\\" is the first sketch of an analytical theory that shows how memory systems underpin the forms that music can take; part III of this essay is a personnel memoir of Cutler's that explains how his former band, Henry Cow functioned outside the music industry and their involvement in the establishment of Rock in Opposition. The last two essays deal with the development of progressive rock in the United Kingdom, its significance and the politics behind it. Cutler continued his analysis on \\"popular music\\" in 1986 in two articles, \\"Skill, Part 1: The Negative Case For Some New Music Technology\\" and \\"Skill, Part 2: Heavy Metal, Punk and the New Wave\\", published in the RƒìR Quarterly sound- magazine, Volume 1 Number 3 (1986) and Volume 2 Number 2 (1987), respectively. These articles were later reworked by Cutler into a single essay entitled \\"Skill\\", which was included in the 1996 expanded Japanese edition of File Under Popular. Background File Under Popular was originally intended for publication in 1984 in what was then Czechoslovakia at the instigation of Josef Vlcek of the Prague-based non-profit arts organisation, Jazzov√° Sekce- Artforum. As the majority of these essays had not been published in English, Cutler decided to publish an English edition in London. The Czech edition was supposed to be published first, but it was delayed and the English edition appeared in 1985. Further delays and problems eventually resulted in the Czech edition being abandoned. File Under Popular was later also published in Polish, German and Japanese. Cutler placed the following dedicatory in File Under Popular: \\"Since Jazzov√° & Josef remain the sine qua non of its publication, it must be to them & to their work, that this book is respectfully dedicated.\\" Editions *United Kingdom **First edition, November Books, 1985 **Second edition, November Books, 1989 **Revised second edition, November Books, 1992 *United States **Revised second edition, Autonomedia, 1992 *Germany, published as Texte zur popul√§ren Musik, translated by Kersten Glandien **First edition, Michael Schwinn, 1985 **Revised second edition, Michael Schwinn, 1994 *Poland, published as O Muzyce Popularnej, translated by Ireneusz Socha **First edition, Zielona Sowa, 1985 **Revised and expanded second edition, Zielona Sowa, 1999 *Japan, published as „Éï„Ç°„Ç§„É´„Éª„Ç¢„É≥„ÉÄ„Éº„Éª„Éù„Éî„É•„É©„Éº‚Äï„Éù„Éî„É•„É©„ÉºÈü≥Ê•Ω„ÇíÂ∑°„ÇãÊñáÂåñÁ†îÁ©∂ **First edition, Suisei Sha, 1985 **Revised and expanded second edition, Suisei Sha, 1996 Edition notes *The expanded second edition published in Poland contains an extra essay, \\"Plunderphonia\\". *The expanded second edition published in Japan contains two extra essays, \\"Plunderphonia\\" and \\"Skill\\". *\\"Plunderphonia\\" was first published in MusicWorks 60 in 1994. *\\"Skill\\" was derived from two articles, \\"Skill, Part 1: The Negative Case For Some New Music Technology\\" and \\"Skill, Part 2: Heavy Metal, Punk and the New Wave\\", published in the RƒìR Quarterly sound-magazine, Volume 1 Number 3 (1986) and Volume 2 Number 2 (1987), respectively.

According to the Nirukta (ii.10), the Brihaddevata, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas, he was a Kuru prince and the eldest son of King Pratipa of Hastinapura. He was a noble and well-liked prince but he was not allowed to succeed Pratipa, because he was affected with leprosy and the council of Brahmins and elderly citizens were opposed to this proposal. As a result of this, his younger brother Shantanu succeeded Pratipa as the king of Hastinapura.Misra, V.S. (2007). Ancient Indian Dynasties, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.83-4 Later Devapi retired to the forest for penance. According to the Matsya Purana and the Bhagavata Purana, he along with the sage Maru will remain alive till the end of the present Kali Yuga at a place called Kalapagrama and will revive the Paurava dynasty in the next Satya Yuga.Pargiter, F.E. (1972). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. pp.165, 165ff Drought in Kuru realm According to the Brihaddevata of Shaunaka, when Devapi abdicated the throne in favour of Shantanu and left for the forest, the realm of Kuru suffered from severe drought for twelve years, as Parjanya did not rain. Finally, Shantanu along with his subjects went to the forest and offered him the Kuru throne, which he declined. Instead, he agreed to become Shantanu's purohita (priest) and conduct a yajna (sacrifice) for him to produce rain.Brihaddevata, vii,155-7, viii.1-9 A later version of this narrative is found in the Vishnu Purana (IV.20) According to the Vishnu Purana, the reason of drought, as explained to Shantanu by his brahmin ministers, was the displeasure of the gods because of Shantanu's ascending the throne in place of his elder brother, a violation of the law of primogeniture. When a wily minister of Shantanu heard this, he dispatched a number of heretics to the forest, who perverted the simple-minded prince Devapi in anti-Vedic doctrines. When the Brahmins sent by Shantanu came to the forest to offer him the throne, he advanced arguments contrary to the precepts of the Vedas. As a result, Brahmins declared him degraded and unfit to rule, whereupon there was rain.Thapar, Romila (1978, reprint 1996). Ancient Indian Social History Some Interpretations, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , pp.271-2 In Vedic literature In Vedic literature, Devapi is always mentioned as DevƒÅpi Ar·π£·π≠i·π£e·πáa, though the later texts, the Mahabharata and the Puranas mention DevƒÅpi and Ar·π£·π≠i·π£e·πáa as different persons.Pargiter, F.E. (1972). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. p.165ff The earliest reference is found in the Rigveda (X.98). Modern scholars are not unanimous about the true meaning of Ar·π£·π≠i·π£e·πáa. F. E. Pargiter (1852-1927) argues that it means Devapi was son of king ·πö·π£·π≠i·π£e·πáa, and so both Shantanu and Devapi were actually grandsons of Pratipa, but other modern scholars, which include S.N.

The smaller Asian man puts an open palm in the air to acknowledge the taller man. A steel-helmeted policeman is in the foreground and others in white caps are in the background. The Double Seven Day Scuffle was a physical altercation on July 7, 1963, in Saigon, South Vietnam. The secret police of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu--the brother of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám--attacked a group of US journalists who were covering protests held by Buddhists on the ninth anniversary of Di·ªám's rise to power. Peter Arnett of the Associated Press (AP) was punched on the nose, and the quarrel quickly ended after David Halberstam of The New York Times, being much taller than Nhu's men, counterattacked and caused the secret police to retreat. Arnett and his colleague, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and photographer Malcolm Browne, were later accosted by policemen at their office and taken away for questioning on suspicion of attacking policemen. After their release, the journalists went to the US embassy in Saigon to complain about their treatment at the hands of Di·ªám's officials and asked for US government protection. Their appeals were dismissed, as was a direct appeal to the White House. Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped. Vietnamese Buddhists reacted to the incident by contending that Di·ªám's men were planning to assassinate monks, while Madame Nhu repeated earlier claims that the US government had been trying to overthrow her brother-in-law. Browne took photographs of Arnett's bloodied face, which were published in newspapers worldwide. This drew further negative attention to the behaviour of the Di·ªám r√©gime amidst the backdrop of the Buddhist crisis. Background alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. The incident occurred during a period of popular unrest by the Buddhist majority against the Roman Catholic rule of Di·ªám. Buddhist discontent had grown since the Hu·∫ø Ph·∫≠t ƒê·∫£n shootings on May 8, 1963.Jones, p. 247. The government decided to selectively invoke a law, prohibiting the display of religious flags, by banning the use of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. One week earlier, the Vatican flag had been flown at a celebration for Archbishop Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, Di·ªám's brother. The Buddhists defied the ban, flying their flags on Vesak and holding a demonstration, which was ended with government gunfire and eight or nine deaths.Jacobs, pp. 141-143. The killings sparked nationwide protests by South Vietnam's Buddhist majority against the policies of Di·ªám's regime. The Buddhists demanded that Di·ªám give them religious equality, but with their demands unfulfilled, the protests increased in magnitude.Jones, pp. 248-262. The most notable of these was the self-immolation of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c on June 11, which was iconically photographed by the media and became a negative symbol of the Di·ªám r√©gime. Known as Double Seven Day, July 7 was the ninth anniversary of Di·ªám's 1954 ascension to Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam. In October 1955, following a fraudulent referendum, Di·ªám established the Republic of Vietnam, generally known as South Vietnam, and declared himself President.Jacobs, p. 95. The night of July 6, 1963, had started in a festive mood as Di·ªám awarded decorations to military officers at a ceremony. Among those in the audience were Generals Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n and D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, the Chief of Staff of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the Presidential Military Advisor, respectively.Hammer, p. 147. They had returned from observing SEATO military exercises in Thailand,Jones, p. 286. where they had been informed about the regional disquiet over Diem's policies towards the Buddhists. Incident American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu,Langguth, p. 219. thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera.Prochnau, p. 328. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public.Hammer, p. 157.Jones, p. 285. Halberstam's report estimated that the altercation lasted for around ten minutes and also admitted that the pressmen had tried to apprehend the policeman who had smashed Browne's camera but were shielded by the rock-wielding policeman's colleagues. He also claimed that the secret policemen had also tried to seize equipment from Masraf and Faas. alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. Diem's address on Double Seven Day worsened the mood of Vietnamese society. He stated that the \\"problems raised by the General Association of Buddhists have just been settled.\\" He reinforced perceptions that he was out of touch by attributing any lingering problems to the \\"underground intervention of international red agents and Communist fellow travelers who in collusion with fascist ideologues disguised as democrats were surreptitiously seeking to revive and rekindle disunity at home while arousing public opinions against us abroad\\". The remark about fascists was seen as a reference to the conspiratorial Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang who had long been enemies of Diem, but his address attacked all those who had criticised him in the past. He no longer trusted anyone outside his family and considered himself to be a martyr.Hammer, pp. 157-158. Reaction The indignant reporters stridently accused the Diem regime of causing the altercation, whereas the police claimed that the journalists threw the first punch. Embassy official John Mecklin noted that even Diem's media officials were privately skeptical about the veracity of the testimony of Nhu's men. In a heated meeting at the embassy, the press corps demanded that William Trueheart, the acting US Ambassador to South Vietnam in the absence of the vacationing Frederick Nolting, deliver a formal protest to Diem on behalf of the American government. Trueheart angered them by refusing to do so and blaming both sides for the confrontation. He said that he did not believe a formal protest was possible given that it could not be proven that the violence was pre-meditated but claimed to believe the journalists' version of events. He also noted that Vietnamese officials had claimed that incident was simply a matter of \\"a few people lost their heads\\". In his report to Washington, Trueheart asserted that the uniformed policemen had tacitly helped their plainclothed counterparts, but he also had \\"no doubt that [the] reporters, at least once [the] fracas had started, acted in [a] belligerent manner towards [the] police\\". Trueheart contended that since the journalists had a long history of bad blood with the Diem regime, their word could not be taken over that of the Vietnamese police. Later on the same day, the US State Department released a statement in Washington DC, announcing that the Saigon Embassy had informally complained to and asked Diem's regime for an explanation regarding the incident, and said that officials were studying various accounts of the incident and that it was American policy to look out for the interests of their citizens regardless of their background or occupation. Since the embassy was unwilling to provide government protection against police aggression, the journalists appealed directly to the White House. Browne, Halberstam, Sheehan and Kalischer wrote a letter to US President John F. Kennedy, asserting that the regime had begun a full-scale campaign of \\"open physical intimidation to prevent the covering of news which we feel Americans have a right to know\\", which was noted by the press secretary Pierre Salinger. The protests did not garner any Presidential sympathy for the journalists, but instead resulted in trouble from their media employers. UPI's Tokyo office criticised Sheehan for trying to \\"make Unipress policy\\" on his own when \\"Unipress must be neutral, neither pro-Diem, pro- Communist or pro-anybody else\\". Emanuel Freedman, the foreign editor of The New York Times reprimanded Halberstam, writing \\"We still feel that our correspondents should not be firing off cables to the President of the United States without authorization.\\" The incident provoked reactions from both the Buddhists and the Diem regime. A monk called on the US embassy to send a military unit from the American advisors already present in Vietnam to X√° L·ª£i Pagoda, the main Buddhist temple in Saigon and the organisational hub of the Buddhist movement. The monk claimed that the attack on Arnett indicated that X√° L·ª£i's monks were targets of assassination by Nhu's men, something that Trueheart rejected, turning down the protection request. X√° L·ª£i and other Buddhist centers across the country were raided a month later by Special Forces under the direct control of the Ngo family. On the part of the South Vietnamese government, the de facto first lady Madame Nhu used her English- language mouthpiece newspaper, the Times of Vietnam, to accuse the United States of supporting the failed coup attempt against Diem in 1960. Arrest and interrogation Later on during the day of the altercation, the police collected Browne and Arnett from the AP bureau in Saigon and took the pair to what they described as a \\"safe house\\". The police interrogators said that they would be arrested but were unspecific about the charges. One charge was that of assaulting two police officers, but the interrogators hinted that more serious offences such as organising illegal demonstrations were being considered. The officers conversed among themselves in French, a language which the reporters did not speak, but Arnett thought that they mentioned the word espionage. After four hours of questioning, the pair were charged with assault. Browne and Arnett in turn filed charges against the police over the altercation, and demanded compensation for the damage to their photographic equipment. Arnett and Browne were temporarily released in the evening, after which the whole Saigon press corps stormed the US embassy.Prochnau, p. 329. Browne and Arnett were called in for five hours of questioning on the following day. Arnett was accompanied by a British embassy official who, reflecting Arnett's New Zealand citizenship, provided consular assistance on behalf of Wellington.Prochnau, p. 330. In the end, Diem agreed to have the charges against Browne and Arnett dropped after hours of heated argument with US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, who had returned from his vacation.

These were originally used in brewing.  Plumbing  The term is still used today in plumbing, where a funnel or hopper is filled by an outlet pipe above it. This is often provided for intermittent overflows, or where an air gap is required, to avoid possible back-contamination.  Casting  In metal casting, a tundish is a broad, open container with one or more holes in the bottom. It is used to feed molten metal into an ingot mould so as to avoid splashing and give a smoother flow. The tundish allows a reservoir of metal to feed the casting machine while ladles are switched, thus acting as a buffer of hot metal, as well as smoothing out flow, regulating metal feed to the moulds and cleaning the metal. Metallic remains left inside a tundish are known as tundish skulls and need to be removed, typically by mechanical means (scraping, cutting). A casting tundish is lined with refractory bricks specific to the liquid metal which is being cast.

The ships were taken over by the Soviet Navy during World War II and used as transport vessels. The class was named after Joseph Stalin. The two Soviet ships Iosif Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov (after Vyacheslav Molotov) were constructed in 1939 by the Dutch company N.V. Nederlandsche Dok & Scheepsbouw Maatschappij (NDSM), in Amsterdam. The ships were intended for the Soviet Far East waters, but due to the outbreak of World War II, they were taken over by the BGMP. The ships were ready and left Amsterdam on 1 May 1940, only nine days prior the German occupation of the Netherlands. Ships of the class Iosif Stalin 1941.

The Iosif Stalin was heavily damaged and eventually scuttled in early December when she participated in the Soviet evacuation of the Hanko Peninsula. On 3 December 1941 she departed Hanko with 5,589 men. However she ran into three naval mines, despite being escorted by several minesweepers and being equipped with paravanes. The ship's stern was severely damaged, and her propulsion system was lost, and there were many casualties. While the crew tried to repair the ship, Finnish coastal artillery spotted the convoy and opened fire. Soon the Iosif Stalin took a hit aft from a 12\\" (305 mm) shell. The shell hit an ammunition magazine, causing a large explosion and the ship began to sink. The dense minefield made it extremely dangerous to try to save the ship. Several Soviet minesweepers were damaged, and one exploded during the rescue operation. Minesweepers No. 205, 211, 215, and 217, and a further 5 patrol boats from the convoy defense managed to rescue 1,740 men. Panic struck the remaining passengers. The convoy continued its journey, and the Iosif Stalin, which had settled deep in the water (water reaching the main deck) drifted towards the Estonian shore and ran aground. A planned Soviet rescue attempt was aborted because one minesweeper ran into a mine and exploded. German forces captured the survivors of the Iosif Stalin. The ship was \\"forgotten\\" in Soviet history, since its commander ordered a capitulation of the nearly 3,000 strong survivors, although they had weapons and ammunition to put up a fairly good defense.

She was damaged by a mine (which sunk the minesweeper T-201 Zaryad) and aerial bombing and was towed back to Leningrad to be repaired. The ship was later used as a stationary hospital ship during the blockade of Leningrad. It also found other uses: its radio station transmitted news and it also functioned as an ammunition factory. The Vyacheslav Molotov was damaged by German artillery fire in early 1943. The Vyacheslav Molotov was repaired and returned as a passenger ship after the second world war. She was later used for the Leningrad-London route and also for trips to many European countries, Cuba and the United States. In 1957 she was renamed Baltika. She was also used to transport many international delegations, including those for the 20th Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. In September 1971, as Baltika, she repatriated many of the 105 Soviet officials, including 45 diplomats, expelled from the United Kingdom for \\"activities incompatible with their status\\". She was refitted in 1984 in Denmark, but broken up in 1987.

Location Pulingome is a village located in Cherupuzha Panchayath, in the Kannur district Northern Kerala. Located between the Western Ghats and the Karnataka forest, It is 76 kilometers away from Kannur and 36 km from Payyanur. History The name Pulingome is believed to be originated from a huge tamarind tree (Puli) located at the riverside on the way to nearby village Palavayal. Pulingome was under the rule of Mushika dynasty of Ezhimala during the Sangha Age. Later, this became part of \\"Kolathunadu\\" under Chirakkal dynasty. Pulingome had a well established society and a rich culture all through its history. The ancient Sree Sankaranarayan temple here is believed to be set up by \\"Parasuram\\". The Pulingome Makham were two holy men of Islam, were buried some 1300 years ago and the remaining of a temple in the Karnataka forest near the border are examples of Pulingome‚Äôs cultural heritage. Later with the invasion of Tippu these regions were brought under Mysore kingdom and after Tippu‚Äôs death the region was under British rule.

There is a yearly celebration called Pulingome Makham Uroos which will be participated by large number of people coming from different parts of Kerala and Karnataka. A peculiarity of the Mosque is that the landlord Kamballur Kottayil family (a Hindu Nambiar clan) is consulted even today before scheduling the Urs festivities. This is a testament to the age-old bond between the Mappilas of the area and the feudal Hindu families of the region. * Kottathalachi Mount The famous Kottathalachi Mount is in this village.

Early life Martin was born at Highside House, near Hexham in Northumberland, one of the twelve children of William Fenwick Martin and Isabella, n√©e Thompson. Among his siblings was the artist John Martin and the philosopher William Martin. Jonathan was tongue tied and spoke with an impediment. He was brought up by his aunt, Ann Thompson, a staunch Protestant with a vivid image of hell. After he witnessed the murder of his sister by a neighbour, he was sent to his uncle's farm to recover from the shock. He was apprenticed to a tanner but was press ganged in London in 1804. He served in the Royal Navy ship HMS Hercule for six years, including the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. He was noted among his shipmates for his religious obsession. He left the Navy when his ship was broken up in 1810, returning to Norton, County Durham, where he married, and his son Richard was born in 1814. After his parents died, he became a Wesleyan preacher in 1814, strongly denouncing the Church of England. He gained a reputation for disrupting church services. After threatening to shoot the Bishop of Oxford, Edward Legge at a confirmation service in Stockton in 1817, he was arrested, tried, and was sent to a private lunatic asylum in West Auckland. He was later moved to the public asylum in Gateshead. He escaped in June 1820, but was soon recaptured. His wife died of breast cancer in 1821, and he escaped from the asylum for a second time, returning to work as a tanner and preacher. The Wesleyan Church refused to take him back, and he was turned away by the Primitive Methodists. He published his autobiography at Lincoln in 1826, with further editions published in 1828, 1829 and 1830, and he made a living by selling his book. Arson He remarried in Boston, Lincolnshire in 1828, to Maria Hudson, and the couple moved to York. Etching of York Minster by William Martin, Jonathan's brother A year later, Martin had another mental breakdown. On Sunday 1 February 1829, he became upset by a buzzing sound in the organ while attending evensong at York Minster. He hid in the building, and then lit a lamp in the belltower. The cathedral watchman had been discharged, and the light was ignored by anyone who saw it. Later that night, he set fire to the woodwork in the choir before escaping through a window. Smoke was seen coming out of the building at 7am on 2 February, and the fire was raging through the organ and choir by 8am. The fire was brought under control that afternoon and extinguished on 3 February, when the extent of the damage became apparent. A section of the roof of the central aisle approximately long was destroyed, stretching from the lantern tower towards the east window, together with much of the internal woodwork from the organ screen to the altar screen, including the organ, medieval choir stalls, the bishop's throne, and the pulpit. The cause ‚Äì arson ‚Äì soon became apparent, and the culprit was identified from threatening placards Martin had left on the Minster railings in previous days, including his initials and address. Martin was captured near Hexham on 6 February. He was tried at York Castle in March 1829, before Baron Hullock and a jury. The case was a national cause c√©l√®bre, coming only two months after the trials of Burke and Hare in Edinburgh. Martin was defended by Henry Brougham, who had gained notoriety for defending Queen Caroline in 1821. Despite the jury ruling that he was guilty on a capital charge, which should have resulted in a death sentence, the judge declared him not guilty on the grounds of insanity. He was detained in Bethlem Royal Hospital, where he remained until he died 9 years later. During this period of detention, he made a number of drawings, including self-portraits and an apocalyptic picture of the destruction of London. His son, Richard, from his first marriage, was brought up by Jonathan's brother John. Richard committed suicide in September 1838, three months after his father's death.

She is best known for having been one half of the trip hop duo Mandalay (along with Saul Freeman). Following the demise of Mandalay, she has worked with various dance music and avant-garde musicians including Chris Brann and Ryuichi Sakamoto but has more recently returned to her solo career. History=Childhood and musical roots Nicola Hitchcock's father was a musician, actor and script writer, TV producer/director ‚Äì her parents divorced, her father leaving the family home when Nicola was three. She has credited her father for her initial interest in music and for teaching her how to create her first songs. She began seriously writing songs from the age of nine, when she received her first acoustic guitar. Early influences included The Beatles and Carole King. From the age of 15, she began gaining stage experience in local covers bands, learning to play accordion, keyboards and percussion in addition to her vocal and guitar skills. While training as a teacher Hitchcock took the opportunity to learn from degree music students, gaining lessons on classical composition and opera singing as well as keyboard skills. Early work in bands During her twenties, Hitchcock gained work as a backing vocalist and multi- instrumentalist on the London live music circuit. She was for a time a member of Eternal Triangle, a London-based pop/new wave band who were signed to Beggars Banquet. In 1984 she contributed vocals and keyboards to their sole album, Touch and Let Go, as well as its two associated singles. In 1992 she wrote and recorded several 4-track demos performed solo as a voice-and-guitar act in various acoustic and folk clubs prior to being signed up by F-Beat/Demon Records. A Bowl of Chalk (first solo album) (1993) F-Beat Records signed her up for her first solo album, 1993's A Bowl of Chalk. A Bowl of Chalk was a low-key, stripped-down, acoustic vibe. Hitchcock added folk instrumentation such as whistle, accordion and hand drum, and several tracks featured the celebrated British jazz/folk musician Danny Thompson (ex- Pentangle/John Martyn) on double bass. (Other performers included Prefab Sprout drummer Neil Conti). In a Folk Roots magazine review, Colin Irwin praised Hitchcock's songwriting, commenting \\"there's something indefinably magical in her delivery and in the very human troubled personal conflicts in her exceptional lyrics... a remarkable debut.\\" The album yielded two singles, Pick Up Your Coat and My Mistake. The former featured an acoustic cover of Squeeze's Is That Love, performed as a duet with Chris Difford. A Bowl of Chalk boosted Hitchcock's reputation on London's folk and acoustic circuit and led to full band performances at the Guildford Folk Festival, the Cambridge Folk Festival and the Phoenix Festival. Unfortunately, F-Beat Records folded shortly afterwards and the album went out of print. Mandalay Recently inspired by the developing trip-hop music scene (as spearheaded by Massive Attack and Portishead), Hitchcock now began to seek out other musical opportunities. Replying to another advert in Melody Maker put her in touch with Chrysalis Music and with Saul Freeman. Freeman was a multi- instrumentalist/producer who had initially been the other half of the acclaimed pop duo Thieves, before a falling-out with his partner (singer David McAlmont) had left Freeman without a band and with his work released as McAlmont's debut album. Hitchcock and Freeman formed another pop duo, Mandalay, which blended Hitchcock's talent as a musician, singer-songwriter with Freeman's textured arrangements and his mixture of trip-hop dance smoothness and post-punk avant-garde textures. Mandalay were courted by various major labels on completion of their first demos, but opted instead to sign to David Steele's independent label Organic Records. Mandalay's first single release, \\"Flowers Bloom\\" gained the Single of the Week award in Melody Maker, immediately strengthening their position. They subsequently signed to V2 Records, for whom they would release two albums, Empathy and Instinct. Mandalay lasted for seven years, during which they received a good deal of critical acclaim and the tag of \\"Madonna's favourite band.\\" The project ended in 2002 due to musical and personal differences. Post-Mandalay Shortly before Mandalay's demise in 2001/2, Hitchcock's songwriting and vocal talents were sought out by Ti√´sto who chose her song \\"In My Memory\\" for his first album, of the same title. With a deft remix from him, it became the lead single for the album, the success of which led to a live performance by Hitchcock at the Dutch Music Awards in 2002. Hitchcock's career was interrupted by a car accident, a relocation to Devon and a period spent recuperating from the Epstein-Barr virus. However, during this time she continued to be sought out by artists, musicians, and DJs contacting her via the internet and email with requests for possible collaborations. She began working on tracks from avant garde composers Hector Zazou, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Lenny Ibizarre and the underground artist & DJ Chris Brann (Wamdue Project, P'taah etc.). Passive Aggressive (2005) In 2005, Hitchcock released her second solo album Passive Aggressive, on her own label Tempted Records. The album compiled many of her recent collaborations ‚Äì excluding \\"In My Memory\\" but including the work with Sakamoto, Brann, Ibizarre and Zazou (as well as newer work with Sounds from the Ground, the string trio Echo and frequent Thieves/Mandalay collaborator Michael J. Ade). Later work (2006 onwards) In 2006, Hitchcock was approached by Justin Elswick of the electronic dance project Sleepthief, which led to her co-writing and performing the song \\"You Did A Good Thing\\" on Sleepthief's debut album The Dawnseeker. In 2012, Hitchcock released a self-produced EP consisting of three new tracks \\"A Coeurs Vaillants\\", \\"Magic Heart\\" and the title track, \\"Quarterbright\\". She is currently working on her next solo release and also on new collaborations. In 2016, Hitchcock was a guest vocalist on Steve Jansen's Tender Extinction album on the track \\"Faced with Nothing\\".
