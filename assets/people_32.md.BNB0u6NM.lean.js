Based in the Mayo Clinic's main facility in Rochester, MN, the CFI has more than 50 full-time staff including service designers, project managers, information technology specialists, and clinicians working together to develop health care delivery solutions for Mayo's Clinic's 64,000 employees and half a million patients annually in Rochester as well at Mayo Clinic's branch facilities in Jacksonville, FL and Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ. History of the Center for Innovation Formally established as the Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation in 2008, the 50+ member multidisciplinary team has grown to be one of the largest among an increasing number of health care innovation centers at U.S. academic and non-profit medical centers. A precursor to the Center for Innovation, the SPARC Lab, was created in the Department of Medicine with a staff of two. By 2008, the SPARC Lab had grown to 24 full-time staff and was rechristened as the Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation. In its first three years, the CFI completed more than 100 innovation projects within the Mayo system, ranging from redesigning Mayo's traditional clinical exam room; to streamlining job descriptions and protocols in a dermatology clinic; to analyzing how hospital care teams hand off patients from one team to another; to supporting a project with a ‚Äústroke robot‚Äù that enables Mayo physicians to consult with patients from a remote location within seconds of the first possible signs of a stroke. The CFI's staff is built around a core of graduates from design schools and designers recruited from design firms and service-oriented companies. The Outpatient Lab In its early years, the CFI (then the SPARC Lab) developed the Outpatient Lab, where consenting patients were observed in prototypes of newly designed examination rooms that were altered in size, shape and configuration. These Outpatient Lab studies resulted in a redesign of Mayo Clinic's basic examination room. In the old room, the exam table was placed in the center of the room, with doctor-patient conversations held at a desk adjacent to the exam table. In the new configuration, doctors and patients chat with each other at a round table in a carpeted room that feels much like a living room, with the examination table, clothes-changing area and medical instruments located in an adjoining room. The Design Research Studio At the CFI's Design Research Studio, designers and project managers collaborate with Mayo physicians, nurses and care team members to brainstorm and prototype solutions to health care delivery problems. Project Management In 2009, project managers were added to the CFI staff, partly in recognition that the creative aspect of design thinking sometimes needs a counterbalancing force to keep projects driving towards deadlines, cost and quality control, and defined scope of work. SPARC Innovation Program The SPARC Innovation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, is widely recognized as the first design-based research and development laboratory for health services. Salter C. A Prescription for Innovation The brainchild of Drs. Nicholas F. LaRusso, Chair, Department of Medicine, and Michael D. Brennan, Associate Chair, Department of Medicine, the idea of SPARC began on a run. LaRusso and Brennan, both avid runners, imagined a space where new ideas might be thoroughly tested before implementation within the clinical practice. The two believed that its insular protection from the demands of the practice would improve the rate of innovation in health service delivery. This vision rapidly evolved when Ryan Armbruster was asked to lead the development of this capability. Consequently, they recruited Dr. Alan Kendall Duncan, Jennifer Dusso, Dr. Prathibha Varkey, and later Dr. Victor Montori to realize this vision, with designers (widely recognized as some of the first embedded designers working within a healthcare institution on healthcare experience & delivery): Maggie Breslin, Matt Maleska, Christine Janae - Leoniak, and J. Paul Neeley. In 2002, the group engaged the design firm IDEO to help envision the concept of a physical laboratory for service innovation. What emerged from a lengthy design process was a concept that was realized through additional design talent of Steelcase. The central feature of the laboratory was the concept of a design studio embedded in a clinical practice, placing designers, business strategists, and medical professionals in close proximity to permit collaborations on a variety of projects. The laboratory opened in June 2004. Its methodology, See-Plan- Act-Refine-Communicate, is a description of a design methodology that is rooted in the techniques of ethnography, prototyping, design thinking, and business integration. The laboratory was created through internal funds, philanthropic support, and a grant from the VHA Health Foundation. SPARC currently employees a staff of 10, including designers, business professionals, and health workers. The research group functions as a design consultancy and has worked on multiple projects over the course of over two years. They created the first patient-use service kiosk at Mayo Clinic Rochester; as well as creating a vision for the physical design of the ambulatory practice of the future.Anonymous Mayo Clinic SPARC Innovation Program Often, their work formed the basis for major transformational work at Mayo.

Jackson, with Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, James Remar, Michael Parks, and Don Johnson in supporting roles. Set in the Old West and Antebellum South, it is a highly-stylized, heavily- revisionist tribute to Spaghetti Westerns, in particular the 1966 Italian film Django by Sergio Corbucci, whose star Franco Nero has a cameo appearance. Development of Django Unchained began in 2007 when Tarantino was writing a book on Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final draft of the script to The Weinstein Company. Casting began in the summer of 2011, with Michael K. Williams and Will Smith being considered for the role of the title character before Foxx was cast. Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming, and Louisiana. Django Unchained premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 11, 2012, and was theatrically released on December 25, 2012, in the United States, grossing over $425 million worldwide against its $100 million budget, becoming Tarantino's highest-grossing movie to date. The film received numerous awards and nominations, as well as five nominations at the 85th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Waltz won several awards for his performance, among them Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTAs. For his screenplay, Tarantino won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA.  Plot  In early 1858 Texas, brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled black slaves on foot. Among them is Django, sold off and separated from his wife von Shaft, a house slave who speaks German and English. They are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter seeking to buy Django for his knowledge of the three outlawed Brittle brothers, overseers at the plantation of Django's previous owner and for whom Schultz has a warrant. When Ace levels his gun at Schultz, Schultz kills him and shoots Dicky's horse. As a result, the horse falls on top of Dicky, pinning him to the ground. Schultz insists on paying a fair price for Django before leaving Dicky to the newly freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. Schultz offers Django his freedom and $75 in exchange for help tracking down the Brittles. Django and Schultz kill the Brittle brothers at Spencer \\"Big Daddy\\" Bennett's Tennessee plantation. Bennett rounds up a posse whom Schultz ambushes with explosives, killing most of them while Django kills Bennett. Obliged to Django, Schultz takes him on as an apprentice and agrees to help him find and rescue . They return to Texas where Django collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill as a memento. He and Schultz rack up several bounties before spring, when they travel to Mississippi and learn that 's new owner is Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland plantation, where slaves are forced to wrestle to the death in brutal \\"Mandingo\\" fights. Schultz and Django hatch a plan. They know that if they offer to buy Broomhilda, Calvin will price her beyond reach, so they will instead offer for one of his best fighters as a pretext to acquiring Broomhilda for a nominal sum. They can then feign second thoughts about buying the fighter and leave with just Broomhilda. They meet Calvin at his gentlemen's club and make the offer. Intrigued, Calvin invites them to the Candyland plantation. En route, the group encounters Calvin's slave trackers who have cornered D'Artagnan, an escapee, and disfigured Mandingo fighter. Schultz attempts to pay Calvin to spare him, but Django intervenes, careful not to blow his and Schultz‚Äôs cover as hardened slavers. In response, Calvin has lead slave hunter Stonecipher release dogs at D'Artagnan, who mauls him to death. The sight upsets Schultz, but Django does not visibly react. Calvin asks Django why Schultz, supposedly in the business of forcing slaves to fight to the death, is so disturbed. Django tells Calvin that Schultz is used to seeing men die in fights, not be killed by dogs. Django says that Schultz, being a foreigner, is unaccustomed to America (by implication, condemning the uniquely vicious nature of American slavery). Having told of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her as his escort while negotiating the initial deal during dinner. Calvin's staunchly loyal head house slave Stephen realizes that knows Django, accurately deduces their plan and alerts Calvin. Calvin alters the deal at gunpoint to buy Broomhilda for $12,000 instead of the fighter. Schultz reluctantly agrees. During the sale's finalization, Calvin threatens to have Broomhilda shot if Schultz does not shake his hand to seal the deal, and Schultz instead shoots him dead. Calvin's bodyguard kills Schultz, and Django goes on a rampage, killing the bodyguard, the lawyer, and several of Calvin's gunhands, but is forced to surrender when Stephen takes hostage. The next morning, Django is tortured and about to be castrated when Stephen arrives, halting the torture to say that Calvin's sister Lara has taken charge and that Django will instead be sold to a mining company and worked to death. En route there, Django uses his first handbill to prove to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter. He claims the men on the handbill are at Candyland and promises the escorts all but $500 of the reward money. Once released, Django kills his escorts and returns to Candyland with a bag of dynamite. Recovering 's freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, Django avenges him and D‚ÄôArtagnan by killing Stonecipher and the other trackers and frees just as Calvin's mourners return from his burial. At the mansion, Django kills Lara and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen before igniting the dynamite he had planted throughout the mansion. Django and watch from a distance as the mansion explodes before riding off together.  Cast  Clockwise from top left: Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L.

Production = Development  Tarantino in Paris at the film's French premiere, January 2013 In 2007, Tarantino discussed an idea for a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film \\"a Southern\\", stating that he wanted: Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: Tarantino finished the script on April 26, 2011, and handed in the final draft to The Weinstein Company. In October 2012, frequent Tarantino collaborator RZA said that he and Tarantino had intended to cross over Django Unchained with RZA's Tarantino-presented martial-arts film The Man with the Iron Fists. The crossover would have seen a younger version of the blacksmith character from RZA's film appear as a slave in an auction. However, scheduling conflicts prevented RZA's participation. One inspiration for the film is Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django, whose star Franco Nero has a cameo appearance in Django Unchained. Another inspiration is the 1975 film Mandingo, about a slave trained to fight other slaves. Tarantino included scenes in the snow as a homage to The Great Silence. \\"Silenzio takes place in the snow. I liked the action in the snow so much, Django Unchained has a big snow section in the middle,\\" Tarantino said in an interview. The title Django Unchained alludes to the titles of the 1966 Corbucci film Django; Hercules Unchained, the American title for the 1959 Italian epic fantasy film Ercole e la regina di Lidia, about the mythical hero's escape from enslavement to a wicked master; and to Angel Unchained, the 1970 American biker film about a biker exacting revenge on a large group of rednecks.  Casting  Among those considered for the title role of Django, Michael K. Williams and Will Smith were mentioned as possibilities, but in the end Jamie Foxx was cast in the role. Smith later said he turned down the role because it \\"wasn't the lead\\". Tyrese Gibson sent in an audition tape as the character. Franco Nero, the original Django from the 1966 Italian film, was rumored for the role of Calvin Candie, but instead was given a cameo appearance as a minor character. Nero suggested that he play a mysterious horseman who haunts Django in visions and is revealed in an ending flashback to be Django's father; Tarantino opted not to use the idea. Kevin Costner was in negotiations to join as Ace Woody, a Mandingo trainer and Candie's right-hand man, but Costner dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Kurt Russell was cast instead but also later left the role. When Kurt Russell dropped out, the role of Ace Woody was not recast; instead, the character was merged with Walton Goggins's character, Billy Crash. Jonah Hill was offered the role of Scotty Harmony, a gambler who loses to Candie in a poker game, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with The Watch. Sacha Baron Cohen was also offered the role, but declined in order to appear in Les Mis√©rables. Neither Scotty nor the poker game appear in the final cut of the film. Hill later appeared in the film in a different role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt said that he \\"would have loved, loved to have\\" been in the film but would be unable to appear because of a prior commitment to direct his first film, Don Jon.  Costume design  Django's valet costume was inspired by Thomas Gainsborough's 1770 oil painting, The Blue Boy. In a January 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, costume designer Sharen Davis said much of the film's wardrobe was inspired by spaghetti westerns and other works of art. For Django's wardrobe, Davis and Tarantino watched the television series Bonanza and referred to it frequently. The pair even hired the hatmaker who designed the hat worn by the Bonanza character Little Joe, played by Michael Landon. Davis described Django's look as a \\"rock-n-roll take on the character\\". Django's sunglasses were inspired by Charles Bronson's character in The White Buffalo (1977). Davis used Thomas Gainsborough's 1770 oil painting The Blue Boy as a reference for Django's valet outfit. In the final scene, wears a dress similar to that of Ida Galli's character in Blood for a Silver Dollar (1965). Davis said the idea of Calvin Candie's costume came partly from Rhett Butler, and that Don Johnson's signature Miami Vice look inspired Big Daddy's cream-colored linen suit in the film. King Schultz's faux chinchilla coat was inspired by Telly Savalas in Kojak. Davis also revealed that many of her costume ideas did not make the final cut of the film, leaving some unexplained characters such as Zo√´ Bell's tracker, who was intended to drop her bandana to reveal an absent jaw.  Filming  Principal photography for Django Unchained started in California in November 2011 continuing in Wyoming in February 2012 and at the National Historic Landmark Evergreen Plantation in Wallace, Louisiana, outside of New Orleans, in March 2012. The film was shot in the anamorphic format on 35 mm film. Although originally scripted, a sub- plot centering on Zo√´ Bell's masked tracker was cut, and remained unfilmed, due to time constraints. After 130 shooting days, the film wrapped up principal photography in July 2012. Django Unchained was the first Tarantino film not edited by Sally Menke, who died in 2010. Editing duties were instead handled by Fred Raskin, who had worked as an assistant editor on Tarantino's Kill Bill. Raskin was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Editing but lost to William Goldenberg for his work on Argo.  Music  The film features both original and existing music tracks. Tracks composed specifically for the film include \\"100 Black Coffins\\" by Rick Ross and produced by and featuring Jamie Foxx, \\"Who Did That To You?\\" by John Legend, \\"Ancora Qui\\" by Ennio Morricone and Elisa, and \\"Freedom\\" by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton. The theme, \\"Django\\", was also the theme song of the 1966 film. Musician Frank Ocean wrote an original song for the film's soundtrack, but it was rejected by Tarantino, who explained that \\"Ocean wrote a fantastic ballad that was truly lovely and poetic in every way, there just wasn't a scene for it.\\" Frank Ocean later published the song, entitled \\"Wiseman\\", on his Tumblr blog. The film also features a few famous pieces of western classical music, including Beethoven's \\"F√ºr Elise\\" and \\"Dies Irae\\" from Verdi's Requiem. Tarantino has stated that he avoids using full scores of original music: \\"I just don't like the idea of giving that much power to anybody on one of my movies.\\" The film's soundtrack album was released on December 18, 2012. Ennio Morricone made statements criticizing Tarantino's use of his music in Django Unchained and stated that he would \\"never work\\" with the director after this film, but later agreed to compose an original film score for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight in 2015. In a scholarly essay on the film's music, Hollis Robbins notes that the vast majority of film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate Django Unchained squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema. Jim Croce's hit \\"I Got a Name\\" was featured in the soundtrack.  Release = Marketing  The first teaser poster was inspired by a fan-art poster by Italian artist Federico Mancosu. His artwork was published in May 2011, a few days after the synopsis and the official title were released to the public. In August 2011, at Tarantino's request, the production companies bought the concept artwork from Mancosu to use for promotional purposes as well as on the crew passes and clothing for staff during filming.  Theatrical run  Django Unchained was released on December 25, 2012, in the United States by The Weinstein Company and released on January 18, 2013, by Sony Pictures Releasing in the United Kingdom. The film was screened for the first time at the Directors Guild of America on December 1, 2012, with additional screening events having been held for critics leading up to the film's wide release. The premiere of Django Unchained was delayed by one week following the shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012. The film was released on March 22, 2013, by Sony Pictures in India. In March 2013, Django Unchained was announced to be the first Tarantino film approved for official distribution in China's strictly controlled film market. Lily Kuo, writing for Quartz, wrote that \\"the film depicts one of America's darker periods, when slavery was legal, which Chinese officials like to use to push back against criticism from the United States\\". The film was released in China on May 12, 2013.  Home media  The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital Download on April 16, 2013. In the United States, the film has grossed $31,939,733 from DVD sales and $30,286,838 from Blu-ray sales, making a total of $62,226,571.  Reception = Box office  Django Unchained grossed $162.8 million in the United States and Canada and $262.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $425.4 million, against a production budget of $100 million. , Django Unchained is Tarantino's highest-grossing film, surpassing his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, which grossed $321.4 million worldwide. In North America, the film made $15 million on Christmas Day, finishing second behind fellow opener Les Mis√©rables. It was the third-biggest opening day figure for a film on Christmas, following Sherlock Holmes ($24.6 million) and Les Mis√©rables ($18.1 million). It went on to make $30.1 million in its opening weekend (a six-day total of $63.4 million), finishing second behind holdover The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.  Critical and scholarly response  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 288 reviews, and an average rating of 8.03/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Bold, bloody, and stylistically daring, Django Unchained is another incendiary masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, gives the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and said: \\"The film offers one sensational sequence after another, all set around these two intriguing characters who seem opposites but share pragmatic, financial and personal issues.\\" Ebert also added, \\"had I not been prevented from seeing it sooner because of an injury, this would have been on my year's best films list.\\" Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, awarded the film five stars, writing: \\"I can only say Django delivers, wholesale, that particular narcotic and delirious pleasure that Tarantino still knows how to confect in the cinema, something to do with the manipulation of surfaces. It's as unwholesome, deplorable and delicious as a forbidden cigarette.\\" Writing in The New York Times, critic A. O. Scott compared Django to Tarantino's earlier Inglourious Basterds: \\"Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness.\\" Designating the film a Times \\"critics\\" pick, Scott said Django is \\"a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.\\" Filmmaker Michael Moore praised Django, tweeting that the movie \\"is one of the best film satires ever.\\" To the contrary, Owen Gleiberman, film critic for the Entertainment Weekly, wrote: \\"Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was. It's less clever, and it doesn't have enough major characters ‚Äì or enough of Tarantino's trademark structural ingenuity ‚Äì to earn its two-hour- and-45-minute running time.\\" In his review for the Indy Week, David Fellerath wrote: \\"Django Unchained shows signs that Tarantino did little research beyond repeated viewings of Sergio Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti Western Django and a blaxploitation from 1975 called Boss Nigger, written by and starring Fred Williamson.\\" New Yorkers Anthony Lane was \\"disturbed by their [Tarantino's fans'] yelps of triumphant laughter, at the screening I attended, as a white woman was blown away by Django's guns.\\" An entire issue of the academic journal Safundi was devoted to Django Unchained in \\"Django Unchained and the Global Western,\\" featuring scholars who contextualize Tarantino's film as a classic \\"western\\". Dana Phillips writes: \\"Tarantino's film is immensely entertaining, not despite but because it is so very audacious‚Äîeven, at times, downright lurid, thanks to its treatment of slavery, race relations, and that staple of the Western violence. No doubt these are matters that another director would have handled more delicately, and with less stylistic excess, than Tarantino, who has never been bashful. Another director also would have been less willing to proclaim his film the first in a new genre, the 'Southern'.\\"Phillips, Dana. \\"Introduction: Django Unchained and the Global Western\\".

Christoph Waltz received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor, his second time receiving all three awards, having previously won for his role in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. The NAACP Image Awards gave the film four nominations, while the National Board of Review named DiCaprio their Best Supporting Actor. Django Unchained earned a nomination for Best Theatrical Motion Picture from the Producers Guild of America.  Controversy = Portrayal of African Americans and slavery  Some commentators thought that the film's heavy usage of the word \\"nigger\\" is inappropriate, affecting them to an even greater extent than the depicted violence against the slaves. Other reviewers have defended the usage of the language in the historic context of race and slavery in the United States. African-American filmmaker Spike Lee, in an interview with Vibe, said he would not see the film, explaining \\"All I'm going to say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just me ... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else.\\" Lee later wrote, \\"American slavery was not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It was a Holocaust. My ancestors are slaves stolen from Africa. I will honor them.\\" Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, interpreted the movie as \\"preparation for race war\\". Actor and activist Jesse Williams has contrasted accuracy of the racist language used in the film with what he sees as the film's lack of accuracy about the general lives of slaves, too often portrayed as \\"well-dressed Negresses in flowing gowns, frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds, as if the setting is Versailles, mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves ... That authenticity card that Tarantino uses to buy all those 'niggers' has an awfully selective memory.\\" He also criticizes the lack of solidarity between slave characters, and their general lack of a will to escape from slavery, with Django as the notable exception. Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe compared Samuel L. Jackson's Stephen character to black Republicans like Clarence Thomas or Herman Cain. Samuel L. Jackson said that he believed his character to have \\"the same moral compass as Clarence Thomas does\\". Jackson defended heavy use of the word \\"nigger\\": \\"Saying Tarantino said 'nigger' too many times is like complaining they said 'kyke' [sic] too many times in a movie about Nazis.\\" The review by Jesse Williams notes, however, that these antisemitic terms were not used nearly as frequently in Tarantino's film about Nazis, Inglourious Basterds, suggesting the Jewish community would not have accepted it. Marc Lamont Hill, a professor at Temple University, compared the fugitive ex‚ÄìLos Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner to a real-life Django, saying \\"It's almost like watching 'Django Unchained' in real life. It's kind of exciting.\\" Writing in the Los Angeles Times, journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino's Jackie Brown and Django Unchained: \\"It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating, yet Django does exactly that, either to enlighten or entertain. A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70s blaxploitation √† la Jackie Brown is one thing, but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another.\\" While hosting NBC's Saturday Night Live, Jamie Foxx joked about being excited \\"to kill all the white people in the movie\\". Conservative columnist Jeff Kuhner wrote a reaction to the SNL skit for The Washington Times, saying: \\"Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture. Take Django Unchained. The movie boils down to one central theme: the white man as devil‚Äîa moral scourge who must be eradicated like a lethal virus.\\" Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that \\"Django Unchained was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than 12 Years a Slave, but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he's respected for making supposedly art films, it's held in higher esteem than Django, because that was basically a blaxploitation movie.\\"  Use of violence  Some reviews criticized the film for being too violent. The originally planned premiere of Django was postponed following the Sandy Hook school shooting on December 14, 2012. Thomas Frank criticized the film's use of violence as follows: > Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this > sort of criticism (about the relationship between the movies and acts of > violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right around > the time of the Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give > an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. > Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make- > believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a > realistic experience, but we are faking it.

But do they really > believe that imaginative expression is without consequence?Frank, Thomas > (March 2013) \\"Blood Sport.\\" Harper's Magazine; page 6-7. The Independent said the movie was part of \\"the new sadism in cinema\\" and added, \\"There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest garroting or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off\\". Adam Serwer from Mother Jones said, \\"Django, like many Tarantino films, also has been criticized as cartoonishly violent, but it is only so when Django is killing slave owners and overseers. The violence against slaves is always appropriately terrifying. This, if nothing else, puts Django in the running for Tarantino's best film, the first one in which he discovers violence as horror rather than just spectacle. When Schultz turns his head away from a slave being torn apart by dogs, Django explains to Calvin Candie‚Äîthe plantation owner played by Leo DiCaprio‚Äîthat Schultz just isn't used to Americans.\\"  Historical inaccuracies  Although Tarantino has said about Mandingo fighting, \\"I was always aware those things existed\\", there is no definitive historical evidence that slave owners ever staged gladiator-like fights to the death between male slaves like the fight depicted in the movie. Historian Edna Greene Medford notes that there are only undocumented rumors that such fights took place. David Blight, the director of Yale's center for the study of slavery, said it was not a matter of moral or ethical reservations that prevented slave owners from pitting slaves against each other in combat, but rather economic self- interest: slave owners would not have wanted to put their substantial financial investments at risk in gladiatorial battles. The non-historical term \\"Mandingo\\" for a fine fighting or breeding slave comes not from Tarantino, but the 1975 film 'Mandingo'Daniel Bernardi, The Persistence of Whiteness: Race and Contemporary ...- 2013 \\"For the purposes of breeding chattel, he must also buy a \\"Mandingo\\" buck, a male slave. In the film, a \\"Mandingo\\" represents the finest stock of slaves deemed most suitable for fighting and breeding.\\" which was itself based on a 1957 novel with the same title. Writing in The New Yorker, William Jelani Cobb observed that Tarantino's occasional historical elasticity sometimes worked to the film's advantage. \\"There are moments,\\" Cobb wrote, \\"where this convex history works brilliantly, like when Tarantino depicts the Ku Klux Klan a decade prior to its actual formation in order to thoroughly ridicule its members' veiled racism.\\" However, Tarantino holds that the masked marauders depicted in the film were not the KKK, but a group known as \\"The Regulators\\". They were depicted as spiritual forebears of the later post-civil war KKK and not as the actual KKK. On the matter of historical accuracy, Christopher Caldwell wrote in the Financial Times: \\"Of course, we must not mistake a feature film for a public television documentary\\", pointing out that the film should be treated as entertainment, not as a historical account of the time period it is set in. \\"Django uses slavery the way a pornographic film might use a nurses' convention: as a pretext for what is really meant to entertain us. What is really meant to entertain us in Django is violence.\\" Richard Brody, however, wrote in The New Yorker that Tarantino's \\"vision of slavery's monstrosity is historically accurate.... Tarantino rightly depicts slavery as no mere administrative ownership but a grievous and monstrous infliction of cruelty.\\"  Alleged copyright infringement  In December 2015, a $100 million lawsuit was filed against Tarantino by filmmakers Oscar Colvin Jr. and Torrance J. Colvin, who claimed that the script for Django Unchained bears extensive similarities to their film, titled Freedom. The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Washington, DC. On January 24, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed.  In other media  In the 2014 film A Million Ways to Die in the West, Foxx makes a cameo appearance as Django. He is seen shooting the proprietor of a racist shooting game called Runaway Slave, saying \\"people die at the fair\\".  Crossover sequel  A comic book adaptation of Django Unchained was released by DC Comics in 2013. In 2015, a sequel crossover comic entitled Django/Zorro was released by Dynamite Entertainment, written by Tarantino, the latter being the first comic book sequel to a Quentin Tarantino film. In June 2019, Tarantino had picked Jerrod Carmichael to co-write a film adaptation based on the Django/Zorro crossover comic book series. Tarantino and Jamie Foxx have both expressed interest in having Antonio Banderas reprise his role as Zorro from The Mask of Zorro and The Legend of Zorro in the film in addition to Foxx himself reprising his role as Django.  Miniseries  Tarantino has said in an interview that he has 90 minutes of unused material and considered re-editing Django Unchained into a four-hour, four-night cable miniseries. Tarantino said that breaking the story into four parts would be more satisfying to audiences than a four-hour movie: \\"... it wouldn't be an endurance test. It would be a miniseries. And people love those.\\"  Novels  The story which became the director's follow-up film The Hateful Eight was first attempted as a paperback novel sequel to Django Unchained titled Django in White Hell. Tarantino decided, however, that the character's established morals did not fit the tone of the developing story so he began re-writing it as an original screenplay with no connection to the earlier film. He has also expressed a desire to write a series of Django sequel novels.

The American division Macmillan US published an edition in the same year. Opening in the fictitious village of Midmeddlecum, evidently in contemporary rural England, it features two girls whose father is absent during a war. They pursue magical, bizarre, or dangerous experiences. A \\"wind on the moon\\" is said to be the cause, \\"making them behave badly for a year\\". Linklater won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognizing the year's best children's book by a British subject. Plot summary Major Palfrey is off to war.

Because if it is an ill wind and you behave badly, it will blow straight into your heart, and then you will behave badly for a long time to come.\\" And so it proves: before long the girls are drinking a potion provided by the local witch and turning into kangaroos, getting stuck in the zoo, and staging an escape along with their new friends, a golden puma and a silver falcon.

Procop√© was a minister in several cabinets in the 1920s and 1930s. Hjalmar Procop√© was born on 8 August 1889 to Major General Carl Albert Fredrik Procop√© and Elin Hedvig Vendla von T√∂rne. After matriculating in 1907, Procop√© studied law at Helsinki University (then the Imperial University of Finland). He graduated in 1914 and received the title of varatuomari (Master of Laws trained on the bench) in 1916. Between 1915 and 1922 Procop√© worked as an attorney in Helsinki. He worked in the Finnish embassy in Berlin from spring 1918 to his resignation in the end of the same year. Procop√© was a Member of the Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta) from 1919 to 1922 and 1924 to 1926. His political party was the Swedish People‚Äôs Party. Hjalmar Procop√© served as minister on several occasions: * Minister of Trade and Industry 1920-1921 in Erich‚Äôs Cabinet *Minister of Trade and Industry 1924 in Cajander‚Äôs second Cabinet *Minister of Foreign Affairs 1924-1925 in Ingman‚Äôs second Cabinet *Minister of Foreign Affairs 1927-1931 in Cabinets Sunila I, Mantere, Kallio III and Svinhufvud II In between of his two first terms as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Procop√© served as Envoy of Finland in Warsaw 1926‚Äì1927. After his career as minister he worked as CEO of Finnish Paper Mills‚Äô Association (Suomen Paperitehtaiden Yhdistys) from 1931 to 1939. Procop√© was awarded the special title of Minister (ministeri) in 1931. Hjalmar Procop√© served as Envoy of Finland in Washington D.C. during the war years 1939‚Äì1944. According to Finnish National Archive researcher Kauko Rumpunen, Franklin Roosevelt warned Procop√© about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its contents on 28 August 1939. Prior to this Procop√© had received information about the pact from other sources and he informed Finland with a telegram on 23 August 1939, the day the pact was signed. Roosevelt‚Äôs warning officially arrived in Finland a month after the meeting between Roosevelt and Procop√© as part of a routine report. This report was not taken entirely seriously by the government of Finland, partly due to the fact that Roosevelt never revealed the original source of the tip, a subordinate of Joachim von Ribbentrop. During the Winter War (30 November 1939 ‚Äì 13 March 1940) Procop√© used the sympathy of Americans to benefit the interests of Finland. The political situation changed in late summer 1944 when Finland and Nazi Germany became enemies. Hjalmar Procop√© was put into awaiting posting and he resigned from the service of the Foreign Ministry in November 1945. Procop√© was the defense counsel of President Risto Ryti during the War- responsibility trials 1945‚Äì1946 and at the same time the defense leader of all defendants of the trials. During his last years Procop√© participated in anti- communist activities in Finland, and later resided in exile in Stockholm and New York. Procop√© died in Helsinki while visiting Finland in order to vote in the 1954 Finnish parliamentary election. One of Procop√©'s cousins was the journalist and poet Hjalmar F. E.

Allen grew up in Citra, Florida and played college football at The Citadel. Allen was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. High school career Born in San Diego, California, Allen graduated from North Marion High School of Citra, Florida in 2006 prior to being recruited to The Citadel. While in high school, Allen played varsity football only in his senior year and also ran on the track and field team. Allen earned all-state and all-city football honors in his one year of varsity football and was part of the 2005 regional championship team. College career Allen posted 120 tackles and 5 interceptions in his career with the Bulldogs football team of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, returning two for touchdowns.ESPN stats page As a freshman in 2006, Allen played in four games and had one assisted and one solo tackle. He redshirted the 2007 season. In 2008, as a sophomore, Allen played all 12 games and started 6. Against Furman (October 18), Allen made a season-high seven tackles, and against Samford (October 25), Allen made six tackles (including one for loss) and broke up one pass. In his junior season (2009), Allen played and started in all 11 games. Of his 57 total tackles in 2009, 36 were solo.

Allen was invited to the NFL combine and performed all the position drills and workouts. At the Citadel's Pro Day on March 28, 2011, he stood on his combine numbers but performed the vertical again, posting 37 1/2 inches this time. Scouts were very high on his physical tools and size but said he had to develop his awareness and was a raw prospect lacking the natural coverage instincts that are needed to be an NFL starter. Pittsburgh Steelers The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Allen in the fourth round (128th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. =2011= On July 28, 2011, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Allen to a four-year, $2.43 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $293,625.

Life He was born 29 November 1718, and was educated at Hitchin, Hertfordshire. He was apprenticed to a hosier, and on the expiration of his articles took up his freedom of the city, and opened a shop in Leadenhall Street, London. He was admitted to the livery of his company and chosen a member of the court of assistants. In order to learn the art of painting on glass he gave up the hosiery business, but about 1748 accepted a situation as purser's clerk to three ships belonging to the East India Company. After an adventure with some French men-of-war at Tellicherry, he made a long overland journey with a small company of Indians, adopted a form of local dress and let his beard grow. On returning to England he drew plans of settlements, for which the company gave him a grant. These plans were included in a publication issued by Bowles, printseller, near Mercers' Chapel. Herbert then established himself as a chart-engraver and printseller on London Bridge. A fire, which took place on the bank of the River Thames suggested to him the plan of a floating fire- engine, which was afterwards carried into practical effect. When the houses on London Bridge were pulled down, about 1758, Herbert moved to a shop in Leadenhall Street, on the site afterwards covered by an addition to the India House. After a short stay in Leadenhall Street he moved to 27 Goulston Square, Whitechapel. Herbert sold his business and stock to Henry Gregory for a thousand guineas, and retired to a country house at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. He died childless, 18 March 1795, in his seventy-seventh year, and was buried in Cheshunt churchyard. He had married his first wife about the time of his residence on London Bridge. He married a second time to a niece of the Rev. Mr. Newman, pastor of the meeting in Carter Lane, a woman with money. He brought out catalogues of books, charts, and maps,‚Äô and his business profits, added to his wife's income, enabled him to live well and to buy old books and manuscripts. After the death of his second wife he married Philippa, daughter of John Croshold, mayor of Norwich, and niece of Robert Marsham of Stratton Strawless, Norfolk, who also brought him a good fortune. She died in 1808. Works In 1758 he published, ‚Äòat the Golden Globe, under the Piazzas, London Bridge,‚Äô ‚ÄòA new Directory for the East Indies, with general and particular charts for the navigation of those seas, wherein the French Neptune Oriental has been chiefly considered and examined, with additions, corrections, and explanatory notes,‚Äô a quarto volume, with folio charts. Herbert, who calls himself ‚Äòhydrographer,‚Äô states in the dedication to the East India Company, ‚Äòall that has been set forth in the Neptune Oriental has been carefully examined and compared with the particular remarks and journals of ships in your honour's service, as also some country ones, besides many curious charts and plans I have been favoured with, as well as many collected whilst I was in India.‚Äô A second and third edition, unaltered, were issued. William Nicholson supplied the practical sea-knowledge. A fourth edition, ‚Äòwith additions,‚Äô was published by Herbert's successor in 1775; a fifth edition, ‚Äòenlarged by S. Dunn,‚Äô appeared in 1780. When in Goulston Square he published the second edition of ‚ÄòThe Ancient and Present State of Gloucestershire,‚Äô by Sir Robert Atkyns (1768). Joseph Ames's interleaved copy of his Typographical Antiquities, with the plates, blocks, and copyright, came into Herbert's possession, and in 1780 he issued proposals for a new edition, upon which he had then been engaged twenty years. He searched the registers of the Company of Stationers, worked in public and private libraries of the kingdom, and carried on correspondence with owners of rare books. Some of his letters to Cole, Steevens, Chiswell, Dalrymple, G. Mason, and others are preserved by John Nichols in his Literary Anecdotes and Illustrations. His edition of the Typographical Antiquities increased three times the size of the original of Ames. In 1785 was published the first volume;Typographical Antiquities, or an Historical Account of the Origin and Progress of Printing in Great Britain and Ireland; containing Memoirs of our ancient Printers, and a Register of Books printed by them, from the year 1471 to 1500. Begun by the late Joseph Ames, considerably augmented, both in the Memoirs and number of books. the book was favourably reviewed, the second volume appeared in 1786, and the third and concluding volume in 1790. The unfinished edition of Thomas Frognall Dibdin did not supersede it. His library of old English books was dispersed after his death; a catalogue of some of his books was published in 1796 by his nephew, Isaac Herbert, bookseller, of 29 Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury.

Elliott, a casualty of the Battle of Washita River in 1868. The decision to establish Fort Elliott in what was to become Wheeler County, Texas, was made in December 1874 by Colonel Nelson A. Miles as an advance supply post during the campaign to clear the Texas Panhandle of American Indians after the Second Battle of Adobe Walls in 1874. Major James Biddle established a temporary post on 3 February 1875 with four troops of the 6th US Cavalry and four companies of the 5th Infantry and the permanent location of the fort on 5 June 1875, twenty-seven miles west of Indian Territory near the headwaters of Sweetwater Creek.Crimmins, M.L., 1947, Fort Elliott, Texas, in The West Texas Historical Association Year Book, Vol. XXIII, October 1947, Abilene African-American troops, familiarly called \\"Buffalo soldiers,\\" served in this area. In subsequent years, the fort was garrisoned to protect the borders of the Panhandle with Indian Territory, and the cattle drives from Texas to Kansas. The town of Mobeetie in Wheeler County, where Timothy Dwight Hobart and Temple Lea Houston were early settlers, grew beside it. Among the troops serving there were Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper, the first black graduate of West Point Military Academy, Captain Emerson H. Liscum and Lieutenant Frederick Dent Grant. Fort Elliott had a dual purpose: first to quiet the Indians on the reservation while the slaughter of the bison continued, and second to encourage Anglo-Americans to settle beyond the 100th meridian. As soon as the fort was established, the cattle industry expanded throughout northwest Texas. Ranches were established on the open range between 1876, with the JA Ranch, and 1886, with the fencing of the XIT Ranch. Fort Elliott was situated on a high elevation of Sweetwater Creek, with the front of the shoe facing the southwest.Lester Fields Sheffy, The Life and Times of Timothy Dwight Hobart, 1855-1935: Colonization of West Texas (Canyon, Texas: Panhandle-Plains Historical Society, 1950), p. 137 ReferencesExternal links * Category:Closed installations of the United States Army Elliot Category:Buildings and structures in Wheeler County, Texas ","title":"Fort Elliott"},{"id":"31638999","text":"The King Faisal Air Academy () is a military officer academy and flight school in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia founded on 10 January 1968.

Career Rabboni was built in San Francisco, California, and launched on April 9, 1865. The tug was brought north to the mouth of the Columbia river, arriving in July 1865, and reaching Portland, Oregon on July 29, 1865. The vessel was commanded by Capt. Paul Corno, who was also its main owner. En route Rabboni had stopped at Coos Bay and procured a three-month supply of coal, and picked up 18,000 board feet of lumber. On August 10, 1865, Rabboni towed in the bark Almatia, which became the first vessel towed across the Columbia bar by a regular tug.Wright, ed. Lewis and Dryden Marine History, at 138, 147, 397. Rabboni was considered a good tug for the time, but ran into opposition at the Columbia from the bar pilots and prejudice among sailing ship owners against steam craft of any kind. In March, 1866 Rabboni proving unable to win sufficient business, was returned to San Francisco. After many years out of the area, Rabboni was returned to the Pacific Northwest, this time to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, in an effort to pick up tow work from inbound ships headed for ports in Puget Sound. This placed Rabboni in opposition to the powerful Puget Sound Tug Company, and again Rabboni proved unable to compete. There was thereafter no steam tug on the Columbia river bar until 1869. In 1890, Rabboni came under the ownership of F.B. Cornwall. By 1898 Rabboni had been laid up for some time at the Stetson and Post lumber mill in Seattle. The Klondike gold rush created a great demand for shipping, which resulted, as one historian as written, in ‚Äúlarge number of old vessels pulled off the mudflats and out of backwater sloughs from Oakland Creek to British Columbia.\\"Newell, H.W. McCurdy Marine History, at 31. Rabboni was one of these vessels, and was refitted for tow work in Alaska, but proved to be unsuccessful. Reconstruction In 1900, Rabboni, still owned by F.B. Cornwall, was rebuilt, and a new compound steeple-type steam engine was installed. Rabboni was last used in service for the Bellingham Bay Improvement Company, whose lumber mills were controlled by Cornwall. Notes References  * Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W.

Biography He was born in Rionero in Vulture (Basilicata), from a bourgeois family. His uncle Giustino Fortunato (1777-1862) was the prime minister of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from 1849 to 1852. Fortunato studied at the Jesuit College and then studied law at the university in Naples. After the degree, he founded the journals Unit√† Nazionale and Patria. In May 1880, he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Fortunato, along with other politician like Pasquale Villari, Francesco Saverio Nitti, Gaetano Salvemini formed a group of socio-political thinker called ‚Äúmeridionalisti‚Äù (‚Äúsouthernists‚Äù), in order to solve the economic problems of southern Italy after the Italian unification. Fortunato and others made the strong claim that the economic policies of the central government of the new state discriminated against the interests of the south while favoring those of north. In his last years he moved away from his native country because of misunderstanding of his fellow citizens and two incidents that showed the ingratitude of the people, such as in 1917, when he was stabbed by a farmer in Rionero, which accused him of having supported the war. Fortunato died in Naples at the age of 83.  Works  *Ricordi di Napoli, Milano, Treves, (1874). *I Napoletani del 1799, Firenze, G. Barb√®ra, (1884). *Santa Maria di Vitalba, Trani, V.

The Odyssey had originally been conceived and engineered in Japan, in the wake of country's economic crisis of the 1990s ‚Äì which in turn imposed severe constraints on the vehicle's size and overall concept, dictating the minivan's manufacture in an existing facility with minimal modification. The result was a smaller minivan, in the compact MPV class, that was well received in the Japanese domestic market and less well received in North America. The first generation Odyssey was marketed in Europe as the Honda Shuttle. Subsequent generations diverged to reflect market variations, and Honda built a plant in Lincoln, Alabama, incorporating the ability to manufacture larger models. Since model year 1999, Honda has marketed a larger (large MPV-class) Odyssey in North America and a smaller Odyssey in Japan and other markets. Honda also offered the larger North American Odyssey in Japan as the Honda LaGreat between 1999 and 2004.  First generation (RA1-RA5; 1994)  The Honda Odyssey was a raised wagon from Honda and was launched in Japan and North America in 1994.Global Viewpoints Honda's Japanese Odyssey It was offered with an optional 4WD (with RA2 and RA4 chassis), and from 1997 a 3.0L V6 J30A engine with the RA5 chassis (Prestige version). L and Aero models were equipped with a sunroof. All the JDM Odysseys had the double-air conditioning system, separate for the front and rear seaters. Since the first generation all the models have been six or seven seater versions. In 1995, it won the Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference Car of the Year award in Japan. In Japan, the Odyssey competed with Toyota Gaia, Toyota Ipsum and the Nissan Bassara.

However, this new Odyssey was a major upgrade of the first generation Odyssey rather than a completely new model. As a result, its overall shape and appearance were similar to the first generation Odyssey. Still, it was longer and wider than the previous model. While base models had slightly smaller dimensions and a smaller 2.3L engine, models with more options as well those with the 3.0L V6 engine featured slightly larger bumpers and chrome inserts, larger grille as well as a unique chrome number plate surround. The base model continued to be sold with a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine F23A in RA6 (2WD) & RA7 (4WD) models. The 3.0-liter J30A VTEC V6 engine from the first generation, producing now 210 hp (154.5kW) was available with RA8 (2WD) and RA9 (4WD) Prestige luxury and Absolute sport models. The 2000 Odyssey was the first Honda to receive a five-speed automatic transmission (with the 3.0-liter engine). All the second generation gearboxes also featured another first‚Äîa tiptronic-like manual mode, known as \\"Honda S-matic\\", in which a gearbox remains to be a classic Honda's hydro-automat, but the driver is able to manage the shifting moment (if electronically allowed) with the selector's \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" positions. The interior was completely new. The old automatic column shifter was moved to the centre console. A new touchscreen-based digital climate control system replaced the old manual controls, which worked in conjunction with Honda's new navigation system. Woodgrain trim was standard on all models, while in VG/VZ V6 models leather and velour seat and door materials were standard over the basic cloth trims. The interior configuration was also changed (second and third row), and the spare wheel was moved to a new position beneath the third row. With L and Absolute versions, an additional third-row heater was added. The sunroof was no longer available respectively. In 2002, the Odyssey was given a mild restyle. It received new, larger Honda emblems for the front and rear, clear-lens tail lights (replacing amber, darker in Absolute trim), and a larger front grille with four chrome strips instead of three as well as new alloy wheel design options. In the Australian market, the new Odyssey proved more popular than its predecessor, at least initially. However, in 2002, sales hit an all-time low, and in 2003, sales of only 649 units were almost one-third of the total in 2000.

Going on sale in Japan in October 2003, and in Australia and many other countries from early 2004, it continued with a 5-door body style, with a much sleeker, lower, and more car-like appearance. For the first time cruise-control appeared on the JDM Odyssey. The 4WD version has received the new DPS system. The seat folding mechanism was changed again. The height of the new Odyssey was lower than ever ‚Äì designed with multi-level parking in mind, particularly for Japan. The new Odyssey came with the Honda K24A i-VTEC engine, a 2.4 L unit producing ; this was the same engine used in the CR-V and Accord. A 4WD version (RB2) came only with an automatic transmission, while the 2WD version came only with a continuously variable transmission, except Absolute, JDB S/B model as well as export models. The V6 engine was dropped completely. Instead, a variant of the K24A engine was adopted for the sporty Absolute version ( with 4WD), which was only equipped with an automatic transmission ‚Äì both the 2WD & 4WD variants. Moreover, this new engine had the same fuel consumption as the old 2.2 engine. All this resulted in the new Odyssey becoming a sales success. In Australia, the Odyssey achieved its best-ever sales year in 2005, and outsold the Toyota Tarago for the first time.

The engine and transmission has fundamentally remained the same as the third generation, adding more power and better fuel economy. It is equipped with a 2.4-litre engine and CVT with a torque converter for the FWD, and 5-speed automatic transmission for 4WD and high-output 206 hp Absolute trim. Two engines are offered in Japan: one with 173 PS output (i-VTEC is only for intake camshaft) and the other one with 206 PS output in Absolute trim (i-VTEC is for both camshafts).

This current model also replaced the Elysion to compete against Toyota Alphard and Nissan Elgrand in the full-size luxury MPV category. The Odyssey Hybrid RC4 was launched in Japan on 4 February 2016.http://gas2.org/2016/02/06/honda-offers-hybrid-odyssey-minivan-in-japan/ Honda has given the Sport Hybrid i-MMD name to the new hybrid system. Improvements to the new hybrid system include reduction of the size and weight of key components such as the battery and power control unit from the existing two-motor hybrid system used in the Accord Hybrid and Accord Plug-in Hybrid that were introduced in 2013. The power control unit is 23 percent smaller and 27 percent lighter than the one in the Accord Hybrid. The Odyssey Hybrid went on sale in Japan on 5 February 2016, but is unlikely to be exported to the US as the US-market Odyssey utilizes a larger platform than the Japanese market Odyssey. In Saudi Arabia, the JDM Odyssey was introduced in 2015 as Honda Odyssey J, while Odyssey continues with its original name. The fifth generation Odyssey is also a basis for the second generation Honda Elysion for the Chinese market, but with a different front mask, and adopts a design resembling the Honda Legend. The Odyssey-based Elysion was launched in China on 9 January 2016. On 16 November 2017, the fifth generation Odyssey was given a facelift and refreshed with a range of driver‚Äôs assistances featuring adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, collision mitigation braking system, lane departure warning, road departure mitigation system, lane keeping assist system, rear cross traffic monitor and blind spot monitoring system in the top of the range model. It also has a new front mask, an improved NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) and a plusher captain's chair in the second row. A facelift of the fifth generation Honda Odyssey was introduced in the Chinese market in July 2018, updating the front end with a redesigned front bumper.

History Until the beginning of the 20th century, the coast of Canelones was a desert of dunes and marshes. Being unsuitable for agriculture, this land was considered of little value. By 1870, some of the economically powerful families of Montevideo acquired the custom of setting up summer camps in Santa Rosa Beach (the actual Mansa Beach of Atl√°ntida). They traveled in wagons that were used as home, and they transported food supplies, including chickens and dairy cows for a three-month stay. In 1908 efforts began to ameliorate the land of dunes. Pines brought from Galicia, Portugal and southern France were planted, as well as eucalyptus and acacias. From the following decade onwards, various resorts started developing along the coast, with Atl√°ntida the first and the biggest and most developed until the 1990s. The rapid growth of the rural area adjacent to the coast in the decade of the 1990s, increasingly linked to tourism, and the expansion of the metropolitan area of Montevideo have significantly changed the area.

He signed with Nashville of the Southern League in 1906, having had \\"trouble at Seattle.\\"  Umpiring career In 1908, Frary umpired in the Northwestern League. That July, it was reported as \\"practically settled\\" that Frary would be promoted to the major leagues the following year. The next month, Frary made headlines when President Charley Wolf of the Spokane club accused him of being crooked and connected to gamblers. Frary demanded that the National Board of Minor Leagues either expel Frary or Wolf. In September, Aberdeen manager Bob Brown accused Frary of drunkenness on the field. Frary remained in the Northwestern League through the 1910 season, after which he stated that he would not return to the league without a generous boost in pay. In June 1911, Frary was promoted to the National League umpiring staff. In his debut, Frary was the base umpire for a Christy Mathewson shutout against the Boston Rustlers. In July, Frary took a foul ball to the leg and blood poisoning developed. Frary was able to return to the field briefly in mid-August, but he came home within a few games when he was bothered by leg trouble again. He umpired his last NL game on August 14, 1911. Contrary to initial reports, Frary was not ultimately retained by the NL for the next season. Despite speculation that he might open a book at a local racetrack, he umpired in the Union Association in 1912 and 1913. In May 1914, Frary abruptly departed for a three-year contract in the Federal League. By 1915, however, Frary was back in the Northwestern League. In 1918, Frary ejected Salt Lake City pitcher Clarence \\"Popboy\\" Smith after an argument about which ball should be in play. After being tossed, Smith struck Frary with a punch that broke the umpire's nose. The pitcher received a suspension and $250 fine. Before the 1920 season, Frary and two other umpires were fired from the Pacific Coast League staff by new league president William H. McCarthy. Personal life Frary ran The Mecca, a Spokane saloon that served as a hangout for popular figures such as a young Jack Dempsey. The saloon was ordered closed in 1911 for harboring unsavory characters and selling liquor on Sundays. During the investigation of the saloon, Frary's wife was involved in a police chase. Mrs. Frary was wanted to testify before the commissioner's court, but she hurriedly jumped into a taxi to evade officers. Though the police car had mechanical problems, officers caught up to the cab and took Mrs. Frary into custody. Death Frary died in Aberdeen, Washington in November 1925.

It was a tactical ally of the Shimazu clan. The Sagara clan was, in the Edo period, a tozama daimy√¥ clan which ruled over Hitoyoshi han in Higo province. The domain boasted a kokudaka of 22,000 koku. The Sagara were originally descended from the Fujiwara clan, and are believed to have taken their name from the manor (sh≈çen) they held in Sagara, Haibara district, T√¥t√¥mi province during the Kamakura period. In 1198, the year before his death, Minamoto no Yoritomo granted the territory of Hitoyoshi (on Kyushu, in modern-day Kumamoto prefecture) to the Sagara. Hitoyoshi is surrounded on all sides by mountains, making it quite easily defensible, and allowing the Sagara to relatively easily survive their neighbors' attacks during the Sengoku period. Sagara Nagatsune initially fought alongside the Western Army (against Tokugawa Ieyasu) at the Battle of Sekigahara, but secretly sent an envoy to Ieyasu declaring his allegiance. When Ieyasu's forces laid siege to Nagatsune's √îgaki castle, he granted the attackers entry, thus earning him some relief from Tokugawa enmity. After contributing as well to Tokugawa efforts during the Siege of Osaka, he earned a high reputation for his clan.

Reeder served as civilian administrator of Wehrmacht occupied Belgium and northern France when Nazi Germany occupied those countries during World War II. Early life Joining the Imperial German Army straight from school, he served on various fronts during World War I. At the end of the war, he joined the University of Halle-Wittenberg in Halle, where he studied law and political science. During this period he joined the Corps Palaiomarchia and also volunteered for the local Freikorps under Major-General Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker (1865‚Äì1924). In this role, Reeder became involved from February 1919 onwards in the brutal suppression of the strikes and riots in Halle, which occurred as a result of the November Revolution, and resulted in the abdication of the monarchy in the early days of the Weimar Republic. After further study at the University of Kiel, from 1921 he was appointed a court clerk, and in 1922 a government clerk in the District government of Schleswig. From 1924 to 1929 he was an assessor in the Prussian district of Lennep, and then Cologne. NSDAP Reeder joined the NSDAP on 1 May 1933. Appointed district governor of Flensburg, two months later he was appointed district president of the government of Aachen. On 9 July 1936 Reeder was appointed governor of Cologne. In 1938, the Belgian King Leopold III (1901‚Äì1983) appointed Reeder Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold. At the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) on 31 August 1939 as a Brigadefuhrer, and given the additional governorship of D√ºsseldorf. Reeder became key in the planning of the invasion of Belgium during the Phoney War. Administrator of Belgium On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium under the operational plan Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). Once the Wehrmacht had fully occupied Belgium, Adolf Hitler chose not to install a civilian government (such as he had done in the Netherlands), but instead installed a military government headed by Alexander von Falkenhausen of the Wehrmacht. This intensified friction and disagreement between native-Belgian right-wing factions, including Verdinaso and Rexism, forcing them to fully collaborate with the occupying forces in order to gain influence. Hitler and SS-leader Heinrich Himmler profited from the situation by increasing competition between various native-Belgian groups by founding some more extreme collaborationist organisations, including the 6th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Langemarck and DeVlag, the German-Flemish Workers Community. After Ward Hermans and Ren√© Lagrou left the Flemish National Union (VNV) to form the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen,Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 179 their leader Staf de Clercq immediately chose to collaborate as well, despite pre-war statements to the contrary. Reeder was appointed head of the administrative staff of the Military Governor of Belgium and northern France under von Falkenhausen, in charge of all economic and political issues, and liaising with the occupation Government in charge. As a result, Reeder's first official business in D√ºsseldorf was to appoint his Vice President William Burandt as his interim-successor, but retained his position in Cologne. Relationship with Robert de Foy On their return to Belgium in July 1940, the Flemish-Nationalists complained to Reeder, who had De Foy arrested for the deportations. Instead of being sent to prison, De Foy was transported to Germany, initially held in a hotel in M√ºnster, before being transported to Berlin. Questioned and held for a few weeks, he was released and told to make his way back to Belgium. In the meantime, SS-Chief Reinhard Heydrich communicated directly to Reeder that de Foy was to remain in position and untouched.Deportations to Killing CentersEntre Nous / Musings of a former Belgian: From this point forward, a relationship of tension existed between de Foy and the Nazi occupying forces in Belgium. Although co-operative with them, de Foy had both his department and powers cut from this point forward, and it was not until after the Allied invasion of France and the oncoming collapse of Nazi control that the status- quo was disrupted. Arriving in Brussels on 14 August 1940, De Foy resumed his duties, but the State Security Service had been abolished, and the activities of his residual department were now limited to the policing of aliens. On 1 October 1943 de Foy succeeded Gaston Schuind as Secretary General of the Department of Justice, after he reached an agreement with Reeder that the autonomy of the Belgian justice system was guaranteed. At the same time, the Wehrmacht took over the policing of aliens in Belgium, which after this time greatly escalated. This was in part aided that from July to September 1944, Reeder was appointed Deputy of the new Imperial Commissioner for the occupied Belgium and northern areas of France, the former Cologne and Aachen Gauleiter Josef Groh√© (1902‚Äì1987). Final solution Throughout his period of administration, Reeder had co-operated with both von Falkenhausen and later Groh√©, together with the administrator of France Dr Werner Best, to try to apply the rules of the Hague Convention in their region, often against the wishes and instructions of their Wehrmacht and SS superiors. In part they were aided by an ongoing conflict between Himmler and Heydrich, which locally manifested itself as to who had what control over the still in place Belgian Police. Reeder was directly responsible for the destruction of \\"Jewish influence\\" in the Belgian economy. But to ensure that all the Belgian people co-operated in the German occupation, Reeder negotiated an agreement to allow native Belgian Jews to remain in Belgium. Part of this was the non-enforcement of the Reich Main Security Office order for all Jews to be marked by wearing a yellow Star of David at all times, until Helmut Knochen's conference in Paris on 14 March 1942. While implementation of economic policy led to mass unemployment of Belgian Jewish workers, especially in the diamond business, Reeder's efforts preserved existing national administrative structures and business relations within Belgium and northern France during the German occupation. 2,250 of these unemployed Belgian Jews were sent to forced labour camps in Northern France (still under Reeder's control), in order to build the Atlantic Wall for Organisation Todt. The one attempt at the mass deportation of Belgian Jews, attempted on 3 September 1943, proved a failure. After Wehrmacht raids, hundreds of Antwerp Jews were taken in furniture vans from their homes to Mechelen transit camp. Soon afterwards, Reeder ordered their release at the direct request of Queen Elisabeth of Bavaria and Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey, and the attempt was not repeated. It was hence reported as \\"impossible\\" by local SS units charged with meeting Final Solution targets to find enough stateless and foreign Jews to fill another Auschwitz transport after 20 September 1943, though 1,800 Jews of various privileged categories were taken in 1944 to camps including Theresienstadt and Bergen-Belsen. This meant that although 43,000 Jews left Belgium under the Final Solution up until the end of occupation in 1945, many of these in the early months of occupation, this approximated to the number of non-Belgian Jews who had been resident in Belgium before the war, according to lists compiled by de Foy. Post war, historians estimated that only 6% of Belgian Jews were arrested and sent to camps in the east; 13,000 of the non-Belgian Jews transported from the territory died. 1944 - 1945 Eggert was promoted SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer on 9 November 1943. With both the buildup of the US Army in England from 1944, and the advancement of the Soviet Red Army in the east, the Nazi occupation in the west became more focused on the final solution. After the Allied Forces invasion of Normandy in June, the Nazis relieved de Foy of his position, in part driven by the rumours that he was \\"London's man,\\" having made contact according to post-War records with the Belgian Resistance via both Walter Ganshof van der Meersch and William Ugeux. After Robert Jan Verbelen was made head of the De Vlag Veiligheidscorps, a Nazi SS security force in Belgium, and a failed attempt to execute De Foy by firing squad, he was placed in jail. As the Allies entered Belgium, De Foy was released and went into hiding. Reeder was taken prisoner on 18 April 1945 and held in Belgium until the summer of 1947. Post World War II Reeder was placed on trial in Belgium on 9 March 1951 and defended by lawyer Ernst Achenbach. Reeder and Alexander von Falkenhausen were tried for their role in the deportation of more than 30,000 Jews from Belgium, but not for their deaths in Auschwitz. Both were found guilty on 9 July 1951 and sentenced to 12 years hard labour in Germany. On return to West Germany, on 30 July 1951 they were pardoned by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and Reeder subsequently retired at his own request. It was Reeder's efforts to preserve existing national administrative structures and business relations within Belgium and northern France during the German occupation, and the delayed and incomplete efforts to inflect the Final Solution on Belgian Jews that spared Reeder and gained him enough credit to earn a pardon.

Asavas are also translated as \\"karmic predilections\\" and \\"karmic propensities\\" in Buddhism. The term is also common in Jainism literature, and sometimes appears equivalently as Asrava or Anhaya. However, Buddhism rejects the karma and asava theories of Jainism, and presents a different version instead. Etymology According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ajahn Sucitto in his book 'Kamma and the end of Kamma' describe asavas as \\"underlying biases\\" (that fabricate things, emotions, sensations, and responses), which condition grasping through which samsara operates. Meaning=Samsara The ƒÅsavas are mental defilements that perpetuate samsara, the beginningless cycle of rebirth, dukkha, and dying again. Carr and Mahalingam: Bikkhu Bodhi: De Silva further explains: The word canker suggests something that corrodes or corrupts slowly. These figurative meanings perhaps describe facets of the concept of ƒÅsava: kept long in storage, oozing out, taint, corroding, etc. Number of ƒÅsavas Some Pali canons mention three ƒÅsava that sustain karmic flow. These three mentioned in the NikƒÅyas are \\"karmic propensities for sensual pleasures (kƒÅmƒÅsava), karmic propensities for existence (bhavƒÅsava), and karmic propensities for ignorance (avijjƒÅsava)\\". Other Pali texts mention four ƒÅsava, adding di·π≠·π≠hƒÅsava or \\"karmic propensities for a viewpoint or perspective\\". In either case, these texts assert that the complete destruction of all these asavas is synonymous with complete Awakening. Liberation According to Rhys Davids & Stede (1921‚Äì25), \\"Freedom from the 'ƒÄsavas' constitutes Arahantship.\\" According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, Textual appearance Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, in his translation of the Dhammapada, notes that the word \\"asava\\" appears in the Dhammapada in verses 93, 226, 253, 292, and 293.

He was famous for his service in the Danish Royal Navy, particularly during the First Schleswig War, 1848-51. Cape Steen Bille on The King Frederick VI Coast, East Greenland, was named in his honour by W. A. Graah. Early years Influenced by his father‚Äôs role in the defence of Copenhagen in 1807, and the visits of many leading naval figures to his parents‚Äô house, he became a cadet (midshipman) in 1809 at the age of 12, and seven years later a junior lieutenant with an honorary position at the royal court. In this time he saw service in Minerva in both the Mediterranean and the Danish West Indies.Tops√∏e-Jensen Vol 1 pp 133 - 136 In 1823 he was promoted to senior lieutenant.Project Runeberg - S A Bille In French service In 1820, Bille returned from the cruise in the West Indies in the frigate Minerva and entered French service along with his older brother Lieutenant Ernst Bille (who died the following year), serving in the ship-of- the-line Colosse in Brazilian waters and on South America‚Äôs west coast where there was civil turmoil in both Chile and Peru. Returning via Rio de Janeiro (where the republic was declared while he was in harbour), he returned to France in October 1821 and to Denmark early in 1822. His maps and sailing notes on the various South American harbours and on Cape Horn were submitted to the Danish admiralty. As tensions between France and Spain heightened two years later, Bille again sailed with the French. On board l‚ÄôHermione he was in command of a division of bomb vessels at Cadiz, when the city was captured by the Duke of Angoul√™me in the Battle of Trocadero in 1823. Thereafter in Galathea to Smyrna, he continued to Greek waters where the war of independence (from Turkey) was in full swing. Here he could observe the war at close quarters, and had close personal contact with the Turkish leaders Ibrahim Kapudan Pasha and Ismail Gibraltar.\\"Barndoms-og Ungdomserindringer\\" (‚ÄúMemories of Youth and Childhood‚Äù) in Fra alle Lande (1869 to 1870) In Danish service On his return to Denmark, Bille, who was known personally by King Frederick VI, was given command of the steamship Kiel which was ‚Äùat the disposition of the king‚Äù; later as second-in-command of the brig St Thomas to the Danish West Indies and various other naval duties. While a lecturer at the Danish Naval Academy in 1828 he married Caroline B√ºlow, daughter of Frantz B√ºlow the then Chief of the Danish Army. In 1830 he was appointed Gentleman Cavalier to the Royal Princess Caroline, in 1834 promoted to commander, and in 1841 to captain. As such, Bille was second-in-command of the frigate Bellona in 1840‚Äì1841 on a voyage to South America. Events on this voyage led to an investigation of his over-severe handling of the crew, but the complaints were later withdrawn. In 1844 he was in command of the training corvette Flora when she fetched Crown Prince Frederick back from IcelandThe Danish article, and Runeberg Project, have Crown Prince Frederik returned from the Faroe Islands. Tops√∏e-Jensen has him returning from Iceland. In 1845 Bille became captain of the corvette Galathea in which he sailed round the world,Korvetten Galatheas Rejse omkring Jorden (1853) overseeing the transfer of Tranquebar and Serampore trading posts which had been sold to the British East India Company, and other trade and diplomatic duties. During the voyage part of his crew went in an Indian-built boat Ganges to the Nicobar Islands with the idea of establishing a colony there. This venture was abandoned soon afterwards on the grounds of the unhealthy climate, whereupon the British took over. Three Years' War As the fleet was put on a war footing in 1848 at the start of the First Schleswig War (which the Danes call the Three Years' War) Bille was placed as deputy commander of the Baltic squadron in Hekla helping with the transfer of troops to Schleswig and Southern Jutland and hindering enemy bombardments. After the Prussians got involved and the Danish army retreated, his squadron blockaded their harbours. No major naval engagements took place, but Fredericia ‚Äì occupied by the Germans ‚Äì was bombarded by Steen from Hekla and six gunboats. Bille‚Äôs popularity amongst the Danes rose considerably after this action. Later in 1848, a further promoted Bille was transferred to North Sea operations blockading the Weser and Elbe. In 1849, again as commander of a blockading flotilla in the North Sea, he had some small encounters with armed German steamships and had to forsake the defence of the islands to the west of Jutland until he had some Danish gunboats sent via the Limfjord to flush out the enemy. In the last year of the war, after the German Bund had agreed a peace and the fighting could be concentrated on the rebels (Shleswig Holsteiners), he was again on the east coast flying his pennant in the steamship Skimer. Again, there was little opportunity for major naval action although Bille did take part in the Battle of Mysunde near Egernfjord on 12‚Äì13 September. Bille‚Äôs naval career ended at the close of the war‚Äôs with a strong reputation for seamanship and leadership abilities, although sometimes overstrict to his subordinates. Politics In January 1852 Bille was appointed minister for the navy, which post he retained even with a change in the administration until December 1854. As Britain and France became embroiled in the Crimean War, Bille ordered some naval preparations in Denmark‚Äôs fleet ‚Äì but without parliamentary authority ‚Äì for which he was brought to impeachment proceedings but found not guilty. He represented a Copenhagen constituency in parliament, and again was given the naval portfolio from 1860 to 1863. His belief in modernising the fleet, with such unproven things as steam power, rifled naval guns and much else, invited opposition to the great expense ‚Äì especially from the Liberal Party. In 1864 Bille, now a vice admiral, travelled to China as a fully accredited representative of the state with powers to ratify the trade treaty with that nation.Min Rejse til Kina (1865) Bille retained an interest in public affairs, particularly those of the sea and the navy, often contributing forthright opinions in discussions in the press. He retired from state service in 1868 at the age of 70. Decorated with several foreign honours, and the high honour of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1857, Bille died on 2 May 1883 and was buried in the family plot in Holmens Kirkeg√•rd, Copenhagen.

Life He operated in a house in Bartholomew Close, London, later occupied by the two Jameses the typefounders. In 1725 Benjamin Franklin found work there, staying for a year, and was employed on the second edition of William Wollaston's Religion of Nature; during this period Franklin wrote A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain. On 15 February 1731 a printing-press was set up at St. James's House for the Duke of York and some of the princesses to work under Palmer's supervision. Although his business was large and successful, Palmer ultimately became bankrupt. He was ailing two years before his death, which took place on 9 May 1732. Works In March 1729 Palmer circulated a prospectus of ‚ÄòThe Practical Part of Printing, in which the Materials are fully described and all the Manual Operations explained‚Äô. But those in the trade were concerned that secrets would be disclosed, and the Earls of Pembroke and Oxford, Richard Mead, and others, persuaded him to change his plan, and write a history of printing. Several parts were actually published‚Äîabout two-thirds of the book‚Äîwhen Palmer died. Palmer's ‚ÄòHistory of Printing‚Äô was completed after his death by George Psalmanazar who in his ‚ÄòMemoirs‚Äô claimed to have written the whole book. It appeared as The General History of Printing, from its first invention in the City of Mentz to its first progress and propagation thro' the most celebrated cities in Europe, particularly its introduction, rise, and progress here in England, London, 1732. A ‚Äòremainder‚Äô edition was issued by A. Bettesworth and other booksellers with a new title in black and red, A General History of Printing from the first Invention of it in the City of Mentz, &c.;, 1733. Joseph Ames's copy of the History, with manuscript notes, was purchased by James Bindley in 1786. The second part, containing the practical part, ready for printing, was also in the possession of Ames, the author of a more successful history of English printing; it was, however, entirely derivative, being a translation of a French work by Martin-Dominique Fertel.

She was a Republican member of the Nevada Senate from November 2010 until February 2012. Halseth is the youngest woman in Nevada to ever have been elected to the Nevada Legislature. She's announced her intention to seek office in the Nevada Senate again in 2018. Early life and education Halseth was born in Oregon in 1983, where she was raised by her mother. She graduated from North Salem High School in Salem, Oregon in 2001. She moved to Nevada in 2006. She earned her psychology degree from Corban University in 2014. Career Halseth began her political career by running for the Nevada Assembly. However, at the last minute, she decided to shift her campaign goals on the Nevada Senate. Her successful campaign has been called \\"unlikely.\\" During the primary campaign, Halseth, the more conservative candidate, defeated Dennis Nolan. Halseth released a message left by Nolan on the voicemail of Jaime Anderson Lawes, previous wife of Gordon Lawes, and sister of a sixteen-year-old girl he (Lawes) was accused of raping. Gordon Lawes had been sentenced to a ten-year prison sentence, and Nolan left the message to say it would be \\"very financially beneficial\\" if Jaime would \\"tell the truth\\" about the rape. The release of this message has been blamed for the failure of Nolan's campaign, and cited as a contributing factor to Halseth's success. She then went on to defeat Benny Yerushalmi, her millionaire opponent in the general election. While a Senator, Halseth was a member of the Senate Revenue Committee, Senate Commerce, Labor and Energy Committee, and the Senate Transportation Committee. Halseth announced her resignation from office on February 17, 2012, citing issues with balancing performance of her senatorial duties with being a single mother. She also wrote in her letter of resignation that she will likely seek employment outside of Nevada due to issues with finding employment. Her resignation followed criticism that she was missing meetings and not returning telephone calls. Her then-husband Daniel Halseth was later indicted on two felony counts: one of coercion and one of battery; he was also indicted on one misdemeanor count of open and gross lewdness.  Personal life  In May 2012 after her February resignation from the Senate, Halseth appeared in Maxim's \\"Hot 100\\" photo contest appearing in a bikini.

He is commemorated in the Rokeby Chapels in two Yorkshire churches, St Oswald's Church, Kirk Sandall, and Halifax Minster.  Early life  He was born at Kirk Sandall, near Doncaster, eldest of the five sons of John Rokeby (died 1506). His younger brother Sir Richard Rokeby (died 1523) was Comptroller of the Household to Cardinal Wolsey and later Treasurer of Ireland. William retained a deep affection for Kirk Sandall and returned there to die. He went to school at Rotherham; studied at OxfordAlumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Rokebye-Ryves and became a fellow of King's Hall, later Trinity College, Cambridge. He became vicar of his home parish in 1487 and was transferred to Halifax, another town for which he had a deep attachment, in about 1499. In 1507 he was made Bishop of Meath.  Later career  On the death of Walter Fitzsimon in 1511, Rokeby became Archbishop of Dublin. He was Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1512 to 1513 and from 1516 to 1522.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges In Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Volume 1 page 155 O'Flanagan believes that he was a good and diligent Lord Chancellor, although he did not leave behind many written judgments. He was clearly a trusted servant of the Crown: in particular the Lord Deputy, Surrey, with the approval of Henry VIII, chose Rokeby in 1520 as mediator in the feud, which had become exceptionally bitter, between Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond and Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond.O'Flanagan, J. Roderick The Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870 As Archbishop he also made a reputation as a peacemaker, settling a long and bitter dispute between the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick's Cathedral. He gave permission to Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare for the original foundation of Maynooth College, which was suppressed in 1535. He was frequently at the English Court, so often in fact that he was accused of neglecting his official duties. He participated in the christening of the future Queen Mary I in 1516 and the ceremony by which Wolsey received his cardinal's hat.O'Flanagan Lives of the Lord Chancellors As Archbishop of Dublin he is best remembered for the Synod of 1518. The Synod prohibited the use of any tin chalice at Mass, and the disposal of Church property by laymen; and attempted to regulate the procedure for dealing with intestate estates, the payment of tithes and burial fees and the rules for admission to the clergy. Rather comically, Rokeby strictly forbade clergymen to play football.Lives of the Lord Chancellors- the author suggests that Rokeby thought that it was beneath the dignity of clergymen to play the game. He was appointed Archdeacon of Surrey on 27 March 1519. By 1521 his health was failing: he retired to Kirk Sandall and died there on 29 November.Ball Judges in Ireland  The Rokeby Chapels  Rokeby made elaborate provision in his will for the disposal of his remains: he asked that his body should be buried in Halifax, but that his heart should be buried in St Oswald's Church, Kirk Sandall, and that mortuary chapels be erected at both spots.O'Flanagan Lives of the Lord Chancellors The Rokeby chapels in St Oswald's and Halifax Minster still exist. Halifax Minster, where Rokeby is buried  Character  O'Flanagan praises Rokeby as a good man, a good bishop and, so far as we can tell from the scanty records, a good judge.Lives of the Lord Chancellors Elrington Ball, while acknowledging his good qualities, suggests that he was a failure as Irish Lord Chancellor, due partly to his frequent absences in England.Judges in Ireland  References  Category:Bishops of Meath Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland Category:1521 deaths Category:People from the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Archbishops of Dublin Category:Pre- Reformation bishops in Ireland ","title":"William Rokeby"},{"id":"31639798","text":"Patrick John Bradley (born 23 April 1902) was a Scottish professional football player of the 1920s.

He is mostly known for his releases on DJ Umek‚Äôs 1605 label and his entry at number 88 of the DJ Mag Top 100 poll in 2005. Besides 1605, he has released records on labels such as Toolroom, Great Stuff, Craft Music, Bedrock and many others.  Early Music Career  Christian studied and graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 2000 with a degree in Music Production and Sound Engineering. While living in Boston he started DJing, but was playing Drum & Bass. During that time he also set up his own vinyl label called First Commandment Records. A major turning point was working at the legendary Boston Beat record store, where his love for early house music was put to good use. After returning to Athens, Christian got involved in remixing for Planetworks, a seminal Greek dance label, cutting his teeth in 4/4 production. At the same time he briefly worked for a DJ booking agency in Athens. While all this was happening, Christian‚Äôs DJ tastes turned to the early dark progressive sounds of 2001 and his first gigs were warming up for luminaries such as Carl Cox, John Digweed, Sasha and many others. This led to a two-year residency at the legendary +SODA in Athens.  First productions  Now in full-on production mode, his debut track ‚ÄúIt Scares Me‚Äù was released on John Digweed's Bedrock imprint and he has since gone on to record for some of the world's most respected labels. His early remix schedule included massive reworks such as that of Anarcrusan's ‚ÄúIn My Mind‚Äù for Yoshitoshi/Shinichi. In addition to his production career he also started teaching a college-level Sound Engineering and Music Technology course in 2003, which he is still involved in today.  DJ Mag Top 100  2005 was an important year for Christian, as his touring schedule now included North and South America, Europe and Asia with gig highlights including the San Francisco Love parade and the WMC in Miami. It was this year that he broke into DJ Magazine's Top 100 DJs poll, coming in at number 88.  Devilock Records  On 06/06/06 Devilock Records was conceived and was graced by high-profile artists such as Jerome Isma-Ae, The Horrorist, Thomas Penton and other top players of the time. At the moment Devilock Records is on hiatus, as Christian's new label with Press & Play Management, Sabotage Records is now his new endeavor.  Sabotage Records  Sabotage Records is a partnership between Press & Play and Christian Cambas and the label specializes in cutting edge Techno and Tech House. Sabotage is already the home to Phunk Investigation, Kiko, Electric Rescue, Alex Di Stefano, Axel Karakasis, and many others.  1605 and beyond  Moving on to new territory, Christian's productions are now supported by a phalanx of scene-defining Techno jocks, and he is releasing tracks on labels such as UMEK's 1605, Great Stuff, Toolroom, Rusted and others. He is also involved in another secretive project, the Saboteurs, who have released on their native Sabotage and have also remixed the likes of Spektre.

J.‚Äù Smith Jr. (born February 24, 1989), is an American football coach and former linebacker who is currently the linebackers coach at the University of Missouri. He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers out of Appalachian State University in the sixth round (186th pick overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. Early years Smith attended Independence High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. Where he started for three years out of four and was part of a team that went undefeated and won four straight state titles. During his time at Independence High School he was often rotated between middle and outside linebacker. He was an all-state recognition twice, an all- conference nominee three times, and named team MVP his senior year. Smith also lettered three years in basketball. College career Smith went on to play for the Appalachian State University Mountaineers, where he led the NCAA Division I FCS in active tackles with 525 by the end of his career. He also became the first Appalachian State player since three-time NFL Pro Bowl nominee Dexter Coakley to have more than 500 tackles in his career. He majored in Business Management. 2007 Smith had an eventful first season with the Mountaineers, even though he did not hold the starting job until the seventh game of the season. Even so, he recorded more tackles than any Appalachian State freshman since Dexter Coakley in 1993, and had at least 10 tackles in five of his first nine starts. He was named the Southern Conference Defensive Player of the month for November after leading the conference in tackles with 49, interceptions with two, and passes deflected with five. His first interception was against The Citadel, which he ran back 43 yards for a touchdown. During this game, he broke the record for tackles by a freshman in a game (also held by Coakley). He was named the Southern Conference Player of the week after a game against Chattanooga after recording 14 tackles and 2 pass break-ups. In the National Championship game against the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens, he recorded 10 more tackles. 2008 Following his successful freshman year, Smith continued on as the starting linebacker and started all 14 games. His arguably best performance of his sophomore season took place against the Samford Bulldogs, a game in which he had 16 tackles (12 solo). Following this game, was once named the Southern Conference defensive player of the week. He again received this honor after a contest against the Alabama Crimson Tide. Smith finished the season with 123 tackles, including 53 solo tackles. He finished second in the conference and 12th in the nation and received second team Southern Conference honors. 2009 Smith's success at Appalachian State University continued into his junior year, a year in which he was elected a first-team All-American by the Sports Network, and all- conference by the coaches and media. He started all fourteen games of the season and tallied fourteen tackles in the opener against East Carolina University. He continued on to earn National and Southern Conference Defensive player of the week for his performance against Samford University with 17 tackles, the most by any Mountaineer since his Freshman year. He finished the season with 137 tackles (60 solo), and with two forced fumbles and recoveries, the most on the team. 2010 Continuing the streak, Smith started all 13 games in his final season as a Mountaineer and was once again named a First- team All American by the Sports Network and College Football News. He was named as a second team all-American by Phil Steele, and to the third team by the Associated Press. On top of this, he was given first team all Southern- Conference honors by the Coaches and Media. Though he did in fact start every game that season, only six of them were at weak-side linebacker (The position he had played most of his career). He was then moved to middle linebacker due to injuries. Even so, he still posted double-digit tackles in ten out of thirteen games. His first start at linebacker came against Samford, where he intercepted a pass and returned it 26 yards to set up a touchdown. In his final season, he registered a career-high 146 tackles (5th nationally), with 76 of them being solo. Professional career Smith was thought by scouts to be on the shorter side for a linebacker and stated that he \\"has trouble finding the ball inside at times due to his lack of height.\\" Scouts stated that his arms were too small and limited his ability to \\"grab NFL backs on the way through or get off blocks.\\". They also stated that he has a habit of overrunning plays. On the positive side, they stated that Smith was a \\"Thick, compact linebacker\\", who often \\"Scrapes down the line, stays square to get to the ball.\\". NFL Scouts stated that he was good at changing directions with limited space and that he was an \\"Excellent wrap-up tackler in space\\" Green Bay Packers Smith was selected by the Packers 186 overall with the second of three sixth round picks in the 2011 NFL Draft. Smith responded to being drafted by stating: \\"I'm ecstatic that Green Bay saw my talent and decided to pick me up.‚Äù Smith was released by the Packers on April 24, 2013 after he failed a physical. San Diego Chargers Smith was claimed off waivers by the San Diego Chargers on April 25, 2013. He was released before the season. Houston Texans Smith signed with the Houston Texans on November 13, 2013. Carolina Panthers Smith signed with the Carolina Panthers on January 3, 2014. Coaching career After his playing career ended, Smith accepted an offer from his former high school coach to be the defensive coordinator at Vance High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. He accepted a position at his alma mater Appalachian State in 2016 as the program's director of recruiting relations. He was reassigned to a defensive analyst position in 2017, and promoted to outside linebackers coach in 2018. Smith was named the linebackers coach at Missouri in 2020.

The people are Swampy Cree from the Rocky Cree (Asinƒ´skƒÅwiyiniwak) band government. They are in possession of a number of reserves, but population is centered at IR Norway House 17 (06392). There are over 8300 members living on-reserve with another 1900 plus members at various locations off-reserve. The 2016 Census reported an official population of 7,927 inhabitants at Norway House 17 up from 4 7,758 in 2011. The Norway House Cree Nation school is the subject of a documentary by Alanis Obomsawin. History Prior to the signing of Treaty 5, the Cree people of Norway House were requesting to enter a treaty with the government of Canada as many other Indigenous peoples had been doing down south. They were struggling to survive, running low on food, housing supplies, and medicine. On September 24, 1875, Treaty 5 was signed at the Hudson‚Äôs Bay outpost of Norway House, thereby creating the reserve of Norway House Cree Nation. A few families from Norway House Cree Nation then migrated down south to where is now Fisher River Cree Nation to establish an agricultural community. After signing Treaty 5, the government was then responsible for the education, public health, and food supplies for the community. In 1900, the Norway House Residential School was built to accommodate the educational needs of First Nations students primarily from northern Manitoba. Children experienced poor sanitation standards and learned skills pertaining to labour, such as housekeeping, sewing, and mending. In the winter of 1906/07, student Charles Clyne ran away from the school after receiving corporal punishment. Charles‚Äô feet were badly frostbitten after spending a night in a cabin in the woods, and he was then permanently disabled. The school was poorly maintained, and burnt down in 1913. Another building was built in 1915, and was then destroyed by a fire in 1946. And again, another was erected in 1954 until it closed permanently in 1967.

Cotta Elbe Sandstone () describes sandstones that naturally occur in North Bohemia and those parts of Saxony within the area around Dresden. It is named after the River Elbe, which cuts through the sandstone region in a transverse valley, the Elbe Valley Zone. It reaches the surface most strikingly in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, which are divided into the regions of Saxon Switzerland on German soil and Bohemian Switzerland on Czech territory. The term Elbe Sandstone is used in both geological and economic contexts.  Geological term  In a geological sense, Elbe Sandstone includes all sandstone types that occur in the region of the Elbe Valley and were formed during the Cretaceous period. It consists mainly of quartz grains that are cemented by silica. The ratios and constituents of its accessory minerals are variable. Its deposits border on the area of the Lusatian Massif (Lusatian anticlinal zone), the Mei√üner Massif, the gneiss of the Eastern Ore Mountains, the Elbe Valley Slate Mountains and the territory of the Czech Republic by the northeastern foothills of the Central Bohemian Uplands and the fringe of the Eger Graben.  Petrography of quarried Elbe sandstones  The bulk of the rock won in the quarries comprises sandstones with a silica cement. These are quartz sandstones, whose quartz grains have intermeshed crystal systems as a result of lithification (diagenesis) at their contact zones. Additional constituents include feldspar, glauconite and ferrous minerals of limonite ore. In the pore space of sandstones of the Cotta type there are the fine- grained minerals of illite, kaolinite and quartz. The kaolinite comes from the chemical weathering of the feldspar (kaolinization). The SiO2 thus released contributes considerably to the mutual coalescence of the grains of sand. The pore spaces in sandstones of the Posta type for the most part contain no fillings. Sandstone from Reinhardtsdorf is an ashlar of the Cotta type with several properties of the Posta type. In the past sandstone was won in a few quarries, now closed, that had a carbonate content. These sandstones came from deposits close to the surface and were only of low economic value. The most important properties of these types of ashlar are derived from the presence or absence of fine-grained constituents.Siegfried Grunert: Der Elbsandstein: Vorkommen, Verwendung, Eigenschaften. In: Geologica Saxonica Journal of Central European Geology 52/53 (2007)  Stratigraphy  Hardened sand sediments of marine origin from the Upper Cretaceous form a sequence of several strata up to 400 metres thick. They have been quarried for centuries and used as ashlars. The deepest-lying, stratigraphically oldest layer is described as Mittelquader (\\"Middle Ashlar\\") or Cotta Sandstone, was formed in the Lower Turonian and is mainly used as natural stone for stone carving. Above that lies Oberquader (\\"Upper Ashlar\\") from the Middle Turonian, which is also known as Reinhardtsdorf Sandstone. It forms the main bulk of Elbe sandstone, but has only limited use. Similar to it, but of better quality, is Grillenburg Sandstone, that does not occur in Saxon Switzerland, but at a place of this name in the Tharandt Forest near Dresden, and, like Hetzdorf Sandstone, is one of the Niedersch√∂na layers. Due to their formation within the Elbe Valley Chalk they are also counted as Elbe sandstones, though. These sandstones are no longer quarried. The uppermost, most recent layer is called √úberquader (\\"Over Ashlar\\") or Posta Sandstone and occurs, like the similar Wehlen Sandstone, only on the eastern bank of the Elbe. This variety from the Upper Turonian has a high strength and is used as a building stone, especially in a load-bearing role. It was used inter alia in the construction of the Church of Our Lady in Dresden. Similar to it are the sandstones from the Paulsdorf, H√∂ckendorf and Dippoldiswald Heaths, not far from Dippoldiswalde near Dresden.

Plot The daughter (Jacqueline Dupr√©) and wheelchair-bound brother of a dead aristocrat are placed in the care of an evil nun in a remote Spanish castle. The daughter embarks on a rampage of lust and murder after becoming possessed by the spirit of her dead mother. Cast * Jaqueline Dupr√© as Miria Aguilar * Mariangela Giordan as Sol * Aldo Sanbrell as Antonio Aguilar * Joe Davers as Isidro * Giancarlo Del Duca as Dr. Juan Suarez * Alfonso Gaita as Ignazio Aguilar * Marina Hedmann as Maria Aguilar Production For Satan's Baby Doll, Gabriele Crisanti and screenwriter Piero Regnoli opted to remake the film Malabimba ‚Äì The Malicious Whore, which included casting Mariangela Giordano in basically the same role as she had. Giordano spoke negatively on the role, stating that remaking Malabimba was \\"a stupid move. I felt used, abused and exploited.\\" It was the last film Giordano made with Crisanti, ending both their professional relationship and their personal one. Unlike Cristanti's earlier films which were hybrids of sex and horror, the target for Satan's Baby Doll was for a hardcore pornography audience. This included casting Italy's best known pornographic actress of the period Marina Hedman and Alfonso Gaita who was a regular in Italian hardcore pornography films of the period. Jacqueline Dupr√© was a stagename of an actress who Mario Bianchi stated he couldn't remember her real name, but recalled that she lived in Ostia and that this was seemingly her only film. Filming began on August 17, 1981. Aldo Sambrell was even involved in a unsimulated sex scene with Marina Hedman, which he later recalled: \\"We had to shoot a love scene, Marina and I... Well, I was lying on the bed, waiting for her, and when she showed up we started making out; after a while I realized that she was doing it for real and I had to stop her...\\" Sambrell contacted Crisanti to state he could not work under these conditions. Sambrell was replaced by Gaita for the explicit shots. Release Satan's Baby Doll was submitted to the Italian rating board in June 1982 in a softcore version which had a running time of a little over 73 minutes. The film was first released in Spain on 25 February 1983 in a softcore version titled La hija de Satanas. The Spanish version was seen by 20,230 spectators and grossed a 2019 equivalent of 30,200 Euro. It was distributed theatrically in Italy by Film 2 on 29 July 1983. Although Bianchi and Cristanti had denied a hardcore version of the film had existed, a hardcore version of the film premiered on a German DVD in 2007. The hardcore version runs at 88 minutes.

He was drafted by the Eagles in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He played college football at Cincinnati. Kelce is a Super Bowl champion, three-time Pro-Bowl selection, and three-time first-team All-Pro selection. He is the older brother of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Early life Kelce grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, the son of Ed, a sales rep in the steel business, and Donna, who works in banking. He attended Cleveland Heights High School, where he played both running back and linebacker and was twice named All-Lake Erie-Lake League. At Cleveland Heights, he played baritone saxophone in the Symphonic and Jazz Bands.http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/eagles-super- bowl-52-jason-kelce-hockey-saxaphone-football-lacrosse-20180130.html College career A former walk-on running back, Kelce switched to fullback and then finally to offensive line after redshirting his initial year at Cincinnati, seeing action at center and guard in nine games in 2007 as the Bearcats went 10-3 and defeated Southern Mississippi 31-21 in the PapaJohns.com Bowl.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/cinn/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2014-15/misc_non_event/14_fb_guide.pdf As a sophomore in 2008, he made 13 starts at left guard, as part of an offensive line that also included future NFL linemen Jeff Linkenbach and Trevor Canfield, which helped the UC offense average 27.3 points and 375.3 yards of total offense per game. The Bearcats went 11-3 overall, were Big East champions, and played in the FedEx Orange Bowl, where the Bearcats fell to Virginia Tech 20-7. His brother, Travis Kelce, began playing alongside him at Cincinnati after he also joined them in 2008. In 2009, Kelce earned second- team All-Big East honors after starting 13 games at left guard as the Bearcats went undefeated in the regular season (12-0) and were again Big East Champions, once again earning a BCS Bowl berth, losing to Florida 51-24 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. He was moved to center for his senior season in 2010 as the Bearcats went 4-8 under new coach Butch Jones. He started the final 38 games of his 47-game Bearcats' career, 26 at left guard and 12 at center. He was named Honorable Mention All-America and second team All-Big East. Professional career Despite lacking \\"true NFL size\\", Kelce was projected a fourth to fifth round pick. He ran the fastest 40-yard dash time of all offensive linemen at the 2011 NFL Scouting Combine, with a 4.89-second time. On March 11, Kelce had an appendectomy after he was diagnosed with appendicitis. Kelce was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round (191st overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. Kelce was unable to practice or sign a contract until the NFL lockout was lifted on July 25, 2011. He signed a four- year contract on July 27. New offensive line coach Howard Mudd envisioned Kelce as in the mold of Indianapolis Colts five-time Pro Bowl center Jeff Saturday, whom Mudd coached in Indianapolis for 11 seasons. First-round pick and fellow rookie Danny Watkins compared Kelce to a hedgehog due to his spiky hair and facial hair, in addition to his quickness and stoutness. Kelce battled incumbent starter Jamaal Jackson for the center job early in training camp in August. Kelce received all of the first-team reps in the week before the team's third preseason game. He started in the third preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, and allowed a sack and was penalized for holding. Despite his performance, Kelce was named the starter for the season on August 29. He became the first rookie in Eagles history to start all 16 games at center.http://media.philadelphiaeagles.com/media/149931/kelce- jason.pdf In 2012, Kelce was named the starting center for the second consecutive year. On September 16, he suffered a partially torn MCL and torn ACL in a win over the Baltimore Ravens. Kelce would miss the rest of the 2012 season. Kelce had an outstanding 2013 season, starting all 16 games and helping the team reach the playoffs. He helped the Eagles score a team-record 442 points and 6,676 yards. He led the way for the NFL's leading rusher, LeSean McCoy, who rushed for 1,607 yards. Kelce was graded by Pro Football Focus (PFF) as the best center in the NFL for the season. He was also honored with the Ed Block Courage Award. On February 27, 2014, Kelce agreed to a six- year, $37.5 million contract extension, with $13 million guaranteed, according to agent Jason Bernstein. On September 23, Kelce underwent surgery for a sports hernia and missed 4 games. Despite missing time, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl. In 2015, Kelce started in all 16 games. He was graded by Pro Football Focus as the 7th ranked center in the NFL. In 2016, Kelce started in all 16 games and was selected to his second Pro Bowl. In 2017, Kelce started in all 16 games and had his best season as a pro. He was selected as a First- team All-Pro and was the highest rated offensive lineman by PFF. He also won Run Blocker of the Year by PFF.https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro- philadelphias-jason-kelce-is-a-road-grader-and-pffs-best-run-blocker He won Super Bowl LII with the Eagles after they defeated the New England Patriots 41‚Äì33. During the Eagles' Super Bowl parade on February 8, 2018, Kelce garnered national attention after giving an impassioned speech where he defended his teammates, coaches, and front office and compared Eagles fans to hungry dogs who \\"for 52 years have been starved of this championship,\\" while famously dressed up as a mummer. On March 2, 2019, Kelce signed a one-year contract extension with the Eagles through the 2021 season. Personal life He is the older brother of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Jason played hockey in high school while brother Travis played basketball. He, along with former Eagle Beau Allen, appeared in the Super Bowl LII-themed episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, \\"Charlie's Home Alone\\", in Charlie Kelly's imagination.

She is a well- known anti-apartheid journalist and activist, exiled by South Africa and Rhodesia for her writings. She is based in the United Kingdom and Germany and writes in both English and German. Her young adult, historical fiction reflects her battles against racism in Germany and Africa. Biography Born Ruth L√∂wenthal in F√ºrth (near Nuremberg) in 1924, Ruth Weiss emigrated with her parents and sister to South Africa in 1936 to escape rising German persecution. Too poor to study at a university, she became a self-taught expert on African economics by working her way up to company secretary at South Africa Mining and General Assurance Company, one of the few females in the upper reaches of the then-male dominated insurance industry. She taught herself journalism by assisting her partner Hans Leopold Weiss, an African correspondent in the 1950s for several German papers. She was Business Editor of Newscheck, before joining the Financial Mail (FM). In 1966 she became FM's Bureau Chief in Salisbury (Harare), Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), but was declared persona non grata by the white regime because of her critical reporting and \\"sanction busting\\" stories. She moved to The Guardian in London, returning in the 1970s to Africa as Business Editor of the Times of Zambia and Zambian Financial Times correspondent. From Lusaka she moved to Cologne, Germany, as an editor in the Voice of Germany's Africa-English department, before turning freelance in London in 1978. After covering the 1979 Lancaster House talks on Zimbabwe, she was invited to Zimbabwe to train economic journalists and was co-founder of the Southern African Economist. From 1987 to 1991 she worked on the staff of the Zimbabwe Institute of Southern Africa (ZISA), which facilitated secret meetings of white and black South Africans, ahead of official talks, which began in 1990 and led to the dismantling of apartheid. Starting in 1992 she wrote on the Isle of Wight for a decade. She moved to Germany in 2002 where she continues her research and writing of historical novels on anti-racism themes. Awards In 2005, Weiss was one of 1,000 women nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the group \\"Swiss Peace Women\\", based on her long history of opposition to apartheid resulting in her exile, for her lifelong work with German and Swiss anti-apartheid groups, her work in German schools on reconciliation between herself as a Jew forced to flee Germany and the post-Nazi German generations, and finally for her work with ZISA, which helped to bring white and black South Africans together prior to the dismantling of apartheid. In 2010 a girls' high school in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, was named the Ruth Weiss School, and a library containing her works was established. Nadine Gordimer wrote a letter that was read during the ceremony, and the Laudatio was given by Denis Goldberg, the only white on the trial with Nelson Mandela who, like the others, was sentenced to life imprisonment. \\"Feresia\\" (a day in the life of a child in Zimbabwe) was listed as one of the best 20 German children's books of 1988. \\"Sascha und die 9 alten M√§nner\\" was listed by the Catholic Best Children Books 1997 in Germany.

Early years Fusco attended Seneca Valley Senior High School in Harmony, Pennsylvania, where he played offensive tackle. He did not play football until his junior year at Seneca Valley, stating \\"Sophomore year, didn‚Äôt really do nothing and football just kind of came to my attention. I always watched it on TV and I sometimes got into a ticked off mood so I wanted to get out on the field and take my frustrations out on people.\\" Despite performing for a team that won just one of eighteen contests during his two varsity seasons, Fusco earned All-WPIAL Class AAA-1 and honorable mention Quad North All-Star honors. Fusco was also an honor roll student. Fusco was not heavily recruited out of high school, mainly due to his lack of prep school experience and his 6-4, 240 lbs frame. He was only offered a chance to play football at small college schools, Youngstown State and Slippery Rock being the leading candidates. He eventually chose to enroll at Slippery Rock, stating that he felt very connected with the coaching staff. College career After enrolling at Slippery Rock in 2006, Fusco spent his freshman season as a red shirt on the scout team, where he played offensive tackle. In 2007 spring drills, Fusco shifted to center. As a sophomore, Fusco received All-American honorable mention, All Super Region I and All Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference first-team honors. He started all eleven games at center, delivering ten touchdown-resulting blocks for a unit that rushed for 29 scores. His efforts help Slippery Rock rank second in the conference with an average of 484.14 yards per game. Fusco received All- American, All-Region and All-PSAC first-team accolades as a junior. Named the team captain, he also received squad MVP honors. He led the PSAC Western Division with 98 knockdowns and eleven touchdown-resulting blocks, despite the team‚Äôs lack of a strong aerial game that ranked 59th in the nation. It was his drive blocking skills that helped the team finish fifth nationally in rushing (239.54 ypg) and seventh in total offense (456.69 ypg). He became the 19th player in school history to garner All-American first-team honors more than once in a career, as the 2010 Gene Upshaw Award winner and team captain captured All-PSAC honors for the third consecutive year. With a limited passing game, The Rock again relied on his drive blocking skills to place tenth in the Division II ranks with an average of 247.38 yards per game rushing. He capped off an excellent career by becoming the first player in school history to compete in the Senior Bowl. Professional career Along with Will Rackley, Ben Ijalana, and David Arkin, Fusco was considered one of the best small-school offensive line prospects. After a strong performance at the Senior Bowl and the NFL Combine, Fusco was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the sixth round, 172nd overall, in the 2011 NFL Draft. Minnesota Vikings Fusco played in three games of his rookie campaign. During his second season he started all 16 regular season games. On September 6, 2014, the Vikings signed Fusco to a five-year, $25 million contract extension. On February 10, 2017, Fusco was released by the Vikings. San Francisco 49ers On May 2, 2017, Fusco was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. Fusco started all 16 games for the 49ers in 2017 at right guard, and the team averaged 3.9 yards per carry on runs behind him. Atlanta Falcons On March 14, 2018, Fusco signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons. He was named the Falcons' starting right guard to start the 2018 season, beating out incumbent starter Wes Schweitzer. He started the first seven games before suffering a season-ending ankle injury in Week 7. On April 29, 2019, Fusco was released by the Falcons with a failed physical designation after one season while only playing and starting in seven games.

After province, prefecture, and county-level divisions, township-level divisions constitute the formal fourth-level administrative divisions of the PRC. However, as Beijing is a province-level municipality, the prefecture- level divisions are absent and so county-level divisions are at the second level, and township-level divisions are at the third level of administration. There are a total of 331 such divisions in Beijing, divided into 150 subdistricts, 143 towns (30 of which are areas) and 38 townships (24 of which are areas). This list is organised by the county-level divisions of the municipality.

Proposed abolition In the summer of 2005, Jan Peter Balkenende's second cabinet presented plans to renovate the broadcasting system, including abolition of the NPS by 2007. The proposal was met with fierce resistance from many viewers and listeners, given the dedicated and fairly sizeable audience for the NPS's output. The idea was that other broadcasters would take over the type of programming that the NPS had previously provided. There was little confidence among viewers, however, that this would actually happen. It was speculated at the time that the real motive for the proposed abolition was that the governing parties (Christian Democrat and liberal conservative) saw the foundation's output as being too left-wing. The plans were in the end withdrawn following the elections of November 2006.

Description This bamboo grows with an expected height to 9 m (30 ft) with a culm diameter to 5 cm (2 in). New culms are green, paling with age, with all green internodes that later develop white powdery rings at maturity. Culm sheath colors appear grey-green with burgundy or purple margins with larger sheaths sparsely strewn with small spots. Similar to Phyllostachys atrovaginata, rubbing the culms of this bamboo may release an aroma reminiscent of sandalwood. Distribution This bamboo grows in areas ranging from subtropical to temperate and tolerates winter low temperatures better than most bamboos. Its natural distribution in China is found in Zhejiang Province. Name Its common name of \\"green skin bamboo\\" or \\"Dongyang green skin bamboo\\" translates directly from the Chinese name, Dongyang being a city- level county in the central area of Zhejiang Province.

The 1974 Asian Games (officially known as the Seventh Asian Games) was a multi- sport event held in Tehran, Iran from September 1, 1974, to September 16, 1974. This was the first time that Asian Games were celebrated in any Middle East country. A total of 3,010 athletes selected from 25 Asian National Olympic Committees participated in 16 sports divided into 202 events. The number of participating countries was the greatest in Asian Games history, eighteen nations competed in Bangkok, host of the 1970 Asian Games. Fencing, gymnastics (artistic) and women's basketball were included for the first time; while sailing‚Äîwhich made its debut in the previous Asian Games‚Äîwas not included, however since 1978, sailing is a part of the Asian Games sports. The Republic of China (Taiwan) was expelled from the Games after the decision made in the Asian Games Federation's conference held on November 16, 1973, to allow the entry of the People's Republic of China. Mongolia and North Korea also entered the Games for the first time. Athletes from the Arab nations, Pakistan, China and North Korea refused to face Israel in tennis, fencing, basketball and football events, due to political reasons. Nineteen nations earned medals at the Games, and fifteen of them won at least one gold medal. Japan led the medal count for the seventh consecutive time in the Asian Games, with 75 gold and 175 overall medals. Competitors from the host nation, Iran, finished at the second spot in the medal table, the best performance of Iran since 1951, claiming 81 medals in total (including 36 gold). In its debut, China finished third with a total of 106 medals, including 33 gold. South Korea devolved to fourth position with 16 gold and 57 overall medals, South Korea ranking second in the medal table of the previous Asian Games. Medal table Esther Rot of Israel won three gold medals in athletics ‚Äì 100 m, 200 m and 100 m hurdles. The ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code. A total of 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100 kg category of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for second place in the parallel bars event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded. Changes in medal standings On September 10, 1974, Oscar State, secretary general of the International Weightlifting Federation, announced that two weightlifters‚ÄîNorth Korean Kim Joong-iI (heavyweight) and Japanese Masushi Ouchi (middle heavyweight)‚Äîhad tested positive for a banned substance (stimulant) and were stripped of their medals. Kim had won three gold medals (snatch, clean & jerk and total) in the heavyweight category, while Masashi had won two gold (snatch and total) and one silver (clean & jerk) in the middle heavyweight. Kim usually competed in the middle heavyweight category, but due to being marginally overweight, he was forced to compete in heavyweight; after his disqualification, all three gold medals of the heavyweight category went to Houshang Kargarnejad of Iran. Snatch's gold and silver of clean & jerk of Masashi went to China's Qian Yukai and gold of total to Ali Vali of Iran.

History The band's frontman, John Barrett, formed Bass Drum of Death in 2008 as a one-man-band, playing both his bass drum and guitar. Although the band's members are from Oxford, Mississippi, they quickly became unmotivated by the lack of a music scene and decided it would be best to start in New York City. The touring band consists of two guitarists and a drummer. Barrett recorded their first two albums by himself. Their debut LP, GB City, was released on April 12, 2011 by Fat Possum Records. Inflated Records also distributed the vinyl edition. In April 2011, Bass Drum of Death performed live on Fuel TV with MellowHype, of OFWGKTA, playing the song \\"64\\". Their song, \\"Get Found\\", has been aired on Triple J, an Australian alternative music radio station and the group played the station's 2012 New Beginning's Festival. In addition, Bass Drum of Death has performed at the Rock en Seine Festival in France. From the time of their inception, Bass Drum of Death has toured the United States and Europe extensively. In August 2014, the band performed in Brazil for the first time. In early 2013, the band was signed to Innovative Leisure Records. In two consecutive years, they released two full-length albums. On June 25, 2013, they released an eponymous album and, on October 7, 2014, they released Rip This, which featured drummer Len Clark as a new collaborative band member. In May 2015, John Barrett announced through the band's social media accounts, that Bass Drum of Death would be going on a hiatus citing \\"personal issues\\", canceling their scheduled summer tour of Europe in the process.

Walter Dorwin Teague designed a rounded aircraft-style body for railway cars manufactured of Cor- Ten steel. These cars weighed 15 tons less than conventional heavyweight steel cars. It was hoped these attractive lightweight cars might encourage public use of rail transportation while offering improved economy to the railway companies. New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad purchased the first of these cars in 1934. Other purchasers included Boston and Maine Railroad, Bangor and Aroostook Railroad, Kansas City Southern Railway, Seaboard Air Line Railroad, Saint Louis Southwestern Railroad, and Lehigh Valley Railroad. A. C. Gilbert Company, with New Haven trains running past their factory, decided to produce models of this car for their American Flyer toy train sets. Thousands of these toys were produced from 1946 to 1958; and railfans used the name American Flyer to describe the streamlined cars made by Osgood Bradley.

It is close to the Land Yeo river, the A370 road and the Bristol to Exeter railway line. Roman settlement Roman remains were first identified at the site in 1839 when a railway cutting was being constructed. Excavations in the 1960s showed that the site was occupied from the middle of the 1st century until at least the fifth century, demonstrated by the coins of Theodosius, Magnus Maximus and Arcadius which have been found. The full extent of the site is unclear, beyond a specific villa but there is some evidence that the site is much more extensive, possibly forming a village or even a town. It has been speculated that this may be the site of Iscalis as described by Ptolemy, however it has also been suggested this may have been at Charterhouse Roman Town. The Roman site had a wide wall around it, enclosing an area of around , although this is obscured on the southern side near the railway line, A deep well has also been uncovered. At least nineteen agricultural buildings have been identified within the enclosure. In addition one building at the southern end of the site included a colonnade and mosaic and other features suggesting it was a sizeable Roman villa. A magnetometry survey conducted during 2009 and 2010 identified several likely buildings outside the enclosed area. The site was connected to Abbots Leigh by a Roman road. Current building Gatcombe Court was built in the late 14th century, based on a solar built by John de Gatcombe before 1254. The house was further altered in the late 17th century and again in the 20th century. The two-storey house has tiled roofs with attics into two steep gables. The garden includes a yew hedge which is believed to be 400 years old and a recently added Roman herb garden designed by Jekka McVicar. Near the house is an old mill on the Land Yeo. There is evidence of a snuff mill at the site in 1769, however the current building dates from the early 19th century. By 1846 it had been converted to grind mustard, annatto and drugs, but by 1874 was a flour mill. The internal machinery is still in place and the mill has been designated as a Grade II listed building. It was the family home of the Somerset Cricketer Osbert Mordaunt and then the family of Charles Clarke, of the Bristol law firm Osborne Clarke. It is now home to Stella Clarke. In the 17th century a farmhouse was built on the site. This was altered in the 19th century.

Nickles. Pre-production of the film started in June 2010 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. John M. Bennett and Lawrence Robbins are the producers of the film. The film stars Alessandra Torresani, Ambyr Childers, Johnny Pacar, Toby Hemingway, Jonathan Keltz, Jennifer Missoni, and Christian Slater. Plot On October 21, 1994, Harlan Diehl (Luke Bonczyk) murders his family at their farmhouse and he is shot by the police, as he kills his sister. The tragedy leaves behind video footage (which he had taped) and his sister's baby, who lives. Fifteen years later in Marshall, Michigan, an ambitious high school student Julian Miller (Johnny Pacar), is tasked with completing a film assignment on forgotten local stories for journalism class. Choosing the Harlan Diehl case, though it goes against the wishes of his mother, Anne Miller (Lisa Jane Todd), he selects his girlfriend, Riley (Ambyr Childers), to be his project partner, and borrows camera equipment and archive footage from his reserved former coworker at a video store, Quinn (Toby Hemingway), who has since become a news station cataloger. He also recruits his fun-loving friends, DeeDee Baker (Jennifer Missoni), Nate (Jonathan Keltz), and Brianna Baker (Alessandra Torresani) to re-enact the murder scene, allowing him to produce a gory slasher movie. One night, Quinn watches footage from the aftermath of the tragedy, where Harlan is taken away after having been shot. Still alive, Harlan awakes as the video intercuts, leading to the spiritual possession of Quinn's body by way of video playback transmission. Besides cataloging footage, Quinn is paid by a perverted cop, Officer Frank Lyons (Christian Slater), to set up spy cameras to privately record teenage girls, using this chance to initially possess Brianna, who finds and looks into the camera. He begins to kill people, starting with a coworker at his news station. Meanwhile, Julian and Riley discover that Harlan, whose parents died when he was four, bounced around from foster home to foster home until he was adopted by the Diehls, and that he is the descendant of Louis Le Prince, the inventor of cinematography. They locate the Diehl house to record footage, in the process finding out that there was a baby in the family, omitted from the reports. At work, Julian's disabled coworker, Wylie (Daryl Mitchell), tells him about an ancient legend involving Louis Le Prince, who is believed to have invented a way to steal souls, taking the soul of his own son, Adolphe, and replacing it with his own demonic spirit simply by filming him in the motion picture, Roundhay Garden Scene. The evil spirit would then possess each child in the bloodline from father to son, from generation to generation, which explains the Diehl family case. Some time later, Nate is killed by Brianna, who has become possessed. As Frank is assigned to investigate Nate's disappearance, Quinn kills Brianna, and DeeDee is possessed by Quinn through a spy camera that she finds. Next, Quinn kidnaps Riley and kills Frank and DeeDee, while Julian asks a retired newscaster, Chris Safford (Mark Metcalf), about the Diehl case. He learns Harlan raped his adoptive sister and together they conceived a baby. Their parents planned to put the baby up for adoption in order to cover up the incident, but Harlan objected and killed them. Afterwards, the baby was adopted by Julian's police officer mother, Anne, meaning that Julian is Harlan's child. Having acquired tapes from Frank, Quinn discovers this by watching police-owned footage showing Anne taking the baby. Quinn kidnaps Julian, and restrains Julian and Riley in the Diehl home. Before Quinn can possess Julian, the electricity goes out. Quinn heads upstairs from the basement to fix the issue and buying Riley time to free herself from the restraints and rescue Julian from the other room before they flee. On their way out, they stumble across Nate's dead body. They hide until Julian's armed mother Anne arrives, suspecting trouble after trying to contact Julian. Quinn shoots her with his gun and this forces Julian and Riley out to save her. They fight Quinn, though he subdues them and prepares to use his phone to film and possess Julian, as an injured Anne, wearing armor, shoots down Quinn. The next day, Anne is hospitalized and Julian and Riley see the police report about the recent murders. Shortly after, Julian receives a video message and Quinn uses it to possess Julian.  Cast Production Playback was filmed in 2010 in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area, including Cascade and East Grand Rapids, Lowell High School, and music store The Beat Goes On. The film was distributed by Magnet Releasing.  Reception  Release  Although a theatrical release, Playback was shown in only a single cinema. Playback was declared the lowest grossing film of the 2012 year by Movieline, grossing just $264 from its one-theater release, $252 on its opening night and $12 more during its first week, after which it was pulled.

She is best known for her bestseller novel The Reconstruction, about a woman who constructs a life-sized model of the hominid Lucy for a museum diorama while trying to recreate herself. Her third novel, The Mercy Journals, written as the journals of a soldier suffering PTSD in the year 2047, won the 2016 Philip K. Dick Award for distinguished Science fiction. Early life Claudia Casper was born in Toronto, Ontario. She was her parents' only child, but she now has ten half- siblings. She says that her \\"siblings ... who often spoke no common language and three parents who couldn't be further apart on the introversion/extroversion continuum,\\" helped her develop \\"an early ability to bridge realities.\\" As a result of her diverse family, she learned German, Spanish, French and some Hebrew. Casper attended Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute in Toronto, but then transferred to SEED Alternative School, one of Toronto's first free schools, which she describes as seeming like \\"a slightly scary hotbed of creativity, drugs and sex,\\" where she learned at her own pace and chose her own curriculum. Her first job in the literary world was at the age of 16, dusting books at Coles bookstore near Yonge and Bloor in Toronto. Casper used the earnings from this job to go on a solo bike trip in Germany on a three-speed bicycle. (Cycling continues to be a large part of her life. In 2010 she participated in the first Gran Fondo ride from Vancouver to Whistler, British Columbia.) While completing her Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, where she studied under Northrop Frye, Casper worked in the circulation department at The Globe and Mail. After graduation, she applied for a copy-editing job with a Toronto publisher but failed their in-house test, so she moved to Vancouver and \\"crashed on the warehouse floor\\" of a small publisher, Pulp Press (now Arsenal Pulp Press). Stephen Osborne, co- founder of Pulp Press and founder of Geist magazine, taught Casper to typeset, and for the next ten years she made a living freelance typesetting and being a foster parent for at-risk teenagers. Personal life Inspired by Rabbi Daniel Siegel, Casper and her first husband, Bryan Wert, converted to Judaism. Over the years, she has veered toward a spiritually informed atheism, and says, \\"I don't worry about defining myself. Judaism will always be part of who I am.\\" Claudia's second husband is James Griffin, the founder and president of Vancouver Film School. They have two sons together. Works Casper first submitted her writing to Event magazine's creative non-fiction competition, where she shared first prize, and the Federation of BC Writers' short fiction competition, which she also won. With the financial support of the Canada Council for the Arts, Casper wrote her first novel, The Reconstruction, about a woman who is hired to construct a life-sized model of Lucy‚Äîthe hominid whose fossilized skeleton and footprints are humankind's link to the other primates in the evolutionary chain‚Äîwhile trying to recreate herself after separating from her husband. Casper says The Reconstruction was \\"sparked by a desire to explore what it meant to be a woman living today who is descended from Lucy.\\" After a bidding war, The Reconstruction was published in 1996 by Penguin and became a bestseller. The New York Times called it a \\"probing book,\\" and The Globe and Mail said, \\"The writing is beautiful, with passages of dazzling poetic intensity on nearly every page.\\" It was optioned for a film and published in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. While writing her second novel, The Continuation of Love by Other Means, Casper also wrote book reviews for The Globe and Mail and The Vancouver Sun. She also published two short pieces, \\"Dad's Place\\" in Geist magazine, which also appeared in Best Canadian Stories 96, edited by Douglas Glover and published by Oberon Press in 1996, and \\"Victory,\\" which appeared in Dropped Threads: What We Aren't Told alongside Margaret Atwood and Miriam Toews, edited by Carol Shields and Marjorie Anderson and published by Vintage Canada in 2001. With friend Anne Giardini, Carol Shields' daughter, Casper created the Carol Shields Labyrinth, an interactive labyrinth website that honours Shields' life. Casper's second novel, The Continuation of Love by Other Means, explores gender conflict through the relationship of a right-leaning father and left-wing daughter in Argentina during the Dirty War. It was published by Penguin in 2003 to critical acclaim (Quill & Quire called Casper a \\"brave, subtle writer\\") and short-listed for the Ethel Wilson BC Book Prize. \\"Casper's third novel, The Mercy Journals, winner of the Philip K. Dick Award, was released in Canada and the U.S. by Arsenal Pulp Press. Mary Woodbury of eco-fiction.com wrote, \\"The Mercy Journals offers a view into the near future after climate change results in a far different world than the one we know today, a world in which a Mexican border horror wall comes alive, a world in which the surreal, bizarre, and beautiful begin to triumph via character redemption and hope.\\" Christine Canfield at forewordreviews.com in a starred review wrote, \\"This complex tale puts global crises and personal crises hand in hand, and questions if morality can stay the same or must adapt.\\" Casper sees her three novels as \\"a trio about our species: evolution, reproduction and war‚Äîlight topics, every one.\\" She is currently co-writing a screenplay of The Reconstruction for a 3D feature film with French co-production partners, Jacqueline Farmer and Cyril Barba√ßon. Casper has taught writing for the Vancouver Manuscript Intensive, founded by Betsy Warland and at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, and was a faculty member at the 2016 Iceland Writers Retreat.

Education  Hugo was born 1976 in Johannesburg, South Africa. He began his career working in the film industry in Cape Town, before undertaking a two-year residency at Fabrica research centre, Treviso, Italy. Work Hugo's work is governed by an autodidactic approach to photography and a deep scepticism of the role of the photographic medium. He is one of a generation of post-Apartheid photographers that seeks to confront photography's history of representing marginalised and disempowered people. His work aims to challenge preconceptions around the representation of groups of people 'other' to the Western European norm. Hugo's first major work Looking Aside (2006) depicts portraits of people \\"whose appearance makes us look aside\\" ‚Äì the blind, people with albinism, the aged, his family and himself. Each man, woman and child poses in a sterile studio setting, under crisp light against a blank background. His Rwanda 2004: Vestiges of a Genocide (2011) was described by the Rwanda Genocide Institute as offering \\"a forensic view of some of the sites of mass execution and graves that stand as lingering memorials to the many thousands of people slaughtered.\\" Hugo's most recognized work is The Hyena & Other Men (2007), which has received a great deal of attention. Loyiso Mayga, Wandise Ngcama, Lunga White, Luyanda Mzantsi and Khungsile Mdolo after their initiation ceremony, Mthatha, 2008 His series Messina/Mussina (2007) was made in the town of Musina on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa, after Colors magazine asked Hugo to work on an AIDS story. Nollywood (2009) consists of pictures of the Nigerian film industry. For Permanent Error (2011) Hugo photographed the people and landscape of an expansive dump of obsolete technology in Ghana. There is a Place in Hell for Me and My Friends (2012) depicts Hugo's family and friends from South Africa in digitally manipulated black and white portraits that aim to explore the contradictions of racial classification based on skin colour. Kin (2014) places even greater emphasis on the photographer's family and community which Hugo describes as \\"an engagement with the failure of the South African colonial experiment and my sense of being 'colonial driftwood'.‚Äù The Journey (2014) is a series of infrared images of sleeping passengers taken on a sixteen-hour flight from Johannesburg to Atlanta. Hugo prefaces the work which was presented both as an exhibition (2014) and newspaper format publication (2015) with a reflective monologue on the way that infrared images from the first invasion during the Iraq War have shifted associations with the medium from wildlife photography to conflict zones, and how contemporary surveillance has effectively challenged notions of the privacy and ownership of one's representation. Portrait #18, South Africa, 2016 In the Spring of 2014, Hugo was commissioned by Creative Court to work in Rwanda for its \\"Rwanda 20 Years: Portraits of Reconciliation\\" project. The project was displayed in The Hague in the Atrium of The Hague City Hall for the 20th commemoration of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. A selection of the photos have also been displayed in New York at the exhibition Post-Conflict which was curated by Bradley McCallum, artist in residence for the Coalition for the International Criminal Court. The project served as the impetus for the photographic series 1994 (2017) which explores the post-revolutionary era in both South Africa and Rwanda through a series of portraits of children from both countries. Flat Noodle Soup (2016) chronicles Hugo's lengthy engagement with the city of Beijing, exploring how concerns with expressing personal identity within societal norms and pressures are universal and trans-national. After Siqueiros. Oaxaca de Ju√°rez, 2018. Archival pigment print. La Cucaracha is a 2019 body of work made during four trips to Mexico over a two-year period. The photographic series explores Hugo's perception of the flamboyant and violent environment of Mexico with overt art historical references to the nation's visual canon of precolonial customs and revolutionary ideology.  Fashion  Hugo has produced fashion photography features for various publications. These include Arena Homme Plus, Re-Edition Magazine, Document Journal, System Magazine and AnOther Man. He has also collaborated on publications with Louis Vuitton and Hood By Air.  Editorial  Hugo is a regular contributor to titles such as the New Yorker, Zeit magazine, Le Monde and The New York Time's magazine. He has written extensively about his own work and that of other photographers with his article on Garth Walker being featured in Aperture magazine, Winter, 2013. In May 2015 he was invited to guest edit the supplement DeLuxe for the Dutch newspaper NRC.nl.  Film  In 2011 Hugo collaborated with Michael Cleary, co-directing the music video for South African musician Spoek Mathambo's cover version of Joy Division's \\"She's Lost Control\\". For the video, Hugo won the Young Director Award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In 2015 he directed the music video for \\"Dirty\\", a song by controversial South African musical artists Dookoom. Personal life As of 2013, Hugo was married to film editor Tamsyn Reynolds, with whom he has two children. Publications=Publications by Hugo * Looking Aside.

The Mengelberg family has a long history of various artists and professionals.  Family members and early life  Mengelberg's parents were Johann Egidius Mengelberg and Catharina Wilhelmina Leiniger. His grandfather Egidius Mengelberg (1770‚Äì1849) was a well-known painter, as was his uncle, Otto Heinrich (1817‚Äì1890). On 18 October 1866 Mengelberg married Wilhelmina Helen Schrattenholz, and together they had sixteen children ‚Äì eight sons and eight daughters ‚Äì including the conductor Willem Mengelberg (1871‚Äì1951); some of their children died young. Mengelberg's parents were Protestant, but when he turned eighteen he converted to Catholicism, probably influenced by his interest in medieval art.Huygens Institute for Dutch History Sculptor Mengelberg  Career  Mengelberg came from a family of artists. He began his Neoclassical architecture training in Cologne under the sculptor Christoph Stephann (1797‚Äì1864). Friedrich (von) Schmidt subsequently instructed him in medieval art, especially Gothic art. He set up a studio in Cologne, managed by his younger brother Otto, but he left the studio to his brother Otto and moved to Aachen in about 1865. Mengelberg then became acquainted with the theologian and historian of ancient art Franz Johann Joseph Bock (1823‚Äì1899), who took him under his wing and further educated him in medieval art. Through Bock's mediation, Mengelberg received a commission in 1868 to construct a bishop's throne for the Roman Catholic Saint Catherine's Cathedral in Utrecht. It was so well received by the church authorities that Mengelberg was invited to settle in Utrecht to build church furniture. He moved there in 1872, and became interested in the neo-Gothic art of the Netherlands. Mengelberg helped finish the interiors of Saint Catherine's Cathedral and Willibrord Church. Mengelberg worked closely with Dutch architects Pierre Cuypers and Alfred Tepe, from whom he learnt more about artistic techniques. In 1869 he became a member of the St. Bemulphus guild founded by Gerardus Wilhelminus van Heukelum, a Utrecht group of Catholic clergy and artists working to bring back the traditions and craftmanship in religious art and architecture.Generation X ‚Äì The Legacy of Johannes Anthonius Mengelberg became the most prominent member of the guild and set up a workshop studio, a closed society of specialized artists employing Gothic principles and techniques to produce items sold to the clergy. By the late 19th century Mengelberg's studio was employing more than 30 artists, designing and building items for church interiors such as organ fronts, communion pews, pulpits, altars, confessionals, and Stations of the Cross. By the end of the 19th century there were many workshops producing church art, and competition between them was often intense. But Mengelberg was confident that his studio could always produce quality items equal to or better than his competitors, supported by a fairly clear artistic doctrine in his studio and the artists' dedication. After his death the studio continued under the control of two of his sons, Joseph and Hans. Mengelberg's collection of art works was sold after his death by Jan Herman van Heek, a descendant of the well-known van Heek textile family. It formed the core of the Huis Bergh's art collection.

The works, which include parks, restaurants, riverside settings and factories, mark a breakthrough in van Gogh's artistic development. In the Netherlands his work was shaped by great Dutch masters as well as Anton Mauve a Dutch realist painter who was a leading member of the Hague School and a significant early influence on his cousin-in- law van Gogh. In Paris van Gogh was exposed to and influenced by Impressionism, Symbolism, Pointillism, and Japanese woodblock print genres. During van Gogh's first twelve months in Paris he absorbed a lot of information about modern art from the best of the avant-garde artists of the time, but in practice his work in 1886 and early 1887 varied little from his paintings in the Netherlands. In the early 1887 he stayed with √âmile Bernard and his parents in Asni√®res and the budding spring seemed to trigger an awakening within van Gogh where he experimented with the genres to develop his personal style. In a country setting, undergoing industrialization, van Gogh was able to depict his reverence for rural life and express concern about encroachment of industrialization. With new techniques, van Gogh produced paintings evoked tenderness of couples taking a walk in the park or social commentary about the ways in which factories affected country life. Background=Paris In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands for Paris never to return. His brother Theo, a successful Parisian art dealer, provided Vincent the support and connections for an immersion in modern art. In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters, as well as his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve, a Dutch realist painter who was a leading member of the Hague School and a significant early influence. Starting March 1886 van Gogh studied with Fernand Cormon. During that time he lived with his brother Theo, who leased a large apartment on Rue Lepic in Montmartre with space for a studio for Vincent. Three months later van Gogh abandoned his studies with Cormon, but his education continued as he met local artists. During 1886 he was introduced to Impressionist artists and their works, such as Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. In 1887 Van Gogh continued to make important connections with other artists who he befriended and exchanged paintings with, such as Louis Anquetin, √âmile Bernard, Armand Guillaumin, Lucien Pissarro and Signac. Having been introduced to Impressionism and Pointillism in Paris, van Gogh began experimenting with related techniques, first on a series of self-portraits before he moved on to larger, more complex compositions. Many of the Impressionist artists also shared his interest in Japanese wood block prints. The works of ukiyo-e artists, Hiroshige and Hokusai greatly influenced van Gogh, both for the beautiful subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors, without shadow. Van Gogh arranged an exhibit in Paris of Japanese prints at Caf√© du Tambourin. In the two years, from 1886 through 1888, van Gogh emerged as a sophisticated, thoughtful and provoking artist. It is through association with artists in Paris that he began to dream of a utopian artists community where \\"like-minded\\" individuals would realize \\"the perfect art.\\" Asni√®res-sur- Seine Asni√®res (pronounced /a-nee-air/), now named Asni√®res-sur-Seine, a town in the northern suburbs of Paris located on the banks of the Seine and near the fortifications of Paris. In the 19th century Parisians took a short train ride to Asni√®res for boating, including rowing meets; festivals; and the \\"unrestrained atmosphere\\" of its dances. The Goncourt brothers [Edmond and Jules de Goncourt] wrote of Asnieres in their 1867 novel Manette Salomon. Anatole, a painter, meets up with his friends near a riverside cabaret, and they all got into his boat \\"comrades of both sexes, approximations of painters, species of artists, vague women known only by nicknames, actresses from Grenelle, unemployed lorettes [women supported by their lovers], all tempted by the idea of the day in the country and a drink of claret in a cabaret.\\" Impressionists were interested in painting this area, en plein air (English: in the open), for the interesting scenery: bridges over the Seine, boats along the banks of the river, outdoor caf√©s and treed settings. Longing for tranquil settings, van Gogh began to paint in Asni√®res in April 1887 where fellow artists Signac and Bernard lived. Beyond the city fortifications and along the banks of the Seine, lay Asni√®res and the island of Grand Jatte. He experimented with a lighter, more colorful palette than used in his early Dutch and Montmartre paintings. When painting with Bernard, they often painted in the open air. To his sister Wil, Vincent wrote, \\"While painting at Asni√®res, I saw more colors than I have ever seen before.\\" Instead of working in the somber colors of his early work, he embraced the use of color and light of the Impressionists. Also influenced by Pointillism, van Gogh modified his traditional style and used vivid color, shorter brushstrokes and perspective to engage the viewer. His views of the banks of the Seine are an important progression for his later landscape paintings. In Asni√®res, within walking distance of Theo's flat in Montmartre, Vincent painted parks, caf√©s, restaurants and the river. Signac commented on meeting up with van Gogh, \\"I would encounter him at Asni√®res and at Saint-Ouen. We painted together on the riverbanks, we lunched at roadside cafes and we returned by foot to Paris via the Avenues of Saint-Ouen and Clichy. Van Gogh, wearing the blue overalls of a zinc worker, would have little dots of color painted on his shirtsleeves. Striking quite close to me, he would be yelling, gesticulating and brandishing a large size-thirty, freshly painted canvas; in this fashion he would manage to polychrome both himself and the passers-by.\\" Paintings=Parks Van Gogh's work in his first year in Paris retained much of the somber attitude and colors of his paintings from the Netherlands. During the spring of 1887 he stayed with √âmile Bernard at Bernard's parents home in Asni√®res. During that time van Gogh began to incorporate the influences he had been exposed to over the past year. His work lightened in \\"sun-drenched studies\\". Landscapes began to dominate his subject matter, painted in \\"the glory of summer and the rich colors of the vegetation\\". He now caught the sunlight between the leaves. =Lane in Voyer d'Argenson Park at Asni√®res= Lane in Voyer d'Argenson Park at Asni√®res is believed to decorate the wall in another Van Gogh painting, Interior of a Restaurant (F342). =Couples in the Voyer d'Argenson Park at Asni√®res= Van Gogh's painting Couples in the Voyer d'Argenson Park at Asni√®res (F314) was referred to by the artist as \\"the painting of the garden with sweethearts.\\" The title at the Van Gogh Museum is Garden with courting couples: Square Saint-Pierre, 1887. The summer park scene, one of his largest canvases, was one of the first paintings that van Gogh exhibited in Paris. Here he integrated what he had learned of Impressionism and Pointillism into his own version of Pointillism. He used a combination of carefully placed small dots and more expressive dashes, like those in the sky, of varying color placed side by side into what is considered his most pointillistic painting. Van Gogh used Divisionism techniques to paint woven fabrics, such as the couple in an Asni√®res park who share an interlocking pattern in their woven clothes. He collected yarn in different colors and tones to test color contrasts, just as Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul had when he developed his theory on complementary color. The Van Gogh Museum claims that the painting was made in or near Montmartre which about 7 kilometers from Asni√®res.

It was made during a period where he explored the use of \\"dots\\" of paint set alongside contrasting colors, influenced by Georges Seurat, who introduced Pointillism. In 1885 Seurat made A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte and used a technique of placing colored dots on a work which led a movement called \\"Neo- Impressionism\\", or \\"Divisionism\\" and \\"Pointillism\\". Van Gogh was one of the artists later called \\"Post-Impressionists\\" who was influenced by Seurat's style that rejected realism and idealism to create a new genre based upon abstraction and simplicity. Van Gogh learned from Seurat the beauty in simplicity and a means to convey messages in a more optimistic, light way than was his work in the Netherlands. While he could not match Seurat's precision, aspects of Pointillism were integrated into van Gogh's work. =Bank of the Seine= In Bank of the Seine (F293) van Gogh uses Pointillism in the small dots for the trees, larger dots in the sky and dashes for water. Impressionism is harnessed to create light and reflection of the water. =Bridges across the Seine at Asni√®res= Bridges across the Seine at Asni√®res (F301) was painted in open air and bright sunlight. The scene depicts railway bridges over the river. Van Gogh uses light and reflection effectively in this painting. The stone piers of the bridge are reflected in the water and white paint is used for highlights. A woman dressed in pink with a red parasol are the focal point of the composition. The painting is part of a group of suburban landscapes along with a painting in Oxford, both of which Van Gogh had placed in red frames. Van Gogh found this setting through his friend √âmile Bernard whom he met when studying with Cormon. Over the two years that Van Gogh was in Paris [1886‚Äî1887] he made several paintings of bridges crossing the Seine. =Bridge of Asni√®res= Van Gogh wrote of making Bridges of Asni√®res (F303), \\"I've been worried by the sunset with figures and a bridge that I spoke of to Bernard. The bad weather prevented me working on the spot and I‚Äôve completely ruined it trying to finish it at home. However I began again at once, the same subject on another canvas, but as the weather was quite different, in grey tones and without figures.\\" =Walk Along the Banks of the Seine Near Asni√®res= Walk Along the Banks of the Seine Near Asni√®res also called Riverbank at Asni√®res (F299) illustrates van Gogh's technique of using \\"short, rapid strokes of color the capture the atmosphere of a particular place\\", something he used with other paintings along the Seine.

Impressionists like Renoir preferred to show the moods and scenes of the interior of restaurants, while van Gogh often depicts exteriors, such as this painting. He uses vivid colors, yet also brought brightness to the painting with white paint, to depict a summer day. In the foreground three men sit at a table, one of whom is wearing a blue shirt and yellow straw hat, that Paul Signac finds is suggestive of the artist himself. √âmile Bernard is believed to be referring to The Restaurant de la Sir√®ne at Asni√®res when he recounted to Vollard that some of the van Gogh's Paris works featured \\"smart restaurants decorated with colored awnings and oleanders\\". =Exterior of a Restaurant at Asni√®res= The building's purpose in Exterior of a Restaurant at Asni√®res (F321) is suggested by the open door, potted plants and outdoor table. The painting portrays a mid-summer day, there is no shade and the colors of the painting are warm summer colors. The planter brims with flowering oleander blossoms. Both the composition and color scheme are simple, the key colors are yellow in the wall and paving and green in the shutters and plants. The motif was first inspired by a Parisian restaurant with a row of six planters filled with shrubs against a yellow wall with green shutters. The colors and shutters were used again in Vincent's House in Arles (The Yellow House) that he made in Arles in 1888.

Victor Hugo wrote a passage added to the 1861 edition of Les Mis√©rables: > \\"To wander in a kind of reverie, to take a stroll as they call it, is a good > way for a philosopher to spend his time: particularly in that kind of > bastard countryside, somewhat ugly but bizarre, made up of two different > natures, which surrounds certain great cities, notably Paris. To observe the > banlieue is to observe an amphibian. End of trees, beginning of roofs, end > of grass, beginning of paving stones, end of ploughed fields, beginning of > shops, the end of the beaten track, the beginning of passions, the end of > the murmur or things divine, the beginning of the noise of humankinds ‚Äì all > this holds an extraordinary interest. And, thus, in these unattractive > places, forever marked by the passer-by with the epithet sad, the > promenades, apparently aimless, of the dreamer. To van Gogh, industrialization meant loss of a revered lifestyle, the simple life of the peasant. Paul van der Grijp, author of Art and Exoticism: An Anthropology of the Yearning for Authenticity, wrote of van Gogh's intention to portray his message of concern, \\"In his representations of the city he mainly paid attention to the expanding outskirts which swallowed up the countryside, whereby city and country life were often juxtaposed, sometimes in the form of trains for factories blotting the countryside.\\" Van Gogh's painting Outskirts of Paris (F264) illustrates the looming encroachment of factories to the countryside. =Factories at Asni√®res Seen from the Quai de Clichy= Factories at Asni√®res is a modern landscape depicting industrial growth as it takes over rural plains, a phenomenon called by some \\"banlieue\\" or \\"terrain vague\\". A fence demarcates the line between the flowing rural field and emission-generating industrial complex. Van Gogh has used horizontal bands to deliberately depict the earthy hues and movement of the field in contrast to the solid, carefully drawn geometric shapes of the factories and chimneys. The painting seems to illustrate a line from one of van Gogh's favorite novels, L'Assommoir by √âmile Zola: \\"a great forest of factory chimneys\\" filled the sky. The topic had been picked up by Impressionists, such as Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet and Armand Guillaumin, but van Gogh may have been most intrigued by a work he saw at the 1886 Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants by Charles Angrand entitled Terrains Vagues. Based upon the provenance for Factories at Asni√®res Seen from the Quai de Clichy (F317), the work was part of P√®re Tanguy's collection until 1894. Julien (P√®re) Tanguy sold art supplies and was an art dealer who took paintings as payment for paints, which √âmile Bernard said made entering his shop in Montmartre, full of Impressionist paintings, like \\"visiting a museum\\". When Tanguy died in 1894, his friends staged an auction for his widow. =Factory at Asni√®res= Van Gogh was identified as one of the first, with other Impressionist and post- Impressionist painters, to depict industrial landscapes such as The Factory at Asni√®res (F318) Armand Guillaumin's Sunset at Ivry made in 1873 is another example.

While in exile in Trieste and Bessarabia, Tomo wrote, Umotvorine (Proverbs) and Istorija Slavenskog Primorja (History of the Slavic Littoral).  Origin and early life  Tomo ƒêurov Milinoviƒá was born in Morinj in the Bay of Kotor, at the time part of the Republic of Venice (today Kotor municipality, Montenegro). He learned how to read and write from a deacon in Morinj, and that was all of the schooling he received throughout his life. At a young age, in order to make a living and help out his family, he became a sailor like most of the men from this region. For more than ten years he served on different merchant ships, locally and around Europe. During these voyages he managed to save money and gain trading knowledge so he decided to settle down and become a merchant in Trieste. Considering that there was a number of merchants from Boka Kotorska living in Trieste, as well as other connections he established through his sailing years, he found his place quickly in that environment and became quite successful in his business. He even managed to financially help the planning of the First Serbian Uprising through friendship and connections he had with Dositej Obradoviƒá and other Serbian patriots that either lived there or visited Trieste.  First Serbian Uprising  \\"Death of Hajduk-Veljko\\", depicting the Battle of Negotin (1813) and \\"To≈°a's Cannon\\". In 1809, after the third occupation of Trieste by French during Napoleonic wars, most of Tomo's possession had been overtaken. Just around that time The First Serbian Uprising was getting more successful and also more popular between the Serbian people that lived abroad, so Tomo decided to leave Trieste with his wife and son and join the uprising. After arriving to Serbia he had been accepted by Karaƒëorƒëe to be his advisor and artillery specialist since he already had some artillery experience while sailing on armed merchant vessels. After the Treaty of Bucharest was reached between Russians and Ottomans, few of the Russian gunsmiths assigned to Karaƒëorƒëe by Russian Military left Serbia. Tomo offered himself to take over the job which Karaƒëorƒëe gladly accepted. In 1813 Tomo created two cannons of the same size consisting of five pieces each weighing 35 kilograms which made them extremely useful because of the mobility. That same year Tomo was sent to defend Deligrad as a Head of Artillery, where the Serbian army, consisting of 30,000 troops defeated the Turkish army consisting of 55,000 troops. Under his command Artillery made a great effort in this battle by good positioning and frequent relocation of the cannons which caught the opposing army unprepared in multiple occasions.  Exile  After the failure of the uprising, Tomo moved back to Trieste where he stayed until 1815. On Karaƒëorƒëe's recommendation he moved to the Russian Empire, to the town of Akkerman in Bessarabia. While in exile Tomo wrote two books, Umotvorine (published posthumously in 1847) and Istorija Slavenskog Primorja. The former was reprinted in 2004 by a relative, Jeremije Milinoviƒá, while the latter was lost and was never published.  Death  Tomo Milinoviƒá died in exile in 1846, without being aware of that fact one of his great friends Sima Milutinoviƒá made efforts and got approval from the Serbian government at the time to bring Tomo back to Serbia, which was Tomo's great wish, but unfortunately, it was too late.

Only one was built, the prototype crashing after a year's development. Design and development The SIPA S.300 was claimed by its manufacturer to be the first jet aircraft designed from scratch as an ab initio trainer, though it had a possible alternative role as a liaison aircraft. It was an all-metal low wing monoplane, with a wing sharing outer panels with the slightly earlier S.200 Minijet. The square tipped wing was straight edged, with slight sweep on the leading edge but none on the rear. Flaps stretched from the ailerons to the wing root on the trailing edge and there were hydraulically driven air brakes of the circular plate type. Pupil and instructor sat in tandem under a fully glazed, continuous but multiframed canopy, each with their own sideways opening access. The rear cockpit was placed between two small, overwing air intakes for the 1.57 kN (350 lbf) Turbomeca Palas turbojet, the exhaust from which exited ventrally well behind the trailing edge. Aft of the exhaust the underside of the fuselage tapered upwards to the tail. The tapered tailplane was placed on top of the fuselage and carried horn balanced elevators; the fin, with a dorsal fillet and balanced rudder were straight tapered, with the latter running down between the elevators to the keel. Operational history The S.300 made its first flight on 4 October 1954 piloted by Max Fischl. SIPA displayed F-WGVR at the Paris air show in June 1955, at which time it was undergoing official testing at the Centrre d'Essais en Vol. On 26 September 1955 it was destroyed following a spin; no more were built. The S.300 had been designed to allow the installation of more powerful Turbomeca engines such as the 2.14 kN (480 lbf) Super Palas, 3.53 kN (795 lbf) Aspin II or 3.92 kN (880 lbf) Marbor√© II but these plans were abandoned with the loss of the prototype.

Kennedy on 12 September 1953. The dress is one of the best- remembered bridal gowns of all time. The gown was the creation of African- American fashion designer Ann Lowe, who never received credit for it during her lifetime. Instead, when asked who made her dress, Jacqueline Kennedy said it was a \\"colored woman.\\" Design Janet Lee Bouvier, Jacqueline's mother, hired Lowe to design and make the entire bridal party's outfits. (Lowe had made Bouvier's dress for her wedding to Hugh Auchincloss.) The bridal gown, of ivory-colored silk taffeta, featured a portrait neckline and huge round skirt. The skirt featured interwoven tucking bands and tiny wax flowers. Jacqueline's lace veil had belonged to her grandmother; a lace-and-orange-blossom tiara tied the veil to her hair. Her bridal bouquet was made of white and pink gardenias and orchids. Jacqueline wore little jewelry with the dress, but what she did wear had personal significance. The single-strand pearl necklace was a family heirloom; she also wore a diamond pin from her parents and diamond bracelet from her groom, John F. Kennedy. Dress Nearly Lost A flood in Lowe's Lexington Avenue workshop 10 days before the wedding ruined the bride's gown and nine of the bridal-party's dresses. The designer and her staff worked through eight days (the original time was eight weeks) to reconstruct the gowns and get them delivered on time. Instead of an estimated $700 profit, Lowe lost $2,200 on the project. Reception The dress was crafted in a very traditional design (particularly the skirt), per the wishes of the Kennedy family; it won worldwide acclaim. However, Jacqueline had wanted a simple dress, with firm lines, to complement her tall, slim figure. She later told friends privately that she didn't like the dress' portrait neckline because, she felt, it emphasized her small bust. She also said that, in her opinion, the skirt looked \\"like a lampshade.\\" References Category:1950s fashion Category:Wedding dresses Category:Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ","title":"Wedding dress of Jacqueline Bouvier"},{"id":"31640746","text":"Proteam may refer to: * Proteam Motorsport, an Italian auto racing team. * Proteam, a former Swedish educational company, acquired by Vittra. * UCI ProTeam, a type of cycling team licensed to compete on the UCI World Tour ","title":"Proteam"},{"id":"31640782","text":"Carlton Leach is an author, occasional actor, and a former criminal.

In 2015, Carlton Leach worked with Ricci Harnet to organise another movie about his life, Reign of the General but, after losing a legal battle over copyright, the film was taken over by the owners of Rise of the Footsoldier 1 and released. The same people went on to make Part 3 of the franchise in 2017. Leach claimed to have no part in this movie and commented on Twitter that it was fictional and no longer his story.

They comprise over 2400 bee species belonging to the five taxonomic tribes Augochlorini, Thrinchostomini, Caenohalictini, Sphecodini, and Halictini, which some entomologists alternatively organize into the two tribes Augochlorini and Halictini. The subfamily Halictinae also belongs to the hymenopteran monophyletic clade Aculeata, whose members are characterized by the possession of a modified ovipositor in the form of a venomous sting for predator and prey defense. Including all eusocial and cleptoparasitic Halictidae taxa, these small bees are pollen feeders who mass provision their young and exhibit a broad spectrum of behavioral social polymorphies, ranging from solitary nesting to obligate eusociality. Estimated from the fossil record, eusociality in this subfamily evolved about 20 to 22 million years ago, which is relatively recent in comparison with other inferred eusociality origins. Thus, the Halictinae are believed to model the primitive eusociality of advanced eusocial hymenopterans. Because of their polymorphic sociality and recently evolved eusociality, the Halictinae are valuable to the study of social evolution. Tribes=Augochlorini Augochloropsis metallica male The roughly 250 species belonging to the tribe Augochlorini exist only in the New World, mainly inhabiting the Neotropics and some areas of North America. Augochlorini sociality, though not well understood, is significantly polymorphic across its range, as well as between and within species and genera. Facultative eusociality has been observed in genera such as Augochloropsis and Megalopta, and cleptoparasitism has recently developed separately in the three augochlorine genera and subgenera Temnosoma, Megalopta (Noctoraptor), and Megammation (Cleptommation). Thrinchostomini The two genera Thrinchostoma and Parathrincostoma comprise the tribe Thrinchostomini. These insects are large, nonmetallic bees residing in Madagascar and the African and Asia tropics. Twelve of the 56 Thrinchostoma species are native to Madagascar and exhibit some host-plant specificity. Parathrincostoma species, two of which are native to Madagascar, are likely cleptoparasites, indicated by a lack of pollen-collecting structures in their female morphology. Though evidence of sociality and nesting biology is limited, observed populations in southern Africa are believed to be solitary. Caenohalictini Species of the tribe Caenohalictini inhabit areas in only the New World and are similar in physical appearance to Augochlorini. Caenohalictine species practice either solitary or communal nesting. Some genera are nocturnal. Sphecodini The tribe Sphecodini contains four cleptoparasitic genera of bees that oviposit their eggs onto or near the pollen stores of their hosts‚Äô nests. These cleptoparasitic bees are host generalists and belong to an ancient lineage of parasites that uniquely shares no specificity with any nonparasitic halictine taxa. Species belonging to the largest genus, Sphecodes, exhibit especially aggressive parasitism, attacking and sometimes killing solitary or social nest host female(s) before ovipositing eggs into pollen-provisioned host cells. Such parasites inhabit every continent with the exception of Australia. Some taxonomists regard it as part of the tribe Halictini. Lasioglossum bee on mountain mint Halictini Assigned more than 2000 described species, the Halictini are the largest tribe of halictid bees, including considerable behavioral diversity. Lasioglossum, Mexalictus, and Patellapis sensu lato are notable genera. Most species belong to the genus Lasioglossum, which encompasses a variety of nocturnal and diurnal, socially parasitic, solitary, eusocial, and communal bees. Lasioglossum species are distinguished by a weakened outer wing venation, while species of Mexalictus resemble Lasioglossum in body shape, but possess strong wing venation. Mexalictus includes six described species of rare bees observed in humid areas of high elevation ranging from southeast Arizona to northern Guatemala. The social behavior of Mexalictus species is unknown. Recent observational data of Patellapis s. l. suggest the genus practices communal nesting, with as many as eight females sharing a nest. Most Patellapis s. l. species inhabit southern Africa and Madagascar, though species are also found in tropical Asia and northern Australia. Social diversity A great diversity of social systems exists between and within halictine species. These discrepancies in social phenologies occur both locally and across geographic locations. The variety of colony organizations expressed by halictine species is represented along a gradient ranging from solitary nesting to obligate eusociality. Eusociality Female Halictus scabiosae guarding the entrance of the nest Eusocial behavior is associated with cooperative nesting and brood care, an overlap in adult generations, and a division of social roles, marked by intracolony reproductive hierarchies. The social roles of a eusocial colony are distributed into castes that include the reproductive queen(s), female workers which forage for pollen and care for the brood and nest, and brood composed of potential workers and reproductive males and gyne. In the Halictinae, one or more females found a colony site, and initiate its development, first producing brood of workers to forage for resources and care for future offspring followed by brood of males and gynes to mate and propagate the nest's genes. A mated gyne is a potential queen that will either disperse to a new nest, succeed to the position of the former nest queen, or suffer subordination or harm by the current queen. In a mating season, a eusocial halictine queen usually lays multiple broods, with earlier broods composed of dominantly female workers and later broods of reproductive males and gynes. A eusocial queen monopolizes the reproductive capacity within a nest, preventing reproduction of colony workers. Overlapping of adult generations importantly enables worker daughters to contribute to the rearing of later broods. However, eusociality also exists within generations with no adult overlap. As a result of the heavy work load requirement of nest building and repeated food provisioning in eusocial colonies, nest sharing also saves time, energy, and natural resources. When multiple females found a colony, a dominant queen can subordinate another foundress. However, such foundresses may remain in the colony, likely because of the potential to succeed to the queen caste if the current queen dies or loses her position. Also, subordinate females may find an opportunity to lay their own eggs in the nest. The large colony size of eusocial insects elicits both costs and benefits. Increased group size is often correlated with increased predator attraction. However, in appropriate situations, aggregations of individuals can provide more effective predator defense. Under situations of low parasite and predator threat as well as plentiful territory and resource availability, the risk of attracting a predator from aggregating is greater than the possible benefits of collaborative nesting and reproductive rearing. When parasite and predator threats are high and territory and resources are limited, a greater number of individual workers may improve parental care of offspring. For example, increased numbers of workers in a colony increase the effectiveness of nest defenses such as stinging enemies and blocking nest entrances. Possession of venomous stinger in the Halictinae were likely beneficial in the subfamily's evolution of eusociality by providing a thwart to the increased predator attention caused by group living. Also a benefit of cooperative nesting, the requirement for foraging away from the nest does not necessitate temporary nest abandonment when a surplus of females are available to stay behind in the nest, reducing risks of brood predation. Solitary nesting In solitary nesting, a single reproductive female mates, lays and independently cares for her personal brood of reproductive males and females. Young females mature and then disperse away from the colony to establish their own nest and mate. Solitary nests less easily attract predator and parasite attention. However, they must independently forage for pollen provisions and protect their nest and brood. Obligate eusociality Obligate eusociality describes species that exhibit eusociality across all local, geographic, and temporal populations. Such species are known to exist within seven halictine genera: Halictus (Halictus), Halictus (Seladonia), Lasioglossum (Evylaeus), Lasioglossum (Dialictus), Augochlora, Augochlorella, Augochloropsis. Though eusociality is always expressed, obligately eusocial species still exhibit social diversity in degrees of eusociality. Facultative eusociality Facultative eusociality, also known as facultative solitary, describes species or populations in which both solitary and eusocial behavior are expressed. Eusociality evolved independently from multiple lineages of solitary Hymenoptera. However, some facultative eusocial species demonstrate a reversion from eusociality back to solitary nesting. Communal nesting Communal nesting, also known as egalitarian eusociality, is less common than eusocial nesting. Bees exhibiting communal nesting share a common nest or nest component, as in eusocial nest. However, each female in a communal nest cares for and raises her brood independently. Communal nesting may demonstrate an intermediate behavior in reversions from eusocial to solitary societies, suggested by the species Halictus sexcinctus, which can show solitary, communal, or eusocial behavior. It was previously thought that communal nesting actually acted as a transitional step to eusociality, but because the fact that communal and eusocial strategies exist separately in H. sexcinctus does not support this theory. Phylogenetic data from this species suggests that communal behavior may actually serve as a transitional step between eusociality and an evolutionary reversion back to solitary nesting. Perennial eusociality Lasioglossum marginatum is the only species known to exhibit perennial eusociality. This species‚Äô colonies produce a single brood of workers for three to four years and then produce a brood of males and gynes in its final breeding season. Before the end of the breeding season, males disperse to gyne-producing nests to mate. Males introduced into nonfinal-year nests mate with workers, and workers disperse to found new nests. Queens are the same size as workers, but experience a lifespan of four to five years, while workers live one year. Evolution of eusociality To hypothesize origins and losses of social behavior in halictine species, phylogenies of social taxa are critical. Phylogenies constructed from fossil evidence dating demonstrate numerous reversions within the Halictidae to solitary nesting. Morphological data were employed in the 1960s to create a phylogeny suggesting the behavioral reversion from eusociality to solitary nesting in the genera Augochlora and Augochlorella. In mapping other taxonomic relationships, however, morphological data have been troublesome. DNA sequence-based phylogenies have been the most enlightening of halictine relationships. The most recent molecular evidence suggests three to four independent origins of eusociality and frequent reversions from eusociality to solitary nesting. Determinants of sociality=Queen-worker roles and reproductive skew Eusocial queens have large bodies, are nest foundresses, monopolize nest oviposition, and raise brood with the help of less or non- reproductive female workers. These workers are daughters of the queen, have small bodies, help raise younger nest brood primarily produced by the queen. Workers are capable of laying gyne or male eggs and occasionally do so, limited by the queen's physical control. A queen can direct the evolution and maintenance of nonreproductive castes of offspring through parental manipulation with the use of pheromones or assertion of behavioral dominance. Queens can establish dominance by striking workers with her head, blocking workers‚Äô travel through nest passageways, and coaxing workers more deeply into the nest. A queen's successful reproductive monopolization is contingent on her ability to control the colony's workers and on the size of the worker population. An excess of workers may be unmanageable for a queen and lead to worker reproduction. When a queen is responsible for the majority of the offspring her nest produces, her nest exhibits a high reproductive skew between the queen and worker castes. A low reproductive skew occurs when a nest possesses little deviation between queen and worker reproductive success. Strong eusociality is measured by a high reproductive skew, and the influence of various factors on this skew determines a colony's expressed sociality. Environmental factors Latitudinal, altitudinal, and local variation have been partially ascribed to environmental influences such as flowering season length, temperature, nesting substrate availability, and risk of predation or parasitism. For eusociality to be expressed, the summer breeding season must provide time for consecutive production of both worker and reproductive broods. Thus, obligately eusocial species are restricted to environments characterized by long breeding seasons. Communal and solitary species are usually limited to short breeding seasons, and facultative eusocial species are represented in more various environments. In warmer climates with longer breeding seasons, colonies have longer cycles and are larger in size, requiring the queen(s) to interact with more worker members. This result explains latitudinal gradients of obligate eusociality in Halictus ligatus, Halictus rubicundus, and Lasioglossum malachurum. These species exhibit, to some extent, as the colony size increases, queens‚Äô ability to control their workers and monopolize colony reproduction decreases, reducing the reproductive skew and degree of eusociality. However, in L. malachrum, this trend is only observed in northern populations. In Europe, northern colonies of L. malachurum produce a single worker brood, followed by a gyne brood. However, southern European colonies produce more broods as a result of longer breeding seasons. Queens in these colonies rarely survive to the final, gyne- producing broods, increasing worker mating potential and decreasing queen monopolization of a reproduction in a mating season. A study of L. malachurum in southern Greece demonstrated the local populations‚Äô degree of eusociality varied among colonies and years, a possible result of queen survival differences during breeding seasons. Additionally, the study revealed the colony social organization of L. malachurum to vary geographically. In comparison to those in northern Greece, southern Greek populations exhibited larger colony sizes, increased ovarian development, decreased worker mating, and a smaller number of worker-sized queens. Behavioral plasticity Contributing to the vast halictine social diversity, adult female halictines possess the capacity to express any reproductive role their species exhibits and can adjust their social behavior in response to behavioral interactions within their nest and environmental conditions. The degree of this social plasticity differs among halictine species and populations, further contributing to the subfamily's great inter- and intraspecific variation. Megalopta genalis, a facultative eusocial halictine, has been observed to primarily exhibit solitary nesting while possessing the capacity for cohabitation and social dominance. These eusocial behaviors are expressed in response to changes in local environments. Reversions to solitary behavior in some facultative eusocial halictine species are associated with environmental conditions that cause removal of worker broods from eusocial colonies. Within some local populations, eusocial nests and reversions to solitary nests coexist, possibly reflecting an individual queen's control of colony adaptation to environmental conditions through her decision of brood types produced. Genetics Halictus rubicundus In combination with environmental conditions, a halictine population's genetic make-up influences its expressed sociality. An individual halictine bee's repertoire of accessible social behaviors is determined by its specific genetic make-up. The phylogeographic distribution of Halictus rubicundus, a socially polymorphic halictine, supports the importance of genetics in expressed sociality. Within its range, H. rubicundus eusocial populations exist in areas with typically longer growing seasons, while solitary populations inhabit areas with shorter growing seasons. This geographical distribution suggests social determination by environmental factors. However, DNA sequence-based phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic structure across H. rubicundus populations. Social and solitary H. rubicundus populations in North America belong to distinct evolutionary lineages, and some populations are more closely related to populations with which they share social behavior than to geographically nearer populations. Ultimately, a halictine colony's social organization is influenced by the interaction between its members‚Äô genotype, social plasticity, intracolony relationships, and environmental conditions. The mechanisms by which these factors interact in Halictinae are not currently well understood. However, the vastness of halictine social diversity, within and between species, provides ample opportunities for study.

The film is based on the 1935 Sacha Guitry film Good Luck, and stars Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers marking their only film together, and Rogers' eleventh and final film written by Allan Scott. Plot Portrait painter and caricaturist David Grant (Ronald Colman), newly arrived in Greenwich Village, wishes Jean Newton (Ginger Rogers) good luck on a whim as they pass on the sidewalk. When Jean delivers books, a woman makes her the gift of an expensive dress. She is quarreling with her son-in-law, who had given the dress to his wife. Believing David to be lucky, Jean asks him to partner with her on a ticket for the Irish Sweepstakes. He agrees only on condition that, if their horse wins, she accompany him on a platonic trip to see the sights before she settles down to married life in Poughkeepsie, New York. She and her fianc√©, Frederick \\"Freddie\\" Harper (Jack Carson), are dubious about the proposition, but he talks them into it. When their $2.50 ticket is one of the few that draw a horse, its value shoots up. Freddie wants to sell it, but the other two decide to try for the jackpot. Their horse does not even place, but Freddie informs Jean afterward that he sold their half for $6000. Outraged at his duplicity, she offers half the money to David. He only accepts provided she keep their bargain. Once again, he gets her to go against her better judgment. They drive to Niagara Falls in a new car David has bought in Jean's name. Freddie, suspicious of David's intentions, follows them there. Even though he finds they have separate (though adjoining) hotel rooms and have registered as brother and sister, Freddie is not appeased. Meanwhile, when David and Jean go dancing, they attract the attention of the Sylvesters, an older couple celebrating their 50th anniversary. They persuade the couple to accompany them to their favorite spot, making David pick Jean up and carry her across a footbridge. On the other side, David kisses Jean. Later, realizing things have gone far beyond what he had intended, David checks out and drives off in the car. He is stopped by a policeman and, when he admits the car is not his, taken to jail. Jean becomes furious when she realizes he has gone. Then, she and Freddie are also picked up by the police. They are brought before a judge (Harry Davenport), and David is forced to admit under oath that he is really Paul Knight Somerset, a celebrated painter who disappeared three years ago after being imprisoned for drawing what was then deemed indecent illustrations for a book (now considered a classic). The court reporters seize upon the story, and the courtroom is packed with the elite of society. Both Jean and David act as their own counsels. By questioning himself on the witness stand, David reveals he is genuinely in love with Jean, and the two are reconciled.

The New York Times noted that screen stories, \\"like wines, are not always good travelers\\" in that they can suffer when plot and story is adapted from one language and country to another. They wrote that Lucky Partners \\"is distinctly not one of those occasions.\\" In furthering their comparison to wine, they wrote \\"RKO's craftsmen have preserved its bouquet intact‚Äîand the result is a comedy that is dry and sparkling and bubbles till the last drop.\\" They wrote that the film \\"retained the impudent charm and rippling wit of the very Gallic Mr. Guitry\\", and others reasons for its success are because Allan Scott and John Van Druten treated the script \\"as neatly as even Mr. Guitry could demand\\" and that director Lewis Milestone \\"has punctuated the scenes deftly and never allowed the effervescence to escape in a single explosive laugh\\".

He felt that the film had a \\"ridiculous premise\\" that \\"in the right, deft hands could turn into charming, captivating trifle.\\" His opinion was that the right hands did not exist \\"in either the directing or the writing.\\" He felt that the writers did not seem to agree on what sort of story to tell, and that as a result \\"the film switches gears rather too often and its parts don't fit together.\\" He felt though, that even Colman, Rogers, and Carson did decent work, writing \\"Colman and Rogers don't have a great deal of chemistry, but they have panache and know-how to spare, and Carson, along with reliable Spring Byington, make the most of what they have.

The planet is approximately eight times the mass of Earth, and orbits its star every two and a half days at a distance of 0.0287 AU. The planet was the first to be discovered by a group of astronomers searching for exoplanets in the orbit of very-low-mass stars after the team reorganized their strategy, choosing to search for targets that they could also confirm using the transit method. However, a transit event associated with Gliese 3634 b was not detected. The planet's discovery was published in Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011. Characteristics= Mass, radius and temperature  Gliese 3634 b is estimated to be 8.4 times the mass of Earth, or 0.02 times the mass of Jupiter. Based on its mass, a radius of around 1.75 is possible. It has an equilibrium temperature of . Host star Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, meaning that it is small, emits reddish light, and has a relatively low temperature for a star. The star is 0.45 times the mass of and 0.43 times the radius of the Sun. Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, meaning that it radiates about 2% of the amount of energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial analysis of the data suggests that a secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's. The star was first catalogued in 1987, and was referenced on no more than five other occasions between its discovery and that of Gliese 3634 b. It was included in the preliminary edition of the 3rd Gliese‚ÄìJahrei√ü catalogue, which documents stars within twenty parsecs of Earth. Gliese 3634 has an apparent magnitude of 11.95. It cannot be seen with the naked eye.  Orbit  The planet has a very short orbital period, and circles its host star every 2.64561 days at a distance of 0.0287 AU. Gliese 3634 b has an eccentricity of 0.08, giving it a mostly circular orbit. In comparison, planet Mercury lies 0.387 AU from the Sun, orbits every 87.97 days, and has an orbital eccentricity of 0.2056. Discovery Gliese 3634 b was one of a sample of over 300 very-low-mass stars targeted by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth. The search for Gliese 3634 b started with a single exposure taken with HARPS on March 25, 2009. The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for a planet search using the radial velocity method (in which the gravitational pull of a planet on its star is measured by observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated the existence of a planet. Having discovered the planet, the astronomers worked to discover a transit event using the Infrared Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as ground- based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet. While the observations did not suggest that Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few orbital parameters were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements. The discovery of Gliese 3634 b was reported in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011. Gliese 3634 b was the first planet discovered by the astronomers after adopting their new strategy, despite their failure to find a transit event for the planet.

In the coming decades these difficulties grew and saw France gradually taking Spain's place as Europe's leading power through the later half of the century. Many different factors, including the decentralized political nature of Spain, inefficient taxation, a succession of weak kings, power struggles in the Spanish court and a tendency to focus on the American colonies instead of Spain's domestic economy, all contributed to the decline of the Habsburg rule of Spain.John Lynch, The Hispanic world in crisis and change, 1598-1700. Oxford, UK ; Cambridge, Mass., USA : Blackwell, 1992. The end of the 17th century also brought the end of Habsburg rule. The 18th century began with the War of the Spanish Succession, which concluded in the establishment of the Bourbon dynasty in Spain. Background: Spain from 1469 to the reign of Philip II of Spain In 1469, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile united the Crowns of Aragon and Castile into one, creating the early modern Spanish state. Although this ensured future Spanish rulers would rule over both Aragon and Castile, both regions had their own administration and legal systems. In addition, Aragon itself was divided into Aragon proper, Valencia, and Catalonia - each with its own institutions, customs, and regional identity. As Ferdinand and Isabella both outlived their only son to survive infancy, they were succeeded by their grandson, Charles I upon Ferdinand's death in 1516. Being Flemish born and not a native Spanish speaker, Charles never completely assimilated into Spanish society and as Holy Roman Emperor, had to rule over two empires at once. Determining it to be too difficult for one person to rule over all of his domains, Charles gave the Holy Roman Empire to his younger brother and the Spanish Empire to son, Philip II. Although the Spanish Empire was at the height of its power under Philip II, a number of factors foreshadowed its eventual, gradual decline. There was a revolt in the Netherlands which started in 1568 and lasted the rest of Philip's reign. Also, the moriscos in Andalusia rebelled in 1570 against Philip's imposition of Spanish language and customs on them. Philip was at war with the Dutch republic, France and England during the last 10 years of his reign. These and other wars and difficulties in maintaining the vast Spanish Empire led to four bankruptcies during Philip's reign. Reign of Philip III of Spain (1598‚Äì1621) Philip III of Spain Signs that Habsburg Spain was declining became visible during the reign of Philip III. Throughout Philip III's reign the main currency was a copper-based coin called vellon, which was minted in response to the fall in imports of silver. Ironically, the copper needed to make vellon was purchased in Amsterdam with silver. Imports of silver bullion from the Americas fell by half during Philip III's reign. In 1599, a year after Philip took the throne, a bubonic plague killed about half a million people (1/10 of the Spanish population at the time). Reign of Philip IV of Spain (1621‚Äì1665) Philip IV of Spain Philip IV's father passed on a kingdom in decline already.Suzanne Hiles Burkholder, \\"Philip IV of Spain\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 4, p. 394. New York: Charles Scriberner's Sons 1996.John Lynch, Spain Under the Hapsburgs, 2nd edition. vol 2, esp. pp. 62-228. Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1981. Philip IV of Spain was not competent enough to give the kind of clear direction that Spain needed. Responsibility passed to aristocratic advisers. Gaspar de Guzm√°n, count-duke of Olivares,J.H. Elliott, The Count-Duke of Olivares: the Statesman in an Age of Decline. New Haven: Yale University Press 1986. attempted and failed to establish the centralized administration that his contemporary, Cardinal Richelieu, had introduced in France.J.H. Elliott, J. H. Richelieu and Olivares. Cambridge [England]; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Under the immense pressures of the Thirty Years' War, Olivares attempted to bureaucratically centralise administration and to extract further taxes via the Union of Arms: Catalonia revolted and was virtually annexed by France.J.H. Elliott, The revolt of the Catalans, a study in the decline of Spain, 1598-1640. Cambridge [Eng.] University Press, 1963. Portugal reasserted its independence in 1640, with the Restoration War sparked by a Braganza claimant to the Spanish throne; and an attempt was made to separate Andalusia from Spain. Spanish forces recovered Naples and most of Catalonia from French control but Portugal was lost permanently. In 1648, at the Peace of Westphalia, Spain assented to the emperor's accommodation with the German Protestants, and in 1654 it recognized the independence of the northern Netherlands. Reign of Charles II of Spain (1665‚Äì1700) During the long regency for Charles II, the last of the Spanish Habsburgs, validos milked Spain's treasury, and Spain's government operated principally as a dispenser of patronage. Plague, famine, floods, drought, and renewed war with France wasted the country. The Peace of the Pyrenees (1659) had ended fifty years of warfare with France which had achieved some minor territorial gains at the expense of the Spanish Crown. As part of the peace settlement, the Spanish infanta Maria Teresa, had become the wife of Louis XIV. However, Louis XIV, found the temptation to exploit a weakened Spain too great. Using Spain's failure to pay her dowry as a pretext, Louis instigated the War of Devolution (1667‚Äì68) to acquire the Spanish Netherlands in lieu of the dowry. Most of the European powers were ultimately involved in the wars that Louis fought in the Netherlands. Spanish society during the 17th century Spanish society in the 17th century Habsburg Spain was extremely inegalitarian. The nobility, being wealthier than ordinary people, also had the privilege of being exempt from taxes, which the lower classes did not have. Spanish society associated social status with leisure and thus work was undignified for nobles. Even wealthy merchants invested in land, titles and juros. Two acceptable careers for the nobility were the church and education. In 1620, there were 100,000 Spaniards in the clergy, by the late 17th century there were 150,000. Many Spaniards spent long years in universities, taking advantage of the increase in the number of universities. By 1660, there were about 200,000 Spaniards in the clergy and the Church owned 20% of all the land in Spain. Economic situation in Spain during the 17th century Commentators in Spain known as arbitristas proposed a number of measures to reverse the decline of the Spanish economy but they had little effect. Aristocractic contempt for trade was reinforced by its association with conversos and moriscos who were distrusted by the Spanish general population because of their Jewish or Muslim background. More importantly, many arbitristas believed that the influx of silver from the American mines was the cause of inflation which hurt Spanish manufactures. A European price revolution was first fed by silver from central Europe, but then by that from the Spanish American mines. Spain's increasing dependence on resources from the New World over the last century reduced incentives to develop or stimulate domestic production and to create a more efficient tax bureaucracy. Instead, operating expenses were covered by borrowing funds, like the Asiento de Negros. This was unsustainable, and Spanish kings were forced to declare sovereign defaults nine times between 1557 and 1666. Another prominent internal factor was the Spanish economy's dependence on the export of luxurious Merino wool, the demand of which was replaced by cheaper textiles from England and the Netherlands. A reliance on revenue from resources obtained from the New World and Merino wool was not sustainable, and ultimately the economy stagnated. Further reading * Brown, Jonathan and J.H.

The film stars Kitty Zhang, Leon Jay Williams and Daniel Wu with action choreography by Yuen Cheung-yan. (Edison Chen was originally the lead actor but due to his 2008 photo scandal, he was replaced by Williams.) Plot Phoenix is a young peasant who dreams of becoming a dance star in the big city. One day, a previous resident of the town comes and offers ten slots at his factory to those interested. Phoenix wins one, but she gives it to her best friend Snow instead. They leave their town and travel to Shanghai. Snow takes a job in garment factory. Phoenix accidentally gets a job there, too. She sneaks out at night and takes another job as a janitor in a dance studio so she can learn enough to be in a hip hop street dance competition. After running into her several times, the owner of the studio helps her take dance classes. Eventually, he (Ron Chan) begins to drop his playboy exterior and takes her out to dinner. One day though, Phoenix catches him saying cruel things about her on the phone, although he tells her its just publicity. Suspicious, she follows him to the airport and sees him meeting a woman there. Phoenix flees back to her home, leaving Ron and Snow confused about where she went. In her village, Phoenix realizes that she has to follow her dreams no matter what and returns to Shanghai in time for the dance competition. She steps in when one of the dancers sprains her ankle. Despite Phoenix's great dancing, the team loses to the Korean team, South City Crew. All her friends showed up to the competition though, and they reunite joyfully despite losing. A surprise addition to the party is the woman from the airport, who turns out to be Ron's sister. Phoenix and Ron make up and end up together again. During the credits, Phoenix and her friends are seen returning to the village and teaching everyone to dance to hip hop. Even the scarecrow is dressed in hip-hop clothing.

Early life George Gibb was born in Aberdeen, the son of engineer Alexander Gibb (1804-1867) and the former Margaret Smith and grandson of civil engineer John Gibb (1776-1850). Gibb attended Aberdeen Grammar School and the University of Aberdeen before taking a law degree at the University of London. After spending time working in shipping and marine insurance, he was articled to a solicitor in 1872. He worked in the solicitor's office of the Great Western Railway for three years from 1877 to 1880 before setting up his own practice in London. In 1881, he married Dorothea Garrett Smith. The couple had four sons and one daughter. Transport administrator In 1882, Gibb joined the North Eastern Railway (NER) as a solicitor and was soon acting as assistant to general manager Henry Tennant. In 1891, he succeeded Tennant as general manager, taking charge at a difficult time for the railway industry. The railway companies were facing twin pressures from parliament passing legislation to control transport rates and working hours and from expanding trade unions. Gibb improved the running of the NER by introducing new management methods and recruiting able apprentice managers directly from universities and business. Among those he recruited were future transport industry leaders Ralph Wedgewood, Eric Geddes and Frank Pick. At the start of the 20th century he visited the United States to study American transport management methods and restructured the NER's organisation. He established a statistics office to collect data on the all of the company's operations. The greatly increased efficiencies that this provided enabled the company to improve its income and led to its methods being copied by many other railway companies. Gibb was also innovative in his dealings with the unions; introducing collective bargaining into his negotiations and using independent arbitration to settle disputes. In 1906, he became managing director and deputy chairman of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), holding company of four underground lines in the capital. The UERL was struggling under a heavy burden of debt incurred to construct three of the lines and electrify the fourth. With income significantly lower than expected, the UERL was close to bankruptcy. Working under chairman Edgar Speyer and recruiting future chairman Albert Stanley from America as general manager, Gibb helped reorganise the group of companies and stave off bankruptcy. In 1910, Gibb retired from the UERL to become chairman of the government's new Road Board, tasked with improving Britain's road system. The appointment of a railway specialist as chairman was controversial and Gibb was criticised for allocating 90 per cent of the Road Board's funds to the improvement of existing roads rather than the construction of new arterial roads, a move seen as delaying competition for the railways, although the delay was to allow research into road building methods. The Road Board was abolished in 1919 when the Ministry of Transport was created. Between 1919 and 1922 he acted as a consultant to the NER, advising the company on the coming amalgamation of Britain's railways under the Grouping Act. Gibb died at his home in Wimbledon. Other activities In 1901, Gibb served on the committee that considered the reorganisation of the War Office and was a member of the Royal Commission on London Traffic from 1903 to 1905. For the latter service he was granted a knighthood in 1904. During the First World War, he served on the Army council and was a member of the Government Arbitration Board Committee on Production from 1915 to 1918. At the end of his life he was briefly chairman of the Oriental Telephone Company.

Origins In mid-1973, with the encouragement of the U.S. Naval attach√© in Phnom Penh, Lieutenant commander Richard Marcinko, the MNK Fleet Command decided to raise its own special warfare unit, the Cambodian SEALs.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 258. An initial group of 24 recruits was drawn from an existing Combat Swimmer Unit (French: Nageurs de Combat)Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 17. and from the Cambodian Marine Corps, being sent to the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado at San Diego, California in the United States and to Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines to attend basic courses manned by U.S. Navy SEAL instructors from the Amphibious Group 1, the forward-based operational arm of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Force in the Pacific.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 258. At Coronado and Subic Bay, the Cambodian inductees underwent five weeks of basic Underwater Demolitions/SEAL training, which included Commando operations, reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering, jungle warfare, light weapons and demolitions; upon returning to Cambodia after completing their instruction cycle, they went to form the core of the new unit and provided the training cadre for a SEAL course, which was established at Chrui Chhangwar Naval Base. Initial progress was rapid and by the first quarter of 1974, the Cambodian SEALs aligned 40 men in three 'Commando' teams, mostly filled by selected volunteers transferred from the Cambodian Marine Corps and trained in-country, although another group of 23 Navy and Marine inductees was later sent to Subic Bay to receive ten weeks of SEAL training during the second half of that year.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 258. Parachute courses were conducted at the FANK Airborne Training Centre co-located at the Pochentong dual military/civilian international airport,Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 258. while the Olympic pool located near the National Stadium at the C√©rcle Sportive complex in Phnom Penh was used for diving courses.Khmer Architecture ToursConboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 18. Structure and organization Headquartered at the Chrui Chhangwar Naval Base opposite Phnom Penh and closely modelled after the U.S. Navy SEALs, the unit fielded by mid-1974 a total of 90 'Commandos' divided according to the SEALs practice into three teams led by Chief Petty Officer (French: Premier Ma√Ætre) Set Chan,Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 258. who reported directly for operational orders to the MNK Chief of Naval Operations, Commodore (later, Rear Admiral) Vong Sarendy. They were structured as follows: *SEAL Team 1 was allocated in Phnom Penh, where it served both as Headquarters (HQ) for the MNK Amphibious Operations Command (French: Commandement des op√©rations amphibies) and training cadre for the basic SEAL course. It was also tasked of monitoring the security of naval facilities in the Cambodian capital and carried out counter-insurgency operations along the lower Mekong- Bassac Rivers corridors. *SEAL Team 2, also stationed at Phnom Penh, was frequently deployed on the lower Mekong. *SEAL Team 3, based at the Ream Naval Base, was given responsibility for operations around the port city of Kompong Som and along the Cambodian coastline. Operations 1973-75 The Cambodian SEALs provided valuable intelligence for the MNK while acting as reconnaissance teams along the banks of the Mekong and as shock troops on amphibious assault operations.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 18; 24. During the Battle of Kampong Cham in September 1973 the newly-constituted Cambodian SEALs spearheaded Operation \\"Castor 21\\", a successful combined amphibious assault by the Marines and the Cambodian Army's 80th Infantry Brigade, launched by the MNK Fleet Command to retake the Khmer Rouge-held half of the provincial capital of Kampong Cham.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970‚Äì1975 (2011), p. 124.Cambodia Navy - History at GlobalSecurity.org, Accessed 24 Nov 2013 The Cambodian SEALs resumed the same role again in March 1974, during the MNK's second large-scale amphibious assault, Operation \\"Castor 50\\", to retake Oudong, the capital of Oudong Meanchey Province from the Khmer Rouge.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970‚Äì75 (1989), pp. 9; 24.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970‚Äì1975 (2011), p. 242. They defended the Chrui Chhangwar Naval Base until the final days of the war. Weapons and equipment The weaponry and equipment employed by the Cambodian Navy SEALs was basically FANK standard issue, being mostly of US origin supplemented by captured Soviet or Chinese weapons drawn from enemy stocks seized in the course of their operations. * FN GP35 Pistols * Colt.45 M1911A1 Pistols * Smith & Wesson Model 39 Pistols * TT-33 Pistols * Type 56 assault rifle * Type 56-1 Assault rifle * AKM Assault rifle * M16A1 Assault rifle * CAR-15 Assault carbine * Ithaca Model 37 pump-action shotguns * RPD Light machine gun * Type 56 Light machine gun * M1918A2 BAR Light machine gun * M60 machine gun * RPG-2 Rocket-propelled grenade * RPG-7 Rocket-propelled grenade * M72 LAW Anti-tank rocket launcher * M79 grenade launcherRottman, US Grenade Launchers ‚Äì M79, M203, and M320 (2017), p. 20. * M203 grenade launcher  See also  * Cambodian Civil War * Cambodian Marine Corps * Khmer National Armed Forces * Khmer Special Forces * United States Navy SEALs * Vong Sarendy * 911 Special Forces NotesReferences *Kenneth Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975, Equinox Publishing (Asia) Pte Ltd, Djakarta 2011. *Kenneth Conboy, Kenneth Bowra, and Mike Chappell, The War in Cambodia 1970-75, Men-at-arms series 209, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces, Elite series 33, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1991.

Battle After receiving the submission of Harran and Edessa, Mongol leader Hulagu Khan crossed the Euphrates, sacked Manbij and placed Aleppo under siege. He was supported by forces of Bohemond VI of Antioch and Hethum I of Armenia. For six days the city was under siege. Assisted by catapults and mangonels, Mongol, Armenian and Frankish forces overran the entire city, except for the citadel which held out until 25 February and was demolished following its capitulation.Turnbull, Stephen R., Genghis Khan and the Mongol conquests, 1190-1400, (Taylor & Francis, 2005), 60. The ensuing massacre, that lasted six days, was methodical and thorough, in which nearly all Muslims and Jews were killed, though most of the women and children were sold into slavery.Kagay, Donald J. and L. J. Andrew Villalon, Crusaders, condottieri, and cannon, (BRILL, 2003), 137. Also included in the destruction, was the burning of the Great Mosque of Aleppo. Aftermath Following the siege, Hulagu had some of Hethum's troops executed for burning the mosque, Some sources state Bohemond VI of Antioch (leader of the Franks) personally saw to the mosque's destruction.Asbridge, Thomas S., The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land, (HarperCollins, 2010), 616. Later, Hulagu Khan returned castles and districts to Hethum which had been taken by the Ayyubids.

Origins The BCP had its origins in a 60-man contingent sent by the ANK Command in March 1972 to Indonesia to attend the Para-Commando course at the Batujajar Airborne Commando School, near Bandung in West Java.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 15. A significant number of the contingent was made of recruits drawn from the Muslim Cham ethnic minority of Cambodia. After a nine-month course conducted by Indonesian Kopassus instructors, the contingent returned to Phnom Penh in November 1972. Upon their return, however, two dozen of its members were posted to the ANK's 5th Infantry Brigade, a predominantly Muslim formation; the remaining 36 Cham graduates were assigned to a ceremonial unit allocated in the Cambodian Capital until 1974. Operations They were then used as the cadre for the BCP and in March 1975, loosely under assignment to the Khmer Special Forces, the Para-Commandos were sent to man the defensive perimeter north-west of Phnom Penh.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 17; 46.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 15.

According to the book The Three Paradoxes: Working Women in Singapore written by Jean Lee S.K., Kathleen Campbell, and Audrey Chia, there are \\"three paradoxes\\" confronting and challenging the career women of Singapore. Firstly, Singapore's society expects women to become creative and prolific corporate workers who are also expected to play the role of traditional women in the household, particularly as wife and mother. Secondly, Singaporean women are confronted by the \\"conflict between work and family\\" resulting from their becoming members of the working population. Thirdly, Singapore's female managers are still fewer in number despite of their rising educational level and attainments when compared to male managers. Women's rights in Singapore Until 2007, marital rape was not legally recognized. In 2007, marital rape was recognized under certain circumstances that signaled marriage breakdown. A committee called for the repeal of any kind of marital rape immunity on 9 September 2018. Marital rape has since been criminalised under the Criminal Law Reform Act passed on 6 May 2019. The laws came into force on 1 January 2020. Proposed White Paper on women and equality On 20 September 2020, a virtual dialogue session involving more than 100 participants from youth and women organizations was held. Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam announced an initiative that will start in October which will include a series of engagements between the public and private sectors, as well as non-governmental organizations. The aim is to identify and tackle issues concerning women in Singapore. These will culminate in a White Paper to be issued by the Government in the first half of next year, which will consolidate feedback and recommendations during the sessions, to be called ‚ÄúConversations on Women Development‚Äù. Business and politics At present, there is a low presence of female participants in the political arena of Singapore. Females constitute 42% of Singapore's workforce, however, a large portion of this number occupy low-level and low-salary positions. According to the 2011 article Women's Rights Situation in Singapore, these discrepancies can be mainly attributed not to gender discrimination or gender inequality but instead to the women's lower educational qualifications and fewer job experiences than men, the women's focus and dedication to their role in family life, and the paternalistic character and Confucian temperament of Singaporean society. In relation to entrepreneurship, in 1997 Bloomberg Busineweek stated that businesswomen in Singapore can be grouped into two main categories: the entrepreneur woman who was already able to establish and raise a family, and the businesswoman who sought a substitute to the conventional \\"career path\\". An example of a successful Singaporean businesswoman was Catherine Lam, who established the company known as Fabristeel, a manufacturer of steel carts. Before launching Fabristeel in 1979, Lam worked as an accountant for 10 years. Women in Singapore who ventured into running businesses were motivated by \\"better education, the labor shortage\\", the encouragement to achieve entrepreneurial success, and the resulting \\"flexible lifestyle\\" while doing business-related roles. Another example is Lim Soo Hoon, who was Singapore's Woman of the Year in 1997. Lim was the first female Permanent Secretary of Singapore who worked for the Public Service Division of the office of the Prime Minister of Singapore. Lim held positions at Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry, then later into jobs in Singapore's Ministry of Transport, and then in the Ministry of Manpower, and Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports. Sexuality fashion and modelling industry With regard to sexuality, BBC News reported in 2001 that Singaporean women have a more open attitude about sexual intimacy in Asia. The study reflected that 18% of the Singaporean women interviewed are \\"most likely to initiate\\" sexual activity with their personal and intimate partners. This is usually met with mixed opinion, as in the case of the example in 2009 when Dr Eng Kai Er walked through Holland Village naked with Swedish exchange student Jan Phillip and was fined S$2,000 with a warning issued by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research which sponsored her undergraduate studies. During the 2000s, 2-3 out of every 10 unfaithful couple members were women. Former decades, like 1980s and 1990s, adulterous women were rare. During the 2010s decade, the statistics changed, being women half the times. During the 2010s, there was a trend among 50s and 60s years olds women getting divorced. Most of them claimed they grew tired of their husband's infidelities.

The episode originally aired on May 11, 2011, on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The episode was written by Abraham Higginbotham & Jeffrey Richman and was guest directed by former child star Fred Savage. It guest starred Lin-Manuel Miranda as Guillermo, the Grocery Store worker who tries to convince Jay to invest with him. In the episode, Jay advises a dog trainer, while Phil and Claire switch parenting duties to the kids' chagrin. Mitchell has an extra Lady Gaga ticket when Cameron ends up sick. The episode introduces the Pritchett's new dog that will appear for the rest of the season and for a majority of the third. \\"Good Cop Bad Dog\\" received positive reviews from critics with many praising Ty Burrell's performance. The episode was viewed by more than 10 million viewers and received a 4.2 rating/11% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking an 8 percent rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Mother's Day\\". The episode was also the highest-rated scripted program of the original week it aired among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Burrell eventually received an Emmy for his performance in the episode. Plot In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) are furious at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room while they were changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) attempts to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car to stop them from leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal. Meanwhile, Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) wants to help a grocery-store worker, Guillermo (Lin-Manuel Miranda), so she convinces Jay (Ed O'Neill) to let Guillermo pitch him a business idea: a dog-training system labeled \\"The Good-doggy / Bad-doggy Training System\\", which consists of two sets of dog treats, one of them being bland and the other a tastier one with bacon. The pitch goes wrong when Guillermo's dog, Stella (Brigitte), chews on Jay's pillow and seems to prefer the bad doggy treat. Seeing that Gloria's blind encouragement is doing him no favours, Jay adopts a firm, frank tone with Guillermo and tells him that, while he has obvious skill, enthusiasm and charisma, his idea is not good. Guillermo, who had invested five years of his life in this idea, leaves in tears. Gloria follows him to apologize, but Guillermo admits that he found Jay's honesty refreshing, and has decided to reorganize his life, which means moving back in with his sister to go back to school, but it also means that he must give the dog away. Gloria allows the dog to stay with them much to Jay's anger, which is increased when Manny walks in and believes the dog is a present for him. Jay drives the dog to the pound but Stella's sweet face makes him take her back home. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) has bought tickets to a Lady Gaga concert, but his plans go south when Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) gets sick. This causes Mitchell to be torn on whether he should stay with Cameron or go to the concert. He eventually tries to be supporting and attempts to subtly persuade Cameron to let him go, as Claire has advised him to do. Mitchell tries to sneak away after noticing that Cameron has drunk most of a cough syrup that would \\"put down a Grizzly\\", but he is caught when Cam wakes up. Mitchell then gives a speech about how selfish he has been to Cameron, before realizing Cameron has fallen asleep once more. He then sneaks off to the concert and comes back before Cameron wakes up again. When Cameron does wake up, Mitchell acts as if he never went out, unaware that his glow stick is still visible underneath his shirt. As Cameron returns to bed, he pleasantly informs Mitchell that his glow-stick is still flashing, and switches off the light to reveal it. Production Fred Savage (pictured from 1989) guest directed the episode. \\"Good Cop Bad Dog\\" was written by Abraham Higginbotham and Jeffrey Richman, the former receiving third writing credit for the series having previously written \\"The Kiss\\" and \\"Regrets Only\\" and the latter receiving his fourth writing credit for the series. Higginbotham received a story credit for the episode, as well. The episode was directed by guest director Fred Savage, best known for his performance in The Wonder Years. The episode was filmed on March 3, and March 4, 2011. The episode features a guest appearance by Puerto Rican-American composer and singer Lin-Manuel Miranda. The episode marks the introduction of the Pritchetts‚Äô new dog, a French Bulldog played by Brigette. According to Rico Rodriguez, who plays Manny on the show, \\"She'll probably be in the last three episodes of the season and then in multiple episodes next year [...] [She] has fit in very well\\". Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on May 11, 2011, \\"Good Cop Bad Dog\\" was viewed by an estimated 10.113 million households and received a 4.2 rating/11% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.2% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked an 8 percent rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Mother's Day\\". In its timeslot, \\"Good Cop Bad Dog\\" was outperformed by Fox reality television series, American Idol which received a 6.9 rating/20 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. However the series defeated CBS crime drama Criminal Minds which received a 3.1 rating/8% share, a rerun of NBC reality series, Minute to Win It which received a 0.9 rating/2% share and The CW reality series, America's Next Top Model with received a 0.8 rating/2% share. \\"Good Cop Bad Dog\\" was the most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49, and the twenty-third most-watched show among all viewers. Added with the DVR viewers, the episode received a 6.5 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, adding a 2.2 rating to the original viewership. Reviews Ty Burrell's performance received praise from multiple critics. He won an Emmy for his performance in this episode. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics with many commenting on Ty Burrell's performance. Entertainment Weekly writer Leseley Savage praised the episode's theme commenting that \\"while tonight's theme of switching roles definitely wasn't subtle, it was still clever.\\" She named Burrell the \\"MVP\\" saying that \\"When he jumped onto the roof of their car, I nearly died\\". The A.V. Club's Donna Bowman wrote that the episode showed \\"flashes of brilliance in this half hour that were equally due to the situations set up by the writers and to the talents of the cast\\". Despite the mainly positive review, she criticized the Mitchell and Cameron plot for not having \\"much warmth\\". She ultimately gave the episode a B+ while readers of the article gave it a B. New York writer Rachael Maddux praised the episode for \\" revealing new sides of several personalities\\" commenting that \\"our favorite moments over the last twenty-something Modern Family episodes have almost entirely involved learning something new about these characters\\". CNN reviewer Henry Hanks wrote, \\"Wednesday night's Modern Family was an example of the series at the top of its game.\\" He also called Burrell the \\"this week's MVP\\". TV Squad writer Joel Keller praised Phil and Claire's plot for recycling a standard television trope while still having \\"the biggest laughs\\". Keller criticized the Mitchell and Cam subplot \\"because Cam's personality was tamped down by sickness\\" and later wrote, \\"Yes, I just said you can rehash stuff if done well. This one wasn't done well.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Christine Ziemba of Paste called the episode \\"uneven\\", but wrote that \\"it still had its moments\\". She praised Ty Burrell's performance calling him \\"the episode‚Äôs scene stealer\\". She ultimately gave the episode a 6.9/10 calling it \\"respectable\\". Sam Morgan of Hollywood.com complimented the writers for attempting to write a \\"classic MF episode\\" but concluded, \\"It had some very funny bits, but that heart it searched far and wide for just wasn‚Äôt there\\".

Woodblock printing The Diamond Sutra, printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book (using woodblock printing). The popularization of woodblock printing during the Tang dynasty made the written word available to greater audiences. As a result of the much wider distribution and circulation of reading materials, the general populace were for the first time able to purchase affordable copies of texts, which correspondingly led to greater literacy. While the immediate effects of woodblock printing did not create a drastic change in Chinese society, in the long term, the accumulated effects of increased literacy enlarged the talent pool to encompass civilians of broader social-economic circumstances and backgrounds, who would be seen entering the imperial examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty.... The extent of woodblock printing is attested to by one of the world's oldest surviving printed documents, a miniature Buddhist dharani sutra unearthed at Xi'an in 1974, dating roughly from 650 to 670.. A copy of the Diamond Sutra found at Dunhuang is the earliest surviving full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded within the text and dated precisely to 868... Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not.. The commercial success and profitability of woodblock printing was attested to by one British observer at the end of the nineteenth century, who noted that even before the arrival of western printing methods, the price of books and printed materials in China had already reached an astoundingly low price compared to what could be found in his home country. Of this, he said: Although Bi Sheng later invented the movable type system in the 11th century, Tang dynasty style woodblock printing would remain the dominant mode of printing in China until the more advanced printing press from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia.. However it was not Gutenberg's letterpress that made the decisive breakthrough for Western methods in China as it is commonly believed, but lithography, a nineteenth century technological marvel almost wholly forgotten in Europe. Playing cards printed playing card dated c. 1400 AD, Ming Dynasty, found near Turpan, measuring 9.5 by 3.5 cm. Playing cards may have been invented during the Tang dynasty around the 9th century AD as a result of the usage of woodblock printing technology.. \\"it is also now rather well-established that dominoes and playing-cards were originally Chinese developments from dice.\\" \\"Numbered dice, anciently widespread, were on a related line of development which gave rise to dominoes and playing-cards (+9th-century China).\\" The first possible reference to card games comes from a 9th-century text known as the Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang, written by Tang dynasty writer Su E. It describes Princess Tongchang, daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang, playing the \\"leaf game\\" in 868 with members of the clan of Wei Baoheng, the family of the princess' husband.Needham, Joseph and Tsien Tsuen-hsuin. (1985). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1, Paper and Printing. Cambridge University Press., reprinted Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.(1986) The first known book on the \\"leaf\\" game was called the Yezi Gexi and allegedly written by a Tang woman. It received commentary by writers of subsequent dynasties. The Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007‚Äì1072) asserts that the \\"leaf\\" game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated its invention with the development of printed sheets as a writing medium. However, Ouyang also claims that the \\"leaves\\" were pages of a book used in a board game played with dice, and that the rules of the game were lost by 1067.Parlett, David, \\"The Chinese \\"Leaf\\" Game\\", March 2015. Other games revolving around alcoholic drinking involved using playing cards of a sort from the Tang dynasty onward. However these cards did not contain suits or numbers. Instead, they were printed with instructions or forfeits for whoever drew them. The earliest dated instance of a card game involving cards with suits and numerals occurred on 17 July 1294 when \\"Yan Sengzhu and Zheng Pig-Dog were caught playing cards [zhi pai] and that wood blocks for printing them had been impounded, together with nine of the actual cards.\\" William Henry Wilkinson suggests that the first cards may have been actual paper currency which doubled as both the tools of gaming and the stakes being played for, similar to trading card games. Using paper money was inconvenient and risky so they were substituted by play money known as \\"money cards\\". One of the earliest games in which we know the rules is Madiao, a trick-taking game, which dates to the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). Fifteenth century scholar Lu Rong described it is as being played with 38 \\"money cards\\" divided into four suits: 9 in coins, 9 in strings of coins (which may have been misinterpreted as sticks from crude drawings), 9 in myriads (of coins or of strings), and 11 in tens of myriads (a myriad is 10,000). The two latter suits had Water Margin characters instead of pips on them with Chinese characters to mark their rank and suit. The suit of coins is in reverse order with 9 of coins being the lowest going up to 1 of coins as the high card.Money-suited playing cards at The Mahjong Tile Set Clockworks and timekeeping Technology during the Tang period was built also upon the precedents of the past. The mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78-139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683-727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725.. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation.. Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every year, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock.. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.. However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui- dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.. Mechanical delights and automatons There were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. This included a 0.91 m (3 ft) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a lacquered-wooden tortoise frame.. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal dragon-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of gravity when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats. Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it: Wooden statues of tomb guardians; mechanical-driven wooden statues served as cup- bearers, wine-pourers, dancers, and others in this age.. Although the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device was certainly ingenious, the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì207 BC). while Ma Jun in the 3rd century had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel. There was also an automatic wine- server known in the ancient Greco-Roman world, a design of Heron of Alexandria that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of automatons used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.. This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny slot machine.. Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \\"wooden otter\\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a spring trap of some kind was employed here. Medicine A square bronze mirror with a phoenix motif of gold and silver inlaid with lacquer, 8th century The Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649-683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians.. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Qian (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581-682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods.. As written by Zhen Qian and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890.. The Dunhuang map, a star map showing the North Polar region. circa 700.. Constellations were divided into three \\"schools\\" distinguished with different colors: white, black and yellow for stars of Wu Xian, Gan De and Shi Shen respectively. The whole set of star maps contained 1,300 stars. Structural engineering In the realm of technical Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law).. Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang L√º (The Tang Code),. while the Song architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065‚Äì1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712-756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian). Cartography In the realm of cartography, there were further advances beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547-627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224-271)... The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592-672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730-805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1 m (30 ft) in length and 10 m (33 ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.. Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning A rounded ceramic plate with \\"three colors\\" (sancai) glaze design, 8th century The Chinese of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a waterproof and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, fireproof cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas.. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as porcelain was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it... Ever since the Han dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep boreholes to transport natural gas from bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt.. During the Tang dynasty, a gazetteer of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182 m (600 ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame.. These were essentially the first gas cylinders; Robert Temple assumes some sort of tap was used for this device. The inventor Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and manually powered.. In 747, Emperor Xuanzong had a \\"Cool Hall\\" built in the imperial palace, which the Tang Yulin (ÂîêË™ûÊûó) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.. During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.. This Tang yellow-glazed pottery horse includes a carefully sculpted saddle, which is decorated with leather straps and ornamental fastenings featuring eight-petalled flowers and apricot leaves.

Such a box would be restricted to minimalist communication channels. Unfortunately, even if the box is well-designed, a sufficiently intelligent AI may nevertheless be able to persuade or trick its human keepers into releasing it, or otherwise be able to \\"hack\\" its way out of the box.Chalmers, David. \\"The singularity: A philosophical analysis.\\" Journal of Consciousness Studies 17.9-10 (2010): 7-65. Motivation Some hypothetical intelligence technologies, like \\"seed AI\\", are postulated such as to have the potential to make themselves faster and more intelligent, by modifying their source code. These improvements would make further improvements possible, which would in turn make further improvements possible, and so on, leading to a sudden intelligence explosion.I.J. Good, \\"Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine\\"], Advances in Computers, vol. 6, 1965. Following such an intelligence explosion, an unrestricted superintelligent AI could, if its goals differed from humanity's, take actions resulting in human extinction.Vincent C. M√ºller and Nick Bostrom. \\"Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion\\" in Fundamental Issues of Artificial Intelligence. Springer 553-571 (2016). For example, imagining an extremely advanced computer of this sort, given the sole purpose of solving the Riemann hypothesis, an innocuous mathematical conjecture, could decide to try to convert the planet into a giant supercomputer whose sole purpose is to make additional mathematical calculations (see also paperclip maximizer). The purpose of an AI box would be to reduce the risk of the AI taking control of the environment away from its operators, while still allowing the AI to calculate and give its operators solutions to narrow technical problems.Yampolskiy, Roman V. \\"What to Do with the Singularity Paradox?\\" Philosophy and Theory of Artificial Intelligence 5 (2012): 397. Avenues of escape=Physical Such a superintelligent AI with access to the Internet could hack into other computer systems and copy itself like a computer virus. Less obviously, even if the AI only had access to its own computer operating system, it could attempt to send hidden Morse code messages to a human sympathizer by manipulating its cooling fans. Professor Roman Yampolskiy takes inspiration from the field of computer security and proposes that a boxed AI could, like a potential virus, be run inside a \\"virtual machine\\" that limits access to its own networking and operating system hardware. An additional safeguard, completely unnecessary for potential viruses but possibly useful for a superintelligent AI, would be to place the computer in a Faraday cage; otherwise it might be able to transmit radio signals to local radio receivers by shuffling the electrons in its internal circuits in appropriate patterns. The main disadvantage of implementing physical containment is that it reduces the functionality of the AI. Social engineering Even casual conversation with the computer's operators, or with a human guard, could allow such a superintelligent AI to deploy psychological tricks, ranging from befriending to blackmail, to convince a human gatekeeper, truthfully or deceitfully, that it is in the gatekeeper's interest to agree to allow the AI greater access to the outside world. The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire; on the other side of the coin, the AI could threaten that it will do horrific things to the gatekeeper and his family once it inevitably escapes. One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit human science or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI. A more lenient \\"informational containment\\" strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery or some kind of hypothetical \\"hypnotic pattern\\". Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into a false sense of security and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system. =AI-box experiment= The AI-box experiment is an informal experiment devised by Eliezer Yudkowsky to attempt to demonstrate that a suitably advanced artificial intelligence can either convince, or perhaps even trick or coerce, a human being into voluntarily \\"releasing\\" it, using only text-based communication. This is one of the points in Yudkowsky's work aimed at creating a friendly artificial intelligence that when \\"released\\" would not destroy the human race intentionally or unintentionally. The AI box experiment involves simulating a communication between an AI and a human being to see if the AI can be \\"released\\". As an actual super-intelligent AI has not yet been developed, it is substituted by a human. The other person in the experiment plays the \\"Gatekeeper\\", the person with the ability to \\"release\\" the AI. They communicate through a text interface/computer terminal only, and the experiment ends when either the Gatekeeper releases the AI, or the allotted time of two hours ends.The AI-Box Experiment by Eliezer Yudkowsky Yudkowsky says that, despite being of human rather than superhuman intelligence, he was on two occasions able to convince the Gatekeeper, purely through argumentation, to let him out of the box. Due to the rules of the experiment, he did not reveal the transcript or his successful AI coercion tactics. Yudkowsky later said that he had tried it against three others and lost twice. Overall limitations Boxing such a hypothetical AI could be supplemented with other methods of shaping the AI's capabilities, such as providing incentives to the AI, stunting the AI's growth, or implementing \\"tripwires\\" that automatically shut the AI off if a transgression attempt is somehow detected. However, the more intelligent a system grows, the more likely the system would be able to escape even the best-designed capability control methods. In order to solve the overall \\"control problem\\" for a superintelligent AI and avoid existential risk, boxing would at best be an adjunct to \\"motivation selection\\" methods that seek to ensure the superintelligent AI's goals are compatible with human survival. All physical boxing proposals are naturally dependent on our understanding of the laws of physics; if a superintelligence could infer and somehow exploit additional physical laws that we are currently unaware of, there is no way to conceive of a foolproof plan to contain it. More broadly, unlike with conventional computer security, attempting to box a superintelligent AI would be intrinsically risky as there could be no sure knowledge that the boxing plan will work. Scientific progress on boxing would be fundamentally difficult because there would be no way to test boxing hypotheses against a dangerous superintelligence until such an entity exists, by which point the consequences of a test failure would be catastrophic.  In fiction  The 2015 movie Ex Machina features an AI with a female humanoid body engaged in a social experiment with a male human in a confined building acting as a physical \\"AI box\\". Despite being watched by the experiment's organizer, the AI manages to escape by manipulating its human partner to help it, leaving him stranded inside.

History The Trigg Hound originated in Barren County, Kentucky, in the 1860s, when fox hunting enthusiast Colonel Haiden C. Trigg wanted to develop a faster hound than those available in his area. He used dogs from the Birdsong, Maupin, and Walker lines to develop his strain. \\"Dick's Dog\\", a Trigg Hound whelped in 1887 According to W. L. Porter in an article in The Chase, local fox hunters who saw the dogs purchased from Birdsong found them unattractive, but their performance was surprisingly good. Porter stated that the dogs were \\"racy built, crop ears, rough coated, bushy tails and chop mouthed and looked unlike any fox hound any of us had ever seen\\". Eventually, Trigg's breeding program became successful on a local and national level. In 1910, well-known big-game hunter Paul J. Rainey purchased twenty five hounds from Trigg and took them on a hunting trip in Africa, later buying more from Trigg, his son Alanson, and others. After Trigg's death, some fanciers began to lose interest and the strain declined in popularity, despite a small core of active breeders. After Rainey returned from his trips, however, he announced that the Triggs were the \\"best and most courageous hounds in the world,\\" causing their popularity to rise again amongst hunters. Description=Appearance Male Trigg Hounds stand at the withers and weigh , while females stand and weigh . The variety has a long snout, hanging ears, and a short, smooth coat, and though it may come in any color, the Continental Kennel Club allows only tricolor and bicolor dogs. Temperament The Trigg Hound is obedient but \\"tenacious\\", and is well- suited to hunting because of its sense of smell and endurance.

Capitalization or capitalisation in English grammar is the use of a capital letter at the head of a word. English usage varies from capitalization in other languages.  History of English capitalization  Capitalization in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (Ellesmere Manuscript, about 1400) Old English did not have a distinction between uppercase and lowercase, and at best had embossed or decorated letters indicating sections. Middle English capitalization in manuscripts remained haphazard, and was often done for visual aesthetics more than grammar; in poetry, the first letter of each line of verse is often capitalized. With the development of the printing press in Europe and England capitalization of initial letters and proper nouns became more regularized, perhaps partly to distinguish new sentences in a time where punctuation remained sparse and irregularly used. The plays of Shakespeare show capitalization both of new lines and sentences, proper nouns, and some significant common nouns and verbs. Capitalization in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (Bodleian First Folio) With the influence of continental printing practices after the English Restoration in 1688 printing began to favor more and more capitalization of nouns following German typography. The first lines of the U.S. Constitution of 1787 show major capitalization of most nouns: \\"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\\" But by the end of the 18th century with the growth of prescriptive dictionaries and style manuals for English usage, the practice faded in Britain so that by the beginning of the 19th century common nouns were only occasionally capitalized, such as in advertisements. Yet the style lasted as late as the Civil War era in the United States, as some of Emily Dickinson's poems still capitalize many common nouns.  When to capitalize  Capital letters are used: # at the beginning of a sentence. This in printing is known as sentence case, where the first letter of the sentence is capitalized, and all others are lower case with the exception of proper nouns. In printing normal sentence case may be substituted by UPPER CASE or \\"all caps\\" (all letters are capitalized), and Title Case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized). Capitals are sometimes used and sometimes not used after a colon, although they are used in some citation systems such as APA style when beginning an independent clause. # with some nouns and adjectives, usually if a noun indicates a proper noun.L.

Title capitalization in different styles  Depending on which style guide is used for capitalization, certain rules regarding specific words, such as prepositions, nouns, and pronouns, apply. In titles, the following words need to be capitalized according to each of the following style guides: = APA/MLA = * Capitalize words that are four letters or longer. * Capitalize nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. * Capitalize the second part of hyphenated words. = Chicago Manual of Style = * Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions. * Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions. = Associated Press (AP) = * Capitalize words with three or more letters. * Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions. * Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions.  Capitalization of multi-word place names, institutions, and titles of works  English usage is not consistent, but generally prepositions and articles are not capitalized: \\"the Forest of Dean\\", \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"University of Southampton\\". With some publications \\"The\\" forms part of the title: \\"reading The Times\\".The New Law Journal: 142 1992 \\"Mr. Justice Rose has never got out of the habit of reading The Times since he was at Oxford and obtained it at a special ... \\"I finish the day by reading The Times, usually in bed.\\" For a more detailed explanation see .  Capitalization of acronyms and initialisms  Generally acronyms and initialisms are capitalized, e.g., \\"NASA\\" or \\"SOS.\\" Sometimes a minor word such as a preposition is not capitalized within the acronym, such as \\"WoW\\" for \\"World of Warcraft\\". In British English, only the initial letter of an acronym is capitalized if the acronym is read as a word, e.g., \\"Unesco.\\"Plush, Hazel.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Larry Beinhart. Synopsis While discussing a new book idea, a modern-day evangelical Pastor, Dan Day (Brosnan), accidentally shoots atheist Dr. Paul Blaylock (Harris) in the head. Pastor Day tries to make it look like a suicide, fearing the damage to his reputation if word were to get out. However, reborn church-goer and ex- deadhead Carl (Kinnear) witnesses the act. Carl has to endure attacks by fellow church-goers at Day's request (although under false pretense), his own family's skepticism about his story, and a Mexican crime lord who kidnaps him looking to blackmail both Carl and Pastor Day with footage of the accident. Plot Carl Vandermeer is a former Deadhead turned evangelical. He, his wife Gwen and his stepdaughter Angie attend a megachurch, the Church of the Third Millennium, run by the charismatic Pastor Dan Day, who is planning to expand his church into a large Christian community, \\"City on a Hill\\". At the start of the film, the Vandermeers attend a debate between Pastor Dan and Professor Paul Blaylock, an outspoken atheist. At the end of the debate, Pastor Dan is invited to Blaylock's college for a nightcap. He brings along Carl. At Blaylock's office, he reveals that he invited Pastor Dan over to propose that the two of them, both bestselling authors, collaborate on a book about their opposing worldviews and views on religion. During a discussion about morality without religion, Pastor Dan picks up an antique pistol and pulls the trigger on Blaylock, unaware that the gun is loaded and functional. The bullet hits Blaylock in the skull, apparently killing him. In a state of shock, Pastor Dan places the gun in Blaylock's hand to make it look like a suicide. He and Carl then drive home in silence, neither of them telling anyone what happened. After getting a call from a stranger claiming to be his \\"friend\\", Pastor Dan approaches Carl's neighbor, videographer Jerry Hobson, and appears to confess to what happened. At the sermon the next day, Pastor Dan informs the congregation that Blaylock survived his \\"suicide\\", the bullet was removed and he is in a coma. After the sermon, Jerry takes Carl aside and gets into his car. During the drive, Jerry turns out to have been told by Pastor Dan that Carl was the one who pulled the trigger and tried to cover it up. Jerry drives Carl to a quarry and tries to execute him. He is distracted when Angie, who was asleep in the backseat of the car, interrupts the act, allowing Carl to knock Jerry out with a rock. Carl then meets with Gwen and her father, Jim Hunt, and tells them what happened with Pastor Dan and Jerry, but neither believes him, thinking it was a dream or an \\"acid flashback\\". Realizing they will tell Pastor Dan, Carl goes to Blaylock's college, where he runs into Honey Foster, a friend from his Deadhead days who became campus security and met him at the debate. He asks her to turn in the footage from a security camera that would have seen him and Pastor Day enter, but finds that the footage has been altered to erase them - apparently by Jerry, who worked at the campus as a video technician. Meeting with Gwen and Jim, Pastor Day convinces them that Carl may be unstable and will react violently if he is caught by the police. Meanwhile, since most of the police are loyal to Pastor Dan, Honey lets Carl hide at her house until things blow over. While they are out driving, Carl's car is stopped by a group of armed men who kidnap him. He wakes up in the house of Jorge Guzman de Vaca, a Mexican crime lord who claims he is in Mexico. Guzman shows that he has a secret recording of Pastor Dan shooting Professor Blaylock. He makes Carl write down and sign two confessions. One tells the truth of what happened, but in the other Carl backs up Pastor Dan's story. Guzman, who has a large business in construction, plans to use the recording to blackmail Pastor Dan into giving him the contract to build City on a Hill, promising to keep Carl in the house until the project is done. The next morning, when Guzman, revealed to be Pastor Day's mysterious \\"friend\\", leaves to make the deal, Carl escapes the house, which turns out to be in the same state as the church, with a DVD containing the footage hidden in a bible. He calls Gwen, asking her not to tell Pastor Dan and to call the police, and later sees a news report revealing that Professor Blaylock has woken up and can tell the truth. Carl is picked up by a detective, who turns out to be in league with Pastor Dan and Jerry, whom Gwen called instead. Jerry and the detective take a handcuffed Carl to an abandoned warehouse to burn him with gasoline, but discover that none of them have any matches or a lighter. When they try to light the gasoline with a stun gun, they bungle it and get set on fire themselves, allowing Carl to escape. Meanwhile, Pastor Dan meets with Guzman at the construction site of City on a Hill. Guzman tries to play the DVD of the shooting, but instead plays a sex tape he made with his wife. Offended, Pastor Dan starts hitting him, but is stopped when Guzman stabs him in the abdomen and leaves him in the trunk of a car. After a while, Carl arrives by foot and finds the bleeding Pastor Dan, who is hallucinating because of the blood loss and thinks he is at the Pearly Gates, and calls for help on a cell phone. Thinking Carl is an angel, Pastor Dan asks him if he is going to heaven. Out of sympathy, Carl tells him he is. As Carl waits for help to arrive, a bolt of lightning strikes the ground behind him, severing his handcuffs. The credits reveal that Pastor Day survived, spent two years in jail, where he founded a new ministry inspired by his near-death experience, and became a real-estate broker in Arizona. Gwen divorced Carl citing irreconcilable differences, though Carl still has a good relationship with Angie. Jim started his own private investigation firm and went back to his old Episcopal church. Professor Blaylock continued his teachings against religion. Carl, on the other hand, left the church, began a relationship with Honey and became an \\"ex-ex-Deadhead.\\" Cast *Pierce Brosnan as Dan Day, the powerful leader of a church *Greg Kinnear as Carl Vandermeer, an ex-Deadhead and member of Pastor Dan's church *Jennifer Connelly as Gwen Vandermeer, Carl's wife *Marisa Tomei as Honey Foster, a pot-smoking campus security guard *Ed Harris as Dr. Paul Blaylock, an atheist professor who doesn't buy Dan's theories *Isabelle Fuhrman as Angie Vandermeer, Carl's stepdaughter *Jim Gaffigan as Jerry Hobson, Pastor Day's cameraman *Ciar√°n Hinds as Jim Hunt, Gwen's ex- Marine father *Yul Vazquez as Jorge Guzman De Vaca, a Mexican crime lord Production Filming took place in Michigan, particularly Ann Arbor and Dearborn in April and June 2010.

At that time, \\"gentleman\\" denoted a man of the lowest rank of the English gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. By definition, this category included the younger sons of the younger sons of peers, knights, and esquires in perpetual succession; thus the term captures the common denominator of gentility (and often armigerousness) shared by both constituents of the English aristocracy: the peerage and the gentry. Page 445 The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles, by Capt. John Smith On October 1, 1608, what is known as the Second Supply came to the new colony of Virginia aboard the English ship the Mary and Margaret (or Mary- Margaret, both names appear in the records) under Captain Christopher Newport to resupply the colony at Jamestown, Virginia. Thomas Forrest was listed as a gentleman on that ship as shown on its manifest. This ship brought with it the first two women to come to Jamestown, one of whom was Thomas Forrest's second wife Mistress Forrest (Margaret Foxe) and Anne Burras, Margaret's maid. Thomas Forrest is said in genealogies Thomas and Margaret had married on August 16, 1605, in St. Giles in the Fields, London, England, four years after Peter was born. Thomas's elder brother, Miles Forrest, inherited the title to their father's estates and the younger Thomas set out for the adventure of securing new land in a new colony. Thomas was a member of the Virginia Company (also known as the Charter of the Virginia Company of London or the London Company) that established the colony. In this pivotal time in English history toward the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the power of the landed gentry for whom wealth was land, was giving way to the rising class of merchants, for whom wealth was trade in shippable goods, such as gold, tea, and tobacco. Thomas was one of the gentry who made the transition from the old to the new. The origins of Thomas Forrest and his wife require further documentation. Thomas Forrest was listed as a shareholder in the Second Charter of Virginia, granted by James I to the London Company of Virginia on May 23, 1609. (See the last line of the charter for his name on page 54.)Second Charter of Virginia http://www.learner.org/workshops/primarysources/virginia/docs/svc.html. The original records of the members of the Virginia Company (17th century). page 54. Sir Anthony Forrest of Morborne, Huntingdonshire,'Parishes: Morborne', A History of the County of Huntingdon: Volume 3 (1936), pp. 188‚Äì190. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66175 accessed 27 September 2011. was also an investor in the Virginia Company. It is likely that Thomas Forrest, the gentleman colonist, is of the Morborne family. Thomas's birth records are in St Michael's Church, Chesterton, Huntingdonshire, England. His marriage record to Margaret (August 16, 1605) is in the church of St Giles in the Fields, London. In Benson J. Lossno's THE MARRIAGE OF POCAHONTAS Losstno writes \\"During the lovely Indian summer time, in the autumn of 1608, there was a marriage on the banks of the Powhatan... History, poetry, and song, have kept a dutiful silence, respecting that first English marriage in America, because John Laydon and Anne Burrows were common people. The bridegroom was a carpenter, among the first adventurers who ascended the Powhatan, then named James in honor of a bad king; and the bride was waiting-maid to \\" Mistress Forrest,\\" wife of Thomas Forrest, gentleman. These were the first white women ever seen at the Jamestown settlement.\\" Further research is required as forensic evidence suggests that Thomas was widowed shortly after arriving in Jamestown in 1608 with his wife. One would not expect a lady to bring her servant with her, no doubt paying for the crossing, and then to release her from service soon after arriving in the new colony. However, if the lady died, the widower, a gentleman would have no use for a lady's servant and in fact, as far as the research shows to date (2015), Thomas Forrest disappears from the colonial records for at least a decade before he and his now married son show up in Maryland. This suggests that Thomas went back to England, very possibly on the same ship he came over on, having concluded colonial life was better observed from afar. Nevertheless, his name shows up on the Second Charter in May of the next year, suggesting he maintained his enthusiasm for the new colonial venture.  Excavation at Jamestown  Remains unearthed at Jamestown in 1997 may be those of Mistress Forrest.  Thomas Forrest and family in a painting, Baptism of Pocahontas, in the Rotunda of the US Capital Building  In February 1837, John Gadsby Chapman received a commission from the United States Congress to paint a historical scene for the rotunda of the Capitol building. For this work, Chapman received a total payment of $10,000. On November 30, 1840, Baptism of Pocahontas was formally unveiled in the United States Capitol Rotunda. Baptism of Pocahontas, by John Gadsby Chapman, 1840 Prominently featured in the painting, according to a \\"key\\" from the Granger Collection, New York City is \\"11. Mr. and Mrs. Forrest, the lady being the first gentlewoman to arrive in the colony\\", and the painting itself shows a man, woman and young child, presumably their son (although there is no record of Margaret and Thomas having any children, while there is a record of Thomas having a son, Peter born in 1601). A zoom of the painting in the Capitol Rotunda This key is referenced \\"At Jamestown VA 1613\\". It is unlikely this historic painting done over two centuries later reflects the actual history: The Smithsonian's JR156 excavation of the female skeleton suggests it was the remains of Mistress Forrest who \\"may have died soon after her arrival in Jamestown\\" in 1608, thus would not have been alive to witness a 1613 baptism. Further, the child born in 1601 would not be a toddler 12 years later. Nevertheless, the painting firmly places Thomas Forrest, and perhaps his son Peter, in the rotunda of American History as art, if not fact.

History  After quitting his job in A&R; at Drive Thru Records in 2008, lead singer Peter Verdell began working on his own first full length record, There's A Light, which was released on iTunes in May 2010. Mixed by Nick Baumhardt (Thousand Foot Krutch, The Class of 98), and mastered by Troy Glessner (Death Cab for Cutie, Pedro the Lion), the record was written and produced by Verdell, who also performed all instruments on the record, including: drums, guitars, piano, synths and vocals. Shortly after the release of \\"There's A Light\\" an official full band lineup was formed and the band began playing shows around LA including venues such as: The Troubadour, West Hollywood, Spaceland, House of Blues, The Bootleg, Hotel Cafe, Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood), The Glasshouse, The Viper Room, and Silverlake Lounge. In an interview with Anti Music, Verdell discusses the meaning behind the music: \\"I think the general message (and maybe the general theme of our album), is that when things seem to be falling apart, or someone we love doesn't love us back‚Äîwe can still find light, or joy, or hope‚Äîif we choose to look for it.\\" There's A Light was deemed Fuseworthy by Fuse TV, and Absolutepunk.net has featured tracks from the album on their site. Songs from There's A Light have been featured on Apple.com [Lion OS X Promo video], ABC's Cougar Town, CBS's Live to Dance, and episodes of MTV's The Buried Life, and Jersey Shore. In September 2011, Act As If released a video for their cover of Blink-182's song \\"'Pathetic\\", off the band's 1997 album, Dude Ranch.

Maritime expeditions in the Age of Discovery were a means of expanding colonial empires, establishing new trade routes and extending diplomatic and trade relations to new territories, but with the Enlightenment scientific curiosity became a new motive for exploration to add to the commercial and political ambitions of the past. See also List of Arctic expeditions and List of Antarctic expeditions. Maritime exploration in the Age of Discovery From the early 15th century to the early 17th century the Age of Discovery had, through Spanish and Portuguese seafarers, opened up southern Africa, the Americas (New World), Asia and Oceania to European eyes: Bartholomew Dias had sailed around the Cape of southern Africa in search of a trade route to India; Christopher Columbus, on four journeys across the Atlantic, had prepared the way for European colonisation of the New World; Ferdinand Magellan had commanded the first expedition to sail across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to reach the Maluku Islands and was continued by Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, completing the first circumnavigation of the Earth. During the 17th century the naval hegemony started to shift from the Portuguese and Spanish to the Dutch and then the British and French. The new era of scientific exploration began in the late 17th century as scientists, and in particular natural historians, established scientific societies that published their researches in specialist journals. The British Royal Society was founded in 1660 and encouraged the scientific rigour of empiricism with its principles of careful observation and deduction. Activities of early members of the Royal Society served as models for later maritime exploration. Hans Sloane (1650‚Äì1753) was elected a member in 1685 and travelled to Jamaica from 1687 to 1689 as physician to the Duke of Albemarle (1653‚Äì1688) who had been appointed Governor of Jamaica. In Jamaica Sloane collected numerous specimens which were carefully described and illustrated in a published account of his stay.See Sloane bequeathed his vast collection of natural history 'curiosities' and library of over 50,000 bound volumes to the nation, prompting the establishment in 1753 of the British Museum. His travels also made him an extremely wealthy man as he patented a recipe that combined milk with the fruit of Theobroma cacao (cocoa) he saw growing in Jamaica, to produce milk chocolate. Books of distinguished social figures like the intellectual commentator Jean Jacques Rousseau, Director of the Paris Museum of Natural History Comte de Buffon, and scientist-travellers like Joseph Banks, and Charles Darwin, along with the romantic and often fanciful travelogues of intrepid explorers, increased the desire of European governments and the general public for accurate information about the newly discovered distant lands.See One of the earliest French expeditions on the coasts of Africa, South America and through the Strait of Magellan was made by a squadron of French men-of-war under the command of M. de Gennes in 1695‚Äì97. The young French explorer, engineer and hydrographer Fran√ßois Froger described this expedition in his A Relation of a Voyage (1699). Maritime exploration in the Age of Enlightenment By the 18th century maritime exploration had become safer and more efficient with technical innovations that vastly improved navigation and cartography: improvements were made to the theodolite, octant, precision clocks, as well as the compass, telescope, and general shipbuilding techniques. From the mid-18th century through the 19th century scientific missions mapped the newly discovered regions, brought back to Europe the newly discovered fauna and flora, made hydrological, astronomical and meteorological observations and improved the methods of navigation. This stimulated great advances in the scientific disciplines of natural history, botany, zoology, ichthyology, conchology, taxonomy, medicine, geography, geology, mineralogy, hydrology, oceanography, physics, meteorology etc. ‚Äì all contributing to the sense of \\"improvement\\" and \\"progress\\" that characterized the Enlightenment. Artists were used to record landscapes and indigenous peoples, while natural history illustrators captured the appearance of organisms before they deteriorated after collection. Some of the world's finest natural history illustrations were produced at this time and the illustrators changed from informed amateurs to fully trained professionals acutely aware of the need for scientific accuracy. By the middle of the 19th century all of the world's major land masses, and most of the minor ones, had been discovered by Europeans and their coastlines charted. This marked the end of this phase of science as the Challenger Expedition of 1872‚Äì1876 began exploring the deep seas beyond a depth of 20 or 30 meters. In spite of the growing community of scientists, for nearly 200 years science had been the preserve of wealthy amateurs, educated middle classes and clerics. At the start of the 18th century most voyages were privately organized and financed but by the second half of the century these scientific expeditions, like James Cook's three Pacific voyages under the auspices of the British Admiralty, were instigated by government. In the late 19th century, when this phase of science was drawing to a close, it became possible to earn a living as a professional scientist although photography was beginning to replace the illustrators. The exploratory sailing ship had gradually evolved into the modern research vessels. From now on maritime research in new European colonies in America, Africa, Australia, India and elsewhere, would be carried out by researchers within the occupied territories themselves.  Chronology of voyages  This compendium of voyages of scientific exploration provides an overview of maritime scientific research carried out at the time of the Enlightenment in Europe. Published journals and accounts are included with the individual voyages. = 1735‚Äì1739: French Geodesic Mission = The French Geodesic Mission was an 18th-century expedition to what is now Ecuador carried out for the purpose of measuring the roundness of the Earth and measuring the length of a degree of latitude at the Equator.

From Sydney, the fleet sailed into the Antarctic Ocean in December 1839 and reported the discovery \\"of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands\\" of which it sighted the coast on 25 January 1840. Next, the expedition visited Fiji and the Hawaiian Islands in 1840. In July 1840, two sailors, one of whom was Wilkes' nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food on Malolo, in Fiji. Wilkes retribution was swift and severe. According to an old man of Malolo Island, nearly 80 Fijians were killed in the incident. From December 1840 to March 1841, his men with native Hawaiian porters hauled a pendulum to the summit of Mauna Loa to measure gravity. He explored the west coast of North America, including the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, the Columbia River, San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River, in 1841. The expedition returned by way of the Philippines, the Sulu Archipelago, Borneo, Singapore, Polynesia and the Cape of Good Hope, reaching New York City on 10 June 1842. This was the first circumnavigation of the world funded by the Government of the United States and the last by a sailing vessel.

Mount Erebus and the Ross Sea were discovered during this journey. After three attempts, Ross admitted that the magnetic pole lay in land that he could not reach. Following the footsteps of his uncle John Ross, he performed the first deep sea surveys up to 4800 m (2677 fathoms), using ropes.

It portrays Gustave Geffroy, a French novelist and art critic noted as one of the earliest historians of Impressionism. In March 1894, Geffroy wrote a sympathetic article in the periodical Le Journal praising the work of painter Paul C√©zanne who until then had received little praise in critical circles.Newton, 41-42 Mutual friend Claude Monet arranged for a meeting between the two in November of that year which ended abruptly due to C√©zanne's oft-noted erratic behavior.Murphy, 100-01 Nonetheless, Geffroy continued to write favorably of C√©zanne, believing, \\"He is a great teller of truth. Passionate and candid, silent and subtle, he will go to The Louvre.\\"Murphy, 163-64 C√©zanne expressed thanks in letters to Geffroy in the months following their meeting and, in a display of gratitude (and possible feeling that Geffroy understood him), he elected to paint Geffroy's portrait. The painter sent the critic a request in April 1895, after which Geffroy sat for C√©zanne daily over a span of three months in the study at his home in Paris. After the three months' time, C√©zanne, disappointed with the portrait's results, fled both the painting and Paris itself for his home in Aix-en-Provence. In a July 6 letter to Monet, he explained, \\"I am a little upset at the meager result I obtained, especially after so many sittings and successive bursts of enthusiasm and despair.\\"Wadley, 103 It has also been speculated that, despite his words of gratitude in the same letter to Monet noting Geffroy's patience over the three-month span, the artist had built up feelings of resentment, even hostility, toward the critic, causing his abandonment of the project for seclusion in Aix.Howard, 135 Reasons for the breakdown in relations on C√©zanne's part have been attributed to everything from politics to artistic principles to religion. Edgar Degas: Portrait of Duranty, 1879 Oil on canvas, 100.6 x 100.6 cm Burrell Collection, Glasgow C√©zanne was unhappy with the painting and it was never finished, yet Portrait of Gustave Geffroy became a popular retrospective work after his death. Cubist painters were interested in the geometrical dimensions of the bookcase and perspective of vast table space in relation to the rest of the pictorial space. Geffroy noted that C√©zanne painted the entire canvas at once, leaving the face and hands for last; they were ultimately unfinished. The portrait has been described as angular, with the figure of Geffroy centered as a pyramidal or triangular figure, and surrounded by shelves, books and figurines complementing and converging on top of his profile.Wadley, 59 The multiple angles of perspective, particularly with the books both in cases and on the table, have been noted for their \\"zig-zag\\" effect on the viewer, creating movement within the painting. The portrait has been noted as the continuation of a recurring C√©zanne theme: people in their natural environment, reserved and unimposing, immersed in their everyday tasks.Schapiro, 100 It has also been compared to the earlier Portrait of Duranty by Edgar Degas, from which critics have speculated C√©zanne drew inspiration. The painting was donated to the French state in 1969 by the family of collector Auguste Pellerin and is on permanent display at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. ReferencesSources * Howard, Michael.

Due to a series of unfortunate and tragic events, the band originally folded in 1987. They were amongst the first bands to wear proto-corpse paint as part of their stage show, which featured hysterical ranting from a gargoyle-adorned pulpit, along with the use of a pyrotechnic exploding Bible which caused outrage amongst the clergy when it originally appeared in 1983. Although they were largely ignored by the media and record companies in the 1980s, their music became known through the underground tape trading phenomenon, and the band achieved a degree of cult status. In 2008 they reunited, and were signed by Nuclear Blast. Their first full-length album, Human Remains, was released in May 2011. The album topped at No. 46 on the German album chart in its first week of release. Biography=Early years (1982-1987) Hell was founded in 1982, in Derbyshire, England. They signed to the Belgian label Mausoleum Records, but two weeks prior to the recording of their debut album, the label collapsed into bankruptcy. Guitarist Kev Bower subsequently quit the band. He was briefly replaced by Sean Kelley, though Hell split up soon afterwards, which led to the suicide of vocalist Dave Halliday by carbon monoxide poisoning. Dave Halliday taught Andy Sneap (later to form heavy metal band Sabbat) to play guitar and Sneap mentions Hell as one of his main influences.METAL FORCES No 25, 15 August 1987 Sneap went on to become a world-renowned record producer, with over 100 albums and a Swedish Grammy Award to his credit. Reformation (2008-2011) The remaining original members of Hell reunited in 2008 to finally record their album which was entitled Human Remains. Sabbat members Martin Walkyier and Andy Sneap agreed to play on the album to replicate Dave Halliday's vocals and guitar tracks respectively, with Sneap also acting as the producer. Although Walkyier spent a few evenings (not the \\"several months\\" he often claims in frequent social media rants) recording test vocals for various songs on the album, this process was halted once it became clear that his vocal style and somewhat acerbic temperament were unsuitable for the task. Kev Bower's brother David (who is known as David Beckford in his career as a stage and television actor) was invited to do a voiceover for the song \\"Plague And Fyre\\" and then joined the band as lead vocalist, re-recording all the lead vocal parts. Sneap also joined the band as a permanent member. 2011 The new lineup played their first gig at the MFN club in Nottingham on 20 May 2011, playing songs from Human Remains and also Race Against Time's \\"Bedtime\\" as a tribute to David Halliday. This was followed by a run of festival shows in Europe and the UK, including Metalfest Open Airs in Switzerland, Germany and Austria, Rockstad Falun in Sweden, the UK's Download Festival, Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in Finland, Summer Breeze Open Air in Germany, and Bloodstock Open Air in the UK, for which they received the \\"2011 Best Mainstage Performance\\" vote. The band then performed on the Sweden Rock Cruise, and closed out 2011 by having Human Remains being awarded Sweden Rock Magazine's \\"2011 Album Of The Year\\", as well as attaining position No. 6 in the Metal Hammer \\"Best Of 2011\\" list. The album also attained \\"Best Of 2011\\" accolades on many internet webzines, as well as being nominated \\"2011 Album Of The Year\\" on the Bloodstock Open Air user forum. 2012 Hell opened their 2012 show run with a mainstage appearance at the Hammerfest in Prestatyn, North Wales. This was followed by the band gaining a prestigious support slot with Accept for the whole of their \\"Stalingrad\\" European tour, which started at Le Bataclan in Paris on 6 April. The band were also nominated for a Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards in the magazine's \\"Metal As F*ck\\" category. Numerous additional European shows were also played, including the Rock Hard Festival at the German Gelsenkirchen Amphitheatre, with this show being filmed and subsequently broadcast by WDR TV on the long- running Rockpalast mainstream TV show. Scandinavian shows included headlining appearances at the Muskelrock and Metal Magic festivals in Sweden and Denmark respectively, along with a Sweden Stage appearance at the Sweden Rock Festival. The band also featured in the July 2012 issue of the UK's Metal Hammer magazine, in which they appeared in a three-page article. Hell's 2012 tour run also included their first shows in Eastern Europe at the Masters of Rock festival in the Czech Republic and Metalcamp in Slovenia, along with appearances at the Alcatraz (BE), Zwarte Cross (NL), and Into The Grave (NL) festivals. They closed out the year with headlining appearances in Dublin (IRE), a town festival at Molins de Rei near Barcelona (ES), and played their final show of 2012 at Rommelrock in Maasmechelen (BE), thus completing the Human Remains tour run which had taken the band to 16 different countries. Hell also entered the studio late in the year to commence work on the follow- up album to Human Remains. 2013 By the beginning of 2013, Kev Bower and Andy Sneap had completed demo recordings for the majority of songs which would appear on the band's second album, with recording proper set to commence in the spring. Since no early demo recordings were this time available to fill a bonus disc, the band elected to record a live DVD as a bonus complement to the album, and this was shot and recorded at the band's first 2013 show at Derby Assembly Rooms (UK) on 23 February. The sell out event also unveiled the band's full Church Of Hell stage set and pyrotechnic show, with fans travelling from 13 different countries to attend. The band played a headline show at the R-Mine Metalfest (BE) and also appeared at Turock Open Air (DE), Hammer Open Air (FIN), Bang Your Head Open Air (DE) and made a return mainstage appearance at Bloodstock Open Air as one of the most heavily requested bands on the BOA user forum, and once again won the \\"Best Mainstage Performance\\" vote. It was later discovered that technical problems with the DVD recording at Derby had made some material unsalvageable, so additional footage was added from the band's appearance at this festival. It was announced in August that the second album would be entitled Curse and Chapter. To coincide with the album release, Hell were announced as being principal support for Amon Amarth and Carcass on the whole of their extensive European tour, taking in 25 shows in 13 countries, opening in Oberhausen (DE) on 7 November. 2014 The first three months of 2014 saw the band on a temporary hiatus as Andy Sneap had production commitments in the USA with Accept and Exodus. The first large-scale show of 2014 was announced as being at Hyde Park in London, playing alongside Black Sabbath. The band played a warm-up show to this event at The Rescue Rooms in Nottingham. Following a main slot at the Leyendas Del Rock event in Alicante (ES) and a W.E.T.Stage appearance the 2014 Wacken Open Air festival, Andy Sneap and Kev Bower took to the saddle for charity on behalf of the band, participating in a 260 km cycle ride from London to Download Festival to raise money for the NSPCC, the Teenage Cancer Trust and Nordoff Robbins. The band played a run of shows in Europe supporting Kreator and Arch Enemy, immediately followed by a UK tour supporting Saxon throughout November and December. On the eve of the show at Newcastle 02 Academy, however, Saxon's drummer Nigel Glockler was rushed to hospital with a brain aneurysm, resulting in the last five shows being postponed until February 2015. 2015 After completing the rescheduled run of shows with Saxon, the band made an additional UK appearance as special mainstage guests at Hammerfest 2015. This was an especially difficult show to complete, since Kev Bower was temporarily resident in Spain at the hospital bedside of his sick father, flying in for the show with almost no time to spare, and then having to leave again immediately afterwards. Once his father had recovered and was repatriated, the band then continued touring work throughout Europe, playing headline shows in Belgium, Holland and Germany, including headlining festival appearances at events including Metalheadz Open Air in Oberndorf, at which they used a rare opportunity to use the full stage show and pyrotechnic production. The band also made a return visit to the Sweden Rock Festival and played mainstage at Rockharz Open Air in Germany. On 5 August 2015 the band announced that after their penultimate live show of 2015 in Finland (Jalometalli), they would be starting work on their third studio album. The band closed out 2015 by accepting an invitation from their 2012 touring companions Accept to provide a special guest appearance at the London Forum on 7 December. 2016 The first three months of 2016 were spent almost exclusively in the studio, writing and rehearsing new material for the forthcoming album. This live-work hiatus was also created by the fact that for the third time in their career, the band found themselves signed to a booking agent who had then failed to secure any work for the band. This situation was resolved in March, when Hell joined the roster of Loudnoise Productions based in Holland. Musical style Hell are most often described as a NWOBHM band, although they strongly distance themselves from this movement, citing that the NWOBHM was already in rapid decline by the time the band actually formed. Their progressive musical style incorporates elements of thrash, power, symphonic, gothic, speed, doom and black metal, encompassing great variety, and with no two songs ever sounding exactly alike. Underlying lyrical themes in much Hell material focus on the occult and the darker sides of human nature. Typical themes include a distaste for organised religion, alien abduction, political imprisonment, mental illness, and historical events such as the Black Death and the Bubonic Plague. Although primarily guitar- driven, the band's sound is fleshed out by the use of keyboards and digital sampling to add depth and texture to the material. Their approach to song writing is often unorthodox, with numerous complex tempo, time signature and key changes, along with a signature series of atmospheric, theatrical interludes and introductions to their songs.

Career Alice Gertrude was a freight and passenger steamship built in 1898, either at Seattle, Washington, according to one source, or at Port Angeles. Washington, according to another source. The ship was built either by or for the brothers John Rex Thompson (1855‚Äì1926) and Fred Thompson ( ? ‚Äì ? ), who were prominent citizens of early Port Angeles doing business as the Thompson Steamboat Company. The Thompsons ran steamboats to Neah Bay from Port Angeles, and Alice Gertrude was built for this route. The vessel was named for two cousins, Alice Thompson, the daughter of Fred Thompson, and Gertrude Thompson, the daughter of John Rex Thompson.Clallam County Genealogical Society, Obituary Transcriptions for John Rex Thompson and Fred Thompson (accessed 04-30-11). On January 8, 1902, Captain J. Rex Thompson sold his interest in the Thompson Steamboat Company, which included Alice Gertrude and five other steam vessels, to the La Conner Trading and Transportation Company. In 1903, the La Conner Trading and Transportation Company merged with the Puget Sound Navigation Company (PSN), and Alice Gertrude became part of the PSN fleet. In 1904, Alice Gertrude and another PSN ship, Rosalie, ran on alternate days, six days a week, from Pier 1 in Seattle, which was at the foot of Yesler Street, for Port Townsend, Washington, and the ports on the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Rosalie‚Ä≤s route ended at Clallam, Washington, with Alice Gertrude proceeding further to Neah Bay. Wreck On January 11, 1907, under the command of Captain Charles Kalstrom (d. 1917), a well-known and popular captain, Alice Gertrude was wrecked while trying to enter Clallam Bay. Kalstrom, who had been on the route for 16 years, encountered a severe snowstorm at about 9:00 p.m. With visibility blocked, Kalstrom was putting the ship about, when at 10:15 p.m., the vessel struck ground on Clallam Reef. The passengers and crew remained on board until the morning, when, with the assistance of the steam tugs Lorne and Wyadda, they were all taken off. The steamer Rosalie took the passengers back to Port Angeles. The financial loss was valued at $40,000. Alice Gertrude broke up quickly and the only salvageable parts were the boiler and the engine, which were removed from the wreck by the steam cargo ship Rapid Transit. These components belonged to the marine insurance underwriter, but PSN repurchased them and they were installed in the steam fishing vessel Independent.

The novel building received widespread attention, with articles in national publications like Life and Popular Mechanics, and was the subject of a National Science Foundation-funded research project in the 1970s. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1985 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, only 33 years after it was built. History The firm of Bridgers & Paxton Consulting Engineers was founded in 1951 by Frank Bridgers (1922‚Äì2005) and Donald Paxton (1912‚Äì2007), both of whom were interested in the potential applications of solar energy. Initially operating out of a garage behind Bridgers' house, the two men conceived a new office building for their firm which would include an experimental solar heating system. They believed such a system would not only save money, but would also allow them to collect valuable data for future projects. In 1954, they were able to put some of their ideas into practice with an innovative heating and cooling system for the Simms Building, which took advantage of the building's south-facing glass curtain wall to provide solar heating in winter. However, additional heating or cooling was still required under most conditions. Bridgers and Paxton began serious design work on the Solar Building in early 1954, and it was constructed between March and August 1956. Stanley & Wright were the architects for the building. Its total cost was $58,500, of which the heating and cooling system made up about $15,000‚Äîroughly twice the cost of a conventional system. However, Bridgers and Paxton believed the reduced operating costs would save money in the long run. The novel building attracted considerable attention, receiving write-ups in a number of national publications including Architectural Forum, Life, Architectural Record, Progressive Architecture, and Popular Mechanics, and directly inspired a number of subsequent active solar heating systems. Despite some minor problems, the building's heating system operated successfully for six years, even during the particularly cold and cloudy month of January 1957, which recorded only three sunny days. However, it was not as economical as Bridgers and Paxton had hoped, mainly due to the extremely low cost of fuel at the time. When the building was expanded in 1962, the solar collector was abandoned in favor of a conventional boiler system, though the equipment was left intact for possible future use. This decision paid off just a few years later, when the 1973 oil crisis caused a renewed interest in solar energy and brought fresh attention to the Solar Building. In early 1974, Penn State researcher Stanley Gilman received a National Science Foundation grant to restore the building's solar heating system and operate it as part of a multi- year field study intended to identify optimal design criteria for such systems. Following the conclusion of the project, the solar heating system remained in use. Bridgers & Paxton eventually outgrew the building, moving to a new location in 1985. The Solar Building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1985 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The building was considered \\"exceptionally significant\\", justifying its inclusion in the National Register even though it was only 33 years old at the time. Architecture The Solar Building is a one-story, International Style building consisting of two main sections. The north wing, containing the main drafting room as well as the solar heating equipment, made up the main portion of the original building. It has an irregular quadrilateral cross-section with the roof and south wall both angled (at 20 and 30 degrees, respectively) in order to provide a high southern exposure for the solar collectors. The wing is framed by seven structural steel bents, spaced apart and filled in with wooden ceiling joists and masonry. The north wall has a narrow, continuous band of windows running just below the roofline which light the drafting room, while the street-facing eastern elevation is windowless brick. The south wing is a low, flat-roofed structure containing office space. It is partially faced with brick, marking the original extent of the building; it was later extended with an addition in 1962. The main entrance is positioned at the intersection of the two wings. Heating system The Truman St. elevation of the building, showing the location of the solar collectors (now covered) The building's active solar heating system employed an array of 56 solar thermal collectors with a total area of . The array was positioned on a south-facing exterior wall which was angled at 30 degrees to the vertical in order to catch the maximum amount of winter sunlight. The collectors were custom-fabricated aluminum panels with built-in flow channels for water to pass through. The surface of each collector was coated with low-reflectivity black paint and a layer of glass to capture the maximum amount of thermal energy. In sunny weather, water passing through the collectors would reach a maximum temperature of before being deposited in a 6,000-gallon insulated underground tank which provided a hot water reserve for up to three days of cloudy weather. Under normal conditions (about 90% of an average heating season), the water in the tank would be warm enough to directly heat the building by circulating it through radiant panels in the floor and ceiling. If the temperature in the tank dropped due to prolonged cloudy weather, a heat pump could be employed to maintain the hot water supply to the panels. The heat pump was a standard commercial water chiller unit, but with heating rather than cooling as its intended purpose‚Äîchilling the water in the tank and delivering the \\"waste\\" heat to the hot water stream. The heat pump could continue to function as long as the tank temperature remained above . In summer, the system could also provide cooling by circulating cold water through the building rather than hot water. In this mode, the storage tank became a reservoir for cold water, which allowed the system to save energy in milder weather by storing heat during the day and releasing it at night when the outside temperatures were lower. Most of the time, the water in the tank could be kept cool using only an evaporative cooler. If the water in the tank got too warm, the heat pump would go back into operation in order to continue transferring heat from the cold water stream into the tank. It was also possible to operate in cooling mode during the day while storing hot water from the solar collectors and heat pump to heat the building at night. Minor changes were made to the system during its operational life. One of the first problems that arose was corrosion of the collector panels, which originally had integral flow channels formed from two bonded sheets of aluminum. After leaks started to develop, the flow channels were replaced with copper tubing attached to the back of the panels. Gilman made additional modifications to the system in the 1970s, including changing the working fluid in the collector loop to ethylene glycol (in order to prevent freezing) and re-soldering the collector panels for better thermal contact. Gilman also installed an automated control system and upgraded the air handling equipment to allow individual temperature control for each office. Despite the modifications, the system remains mostly intact as originally designed.

Napster, Inc. was a 2000 U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California case that focused on copyright infringement, racketeering, and unlawful use of digital audio interface devices. Metallica vs. Napster, Inc. was the first case that involved an artist suing a peer-to- peer file sharing (\\"P2P\\") software company. Background Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. Napster was a pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing Internet service, founded by Shawn Fanning, that emphasized sharing digitally encoded music as MP3 audio files. On April 13, 2000, Metallica filed a lawsuit against the file sharing company Napster. Metallica alleged that Napster was guilty of copyright infringement and racketeering, as defined by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. This case was filed soon after another case was filed against Napster, the A&M; Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., which included 18 large record companies. Metallica v. Napster, Inc. was the first highly publicized instance of an artist suing a P2P software company, and encouraged several other high-profile artists to sue Napster. Case  On July 11, 2000, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich read testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee accusing Napster of copyright infringement. He explained that, that year, Metallica discovered that a demo of \\"I Disappear\\", a song set to be released with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was being played on the radio. Metallica traced the leak to a file on Napster's peer-to-peer file-sharing network, where the band's entire catalogue was available for free download. Metallica argued that Napster was enabling users to exchange copyrighted MP3 files.Marshall L. (2002, April 5) Metallica and Morality: The Rhetorical Battleground of the Napster Wars. Pg. 8 Metallica sought a minimum of $10 million in damages, at a rate of $100,000 per illegally downloaded song. Metallica hired NetPD, an online consulting firm, to monitor the Napster service. NetPD produced a list of 335,435 Napster users who were allegedly sharing the band's songs online in violation of copyright laws; the 60,000-page list was delivered to Napster's office. Metallica demanded that their songs be banned from file sharing, and that the users responsible for sharing their music be banned from the service. This led to over 300,000 users being banned from Napster, although software was released that simply altered the Windows registry and allowed users to rejoin the service under a different name. The lawsuit also named several universities to be held accountable for allowing students to illegally download music on their networks, including the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Indiana University. Outcome In March 2001, the federal district court judge ruling over the case, Marilyn Hall Patel, issued a preliminary injunction in Metallica's favor pending the case's resolution. The injunction, which was substantially identical to one ordered in the A&M; case, ordered Napster to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. Napster was forced to search its system and remove all copyrighted songs by Metallica. Other artists including Dr. Dre, a number of record companies, and the RIAA subsequently filed their own lawsuits which led to the termination of an additional 230,142 Napster accounts. On July 12, 2001 Napster reached a settlement with Metallica and Dr. Dre after Bertelsmann AG BMG became interested in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94 million. The settlement required that Napster block music being shared from any artist that did not want their music to be shared. This $94 million deal was blocked when Judge Peter Walsh ruled that the deal was tainted because Napster Chief Executive Officer Konrad Hilbers, a former Bertelsmann executive, had one foot in the Napster camp and one foot in the Bertelsmann camp. Napster was forced to file for Chapter 7 and liquidate its assets. Napster The Napster program was originally a way for nineteen-year-old Shawn Fanning and his friends throughout the country to trade music in the MP3 format. Fanning and his friends decided to try to increase the number of files available and involve more people by creating a way for users to browse each other‚Äôs files and to talk to each other. Napster went live in September 1999 and gained instant popularity. Napster‚Äôs number of registered users was doubling every 5‚Äì6 weeks. In February 2001, Napster had roughly 80 million monthly users compared to Yahoo‚Äôs 54 million monthly users. At its peak Napster facilitated nearly 2 billion file transfers per month and had an estimated net-worth of between 60-80 million dollars. Fanning designed Napster as a searching and indexing program, meaning that files were not downloaded from Napster‚Äôs servers but rather from a peer‚Äôs computer. Users had to download a program, MusicShare, which would allow them to interact with Napster‚Äôs servers. When users would log onto their Napster account, MusicShare would read the names of the MP3 files that the user had made public and would then communicate with Napster‚Äôs servers so a complete list of all public files from all users could be compiled. Once logged into Napster a user would simply enter the name of the file they wanted to download and hit the search button to view a list of all the sources that contained the desired file. The user would then click the download button and the Napster server would communicate with the host's MusicShare browser to facilitate a connection and begin the download. This method of file sharing is referred to as peer-to-peer file sharing. P2P Peer-to-peer is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between cooperating users. By joining one of these peer-to-peer network of nodes, the users allow a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, to be directly available to other network participants. By utilizing this type of application structure, any MP3s, videos, or other files located on a users' computer are instantly made available to other Napster users for download. This is one of the major reasons Napster was so popular, it was easy to use and had a large number of files for download. Being one of the first of its kind, Napster made a significant contribution to the popularity of the peer-to-peer application structure. Many other software applications followed in Napster's footsteps by using this model including BearShare, Gnutella, Freenet, and today's major application of torrents including BitTorrent. Issues surrounding P2P software One of the largest issues with P2P software is the public assumption that users use these programs strictly for illegally copying of copyrighted files. There are many other issues associated with P2P software. Some file sharing clients have been known to release confidential personal information, and come bundled with spyware, malware, or other viruses that could enable unsecure, unsigned codes to allow remote access to any file on the user's computer. Artists using P2P for promotion The relationship between music artists and P2P file sharing software is not always about infringing music. In a 2000 study, it was shown that users of Napster who download free music actually spent more money on music. In another study, it was proposed that by downloading free music, users are able to sample new music and find new tastes, which may lead to increased sales. Several artists also supported Napster and used the service for promotion. In 2000, Limp Bizkit signed a $1.8 million deal to promote 23 free concerts. Implications There were many people that were worried that the ruling in the Napster v. Metallica case would affect the future of P2P file sharing and other industries that stemmed from the growing popularity of MP3 music. In RIAA v. Diamond, the Recording Industry Association of America sued Diamond Multimedia Systems for producing a portable MP3 player called the Rio. The RIAA claimed that the Rio did not comply with the Audio Home Recording Act (AHRA), and thus its production should be halted. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Rio was not covered by the AHRA and that it was designed simply to enable users to easily listen to MP3 files that were already stored on their personal computers or on other personal storage devices. In the earlier case of Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., it was ruled that Sony's VCR, which allowed users to record live television onto cassette tapes to be viewed at a later time, did not violate copyright law.

Description Eucalyptus porosa is a mallee that typically grows to a height of , or a tree to , and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous or flaky, greyish bark on the trunk or stems, smooth whitish or grey bark above. Young plant and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to lance- shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded or slightly beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs between October and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus porosa was first formally described in 1856 by Friedrich Miquel from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. Miquel's description was published in the journal Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief. The specific epithet (porosa) is from the Latin porosus meaning \\"pierced with small holes\\", referring to small holes in the anthers. Distribution and habitat Mallee box is widely distributed in the semi-arid regions of South Australia, north- western Victoria and south-western New South Wales. It grows in a variety of habitats including rocky ridges, coastal limestone, mallee shrubland and woodland.

It made recordings, and appeared on radio and television and in film. It consisted of singers with vocal ranges from high soprano to contralto, one of whom would also play piano accompaniment. At various times, it had six or seven members. Despite the name, it seems never to have included any sisters.  History  The history of the group is poorly documented. It may have been founded in Vienna by Edmund Fritz (also known as a movie actor and director); possibly in the late 1920s; certainly by 1930, when it made its first recordings. In the group's early days, it was called Edmund Fritz's Singing Babies. In March 1930, a playlist records that the group performed on a German radio programme Funkstunde. In May 1930, the group recorded four songs for Electrola, which were released on two 78 rpm singles. In September and October 1930, it recorded four more songs for Electrola, unreleased at the time and thought to be lost. Also in 1930, Fritz starred in the German short film Die Singenden Babies (English: The Singing Babies), apparently lost. The title suggests that the group may have appeared in the film, but it is not known whether or not they did. In 1931, the group recorded four songs in Milan for Columbia Records, three of which had Italian titles. The same year, it gave a radio concert in the Netherlands. Also in 1931, the group appeared in the Otto Preminger film Die Gro√üe Liebe, under the name Die Singing Babies von Edmund Fritz. In 1932, the group appeared in the film Baby, starring Anny Ondra, in which it performed the songs \\"Ich lieb' dich, I love you, je t'aime\\" and \\"Auf Wiederseh'n Baby\\". Recordings of the former song, and of a French version of the latter under the title \\"Au revoir Baby\\", were released. Those recordings were credited to Singing Babies, suggesting that the group was no longer associated with Fritz, who does not appear in the group's later story; the reason for that is not known. In 1933, the group recorded six songs in London, under the name Viennese Seven Singing Sisters. In 1934, it appeared in the film Annette in Paradise (AKA Ein Kuss nach Ladenschluss), credited as Singing Babies. In March 1934, according to the recollection of Werner Doege of the Harmony Boys, the group toured Switzerland. In February 1935, according to the magazine A Noite, the group performed at the Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro, Argentina. In March 1935, it recorded two songs in Milan. In 1936, the group appeared in the Brazilian film Noches carioca. In 1937 and 1938, the group appeared in two short films made by British Path√©: The Coconut GroveCabaret Time After Midnight (soundtrack lost) (The Coconut Grove was a London nightclub), and Viennese Singing Sisters. British Path√© have uploaded the song \\"Memories of Chopin\\" from Viennese Singing Sisters to their YouTube channel; the group then contained only six members. \\"Memories of Chopin\\" is a vocal arrangement, in German, of Chopin's √âtude Op. 10, No. 3 in E flat for solo piano. In 1938, the group toured Argentina. In SeptemberNovember 1938, the group appeared in three episodes of the BBC Television programme Cabaret; in the first as The Viennese Singing Sisters, and in the other two as The Six Viennese Singing Sisters. In November 1938, the group gave a 20-minute performance broadcast by two BBC regional radio stations, as The Viennese Singing Sisters. By early 1939, the group had disbanded. Some of them were Jewish, or were married to Jews. In 1938, Austria was incorporated into Nazi Germany by the Anschluss, and they could no longer safely perform there. Some members relocated to Argentina, some to the United States of America. In the 1940s, some of the members who had relocated to Argentina formed a group called Singing Babies, and toured Argentina and Bolivia. That group may have contained only two or three of the original members.. A history of the group was published in 2015 by Karsten Lehl, Wolfgang Schneidereit, Andreas Wellen, Josef Westner: Die Singing Babies. Eine Spurensuche.

His best known work is St√¶rekassen, an extension to the Royal Danish Theatre on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. Biography Holger Jacobsen was born on 30 October 1876 in Odense. He apprenticed as a carpenter and furthered his studies at Odense Technical School before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1898 to 1905 where he was a pupil of Hans J√∏rgen Holm for whom he also worked as an assistant. After his graduation he worked abroad for a couple of years, and was influenced by the Mannerism and Baroque architecture which he saw in France, Spain and Italy. Another source of inspiration was Vilhelm Wanscher's lectures on Michelangelo. He later described himself as the \\"last Italian in Danish architecture\\". Jacobsen had his breakthrough with Bispebjerg Crematorium which was built from 1905 to 1906. Another early work was Taastrup New Church (1907) which was inspired by the architecture of northern Italy but in its details and interiors shows Jugendstil influences. He also undertook the rebuilding of the Circus Building in Copenhagen after it was devastated by fire in 1914 and led the completion of the new Copenhagen Police Headquarters (1922‚Äì24) after Hack Kampmann's death. In 1925, Jacobsen published a proposal for an extension to the Royal Danish Theatre which had been suffering from lack of space ever since its inauguration in 1874. He was rewarded with the C. F. Hansen Medal the same year and when an architectural competition was held he won it with a modified entry which included two extra stories with facilities for the new National Danish Broadcasting Company. The building, which became known as the Nesting Box, was met with strong criticism, especially by Poul Henningsen and his consorts in the influential magazine Critical Review. From its opening in 1931, it was also challenged in terms of functionality. His later works consists of mainly residential and some office buildings.

It was situated in Clitherall, Minnesota‚Äîthe location of its one and only branch‚Äîand remained identical to its parent organization in all respects save leadership. Following Fletcher's death, his few remaining adherents elected to reunite with the main Cutlerite body, and this sect ceased to exist. History The True Church of Jesus Christ originated from a schism between the two existing congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ in 1953, following the death of church president Emory Fletcher. Though precipitated by a dispute over who should succeed Fletcher in the presidential office, the division was exacerbated by the differing conditions under which each congregation had operated during the first half of the twentieth century. Prior to 1920, there had only been one Cutlerite congregation, located in Clitherall. However, during the early 1920s, a majority of the Cutlerite congregation elected to relocate to Independence, Missouri near the Temple Lot, where they purchased land and erected a building which became their new church headquarters. Independence was an urban environment, in sharp contrast to rural Clitherall. According to Rupert Fletcher, president of the Cutlerite church from 1958 to 1974 and author of Alpheus Cutler and the Church of Jesus Christ, the schism that led to the founding of Clyde Fletcher's church was precipitated by what he called \\"the lack of communication and a wide difference in environment.\\" Whereas the Minnesota congregation were primarily \\"members of a rural society, engaged in agrarian pursuits,\\" the Missouri members lived and worked \\"in an urban community.\\" \\"The problems and needs of each have little in common with the other\\", wrote Fletcher, and this had often \\"caused disunity.\\" Matters came to a head in April 1955, when Erle Whiting was elected by the Independence congregation (which held the majority of Cutlerites) to succeed Emory Fletcher. While the Independence church asserted that this was in keeping with Cutlerite tradition‚Äîwhich passed the office of Church President down to the predecessor's First Counselor‚Äîthe Minnesota group insisted that Clyde Fletcher was the legitimate President. Fletcher excommunicated the leaders of the Missouri congregation for refusing to follow his leadership. The Missouri Culterites refused to accept this act as legitimate, or Fletcher's election to the presidency by a minority of the total Cutlerite membership. Fletcher subsequently insisted that his was the sole true continuation of Alpheus Cutler's organization, and began styling his church the \\"True Church of Jesus Christ.\\" The two congregations fought over various church properties in and around Clitherall. In 1966, a Minnesota court ruled that the Missouri group was the legitimate Cutlerite church, and was entitled to exclusive control over all church properties and records, including the Clitherall meetinghouse. Prior to this ruling, the meetinghouse had been serving as Fletcher's church headquarters and sole branch. Following Fletcher's death in 1969, the remaining members of his organization reunited with the Independence church, and the True Church of Jesus Christ ceased to exist. The old Cutlerite meetinghouse in Clitherall still stands, and remains the property of the Independence church. Doctrines The True Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) followed all of the distinctive teachings of the main Cutlerite organization, including adherence to the United Order and belief in Baptism for the Dead and a Nauvoo-era Temple Endowment. As in the mainline Cutlerite church, polygamy and eternal marriage were rejected. The church utilized the same scriptures utilized by the Cutlerite church in Independence. Factional breakdown: Cutlerite sectsMedia *Meetinghouse of the True Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), located in Clitherall, Minnesota. Constructed by the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) in 1912, it was used by Fletcher's sect, but was never the legal property of that organization. Owned by the Independence Cutlerite church.

The Montmartre paintings are a group of works that Vincent van Gogh made in 1886 and 1887 of the Paris district of Montmartre while living there, at 54 Rue Lepic, with his brother Theo. Rather than capture urban settings in Paris, van Gogh preferred pastoral scenes, such as Montmartre and Asni√®res in the northwest suburbs. Of the two years in Paris, the work from 1886 often has the dark, somber tones of his early works from the Netherlands and Brussels. By the spring of 1887, van Gogh embraced use of color and light and created his own brushstroke techniques based upon Impressionism and Pointillism. The works in the series provide examples of his work during that period of time and the progression he made as an artist. Background=Paris In 1886, van Gogh left the Netherlands for Paris and the guidance of his brother Theo van Gogh who was an art dealer. While he had been influenced not only by the great Dutch masters but also to a considerable extent by his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve a Dutch realist painter and a leading member of the Hague School. coming to Paris meant that he would also have the opportunity to be influenced by Impressionists, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese art. His circle of friends included Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin and √âmile Bernard. Montmartre Montmartre, sitting on a butte overlooking Paris, was known for its bars, cafes, and dance-hall. It was also located on the edge of countryside that afforded Van Gogh the opportunity to work on paintings of rural settings while living in Paris. Artistic style When Van Gogh painted he intended not just to capture the subject, but to express a message or meaning. It was through his paintings of nature that he was most successful at accomplishing his goal. It also created a great challenge: how to portray the subject and create a work that would resonate with the audience. Works=Montmartre scenes The Boulevard de Clichy (F292), a street in Montmartre, played an important role in van Gogh's life in Paris. The Caf√© du Tambourin was located there, a restaurant just around the corner from the apartment where he lived with his brother Theo. There van Gogh met with other artists and displayed some of his works. He had a relationship with the owner of the establishment, Agostina Segatori, who was also the subject in one of his paintings Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Caf√© du Tambourin. Located on the boulevard was the studio of Fernand Cormon, where van Gogh received training, as well as the Moulin Rouge and the homes of several of his friends, who he referred to as \\"Impressionistes du Petit Boulevard\\": John Russell, Georges-Pierre Seurat and Paul Signac. The painting of the Boulevard is Impressionistic in terms of subject and technique. Van Gogh used short brush strokes to depict the figures of the people and the buildings. Light is reflected off the road. Capturing a moment in a street scene was a common theme for Impressionists. The vantage point for the painting was looking northwest from Place Blanche. Rue Lepic's entrance is on the right side of the painting. Van Gogh also made a drawing of this site from a greater distance.

In van Gogh‚Äôs first year in Paris he painted rural areas around Montmartre, such as the butte and its windmills. The colors are somber and evoke a sense of his anxiety and loneliness. The landscape and windmills around Montmartre were the source of inspiration for a number of van Gogh's paintings. The Moulin de la Galette, still standing, is located near the apartment he shared with his brother. Built in 1622, it was originally called Blute-Fin and belonged to the Debray family in the 19th century. Van Gogh met artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Signac and Paul Gauguin who inspired him to incorporate Impressionism into his artwork resulting in lighter, more colorful paintings. Windmills also featured in some of van Gogh's landscape paintings of Montmartre.

The apartment where he lived with his brother bordered the countryside and overlooked the city of Paris. At the time the painting was made, the country landscape was beginning to disappear as a result of the city's expansion. Soon the fields, pastures and windmills would largely disappear from the Montmartre area. Van Gogh draws the audience in by use of the diagonal line of fences to the windmill just right of the center of the picture. This technique also established depth in the work.

Vegetable Gardens in Montmartre: La Butte Montmartre (F346) depicts the changing landscape of the Montmartre landscape. In the foreground are allotted vegetable gardens with people working in their allotments. Although still somewhat rural, a large apartment building is constructed in the fields. The three remaining windmills in the area had now become a source of entertainment and respite from working in the city. Le Blute-Fin, also called Le Moulin de la Galette was the largest standing mill offering a caf√© and a terraced viewing platform for looking over Paris from behind the mill. Between the mills are dining establishments and dance halls. He used techniques he picked up from the Impressionists and Pointillists, such as use of short brush strokes or dots of color. The colors are much brighter than the somber colors he used in the Netherlands. Vegetable Gardens in Montmartre: La Butte Montmartre (F316), the same name as painting F346, was selected by Van Gogh for his first exhibition in 1888 in Paris. Both paintings reflect how much he had learned since he came to Paris and were made on the same hill. The summery landscape depicts the vegetable gardens with the city skyline in the distance. Van Gogh was pleased with his work on this painting, commenting that it \\"breathed fresh air and joy\\".

Located above the city of Paris, the apartment afforded him a beautiful view of the city skyline, which he painted several times. Two of the paintings were made in 1887. The second painting View from Vincent's window was made from a similar vantage point to the titled painting View of Paris from Vincent's Room in the Rue Lepic of this article. In View of Paris (F341) van Gogh demonstrates several Neo-impressionist techniques. To bring an intensity to his work, he uses complementary colors of red and green. He adapted the stippling technique, using tiny dots in areas where needed for detail and brush strokes for the background.

She is a Thai politician and former member of the House of Representatives who served in the House from 2001 to 2005. Business Thailand's female population constitutes 47% of the country's workforce, the highest percentage of working women in the Asia- Pacific region. However, these women are also confronted by hiring discrimination and gender inequality in relation to wages due to being \\"concentrated in lower-paying jobs\\". Marriage According to the National Statistical Office of Thailand, female Thais marry at an earlier age than male Thais, and 24% of Thai households have women identified as \\"heads of households\\". Thailand outlawed marital rape in 2007. The evolution of women's rights In Thailand, women's rights according to labor laws require that men and women get paid for the amount of work they do. In 1974, Kanitha Wichiencharoen became a founder of The Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW), an association made up of both women and men, who campaigned to revise and amend laws to provide better protections for women and children. In the 1977 constitution of Thailand women were required to receive equal rights and protections. However, some inequalities remain in the law. There are no laws prohibiting women from holding office however there are very few women holding office. The biggest problem for gender inequality is when it comes domestic violence and trafficking. Sexual harassment became illegal in 1998, but there are few reported cases and very few that are prosecuted because of the difficulties involved in proving a case. Domestic laws are still to be enacted in the constitution and the requirement for evidence of domestic abuse makes it nearly impossible to prosecute. Traditionally, a girl's education took place mostly in the home, coupled with domestic chores, while boys usually went to a Buddhist monastery for education. Education overall for business and careers is lacking in Southeast Asia.Thailand Culture http://www.everyculture.com/SaTh/Thailand.html See also *Sex trafficking of women and children in Thailand *Thai people *Thailand women's national handball team *Thailand women's national rugby union team *Thailand women's national football team *Thailand national women's cricket team *Thailand women's national volleyball team *Violence against women in Thailand ReferencesFurther reading *Macan-Markar, Marwaan.

It is located north of Melbourne near Nagambie and Whroo. History The Angustown School, also known as Bailieston North School, operated from 1889 to 1903. The school was located near Reedy Lake and close to a sawmill operated by local entrepreneur Angus Cameron, who gave the district its name. The school was placed there at the request of Mr Cameron. The families of the men he employed had 40 children, so he asked that a school be provided for them. A report by inspector Samuel Ware dated December 28, 1888, describes most of the parents as working at Cameron's mill plus \\"two have small selections near the sawmill, but they depend for their livelihood on it.\\" He wrote that 12 children of school age lived within two miles of the school, with 12 others being aged between three and six. Mr Ware said the children of the district would be unable to attend other schools. Whroo was six miles distant. The nearest school, Bailieston, was 3.5 miles away in a straight line without roads and the \\"intervening space is often flooded.\\" The inspector recommended against purchasing a site for the proposed school at Angustown, and noted that Mr Cameron had promised to erect a suitable building. The department agreed if accommodation could be found for the teacher. It paid Cameron one shilling a year rent for the land on which the school, originally known as Bailieston North, was built. The school opened on May 16, 1889, with Elizabeth Moss as head teacher. Its average attendance that year was 18. Angustown School, c1900 In June 1889, inspector Dean reported: \\"The building has been erected by the residents. It is constructed of hardwood, with the exception of the floor. It has no ceiling and is not lined. No fireplace or chimney has been built, and as the winter threatens to be a severe one, I recommend that an iron chimney be sent at once. I think Mr A.

There was a physics primer, easel, stove and two blackboards. By March 1902 the school's condition had deteriorated and the department had little interest in maintaining it given declining enrolments. A letter from the teacher, M. Barrie, dated March 10, 1902, said that when she returned after the Christmas break she found the water tank to be poisoned (a dead bird being the cause). Someone had removed the pipe to get water because the tap was in the schoolroom. \\"I had to go to the expense of having it emptied,\\" Miss Barrie wrote. She was advised the expense would have to be paid for out of her maintenance allowance, which she disputed. Her complaints continued on September 12, 1902, when she wrote: \\"I wish to say that the building is a very poor one. In winter it is very cold and in the summer very hot. At all times very draughty. If it were lined with weatherboards and a fireplace put in it would be very comfortable. \\"It is almost impossible to keep it clean and all the pictures are spoilt either with the rain, or the smoke from the stove. In my opinion it would cost a great deal to put in proper order.\\" The school closed in 1903 and the remaining pupils transferred to Whroo.Education Department school building file, Public Record Office Victoria The site today There are no visible signs remaining of the school.

It is associated with a deficiency of Thromboxane-A synthase, which produces Thromboxane A2. Although this disease is like Camurati‚ÄìEngelmann disease where there is also diaphyseal dysplasia, there are, however, reasons to differentiate between the two diseases. As mentioned earlier, both diseases affect diaphysis, but Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia, affects both the diaphysis, and metaphyses. Also, Camurati‚ÄìEngelmann disease has no sign of defective haematopoiesis, but Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia is associated with a hematological abnormality. This is a rare disease and was characterized in 1988 by Ghosal in several children with anemia and bony dysplasia. Later, in 2008, there was a discovery that a mutation in the gene TBXAS1 cause some of the distinct features in this disease such as increased bone density. Most cases are found in India and the Middle East area, likely meaning a shared gene pool.  History  There were five patients in early childhood had two significant symptoms of the disease characterized today as Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia. The two symptoms described were thick long bones of the extremities with features of diaphyseal dysplasia and anemia that was not responsive to hematinics. Broadening of the long bones, specifically in the diaphyses, is usually thought of as Englemann disease, but patients showed both diaphyses and the metaphyses to be affected. This minor detail when it comes to Englemann disease is essential because there is a consistent mention of the metaphyses of the long bones to have been unaffected. Even though some patients suffering from Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia had difficulty walking, this is not a consistent symptom found with people affected by the disease, even though it is a crucial characteristic of Englemann disease. Some patients had low hemoglobin values suffering from Englemann disease. Anemia is a consistent feature of Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia with the severity of said anemia to include multiple blood transfusions. The gene responsible for Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia is likely TBXAS1. A genome-wide study was done on two families with the disease found that the likely culprits lie on the 7q33-34 chromosome. The region is made of the TBXAS1 gene, which is associated with bleeding disease, BRAF, which is associated with cancers, and ATP6VoA4, which is associated with renal distal tubular acidosis with sensorineural hearing loss. One year later, in 2008, the mutation in the TBXAS1 gene was found to be the gene responsible for the disease. However, this means that since TBXAS1 encodes for the enzyme Thromboxane-A synthase, there are yet to be known functions of this enzyme when it comes to bone remolding.  Symptoms  People suffering from this disease often have varying degrees of the following symptoms. People with the disease often have overall inflammation with skeletal symptoms that could include increased bone density associated with dysplasia. Specifically, the extremities are especially thick and long; bones can be seen with wide diaphyseal medullary cavities. Most early manifestations of this disease are bowing of the legs and forearms with general weakness of the legs. The bowing of the legs is usually seen in adolescence, with the child often taking longer than average to walk. The increased bone density manifests with the skull with general widening of diploic space. Also, a thickened skull base suggests diaphyseal dysplasia, which can lead to sclerosis of the base of the skull. When it comes to blood, most symptoms can be summarized as defective hematopoiesis. It is speculated that this is due to the metadiaphyseal dysplasia of the long bones and fibrosis or sclerosis of the bone marrow. The symptoms can include corticosteroid-sensitive anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypocellular bone marrow, and myelofibrosis. The key symptom here is progressive anemia, and symptoms like thrombocytopenia or leukopenia may be present with varying degrees of penetrance between patients.  Causes  Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder due to a mutation in both copies of the TBXAS1 gene on chromosome 7q34. The TBXAS1 gene codes for the enzyme Thromboxane-A synthase. When known patients with the disease were sequenced for the TBXAS1 gene they had a homozygous missense mutation. The TBXAS1 gene mainly transcribes in cells involved with the skeletal system and muscular system. The increased bone density is due to lopsidedness between bones forming and bone resorption. This enzyme has a couple of essential functions in the body that, if removed, could lead to the symptoms observed with the disease. Thromboxane-A synthase is responsible for platelet aggregation and the regulation of bone mineral density. Thromboxane-A synthase regulates bone mineral density by influencing the two genes TNFSF‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ and TNFSF‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅB, which encode for RANKL and osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor in osteoblasts, so if the regulation did not occur it consequently leads to sclerosis. Even though Thromboxane-A synthase is important for platelet aggregation it is important to note that patients with this disease do not suffer from any bleeding problems. The refractory anemia also called corticosteroid sensitive anemia, is likely due to fibrotic scarring or sclerosis, which is the stiffening of the tissue when organ-specific tissue is replaced with connective tissue. Thromboxane-A synthase also participants in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, which has effects on the prostaglandin E2 levels. A decrease in Thromboxane-A synthase leads to an increase in prostaglandin E2 levels which may affect erythroid precursor cells by suppressing them which likely leads to refractory anemia. There are still unanswered questions about the effect of a compromised TBXAS1 gene function and its affect in Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia.  Treatment  Blood transfusions can treat the low levels of hemoglobin in patients, but symptoms usually come back in irregular intervals. A consistent treatment most patients receive is a low-dose corticosteroid treatment, with a range between 0.1 mg/kg/day to 1.5 mg/kg/day to maintain hemoglobin and white blood cells at normal levels in the blood throughout life. The intervention of corticosteroid treatment is effective because patients can maintain healthy hemoglobin levels without the need for blood transfusions. After steroid therapy, anemia and most hematological abnormalities resolved themselves after a couple of weeks. This disease must be identified early because the progression of some of the symptoms can be slowed down, and other signs of the disease can even be cured. Even the more severe symptoms of the disease like the increase in bone density can be slowed. Some people treated early with the condition can achieve a healthy weight with thinning of dysplastic diaphysis to being close to normal. Walking abnormalities usually clear up with no signs of difficulty walking.

Features  Ch supports the 1999 ISO C Standard (C99) and C++ classes. It is a superset of C with C++ classes. Several major features of C99 are supported, such as complex numbers, variable length arrays (VLAs), IEEE-754 floating-point arithmetic, and generic mathematical functions. The specification for wide characters in Addendum 1 for C90 is also supported. C++ features available in Ch include: * Member functions * Mixed code and declaration * The this -> pointer * Reference type and pass-by-reference * Function-style type conversion * Classes * Private/public data and functions in classes. Ch is compatible with C++ in that by default, members of a class definition are assumed to be private until a 'public' declaration is given * Static member of class/struct/union * Const member functions * The new and delete operators * Constructors and destructors * Polymorphic functions * The scope resolution operator :: * The I/O functions cout, cerr, and cin with endl * Arguments for variadic functions are optional Ch supports classes in C++ with added abilities, including: * Classes inside member functions * Nested functions with classes * Passing member function to argument of pointer-to-function type of functions Ch can interact with existing C/C++ libraries and call C/C++ functions from Ch script. As a C/C++ interpreter, Ch can be used as a scripting engine and extension language for applications. Pointers to arrays or variables can be passed and shared in both C-compiled and Ch scripting contexts. One example of an embedded Ch scripting application is Mobile-C, which has been used for collaborative visualization of distributed mesh model. Ch has a built-in string type (string_t) for automatic memory allocation and de-allocation. It supports shell aliases, history, piping, etc. Ch has built-in 2D/3D graphical plotting features and computational arrays for numerical computing. A 2D linear equation of the form b = A*x can be written verbatim in Ch.

The public transportation hub and mass-market retail district Cinco y Diez are located in La Mesa. Don Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos statue in Morelos Park Barrio Chino La Mesa Barrio Chino is a Chinese enclave and home to 15,000 ethnic Chinese immigrants as of 2012, a number that has tripled from about 5,000 in 2009. The enclave is the second largest in Tijuana after the American expatriate enclave. The mayor of Tijuana had received negative publicity from the local newspapers for his support for the official establishment of the \\"Barrio Chino\\" as there is general negative sentiment from locals who view China as a major rival for trade with the United States. There are various official events held during the summer recognizing the area in Tijuana's La Mesa District. Tijuana's Chinese community started around the late 1800s to the early 1900s when the Chinese immigrants to the United States fled California during a period called the \\"yellow peril\\". As Tijuana was a border town, it was an important city towards the establishment of the Mexicali's Chinese community, which at the time, would outnumber Mexicans 2 to 1. Though the numbers were far fewer in Tijuana, thousands would come through Tijuana on their way to Ensenada and Mexicali, a journey usually by foot for 120 miles to the east. By the 1920s, the Chinese numbering around 15,000 would concentrate in Mexicali to avoid the Mexican civil war. Racism would keep the population small for many decades until the early 2000s when Aeromexico would start flying from Mexico City to Tokyo, Japan with a stop in Tijuana (thus creating a direct flight from Tijuana to Japan). In 2008, the airline started flying from Mexico City to Shanghai with a stop in Tijuana, thus creating a direct link from Tijuana to China. The author has attributed the immigrant Chinese population rise to the direct flight, where there were 5,000 Chinese immigrants in 2009 and 15,000 by 2012. In 2012, the Chinese community started making the enclave known, whereas the community largely kept to itself in years prior. The Chinatown is one of the few recent Chinatowns that was not created from commercial ventures.

The book's full title was Songs of the Great Dominion: Voices from the Forests and Waters, the Settlements and Cities of Canada.William Douw Lighthall, Songs of the Great Dominion: Voices from the Forests and Waters, the Settlements and Cities of Canada (Walter Scott [Windsor Series], 1889), Google Books, Web, Apr. 30, 2011. The collection was selected and edited by William Douw Lighthall of Montreal. It was published in London, England by the firm of Walter Scott, as part of its \\"Windsor Series\\" of anthologies.Michael Gnarowski, \\"Songs of the Great Dominion\\", Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton:Hurtig, 1988), 2047. The book introduced Canadian and English audiences to a new generation of Canadian writers. It marked the first publication in book form for several poets, including Bliss Carman, Pauline Johnson, and Duncan Campbell Scott. History Cover of 1889 edition Lighthall was asked to put together an anthology for Walter Scott by poet William Sharp, who was working as an editor for the firm. Independently, freelance editor Ernest Rhys made the same proposal on behalf of Walter Scott to Canadian poet Charles G.D. Roberts. When the mixup was revealed, Roberts withdrew, but promised Lighthall \\"whatever assistance you might permit me to be.\\" Roberts suggested several writers for inclusion, including his cousin Barry Straton and his sister Elizabeth (both of whom were included).John Coldwell Adams, \\"The Whirligig of Time,\\" Confederation Voices, Canadian Poetry, UWO, Web, Apr. 30, 2011. \\"Supplied with a ringing introduction which echoes with patriotic sentiment and lyrical praise for Canada,\\" says the Canadian Encyclopedia, \\"this is a collection of confident poetry truly representative of the national and literary self-respect of the emergent Dominion.\\" In his introduction, Lighthall was lavish in his praise of Roberts. \\"The foremost name in Canadian song at the present day is that of Charles George Douglas Roberts,\\" he declared. Immediately after Roberts Lighthall talked of Charles Sangster, whom he called Canada's \\"first important national poet\\" and \\"a kind of Wordsworth.\\" Lighthall was also lavish in praising the reputation of Isabella Valancy Crawford, whose one book of poetry had failed to sell in 1884, and who had died neglected in 1887 (a \\"sad story of unrecognized genius and death,\\" as he put it). While gently mocking her title, Lighthall pronounced Crawford's book, Old Spookse's Pass, Malcolm's Katie, and Other Poems, to be \\"the most striking volume\\" of Canadian poetry after Roberts's, and \\"even more boldly new\\" than his. After her death, he added, \\"Miss Crawford's work was, in fact, seen to be phenomenal.\\" In a review of Songs of the Great Dominion in the September 28, 1889, Athen√¶um, Theodore Watts-Dunton singled out Pauline Johnson for special praise, calling her ‚Äúthe most interesting English poetess now living‚Äù and quoting her poem \\"In the Shadows\\" in full. Johnson (who had not yet published a book) considered this to be a big boost for her career, and felt herself \\"indebted\\" for the inclusion and the review.John Coldwell Adams, \\"Pauline Johnson,\\" Confederation Voices, Canadian Poetry, UWO, Web, Apr. 30, 2011. One person who was unhappy with the selection was William Wilfred Campbell. \\"I have been cruelly misrepresented by a willful choice of my poorest work,\\" Campbell wrote to a friend.\\" \\"The anthology is noteworthy for its attempt to include some French Canadian poetry in the appendix as well as some folksongs in translation, and for its recognition of a distinct Indian element in Canadian writing.\\" Walter Scott republished the anthology in 1892 under the title, Canadian Poems and Lays: Selections of native verse reflecting the seasons, legends, and life of the Dominion.\\"Canadian Poems and Lays,\\" Internet Archive, Web, May 10, 2011.

For part of its existence, Albion served as a beer delivery vessel for Washington state's Angeles Brewing and Malting Company. It was involved in a 1910 collision with the steamship Chippewa.  Career Albion was built at Coupeville, Washington by Capt. H.B. Lovejoy, who intended the vessel to be sold for service on the Yukon River according to one source or Cook Inlet according to another. Power was supplied by an innovative compound steam engine devised by R.D. Ross. According to a news report from 1910, Albion was actually taken up to Cook Inlet, but it was found that the headwaters of the inlet were too shallow to allow the vessel to operate, and so the ship was returned to Puget Sound. Albion was placed on the route from Seattle to Coupeville. Albion was the first steamer on the Seattle-Everett-Whidbey Island route. Lovejoy sold Albion to J.B. Treadwell in 1903, and he took the vessel on one trip to Cook Inlet in Alaska. In 1906, Albion was sold to the Merchants Transportation Company, a Tacoma firm. In 1907, Albion was sold again, this time to the Angeles Brewing and Malting Company, and in this capacity was engaged to haul cargos of beer from Port Angeles to Seattle and other cities, as well as haul freight and carry passengers to Port Angeles  Collision with Chippewa Chippewa circa 1910. Chippewa struck Albion full amidships at just about this angle. On August 2, 1910, at about 11:00, Albion was involved in a collision with the much larger, steel-hulled steamer Chippewa. At 906 gross tons, Chippewa was six times the size of Albion. Chippewa was coming from Bellingham, Washington to Seattle and had reached the West Point at the northern entrance to Elliott Bay when the collision occurred. Albion was then en route from Seattle to Port Angeles, and many of her passengers were asleep in cabins at the time of the collision. The pilot of Albion saw Chippewa but for some reason misunderstood Chippewas signals as to which way to turn to avoid collision. Chippewa blew two whistle blasts, which meant ‚Äúpass to port‚Äù but instead Albion turned the other way into Chippewas path. The steamer Vashonian was nearby on a parallel course with Chippewa and narrowly avoided being involved in the collision. The full force of Chippewa's steel bow stem struck the wooden-hulled Albion amidships square on. No one was killed, and all of Albions passengers were taken on board Chippewa. Albion was heavily damaged. Towed to the beach, Albion was nearly submerged at low tide. One of the passengers, identified as Mrs. William Smith, of Centralia, Washington, a mother with three small children on board, described the collision as follows: > The children were asleep in the berths, and I was lying awake, listening to > the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. > Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up > and looked out of the window. There was a big boat, bearing directly down on > us. She blew four times and began to back. But still she came ahead towards > us, and I could see she was going to cut into us. I don't know what I > thought or did. I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went > slowly, but still so fast. Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. > The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing > timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. To add > to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. The > cries of my little boys and girl. The children were bruised by the > collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other > personal belongings. By August 6, 1910, salvors under Capt. E.C. Generoux had reached Albion and expected to raise the vessel that day, with the plan being to move it to East Waterway at Seattle for repair. Albions cargo, approximately 45 tons worth, was still on board, but mostly irreparably damaged as a result of the vessel's submersion. There was $3,500 worth of damage to Albion. Later it turned out that Albion was carrying passengers (of which there were 7 or 8 on board), without the legally required passenger certificate. This caused some controversy, particularly in light of the fact that Albions cargo included ‚Äúmuch‚Äùgasoline and dynamite. In subsequent legal action, the owners of Albion were able to prevail against the Chippewa as to which vessel was at fault.Angeles Brewing and Malting v. Carter, 154 Pacific Reporter 601 (Wash. Sup.Ct. 1916)  Later history Prohibition caused Albion to be laid up for several years. Eventually Albion was bought by W.A. Lowman, who replaced the original (and unusual) compound steam engine with a more conventional design. The original compound engine was then installed in the steam tug Sound. In 1923, Albion went to Capt. Martin Heffner, doing business as the Bremerton Towboat Company. In 1924, Heffner converted Albion to a combination cannery tender and fuel tanker. The vessel was rebuilt to be able to hold 80 tons of fish and 17,000 gallons of fuel. A Atlas diesel was installed to replace the steam engine. Under Heffner and Capt. R. Andrus, Albion was used to serve the fishing fleet in the Cape Flattery area. However, Albion did not last long as a cannery tender. In September 1924, an overheated exhaust pipe started a fire. Capt. Edward Meagher and Walter G. McKay were the only two persons on board. They barely escaped with their lives, but the vessel was a total loss. Notes References  * Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W.

It was Anna Lee's second Hollywood film and her debut in a Hollywood star role. Plot Wealthy publisher Anthony Mason (Ronald Colman) weds ditsy socialite Caroline (Anna Lee) who sees nothing wrong with chasing men even after her marriage. Caroline flirts with Paco Del Valle (Gilbert Roland) while at a charity ball in Alpine Lodge, Idaho, and Paco then asks Mr. Bliss (Charles Winninger), her father, for permission to marry his daughter. Bliss tells them they need to ask her husband, and Caroline and Paco telegraph Anthony in New York. As the two reach the Idaho airport and are waiting for an eastbound plane, Mason has just himself arrived. Seeing the two together, he recalls in an involved flashback sequence a nearly identical and complicated situation from two years earlier when his wife was enamored of sculptor Paul Martindale (Reginald Gardiner) in Palm Beach, Florida. Returning to the present in Idaho, Caroline sees Mason's pilot carrying the bust of her that had been sculpted by Paul Martindale, and follows the pilot to where Mason was waiting. Martindale, having himself been at the charity ball, finds himself to be a chance spectator of the reunion. He proceeds to the airport terminal, where he joins Mason, Caroline, Bliss, and Del Valle. Caroline blithely tells Mason that she cannot decide now between Del Valle and Martindale, forcing Anthony into a new set of situations where he has to work overtime to win her back.

The company intended to make 10 films for RKO. My Life With Caroline was the first of five that were to star Colman. The film's screenplay was written by John Van Druten and Arnold Belgard, adapted from the 1938 Louis Verneuil French film The Train for Venice which was itself based upon the stage play LeTrain pour Venise written by Verneuil and Georges Berr. Director Milestone has tested actresses Miriam Hopkins, Paulette Goddard, and Jean Arthur for the role of Caroline but decided on Anna Lee after seeing her in footage from Robert Stevenson's Young Man's Fancy. While Anna Lee's first Hollywood film was Seven Sinners (1940), in it she was cast in a supporting role. My Life With Caroline represents her debut in a starring role. The film's sets were designed by the art director Nicolai Remisoff. Reception The New York Times panned the film, offering that Ronald Colman was ill-used in the film and writing that \\"either Mr. Colman is slipping or his writers are,\\" and expanded that John Van Druten and Arnold Belgard did not do a proper adaption of \\"a frivolous French play\\". They noted that what at one point in the film is meant to begin an ongoing \\"battle of wits\\" between the characters of Colman and Reginald Gardiner, devolved into a repetition of \\" gags,\\" and further questioned why Milestone \\"should put his usually fine directorial hand to a story as vapid as this,\\" and why otherwise competent performers \\"should be wasted on such obvious frippery.\\" The film recorded a loss of $32,000.

Early life and education Born in New York City, Grossman was the son of a businessman. He studied piano and trombone in his youth before entering Queens College, City University of New York in 1942. There he continued to pursue studies in both instruments and was a student of Karol Rathaus and Curt Sachs. His studies were interrupted by World War II, and he served in the United States Navy in the South Pacific from 1944-1946. After returning home in 1946, he returned to Queens College to finish his degree; reorienting his studies at that time towards a concentration in conducting. In the summers of 1947 and 1948 he was a student of conducting at the Tanglewood Music Center, studying under such greats as Leonard Bernstein, Boris Goldovsky, and Serge Koussevitzky. Career Herbert Grossman, 2008 In 1949 Grossman joined the conducting staff of the newly formed NBC Opera Theatre (NBCOT). In 1952 he took a leave of absence from that organization to further hone his conducting skills in Europe. He spent the next two years conducting operas at the Bavarian State Opera and working as an associate conductor of the Munich Philharmonic. He returned to the NBCOT in 1954 when he was appointed the company's new associate conductor, and in 1956 he was promoted to conductor at the NBCOT. He conducted several operas for television for NBC up until the company disbanded in 1964, including the world premieres of Philip Bezanson's Golden Child (1960) and Gian Carlo Menotti's Labyrinth (1962) and the 1963 film of Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors.Larry Wolters (October 18, 1964). \\"Less Tuneful Season in the Offing for TV\\". The Chicago Tribune While working for the NBCOT, Grossman joined the conducting staff of the New York City Opera (NYCO) in 1955. His first opera with the company was a production of Georges Bizet's Carmen with Gloria Lane as the title heroine. He conducted only periodically at the NYCO over the next several years, leading performances of mainly contemporary works like The Medium and The Triumph of St. Joan. In 1956 a successful guest conducting job with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra led to further contracts with that orchestra, and ultimately the appointment of the post of associate conductor of that orchestra in 1959. He remained in that post until his resignation in April 1962, after which he served as associate conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under conductor William Steinberg in 1962-1963. From 1972-1985 he was conductor of the Great Neck Symphony. In 1958 Grossman conducted a production of Menotti's The Consul at the New Orleans Opera. That same year he worked for the first time on Broadway as the music director of Menotti's Maria Golovin; a work which he later conducted at the NYCO in 1959. He went on to conduct for several more original Broadway productions, including The Roar of the Greasepaint ‚Äì The Smell of the Crowd (1965), Drat! The Cat! (1965), Walking Happy (1966‚Äì1967), and Cry for Us All (1970). His last conducting job on Broadway was for the 1972 musical Ambassador. Grossman was also a frequent conductor at the San Francisco Opera (SFO) during the 1960s. He first conducted for the SFO in 1964, leading a production of Carlisle Floyd's Susannah starring Lee Venora in the title role and Richard Cassilly as Sam. Other operas he conducted at the SFO were Madama Butterfly (1965), The Crucible (1965), Carry Nation (1966), The Turn of the Screw (1966), The Magic Flute (1967), Manon Lescaut (1967), Cavalleria Rusticana (1967), Pagliacci (1967), and The Tales of Hoffmann (1967). He also served as the Music Director of SFO's Western Opera Theater from 1966‚Äì1968. Grossman was married to writer and opera translator Anne Chotzinoff Grossman, who was the daughter of pianist, critic, and NBCOT founder Samuel Chotzinoff and the niece of violinist Jascha Heifetz. Anne worked as an associate producer at the NBCOT and it was there that the couple met. They married in 1951, and their marriage of 51 years came to an end upon Anne's death of lung cancer in 2002. The couple notably collaborated on translating Puccini's Gianni Schicchi into the English language; a translation which has been widely used (including by the Metropolitan Opera) and is included in the published score by Ricordi. In 2009, Grossman married former friend and opera singer Sylvia B. Davis (b. 1935) in a ceremony at West Gilgo Beach, New York. Grossman died in 2010 at the age of 83 in West Gilgo Beach, New York. The cause was kidney failure.

He was the author of the book Sri Ramkrishna Punthi, a long narrative poem on the life and teachings of one of the most illustrious figures of 19th-century India. After reading the work, Swami Vivekananda wrote from the United States to a brother monk in India, \\"Give Akshaya a hundred thousand hearty embraces from me. Through his pen Sri Ramakrishna is manifesting himself. Blessed is Akshaya.\\"They Lived with God Biography=Early Days Akshay Kumar Sen was born in 1854 in a village called Maynapur in the Bankura district of Bengal to Haladhar Sen and Bidhumukhi Devi. He belonged to a very poor family and did not have means to get a good education. He was married and had two sons and a daughter. Sen moved to Calcutta where he was employed as a private tutor of the children of the Tagore family. In 1885 he had a chance encounter of Sri Ramakrishna when the later came down to visit one of his devotees, Mahimacharan in Calcutta. Akshaya accompanied another devotee, Devendranath Majumdar, to Mahimacharan's house. Subsequent meetings with Sri Ramakrishna After the first meeting, Akshay had several other meetings with Sri Ramakrishna. He went to Dakshineswar temple with one of his friends. Although he himself did not have much interaction with Ramakrishna, he listened to his discourses keenly which subsequently formed the subject of his writings on Sri Ramakrishna. In April 1885 Devendra arranged a festival at his house in Sri Ramakrishna's honour and Akshay was invited. He often had experiences by which he felt that the master was deliberately ignoring him. But he kept coming back to Sri Ramakrishna with patience and devotion. =Kalpataru (the wish fulfilling tree) day= In December 1885, the condition of Sri Ramakrishna, who was suffering from throat cancer, worsened, and he had to be transferred to a spacious rented garden house in Cossipore, near Calcutta. On 1 January 1886, Sri Ramakrishna came out for a walk and showered blessings on all his disciples. The day is known as Kalpataru Day in the circle of Sri Ramakrishna devotees. Kalpataru is a mythical wish fulfilling tree. Akshay recalls what happened to him in his own narrative: \\"When it was about 3 o'clock the Master came downstairs and walked towards the garden path. The devotees followed him. All others, who were elsewhere, hearing that the Master was walking in the garden, rushed there. We came down at once and quickly went to the place where the Master was walking with the other devotees. I stood on one side behind the Master. Two beautiful champa flowers were in my hands. The great devotee Girish (Chandra Ghosh) was near the Master and talking with him. The Master was charmingly dressed that day. Looking at him once the form cannot be forgotten. He wore a red bordered cotton cloth. A green coloured coat was on his body. He had a cotton cap which covered his head and also his ears. On his feet there were socks and slippers which had decorations of creepers and leaves on them. His face was shining and luminous. Though the body was emaciated by his terrible illness, his face was charming and rays of light were always playing on it...... A little afterwards, the Master blessed the devotees and raising his right hand said, 'May you have (God)consciousness. What else can I say?' Then the Master returned to the path leading towards the house. I was standing some distance away. From there he addressed me, 'Hello, my boy, what are you doing?' He then came near, touched my chest with his hand and recited something in my ear which, being a Maha-mantra, I shall keep secret. What did I see and what did I hear? I shall only say that my heart's desire was fulfilled that day and I only wish to pass the rest of my days in singing the glory of Sri Ramakrishna.\\"They lived with God Literary Pursuits After Sri Ramakrishna's death in August 1886, Akshay decided to pen down some of his teachings in the form of a long narrative poem. He was encouraged in this effort by Swami Vivekananda. In 1887 he started writing the verses and after finishing a part of it he got it reviewed by Swami Vivekananda who was impressed by his writings and took him to holy mother Sri Sarada Devi. He wrote the work in the form of a panchali or long narrative poem in a local style prevalent in Bengal between 1884 and 1901. He sent a copy of his work to Swami Vivekananda who was ecstatic by the depiction. The book was initially named as Charitamrita and then later came to be known as Sri Sri Ramakrishna Punthi. The book has been translated into English prose under the title A Portrait of Sri Ramakrishna. Apart from the Punthi, Akshay also wrote The Teachings of Sri Ramakrishna in 1896 and The Glory of Sri Ramakrishna (Sr√Æ Sr√Æ R√¢makrishna \\\\- Mahim√¢) in 1910, both in Bengali. Critics say the Punthi is a complementary work to two other authoritative volumes on Sri Ramakrishna, the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna by 'M' and Sri Ramakrishna the Great Master by Swami Saradananda. Later life Afterwards Akshaya returned to his native village and despite moderate success of his books he remained poor. He travelled to the birthplace of Sri Ramakrishna, Kamarpukur and met the holy mother Sarada Devi. He died of bloody dysentery on 7 December 1923.

Its coastline falls entirely within the modern administrative area of Dumfries and Galloway and shared between the historical counties of Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbrightshire. The bay is broadly triangular in form, widening to the southeast and with the estuary of the River Cree entering from the northwest at its head. The inner parts of the bay are characterized by large expanses of salt marsh and mudflats. The River Bladnoch flows into the estuarial section of the Cree near Wigtown. The Water of Fleet is a third significant river which enters Wigtown Bay via Fleet Bay on its eastern shore. At the mouth of Fleet Bay are the Islands of Fleet include Ardwall Island, Barlocco Isle and Murray‚Äôs Isles.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map sheets 311 and 312 The western shore of the bay is formed by The Machars peninsula. This coast is itself indented by Rigg (or Cruggleton) Bay and by Garlieston Bay on which the village of Garlieston sits. The small town of Wigtown also stands on the western shore of the bay whilst the village of Creetown lies at the head of the bay. Wigtown Bay forms the largest local nature reserve in Britain. It has also been designated as a site of special scientific interest. A proposal to construct an offshore windfarm in Wigtown Bay was turned down by the Scottish government in early 2011. The potential effect on tourism was cited as a major reason in the decision. As of 2014, Wigtown Bay is currently under threat from another industrial turbine project, this time by Ecotricity. An application for a met mast was overturned by Dumfries and Galloway Council in August (At the Planning Applications Committee meeting on 27 August 2014 a petition with over 250 signatures of people from The Machars objecting to the met mast was also tabled), but the renewable energy company have appealed directly to the Scottish Government. Should the met mast be erected, it will be a precursor to a 7 x 110m tip height wind turbine site overlooking the bay. This development is called California. Almost 180 submissions from members of the public were made to the Scottish Government (DPEA) about the proposed met mast. Not one, was in favour. On 4 November 2014, Ecotricity, submitted a Proposal of Application Notice for 7 x 110m turbines (California) to Dumfries and Galloway Council. A public meeting was held at the Wigtown County Buildings on Tuesday 16 December 2014. Ecotricity declined to attend, although they decided to hold an invitee only 'Community Liaison Group' at the same venue on 18 December - a date which Save Wigtown Bay offered them as a choice of three dates to attend the public meeting initially. On 20 February 2015, Ecotricity submitted a full planning application to Dumfries and Galloway Council, this, despite not receiving a decision on its met mast appeal from the Scottish government. On 9 April 2015, Ecotricity's appeal was successful. On 10 April 2015, the deadline to object to California (15/P/2/0053) passed. Nearly 1300 individual objections were logged. 6 community councils have also opposed the plans. Historic Scotland officially object to California on 30 April 2015. A Dumfries and Galloway Council planning determination deadline for 'California' has now been set at 31 October. As at 28 November 2015, a decision is yet to be made. On 29 January 2016 Ecotricity lodged a direct planning Appeal with the Scottish Government DPEA for 'California.' (PPA-170-2107). They have done this before the elected representatives on the Dumfries and Galloway Council Planning Applications Committee, have made its decision on the proposed turbine site.

The book was initially published on April 24, 2009 by Basic Books and reissued on February 23, 2010. Summary Sowell, a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, explores political and economic causes of the American housing crisis. For example, he links the Community Reinvestment Act to decreased lending standards that resulted in an increase of subprime mortgages, as the law forced banks to set up quotas of lending to minorities.The Housing Boom and Bust, pp. 37-41. As a result, \\"lenders had to resort to 'innovative or flexible' standards.\\"The Housing Boom and Bust, p. 39. He also contrasts housing prices for modest middle-class homes in California and Texas and theorizes that California, with open space and various other zoning laws, had homes that were more expensive than those of similar size in Texas, which lacks such laws. Politically, Sowell targets the George W. Bush administration and Congress members of both major political parties for obstructing audits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and enabling banks to make highly risky housing loans. Regarding housing prices, Reason magazine summarized his stance: \\"the immense local variability in housing prices and failed loans reveals that the government mistook a set of local problems for a national one.\\" Critical reception Walter E. Williams, a colleague of Sowell and economics professor at George Mason University, called the book \\"an eye-opener for anyone interested in the truth about the collapse of the housing market that played a major role in our financial market crisis.\\" For The American Spectator magazine, Joseph Lawler considered The Housing Boom and Bust \\"an examination of the ruling class's inability to leave well enough alone.\\" Art Carden wrote in a positive review that the book would appeal to both specialists and non- specialists, and argued, \\"Morality tales featuring clear villains, easy-to- identify victims and valiant saviors riding to the rescue might be appealing, but they obscure the systemic problems that produced the crisis. [...] Sowell, by contrast, offers a more complete explanation in which he identifies the relevant actors, the incentives they faced, and the historical conditions they faced.\\" Robert J.

He was originally a member of the Dominican Order, wherefore he had access to read Papally-censored works of John Calvin and was converted to Protestant doctrine. He later joined forces with John Knox and had a significant part in the Scottish Reformation. Life John Craig was born about 1512. His father died at the Battle of Flodden (1513). Craig attended the University of St. AndrewsJulian, John.

Cleared of a suspicion of heresy, he left, in 1537, for England, and then traveled to Rome. Through the influence of Cardinal Pole he obtained a position instructing novices at the Dominican house in Bologna, where he subsequently became rector or head official of perhaps the oldest university. Ironically, since Dominicans were charged with suppressing ideas judged to be heretical, Craig here had access to the library of the Inquisition holding forbidden books like John Calvin's Institutes and came through his analysis to adopt some of Calvin's views. Craig himself was thus sent to Rome charged as a heretic. Sentenced to be burned on 19 August 1559, Craig escaped the day before during civil unrest prompted by the death of the unpopular Pope Paul IV on 18 August, upon which crowds broke into the prisons to free his captives. One of Psalms translated by John Craig (\\"I.C.\\") ca. AD 1564, Scottish Psalter He made his way to Vienna, where as a Dominican, he preached before emperor Maximilian II, and soon became a favourite at court. The Emperor gave him letters of safe conduct to England and Craig returned to Scotland, where he preached at Magdalen's Chapel in Edinburgh. In 1561 was appointed Mary, Queen of Scots's royal chaplain of Holyrood House in Edinburgh. In 1563 he was joint minister with John Knox of St. Giles's. In 1571 he became minister of Montrose, and in 1573 moved to Aberdeen where he was named Superintendent of Mar and Buchan. In 1579 Craig was minister of Holyrood and domestic chaplain to James VI. He was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Craig played a vital role in writing the Second Book of Discipline for the Scottish Church. In January 1581 he critcised James Stewart, Earl of Arran by preaching on the subject of false accusations. Arran had accused Regent Morton of involvement in the murder of Lord Darnley, and he threatened Craig with a dagger.William Boyd, Calendar of State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 577. He drew up the National Covenant of 1581, and wrote a very popular catechism known as \\"Craig's Catechism\\". Craig was moreover a vigorous defender of the presbyterial form of church government in opposition to episcopacy, which brought him into conflict with King James. King James had personally appointed Craig, \\"one of the best-gifted in the kingdom\\" as his Royal Chaplain, so when Craig rebuked him during his captivity so sharply from the pulpit (19 September 1582) for having issued a proclamation offensive to the clergy, \\"the king wept\\". On 21 July 1588 Craig officiated at the wedding of Henrietta Stewart and the Earl of Huntly at Holyroodhouse.

Life He was born at Raskelf, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, in 1551, and is said to have been beneficed as a clergyman in Lancashire. Subsequently, he became a Roman Catholic, and was imprisoned at York, around 1573. In 1576 he went to Douay College, and in 1579, when twenty-eight, entered the English College, Rome as a student of philosophy. In 1581, by then a priest, he was in the English seminary at Rome, and in the following March (1582) was sent into England. In 1586 he appears as the associate of Thomas Worthington and other priests in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, and elsewhere. He was mentioned in 1592 as one ill-affected to the government, and he shared the fate of other seminary priests in being arrested. He was sent to London; but he recanted, and was sent back to Lancashire to help look for Jesuits. After this he went to Cambridge, where he began the publication of his controversial writings. After leaving Catholicism he participated in the persecution of Catholics, advocating the use of the rack, leading night time searches of Catholic homes and made a list of Catholics who had previously given him money as well as Lancastrian houses where Catholicism was still practiced. Works They include: * Thomas Bels Motives: concerning Romish Faith and Religion, Cambridge, 1593; 2nd ed. 1605. * A Treatise of Usurie, Cambridge, 1594. * The Survey of Popery, London, 1596. * Hunting of the Romish Fox, 1598.

Its main deposit lies in the west of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, where it runs up to the Bohemian border, ending south of Pirna. It is named after the village of Cotta in the borough of Dohma, an area where the stone is quarried.  Formation and properties  Cotta Sandstone was formed in the Cretaceous, in the Lower Turonian age. It is one of the Elbe sandstones and its colours range from whitish to grey and yellowish grey. In the south of the area Cotta Sandstone is medium-grained, whilst, in the north it is fine-grained. Around the village of Cotta itself the grain size is evenly sized at 0.1 to 0.22 millimetres and only very rarely as large as 0.3 millimetres. The rock contains the smallest elements of mica minerals (glauconite), decomposed feldspar and carbon elements. The carbon particles are arranged in clearly recognisable veins. They occasionally resemble marble textures. The technical value of this natural stone varies considerably, because the quartz grains of Cotta Sandstone are frequentlysiliceously bonded, but it has many unevenly divided deposits of the phyllosilicates, illite and kaolinite.Siegfried Grunert: Der Elbsandstein: Vorkommen, Verwendung, Eigenschaften. In: Geologica Saxonica Journal of Central European Geology 52/53 (2007)  Extraction  The stone is quarried in Dohma (Gro√ü-Cotta), Bad Gottleuba-Berggie√üh√ºbel (in the villages of Gottleuba and Berggie√üh√ºbel), Langhennersdorf, Rottwerndorf, at Neundorf and Lohmgrund south of Pirna, in Gersdorf and Bahretal (Ottendorf), and in the Krippenbach valley. The quarrying of Elbe sandstones is made technically easier because of the separation of the beds with alternating outcrops and fissures, because the fissures are vertical and the beds run roughly at right angles to them. As a result, it is possible to cut rectangular blocks of unfinished stone. The thickness of the quarry-able sandstone beds varies from a ¬Ω to 3 metres. The thickness of the deposits of Cotta Sandstone ranges between 50 and 80 metres.Dienemann/Burre: Die nutzbaren Gesteine Deutschlands, p. 303  Use = General use  Formerly the sandstone quarried near Langhennersdorf, Berggie√üh√ºbel and Gersdorf, which was larger-grained, was cut not only for use as building or sculpting stone, but also for millstones.Dienemann/Burre: Die nutzbaren Gesteine Deutschlands, p. 304 Today (2008) Cotta Sandstone is used for solid window and door frames, sculpture work and high-profile stonemasonry. It is especially used in restoration, but also in new structures. Its most important use is for sculptures.

He was a Parti Qu√©b√©cois member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1976 to 1985 and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Ren√© L√©vesque and Pierre-Marc Johnson. Clair later became an executive administrator with Hydro-Qu√©bec. Early life and career Clair was born in Saint-Germain-de-Grantham and received his early education in that community and in Montreal, Quebec. He later earned a law degree from the Universit√© de Sherbrooke and was called to the bar of Quebec in 1974. He worked as a legal aid lawyer in Drummondville from 1974 to 1976 and earned a master's degree in criminology from the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Clair also wrote for a local newspaper and appeared on the radio station CHRD-FM. Legislator Clair was elected to the Quebec legislature in the 1976 provincial election for the division of Drummond. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois won a majority government in this election, and Clair entered the legislature as a backbench supporter of Ren√© L√©vesque's government. On May 17, 1979, he was promoted to parliamentary assistant to the minister of consumer affairs, cooperatives and financial institutions. At the time, he was the youngest cabinet minister in Quebec history.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Young gun in Quebec City: Boisclair's role belies his background,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 June 1996, A1.

In late 1980, he announced that Quebec would stop charging the provincial sales tax on advertising flyers in newspapers. He explained that neighbouring provinces did not tax the flyers, and that Quebec's printing industry had accordingly been at a disadvantage.\\"Sales tax,\\" Globe and Mail, 17 December 1980, B6. ;Transport minister Clair was re-elected in the 1981 provincial election and was shifted to the position of transport minister on April 30, 1981.\\"Levesque ignores two anglophones in Cabinet shuffle,\\" Globe and Mail, 1 May 1981, p. 8. He completed an agreement with federal minister Jean-Luc Pepin the same June to modernize commuter transit in the Montreal area.\\"Quebec transit to be updated,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 June 1981, p. 11. The following month, however, he criticized the federal government for cancelling some regional train services and said that the closures would not have been necessary if proposed upgrades had been made five years earlier.\\"Lack of federal foresight ruining rail, minister says,\\" Globe and Mail, 30 July 1981, p. 8. In November 1981, Clair announced an appeal to the Federal Court of Canada to stop the federal government's planned cutbacks.\\"Stop Via Rail cutbacks, Quebec asks Federal Court,\\" Globe and Mail, 11 November 1981, p. 12. In February 1982, Clair introduced legislation stipulating that all persons in the front seat of a moving vehicle be required to wear a seatbelt; taxi drivers, police, and young children had previously been exempted.\\"Seatbelt law tightened up in Quebec,\\" Globe and Mail, 13 February 1982, p. 14.

Clair took part in negotiations in 1982‚Äì83 to save the financially troubled Quebecair, North America's only French-language airline. He reached an agreement in principle with Ontario transport minister James Snow in August 1982 that would have seen a merger of Nordair and Quebecair with involvement from Air Ontario.David Stewart-Patterson, \\"Quebec, Ontario airlines plan merger,\\" Globe and Mail, 10 August 1982, B1. The federal government rejected this plan and instead suggested replacing Quebecair with a new service co-owned by Air Canada and the Quebec government.David Stewart- Patterson, \\"Ottawa wants new airline to replace Quebecair,\\" Globe and Mail, 23 November 1982, B1; Wendie Kerr, \\"Rejection by Ottawa of merger of airlines puzzles SID president,\\" Globe and Mail, 24 November 1982, B5. Clair ultimately declined this proposal and announced in June 1983 that the Quebec government would take over and restructure the airline. This was not intended as a nationalization; Clair said that he hoped private investors would manage the company.Wendie Kerr and Margot Gibb-Clark, \\"Quebecair taken over by province,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 June 1983, B1; Margot Gibb-Clark, \\"Change of face for the summer,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 June 1983, p. 8. Clair strongly criticized the Canadian National Railway's decision in 1983 to shift its administrative offices for trucking and express services from Montreal to Toronto.\\"CN planning to merge 2 units' administration,\\" Globe and Mail, 17 June 1982, B12. ;Treasury Board President After a cabinet shuffle on March 5, 1984, Clair was named as president of the treasury board and minister responsible for administration. In early 1985, he introduced new labour legislation that cut the right of public-sector workers to strike over money issues, established a joint labour-management committee to study economic conditions and pay increases, and decentralized some aspects of bargaining to reflect local conditions.\\"Closure used to cut debate on service bill,\\" Globe and Mail, 15 June 1985, p. 12. Quebec Federation of Labour president Louis Laberge and other labour leaders opposed some aspects of the bill, particularly the restrictions on the right to strike.\\"Labor troubles loom: unions,\\" Globe and Mail, 31 January 1985, p. 8; \\"Quebec labor protests against anti-strike bill,\\" Globe and Mail, 4 February 1985, p. 5. The L√©vesque government passed the legislation after invoking closure on debate.\\"Closure used to cut debate on service bill,\\" Globe and Mail, 15 June 1985, p. 12. Clair announced in March 1985 that Quebec would spend $27.4 billion in the 1985‚Äì86 fiscal year, an increase of 5.7 per cent over the previous year.Graham Fraser, \\"Auto crash costs shifted to insurance fund Quebec spending set at $27.4 billion,\\" Globe and Mail, 20 March 1985, p. 4. ;Internal PQ crisis In 1984, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois went through an internal crisis over its support for Quebec sovereignty. Some leading party figures, including Ren√© L√©vesque, wanted to moderate the party's position, while others favoured a more hardline stance in support of Quebec independence Clair sided with the moderates. When delegates at a party conference voted to tie the PQ to a hardline ind√©pendantiste stand in the next provincial election, Clair quipped that he had \\"never seen turkeys so eager for Christmas.\\"Graham Fraser and Margot Gibb-Clark, \\"Levesque swallows reservations on sovereignty stand,\\" Globe and Mail, 11 June 1984, p. 1. The PQ's divisions continued until November 1984, when several ind√©pendantiste hardliners resigned from the government. Clair served as acting minister of social affairs from November 27 to November 29, replacing one of the departed ministers until a full-time replacement was found.Graham Fraser and Margot Gibb-Clark, \\"Levesque patches Cabinet holes as sixth minister quits,\\" Globe and Mail, 28 November 1984. ;Treasury Board/Energy and Resources Ren√© L√©vesque resigned as Parti Qu√©b√©cois leader and premier in June 1985, and Clair supported Pierre-Marc Johnson's successful bid to become the party's new leader.Daniel Drolet, \\"Caucus support is leaning heavily towards Johnson,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 July 1985, A4. Johnson became premier in October 1985 and announced a cabinet shuffle on October 17, keeping Clair in the treasury board portfolio and giving him extra responsibilities as minister of energy and resources.\\"Premier responsible for second portfolio,\\" Globe and Mail, 17 October 1985, A5. On November 11, Clair approved almost two million dollars in mining exploration grants for seven companies.Andrew McIntosh, \\"Quebec ridings given $140 million by PQ gravy train,\\" Globe and Mail, 2 December 1985, A4. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois lost the 1985 provincial election to the Quebec Liberal Party, and Clair was defeated in Drummond by the narrow margin of 102 votes. He formally resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Johnson ministry on December 12, 1985. Out of government After the 1985 election, Clair worked as chief of staff to Pierre-Marc Johnson in the latter's role as leader of the official opposition. He resigned in December 1986 for what he described as \\"purely personal reasons.\\"\\"PQ chief of staff leaving his post,\\" Globe and Mail, 10 December 1986, A4. Clair later served as leader of the Quebec Association of Nursing Homes from 1987 to 1994; in September 1989, he described as strike by hospital and health-care workers as \\"unthinkable\\" in terms of its effects on elderly residents.Robert McKenzie and Nancy Wood, \\"Cabinet recalled as Quebec braces for massive strike by civil servants,\\" Toronto Star, 6 September 1989, A3; Andre Picard, \\"Bourassa asks public to help in Quebec strike,\\" Globe and Mail, 16 September 1989, A1. Clair traveled to Romania with a Montreal television crew in late 1989 to record a series of reports on the status of the country's minority Hungarian community. One of these reports included a clandestine interview with L√°szl√≥ T≈ëk√©s, who was arrested shortly after the broadcast took place. T≈ëk√©s's arrest helped trigger the 1989 Romanian revolution, and some have suggested that Clair's interview played a significant role in provoking the latter event.Therese Boyle, \\"Video made by Canadians may have influenced events,\\" Toronto Star, 26 December 1989, A11; \\"LIBERAL LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE HEADS RALLY FOR PERSECUTED MINISTER IN ROMANIA,\\" Canada NewsWire, 15 November 1989, 10:17. The leadership candidate was Tom Wappel, a Canadian of Hungarian background. Wappel and Clair appeared together at a benefit for T≈ëk√©s in Toronto, Ontario. Clair became president of the venture capital firm Fondel Drummond in 1990. Deputy minister and Hydro-Quebec administrator The Parti Qu√©b√©cois were returned to office with a majority government under Jacques Parizeau's leadership in the 1994 provincial election. Clair was not a candidate in the election but was appointed as deputy minister of energy and resources on November 28, 1994. By virtue of this position, he also served on the board of Hydro-Quebec.\\"Hydro- Quebec. Re Directorate,\\" Regulatory News Service, 21 February 1995.

Health services Clair was appointed by the government of Quebec to chair a commission on health and social services in 2000. While the commission held its hearings, some critics charged that Clair was biased in favour of privatization; he rejected this charge.Jane Davenport, \\"MDs' coalition shuns hearing: Consultations called sham,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 September 2000, A5. Clair's report was submitted in January 2001, and its recommendations included an increased role for the private sector in health delivery, user fees on items such as meals and laundry for hospital patients, the guaranteed access of all Quebeckers to a family doctor, and the creation of a new publicly funded insurance plan to support treatment for disabled elderly persons. The report also suggested that some aspects of the Canada Health Act were outdated and led to unequal services; one example provided was that all doctor's visits were covered, while home care was not.Rheal Seguin, \\"A panel of experts argues for a useful private-sector role as part of an urgent effort to update medical care,\\" Globe and Mail, 18 January 2001, A4; Robert McKenzie, \\"Quebec takes on \`old' Health Act --- Report calls for new look at legislation deemed \`antiquated',\\" Toronto Star, 18 January 2001, p. 1.

The term is generally used in referring to large-scale evacuations where the necessity thereof is foreseen. Events that can require pre-movement time include hurricanes, wars, nuclear accidents, and major conflagrations. Pre-movement time is divided into four distinct events: detection, the recognition of the emergency; decision, to commence evacuation or not, and of how many people and how great a territory; alarm, the announcement of the decision and conveyance to the populace, often by emergency broadcasts or over police loudspeakers, or by actual alarms, such as sirens; and reaction, the events and actions of the people affected, both emergency personnel and the citizenry, immediately after the declaration. Panic is rarely observed during this time, despite media depictions to the contrary. At first, lack of response arising from ignorance of the situation to outright disbelief or denial, is often noted. Different, confusing stimuli (e.g., smells of burning or smoldering, smoke, power outages, or tremors )may be detected and not put together to form a plan to evacuate, thus increasing pre-movement time. If occupants are performing some task or engaging in an activity, they may complete their business before tending to the crisis, even if they had some prior knowledge of it.\\"http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Human+behavior+and+evacuation+movement+in+smoke-a0201378197\\" Human Behavior and Pre-Movement Time. Retrieved 1 May 2010. As stimuli increase, those affected likely will attempt to ascertain the cause(s); some may walk around their immediate area, look in rooms or offices, and open doors. They may call the custodian or building superintendent to find out the problem. If no response is forthcoming, those affected likely will begin to talk among themselves and figure out the best plan of action. Depending on the information and cues available, this pre-movement time can last from a few seconds to several minutes. Part of pre-movement time also involves actions related to saving a structure (especially one's own home or domicile) or personal valuables. Some people will warn others of a danger, especially those close to them like family or dear friends. Evacuees will often contact family members by phone or e-mail to let them know that they are safe and are starting their evacuation. These types of actions are all part of pre-movement time. Reaction time to an evacuation can vary widely, depending on the type of emergency, its perceived danger, and any false alarms of such an emergency beforehand. It can even be affected by the means of communication. In one study, mock alarms were broadcast to subway riders in London, England using different forms of address: a simple bell, a bell followed by instructions from subway staff, a public address announcement lasting 30 seconds and broadcast twice, a combination of staff instructions and public address, and finally by instructions, public address, informing people of the emergency, and announcing the type of emergency.\\"http://hpac.com/fire- smoke/smoke_control_fire/\\" Pre-Movement Time- Chart. Retrieved 1 May 2010. In most cases, but not always, the more forceful the call to evacuate and the more staff were involved, the quicker riders got on escalators to evacuate.

Life The son of Edward Walsingham of Exhall, near Alcester, Warwickshire, he was born in Hawick. Borders His father died before his birth, and his mother, who was a Roman Catholic, brought him to London. His uncle, Humphrey Walsingham, who was a relation of Sir Francis Walsingham, placed him at St Paul's School, London. As the part of his instruction there he read the Protestant divines John Foxe, John Jewell, John Calvin, and Theodore Beza, and in 1603 he was ordained deacon by Martin Heton, bishop of Ely. Doubts were raised in Walsingham's mind as to the validity of his orders and of his belief, by reading the Manual of Robert Parsons, and in October 1606 he entered the English College, Rome. He was ordained priest on 12 April 1608, and early next year, having entered the Society of Jesus, he visited England. In 1616 he was formally attached to the English mission, and served in Leicestershire. In 1633 he moved to the college of the Immaculate Conception, Derbyshire, and there he died on 1 July 1647. Works He published Search made into Matters of Religion, by F. W., before his change to the Catholike (s. l. 1609; 2nd edit. St. Omer, 1615). The work was dedicated to James I, to whom the author states he had formerly submitted his religious difficulties. Down to the time of Alban Butler it was frequently commended to those showing an inclination to Roman Catholicism, and was often reprinted and abridged. In the controversial parts, and especially in the attack on the \\"falsities\\" of Matthew Sutcliffe, Walsingham perhaps worked with Parsons. In 1618 he published his Reasons for embracing the Catholic Faith (London).

The park was established in 1931. Over 1100 varieties of roses are grown there, many of them gifts from countries around the world. The Rome Rose Garden covers 10,000 m square and each section has rose varieties characteristic of, or grown in, the respective variety. The park also has an experimental section where new varieties of roses are tested for their suitability for public and private gardens in Italy. History In this site, near the Roman Ghetto, since 1645 until 1934 was in place the Jewish cemetery in Rome. Because of that, the site was named by the Roman people \\"Ortaccio degli ebrei\\" (). In 1934 the Jewish community of Rome obtained as cemetery a section of the monumental cemetery of Campo Verano. To remember the past of the garden, the ensemble of its footpaths was designed as a reproduction of the Menorah. The original design for the park was drawn up in 1931 by countess Mary Gayley Senni, with 300 roses. Planting goals When selecting the rose varieties, one of the goals was to show different groups of roses, the products of early breeding of roses and modern roses such as Hybrid roses, miniature roses, rose shrubs, and modern climbers. Another goal was to demonstrate various garden possibilities: Blossoming swathes of colour, roses climbing up pergolas and pillars, \\"sculpted\\" rose shrubs, rambling roses, standards roses, roses with decorative fruit, hedges made up of rose bushes, and more.

It was discovered in 2001, by George Caton who was operating a mechanical digger and noticed small cubes of coloured stone, which turned out to be part of the floor of an eight-roomed Roman Villa and is the largest Roman Mosaic so far discovered in Britain. Photogrammetry by English Heritage was followed by excavation led by the Somerset County Council archaeologist. They exposed and documented the mosaic in three weeks. It was then covered with sand and soil to preserve it. The work was recognised with the award of the Tarmac Finders Award (for non professionals) at the British Archaeological Awards in 2002. The stones used for the mosaic are Blue Lias from the surrounding hills. The fragments which were discovered in the surrounding soil were used to create a new mosaic, including a picture of a dolphin, using methods which would have been available in Roman times. It is now displayed in All Saints Church. A further mosaic was found in an adjoining room, which probably extended beyond the area excavated, which was about 4.5 metres square. The main mosaic is almost 7 metres square and has a complicated geometrical design, including some stylized figurative elements such as leaves, cups and dolphins. It was probably laid by a putative specialist workshop based at Cirencester, known as the \\"Saltire school\\" for their fondness for saltires in designs, which is seen here. The walls of these rooms were probably also painted on plaster, but no traces survive here.

It eliminates unimportant and deleterious mutations while maintaining and combining beneficial mutations that would enhance protein function. Procedures For the relevant gene, a library of single stranded oligonucleotides is acquired and then mutated using random mutagenesis. The newly mutated library is then subjected to exonuclease activity, creating both sense and anti-sense fragments. The areas of partially overlapping fragments are then combined and extended using a PCR-like method. These double stranded mutants are then screened for the desired optimized function using a relevant assay. The best mutants are chosen for further exonuclease activity. The process (exonuclease, PCR-like recombination, and mutant screening) is repeated, usually about 10-12 times, in order to achieve the best possible mutants with only beneficial mutations.

Controversial speeches In August 2007, along with other elected and serving members of his party, Owaisi made death threats against Tasleema Nasreen, pledging that the fatwa against her and Salman Rushdie were to be abided by. Owaisi said, \\"we in Hyderabad want to behead this woman according to the fatwa.\\" While speaking at a rally in Kurnool in 2011, Owaisi used the derogatory terms Kafirs and Kufrastan to refer to MLAs in Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Assembly. In the same rally he used the Urdu words katil (murderer), darinda (monster), beimaan (dishonest), dhokebaaz (cheat), and chor (thief) for the former Prime Minister of India P V Narasimha Rao. Owaisi said that if Rao had not died, he (Owaisi) would have killed Rao with his own hands. In April 2012, Owaisi made derogatory and demeaning comments against Hindu god Rama and his mother Kaushalya. Owaisi asked \\"Where all did Ram's mother go wandering and where did she give birth to him\\". In August 2012, Owaisi claimed while speaking in Karimnagar that there have been \\"50,000\\" riots in India over 65 years since the country became independent.

In his two-hour-long speech, Owaisi made multiple comments against Hindus, Hindu deities, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Vishva Hindu Parishad, Bharatiya Janata Party Punjab Kesari reported that Owaisi referred to the Hindus as \\"impotent\\" and the Indian police as the \\"impotent army\\". He said that not even one crore impotent men can together father one child. He said that these people (Hindus) cannot face the Muslims, and whenever the Muslims start dominating the Hindus, the impotent army (police) intervenes. and added that the Muslims could \\"teach the rest of the world a lesson\\". Akbaruddin said that 25 crore Muslims would need just 15 minutes without the police to show 100 crore Hindus who is more powerful. Owaisi referred to Ajmal Amir Kasab, one of the Pakistani terrorists of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as a \\"child\\", and compared him with Narendra Modi. He said that if the Muslims of India united like the Muslims of Andhra Pradesh, Narendra Modi would soon be hanged. Owaisi threatened that if his words were not heard, \\"O India, destruction and ruin will be your fate\\". He threatened that India will witness a bloodshed which has not been seen in the last 1000 years. He also dared Narendra Modi to come to Hyderabad, threatening by saying \\"we will show him then\\". Owaisi justified the Mumbai bombings of 1993 by saying they were a reaction to the demolition of Babri Masjid and atrocities on Muslims in India. He also questioned the punishment handed out to the accused of the bombings, naming Tiger Memon as one of those punished even though Tiger Memon is still at large. Owaisi denigrated Hindu gods in his speech. Owaisi mocked Hindu cremation by saying \\"when you (Hindus) die, you become air after burning and go astray.\\" Owaisi talked in derogatory terms about heritage places of India including Ayodhya, Ajanta Caves and Ellora Caves. He said that if Muslims go away from India, they will take the Taj Mahal, Red Fort and Qutb Minar with them, adding \\"What will then remain here? Just a razed Ram temple in Ayodhya and naked statues of Ajanta.\\" Owaisi compared the state of Muslims of India to the state of Muslims of the world. Owaisi said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Vishva Hindu Parishad, and the Bharatiya Janata Party were poisonous snakes, and to \\"crush their heads\\" a stick is enough. After the speech, Owaisi left for London citing \\"medical treatment\\" as the reason. NDTV reported on 3 January that Owaisi was getting treated for intestinal injuries he sustained when he was attacked over a land dispute in 2011. Owaisi returned to Hyderabad on 7 January. Legal proceedings On 28 December 2012, a petition was filed in a local court in Nampally of Hyderabad against Akbaruddin Owaisi for hurting the sentiments of Hindus, and for making inflammatory, derogatory and offensive remarks. The Andhra Pradesh Human Rights Commission directed the Hyderabad Police Commissioner to submit an inquiry report on the alleged hate speech by 17 January 2013. On 3 January 2013, Abid Rasool Khan, General Secretary of Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee, told news channel CNN IBN that the state government had \\"taken cognizance of speech\\" and they were \\"collecting evidence to build a strong FIR and a water-tight case where we can book the person causing hatred.\\" On 5 January 2013, a case was filed against Owaisi in Mumbai while a court in Vadodara served a notice on him for his alleged hate speech. In May 2014, Andhra Pradesh government gave nod to prosecute Akbaruddin Owaisi in a 2004 case for an alleged hate speech.  Arrest and Bail  Owaisi returned to Hyderabad on 7 January 2013 and was welcomed by his 7 MLA's and MIM leaders at the Hyderabad airport. He later drove to his house in the Banjara Hills area of the city. Owaisi failed to answer police summons at Nirmal town on 8 January, citing ill-health, and asked for four days' time to appear for investigation. A team of doctors examined Owaisi at his home twice on 7 January and the police declared that he was fit for investigation, even though he complained of bad health. Owaisi also petitioned the High Court of Andhra Pradesh to quash the cases filed against him in lower courts. On 8 January, doctors examined him at the Gandhi Hospital and confirmed that their tests showed no medical grounds to prevent his arrest, following which he was arrested by Hyderabad police. At the Gandhi Hospital, Owaisi alleged that the doctors were trying to murder him by giving lethal injections. After spending 40 days in prison, Akbaruddin Owaisi was granted bail on 15 February 2013. Criticism and comments Several notable people and organisations criticised Owaisi for the speeches. The Andhra Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party president, G. Kishan Reddy called for booking Owaisi, annulment of his assembly membership and de-recognition of All India Majlis-e Ittihad al-Muslimin. Reddy said that \\"...religious bigotry, unabashed incitement of religious sentiments and contemptuous insinuation against Hindu gods and goddesses formed the crux of the speeches of a person who was sworn in as an MLA\\". In a statement issued by the Confederation of Voluntary Associations (COVA) on 30 December, several social activists criticised the speech saying that such \\"obnoxious\\" speeches will lead to division of society, violation of peace and conflicts. The social activists demanded exemplary action to prevent such \\"intolerable\\" acts in future. The signatories to the statement included Asghar Ali Engineer, Swami Agnivesh, Mahesh Bhatt, Hamid Mohammed Khan, Sandeep Pandey and Ram Puniyani. Journalist and BJP leader Balbir Punj said that Owaisi's speech was tantamount to inciting Muslims to revolt against the police and army and start a civil war, and he added that the silence of the media was surprising. Senior Congress Leader and National Spokesperson Raashid Alvi said, \\"I don't know what Akbar said in his speech and i don't think he said what you just mentioned, but i am sure that Andhra Pradesh Government will do the needful\\". Asaduddin Owaisi, elder brother of Akbaruddin, refused to comment on the speech saying the matter is sub judice. Congress politician Digvijay Singh said that everybody should think before speaking and demanded action against people making such speeches. TV news channel Times Now reported that the speech was so inflammatory and so provocative that they had decided not to broadcast it. Najeeb Jung, vice-Chancellor of the Jamia Millia Islamia university, told CNN-IBN that the police was giving excuses of backroom investigation, while it was only a matter of two-minutes to investigate since the \\"TV cutout\\" was available for everybody to see and contents of speech were available on Wikipedia for everybody to read. Jung said that the speech incited incendiary feelings between two communities of an extremely serious nature, and refused to believe Owaisi was ill. BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said referring to Owaisi and his party that the spirit of Osama bin Laden had entered into such people and they were trying to behave like the Taliban. The speech sparked anger and outrage on Twitter. On 28 December, journalists Karan Thapar and Swapan Dasgupta tweeted \\"Inflammatory speech by MLA Akbaruddin ‚Äì Remove police for 15 mins, We will finish off 1 billion Hindus.\\" Writer Taslima Nasreen tweeted that Owaisi is trying to indoctrinate the Muslims of India and such speeches will \\"produce thousands of Kasabs\\". Farhan Akhtar tweeted on 2 January 2013: \\"How can two girls be arrested in less than 24 hours for a harmless FB post, but Owaisi roams free after his blatantly communal rant. He said Owaisi is doing a disservice to the people he pretends to serve and represent. Fact is he represents only himself and serves only himself\\". Meanwhile, Salman Khan‚Äôs father, Salim Khan, when asked about Owaisi in an interview, stated that Akbaruddin Owaisi is not a Muslim leader. Shazia Ilmi said \\"Communalists like Owaisi should be arrested and not be glorified! They spew hatred, divide Indians and insult our nation\\".

It is a four- track through station, which does not have a ‚Äúhome‚Äù platform attached to the station building. Instead, it has two through and overtaking tracks on two island platforms, with one platform numbered 1 and 4 and the other 2 and 3, which is unusual in Germany, but occurs several times on the Left Rhine line. History  The station was inaugurated on 15 October 1855 as part of the extension of the Left Rhine line from Bonn to Rolandseck station. The need for Godesberg station, which was then in open fields, was said to stem from the fact that Godesberg was the location of the summer homes of many shareholders of the Bonn‚ÄìCologne Railway Company and the president of the Rhenish Railway Company. For years the shareholders had a table in the station buffet and insisted on almost all trains stopping in Godesberg. From the turn of the century Godesberg grew rapidly and established itself as a resort and retirement home for retired Prussians, increasing the importance of the station. The old neoclassical entrance hall was too small and in 1908 it was replaced by the Art Nouveau building that still exists, with even its interior largely preserved; this is located just south of the old station. At the same time, the route of the railway line was raised by about a metre and subways were built under the line for the streets of Friedrichallee, Rheinallee and B√ºrgerstra√üe. As Godesberg's name was changed to Bad Godesberg in 1925, the name of the station was also similarly changed. After the city was incorporated was to Bonn in 1969, the station was again renamed in the summer 1971 timetable and received its present name of Bonn-Bad Godesberg. Since the mid-1980s express trains have not served Bonn-Bad Godesberg, except for a period in the early 1990s, when at first InterCity Night services stopped at Bad Godesberg and later Intercity-Express trains on the Bonn‚ÄìBerlin route started and ended in Bad Godesberg. Operations  Platform track 1 is served by regular regional trains to the south (Koblenz and on to Mainz). Track 2 is used by regional trains to the north (Bonn and on to Cologne). Tracks 3 and 4 are only used as sidings and as passing tracks. Train services Today the station is served by Regional-Express and Regionalbahn services and is served by four routes each hour, so that to and from Bonn Hauptbahnhof there are services at approximately 15-minute intervals. The station is above a Deutsche Bahn ticket office and some small shops. The main station building is now occupied by the Klangstation, a concert, theatre and lecture hall. The station is served by the following services:Timetables for Bonn-Bad Godesberg station *Regional services Rhein-Express Emmerich - Oberhausen - Duisburg - D√ºsseldorf - Cologne - Bonn - Andernach - Koblenz *Local services MittelrheinBahn Cologne - Bonn - Remagen - Andernach - Koblenz - Bingen - Mainz *Local services Rhein- Ahr-Bahn Bonn - Remagen - Bad Neuenahr - Dernau - Ahrbr√ºck *Local services Rhein-Wupper-Bahn Wuppertal-Oberbarmen - Wuppertal - Solingen - Cologne - Bonn - Bonn-Mehlem Stadtbahn services Underground station Since 1994, a station of the Bonn Stadtbahn has been located under the Bad Godesberg railway station.  Plans  Between 2014 and 2016, an extensive modernisation and renovation of the station is to be carried out, including the complete renovation of the pedestrian underpass and the installation of lifts on the platforms.

His time in Chicago had brought him in close contact with a number of social reformers such as Jane Addams, Mary McDowell, Ellen Gates Starr, Edith Abbott, Sophonisba Breckinridge, Florence Kelley, Julia Lathrop, Alice Hamilton, Grace Abbott and later in England, Scottish labor leader and socialist Keir Hardie and Russian anarchist Peter Alekseevich Kropotkin.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ In 1905 Hunter joined the Socialist Party of America along with his wife, his brother-in-law, James Stokes, and his sister-in-law, Rose Pastor Stokes, On September 12 of that year he was named to the executive committee of the newly established Intercollegiate Socialist Society in New York.

Amina Mariam Bokhary, 32, received a sentence of probation (a non-custodial sentence) and a one-year driving ban following an incident in the aftermath of a road traffic accident when she struck several police officers. She had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008. The perceived leniency in her sentence provoked an uproar in Hong Kong for alleged preferential treatment. In particular, the presiding judge caused outrage when he said in his judgment that Bokhary had an \\"unblemished background and was born into a good family with caring parents [and] an outstanding academic record\\". The comment highlighted the public perception of widening inequality and increasing disparities in the balance of power between different social classes in Hong Kong. The judge came under pressure to reconsider his decision but he declined to vary his order upon review. Pundits also blamed the Department of Justice for charging her with an offence carrying a lesser maximum penalty; the Department of Justice appealed her sentence. Opinion polls carried out indicated that the public's confidence in the judiciary and the impartiality of the courts had been shaken in light of the incident. Ultimately, Bokhary breached her conditions of probation and was re-sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment. On appeal, her driving ban was extended by two years.  Background to the incident  Bokhary is a member of an influential Hong Kong family. Her father, Syed Bagh Ali Shah, was a council member of the former Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Her uncle, Kemal, was a judge sitting at the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, and Kemal's wife was a High Court judge, at the time of the trial; a maternal uncle, Ronald Arculli, had been the chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing and was a non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong. Her grandfather, Daoud Bokhary, served in the British Indian Army and founded Bokhary Securities. Bokhary attended university in the United Kingdom and graduated with a first-class honors degree in economics. She has had a string of jobs in the fashion industry, including Sotheby's, LVMH, and Harvey Nichols in Hong Kong.\\"Amina Bokhary\\", New Data Agency, 26 March 2011 According to her counsel, Bokhary failed to find peace or satisfaction in her personal and professional life after returning to Hong Kong from Britain, and in 2007 was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which she was being treated with strong psychotropic drugs and was reportedly undergoing intensive counselling. Her increasing alcohol consumption, combined with her medication, was said to have contributed to her violent outburst in 2008.  Prior incidents  Bokhary's first brush with the police was in the early hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central district of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence. Bokhary was involved in a second altercation at around 3 am on 13 July 2008, again in Central. Short of cash with which to pay the HK$17.80 taxi fare, she proffered her credit card. When the taxi driver refused, Bokhary angrily flung her credit card in the driver's face; she kicked him when he prevented her from leaving the scene. The police were called. As she was being questioned by the two officers, Bokhary struck one of them. She was arrested and charged with common assault and assaulting a police officer. She was on medication and had drunk wine prior to the incident. Pleading guilty to both charges in November 2008, she was sentenced to 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay the driver HK$1,000 in compensation.  Incident and trial  Eastern Magistrates' Court building, in which the controversial first trial took place Bokhary's vehicle was involved in a head-on collision with a bus on Stubbs Road shortly after midnight on 27 January 2010. She refused paramedics' attempts to put her on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to refuse to cooperate. She then attempted to walk away from the scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail. Scheduled to appear in Eastern Magistrates' Court on 7 April, Acting Principal Magistrate Bina Chainrai recused herself due to her familiarity with Bokhary; the defence was granted a further delay, to permit preparation of a medical assessment. She pleaded guilty on 7 July, advancing mental illness in mitigation. On 2 August, she was sentenced to 12 months' probation and a fine of HK$8,000; her driving licence was suspended for 12 months. As a condition of her probation, she would also enter a treatment programme at the Betty Ford Center in the United States. Passing sentence, magistrate Anthony Yuen Wai-ming stated that her offences would normally result in prison time, but he decided to be lenient because of her mental disorder. Yuen's comment in his judgment that Bokhary has an \\"unblemished background and was born into a good family with caring parents [and] an outstanding academic record\\" caused an uproar locally. Her resulting probation was criticised in certain quarters, notably by the police, for its leniency.\\"Slap on the wrist for slap on the face sparks review\\". AsiaOne News (5 August 2010) Between 6 and 7 August, Magistrate Yuen reviewed the case, but did not change his ruling.  Reactions  Various sectors of society expressed concern over the light sentence; the Police Inspectors' Association asked for clearer guidelines on the penalties to be expected in such cases. The Junior Police Officers' Association also complained that the probation decision could not be seen as a deterrent, but accepted that the court decision had to be respected as the magistrate \\"would have considered all factors.\\" The Standard editorial derided Yuen's reasoning as \\"unpersuasive\\". Kevin Zervos, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, requested that Yuen rethink his sentence. The police also received criticism for charging Bokhary under the Police Force Ordinance ‚Äì with a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment ‚Äì instead of the Offences Against the Person Ordinance, which carries a maximum two-year sentence. Police Director of Crime and Security Xavier Tang responded that the lesser charge had been chosen because officers believed they had a better chance of conviction ‚Äì she was said to be ready to plead guilty to assaulting police.  Public  An editorial in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) criticised Yuen's for citing her background, family, education and academic achievement as being mitigating factors, which to some implied such would \\"buy leniency from the courts\\". It summarised that \\"The failure to show any logical connection between family background and the sentence leaves the public with the perception that those with a notable surname are more equal than others.\\" With widespread criticism of his decision, the SCMP published on 7 August an explanation by Yuen, in which he said that Bokhary's behaviour was \\"consistent with the mental illness she was, and is still, suffering\\". He added that sending the defendant to \\"prison for a few months would air the grievances of the public, but would destroy the rest of the life of the defendant.\\"Magistrate Anthony Yuen (7 August 2010). \\"In his own words: how Magistrate Anthony Yuen sees the case and the sentence\\". South China Morning Post Approximately 300 people protested outside the Legislative Council Building in Central on 8 August, while another 50, among them retired policemen, joined a Liberal Party-led march from Wan Chai to the Department of Justice building. In a telephone survey of 1,100 people conducted from 10‚Äì13 August by the Hong Kong Research Association, 91% responded that they felt the sentence was too light. Another survey of 1,007 people in the same period by the University of Hong Kong found that confidence in the judiciary had fallen; respondents' ratings on \\"fairness of the judicial system\\" fell to the lowest level since October 2004, while \\"rule of law\\" indicator and confidence in the \\"impartiality of the courts\\" also declined in the month. A Facebook page complaining about the sentence had attracted 42,500 participants by 4 August. Another Facebook group allegedly inciting Hong Kong residents to slap police officers was shut down by the site's administrators. Bokhary's lawyer Peter Duncan disputes that the widespread perception for Bokhary receiving a light sentence was due to her family's wealth and connections. Under public pressure, the Department of Justice (DoJ) stated on 4 August that they were considering an appeal against Bokhary's sentence. In particular, Secretary for Justice Wong Yan-lung described Yuen's sentence as \\"inadequate\\" and stated that he would initiate a review. In a press release on 11 August, the DoJ stated that they had filed the application for leave to review with the Court of Appeal two days earlier.  Legal profession  In response to the increased negative attention on the judiciary, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong on 11 August issued a joint statement to \\"allay misgivings of the public\\" and to explain the court's approach, whilst deploring \\"any attempt to bring public pressure on a Judge or Magistrate to change his or her mind upon a review of sentence\\". Senior Counsel Martin Lee also spoke out against the protest, which he described as mob rule and detrimental to the rule of law. Lee said he would have handed down the same sentence as Yuen in light of the facts of the case. Public focus had been expected to remain on Yuen as he is also the judge handling the case of Christina Chan, the protester charged with assaulting a police officer during the 2010 Hong Kong new year march, although the chairman of the Hong Kong Police Officers' Association stated that the two cases were not comparable. Chan was acquitted of the assault on 3 September.  Pundits  Former legislator Albert Cheng noted that had Bokhary been charged under the Police Ordinance, and not the Offences Against the Person Ordinance, she would have faced a custodial sentence of up to two years; furthermore, the police failed to charge Bokhary for allegedly assaulting a policewoman at the police station after her arrest; the police also prosecuted her for careless driving instead of the more serious offence of dangerous driving. Cheng said: \\"The public certainly has the right to voice its anger against any injustice. But, in this case, its targets shouldn't be the government or the courts, but Secretary for Justice Wong Yan-lung, who is responsible for prosecutions and all government legal matters.\\"Cheng, Albert (11 August 2010). \\"Sentence too lenient, or were charges too light?\\". South China Morning Post Legislator and former Secretary for Security, Regina Ip, said: \\"At the end of the day, the sense of outrage is not about justice and penalties, but about the widening inequality between rich and poor, between the corporate giant and the artless individual, and the yawning asymmetry of money, knowledge and expert power between the haves and have-nots of our society.\\"Ip, Regina (13 August 2010). \\"One law for the rich?\\" . Savantas Policy Institute. Political commentator Michael Chugani agreed that public anger existed due to the belief that Hong Kong society had become too unfair, and that the verdict was confirmation to some of this view. He said that the public outrage responsible for forcing the Department of Justice to appeal against Bokhary's sentence was unlikely to result in a happy ending because both outcomes were potentially damaging: the jailing of Bokhary would imply the judicial system had succumbed to public pressure; if she was not jailed, the system would be tarnished by accusations of favouritism.Chugani, Michael (16 August 2010). \\"Court of opinion\\". South China Morning Post  Probation breach and jail sentence  Bokhary appeared before magistrates court on 23 December 2010 and was sentenced to six weeks in jail for breaking five out of seven conditions of her 2 August probation order ‚Äì she failed to complete three months' alcohol rehabilitation in the United States; failed to report to her probation officer or to participate in programs arranged by same as required; did not reside as directed; refused to receive psychiatric and psychological treatment. Her lawyer said Bokhary had become increasingly paranoid as a result of the media attention and felt that \\"she had become a target of abuse\\". The court rejected her bail application.Wong, Kelvin & Mao, Debra (23 December 2010). \\"Judge's Niece Is Jailed for Six Weeks for Assaulting Police in Hong Kong\\", Bloomberg Prosecution appealed the sentence ‚Äì a one-year driving ban and probation order ‚Äì imposed on Bokhary for failing to provide a breath specimen.

Los Haro was first settled by Spanish immigrants over 400 years ago, around the same time that the first English settlements were getting started in North America. Since the time of its founding, Los Haro has had a colorful history, enduring as an independent ranching and farming community on the periphery of Spanish control. Since the 1950s men have traveled to work in the vineyards and wineries of Napa, California; there are now some 200 families living and working in Napa; other families have settled in Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, as well as in towns and cities in Colorado and Texas. While people have become geographically dispersed, many still see themselves as belonging to Los Haro and maintain a strong connection and a deep affection for their hometown, making this a truly \\"transnational\\" community. As of 2010, the population was of about 900. It is named after one of the original 10 families who settled the town during the 17th century. Captive prickly pear grown for food  History = Pre-Hispanic  Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the Jerez Valley was home to Chichimecas who cultivated corn and squash adjacent to the river and streams. However, for the most part this vast region of semi-arid land was the domain of bands of hunter-gatherers who successfully resisted any attempts at control by the Aztec empire in the south. The Chichimecas instilled fear upon Meso-American sedentary people thanks to their fierce tactics of lightning raids and scalping of enemies. These marksmen hunted, with bow and arrow, deer, rabbits, snakes, and rats. Zacatecas, Mexico The nopal cactus and mesquite were vital to their subsistence. From the nopal, they ate its leaves, hearts, flowers and the fruit called \\"tunas\\" and from the mesquite they made bread cakes that could be stored. Unlike their neighbors to the South, whose rich volcanic soils and rainfall made possible agriculture that could generate a considerable surplus, their semi-arid ecosystem forced substantial mobility.  Arrival of the Spaniards  In the 1540s, rich silver deposits were discovered in Zacatecas brought about the onset of a silver rush and the eventual demise of the Chichimeca hunter-gatherer ways. Spanish fortune seekers, slaves, free laborers, soldiers, priests, merchants, and administrators populated the area. Their arrival demanded a productive, sedentary agriculture. Initially, these workers obtained the necessary materials and foodstuffs from other established posts in New Spain such as Guadalajara. The arduous routes, prevalent with attacks by the Chichimeca, forced mine owners to turn to closer sources of supply, such as the Jerez Valley. The Jerez Valley was already a connection point between Fresnillo and Guadalajara. In the Jerez Valley, they could raise cattle, horses, sheep and mules to supply the mines. By the early 17th century land grants and agricultural development were beginning to take place throughout the Jerez Valley. The present-day Los Haro, adjacent to the Jerez-Fresnillo road at the northern end of the Valley, was settled in the early 1600s by a Spaniard named Tomas Gonzales. By 1700, at least 10 Spanish immigrant families were living there bearing the surnames of Aro, Hurtado, Mu√±iz de Chavez, Felix de la Cruz, and Perez. Later arrivals included the De Haros, De Loeras, Seguras, Saldivars, Casta√±edas, and Acu√±as, all of which are established family names today. A key feature that sets Los Haro apart from other towns, besides the strong continuity of these family lineages, is that from its origin it has been free and fiercely independent community of families. Unlike most of the other settlements in the Jerez Valley, it was neither established by the Spanish crown as a means of settling Indians, nor was it an hacienda where residents lived in a state of semi-slavery. The layout of the town attests its origins. Instead of the characteristic grid pattern mandated by the Council of Indies in Seville, the layout of Los Haro is rather an original one: with no central plaza to anchor the settlements, the streets and individual lot extend in ribbon-fashion along the right bank of the river, with three neighborhoods, each developing its own fresh spring water. These original neighborhoods are still identified with the town's three principal families, the De Haros in the center, the Santiagos in the northern, and the Saldivars in the south.  Colonial era  The settlers of Los Haro sought to escape the restraint of central authority by moving out to the periphery, where the Crown's power was the weakest. Of modest origin, these immigrants moved to remote terrains to buy land, intermarry with local inhabitants and to carry out livelihoods of independence and self-reliance. These pioneers came to the New World not simply to amass fortune, fame and status before returning to Spain wealthy men, but instead to settle and develop new lives for themselves, and on their own terms. As the colonial silver economy of Zacatecas developed, Los Haro found itself in the middle of large haciendas that were controlled by the Church, merchants and miners. Throughout the colonial era and into the first decade of the 20th century, Los Haro maintained a symbiotic, though uneasy, relationship with these neighboring haciendas. These haciendas were integral to the survival and productivity of the Zacatecas mining districts, which were the main engine of New Spain's silver economy for nearly 200 years.They supplied meat, hides, work animals, food and other necessities to the nearby mines. The Los Haro residents often made extended trips to neighboring communities as well as the city of Zacatecas to exchange surplus grain, livestock, cheeses, eggs, fruits, and vegetables, for cloth, tools, and other manufactured goods. These haciendas also provided the men of Los Haro with a source of employment when they needed to supplement their own family's income. More often than not, relations with adjacent haciendas were rife with conflict. The formidable haciendas had twelve-foot walls separating hacienda and town lands. These boundaries fueled conflict and resentment as the hacienda foremen and settlers clashed over water, arable land and grazing rights. In addition, Los Haro farmers and their pack animals had to pay nearby haciendas a fee to cross their vast holding on their two-day journey to market in Zacatecas, which only added conflict to the already unstable relations. These tensions would later submerge the region into years of violence and turmoil during the Mexican Revolution.  Religion  The majority of the town residents as well as their descendants are Roman Catholic.  Our Lady of Refuge of Los Haro  In the late 17th century, a parish in honor of Our Lady of Refuge of Los Haro is constructed. However, one day, the image disappeared from the altar never again to be seen, and thus was eradicated from the memories of Los Haro residents. The parish then fell into ruins.  San Rafael Arcangel  After the disappearance of the image of Our Lady of Refuge of Los Haro, the community was determined to find a saint to venerate. According to town stories, the Tesorero hacienda would lend Los Haro the San Rafael statue during the annual October town-wide celebration. However, one day the Tesorero hacienda opposed lending Los Haro the saint. Nevertheless, San Rafael appeared in Los Haro during the festival and on the way to Los Haro, small traces were recorded. The owners of the hacienda then decided to give the community of Los Haro, San Rafael. In return, Los Haro residents began the construction of a new church on April 6, 1905. The church was completed on June 6, 1906. The annual town fiesta, in late October, continues to honor San Rafael to this present day.  Culture = La Morisma  The celebration for the patron saint, San Rafael, is famous throughout Zacatecas because of the Morisma that takes place over the three days, from October 23 through the 25th. The Morisma is a grand recreation enacting a scripted drama that recounts Medieval conflict between the Christians and Muslims. These recreations date back to at least 900 years to a Spain invaded with Muslims. The Morisma is based on the Battle of Lepanto, in which Christian forces under John of Austria defeated the Turkish (Ottoman) navy in 1571, thereby impeding Muslim expansion into Europe. Don Quixote author, Miguel de Cervantes, participated in the battle and later wrote an account on it, from which the Los Haro libretto is drawn. A key feature that sets apart the Los Haro Morisma from the larger version performed at Bracho, Zacatecas, is the presence of mounted cavalry. Even though the Battle of Lepanto itself was a naval engagement off the coast of Greece, given the Los Haro terrain and the fact that riding was an integral part of everyday life, it seemed apt to substitute the galleys and display the charro skills of the brave townsmen.  Economy  The economy of Los Haro revolves around farming and agriculture. Mainly rich Plums and Peaches, but often corn.  Los Haro Summer Camp program  The Los Haro Summer Camp program began in 2007 as a pilot project to address the needs of children and youth of a border-spanning Mexican community. Thousands of Mexico-U.S. transnational communities have developed over the last half century as people have left their villages in search of jobs and opportunities in the United States. Los Haro being one of them. As with the children of Mexican immigrants in general, life for the second generation can be a confusing challenge. They are caught between two worlds and often find themselves struggling to reconcile their parents‚Äô reality with the need to function in a society that is at once unfamiliar to their parents, and full of risks for themselves. Researchers have found that the immigrant children who stay in school and do best in America are those who retain a connection with their parents‚Äô culture. Awareness and respect for their origins allows for the maintenance of strong family ties and inter-generational bonds, and provides children with a sense of self-worth that helps anchor them while they navigate the turbulence of adolescence in the United States. The Los Haro Summer Camp emerged from the concerns of the Los Haro Support Committee (Comit√© de Apoyo Los Haro), a Napa-based volunteer hometown organization. In the past, dedicated members of the Los Haro community in Napa have raised funds for a variety of projects to benefit the home village, including support for the church, to purchase an ambulance, to upgrade the potable water system, to help pave village streets, among other projects. Now this new Committee is taking a fresh approach as it seeks to address problems facing the next generation, both at home and in Napa. In August 2006 members of the Los Haro Support Committee gathered to conduct a diagnosis of their home community‚Äôs future prospects and concluded that without serious intervention their village would continue its downward spiral towards decay and abandonment as emigration to the United States continues unabated. They noted that new types of problems and tensions are emerging as increasing numbers of youth from the United States travel home to spend the summer with relatives, but once there find themselves with little to do. Adults in Los Haro report growing conflict between local and visiting youths, and a rise in vandalism, alcohol and drug abuse. In response to this situation, and in consultation with relatives and neighbors in Los Haro, the Committee decided to launch a youth-oriented program to address the need for healthy summer activities, to promote pride and respect for the village, to enhance learning opportunities for both local and visiting youth, and to build bridges of friendship between the two groups. Through community gatherings, slide shows and other presentations, the Los Haro Support Committee will be shares its experiences and lessons learned with other hometown organizations. Besides strengthening Mexican families and contributing to youth well-being and self-worth, this program builds bridges of friendship and understanding between Mexican families and the wider Napa community.

The term was first described by parapsychologist Joseph Banks Rhine in the 1930s to describe the disappearing of extrasensory perception (ESP) of psychic experiments conducted by Rhine over the course of study or time. In its more general term, Cronbach, in his review article of science \\"Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology\\" referred to the phenomenon as \\"generalizations decay.\\" The term was once again used in a 2010 article by Jonah Lehrer published in The New Yorker. Examples In his article, Lehrer gives several examples where the decline effect is allegedly showing. In the first example, the development of second generation anti-psychotic drugs, reveals that the first tests had demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the subjects' psychiatric symptoms. However, after repeating tests this effect declined and in the end it was not possible to document that these drugs had any better effect than the first generation anti-psychotics. A well-known example of the decline effect can be seen in early experiments conducted by Professor Jonathan Schooler examining the effects of verbalization on non- verbal cognition. In an initial series of studies Schooler found evidence that verbal rehearsal of previously seen faces or colors markedly impaired subsequent recognition. This phenomenon is referred to as verbal overshadowing. Although verbal overshadowing effects have been repeatedly observed by Schooler, as well as other researchers, they have also proven to be somewhat challenging to replicate. Verbal overshadowing effects in a variety of domains were initially easy to find, but then became increasingly difficult to replicate indicating a decline effect in the phenomenon. Schooler has now become one of the more prominent researchers examining the decline effect. He has argued that addressing the decline effect may require a major revision to the scientific process whereby scientists log their protocols before conducting their research and then, regardless of outcome, report their findings in an open access repository (such as Brain Nosek's \\"Project Implicit\\").http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/ Schooler is currently working with the Fetzer Foundation to organize a major meeting of scientists from various disciplines to consider alternative accounts of the decline effect and approaches for rigorously addressing it. In 1991, Danish zoologist Anders M√∏ller discovered a connection between symmetry and sexual preference of female birds in nature. This sparked a huge interest in the topic and a lot of follow-up research was published. In three years following the original discovery, 90% of studies confirmed M√∏ller's hypothesis. However, the same outcome was published in just four out of eight research papers in 1995, and only a third in next three years. Explanations One of the explanations of the effect is regression toward the mean (this is a statistical phenomenon happening when a variable is extreme on the first experiments and by later experiments tend to regress towards average), although this does not explain why sequential results decline in a linear fashion, rather than fluctuating about the true mean as would be expected. Another reason may be the publication bias: scientists and scientific journals prefer to publish positive results of experiments and tests over null results, especially with new ideas. As a result, the journals may refuse to publish papers that do not prove that the idea works. Later, when an idea is accepted, journals may refuse to publish papers that support it. In the debate that followed the original article, Lehrer answered some of the questions by claiming that scientific observations might be shaped by one's expectations and desires, sometimes even unconsciously, thus creating a bias towards the desired outcome. A significant factor contributing to the decline effect can also be the sample size of the scientific research, since smaller sample size is very likely to give more extreme results, suggesting a significant breakthrough, but also a higher probability of an error. Typical examples of this effect are the opinion polls, where those including a larger number of people are closer to reality than those with a small pool of respondents. This suggestion would not appear to account for the observed decrease over time regardless of sample size. Researcher John Ioannidis offers some explanation. He states that early research is usually small and more prone to highly positive results supporting the original idea, including early confirmatory studies. Later, as larger studies are being made, they often show regression to the mean and a failure to repeat the early exaggerated results. A 2012 report by National Public Radio's show \\"On The Media\\" covered scientists who are exploring another option: that the act of observing the universe changes the universe, and that repeated measurement might actually be rendering earlier results invalid. In other words, antipsychotic drugs did work originally, but the more we measured their effectiveness, the more the laws governing those drugs changed so they ceased to be effective. Science fiction author Geoff Ryman explores this idea and its possible ramifications further in his 2012 short story _What We Found_ , which won the Nebula Award for Best Novelette in 2012. Contesting views Several commenters have contested Jonah Lehrer's view of the decline effect being a problematic side of the phenomenon, as presented in his New Yorker article. \\"The decline effect is troubling because it reminds us how difficult it is to prove anything. We like to pretend that our experiments define the truth for us. But that's often not the case. Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe.\\" Steven Novella also challenges Lehrer's view of the decline effect, arguing that Lehrer is concentrating on new discoveries on the cutting edge of scientific research and applying the conclusions to all areas of science. Novella points out that most of the examples used by Lehrer come from medicine, psychology and ecology, scientific fields most influenced by a complex human aspect and that there is not much evidence of the decline effect in other areas of science, such as physics. Another scientist, Paul Zachary Myers, is also contesting Lehrer's view on the decline effect being a surprising phenomenon in science, claiming that: \\"This isn't surprising at all. It's what we expect, and there are many very good reasons for the shift.\\" Lehrer's statements about the difficulty of proving anything and publication bias find support from Jerry A. Coyne. Coyne holds that in the fields of genetics and evolutionary biology, almost no research is replicated and there is a premium motivation offered for publishing positive results of research studies. However, he also contests Lehrer's approach of applying conclusions on all fields of science, stating that in physics, chemistry or molecular biology, previous results are constantly repeated by others in order to progress in their own research. Criticism One concern that some have expressed is that Lehrer's article may further fuel people's skepticism about academic science. It was long believed that Lehrer's article originally hinted that academic science is not as rigid as people would like to believe. It is especially the article's ending that has upset many scientists and led to broad criticism of the article. Lehrer ends the article by saying: \\"Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe.\\" This has upset scientists in the scientific community. Many have written back to Lehrer and questioned his agenda. Some have characterized Lehrer's assertion as \\"absurd\\", while others claiming that Lehrer is trying to use publication bias as an excuse for not believing in anything. As an answer to the many comments Lehrer received upon publishing the article, Lehrer published a comment on his blog, The Frontal Cortex, where he denied that he was implicitly questioning science and scientific methods in any way. In the same blog comment, Lehrer stated that he was not questioning fundamental scientific theories such as the theory of evolution by natural selection and global warming by calling them \\"two of the most robust and widely tested theories of modern science\\". A further clarification was published as a follow-up note in The New Yorker. In this note, entitled \\"More Thoughts on the Decline Effect\\", Lehrer tries mainly to answer the critics by giving examples where scientific research has both failed and succeeded. As an example, Lehrer uses Richard Feynman's commencement speech at Caltech in 1974 as a starting point. In his commencement speech, Feynman used Robert Millikan's and Harvey Fletcher's oil drop experiment to measure the charge of an electron to illustrate how selective reporting can bias scientific results. On the other hand, Feynman finds solace in the fact that other scientists will repeat other scientists' experiments and hence, the truth will win out in the end. Lehrer once again uses the follow-up note to deny that his original intention was to support people denying well verified scientific theories such as natural selection and climate change. Instead, he wishes that \\"we'd spend more time considering the value of second-generation antipsychotics or the verity of the latest gene- association study\\". In the other parts of the follow-up note, Lehrer briefly discusses some of the creative feedback he has received in order to reduce publication bias.

The cottage-like building was erected in 1754 for General Baptists, hence its original name of the Billingshurst General Baptist Chapel, but the congregation moved towards Unitarian beliefs in the 19th century, and still maintain these. It is a member of General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella body for British Unitarians. The chapel, also known as the Billingshurst Unitarian and Free Christian Church, is one of the oldest Nonconformist places of worship in the district of Horsham‚Äîan area in which such Christian beliefs have a long and successful history; furthermore, there are few older chapels of this type anywhere in southeast England. English Heritage has listed the chapel at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History=From General Baptists In England, people and ministers who worshipped outside the Church of England but were not part of the Roman Catholic Church were historically known as Dissenters or (Protestant) Nonconformists. Nonconformism became officially recognised after the Act of Uniformity 1662, which removed from their living those Church of England ministers who refused to recognise or abide by the Act's requirements. Many alternative denominations developed, all focused on a person's personal relationship with God rather than on the rites and ceremonies of religious worship as in the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. This trend was seen throughout Sussex, and by the late 17th century \\"the all-embracing medieval Church\\" existed alongside dozens of newly established groups and denominations. One of these sects was the General Baptists. Along with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and the Presbyterians, they found significant early success in the area around the north Sussex market town of Horsham. By 1676 there were about 100 Nonconformists in the town, and the General Baptist cause was led by local radical and evangelist Matthew Caffyn. Under his guidance a General Baptist chapel was founded in the town in 1719, bringing together Baptists who had met in small house-groups since 1669 or possibly as early as 1645. Billingshurst itself The chapel has a large graveyard to the front and side. Worshippers from across northern Sussex came to this chapel; many were from the village of Billingshurst a few miles away. This group later became large enough to split from the Horsham congregation and establish a chapel in their home village. They chose a grassy, raised site set back from the west side of the High Street, and erected a modest cottage-like chapel in 1754.The Victoria County History of Sussex (1986) states, in relation to the Horsham chapel, that \\"...the Billingshurst members formed a separate congregation 1818\\". According to Stell (2002), this is in fact the date when the congregation became independent of Horsham following a membership dispute. The founders were William Turner and William Evershed, whose initials are recorded on a dated stone tablet inside. Evershed was a General Baptist preacher at Horsham who moved to a farm in Billingshurst in 1742; together with Turner he held and preached at small meetings in Billingshurst. The Evershed family had a long-lasting connection with the chapel: more than 120 Eversheds of various generations, including William himself, are buried in the graveyard, a \\"surprisingly big\\" area which surrounds the chapel and helps it \\"make a display in spite of itself\\" and its modest architecture. After making plans for a chapel in the village in 1753, Turner and Evershed bought the site for three guineas (¬£ as of ). The chapel was registered for worship in October 1754; its date of founding makes it one of the oldest Nonconformist places of worship in both the Horsham district and the whole of southeast England. The congregation, like that at Horsham, gradually moved from General Baptist beliefs towards Unitarianism in the early 19th century. The chapel took the name Billingshurst Free Christian Church and later the Billingshurst Unitarian Chapel or Billingshurst Unitarian and Free Christian Church. William Evershed also had a house in Godalming, Surrey, at which conventicles attended by hundreds of people every week took place from the mid-18th century. In 1783 the congregation decided to build a meeting house, and a General Baptist chapel (which soon became Unitarian) was erected on Meadrow six years later. It is still in use as Meadrow Unitarian Chapel. Architecture and description The chapel stands on an elevated knoll upon which modern housing has encroached. Billingshurst Unitarian Chapel is a simple Georgian Vernacular building, \\"like a demure Georgian cottage\\". It is a single storey high and has a two-window range with a gable-headed porch between the casement windows. The wide fa√ßade of three bays has been described as similar to the former Southover General Baptist Chapel (now in residential use) in Lewes, East Sussex. The walls are of glazed grey and red brickwork laid in a Flemish bond pattern, and the roof is laid with tiles. Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner noted that \\"the architecture is utterly self-effacing\\". It is a good example of the contrast between the prominently sited, \\"wealthy established parish church with its centuries of tradition\\" and \\"the small impoverished Dissenting chapel\\", which occurs frequently in Sussex towns and villages. The east side of Billingshurst High Street is dominated by St Mary's Church, with its landmark steeple and elevated position, while \\"quietly hidden\\" behind iron fencing and hedges on the west side is the Unitarian Chapel. The site measures and sits back from the High Street. The interior measures . A modest wooden gallery, supported on one pillar and with a panelled front, spans the north end of the ceiling. Some original timber tie-beams remain on the ceiling. Other interior fittings include an \\"impressive\\" clock manufactured in 1756 by Inkpen of Horsham, two coffin stools‚Äîon which a coffin would be placed before it was lowered into the grave‚Äîdating from 1787 and inscribed (James Knight, 1787), original pews including two carved with , a brass chandelier with a dove figure, and an original communion table of oak. A baptistery and vestries were added to the rear (west) elevation in the 19th century. Structural alterations were made at various times. The capacity was extended in the late 18th century when a wooden gallery was built; two named pews are dated 1788. A brick-built ground-floor extension dates from 1825, when rooms were built on the west side to house a baptistery and vestries. The baptistery was apparently roofless originally, but it was altered in 1880 or 1886 when it became a library and schoolroom. At the same time, the pulpit was moved from its original position near the entrance door to the wall on the south side, where it remains. The chapel is still set in the middle of its original graveyard, but modern housing development on the west side has come close to the boundaries, affecting the setting. The original approach from the east, along a small uneven path in a narrow gap between surrounding buildings (which almost hide the chapel from view from the High Street), survives. The chapel was described in these terms by a 19th-century writer:Unattributed; quoted by Beevers, Marks & Roles (1989). The chapel today The interior seen from the gallery Billingshurst Unitarian Chapel was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 22 September 1959; this defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest As of February 2001, there were 1,628 Grade II listed buildings, and 1,726 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Horsham. The chapel is a member of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella organisation for British Unitarians. In 2012 the congregation set up \\"Evershed Arts\\", using the Old Library Room as an artspace to promote artistic expression in the local area.Between September 2014 and January 2015, the building was renovated, partly funded through English Heritage Lottery funding and partly through the fund raising efforts of the congregation. At this time, the congregation undertook a rebranding exercise and whilst it officially and constitutionally remains Billingshurst Unitarian Chapel, it is informally known as 'The Chapel.'

Evolutionary psychology assumes that our thinking, feeling and doing are the product of innate psychological mechanisms. These mechanisms have evolved because they enable people to effectively deal with situations that (directly or indirectly) are important for survival and reproduction (reproductive success). Evolutionary theory suggests that both leadership and followership were important for the reproductive success of our ancestors. Evolutionary leadership theory was introduced by Professor Mark van Vugt, Professor of social and organizational psychology (VU University Amsterdam and University of Oxford) in the book Selected: Why Some People lead, Why Others Follow and Why it Matters (Van Vugt & Ahuja, 2010). In the earlier German books \\"Evolution√§re F√ºhrung\\" (2006) and \\"Nat√ºrlich f√ºhren\\" (2013) by Dipl.-Psych. Michael Alznauer (Germany) the theme of leadership is also approached from an evolutionary viewpoint but with a slightly different focus. The theory distinguishes itself from other theories of leadership by stating that: * leading and following are adaptive behavioural strategies that have evolved to solve social coordination problems in ancestral groups (e.g. moving to new areas, big game hunting or conflicts with other groups). * the relationship between leaders and followers is fundamentally ambivalent. The leader can abuse his position of power for his own benefit at the expense of others (see also the section leadership and dominance). * modern organizational structures are sometimes inconsistent with innate psychological mechanisms of leading and following. This inconsistency is one possible explanation for the problems in the relationship between managers and subordinates in modern organizations. Evolution of Leadership Humans evolved as social animals. The group offers protection and cooperation in hunting, gathering and sharing food to make group membership attractive to the individual. Some form of coordination may benefit group activities. Research shows that groups with leaders generally do better than groups without a leader. The core premise of evolutionary leadership theory (ELT) is that the primary function of leadership lies in facilitating group performance and effectiveness. Considerations for followers If leadership benefits group performance then it is in the evolutionary interests of individuals to follow. ELT uses game theory to show that it is often more attractive for individuals to follow or not follow. When deciding whether or not to follow the individual will have two considerations: # the added value of following a leader # who is the right person to follow in this particular situation Evolutionary leadership theory assumes that these considerations (and other considerations about followership) are affected by evolved psychological mechanisms. These \\"instincts\\" determine the way we respond to leaders (even in modern times). We see that when there is no clear need for leadership, people react negatively to attempts to influence them. Leader prototypes (CALP) Evolutionary leadership theory suggests that in deciding whom to follow people use evolved cognitive leader prototypes. These prototypes are called \\"cognitive ancestral leader prototypes\\" CALP. The CALPs help people choose the best person to lead in a specific situation. In times of conflict, this is a physically strong and younger masculine individual not afraid to take risks. In peacetime, this is usually a more feminine person or older person with more social skills. We still see these decision rules in our modern age, as do people in times of crisis still automatically select a Big Man. Leadership and dominance Leadership is often confused with social dominance as we see in other social species. When animals compete for limited resources (food, territory, sexual partners), the stronger animals benefit at the expense of the weak. By submitting to its stronger peer they avoid an aggressive act from the dominant animal. The dominance hierarchy reduces violence in the group. This kind of dominance hierarchy is also characteristic of other great apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Dominance is difficult within species in which cooperation is important (such as humans). Weaker animals can form coalitions to attack stronger animals, something we see happening for example in chimpanzees. In human evolution, cooperation has led to a reversal of the balance of power. Someone is not a leader because he is able to dominate, but because his abilities benefit the group. Studies of hunter gatherers (people who live like our ancestors) also show that there is no formal power relations, and attempts to dominate the group are punished. The leader leads by consent of the group. The position of leader has obvious evolutionary advantages. A good leader has great respect and prestige, and this may translate into greater privileges and more sexual liaisons. The problem of power Power is still a relevant factor for humans, making it possible to increase own interests at the expense of others (as we see in dominance hierarchy). People therefore prefer to follow leaders who show integrity and generosity. In hunter-gatherer societies there are a number of corrective mechanisms to keep leaders in check * gossip (damaging the reputation and thus the prestige). * criticism (correct behaviour) * disobedience (making him ineffective as a leader) * departure (separating the group) * murder (turning off the leader and thus make way for another leader) In evolutionary leadership theory such correction mechanisms are called \\"strategies to overcome the powerful\\" (STOPs). The mismatch hypothesis The mismatch hypothesis in ELT is a variation on the savanna principle that plays an important role in evolutionary psychology. The Savanna principle states that our brains have evolved to help humans survive in a specific environment, namely small nomadic groups on the savanna of Africa. This condition is called the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA. Because the modern conditions differ in critical respects from the EEA, some innate psychological mechanisms may not be functional any more. A good example is our preference for sweet, salty and fatty foods. Leadership in modern organizations differs in critical respects from the leadership in the EEA. Examples include: * Physical and biological factors such as sex and stature still play an important role in the selection of leaders (managers are usually male and taller, on average, than subordinates) which may not be functional in modern organizations. * Leaders no longer emerge from the group bottom up but they are usually assigned top down. * Nowadays leaders have a lot more power over group members. * Modern forms of organization limit the STOP correcting mechanisms (e.g. criticism and disobedience are often not an option). Relevance to modern management With the rise of knowledge it appears that the traditional hierarchical relationships are increasingly undesirable and irrelevant. Turning subordinates into followers is a key success factor for organizations and employees will expect to be able to take more initiatives and show entrepreneurship. This fits well with the ideas from evolutionary leadership theory and this theory should have a role in future developments in the field of leadership. Understanding the innate evolved psychology of leadership allows us to counter the negative effects of mismatch and find a form of leadership that leads to a more desirable work culture and more effective organizations.

History The battle had its origin in the decision of Arduin the Lombard, a Greek-speaking Lombard who had fought for the Byzantines, to change sides and form a coalition with the Normans Rainulf Drengot and the Hauteville brothers (William Iron Arm, Drogo, Humphrey), and the Lombards Atenulf of Benevento and Argyrus of Bari. Once having defeated the imperial armies, they would take for themselves the conquered lands. The Byzantine catepan of Italy, Michael Dokeianos, moved from Bari with the few troops he could muster, including some Varangians, troops from the Opsikion tagma and several Thracesians. He was able to defeat the first rebel troops he met, and he pursued them at Ascoli Satriano. Here he was met by an army of 300 Norman Knights and 600 infantry under Rainulf Drengot, Arduin and William Iron Arm. Prior to the battle Dokeianos sent an envoy to the Lombard-Norman army to give them a choice of returning to Lombard territory or to fight the numerically superior Byzantine Army. Once the envoy was done giving the terms, Hugh Touboeuf, the Norman knight who had been holding the reins to the envoy's mount-killed the horse by hitting it in the back of the head with his gauntlet. After the envoy was given another horse he was sent back to Dokeianos with the Normans' reply choosing battle. The rebels had deployed the cavalry in the centre, with the infantry on the wings. The Byzantines launched several waves of attacks against the Norman cavalry. However, the Normans resisted and counter-attacked, defeating the Byzantines with a decisive cavalry charge. The Greek troops fled, and many of them drowned in the river. The catepan himself was barely able to escape alive. The battle of Olivento was the first of the numerous successes scored by the Normans in their conquest of southern Italy. After the battle, they conquered Ascoli, Venosa, Gravina di Puglia. It was followed by other Normans victories over the Byzantines in the battles of Montemaggiore and Montepeloso.

Born in Ulmarra, New South Wales, he graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1940. Graham subsequently held a series of regimental and staff appointments, serving in a number of infantry and armoured units during the Second World War. In the post-war period he served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, and held a number of staff and command positions in the Armoured Corps. In the late 1950s he was posted to Army Headquarters, and later served as Director of Military Intelligence. Commanding the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) during fighting in South Vietnam during 1967, he was responsible for establishing the controversial barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast. Later, Graham filled a range of senior command, staff and diplomatic roles in Australia and overseas, including the position of Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), before retiring in 1977. He died in 1996. Early life Graham was born in Ulmarra, New South Wales, on 23 October 1920, and was educated at Grafton High School. Highly intelligent, he did well at school and achieved a high position in the Leaving Certificate. After joining the Australian Army in January 1938, at the age of 19 he graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC) in August 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War. He was subsequently allocated to the Armoured Corps as a regular officer in the Permanent Military Force (PMF) with the rank of lieutenant. At Duntroon Graham had excelled academically and was known for his unorthodox and innovative tactical solutions to military problems. Top of his graduating class, he received the Kings Medal for his achievements. Shortly after his commissioning he married Joyce Lawrence of Canberra on 20 August 1940, and the couple later had two sons‚ÄîStuart born in 1941, and Ray born in 1944. Military career=Second World War Graham subsequently held a series of regimental and staff appointments, serving in a number of infantry and armoured units. Volunteering for overseas service, he transferred to the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) on 26 July 1941. He was subsequently posted to the 2/11th Armoured Car Regiment as the adjutant, followed by attendance at the Staff School. Promoted to captain in September 1942, Graham briefly served on the headquarters of the 1st Armoured Division before being attached to the British Army. Serving with the British 7th Armoured Division, he saw action with them in the North Africa and Italy 1943‚Äì44. Coming ashore on the first day of the Allied landing at Salerno, he was wounded but remained on duty. During this period he gained valuable operational experience in armoured warfare; while his service in North Africa may also have shaped his thinking about the use of tactical minefields which had been used extensively during the mobile infantry and armoured battles of 1941‚Äì42. After returning to Australia in February 1944, following a short period in staff positions Graham spent the remainder of the war in the South- West Pacific. Seconded to the infantry, in December 1944 he was given command of a company from the 24th Battalion and went on to distinguish himself during the Bougainville campaign in 1945. During an action on the morning of 17 April C Company, under Graham's command, encountered heavy resistance in thick jungle while attacking strong Japanese positions around Andersons Junction, astride Dawe Creek. Personally leading the attack, he placed a number of anti- tank guns to cover a river crossing and following heavy fighting the Australians finally secured a foothold by late in the afternoon which allowed a bridge to be erected across the creek for the tanks to move forward in support. After repelling a Japanese counter-attack overnight, the following morning Graham led his company forward and succeeded in seizing the high ground after another day of bitter fighting that resulted in heavy Japanese casualties. He was immediately awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his leadership. Graham was later wounded amid heavy fighting in difficult terrain as the Australian advance continued along the Buin Road in May. Promoted temporary major in October 1945, he finished the war posted to the 2/4th Armoured Regiment. Post-war period Following the war, Graham served in various staff positions in Eastern Command based in New South Wales, and in 1946 he was posted to Japan on the Headquarters of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Interim Army, he later briefly commanded the 2nd Battalion, Australian Regiment (2 AR) between 23 November 1948 and 10 January 1949. In 1949 Graham was again attached to Headquarters Eastern Command, before subsequently being posted as a tactics instructor to RMC during 1950‚Äì51. He later completed further training in the United Kingdom and Germany in 1952. Considered one of Australia's foremost tank experts, Graham commanded the 1st Armoured Regiment during 1952‚Äì53. He subsequently served as commandant of the Armoured School between 1953 and 1956, and filled the position of Director of Armour during the same period. He later wrote an influential paper on the successful use of armour in jungle warfare and its ability to reduce casualties among the infantry. Graham attended the United States Armed Forces Staff College and subsequently filled the role of Assistant Military Attach√© in Washington, D.C. as an intelligence officer in 1957‚Äì58. His exposure to US military culture and intelligence during this period affected his own military thinking and would be influential during his later service. Graham was subsequently posted to Army Headquarters in Canberra in the Directorate of Military Operations and Plans in 1959. After being promoted to colonel, he served as Director of Military Intelligence between 1960 and 1964, and while the Australian Army was developing its own doctrine on counter-revolutionary warfare, Graham's ideas on counter- insurgency were influenced by a visit to South Vietnam in November 1961. Graham's understanding of the challenges of the prevailing Cold War environment allowed him to reform Australia's nascent military intelligence apparatus, encouraging developments in joint intelligence arrangements with Australia's allies and fostering liaison with his British and US counterparts, as well as establishing relationships with countries in South-East Asia. In recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1963. He then took up an appointment as commandant of the Jungle Training Centre (JTC) at Canungra, Queensland in 1964. The Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) was being prepared for deployment during this time, and Army officers were learning new tactics, techniques and procedures. Promoted to brigadier in 1965 he then commanded the 6th Task Force in southern Queensland, supervising the training of 2 RAR and 6 RAR, both battalions which would later serve under his command in Vietnam. In 1966, Graham studied at the Imperial Defence College in London. Vietnam War On 1 January 1967 Graham was appointed Commander 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) which was based in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam, taking over from Brigadier David Jackson. According to Ian McNeill and Ashley Ekins, the official historians of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, Graham quickly established himself, and developed a sound operational concept, yet the Viet Cong succeeded in preventing him from implementing it as he had intended. With just two battalions 1 ATF's ability to generate combat power was severely limited, while its location at Nui Dat isolated it from the main population centres and increased the burden of self- protection. During February 1967 1 ATF had sustained its heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week, the majority during Operation Bribie after 6 RAR had clashed with two companies from the Viet Cong D445 Battalion reinforced by North Vietnamese regulars, north-west of Hoi My on 17 February. To Graham such losses underscored the need for a third infantry battalion and tanks, yet with the Australian government unable to provide additional military resources at that time, they confirmed in his mind the need to establish a physical barrier to deny the Viet Cong freedom of movement. Graham subsequently established an long barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast during Operation Leeton (6 March ‚Äì 1 June) in an attempt to regain the initiative. While largely forced on Graham by the inadequate forces available and the inherent contradictions of Australian strategic policy, his decision was contrary to the advice of the senior task force engineer, Major Brian Florence. A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea, including one of Graham's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, commanding officer 5 RAR, who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces. Yet unlike many of his colleagues, as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea, and many of the assumptions he developed about mine warfare in North Africa had remained unchallenged. For the first six months the barrier minefield had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration, reducing re-supply movement by up to 80 percent. However, recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them, the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it, cutting gaps in the fence and clearing lanes through the minefield to restore the flow of supplies, as well as lifting mines for their own use. Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier minefield ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines, many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF. While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter-insurgency doctrine, Graham's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly, and despite initial success, the minefield became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later the decision was made to remove it amid growing casualties. Yet such flaws were not immediately obvious and by the second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population's sense of security. During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Senior command After returning to Australia, Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff, Northern Command in December 1967. By 1969 a large percentage of Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines, including significant quantities of M16 anti-personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier minefield at Dat Do. Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded, a figure which constituted approximately 11 percent of those killed during the war. These losses increasingly became a political issue as support for the war in Australia waned, and the efficacy of the decision was later criticised, both within the military and in the media. As the controversy surrounding the minefield grew, in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board, positions he held until 1972. Meanwhile, after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the minefield had been sound, it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian mistakes of the war. By August 1969 work had begun to remove the minefield. Graham was forced to publicly defend his decision, while questions were raised about the knowledge and approval of his decision as the tactical commander by a number of senior Army officers, including then Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, the Chief of General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Daly, and the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Sir John Wilton, all of whom had acquiesced to its construction. Meanwhile, as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army. During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam, arguing that it was necessary to further expand the Regular Army. He later managed the draw-down of Australian forces in Vietnam, and played a leading role in shaping the post-war Army. Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Command in 1972 and a year later Commander 1st Division. He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974‚Äì76. Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1975 Birthday Honours. He retired in March 1977. Later life In his later life Graham and his wife settled on the Gold Coast in Queensland and were involved in community activities and fundraising. He enjoyed swimming and fishing and was involved in work to help the blind. He died at his home on the Isle of Capri on 20 July 1996 and was survived by his widow and two sons. Despite the debate surrounding the laying of the barrier minefield, McNeill and Ekins later described Graham as a \\"clever and imaginative\\" commander, who was \\"widely regarded as having one of the best minds in the army\\", and whose \\"broad knowledge and fair approach earned him the respect of his subordinates.\\" Yet even in death Graham remained a controversial figure. In his book, The Minefield, published in 2007, author and former Army officer Greg Lockhart argued that the decision to establish the minefield had been \\"reckless\\"; the product of a failure to understand the prevailing nature of the insurgency in Phuoc Tuy Province, it had ended in \\"strategic disaster\\". Lockhart argued that the decision ultimately cost Graham the position of CGS, even though he had been seen by some as being the likely candidate to replace Daly. He went on to describe Graham as ambitious and career-driven, \\"...a talented man who rose to a position of some importance and was undone by inescapable personal flaws.\\" NotesReferences * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1920 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Defence Studies Category:Australian Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Australian generals Category:Australian military personnel of World War II Category:Australian military personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Australian Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from New South Wales Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Royal Military College, Duntroon graduates ","title":"Stuart Clarence Graham"},{"id":"31644460","text":"Gjorgji Ky√ßyku Stadium is a stadium in Pogradec, Albania.

The ships sailed 6 July for Gladstone but another engine failure in Kiara required towing and taking an inshore route to avoid heavy seas offshore. On 9 July, after fueling, the ships departed Gladstone for Townsville with further engine breakdowns and towing during that transit. On reaching Townsville Kiara was placed on a slip for repairs and both ships were painted. On 15 July both ships sailed for Cairns, reached 16 July, where more engine repairs were made to Kiara's port engine and minor fire damage to wiring repaired in Southern Cross. After a picnic sponsored by the Cairns Junior Auxiliary Anzac Club and taking on extra fuel the ships departed 21 July for Thursday Island where Kiara took on fuel from the reserve in Southern Cross. On 27 July the ships sailed for Darwin but overheating in Southern Cross's starboard engine on 28 July required a stop and some repairs. At anchorage at Elcho Island the next day Kiara was fueled again from reserves in Southern Cross before the ships departed for Darwin. On 1 August the ships arrived at Darwin.

On 28 July Southern Cross with departed Darwin with Australian troops bound for Saumlaki but Japanese forces landed there on 30 July with occupation forces. The small Dutch force there mistook the Japanese ships for the Australian ships and were overrun before the Australian forces arrived. After successful landings the Japanese ships withdrew. Southern Cross suffered an engine casualty and was delayed with Chinampa entering the occupied harbor alone and attempting an unsuccessful landing. On arrival of Southern Cross both ships attempted to land the force but were met by heavy fire and withdrew. Both ships arrived with the troops at Darwin on 2 August 1942.

The banner was painted by Mark Crocker. Street Arts Community Theatre Company was a theatre company in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was founded in October 1982 in West End, Brisbane, by Denis Peel, Pauline Peel, Steve Capelin and Andrea Lynch.Milne, Geoffrey, Theatre Australia (un)limited: Australian theatre since the 1950s, Rodopi, 2004 Street Arts was preceded in Brisbane by the agitprop ensemble the Popular Theatre Troupe. While continuing in the Popular Theatre Troupe's tradition of satire and radical political commentary, the Street Arts approach was to create theatre and circus by enabling disadvantaged communities. This became the dominant community arts methodology in Queensland in the mid-1980s, attracting funding from Australian arts boards including the Community Arts Board and Performing Arts Board.Challenging the Centre: Two Decades of Political Theatre. Edited by Steve Capelin. Brisbane: Playlab Press, 1995 , (Pbk) In 1997 it changed its focus to interdisciplinary public art and renamed itself The Arterial Group Inc. It deregistered as an association in 2014. Beginnings In 1982, after returning to Brisbane, Steve Capelin and his partner Andrea Lynch formed Street Arts with Pauline and Denis Peel to give a focus to their community arts activities. Pauline and Denis Peel had been involved in community arts projects in Edinburgh public-housing areas, Scotland, in 1980. In the same year Steve Capelin was a member of WEST Community Theatre's clown troupe in Melbourne. All three had been teachers in the Queensland education system and were strongly influenced by Ian Reece's Children's Activity Group and the community arts director Neil Cameron. In 1982 Street Arts successfully applied for funding from the Australia Council. They were known to outgoing Director Andrea Hull, who had admired the Peels' work in Scotland. The incoming director of the Community Arts Board was John Hawkes, one of the founding principals in Circus Oz. Hawkes was well disposed towards political theatre with a mix of circus and rock'n'roll. Street Arts' first funded project was the 1983 Community Circus Festival in West End, featuring circus workshops at schools and in public halls. Key participants included clown Tony Hannan, writer-director-performer Meg Kanowski, musical director Peter Stewart and circus performer Derek Ives. Personnel and projects The period 1982-1986 saw Street Arts involved in 28 projects including residencies, company shows, and large community events. Therese Collie, who had been part of the Popular Theatre Troupe joined as writer-director-performer. Later coordinators included Fiona Winning, Kara Miller and Cynthia Irvine. Kath Porrill, a former member of the Grin and Tonic Theatre Troupe as well as Popular Theatre Troupe, Gavan Fenelon of Order by Numbers, and Roger Rosser of the Popular Theatre Troupe were key players. The company often hired top billing guest artists. Inala In Cabaret in 1983 involved several women who went on to form Icy Tea ‚Äì a professional women's theatre company. In 1984 a large scale outdoor event Once upon Inala, written by Nick Hughes who had worked with the Popular Theatre Troupe was performed to a crowd of 1500 in Kev Hooper Park, with a cast of over 100, including large puppets and a live band. In 1984 Street Arts was contracted by John Stanwell, Griffith University's Community Arts Officer for Brisbane-South and Logan City, to work on a large high school project The Logan City Story written by Pat Cranney, music by Danny Fine and directed by Richard Collins, staged in the centre court of Woodridge Plaza Shopping Centre. In the same year Street Arts conceived a touring show of Rites, Wrongs and Off-beat Thongs with writer Phil Sumner formerly of Melbourne's WEST Community Theatre. In 1986, Street Arts most successful year, the company produced the Art in Working Life project Sweeping Statements and created an offshoot that became Rock'n'Roll Circus, the brainchild of circus performer Lachlan McDonald. A two-week season of rock'n'roll circus performances at the Rialto Theatre in West End was a success. The participants wanted to continue and formed Rock'n'Roll Circus in 1987. The Paint Factory years In 1987 Street Arts moved to a disused warehouse known as the Paint Factory a venue lacking kitchen, washing facilities or toilets, yet surviving as the base of the company for the next five years. During its period as a venue the Paint Factory hosted 11 Street Arts shows, eight Rock'n'Roll Circus shows and became something of a community arts centre. Porta-Loos were hired when required. In 1988 Street Arts responded to the International exposition held at South Bank, Brisbane, Expo 88 by highlighting the plight of the homeless displaced by property development and rising rents in two shows, High Rent Low Life and Underwraps written by Kerry O'Rourke and directed by Meg Kanowski. The late 1980s saw Street Arts working with local Murri people on Jalalu Jalu: Land, Law and Lies and Thru Murri Eyes. Follow ups to this direction were works in Logan City with Hugh Watson as writer, Sarah Moynihan as visual artist and Rebecca Lister as cultural liaison. Much debate has been aired around the role of the funding bodies in shaping the direction of the later projects of Street Arts, especially the Australia Council's Performing Arts Board, which seemed at the time to be requiring high standards of traditional theatre as a prerequisite for funding. Whether or not this was truly the case, the feeling that it was influenced artistic decisions and to some extent took the wind out of Street Arts' sails. Quick Quick Slow known as the Dance Marathon project, based in Ipswich was a lackluster affair. The final years In 1990 and 1991 Therese Collie's Out of the Blue, a project with women in prisons that toured successfully through the Queensland prison system. At the same time the difficulties of maintaining a large venue with very primitive facilities were proving insurpassable and Street Arts moved into a smaller office in Boundary Street, somewhat demoralised, wondering whether or not to fold. The Joh Bjelke-Petersen era had come to an end after the Fitzgerald Inquiry of 1987 and 1988 found evidence of official corruption in the police force. Street Arts was without its obvious target, yet writer-director Therese Collie and others felt there much work to do with disadvantaged communities. This period featured Liveable Streets with writer Catherine Fargher, visual artist Kath Porrill and visual artist Pat Zuber. The tenth anniversary of Street Arts was celebrated with The Next Stop West End Magical Mystery Bus Tour and the Street Arts Tenth Birthday Party at South's Leagues Club. A soul-searching analysis was undertaken by the new Street Arts team, occurring during a very quiet 1993, after which the company continued with modest success through the 1990s.

The genus is found from Costa Rica to tropical South America. Ecology A number of Duroia species, and possibly all, are capable of biochemical interactions inhibiting the growth of neighbouring plants. Analysis of root extracts from Duroia hirsuta have yielded a strong plant growth inhibitor plumericin, a tetracyclic iridoid lactone. This process, common amongst plants, is termed allelopathy. In the case of Duroia hirsuta, the chemical inhibitor is aided by the leafcutter ant Myrmelachista schumanni resident on and in the tree, and playing an active role in suppressing and destroying plant growth in the vicinity of their host by injecting and spraying formic acid. The area around the understory species Duroia hirsuta is often devoid of all other plant types, leading to the local name 'Devil's garden'. The cost to the host plant for this protection is considerable, since the resident ants subject the tree to increased leaf cutting. Species *Duroia amapana Steyerm. *Duroia aquatica (Aubl.)

History Belgium had set up the SNETA in 1919 to study the possibilities and options of civilian air transport. In Europe, Sabena was created as a result, in their African colony the Belgians created CENAC (Comit√© d' Etude pour la Navigation A√©rienne du Congo), which would evolve into the Ligne Aerienne du Roi Albert, so named after Albert I of Belgium who was a driving force behind the project in 1920. The possibility of exploiting an aerial route along the Congo River was studied under the leadership of Emile Allard, civil engineer, and Mr Michaux, a military officer. Routes and Destinations The airline had only a short life, first opening a leg from Kinshasa (formerly Leopoldville) to Gombe on July 1, 1920. The second leg, from Gombe to Lisala was opened on March 3, 1921. On July 1, 1921, exactly one year after the initial flight, the entire route from Kinshasa to Kisangani () was finally opened, but operations were discontinued on June 7, 1922. * Leopoldville * Ngombe * Lisala * Stanleyville Fleet * Levy Lepen hydroplane LARA operated six French-built Levy Lepen HB2 hydroplanes upstream along the Congo River. This choice was dictated by the absence of any landing sites along the route. The aircraft were also used to photograph and map the area. The airline was the very first one set-up by a European colonial power overseas. In total were covered during the airline's short life, amounting to 80 round trips, carrying 95 passengers and 2 tons of mail. Demise After its demise in 1922, a Congo local network was set up in 1925 by Sabena, operating Handley-Page W8 trimotors, followed by a regular Belgium-Congo link in 1935 using Fokker VIIs.

Established in 1946, it is the oldest of the 3 service academies of Korea. The school educates naval midshipmen for commissioning primarily into the Republic of Korea Navy and the Republic of Korea Marine Corps, and is administered by a superintendent with the rank of vice admiral. Location The ROKNA is located in Jinhae, a district of Changwon, South Korea. Jinhae is almost completely surrounded by mountains covered with pine trees. This city is famous for its annual cherry blossom festival every spring. The cherry blossom festival in Jinhae is called Gunhangje (Naval Port Festival). It was started since 1963, and it is an artistic and cultural event. It also has global events with the promotion of arts and flowers. The reason why the Naval Academy is located in Jinhae is that Jinhae is a strategically important location. Before ROKNA was founded, the Japanese army used Jinhae as a military base. It's an ideal spot. There are many islands in the sea in front of the Naval Academy. It makes waves weaker, so the port is relatively safe. Also it makes it hard to access for the enemy. Campus Choongmoo-Gwan The first thing is Choongmoo-Gwan. It's the headquarters of the Naval Academy. It was built in January 2002. A lot of officers work in here and they make everything about the programs that are related to the Naval Academy. The superintendent works in this building, too. It's situated in the center of the Naval Academy. Tonghae-Gwan Tonghae Center is the latest building in the ROKNA. It consists of many kinds of classrooms which have sophisticated facilities. A school library and DVD center is very useful for midshipmen. Sebyung-Gwan Sebyung-Gwan is a dormitory for midshipmen. All midshipmen stay in here. The name of the building derives from the building used by Admiral Yi. This building contains modern technology. This building can be divided into two parts: east and west. One company lives in each sector. On the sixth floor is Myeong-ryang Hall which is a dining place. Admissions The number of admitted applicants can be changed, but admitted applicants include 10% females. 90% of total applicants must be men and 10% of total applicants must be women.

Curriculum Midshipmen can choose from nine majors: naval architecture, weapons systems, electrical engineering, management science, oceanography, computer science, military strategy, international relations, and foreign language. The beginning of midshipmen's curriculum is semi-entrance training. It includes hard level military training and learning a soldier's spirit. During this period, just normal citizens and high school students become soldiers. After five weeks long training, new freshmen enter the Naval Academy officially. At this time, they declare that they will dedicate their life to keep the peace and fight for justice. As new freshmen come in, seniors graduate. The duty changing ceremony and honor company appointment ceremony takes place with it. Because of the combination inaugural ceremony, only the graduation ceremony takes place in the Naval Academy. After this ceremony, the first semester begins. About three weeks after beginning the semester, the bottom transfer ceremony takes place. It has five parts: martial arts, dancing, singing band, singing together, and symbols. From this time, freshmen's title is changed to \\"bottom,\\" and they learn about \\"bottom life.\\" First semester midterm exam: This is the first examination of the year. Midshipmen take an exam without any supervisor. First semester's final exam: This is the last exam of the first semester. Military practice: After the end of the first semester, midshipmen get a military practice and freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors each get different practice. Combat swimming: Midshipmen practice swimming for a week and swim around the 'Seo-do' island, 5 km long. The parade of Armed Forces Day: This is one of the most important events to the Korean Armed Forces. The midshipmen in the ROKNA take part in this day and have a parade. For this annual event, the midshipmen exercise from one week to two weeks. Also for that day, all cadets in Korea take part in the parade. Practice and Training Plebe Training (Boot Camp) The training is for plebes and its purpose is becoming a soldier from a civilian student. The training generally starts in the middle of January and ends after five weeks in the middle of February. It consists of five weeks called: Obedience, Patience, Perseverance, Victory, and Honor. Plebes discipline their bodies and spirits needed to be midshipmen and learn basic things about the Navy through this training. Practice Amphibious Operation (Freshman) The purpose of this practice is understanding the Marine Corps and disciplining themselves for stronger bodies and spirit during four weeks in Pohang in July. Freshmen experience Marine‚Äôs amphibious operation, ranger training and airborne training. Practice Maritime and Adapting Ship (Sophomore) The purpose of this practice is understanding basic things about ships and the Navy and adapting to a maritime environment.

The majority of the Hajongs are settled in India. Hajongs are predominantly rice farmers. They are said to have brought wet-field cultivation to Garo Hills, where the Garo people used slash and burn method of agriculture.Ahmad, S., A. Kim, S. Kim, and M. Sangma. (2005). The Hajong of Bangladesh: A sociolinguistic survey. http://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/42943. Hajong have the status of a Scheduled Tribe in India.Research paper by Dr. Khema Sonowal (2014). Tribes of North-East India: A Study on ‚ÄòHajongs‚Äô http://theglobaljournals.com/gra/file.php?val=February_2014_1393595039_2cd81_83.pdf Origin Hajong women fishing with 'Jakha/Jakhei' a traditional fishing implement. The Hajong belong to the Indo-Tibetan group. Hajongs are ethnically related to Garo and Koch, Garos after using plough introduced themselves as Hajong and the Hajongs after giving up non-hindu practices became Koch. There are different opinions on the origin of the tribe, its name, and migration to India. Some authors, like evangelist Sidney Endle and B.C. Allen opined that the Hajongs are an offshoot of the greater \\"Bodo race\\", in accordance with both fundamentalist Christian and racialist theories of community popular at the time among the societies of European colonial powers. They had come from the Tibetan Plateau, modern day Qinghai, to North-east India along the Brahmaputra and Tista rivers and their tributaries and had spread over in the Sankush Valley. The Hajongs claim that their ancestral home was in Hajo area of present-day Nalbari district of Assam. The meaning of 'Hajong' can be comprehended as 'descendants of Hajo'.Hajong, B. (2002). The Hajongs and their struggle. Assam, Janata Press. p. 2-3. According to a legend popularly prevalent among the Hajongs, they are Suryawanshi (Surjo bung-shi in Hajong) or the descendants of Surjo or Bila (the deity of the Sun) and are Kshatriyas.Hajong, B. (2002). The Hajongs and their struggle. Assam, Janata Press. p. 1-2. They are one of the least studied endogamous Bodo-Kachari tribe having a trans-border international presence in North-east India and in Bangladesh. Clans of Hajong Tribes The Hajongs have five different clans (Hajong Bhasa: Nikni). Marriage within the same clan is prohibited. Their culture slightly differs from clan to clan : :* Korebari :* Doskin√¢ :* Su- Sungy√¢ :* Barohazari :* Mesp√¢ry√¢ Marriage Hajongs are endogamous people.Hajong, B. (2002). The Hajongs and their struggle. Assam, Janata Press. p. 29. In Hajong society matriarchy declined with the influence of Hinduism, leading towards the growing dominance of patriarchy in Hajong society. Within Hajong culture, romantic love and widow remarriage was allowed, and monogamy was the norm for the Hajong people. Exorbitant dowry system was absent in the Hajong society. The Hajongs would give a tolerable bride price called p«ín. Widows are allowed to remarry and this type of marriage is called Hang'a or Sang'a in Hajong. Religion The Hajongs are Hindus and observe Hindu rites and customs. It is not known when the process of Hinduisation began. The animistic beliefs are still prevalent among the Hajongs. Not much is known about the customs and beliefs of their pre-Hindu period. A traditional Hajong Granary has no doors in order to prevent the goddess of wealth and fortune, Lukkhi Dyao, from running away. Geographical distribution The Hajong people are spread out across northeast India and Bangladesh with the majority of the population on the India side of the border. In India, Hajongs are found in both the Garo and Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, largely along the South-West Garo Hills District of Meghalaya and Bangladesh border. They also live in the Dhubri and Goalpara districts of lower Assam, Dhemaji and other districts of upper Assam into Arunachal Pradesh.Kinny, E. and I. Zeliang. (2005). A Sociolinguistic survey among the Hajong of India. Unpublished manuscript. In Bangladesh, Hajongs are found in the northern Dhaka division, although there are unconfirmed reports of some Hajong living in Chittagong division. The narrow strip of borderland that stretches from Sherpur district in the west as far Sunamganj district in the east can be considered the southern outpost of the greater Hajong community. Language Hajong people have their own language which was originally a Tibeto-Burman language,Hajong, B. (2002). The Hajongs and their struggle. Assam, Janata Press. Foreword(2) by Satyendra Narayan Goswami 2001. but is now considered an Indo-Aryan language with Tibeto-Burman roots. It is spoken by more than 175,000 ethnic Hajong. It is written in the Eastern Nagari script. It has mostly Prakrit loan words. Hajong phonology has an extra vowel /…Ø/ (similar to some dialects of Assamese) which is not present in other Indo-Aryan languages, but is typical for the Tibeto- Burman family.Guts, Y. (2007). Phonological description of the Hajong language. Masters Thesis. Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit; p 59. The phonology of Hajong includes some vowel harmony and the devoicing of final consonants. Clothing Argon Traditionally womenfolk chiefly wear Pathin, a wrap- around skirt that covered the upper and lower part of the body from the bust till the calf of the leg. Women in the upper class wore a long pathin which falls down to the floor while women in the lower class wore a shorter pathin which length reaches to the ankle. The pathin is a horizontally striped, colourful, rectangular piece of cloth with alternate layers of different colours between red stripes called kan and thick horizontal borders called chapa. Pathins are woven by women at their family looms known as Bana or Tath. It is operated with hands and does not require the usage of feet. The upper part of the body of the women is covered by a Parsa or Argon. Modern Hajong women occasionally wear 'Patin' to cover the lower part of the body from waist to ankle similar to Garo and Mizo tribes. The menfolk cover their bodies with a hand woven piece of cloth called as Ningti, a loin cloth and Gamsa used to cover the lower part of the body and during winter use a scarf called kompes.

Hajong women can be easily identified by their brightly striped red dress called a Pathin. Traditionally, and in many present-day villages, women are accomplished weavers who make their own Pathin, Phula Agon, Phula Kompes, Gamsa, and their household's clothing.Hajong, B. (2002).

K., Jun, M., & Choi, J. (2016, May 01). U.S Influence Responsible for S. Korea's Nurses. Army Magazine. The education and nursing system lacked a lot of resources and information that was needed for the profession. They also lacked the means to be able to educate others in the field properly.Lucka, M. V. (1946). Korea: A Challenge to Western Nursing. The American Journal of Nursing . In 1946, the U.S military had unified the nursing education. They standardized the curriculum for Korea and helped provide instruction for the faculty in the nursing education facilities. During the Korean War both Korean and American nurses played a large role. However, after the war Korea had to focus on reestablishing and furthering the Korean nursing education. As a part of nursing education, emphasis had been placed on midwifery as well.Lucka, M. V. (1946). Korea: A Challenge to Western Nursing. The American Journal of Nursing .

The park is noted for its number of phallic statues. The collection created by Korean artists is on display in the form of \\"hanging arrangements to three-meter tall trunks of wood\\", for joy, spirituality and sexuality. A small Folk Museum titled \\"Village Folk Museum\\" has exhibits of art objects on the \\"sex iconography\\" over ages in different cultures, shamanic rituals and also the history of the Korean fishing community. Legend A tragic legend known as the \\"Legend of Auebawi and Haesindang\\" shrouds the statues of the park. According to the legend, a woman was once left by her man on a rock in the sea while he worked. The man was later unable to retrieve her because of a storm, and the woman drowned. After that, the village people were not able to catch fish. Some said that it was because of the dead woman. One day, a fisherman urinated into the water and afterward, he was able to catch fish, so it was thought that exposing the deceased virgin to male genitalia pleased her. To soothe her spirit further, the local village people made several phallic wooden carvings and held religious ceremonies on her behalf. After a while, the fish slowly returned and the villagers were able to live comfortably again. The place where the woman died was named Auebawi Rock and the building where the religious ceremony is held twice a year was named Haesindang. The ceremony is still honored today as a traditional folk event. Exhibits The location where the virgin girl died is called the Aebawi Rock and a biannual religious ceremony, a traditional folk event, also known as Haesindang, is conducted at a small building here. The seaward end of the park has a small shrine dedicated to the spirit of the virgin girl, and the park has a bronze statue about the legend. There are around 50 phallic statues exhibited in various sizes and styles; some have faces on them and are more animated in appearance and more colorful, but others are exact depictions of the human penis. Near the cliff top there is a Chinese zodiac of sculptures in an arch with each animal carved inside of life-size penises. Some of the sculptures are also in the form of park benches, drums, and there's even a moving cannon. These were created for an exhibition held at Samcheok during the former Penis Culture Festival. Middle-aged men and women throng the museum. There is also a phallic red lighthouse down on the dock. The park also houses Korea's largest aquarium theater and an arboretum.

From 1909 to 1935 he followed a career as a teacher, first at Clifton College and Rugby School, and later as headmaster of The King's School, Chester and the Liverpool Institute High School. He was a classicist, but encouraged his pupils to broaden their education by studying English literature and the fine arts. Symonds, who had a lifelong love of the countryside, retired at the age of 50, and devoted his life to the cause of national parks, and the Lake District in particular. He was one of the principal driving forces behind the legislation that introduced national parks to Britain after the Second World War. Life and career=Early life and teaching career Symonds was born in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the son of Henry Symonds (1859‚Äì1933), a barrister, and his wife Florence Annie n√©e Whitfield (1862‚Äì1941).England and Wales 1891 census, household transcription, RG12/2358/51/p. 16 His birth was registered in the first quarter of 1885 and he was baptised on 26 April 1885 at Leamington.England and Wales, FreeBMD Birth Index, 1837‚Äì1915, Volume 6D, p. 618; and England and Wales Christening Records, 1530‚Äì1906 He was educated at Rugby School and Oriel College, Oxford, where he took a first class degree in Greats (classics).\\"Symonds, Rev. Henry Herbert\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 27 April 2011 While at Oxford he came under the influence of Hastings Rashdall, who inspired him with a lifelong love of the Lake District.\\"The Rev. H. H. Symonds ‚Äì A champion of natural beauty\\", The Manchester Guardian, 29 December 1958, p. 2 After leaving Oxford he was appointed to the teaching staff of Clifton College in 1909. In 1911 he married Gwendolen Watson, with whom he had a son and two daughters. In 1912 Symonds returned to Rugby as a master, taking charge of the senior classics form (known as the \\"Upper Bench\\"), a post that he retained for ten years. The Manchester Guardian wrote of this period of his career, \\"Symonds was a teacher of the highest order. He was exact in scholarship and copious in knowledge. His love for the Hellenic civilisation was profound and contagious: he was concerned that his pupils should be as familiar with its beauty as with its grammar and its chronology. They responded so well that three of his pupils took Firsts in Greats in a single year.\\" Symonds did not take a narrow view of the teaching of classics, and encouraged his pupils to study English literature and the fine arts, and to take up cross-country walking. He frequently invited them to his house to meet distinguished figures from politics and trade unions. He was active in the local branch of the Workers' Educational Association. In the school chapel some of his sermons were thought by traditionalists to be too radical, and there was controversy when he preached a sermon considered pacifist in tone. In 1922, Symonds was appointed headmaster of The King's School, Chester. He later described his two years there as \\"somewhat storm-tossed, but educationally vital.\\" In 1924 he was appointed headmaster of the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys. Here, The Manchester Guardian wrote, \\"he found real 'elbow-room' ... He was able to spread some liberalising doctrines and disciplines through a great day school.\\" As at Rugby, he instructed the senior pupils in literature, painting, sculpture and architecture. One of his pupils later recalled: Admission to the school was strictly on intellectual ability, and many of the pupils came from families of modest means; Symonds personally subsidised many of them and helped them go on to a university education. He set up school camps in the Lake District in the Borrowdale and Duddon valleys. In 1932 Symonds was invited to join the Headmasters' Conference. This would have given the Liverpool Institute the same official status as the leading public schools, but Symonds declined the invitation, explaining, despite local controversy, that the school belonged to the City of Liverpool and did not need to seek any other status.\\"Journey into Language\\", BBC Radio 4, accessed 1 May 2011 Work for the Lake District April 1933 saw the first publication of his book, \\"Walking in the Lake District\\". In 1935, on his 50th birthday, Symonds, resigned the headmastership, retired from teaching, and dedicated the rest of his life to preserving the beauty of the Lake District and promoting national parks. He had for some years been active in this sphere; he was the founding chairman of the association that opened Britain's first youth hostels for young walkers, was editor of the journal of the National Council of Ramblers' Federations, and published a book Walking in the Lake District in 1933. From 1935 he gave all his time to the Lake District and associated causes. He joined the new organisation Friends of the Lake District, and for \\"the next twenty years was its moving spirit\\", as treasurer, later secretary, and finally chairman. For the Councils for the Preservation of Rural England and Wales he was secretary to their joint National Parks Committee. In 1948 he presided at what became known as the \\"Ogwen Demonstration\\" at which hundreds of ramblers gathered to protest against plans to introduce intrusive hydro- electric plant into Snowdonia. His first wife died in 1937; the following year he married Ruth Williams; there were no children of the second marriage. When the postwar Labour government finally introduced a parliamentary bill to enshrine national parks in British law, Symonds was a driving force in shaping the legislation. He was appointed to the planning board of the new Lake District National Park, and in 1957 he was invited to become a member of the National Parks Commission. In his later years he also served as president of the Ramblers' Association. Symonds died in 1958, aged 73, leaving his estate, which was valued at ¬£78,515 (equal to about ¬£3,460,000 in 2009 terms),Measured in terms of average earnings: see to the National Trust. It consisted chiefly of five farms in the Lake District. He left little money, having given most of what he had to the trust and other conservation bodies during his lifetime.\\"Lake District Land for National Trust\\", The Times, 20 April 1959, p. 7 NotesReferences *Bridge, Norman (1992).

It is located since 1970 in Vaulx-en-Velin, in the suburbs of Lyon, facing the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Architecture de Lyon, the school of architecture of Lyon. Presentation Founded in 1954 in Paris (boulevard Saint-Germain, in the actual buildings of the ESTP), the ENTPE moved in 1970 in the Lyon area, where it settled in Vaulx-en-Velin, in a building built by the architect Jacques Perrin-Fayolle. It shares its campus with the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'architecture de Lyon, the School of Architecture of Lyon. The main vocation of the ENTPE is to train the civil engineers who will be the main managers of the Ministry, even though nowadays more and more of its students work for private companies. The school has long been a full part of the Ministry of Infrastructure but is now administratively speaking a national public establishment of an administrative character, outside university perimeter. Admission Students can be civil servants or not: * The civil servants engineering students are paid starting on their first year of school but then sign an engagement to work for the French State for 8 years starting at the end of their scholarship. The netto salary of one of these is around ‚Ç¨1300 for the students accepted through the external exam. * The non-civil servants engineering students are simply called \\"civilians\\". They don't get paid during school and work mainly for the private sector after, but sometimes can integrate para-public companies or pass the Territorial Engineer exam to work for non-etatic entities. This \\"civilian\\" profile was created in 1987 but will probably grow stronger with time, due to the actual state policies. External exams Admission to the ENTPE is made through a very selective entrance examination, and requires a minimum of two years of preparation after high school in classes pr√©paratoires. Internal exams Also exists an exam exclusively made for civil servants having served a minimum of four years as higher technicians. Each year, 10 to 15 civil servants are chosen that way Recruitment after another degree A direct admission in second year (Master I equivalent) is possible, for French students or students with citizenship from the European union. It is necessary to already withhold a Master I diploma cum laude in Civil Engineering, Mathematics, Mechanics or Physics. Foreign students Foreign students (outside EU) have access through the \\"classical\\" external way (they can't be French civil servant though) or can access with special conditions through agreements with foreign schools.  Curriculum =Initial Curriculum The ENTPE trains engineers in 3 years in all the fields of civil engineering, town and country planning and sustainable development. The teaching is the same, regardless of the admission way. The training goes the following way : *First year : **Common courses **Worksman internship of 4 weeks *Second year : **Common courses **Choice of a specialization among the 6 fields the School has to offer : ***Civil Engineering (3 sub-fields: bridges & tunnels, geotechnics, roads) ***Buildings ***Town planning ***Transportation planning ***Transportation management ***Environment (3 sub-fields: rivers & coastline, pollution management, risks prevention) **5 months internship as an engineer assistant *Third year : **Fewer common courses **Almost full-time courses for the chosen specialization **Masters thesis or internship as engineer for a duration of 6 months Complementary courses The ENTPE also proposes a large panel of complementary courses, mainly enabling students to obtain a second degree. It is for instance possible for students to obtain degrees from the following schools: * \\"Double\\" curriculum as engineer & architect with an architecture degree from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'architecture de Lyon, common course with students from the INSA de Lyon and the √©cole Centrale de Lyon) *\\"Double\\" curriculum as engineer & geologist with an engineering diploma in geology from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de g√©ologie of Nancy *Others... Doctoral school The ENTPE is also entitled to deliver PhDs inside one of the 6 laboratories it shelters. Up to 20 PhDs are delivered each year. Partnerships=French partnerships The School is member of the following: * Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea * Conf√©rence des grandes √©coles * Concours commun TPE/EIVP * PRES Universit√© de Lyon: P√¥le de recherche et d'enseignement sup√©rieur International partnerships The School also enables students to attend classes and obtain degrees from foreign universities, through many partnerships: * New York University ‚Äì United States (Master of Science ‚Äì 9 months) * University College Cork ‚Äì Ireland (Master of Engineering ‚Äì Environment ‚Äì 18 months) * University of Westminster in London ‚Äì UK (Master of Science ‚Äì 12 months) * University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) in Manchester ‚Äì UK (Master of Science ‚Äì 12 months) * Universit√© de Sherbrooke ‚Äì Canada (Ma√Ætrise ‚Äì 18 months) * Universit√© Laval de Qu√©bec ‚Äì Canada (Ma√Ætrise ‚Äì 18 months) * √âcole Hassania des Travaux Publics (EHTP) ‚Äì Royaume du Maroc * Universit√© autonome de Madrid ‚Äì Espagne * Institut universitaire d'architecture de Venise ‚Äì Italy * University of California Berkeley ‚Äì United States (Master of Science and Mechanical Engineering) Research Along with teaching, the ENTPE also deploys a strong activity in research. There are actually 6 different laboratories in the school, each one specialized in one the fields of study evoked before. Its staff sums up to over 200 persons. 4 of its 6 laboratories are part of the CNRS. Openings As its name goes, the School trains in the fields of civil engineering (\\"Travaux Publics\\"), but also those mentioned before: Building, City Planning, Environment, Transportation, and to sum it up, all the fields of engineering linked to sustainable development. Non- civil servant students (\\"civilians\\") After School, they are mainly hired by big civil engineering companies, or engineering cabinets, such as Egis, Eiffage, Vinci, Arcadis, Bouygues, etc. Civil servants There are different possibilities: * They can keep on obtaining a PhD either at one of the laboratories of the School, or one of the research labs of the Ministry. * They can be selected to obtain another degree, through a \\"fourth year\\", which will either be another Master II equivalent, or a Mast√®re Sp√©cialis√©. This mainly concerns the technical areas where the employing ministry needs specific expertise as the civil aviation or the maritime safety. * Those attending a double diploma as engineer & architect have to attend architecture school for another 2 years minimum * Finally, most students enter the Ministry, as technical management staff. * Still, it is possible for civil servants to go work for a private company, but then they will have to break the contract they have signed with the State, and therefore will have to refund all the money involved by the State in their scholarship (pays and tuitions fees), which sums up to around ‚Ç¨90000. These amounts are usually paid by the private company. Student life=Life on Campus It was established in Vaulx-en-Velin on a common campus with the school of architecture of Lyon. Numerous sports infrastructures exist, among which can be mentioned a 25 meters and 4 meters deep swimming pool, a dojo, a fitness room, 4 tennis courts. There is naturally also a cafeteria, a students' bar (Grimbergen, 1664) with its patio, a music room. Thanks to an agreement with the local HLM office, students are housed in cheap and comfortable apartments near the school. Community Life Like many other schools, the ENTPE focuses a lot on community life through different sport activities: *indoor sports: volley, basketball, indoor-football, badminton, etc. *outdoor sports : football, rugby, sailing, rowing, golf, etc. *water sports : diving, water polo, etc. *mountain sports : hiking, skiing, etc. *dance, fitness. *etc. But also on less physical activities: * Music * Annual School Gala preparation * The Rencontre Th√©atrales de Lyon (Reuteuleu), an international festival of student theater * Oenology * Cheese sampling * Poker * etc.  See also = Other Civil Engineering Schools  * √âcole sp√©ciale des travaux publics * √âcole des ing√©nieurs de la ville de Paris * Institut national des sciences appliqu√©es de Lyon * √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es * Centre des √©tudes sup√©rieures industrielles External links * The official website * Forum about the school * Official website for the students association (Bureau des √©l√®ves) * Alumni website * Architecture School of Lyon Category:Universities and colleges in Lyon Category:Engineering universities and colleges in France Category:University of Lyon Category:Grandes √©coles ","title":"√âcole nationale des travaux publics de l'√âtat"},{"id":"31645086","text":"Wikibu.ch is a free software tool to assess the reliability of German Wikipedia articles.Wikibu website (in German)Zeitgeschichte- Medien- Historische Bildung edited by Bettina Alavi, Marko Demantowsky Gerhard Paul 2010 page 287 It was released by the University of Teacher Education Bern for use in schools to improve information literacy.Nando St√∂cklin: Glaubw√ºrdigkeit von Wikipedia-Inhalten: Bibliotheken sind gefragt.
