Biography He was born at a plantation in Concordia Parish, Louisiana, the son of Thomas Prince Farrar (his parents Martha Farrar and Thomas.) After home schooling during which he was tutored in Greek and Latin, he attended college at the Baton Rouge Collegiate Institute, then earned his masters from the University of Virginia. He studied law at the University of Louisiana and was admitted to the bar in 1872. In 1874 he was married to Lucinda Davis Stamps, the grand niece of Jefferson Davis, and they had seven children. He was a member of the Louisiana state militia up until 1884, attaining the rank of Colonel. In 1878-80 he was assistant corporation counsel of the city of New Orleans. He became corporate counsel for the city in 1880. Two years later he was named to the administrative board of the University of Louisiana. In 1882 he became a member of the trustees of the funds that were used to found Tulane University. In 1884 he partnered with Ernest Benjamin Kruttschiit to form a law firm. They were later joined by Senator B. F. Jonas. Farrar became the head of the bar in Louisiana, and had a strong influence throughout the South. He was president of the Louisian Tax Commission, 1906‚Äì1908. From 1910 to 1911 he was president of the American Bar Association. A major accomplishment during his career as a corporate lawyer was the consolidation of the street railways of New Orleans. This project required him to reconcile many differing groups and goals which some thought irreconcilable. Political activism His work as corporate counsel for New Orleans demonstrated to him the need for municipal reform in the city. He became active in various political groups. He was for years chairman of the Executive Committee of One Hundred to reform the municipal government of New Orleans. He led the Anti-Lottery League's campaign which defeated the proposition to extend the charter of the Louisiana Lottery. He was chairman of the Committee of Fifty, formed in 1891 to investigate the existence of organized crime in New Orleans. An outspoken white supremacist, Farrar was also one of the organizers of the lynching of eleven Italians which occurred that year. He was a founder and a prime mover of a campaign to modernize the sewer and water systems of New Orleans. The success of this drive resulted in much improved health statistics for the city. Although previously a loyal Democrat, in 1896 he declined to endorse the Democratic Party's nomination of William Jennings Bryan and bimetallist platform. He helped organize a separate ‚Äúgold‚Äù convention of Democrats. In 1907, he wrote a notable letter to President Theodore Roosevelt invoking the ‚Äúpost roads‚Äù clause of the Constitution of the United States in support of federal involvement in road improvement.

It is one of the most notable holy monuments in Bohemian Switzerland.  Description  The unique chapel was hollowed entirely out of a free-standing block of sandstone that resembles a loaf of bread. From the outside only a small cross and the two windows are visible. Inside, only the moisture percolating through from above indicates that the chapel was hewn out of solid rock. Together with the surrounding Upper Lusatian half-timbered houses the chaple forms a striking ensemble of the vernacular architecture of North Bohemia. Immediately in front are the old schoolhouse of Schemmel, which is striking on account of its size and the small bell tower on the roof.  History  The chapel was first mentioned in directory of the crosses and statues of the diocese of Windisch Kamnitz in 1835: A non public chapel, hewn out of the rock, inside a painting of Saint Ignatius. It stands on farming land. Its patron lives in Kaltenbach and no-one from the parish will take on the advowson, because it is made of stone, damp and everything in it is likely to decay soon. Astonishingly, in spite of that, the chapel has survived to the present day. Even following the expulsion of the German folk after the Second World War, there were people amongst the new inhabitants of the village who looked after the chapel and protected it from threatened abandonment and destruction. Today the chapel is under the care of the municipal office of Jet≈ôichovice (Dittersbach), to which the V≈°emily belongs today.

Etymology The townland name is an anglicisation of the Gaelic placename \\"D√∫n Mhic √çomhair\\" which means 'The Fort of √çomhair‚Äôs Son'. √çomhair, who lived about 850 A.D., was Lord of Tullyhaw and the son of Cosgrach mac D√∫nghal. √çomhair‚Äôs son was Ruarc, after whom the townland is named, who lived about 880 A.D and was also Lord of Tullyhaw and an ancestor of the McGovern clan. Ruarc‚Äôs name is also preserved in the adjoining townland of Aghatirourke which is an anglicisation of 'Achadh-tigh-Ruairc' which means \\"The Field of Ruarc‚Äôs House\\". These townland names, along with Moneensauran, supply important evidence that the McGovern clan originally came from Glangevlin and only later spread out to other parts of Tullyhaw such as Ballymagauran and Blacklion. The earliest surviving mention of the townland name is 'Dunnemakevir', from a list of Co. Cavan townlands printed in 1790. Geography Dunmakeever is bounded on the north by Aghatirourke, Gortmaconnell, Legnabrocky, Aghnahoo, Tromogagh and Legg townlands, on the east by Alteen, Bursan and Commas (Kinawley) townlands, on the south by Tonanilt, Tullyminister and Corracleigh townlands and on the west by Tullycrafton, Ardvagh and Tullynacross (Glangevlin) townlands. Its chief geographical features are Cuilcagh Mountain reaching an altitude of 2,200 feet, Dunmakeever Lough, Dunmakeever Lough North, the Owenmore River (County Cavan) and several waterfalls. Dunmakeever is traversed by the R200 road from Ballinamore to Glangevlin and some minor lanes. The townland covers an area of 1,233 statute acres. History In the 1609 Plantation of Ulster, Dunmakeever formed part of lands which were granted to John Sandford of Castle Doe, Co. Donegal by letters patent dated 7 July 1613 (Pat. 11 James I ‚Äì LXXI ‚Äì 38, 'Glangewley' & 'Quilkagh'). It was later sold by Sandford to his wife's uncle Sir Toby Caulfield, Master of the Ordnance and Caulfield had the sale confirmed by letters patent of 12 July 1620 (Pat. 19 James I. XI. 45). In the 1821 census of Ireland, there are ten families listed in the townland and it states- Doonmakeever contains 100 acres of green pasture & 500 acres of BlackRock mountain. Census of Ireland 1821 The 1825 Tithe Applotment Books spell the name as Doonmaquiver. In 1841 the population of the townland was 93, being 49 males and 41 females. There were thirteen houses in the townland and all were inhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 96, being 51 males and 45 females. There were sixteen houses in the townland and all were inhabited. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists fourteen occupiers in the townland.

Described in the 'Archaeological Inventory of County Cavan' (Site No. 123), Patrick O‚ÄôDonovan, 1995, as- An almost circular cairn (diam. c. 16m; H 3.2m). The NE half of the site is enclosed by the remains of a substantial drystone wall. Situated on the summit of Cuilcagh Mountain on the border between counties Cavan and Fermanagh. The site was known as 'Lacht a mhac a whoole' commemorating McEnhill, chief of a clan driven out of Tyrone by the O'Neills. According to tradition the cairn was used as an inauguration site by the Maguires. In the late forties of this century workers tossed some stones and built a triangulation station on top of the monument (Glangevlin Guild ICA 1983, 42). There are three hut sites a short distance to SE (CV006-003001-, CV006-003002-, CV006-003003-). The website Glangevlin.com states- On the top of Cuilcagh are two monuments about three miles apart, one of which is only a small one called Lacht an Phelim from Phelim O'Dolan who was an ancient proprietor of Gleann Gaibhle. It was erected some centuries ago. The O'Dolans were a wealthy family and owned the townland of Gub. The larger monument was known as Lacht a mhac a' Whoole from a 'mac a' Whoole' [McEnhill in English) the head of a clan who were driven out of Tyrone by the O'Neills centuries ago and fled to the mountains with a party of followers and stayed there until they were betrayed. This monument resembles a fort surrounded by a large wall of dry stone. Near this erection bee-hived shaped huts can be seen. These were probably built by the Tyrone clan. Some say that writers used them and that one night a terrible storm of thunder and lightning broke out and that those writers fled and never returned. In the late forties of this present century workers tossed some stones and built a triangulation station by night on the top of the monument. A date, 11 June 1949, is quite visible. Other stations were built at the same time all over Ireland and were used to map the country. In the fifties other work was carried out by night. Those monuments form part of the border between Cavan and Fermanagh but it is easier to reach them from the Cavan side. Dean Henry climbed in 1739 from this side. Many schools and colleges organise bus tours to the large monument as it is a tourist attraction. St. Patrick is said to have prayed at the Monument. Cuilcagh - Summit cairn & trig point (geograph 3762624) # Carty‚Äôs Bridge over the Owenmore river, built c. 1800. The Buildings of Ireland website describes it as- Single-arch stone road bridge, built c.1800, spanning Owenmore River. Segmental arch resting on squared ashlar abutments with squared rubble-stone soffit. Arch ring of regular ashlar voussoirs, with rubble-stone spandrels. Rubble-stone parallel wing walls and parapets of even length. Low parapets with Scotch coping. Appraisal- An elegant single arch bridge of robust construction, that is an excellent example of early nineteenth century civil engineering. The road network was considerably expanded in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, and this bridge is a reminder of the materials, technology, and skills that were used for engineering projects at the time. According to the website www.glangevlin.com- it derives its name from a widow woman, Nellie Carthy, who had two sons. She owned a sheebeen and sold \\"poteen\\". She was reported to the revenue authorities in Enniskillen. The officers arrived on a Church Holiday. The congregation left the church before Mass was ended and sent word to Nellie that the officers were on the way. The people ran to her rescue and succeeded in hiding some of the \\"home brew\\". Some people got across the river Tamhnaigh while others followed pursued by the officers who were challenged and shots were fired. Two men, Doyle and McGovern were killed. Two large upright stones mark the spots where the men fell in the field, bordering the present Doonmakeever road and adjacent to the old Glan road. The D√∫chas website states- In the townland of Doonmakiever in the parish of Glangevlin, Co. Cavan on the first road (now old and disused) there are two upright stones close to each other. These mark the place where two men fell when they were shot down by what was then called revenue officers. This shooting took place on Christmas day over a century ago. There was a Sheeven close to Cartys bridge in which a man named Carty illegally sold drink. A local man in the pay of the Government reported Carty, and on Christmas day in that year the aforesaid officer came. They people were coming from Mass, and a crowd followed the revenue officers, and were pressing close on them; they suddenly turned round and fired on the mob and two men fell mortally wounded on the spot where the stones now stand.

It is especially common in the region running from Silesia through Upper Lusatia and North Bohemia and into Saxon Switzerland, as well as East Thuringia.  Characteristics  The Upper Lusatian house is defined by the constructional separation of its living area from the roof, or its living area from the upper story and roof. The main characteristic of the normal type is \\"a wooden support system, which runs around the living area of the house made of logs or boards, which has the job of freeing the frame of the living area from the weight of the roof (in single-storey houses) or the roof and upper storey (in two-storey houses).\\"Delitz 1987, p. 12 Upper Lusatian houses are transversely divided Middle German houses or Ernh√§user. The hallway runs transversely across the house and separates the ground floor into living and working areas. The living area or Blockstube is usually located at the eastern or southern gable end in order to protect it from damp. The working area, of solid construction (usually rubble stone) is located opposite the Blockstube. This is where the animal stalls or stables, store rooms and barn are housed. A building in which the solid section is replaced by another Blockstube is known as a Doppelstubenhaus (\\"double living area house\\"). Above the Blockstube (Handweberstube) the upper storey or roof rests on wooden posts that are stabilised by triangulation with jetty brackets (Knagge) or braces (Kopfverbund). It is thus independent of the carrying elements below it and may be freely worked on. The upper storey is usually of timber framed construction. By contrast, especially in North Bohemia, the upper storey is made of log cabin construction.  Gallery  File:Umgebindehaus Ebersbach LC0001.jpgUmgebindehaus in Ebersbach/Sa.

Aphrophora alni is a polyphagous species, meaning it feeds on several kind of plants. The adults primarily feed on deciduous trees, while larvae prefer herbaceous plants (dicotyledonous).Commanster To lay eggs, the females migrate to the herb layers. The eggs overwinter and hatch the larvae in the following spring. The larvae live in stems and leaves of herbaceous plants inside the typical foam nest, that protects them against enemies and provide necessary moisture and temperature for their development.

She ran the first leg of \\"The Royal Route\\" to Ardrishaig for fifty eight summers. History Columba was built by J & G Thomson of Clydebank, for David Hutcheson & Co. (later David MacBrayne Ltd). Commissioned for the first stage of the \\"Royal Route\\" to Loch Fyne, she was the flagship of the MacBrayne fleet from 1879 to 1935 and is often considered the finest Clyde steamer of all time. She brought new elegance and comfort to Scottish travel, and typified the mid-Victorian tourist steamer at its best. Columba and her sister ship were well maintained and kept their lustre to the end. Both were retired and broken up side by side at shipbreakers, Arnott & Young at Dalmuir in March 1936. Layout Columba was modelled on Hutcheson's , which she was destined to replace. She had a curved bow and two funnels and was fitted out to a high standard. There were a barber's shop and a post office on board. When Columba was re boilered in 1900, her four navy boilers were replaced by two haystack boilers. The reduction in weight meant that she floated five inches higher in the water. At the same time, a smoking room was erected on the promenade deck immediately abaft the after funnel. Service All of Columbas distinguished career was on the first leg of \\"The Royal Route\\" from Glasgow to Ardrishaig, calling at Rothesay and the Kyles of Bute. The route, so named after Queen Victoria sailed from the Clyde in 1847, was used by the cream of Victorian and Edwardian society to reach estates in the Highlands. Columba visited Ardrishaig over 5600 times in her 58-year career. Other vessels took the continuation of the Royal Route through the Crinan Canal to Oban, Fort William and Inverness (through the Caledonian Canal). Columba was replaced by MacBrayne's turbine steamer Saint Columba (formerly Queen Alexandra).

Like cobaltocene, decamethylcobaltocene has a 19 electron count in its valence shell and is paramagnetic. It is used as a one-electron reducing agent. Relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple, the redox potential for the [CoCp*2]+/0 couple is -1.94 V compared to the [CoCp2]+/0 couple of -1.33 V (in dichloromethane).

The fertile Alishang valley drained by the Alishang River, which is described as \\"contracted\\", has an abundance of mounds and caves. Is surrounded by Badrow hills. Alladad Khan castle is located close to the village. The Alishang River valley has a number of villages on the way from Jalalabad, such as Kargai, Tajak, Tigadee and Safees along its river course, which in some reaches is very narrow and can be forded by dismounting from the horse's back. Geography Alishang village is on the banks of Alishang River, which is also called the Nadjil River. It rises in the mountains of Nadjil on the southern slopes of Hindukush mountains and after traversing 90 miles joins the Alinghar River in Alishang village. The valley and the river are both named as Alishang. Similarly, Alinghar River is also known as the Kow, which rises in the Hindukush mountains joins the Alishang River in Alishang. The Rhododendron Afghanicum was found in the Laghman Valley, northeast of Kabul. ;Natural disasters Alishang district (estimated population 139,000) as a whole under the Laghman Province is prone to natural disasters due to floods, snow and drought. During 2003‚Äì2004, the flood damage in the district was to agricultural land and crops, due to snow to animal life and also by drought. History The earliest history is traced to the Mughal Emperor Babur. In the 1520s, Babur, while camping in Alishang, had hunted wildlife in the mountains of the Alishang valley before he returned to India. The place finds mention in Babur's writings and the people inhabiting the village are stated to be cantankerous and are given an epithet in the local language. In the 1840s, the settlement was described as a \\"small walled-in town, of about four hundred houses, but has nothing remarkable in its appearance.\\" This valley was in 1883 the westward limit of Kafiristan according to William Watts McNair.William Watts McNair A Visit to Kafiristan, lecture to the Royal Geographical Society, december 1883. In the war against the Soviets, Mujahideen forces who had taken shelter in the village were attacked. After initial set back and death of several soldiers and the local Mujahideen leader of Alishang, Mujahideen forces managed to defend the village. Soviets withdrew under fierce fighting in which the Mujahideen had superior firepower; both sides suffered many casualties. The local villagers provided help in many respects to the Mujahideen soldiers. In August 1981, the Mujahideen controlled the district centre of Alishang. In March 2011, the Mujahideen were reported to have attacked a US camp in the area. In 2006, a new micro-hydro electrical power plant opened in Alishang, built at a cost of US$32,000 by the Methar Lam Provincial Reconstruction Team. The plant provides power to some 300 homes in the area.

An influence on prog rock and jazz rock, he is known primarily as an organist and pianist, and also plays vibraphone. Biography He was born Donald John Walsh in West Ham, London, and when young was adopted by the Shinn family in Southampton, Hampshire, where he grew up.Bruno Ceriotti and Martin Ruddock, \\"Departures and Return Trips\\", Shindig!, no.99, January 2020, pp.46-49 He learned piano as a child, before joining the military and playing clarinet in an Army band. After returning to Southampton, he bought a Bird Duplex organ and joined local band The Lonely Ones, becoming known for his habit of playing the organ pedals with bare feet. After the band renamed themselves The Soul Agents, they recorded three singles for Pye Records, produced by Tony Hatch. Other band members were Johnny Keeping (vocals), Tony Good (guitar), Jim Sach (bass), and Roger Pope (drums). In 1964‚Äì65, the band were the regular backing group for singer Rod Stewart. After Keeping and Sach left, The Soul Agents continued as a trio of Shinn, Good and Pope, with Shinn upgrading to a Hammond organ. Shinn was hospitalised with tuberculosis for several months in 1965, but after his recovery formed a new version of The Soul Agents with Pope, Dave Glover (bass) and Pete Hunt (vocals). Their final single, \\"A-Minor Explosion\\" / \\"Pits of Darkness\\", credited to Don Shinn & The Soul Agents, was released on the Polydor label in 1966. Like the band's other releases, this was not a commercial success, but both sides are now seen as \\"a testament to his credentials as a pioneer of prog.... combining neo-classical flourishes with jazz licks and R&B; raunch...\\". Shinn was particularly influential on Keith Emerson, who adopted some of Shinn's onstage performance techniques such as jamming a screwdriver into the keyboard. Shinn also recorded with another Southampton band, The MeddyEvils. The Soul Agents disbanded, and Shinn formed a new group, simply called Shinn, in early 1967, with Eddie Lamb (vocals), Paul Newton (bass - later of Uriah Heep), and Brian Davison (drums - later of The Nice). However, the band split up after a few months, and Shinn joined The Echoes, backing Dusty Springfield. In late 1967, record producer Denis Preston invited Shinn to record a solo album. The instrumental album, initially titled Don Shinn... Takes a Trip but then retitled Temples With Prophets for release in the UK, was eventually issued by Columbia in early 1969. Shinn's second album, Departures was released later in 1969. Shinn also worked as a session musician, playing organ, electric piano and harpsichord on James Taylor's debut album. In 1969, Shinn left The Echoes and co-founded the band Dada, with guitarist and arranger Pete Gage, and singers Elkie Brooks and Paul Korda. Shinn wrote or co-wrote several of the tracks on their 1970 album, and, after they added singer Robert Palmer, Shinn toured the US with the band. After returning to the UK, Shinn left the band as it transformed itself into Vinegar Joe. He also worked with Kiki Dee, Engelbert Humperdinck, Stan Tracey, Persian vocalist Parvaneh Farid, and Renaissance. In the early 1970s, Shinn joined former Soul Agents bandmate Pete Hunt in the jazz rock band Iguana, but in 1974 left the British music business and moved to Norway. Shinn lived in Norway until the mid-1990s, and played in many local bands and with visiting musicians. He returned to Southampton in 1995, and continued to play with local bands as well as playing church organs. His Columbia albums have been reissued on CD.

O'Donnell (February 6, 1922 ‚Äì September 4, 2004) was a Wisconsin politician and the second Milwaukee County Executive, serving from 1976 to 1988. Prior to serving as county executive, O'Donnell was the chairman of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors from 1975 to 1976.  Early career  O'Donnell was raised on Milwaukee's near west side, where his father worked as a plumber. O'Donnell attended Lincoln High School but dropped out at age 17 to seek employment, as his family's income was severely affected by the Great Depression. He served in the United States Army during World War II and was employed as a factory and brewery worker in Milwaukee following his discharge. In 1948, O'Donnell was elected to the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors. A political liberal and supporter of City of Milwaukee interests on the board, O'Donnell introduced legislation in 1958 establishing the office of Milwaukee County Executive. In 1964, County Executive John Doyne appointed O'Donnell as chairman of the Milwaukee County Welfare Board; in May 1975, O'Donnell's fellow county supervisors elected him as county board chairman. A transit advocate who commuted to work by bus, O'Donnell oversaw Milwaukee County's acquisition of the privately run local bus system in 1975. Upon Doyne's retirement in 1976, O'Donnell ran to replace him as county executive. He emerged first in the February 1976 primary and defeated Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann in the April general election.  Tenure as County Executive  O'Donnell characterized his political persona as that of a \\"good solid anchor\\". As county executive, he centralized county administration, creating cabinet positions by removing administrators' civil service protections and abolishing independent agencies such as the Welfare Board and the Milwaukee County Park Commission. O'Donnell expanded the county's administrative staff, was the first county executive to appoint a chief of staff, and sought to reduce the county's property tax levy. Generally supportive of welfare programs, he directly supervised county services for the elderly and disabled and worked to reduce number of individuals on county welfare rolls. Despite his long tenure as a county supervisor, O'Donnell clashed at times with the board and his successor as chairman, F. Thomas Ament. In 1980, after Ament supported O'Donnell's general election challenger, O'Donnell backed another supervisor's unsuccessful bid to unseat Ament from the board chairmanship.  Schulz firing and 1988 reelection campaign  In 1984, O'Donnell appointed Chicago budget official Dave Schulz, a Milwaukee native, as Milwaukee County budget director. In 1985, O'Donnell appointed Schulz as director of the Milwaukee County Parks Department; the charismatic Schulz gained notoriety for his promotion of the park system. In 1987, Schulz violated O'Donnell's prohibition on political endorsements by county administrators, publicly supporting reformist candidate John O. Norquist for Mayor of Milwaukee. O'Donnell dismissed Schulz, who promptly filed to run for county executive in 1988. Schulz waged a vigorous campaign and defeated O'Donnell in the April 1988 general election. Following his defeat, O'Donnell lived in retirement until his death on September 4, 2004, at age 82.Former Milwaukee County Executive dies  Notes  Category:Politicians from Milwaukee Category:Military personnel from Wisconsin Category:County supervisors in Wisconsin Category:Milwaukee County Executives Category:1922 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"William O'Donnell (Wisconsin politician)"},{"id":"31622820","text":"Wu Qiuhua (born 21 June 1959) is a Chinese fencer.

The 2009 energy efficiency and renewable energy research investment was a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and it increased federal funds in renewable energy. The package included $50 billion in spending and $20 billion in tax provisions. The research within the investment also increased; as a result $8.8 billion went into renewable energy research. The investment also included a boost for \\"green buildings\\". Federal buildings received $4.5 billion in renovations; public housing was also granted $4 billion in renovations. An additional $250 million was made out to energy-efficient affordable housing, in part by installing insulation. Environment America, an organization of state-based, environmental advocacy organizations, reviewed the final bill and stated there was $32.80 billion in funding for clean energy projects, $26.86 billion for energy efficiency initiatives and $18.95 billion for green transportation, totaling $78.61 billion just for \\"green\\" projects. Background During his 2008 presidential campaign President Barack Obama stated to help and invest federal money into the green energy industry in the United States. President Obama stated that the plan would put 460,000 Americans to work on renewable energy projects and double the amount of renewable energy produced over the next three years. The plan provided funds to 2 million homes by improving things such as insulation problems. The government pledged to use federal funds to improve the efficiency of 75 percent of federal buildings. New green job market President Obama made a plan that put 460,000 Americans to work on energy projects and doubled the amount of alternative energy produced over the next three years. The number of green energy jobs increased. In the short term, the plan would provide funds to improve 2 million homes by improving things such as insulation and leaky windows. The government also hired additional workers to improve the efficiency of 75 percent of federal buildings. $500 million was distributed as grants for training workers in their respected jobs markets. That sum includes $50 million for communities battered by job losses and restructuring the auto industry after the financial crisis of 2008. The energy, education and labor departments also started a partnership to help link the unemployed with jobs, training and education opportunities together. Capital requirements The United States government‚Äôs need to have the capital market back up their initiatives was studied by University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Robert Pollin and was written in Nation magazine in February 2009. Bank, as he research stated, would be required to devote a percentage of loan portfolios to green investments in the next decade, he wrote, while larger tax credits could be provided to homes and businesses for installation of solar energy and other renewable energy. Funds from a cap-and-trade emissions program or a carbon tax could also be recycled back. Improvements to renewable energy programs=Wind energy Wind farm developers had extended tax credits for every kilowatt hour of electricity they produce. Until now, the credit expired every year and investors were hesitant to put money into projects that could lose their favored tax status in a matter of months. The wind industry called for many of the swaps to the tax credits that the stimulus bill includes. That credit was extended for up to three years. The United States wind industry in 2008 installed about 42% of all the new electric generating space added that year and created 35,000 jobs, in construction and manufacturing. The renewable energy measures in the stimulus bill proposed to aid and sustain green energy as well as encourage additional clean energy job creation. Solar energy Solar energy developers were also included in the bill. The bill backed proposed statements in the stimulus package that would change the current system of tax credits for investing in the alternative energy project. Since the recession has begun to effect the economy, many banks didn't have enough revenue and tax bills and weren't very interested in partnering to get tax credit. So the money to invest in alternative energy decreased significantly. In the stimulus package it shifted federal money directly to developers, in addition to keeping the original tax breaks for the renewable energy programs in America. Green buildings Green building developers have to now get permits and rights-of-way to build lines across private property. The stimulus package doesn't address one big obstacle for green energy building, the cheap cost of burning coal. To make electricity renewable energy advocates are trying to persuade Congress to put a carbon price on carbon-heavy fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs.

However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year.

Paul was the first Indian-born National General Secretary of the National Council of YMCAs of India. A devout Christian himself, he explored the relationship between Christianity and national identity. He held positions such as President of the Governing Council of the United Theological College, Bangalore, General Secretary of the National Missionary Society (India), and Chairman of the National Christian Council of India. Paul's lasting legacy was rural reconstruction, which he initiated through the YMCA in India. He was an ardent follower of Mahatma Gandhi, who praised K.T. Paul for his nationalism.  Biography = Early life  Kanakarayan Tiruselvam Paul was born on 24 March 1876 in a Christian family at Salem, Madras Presidency, India. After matriculation and Intermediates studies he joined Madras Christian College in 1892, to earn his bachelor's degree. Though after studies he got a job in the Government secretariat, he resigned from it after his marriage. He then joined the Coimbatore London Mission High School as a teacher, and later became the Headmaster of the Punganur Arcot Mission High School. In 1902 he joined the Teacher's College at Saidepet, and the following year he made a comeback to his alma-mater, Madras Christian College, as a tutor in the Department of History.  Christian leader  Paul's contributions to the church in India may be seen from his work at the National Missionary Society (NMS). In 1905 he helped Vedanayakam Samuel Azariah to establish the National Missionary Society at Serampore and became its Honorary Treasurer; the following year he became its Organising Secretary; and from 1909 to 1914 its general secretary. In this capacity he became aware of the need for unity in Christian witness and social activity. As general secretary he visited churches, conducted personal interviews and organised branch meetings all over India. in north India he initiated a civic body called 'Premsabha‚Äô (meaning 'Council of Love' in Hindi), which did social and religious work among poor Christians of the depressed classes. His contacts with Christian missionaries of other denominations also led Paul to think about the need of unity among Christians, and to take part in the formation of the South Indian United Church. Paul worked for the transformation of the National Missionary Council of India into National Christian Council of India, in which the Indian churches as well as missions from overseas were members. He became the first Chairman of the National Christian Council of India. Paul also showed much interest in theological education. At the time of his death he was the President of the Governing Council of the United Theological College, Bangalore. He was also the convener of the SIUC committee on theological education. Paul became the president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians in 1923 and represented the Indian Christian community at the London Round Table Conferences in 1930‚Äì1932 along with Surendra Kumar Datta.  Indian Nationalism and Christian Leaders  The massacre of innocent Indians by General Dyer at the Jallianwalla Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1918 had fanned the fire of anti-British feeling all over India. Mahatma Gandhi, launching his first attack on British rule using the weapon of Satyagraha, gave a call for Non Cooperation Movement in 1920. Indian Christians could not sit on the fence, and had to reveal where their sympathies lay. The leaders S. K. Datta and K. T. Paul published an article in the 'Young Men of India' in July 1920 protesting against the insensitive behaviour of the British in the Punjab. Though the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh had shocked Indian Christians, Paul had not lost his belief that India could build its future through organic links with Western Christianity and British contact. However, his hopes of transformation of the Indian polity in cooperation with the British rule strengthened by diarchy turned into dismay in 1918. The history of India since the second half of the 19th century had been distinguished by a national movement for political independence. In its initial stages Indian Christians had seldom participated, and during the first Non-cooperation Movement of Gandhi [1920‚Äì23], there was hardly any Christian participation. But in the latter phases of the struggle an increasing number of Christians began to identify with the national movement, and the maintenance of a secular state ‚Äì especially from among the Reformed Churches: H.C. Mukherjee, Raja Sir Maharaj Singh, K.T. Paul, S.K. Datta and V.S. Azariah and V.Santiago are examples. Between 1900 and 1930 K.T. Paul, S.K. Datta, V.Santiago and V.S. Azariah formed a trio who instilled feelings of responsible nationalism in the Christian community ‚Äì despite opposition from some western missionaries as well as some Indian Christians. In the 1930s and 40s Christians were mainly on the side of the Indian National Congress in its struggle for independence. Several Christian organisations such as Christian Patriot Group of Madras, and Indian Christian Association, were organised to express Christian views on political matters.  K.T. Paul as the conscience of Indian Christians  Paul grew to adulthood at a time when the Indian National Congress was voicing the growing demand of educated Indians for representative Government. Paul was committed to political nationalism, seeing in it also a self-awakening of India which would transform the totality of India's traditional life. Gandhi in his speech at the second session of the Round Table Conference in London ( 7 to 11 September December 1931) said of K.T. Paul, ‚ÄúI miss as I have no doubt all of you miss, the presence in our midst of K.T. Paul. Although, I do not know, but so far as I know, though he never officially belonged to the Congress, he was a nationalist to the full.‚Äù As the secretary of the National Missionary Society, and later as the National General Secretary of the YMCA, Paul helped to prevent the Christian community from becoming a 'communal' group. He saw a 'designed place of necessity' for nationalism in the purpose of God for mankind. Paul as a nationalist recommended indigenization of even the structure of the Indian Church. He was opposed to the Western type of church structure in India, especially episcopacy. He argued that episcopacy was a product of the West, that it was foreign to the genius of India, that the prophet and not the priest would suffice for the religious life of India, that if the united church in South India fell into the clutches of episcopacy it would be fettered perpetually by western forms, since such a union would be a patched-up union, unrelated in any way to what was essentially Indian.  Christian Nationalist  As a Christian Nationalist and a devote Christian leader, Paul saw the rising nationalist feelings in a different dimension. In order to understand his position as a true nationalist one has to look into the then political situations from 1919 to 1930. In 1919 Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms were introduced which were not accepted by the Congress. At this time the Government also passed the Rowlatt Act in the pretext of eradicating terrorism. Most of the Indian leaders thought that these measures were against liberty and thus a betrayal. As a result, the Satygraha Movement was started by Mahatma Gandhi. At first, Paul did not agree with Gandhi's policy. In the tragedy of Chauri Chaura a number of police men were brutally beaten to death by a gang of people who claimed to be Gandhi's followers. This was followed by the Bombay riot. Gandhi suspended the whole Satyagraha indefinitely. But on 10 March 1922, Gandhi was arrested. Immediately after this, Paul was invited by the Viceroy to become a member of the first Round Table Conference. There his main emphasis was on national unity, although he was unable to influence matters much or in the political fields of India. With the partition of Bengal in 1905, the Swadeshi movement had been inaugurated. One way in which the Indian Christians responded to it was by developing indigenous leadership and freedom from foreign domination and dependence within the church. With this idea, the National Missionary Council was founded. It was founded on the principle that it will use only indigenous personnel, methods and money for its work. The Society was never active in politics but because it was purely Indian in its personal and management, it continued to express sympathy to the national movement. The National Missionary Council (NMC) was established in 1912 at Calcutta. NMC comprised British and Indian missionaries. Paul was one of the prominent leaders of this council for many years.  YMCA and K T Paul  Paul was appointed the Joint National General Secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in India in 1913. Dr. John R. Mott, who had attracted Paul to YMCA service later supported his appointment in 1916 as the first Indian National General Secretary of the YMCA in India. Paul began the process of indigenisation of the organisation at a time when practically all Christian institutions were headed by Europeans. Paul was able to Indianise the policy and programs, leading to implementation of new and innovative programmes for the marginalised sections of India. The Rural Reconstruction Scheme was one such programme. His vision for the future of the Indian YMCA was rooted in his understanding of his own people ‚Äì their fears, their hopes and their desperate needs. The YMCA thus far been an urban movement with specific objectives. Paul took it in a new direction, mindful of the peculiar problems of rural Indian society as compared to the industrialised, urban and literate Western society for whose specific needs the YMCA had been created. This however was a herculean task as Paul had to work out substantial details explaining why the Indian YMCA should take up the rural programme and deviate completely from its set path of working for the urban youth.  Rural Reconstruction  Paul was moved by the appalling conditions of poverty of the rural masses who constituted 90 per cent of India's population. Thus he established Rural YMCA Centres to work for the upliftment of rural young men. At this stage, the missionaries too looked to the YMCA for help in the Mass Movement areas where a large number of Christians who were coming over to Christianity brought their problems of poverty, debt and depression with them. Such problems could not be solved in a day. The large number of such converts entering the Church proved to be a burden. Therefore, it was at the urgent request of the missionaries that YMCA began to render help in the field, seeking the cooperation of the church to make it economically possible for those Christians to become honest and self-respecting citizens. Paul worked for the village education scheme and rural reconstruction programme through the YMCA and the church. By launching the Rural Work Programme, Paul had in fact opened a 'campaign against Indian poverty'. No government has so far succeeded in eliminating poverty, but Paul experimented with a methodology to tackle it at its roots. As a keen student of the Indian situation he had taken note of the Co-operative Act passed by Lord Curzon in 1904, followed by another in 1912, meant to help farmers to overcome their serious financial problems. Neither the Co-operative Credit banks of the Government nor its agricultural development departments had succeeded in solving the problem of poverty in rural India. Paul took an intensive study tour of the poverty- stricken districts to supplement he existing knowledge of both the theory and practice of Indian agriculture. He thought that every Indian problem had its roots in rural conditions. Under the guidance of Paul, the YMCA took up responsibility for depressed classes in four districts and set up YMCA Credit Societies to help bankrupt farmers. However it ran into difficulty as the regular District Co-operative Banks of the Government were not willing to give loans to these Societies without adequate property securities of the community who took the loan. Paul's appeal to take the character of the borrower as his credit was rejected by the banks. Social disability which deprived the lower castes, memberships of government Co-operative Credit societies was a problem faced by Christians both in north and south India. Paul argued that the disabilities of Christians are so great that if special attention was not given to them it would take a century for the advantages to reach them. Therefore, special treatment was given to them while non-Christians could become share-holders and beneficiaries. = Madras Christian Co-operative Bank Ltd = Paul decided that if other banks did not give credit, the YMCA should organise a Central Co-operative Bank of its own. He was encouraged in his venture by his friend L. D. Swamikannu Pillai, the Registrar of Co- operative Societies. Madras Christian Co-operative Bank Ltd was started in 1916, with the intention of 25 per cent of net profits being carried to the Reserve Fund and 9 per cent paid as dividend. Although organisations established by Paul were never exclusively for Christians, the presence of Christian communities in the area was a pre-requisite. = Paul's Anti- Poverty Strategy = Then as it is now illiteracy was the bane of India and has been largely responsible for poverty and uncontrolled population growth breeding greater illiteracy and thus creating a vicious circle. The Rural Reconstruction Programme was aimed at removing this ignorance and illiteracy in the villager. The slogan, \\"5 Ds are the enemies of the villagers\\" (Debt, Drink, Disease, Darkness and the Devil), was adopted. By 1921, the rural work had begun to produce productive results. Nearly 40,000 people had been reached and helped towards gaining economic independence. In one of the Districts in Bengal an entire village of outcastes had been liberated. In another village in Madras, the crops of the outcaste converts had increased a hundredfold.  Social Work  Paul began his social work when he was in the YMCA, which before his time was entirely an urban organisation. In the rural areas of India, Christians suffered without any monetary or other kinds of help. In 1912, he decided to extend the co-operative credit movement to rural areas. This formed the basis of his other work in rural areas, which had social, physical and religious themes also. An important outcome of this Rural Work was the appeal it made to the young educated Indian Christians. With the prevailing wave of Nationalism, the young men were asking ‚ÄúHow can I best serve India?‚Äù A large number of young men were responding positively to this nationalistic fervour in developing the rural work started by Paul.

A number of these are known as strangler figs wherein they start upon other trees, later entrapping them entirely and finally killing the host tree. Also called hemiepiphytes, initially, they start as epiphytes or air plants and grow several hanging roots that eventually touch the ground and from then on, encircling and suffocating the host tree. Some of the baletes produce an inferior quality of rubber. The India rubber plant, F. elastica were earlier cultivated to some extent for rubber. Some of the species like tangisang-bayawak or Ficus variegata are large and could probably be utilized for match woods.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Originally it was built on land that had been transferred to a local insurance company by developers of the surrounding affluent Nook Farm neighborhood. They had been unable to make their mortgage payments, and so the lot was subdivided from one of their own properties. Later it was sold to one of the wealthy families that first settled the Asylum Hill neighborhood of Hartford. Most of the other houses from that time on Forest Street have been demolished to clear the way for newer construction, primarily apartment buildings. It is one of the few 19th-century houses left on the street. Currently it is rented out as apartments. Building The house is located on the east side of the street, roughly north of the intersection with Hawthorn Street and a thousand feet north of the onramps over Forest from West Boulevard to the Interstate 84/U.S. Route 6 freeway. The house of Uncle Tom's Cabin author Harriet Beecher Stowe, also listed on the Register, is a similar distance to the north along the east side of Forest. Mark Twain's house for much of his later life, now a National Historic Landmark, is on the main street of the area, Farmington Avenue, two blocks away in the area now designated the Nook Farm and Woodland Street District. Between 36 Forest and the Beecher Stowe House are modern three-story brick apartment buildings, similar to those south of the house. Hartford Public High School is across the street. Behind the house are parking lots and more brick apartment buildings, with other houses to the northeast and southeast. The latter is the home of suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker and her husband John, another Register property in the area. The building itself is a two-and-a- half‚Äìstory shingle-sided wood frame house on a brick foundation. Its main block is a four-by-two-bay section with a gambrel roof intersected with a similar section projecting to the east (rear). A cross-gabled section intersects at the north end. Around the southeast corner is a porch sheltered by a shed roof with gabled portico at the main entrance; a small one-story shed-roofed ell is at the center of the rear. A curved walkway with shrubs on the south, complemented by a driveway on the north, lead across the front yard to the sidewalk and street. Fenestration is irregular due to the many asymmetrical elements of the house form. On the west (front) facade many of the windows are set with nine-over-one double-hung sash windows; the exception is a wide one-over-one south of the main entrance, looking out onto the porch, and one-over-ones in the gabled projection at the north end of the attic and the shed dormer window that pierces the center of that section of roof between the gabled projection and a gambreled dormer. An oriel window projects from the center of the second story. It has an arched window surrounded by classical detailing, a wide frieze with garlands and swag on top and brackets on the bottom. Scroll brackets support the roof on the north and south ends. Other decoration includes corbel-styled wood supports on the northeast gabled projection and a flared course of shingles separating the first and second stories below it. Another decorative course runs along the top of the other second-story windows and between the two on the south side. Between those windows and the sills of the two in the gambreled dormer is a decorative geometric woodwork pattern, with another decorative pattern on either side of the dormer's windows upper pane. Another pattern is located in the upper field of the front portico gable, above a large wooden oval \\"36\\". Smooth square wooden columns with flared capitals support the porch roof, interrupting an iron guardrail. Below the porch floor is wooden latticework. History An 1853 house had stood on the site until it burned down in 1870. It had been the rented residence of the Rev. Nathaniel Judson Burton and his wife Rachel Pine Chase Burton. He was pastor of Hartford's Fourth Congregational Church and later Park Church until his death in 1887. After the fire the property remained vacant at least until 1885, when a map of the area shows a building at the site. In the 1880s, the former Nook Farm area was one of Hartford's most desirable new neighborhoods, with a number of nationally prominent writers living within blocks of each other. Mark Twain lived on Farmington Street. Charles Dudley Warner, his coauthor on The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, a satirical novel which lent its name to the era, lived nearby. Joseph Roswell Hawley, Civil War general, former governor and later publisher of the Hartford Courant, was also in the neighborhood. John Hooker, developer of the neighborhood, and his suffragist wife, Isabella, lived in their house that stands to the southeast on Hawthorne Street. Forest Street's homes, unlike those elsewhere in the Asylum Hill neighborhood which were developed later as smaller, middle-income properties, were large and spacious. Some sources give the date of the current house's construction as 1895. That year John Hooker and his partner, Francis Gillette, encountered difficulty in paying off the mortgage on the Nook Farm properties. Their creditor, the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, instead insisted on a lot taken from Hooker's own, be conveyed to them. It was listed as the owner on next year's city atlas. The company sold the land to A. Lyman Williston, who built the current house. Although the lot was small compared to the other Nook Farm properties, Williston was as wealthy as his neighbors, and the house he built reflects emerging tastes. Its architect is unknown, but its Queen Anne Style forms, with shingled sides, gambrel roofs, overhanging roofs and broad veranda reflect the early Shingle Style. The classical detailing shows the influence of the Free Classical mode that marked the later years of the Queen Anne Style. This prefigured the emergence of the Colonial Revival in the coming century. A later resident of the house was the Burtons' son Richard. An English professor and poet, he compiled some of his father's lectures and sermons into a book later published as In Pulpit and Parish. In 1909 the house was acquired by another local notable, Charles Starkweather. He was a member of Hartford's City Council, Alderman for the Tenth Ward, and a superintendent of the Hartford Trust Company, later part of the Bank of New England. It has since passed through other owners. In 1963, all 11 original Nook Farm houses across the street, including Warner's, were condemned and demolished for the construction of Hartford Public High School. Many of the other old houses on the east side met a similar fate when apartments were constructed. The house at 36 Forest is thus one of the few remaining houses from the original Nook Farm development in its immediate neighborhood. At some time since the property was listed on the National Register in the early 1980s, the house was subdivided into apartments. The management firm, the Surrey Group, used the house as its offices, and had an actual surrey parked on the lawn during that time. In the late 2000s, the company moved to one of the nearby apartment buildings, also under its management, and took the surrey off the lawn.

It is located north of Kochi city. Geography It is an island situated in the Periyar river. Gothuruth is connected to the national highway NH-66, which is very close to it. The island is connected to the mainland by two main bridges, the Gothuruth-Moothakunnam bridge and the Gothuruth-Vadakkumpuram bridge. Religions Christianity is the main religion, accounting for 98% of the population, and the rest are Hindus. The village has two churches - St. Sebastian's Church and Holy Cross Church under Latin Catholic Diocese of Kottapuram, and two convents, St. Joseph's Convent and Vimalalayam Convent. History Scientific studies state that this island was created due to a flood in the early 14th century. It is located where the ancient Roman port city Muziris was once situated. The name of the island came from the Portuguese name of the island San Diego. Culture This is the birthplace of the traditional art form Chavittu Nadakam . Each year a lot of celebrations and cultural programmes took place and so the island is now known as the 'Island of Festivals'. Majority of the population are highly literate and strictly religious; and hence the a very large number of priests from this village. This place was ruled by one and the only Christian royal family in India, called Villarvattom, which means the rulers of the land protected by a bow (villu) shaped river (aaru). Villarvattam was a vassal kingdom under Kochi, at the time of Raja Thoma Villarvattam. This area was ceded to the Kingdom of Kochi, as the Villarvattam family did not have male children, and the female who inherited the throne was married to Paliam royal family.13 Nasrani families under the leadership of Outha Kalathil paid a huge amount of money to Kochi rulers and retained their rights on the land.

Life He was the eldest son of John Hooke, serjeant-at-law, and nephew of Nathaniel Hooke the Jacobite soldier. He is thought by John Kirk to have studied with Alexander Pope at Twyford School, and to have formed a lifelong friendship there. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn 6 February 1702. Caught up in the South Sea Bubble, he sought patronage. He dedicated to the Earl of Oxford a translation from the French of Andrew Michael Ramsay's 'Life of F√©nelon' (published in 1723), London. Other patrons were Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, Richard Onslow, 1st Baron Onslow, Fran√ßois F√©nelon, Pope, George Cheyne, and William King, principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford. When Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough required help with her memoirs, Hooke was recommended to her. He accordingly waited upon the aged duchess while she was still in bed; on his arrival she caused herself to be lifted up, and continued speaking for six hours without notes. Hooke resided in the house until the completion of the work, which appeared in 1742 under the title of An Account of the Conduct of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough from her first coming to Court to the year 1710. Hooke received from the duchess ¬£5,000. During his time with her she commissioned him to negotiate with Pope for the suppression, for payment of ¬£3,000, of the character of 'Atossa' in his 'Epistles'. Owen Ruffhead stated (Life of Pope) that the duchess took a sudden dislike to Hooke because he attempted to convert her to Catholicism. John Whiston, however, asserted that at her death she left ¬£500 a year to Hooke and David Mallet to write the history of the late Duke. It was Hooke who brought a Roman Catholic priest to take Pope's confession on his deathbed. Hooke was also friendly with Martha Blount, who left a legacy to Miss Elizabeth Hooke. Hooke died at Cookham, Berkshire, on 19 July 1763, and was buried in Hedsor churchyard, where a tablet with a Latin inscription to his memory was put up at the expense of his friend Frederick Irby, 2nd Baron Boston, in 1801. Works William Warburton described Hooke as \\"a mystic and quietist, and a warm disciple of F√©nelon\\". Pope suggested that Hooke and Conyers Middleton were the only two contemporary prose-writers whose works were worth consulting by an English lexicographer. Hooke's Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth (four volumes, London, 1738‚Äì1771, 4to), suggested itself to him while he was preparing an index to the English translation of Fran√ßois Catrou and Pierre Julien Rouille's Roman History. The first volume was dedicated to Pope, and introduced by \\"Remarks on the History of the Seven Roman Kings, occasioned by Sir Isaac Newton's Objections to the supposed 244 years of the Royal State of Rome\\". The second volume is dedicated to the Earl of Marchmont, and to it are annexed the Fasti Capitolini, or the consular lists, discovered at Rome during the pontificate of PopePaul III in 1545. The third volume was printed under Hooke's inspection, but was not published until 1764, after his death. The fourth volume was published in 1771, edited by Gilbert Stuart. The whole work was frequently reprinted; the latest edition, in six volumes, appeared in 1830. Other works are: * ‚ÄòTravels of Cyrus, with a Discourse on Mythology,‚Äô London, 1739, translated by Hooke from the French of Andrew Michael Ramsay. * 'Observations on‚ÄîI.

Hooke revised Thomas Townsend's translation of Antonio de Sol√≠s's History of the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards (1753).

He has planned and designed landscapes in the United States, Canada, and France, including waterfronts, parks, college campuses, sculpture gardens, and private gardens. Collaborating with Michael Van Valkenburgh, he was a lead designer of many projects in the Northeastern United States, including Brooklyn Bridge Park, Alumnae Valley at Wellesley College, Allegheny Riverfront Park, and Teardrop Park. In addition to his work as a designer, Urbanski is a co-owner of a native plants nursery in New Jersey. Early years and schooling Matthew Urbanski was born in 1963 and grew up in Holmdel, New Jersey. Urbanski attended Albright College and graduated in 1985 with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in biology. From 1985‚Äì1986 he studied horticulture at the Delaware Valley College of Science and Agriculture. Urbanski attended Harvard's Graduate School of Design, receiving his Master of Landscape Architecture degree in 1989. One of Urbanski‚Äôs design instructors while at Harvard was Michael Van Valkenburgh. Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, Inc. Urbanski joined Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates (MVVA) in 1989, a move that surprised many classmates because he and Van Valkenburgh had frequently argued while Urbanski was at Harvard. Urbanski became a firm Principal in 2000. He and Van Valkenburgh are frequently listed as co-designers on many of the firm‚Äôs projects. Design approach Matthew Urbanski began his career at MVVA working on both small gardens and on larger projects, most notably Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana. As a designer, Urbanski frequently uses plantings in dramatic ways that create a strong sense of contrast when read against other aspects of their context. Examples of this include the use of birches and meadow plantings in the General Mills entry garden (now destroyed) and the steeply planted hills of Teardrop Park. Van Valkenburgh and Urbanski have coined the term ‚Äúhypernature‚Äù to describe this aspect of their work. Urbanski has emerged as a leader in the firm‚Äôs efforts to redefine the way that urban landscapes are planned and built, most notably in the Brooklyn Bridge Park project and the Lower Don Lands plan. He makes the argument that the city, which consists of a series of interdependent systems, resembles a landscape more than it does a building. In working with planners, engineers, and architects to reclaim formerly industrial territories, Urbanski and MVVA promote integrated approaches to urban systems and greater awareness of the role that landscape space and ecological function play in the quality of urban life. In a paper entitled ‚ÄúDo Landscape Architects Make the Best Urban Designers‚Äù that he delivered at the 2009 ‚ÄúLandscape ‚Äì Great Idea‚Äù X-L.Arch III conference in Vienna, Urbanski laid out the concept of ‚Äúlandscape imagination‚Äù that he feels differentiates the urban design work of MVVA from traditional urban planning. While traditional urban planners had difficulty in moving beyond ‚Äúthe well-intentioned infusion of undifferentiated green spaces,‚Äù Urbanski felt that landscape architects in general and MVVA in particular had ‚Äúfaith in the landscape‚Äôs ability to resolve difficult urban adjacencies‚Äù and that they were more likely to ‚Äúunderstand how this full range of landscape typologies can be brought to bear on the problems of the contemporary city.‚Äù Design language Urbanski is credited with phrases that describe paradoxes encountered in contemporary design: *‚ÄúProposed Existing Condition‚Äù ‚Äì refers to a project‚Äôs anticipated context, something that does not exist at the moment that the design investigation is taking place. Coined in conjunction with work on Teardrop Park, a courtyard-type park that was planned and built before the towers that eventually surrounded it. *‚ÄùPermanent Temporary Condition‚Äù ‚Äì refers to an urban condition that was meant to be temporary, but ended up being permanent. Originally used to refer to metal barricades located along the northern boundary of the Union Square Park Plaza. Design awards Urbanski has been a co-designer or lead designer on many works by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates that have gone on to win professional awards. Some of these awards include: *Honor Award from the Boston Society of Landscape Architects for Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana, 1993 *Design Merit Award, ASLA for the Vera List Courtyard at the New School for Social Research, New York, NY, 1998 *Planning and Analysis Merit Award, ASLA, for Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA 1999 *Citation from Progressive Architecture for Allegheny Riverfront Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 2002 *Design Merit Award, ASLA, Allegheny Riverfront Park, Pittsburgh, PA, 2002 *Places Magazine/EDRA Place Design Award, Allegheny Riverfront Park, Pittsburgh, PA, 2002 *Design Merit Award, ASLA, Spider Island, Chicago Botanic Garden, Glenncoe, IL, 2002 *Design Honor Award, ASLA, for the Herman Miller Factory Landscape, Cherokee County, GA 2005 *Design Excellence Award, ASLA, for Alumnae Valley at Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA, 2006 *Planning and Analysis Honor Award, for the Lower Don Lands project, Toronto, ON, 2008 *Planning and Analysis Honor Award, for the Brooklyn Bridge Park Master Plan, Brooklyn, NY 2009 *Design Honor Award, ASLA, for Teardrop Park, New York, NY, 2009 *Design Honor Award, ASLA, for Connecticut Water Treatment Facility, New Haven, CT, 2010 Publications *Taking Measures Across the American Landscape, M.

Murphey and Joel Soisson. Filmed in the United States in 1985, The Supernaturals was released by Embassy Pictures in 1986, and has never been re-released since its original VHS Video rental format but is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.  Plot  During the American Civil War, deep in the sullen backwoods of the Southern United States, a Confederate town is held captive, the soldiers forced to walk through a piece of woodland laced with mines. Because he is found wearing a Confederate States Army outfit, Jeremy (Chad Sheets), a young boy is also forced to make the crossing. If they make it across the minefield the Union Army 44th will set them free. Only Jeremy and his mother (Melanie) - who runs to save him - survive, despite the fact that the mother has stepped on a mine. Jeremy exhibits unearthly powers. Jump to circa 1985 and a platoon of soldiers are out on manouevres in the same backwoods. They too are the 44th, descendants of the Union platoon of years before, those who committed the atrocities. The main character here is Pvt. Ray Ellis (Maxwell Caulfield), the only soldier to catch glimpses of the beautiful and mysterious Melanie; Ellis also has a romantic interest in Pvt. Angela Lejune (Talia Balsam). The platoon decide to camp inside a circle of yellow grass seemingly caused by brush fire, a spot from which the wind only blows outward. Pvt. Ellis is reluctant to camp there, but Sgt. Hawkins does not like having her authority undermined. Whilst the platoon are setting up camp, Melanie reappears - this time witnessed by all in the platoon - and takes a strong interest in Pvt. Ellis who bears an uncanny resemblance to her husband, Evan. Trouble for Sgt. Leona Hawkins (Nichelle Nichols) and her platoon begins with the soldiers' drunken and childish antics; however, events take a sinister turn when Pvt. Cort (Bobby Di Cicco) is found shot in the head. They inexplicably lose radio contact and the nearest town is over twenty miles away. Hawkins and her platoon go in search of - and arrest - Melanie, who lives in an old wooden shack with what looks to be her father or grandfather, a withered old man. In the cabin, they discover the relics of muskets and an old diary, written by Evan. They take Melanie back to camp, but leave the old man at the cabin; he is too old and frail to go anywhere. During the night, an eerie fog rolls in, encompassing the 44th, and the Confederate Dead close in on their camp. Most of the 44th are subsequently killed - one-by-one - whilst Pvt. Ellis heads off into the woods in search of the old man who, it turns out, is Jeremy (he has used his powers to keep his mother the same age). Along the way he is forced to do battle with the Confederate zombies and also runs into Melanie, who shows him a locket. Inside is a picture of Evan, and Ellis immediately recognizes the resemblance. He snatches the locket from around her neck and runs in the direction of the cabin. Once there he persuades Jeremy to end the evil spell and send Melanie and the zombies back to wherever it is the dead are supposed go. Exhausted, Jeremy dies and Ellis returns to the camp where Lejune and Hawkins are waiting, the only survivors. Ellis embraces Lejune and the locket falls from his hand to the woodland floor, where it is lost amongst the leaves.Lee- Williams, Matt: Supernaturals, The, Synopsis, Amazon [accessed] April 28, 2011.

Mixon performed the make-up and special effects. He has also worked on films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge and Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Mixon worked with Ed Ferrell, Shannon Shea and Mark Shostrom on The Supernaturals: he describes them as \\"a very small but talented crew\\". Mixon said he administered a \\"forehead appliance on Bobby Di Cicco with a bullet hole in it\\": Di Cicco had just finished filming 1941 and was then an up-and-coming actor. He also worked with Maxwell Caulfield (star of the musical film Grease 2 (1982)), and with Star Trek regulars LeVar Burton and Nichelle Nichols. Mixon goes on to praise The Supernaturals for not following in the footsteps of George A. Romero, calling the film original. However, a limited and subsequently slashed budget meant that Prosthetic makeup gave way to head masks. \\"I think our work turned out very well,\\" Mixon comments on the finished product, \\"and I wish it was shown off a little better in the final film\\". Soundtrack Originally, the soundtrack to The Supernaturals was scored by Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees. The score was rejected, though, in favour of one written by Robert O. Ragland. Gibb can be seen in The Supernaturals in a cameo role as a Union soldier. Reception Best-Horror-Movies call The Supernaturals an \\"original horror film\\" and one which is \\"interesting\\". Bruce Kooken of HorrorNews.Net wrote, \\"The Supernaturals just wasn‚Äôt a good movie is all.

Stakeholders are any entity that has an interest, actually or potentially, in there being more entrepreneurship in the region. Entrepreneurship stakeholders may include government, schools, universities, private sector, family businesses, investors, banks, entrepreneurs, social leaders, research centers, military, labor representatives, students, lawyers, cooperatives, communes, multinationals, private foundations, and international aid agencies. In order to explain or create sustainable entrepreneurship, one isolated element in the ecosystem is rarely sufficient. In regions which have extensive amounts of entrepreneurship, including Silicon Valley, Boston, New York City, and Israel, many of the ecosystem elements are strong and typically have evolved in tandem. Similarly, the formation of these ecosystems suggests that governments or societal leaders who want to foster more entrepreneurship as part of economic policy must strengthen several such elements simultaneously. However, recent research shows that government policy is often limited in what it can do to develop entrepreneurial ecosystems.\\"Entrepreneurship Ecosystems and Growth-Oriented Entrepreneurship\\", Report for the OECD LEED Programme, Paris; Mason, C. and Brown, R. 2014. In July 2010, the Harvard Business Review published an article by Daniel Isenberg, Professor of Entrepreneurship Practice at Babson College, entitled ‚ÄúHow to Start an Entrepreneurial Revolution.‚Äù\\"How to Start an Entrepreneurial Revolution\\" Harvard Business Review. Retrieved June 2010. In this article, Isenberg describes the environment in which entrepreneurship tends to thrive. Drawing from examples from around the world, the article proposes that entrepreneurs are most successful when they have access to the human, financial and professional resources they need, and operate in an environment in which government policies encourage and safeguard entrepreneurs. This network is described as the entrepreneurship ecosystem. The Babson College Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Project then categorizes this framework into these domains: policy, finance, culture, supports, human capital and markets. * Policy covers government regulations and support. * Finance domain includes the full spectrum of financial services available to entrepreneurs. * Culture covers societal norms and success stories that help to inspire people to become entrepreneurs. * Support domain includes non-governmental institutions, infrastructure and the professionals support such as investment bankers, technical experts and advisors. * Markets cover entrepreneurial networks and customers. * Human capital includes education system and the skill level of the workforce. Several academic researchers have begun to investigate entrepreneurial ecosystems as well. SpigelSpigel (2017) The Relational Organization of Entrepreneurial Ecosystems. 41(1): 49-72 DOI: 10.1111/etap.12167 suggests that ecosystems require cultural attributes (a culture of entrepreneurship and histories of successful entrepreneurship), social attributes that are accessed through social ties (worker talent, investment capital, social networks, and entrepreneurial mentors) and material attributes grounded in a specific places (government policies, universities, support services, physical infrastructure, and open local markets). StamStam (2015) Entrepreneurial Ecosystems and Regional Policy: A Sympathetic Critique. European Planning Studies 23(9): 1759-1769. DOI: 10.1080/09654313.2015.1061484 distinguishes between framework conditions of ecosystems (formal institutions, culture, physical infrastructure, and market demand) with systematic conditions of networks, leadership, finance, talent, knowledge, and support services. There are several key conditions that typically define a healthy ecosystem. The ecosystem: * is tailored around its own unique environment ‚Äì it does not seek to be something it isn‚Äôt, like the ‚Äúnext Silicon Valley‚Äù * operates in an environment with reduced bureaucratic obstacles in which government policies support the unique needs of entrepreneurs and tolerate failed ventures * actively encourages and invites financiers to participate in new ventures - although access to money isn‚Äôt without barriers for those planning new business ventures * is reinforced, not created from scratch, by government, academic or commercial organizations * is relatively free from, or is able to change the cultural biases against failure or operating a business * promotes successes, which in turn attract new ventures * is supported by dialogue among various of the entrepreneurship stakeholders Related Content Startup Ecosystem - following the financial downturn of 2008 and the long lasting slow growth period, there have been increasing focus towards fostering more startup company creation around the world to further target regional support efforts towards those type of companies that have higher innovation, growth and job creation potential. This has also led to an increasing focus on startup ecosystem development. University-based Entrepreneurship Ecosystem ‚Äì Entrepreneurship thrives in ecosystems in which multiple stakeholders play key roles. Academic institutions are central in shaping young people‚Äôs attitudes, skills and behaviours. However, actors outside of the education systems play an increasingly critical role in working with formal and informal educational programmes as well as reaching out to underserved and socially excluded targets groups. This requires collaboration and multistakeholder partnerships. Entrepreneurship ecosystems commonly refer to academic programs within a university that focus on the development of student/graduate entrepreneurs and/or the commercialization of technology or intellectual property developed at the university level.\\"The Entrepreneurship Ecosystem,\\" MIT Technology Review. Retrieved September 2005.\\"Entrepreneurial Impact: The Role of MIT,\\" Kauffman Foundation. Retrieved February 2009. However before the entrepreneurial ecosystem can bloom, the education system must embrace the idea that entrepreneurship is a core element of higher education. Business cluster ‚Äì A business cluster is a geographic concentration of interconnected businesses, suppliers, and associated institutions in a particular field. Early research was done in this context by Benjamin Chinitz in 1961. Chinitz posed several theories, but most importantly noticed a correlation between average firm size and average growth rates within regions.Chinitz, Benjamin. ‚ÄúContrasts in Agglomeration: New York and Pittsburgh.‚Äù The American Economic Review, Vol. 51, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Seventy-Third Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association. (May, 1961): 279-289. In addition, Glaeser, Kerr and Ponzetto followed up this research and confirmed the relationship between smaller average firm size and higher growth rates.Glaeser, Edward L, William R. Kerr, and Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto, ‚ÄùClusters of Entrepreneurship‚Äù (NBER Working Paper Series, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA, 2009). Chatterji, Glaeser and Kerr also noted that some of the most famous entrepreneurial clusters (Silicon Valley, Boston's Route 128 Corridor, and Research Triangle Park) were located near large research universities.Chatterji, Aaron, Edward Glaeser, and William Kerr. \\"Clusters of Entrepreneurship and Innovation.\\" NBER Innovation Policy & the Economy (University of Chicago Press) 14, no. 1 (2014): 129-66. Governments often look to clusters to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship in their region. When clusters are applied to entrepreneurship, experts agree governments should not seek to create new clusters, but rather reinforce existing ones.\\"Clusters and the New Economics of Competition,\\" Harvard Business Review.

Holland was born the son of an admiral, and he followed his father into the navy, rising through the ranks and serving on a number of ships. He was serving at the rank of lieutenant on a cruiser at the start of the First World War. He saw out the war aboard battleships in home water and the Mediterranean, punctuated with time ashore, and with a special interest in signalling and naval communications. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander after the war, and was in the Mediterranean during the Turkish War of Independence. He graduated to his own commands shortly after, commanding a cruiser on the China Station, then a destroyer in the Mediterranean. He became a naval attach√© in Paris shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, and remained in the position until April 1940. Recalled to Britain at the fall of France, Holland assumed command of the aircraft carrier , which he commanded during several actions and operations. He was prominent in the negotiations in the run up to the Attack on Mers-el- K√©bir in July 1940, when the French fleet refused to agree to terms to either surrender or disarm to keep their fleet out of German hands. Holland left Ark Royal in 1941 to become chief of staff to Lord Gort, and later director of naval communications at the Admiralty. He spent the last years of the war as principal administrative officer with the Eastern Fleet, having been promoted to rear-admiral and then vice-admiral. His distinguished service brought him a number of accolades; he was twice Mentioned in Despatches, was appointed a Commander of the Legion of Merit, a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy and a Companion of the Bath. Holland retired from naval service in 1946, and died in 1950. Family and early life Cedric Holland was born in Alverstoke on 13 October 1889 to Eva Williams and her husband Swinton Colthurst Holland, who would rise to be an admiral. Cedric followed his father into the navy, joining HMS Britannia as a cadet on 15 January 1905, graduating as a midshipman on 15 May 1906 and going to serve aboard the armoured cruiser in the Mediterranean. He transferred to the battleship , also in the Mediterranean, on 3 September 1907, and then to in Home waters on 18 February 1908, where he remained until 14 September 1909. Last years of peace and the First World War Holland served for a period as acting sub-lieutenant, then was appointed sub-lieutenant on 30 September 1909. He was promoted to lieutenant on 31 August 1911. He served at this rank aboard the armoured cruiser , part of the Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. He was aboard Shannon at the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, and remained there until November 1914. Holland served as flag lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Mark Kerr aboard between June 1916 and May 1917, during her time in the Mediterranean as flagship of the British Squadron in the Adriatic. He served aboard for Signalling and Wireless Telegraphy duties with the Grand Fleet, from May 1917 until April 1919. Post First World War , which Holland commanded on the China Station between 1928 and 1929 Holland was gazetted on 4 April 1919 'for valuable services rendered in connection with the War'. For his services during the war he was made a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy. He continued an active career at sea, being promoted to lieutenant- commander on 31 August 1919 and serving as Squadron Wireless Officer aboard , based in the Mediterranean in 1920 during the Turkish War of Independence. Holland was advanced to commander on 31 December 1924, and between July 1928 and August 1929 he commanded on the China Station, during which time he visited ports in China, South-East Asia and Japan. His service in this region allowed him to attend the funeral of Dr Sun Yat-sen on 31 May 1929, and the annual Naval Regatta at Wei-Hai-Wei. He was promoted to captain on 30 June 1932, and in 1934 he took command of the destroyer , serving in the Mediterranean until 1936. Holland was a skilled French speaker and was posted as Naval Attach√© for France, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal from January 1938 to April 1940, and was the Head of the Naval Mission to the French Admiralty from the outbreak of war in September 1939 until April 1940. Second World War Holland returned from his services with the French and in May 1940 took command of the aircraft carrier , which he commanded until May 1941. Ark Royal participated in a number of key theatres of the war, and Holland commanded it during Operation Alphabet, the transport of troops from Narvik to Britain, numerous convoy escort missions through the Mediterranean, bombing raids on the Italian mainland, and the search for the German raiders Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. Mers-el-K√©bir Strasbourg under fire during the Attack on Mers-el-K√©bir. Holland was the British representative at the talks, but could not stop the breakdown of negotiations. Holland was particularly involved in the attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-K√©bir in July 1940. A British fleet, Force H, was despatched under Admiral Sir James Somerville to insist the French either demilitarize their ships or hand them over to the British, to prevent their capture by the Germans. Holland, as a French speaker with experience from his time as naval attach√© in Paris, was sent to deliver the terms and enter negotiations with the French naval officers. He was taken into Mers-el-K√©bir with the ultimatum aboard early on 2 July. Holland and Somerville were strongly opposed to the use of force, hoping that a show of strength would be enough to convince the French to avoid fighting. Apparently offended by Somerville's sending a junior officer to deal with him, the French commander, Admiral Marcel-Bruno Gensoul at first refused to meet Holland, and delegated his flag lieutenant, Bernard Dufay, to meet him instead. The negotiations dragged on for several hours, with the French unwilling to agree to terms. With French reinforcements reportedly en route, Holland tried to convince Somerville that the French crews were being reduced, and would sail to Martinique. But it was too little and came too late, the Admiralty pressed for a resolution and Holland was ordered to break off negotiations, and was taken back to his ship by . Twenty minutes after his arrival the British attacked, sinking several ships and badly damaging others. Staff posts and flag rank Holland left Ark Royal in May 1941 due to health problems, and was replaced by Captain Loben Maund. He became Chief of Staff to Lord Gort at Gibraltar, having been appointed a Naval Aide-de-camp on 17 July 1941. He was twice mentioned in despatches for his services commanding Ark Royal, gazetted on 27 June 1941, and again on 2 January 1942. He was with Gort until January 1942, when he became Director of Naval Communications at the Admiralty, holding the post until November 1943. He was promoted to rear- admiral on 6 February 1942, early in this posting, and on stepping down as director, became principal administrative officer for the navy in South-East Asia. His appointment marked the first of its kind, and he held it until September 1945, having been promoted to vice-admiral on 1 June 1945. During his time in the Far East he was involved in planning and carrying out Operation Tiderace, the re-occupation of Singapore, flying his flag aboard . Post-war Vice-Admiral Holland retired from active service in 1946. The American government appointed him a Commander of the Legion of Merit for 'distinguished services to the Allied Cause', and he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1945. Vice-Admiral Cedric Holland died on 11 May 1950 at the age of 60. Collections of his papers are held at the National Maritime Museum. Family and issue Holland married Agnes Barbara Dillwyn-Venables-Llewelyn, the daughter of Sir Charles Dillwyn-Venables- Llewellyn, 2nd Baronet, on 15 June 1925. The couple had two children, Katherine J. Holland, born in 1927, and John Swinton Holland, born in 1928.

It differs from simple contagion in that unlike a disease, it may not be possible for the innovation to spread after only one incident of contact with an infected neighbor. The spread of complex contagion across a network of people may depend on many social and economic factors; for instance, how many of one's friends adopt the new idea as well as how many of them cannot influence the individual, as well as their own disposition in embracing change. Mechanisms Complex Contagion and the Weakness of Long Ties by Damon Centola of University of Pennsylvania and Michael Macy of Cornell University found that information and disease spread as ‚Äúsimple contagions‚Äù, requiring only one contact for transmission, while behaviors typically spread as ‚Äúcomplex contagions‚Äù, requiring multiples sources of reinforcement to induce adoption. Centola‚Äôs work builds on Granovetter‚Äôs work on the strength of weak ties and threshold models of collective behavior, as well as Duncan Watts and Steve Strogatz‚Äôs work on small world networks.http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5996/1194 Centola and Macy show that the weak ties and small worlds networks are both very good for spreading simple contagions. However, for complex contagions, weak ties and small worlds can slow diffusion. Centola and Macy suggest four mechanisms of complex contagion. These properties explain the need for multiple exposures in the spread of contagion: #Strategic complementarity. Many innovations are costly, especially for early adopters but less so for those who wait. The same holds for participation in collective action. #Credibility. Innovations often lack credibility until adopted by neighbors. Hearing the same story from different people makes it seem less likely that surprising information is nothing more than the fanciful invention of the informant. #Legitimacy. Knowing that a movement exists or that a collective action will take place is rarely sufficient to induce bystanders to join in. Having several close friends participate in an event often greatly increases an individual‚Äôs likelihood of also joining, especially for high-risk social movements. Innovators risk being shunned as deviants until there is a critical mass of early adopters, and non-adopters are likely to challenge the legitimacy of the innovation. #Emotional contagion. Most theoretical models of collective behavior ‚Äì from action theory to threshold models to cybernetics share the basic assumption that there are expressive and symbolic impulses in human behavior that can be communicated and amplified in spatially and socially concentrated gatherings. Contested vs. uncontested ;Uncontested :The spread of the contagion is dependent solely on the number of people you are connected to who are different from your own state. You are not hindered whatsoever by the number of people in the same state as you. Generally, the more neighbors an individual has, the greater the chance of the individual adopting the innovation if the spread is uncontested. ;Contested :The spread of the contagion is dependent on both the adamancy of those who are in a different state from your own as well as the countervailing influence of those who share your current state. In this case, the more neighbors an individual has, the smaller the chance of the individual adopting the innovation. Diffusion and cascading behaviors in networks Consider a graph of any reasonable size. Node v‚Äôs neighbors can be split into two sets: Set A contains v's neighbors who have adopted a new behavior and B is the set of those behaving conservatively. Node v will only adopt the behavior of those in A if at least a q fraction of neighbors follow behavior A. *if q is small, the behavior is easily adopted and easily spread *if q is large, B is an attractive behavior and it takes more friends to engage in A before v will switch. ;Cascading ‚Äì diffusion over the entire network : Consider a set of initial adopters who start with a new behavior A, while every other node starts with behavior B. Nodes then repeatedly evaluate the decision to switch from B to A using a threshold of q. If the resulting cascade of adoptions of A eventually causes every node to switch from B to A, then we say that the set of initial adopters causes a complete cascade at threshold q. Clusters of density d > 1 ‚àí q are obstacles to cascades across the entire network. Application and examples Many of our interactions with the rest of the world happen at a local, rather than a global, level ‚Äì we often don't care as much about the full population's decisions as about the decisions made by friends and colleagues. For example, in a work setting we may choose technology to be compatible with the people we directly collaborate with, rather than the universally most popular technology. Similarly, we may adopt political views that are aligned with those of our friends, even if they are nationally in the minority.

Biography Macaulay was born in Aithernie, Fife in Scotland near Lundin standing stones, the youngest child of Alison and Sir David Russell. Her family soon moved to Silverburn near Lundin Links where her father managed a paper-making business through the Great Depression and had interests in religion, archaeology, industry and a good sense of family values. She attended St Leonards School in St Andrews during the Second World War going on to briefly attend the University of Edinburgh which she departed for South Africa she learned how to fly an aeroplane. Around this time her brother, Patrick Russell died and she accompanied her father to Istanbul where he had funded an archaeological excavation. It was here that she met Bill Macaulay, curator of the Glasgow Museum of Art and an expert in mosaics and Byzantine art whom her father held in high esteem. In 1953, they married and moved to Johnsburn House in Balerno near the Pentland Hills. Together they had five children, the last in born in 1957. She developed an interest in classical guitar, which she learned to play to a high standard. This led to an interest in Pythagorean mathematics and its relationship with music. It was from this that her interest in stone circles and prehistoric geometry developed and she began to read the work of Alexander Thom. Over the next several years, she proceeded to resurvey much of Thom's work and travelled widely to Turkey, Malta, Egypt, Greece and throughout the British Isles in search of further evidence of his ideas. After the break up of her marriage to Bill in 1971 she worked for 17 years trying to bring her work and the mass of data she had recorded into order. Her work became well known to other academics and musicians such as Professor Jay Kappraff, Keith Critchlow, Andrew Glazewski and Paul Segovia. She lectured at conferences and symposia in the United States and the UK and in 1994 was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the University of Edinburgh. Macaulay's research interests included the origin of the alphabet, history of the guitar, the deity Apollo, and pythagorean mysteries. She was a trustee of the Salisbury Centrehttp://www.salisburycentre.org The Salisbury Center, Edinburgh in Edinburgh and lectured for the Research into Lost Knowledge Organization (RILKO). She died early, in 1998, but her family said of her \\"She was fortunate to walk with many who knew the ancient ways, and she uncovered the truth as easily as drinking a cup of tea\\". Megalithic measures and rhythms Macaulay's work was posthumously collated, edited and published in 2006 by Vivian T. Linacre, a Perth based surveyor who is president of the British Weights and Measures Association (an advocacy group for Imperial units and Richard A. Batchelor, an honorary Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews, geologist and investigator into the geometry of Fife. The book contains a critical re-assessment of the geometry used in over one hundred and eighty of the stone circles surveyed by Alexander Thom (who surveyed over two hundred) along with their mensuration using the megalithic yard and the megalithic rod. From Professor Fernie's 1981 studies of the Metrological Relief in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (which Macaulay gives by its previous name The Arundel Stone) she claimed a similarity between the Greek Fathom and the megalithic rod of 2.072 m. She also suggested that many of the megaliths had been designed using a \\"third yardstick\\" length of one Greek Foot, depicted on the Metrological relief at 0.296 m, or one seventh of a megalithic rod. Concerning this claim, Jay Kappraff wrote \\"However, according to the archaeological record, there was no standard unit of a 'foot' in ancient Greece.\\" She found that the best direct evidence for the use of an ancient unit of measure in megalithic Britain at the fan of stone rows in Mid Clyth. Douglas Heggie had found this gave the strongest evidence for an early unit of measure of any site in the UK. Heggie was very dubious about the existence of the megalithic yard, stating that his careful analysis uncovered \\"little evidence for a highly accurate unit\\" and \\"little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use\\".Heggie 1981 p. 58 Macaulay suggested that a high culture of bards (or druids) emerged following an influx of Indo- European farming techniques into Britain in the 5th millennium BC. This culture were able to determine pythagorean mathematics from harmonious sounding triads played on ancient Lyres.Sherbon, Michael A., Pythagorean Geometry and Fundamental Constants, SSRN Classics: Journal of Philosophical & Scientific Texts (27 October 2007). These mathematics were then suggested to have been used in the construction of stone circles and exported back to Greece via the tin trade.

The Kenya water crisis is the fight to supply clean water to the population in that country. The human population depends heavily on water resources, not only as a drinking water but also for crops, agriculture and livestock and fishing. For example, wetland grasses are used to feed and keep livestock. Human populations throughout Kenya have been affected by a lack of clean drinking water due in large part to the overuse of land and increases in community settlements. A specific example of this is in the Mau Forest, in the highlands of Kenya, that is a major watershed for the country. In the Mau Complex individuals have used land for their personal gain, creating homes and farms at the expense of the natural biodiversity.United Nations Environmental Programme. Mau Complex Under Siege. 2005. Print The destruction of trees throughout the forest has caused severe soil erosion, which pollutes the water. This phenomenon exists all over the country and with the addition of animal and human waste into already polluted water, it has made finding clean water more difficult for Kenyan citizens. The current water conditions have caused a number of issues including many diseases and tribal conflicts over the remaining water resources.Mwangi, Wilson. Baseline survey of the Molo River. Molo, Kenya: Network for Ecofarming in Africa. 2009. Print Additionally, as clean water becomes harder to find, women are forced to walk for many miles each day to find the water needed for the family. Another huge problem with clean water in Kenya has been an influx of individuals moving to large cities such as Nairobi, which creates large slum areas that have some of the worst living conditions and most polluted water in the whole country. This interaction between humans and water is currently at a crucial point in Kenya as the nation faces a major shortage in the ability for citizens to receive the water they desperately need. Only significant improvements in land management and environmental policies can help make sure this country has the water it needs on its way to becoming a developed country. Population growth Understanding Kenya's environmental situation requires looking not only at the environment but social, economic, and political factors that play an important factor in a still-developing country. With a quickly expanding population, sustaining the environment and sustaining the growing population is a challenge. The population continues to increase while the economy and resources struggle to keep up. Kenya's population faces high rates of poverty, up to 43% in 2000.Page, Kara. ‚ÄúUSAID/ \\"Kenya Strategic Plan: Environmental Threats and Opportunities Assessment\\". Natural Resource Management and Development Portal. (2000): 1‚Äì40. In a population that relies heavily on agriculture as a way of life, it is difficult to limit agriculture and protect the environment without taking away a resource many people in this growing population need to survive. The quickly growing population puts pressure on water resources through agriculture, land and energy uses as well as other factors. The geographic location of water resources in Kenya is also a key factor. Water is not distributed equally throughout the country, leaving large places of drylands and specific areas of life and productivity surrounding water resources. About 80% (percent) of Kenya's water resources are completely unprotected but not undamaged by the growing population and agricultural practices. Wildlife The Kenyan government is bankrupt and dump important partly because it is a limited resource but also because some of Kenya's water systems are recognised internationally for their importance to species diversity and bird migration. Water issues directly affect wildlife, since the availability of drinking water is a necessity for survival. Wildlife is also indirectly affected by the human population's use of water to support livestock and agriculture, which compete with wildlife for limited water resources. Kenya is known for its species diversity and richness; it is in the top 50 countries of species richness. It also has one of the highest percentages of threatened mammal species. Impact of deforestation on water resources Forests are important in protecting water catchment areas. When large areas of forest are logged, ecosystem services such as water supply may be negatively affected. Kenya has one of the most diverse forests in East Africa,. but these forests are threatened because they are heavily used as a source of fuel or converted to agricultural land. Logging for fuel is one of the main reasons forests are threatened. Out of 22 million tons of wood products used in Kenya, 20 million are used for fuel. Large areas will continue to be deforested if current logging rates and population growth do not decrease. An additional problem when land is deforested for agriculture is that forests often grow on poor soils that are unsuitable for agriculture. Therefore, farmers continue deforesting new areas when soil nutrients become too scarce to support crop farming. There is a great deal of activism surrounding water resources in Kenya. The communities that are affected by these water issues have many solutions to these problems. There are also many organisations that aid these communities. However, this has not solved the problem. There are simultaneously many forces that work against the solution to the water problem in Kenya. There are several organisations that work towards helping cope and solve the water problem in Kenya. Quest4Change, water.org and WaterRelief are examples of such organisations.WaterRelief‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Kenya ‚Äì Quest Overseas.\\" Gap Year Specialists ‚Äì Quest Overseas. Web. 5 Mar 2011. .Quest4Change  Web. 5 March 2011. Home Page Through their work, they have provided clean water to many people who need it. Building wells is one thing that these organisations often do. Though the actual production of the well only takes a few days, the planning takes a few months. It is found that when communities request help building a well, these communities are more successful in maintaining their water supply than communities that are approached and just given a well.K'akumu, O. A. \\"Mainstreaming the Participatory Approach in Water Resource Governance: The 2002 water law in Kenya.\\" Development 51.1 (2008): 56‚Äì62. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. A water committee is elected to guide the well building process. Many materials such as stones need to be hauled to the site. Geological surveys show if there is a good site. The hole is drilled and once water is hit a pump is installed and cement cap put in place.K'akumu, O. A. \\"Mainstreaming the Participatory Approach in Water Resource Governance: The 2002 water law in Kenya.\\" Development 51.1 (2008): 56‚Äì62. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. This allows people in Kenya to have a safe, accessible water source . These organisations also build small dams for communities. This allows communities to have water sources in times of droughts and gives them more reliable access to and consumption of clean water.K'akumu, O. A. \\"Mainstreaming the Participatory Approach in Water Resource Governance: The 2002 water law in Kenya.\\" Development 51.1 (2008): 56‚Äì62. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. Education is another important aspect of these organisations. They teach people the importance of having clean water and proper sanitation to prevent disease and increase health. Mau Forest The Mau Forest has lost a fourth of its original cover since the 1980s.Charles Maina Gichaba, et al. \\"Assessing land cover change in Kenya's Mau Forest region using remotely sensed data.\\" African Journal of Ecology 46.1 (2008): 46‚Äì54. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. Ogiek people have traditionally occupied the forest. They maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle that is very sustainable. There has been an increase in the population in the forest. Much of the growth has been due to immigration. This new population has cleared forest land and lead less sustainable lifestyles. The land is now being used for housing and industrial purposes. This urban encroachment has led to encroachment and excessive use of the river waters. The drying up of these rivers is very concerning. Many communities use these rivers downstream of the headwaters. Since these rivers are being threatened at their source, they are not providing as much water for the many people that need it further downriver. It also threatens many other natural aspects of the forest. The rivers are important for river flow regulation, flood mitigation, water storage, reduced soil erosion, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, carbon reservoir and microclimate regulation. There have been community movements to save and restore the state of this forest. However, restoring the forest requires the displacement of a little less than 2,000 people who hold land deeds in the forest. There are other efforts to help the people living in the forest do so in a more ecologically friendly way. The Greenbelt movement pays people to plant trees. This is an incentive, but the outcome still seems bleak as these tribes are more interested in their own wellbeing than that of people miles down the river. Government in Kenya's water crisis Kenya's government does not have the funds to maintain strong piping systems. More than half of Kenya's population does not have regular access to piped water, and for those that do the water is often dangerously unsanitary thanks to poorly constructed systems suffering from malfunctions and vandalism. A number of acts and reforms have been put into motion to aid Kenya's situation, but the country still suffers from a water crisis worse than almost any other in the world. In 1974, the government launched the National Water Master Plan, with the goal of having drinkable and available water within walking distance of every household by the year 2000.http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001488/148866e.pdf Due to a conflict between urban areas that have undergone water privatisation and rural areas where investors have been advised against developing, the funds have not been supplied to make this happen. Some corporations have seen a fair amount of success from their efforts to contribute to a healthier water supply. The National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation has offered a great deal of aid since its establishment in June 1988. The organisation works to develop dams and dykes, manage flood control, and help with land drainage. They also work for the conservation and sustainability of water throughout the year and the re-use of ground and flood water. Groups operating outside of Kenya have been pitching in as well. Since 1997 the Danish Refugee Council has been providing relief services and contributing to the development of sanitary water systems throughout Kenya and other parts of East Africa. Millions in Kenya have also had water supply systems built by volunteer organisations and self-help groups, usually with funding from donations and support from the Department of Water Development. Still, the country suffers, as do those who share its water sources. Over a dozen countries share basins with Kenya, and at this point there has been no international framework to organise the management of these shared water resources.

Upon the graduation from the department of art history of the Moscow State University in 1981, his first appointment was at the State Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow. He earned a PhD in art history from the Moscow State University in 1989. In 1991 he founded the Research Center for the Eastern Christian Culture, an independent non-governmental organization, and has worked as its director. In 2008‚Äî2009 he served as the vice-president of the Russian Academy of Art. Since 2010 he works at the Institute of World Culture at the Moscow State University as director of the Department of Ancient Culture. Lidov has lectured at Princeton, Harvard, Columbia, Oxford, Cambridge, Sorbonne universities et al. He initiated several research programs and organized nine international symposia on iconographical and hierotopical subjects. Research During his studies at the University of Moscow Lidov specialized in the Byzantine art history. While working as a researcher at the State Museum of Oriental Art, he studied the Christian art of Armenia and Georgia. Building upon the material of his PhD thesis, he published in 1991 his first bookA. Lidov. The Mural Paintings of Akhtala. Moscow, 1991 about the mural paintings of the Akhtala monastery in Armenia. In this book he characterized the art of chalcedonian Armenians as a separate iconographic tradition, which combined Byzantine, Georgian and Armenian elements.A. Lidov. L'art des Armeniens Chalcedoniens. Atti del Quinto Simposio Internazionale di Arte Armena 1988, Venezia 1992, pp.479‚Äì495 Drawing upon the seminal works of A. Grabar, H.Belting, H. Maguire and Chr. Walter, Lidov developed a method of interpretational iconography, which he put into practice in his study of liturgical themes in the Byzantine art and of the symbolism of Heavenly Jerusalem.A.

Moscow ‚Äì Athens, 1999 Later Lidov turned to the study of miracle- working icons and Christian relics, which was quite a new subject in art history. In 2000 he initiated a program of research and cultural activities ‚ÄúChristian relics‚Äù, which included, in particular, two exhibitions and an international conference.

Rome 2006 While studying the role of miraculous icons and relics in the formation of sacred spaces in the Eastern Christian tradition, Lidov has formulated a new concept of hierotopy. The term hierotopy has two meanings. It is the creation of sacred spaces as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field, which spans art history, archaeology, anthropology, and religious studies.A. Lidov. Hierotopy. Spatial Icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture. Moscow, 2009 Hierotopy accounts not only for artistic images and the symbolic world they form, but also for the entire collection of various media that serve to organize a sacred space into a spatial icon.

About some interesting species of Coleophoridae of Turkey and adjacent countries (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae) The larvae feed on Alhagi sparsifolia and possibly other Alhagi species. They live inside the inside stem of their host plant and do not make a case. The larvae are yellow with a chocolate-brown head and a length of around 12 mm. They bore through the pith of the branches of their host plant up to root collar, making a passage of brownish powder. In autumn, the bore is curved and covered in silk. There is a free passage toward the surface of the stem, the outer opening of which is covered with a three-sided valve. Larvae can be found from May to October. Full-fed larvae hibernate in the lower part of the stem in light silky cocoon. Pupation and emergence of adults takes place in early spring, although it might occur as early as midwinter in warm weather.Lepidopterous fauna of the USSR and adjacent countries References machinopis Category:Moths described in 1936 Category:Moths of Asia Category:Moths of Turkey ","title":"Coleophora machinopis"},{"id":"31623341","text":"is a Buddhist temple in Wakabayashi-ku, Sendai, Japan, belonging to the Shingon-sh≈´ Chizan-ha sect, and is the provincial temple (\\"kokubunji\\") of former Mutsu Province. The grounds of the temple are a National Historic Site. and one of its structures, the early Edo period is an Important Cultural Property. Ancient Mutsu Kokubun-ji The Shoku Nihongi records that in 741, as the country recovered from a major smallpox epidemic, Emperor Sh≈çmu ordered that a monastery and nunnery be established in every province, the . In the late Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsury≈ç system, the Yamato court sent a number of military expeditions to what is now the T≈çhoku region of northern Japan to bring the local Emishi tribes under its control. After the establishment of Taga Castle, Yamato forces gradually pushed into the hinterland of what is now Miyagi Prefecture, establishing several fortified settlements along with several large-scale Buddhist temples. The Mutsu Kokubun-ji was located 9.5 kilometers from Taga Castle. The original design of the temple was a walled square area, 240 meters on a side, containing a large South Gate, Middle Gate, Kond≈ç, Lecture Hall, Cloisters, Rectory and a seven-story Pagoda, Ky≈çz≈ç, Sh≈çr≈ç, Kuri, and dormitory. Excavations have revealed that this was one of the largest of the provincial temples. The temple was re-built in the Heian period after the 869 Sanriku earthquake; however, the pagoda was against destroyed in 934 AD, by lightning. Per the Engishiki records of 927 AD, the temple was assigned revenues of 40,000 koku of rice for its upkeep. The temple was again destroyed in 1189, during the campaign of Minamoto no Yoritomo against the Northern Fujiwara. Its subsequent history in the Kamakura period and Muromachi period is somewhat uncertain, although a smaller temple continued to exist on the site. At some point during this period, it converted to the Shingon sect. Following the establishment of Sendai Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate, Masamune Date rebuilt the complex from 1605 on a large scale, but not upon the original foundations. At one point, it was surrounded by 25 subsidiary chapels. However, following the Meiji restoration, most of the temple was destroyed by the government's anti-Buddhism movement, leaving only one chapel at the present-day Yakushi-do, The grounds of the temple were extensively excavated from 1955 to 1959. The excavations revealed that the temple was built from the 740s to 750s, and was located just south of the ruins of a settlement now called the Minami Koizumi ruins. The buildings were all built on foundation stones with tiled roofs and cobblestone floors, with buildings which supported the daily life of the monks having stilt pillars and raised floors. The temple was surrounded by moats and wooden palisades in the manner of a fortress, and was most probably not a place for ordinary people to enter and worship. However, immediately outside the temple enclosure were numerous pit dwellings, presumably for ordinary people who had some connection with the temple. Within the temple enclosure, fragments of melted copper decorations confirmed the records of the destruction of the temple's pagoda in 934 by lightning. It was also found that the Edo Period Ni≈ç-mon gate was built on the foundation of the Nara-period South Gate, and that the Yakushi-d≈ç was built on the foundations of the Nara-period Lecture Hall, indicating that although the temple had fallen almost into complete ruin by the early Edo Period, its location and layout were still known at that time. In the modern period, the ruins were neglected for many decades, with roof tiles being unearthed and taken away by amateur archaeologists and collectors. the site received protection as a National Historic Site in 1922. In 1932, a local historian surveyed the exposed foundation stones and estimated that they were in the correct positions for a Nara period temple. The area was designed a scenic area by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1934. From 1955 to 1959, the site was excavated by T≈çhoku University, and the foundations of all of the main buildings, and numerous previously unknown buildings were uncovered.

In 1903 this structure was designated an Important Cultural Property. The building houses the temple's honzon, a bronze statue of Yakushi Ny≈çrai. The statue is a hibutsu image, and is only display only once a year. It is flanked by wooden Nikk≈ç Bosatsu and Gakk≈ç Bosatsu. An inscription within the Gakko Bosatsu dates it to 1645; however, temple legend states that the statue of Yakushi Ny≈çrai is a surviving image from the original Nara-period temple. The building itself is x 5 x 5 bay hall, with an irimoya-zukuri roof. The building is in the architecture of the Momoyama era, but the exterior is uncolored wood, which is very plain compared to other temples and shrines built by Date Masamune around this time.The interior is divided into two, with the altar having columns painted with gold leaf, sculptured, decorated, and painted in vivid colors in great contrast to the outside of the building.

It is most commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Although it is a low-grade tumor, its location can potentially obstruct the ventricles and lead to hydrocephalus. Signs and symptoms Individuals with this type of tumor may have no symptoms if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow remains open. Obstruction of CSF flow will result in the symptoms associated with increased CSF pressure: nausea, vomiting, headache (often positional), lethargy, blurry or double vision, new or worsened seizures, and personality change. Diagnosis MRI of brain with sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytoma Diagnosis is made by imaging with a contrast-enhanced MRI or CT scan of the brain. Screening It is recommended that children with TSC be screened for SEGA with neuroimaging every 1‚Äì3 years. Treatment=Pharmacotherapy Two related drugs have been shown to shrink or stabilize subependymal giant cell tumors: rapamycin and everolimus. These both belong to the mTOR inhibitor class of immunosuppressants, and are both contraindicated in patients with severe infections. Rapamycin showed efficacy in five cases of SEGA in TSC patients, shrinking their tumor volumes by an average of 65%. However, after the drug was stopped, the tumors regrew. Everolimus, which has a similar structure as rapamycin, but with slightly increased bioavailability and shorter half-life, was studied in 28 patients with SEGA. There was a significant reduction in SEGA size in 75% of the patients, and a mild improvement in their seizures. Everolimus was approved for the treatment of SEGA by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, 2010. Surgery Photograph of a brain section containing a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma A NIH Consensus Conference report in 1999 recommends that any SEGA that is growing or causing symptoms should be surgically removed. Tumors are also removed in cases where a patient is suffering from a high seizure burden. If a tumor is rapidly growing or causing symptoms of hydrocephalus, deferring surgery may lead to vision loss, need for ventricular shunt, and ultimately death. Total removal of the tumor is curative. Surgery to remove intraventricular tumors also carries risks of complications or death. Potential complications include transient memory impairment, hemiparesis, infection, chronic ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, stroke, and death. Prognosis After complete surgical removal, a SEGA tumor does not grow back. They do not metastasize to other parts of the body. However, the patient is still at risk for, and often develops, new tumors arising from subependymal nodules elsewhere in the ventricular system. Epidemiology SEGAs arise in 5-20% of TSC patients.

The first church was built in 4th century. The current cathedral was constructed in 6th-7th century. The cathedral went through a huge restoration in 1002. The temple has rather unique design. It is a tetraconch, rather common for the churches of 6th-7th centuries, but unusually inserted into an octagon. Later alterations partly mask the original plan.  History  According to The Georgian Chronicles, Byzantine Imperor Constantine gifted Georgian priests parts of the True Cross. Bishop Ioanne arrived to Manglisi, started construction of a church and left part of wood there. Thus, the first church in Manglisi may appear already in the 4th century, thus making it one of the first Christian churches in Georgia. The second reference in the chronicles is connected with the time of Vakhtang Gorgasali, when the king sent a bishop to Manglisi (6th century). In the reign of Stepanoz I (7th century), Greeks took the True Cross back to Constantinopolis. Its final appearance the cathedral received during the reign of George II in the 11th century. The walls around the church with towers were built by bishop Arseni in 17th century. A writing above the gate, carved in the rock, mentions this. The church documents mention 15 bishops, starting from the time of Tamar in 12th-13th century, till arrival of Russians in early 19th century.

He played for the United States men's national basketball team at the 1963 FIBA World Championship, 1963 Pan American Games and 1964 Summer Olympics, winning a gold medal at the latter two competitions. Shipp was also a three-time Amateur Athletic Union All-American for the Phillips 66ers in Bartlesville, Oklahoma during the 1960s. Early life Shipp was born in Shreveport, Louisiana on September 27, 1935. He was raised in Blue, Oklahoma, however, and attended Blue High School. Basketball career=College Shipp enrolled at Southeastern State College (now called Southeastern Oklahoma State University) in the fall of 1955. He played for the Savage Storm for four years, from 1955‚Äì56 through 1958‚Äì59, and he is recognized as \\"one of the greatest basketball players in the history of [Southeastern Oklahoma State University]\\". Shipp led the conference in scoring twice, was a three-time all-conference performer, and set two different conference records: points in a game (54) and most free throws made without a miss (19). In 1978 he was inducted into the school's hall of fame, and in 2007, Shipp was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. Amateur Athletic Union After graduation, Shipp was selected in the 1959 NBA Draft by the New York Knickerbockers. He was taken in the 9th round as the 64th overall pick. Shipp, however, opted to play in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) instead in order to retain his \\"amateur\\" status. Back then, only amateurs were allowed to compete in international competition while representing their country, such as the Pan American, FIBA World Championship and Summer Olympic Games. During the next five years, Shipp played for the AAU powerhouse Phillips 66ers. He played in three consecutive national championships with them between 1962 and 1964, winning the title the first two times. During these three seasons he was also named an AAU All-American. Shipp finished his career at the highest scoring non-center in Phillips 66ers history (Bob Kurland, a center, was the team's all-time leading scorer). Team USA Representing the United States, Shipp won two gold medals in less than two years while playing for the basketball team. At the 1963 Pan American Games in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, the U.S. swept the competition en route to a perfect 6‚Äì0 record. He averaged 15.0 points per game, the highest on the team, while making 42 field goals and six free throws. On the 1963 FIBA World Championship team, the U.S. cruised out of the preliminary round with a 3‚Äì0 record. They stumbled in the final round, however, going 3‚Äì3 (6‚Äì3 overall) and did not win a medal, finishing in fourth place. Shipp led the team in scoring at 15.7 points per game in nine games played. At the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, Shipp played alongside future Hall of Famers Bill Bradley and Larry Brown, as well as veritable basketball stars Walt Hazzard, Jeff Mullins and Joe Caldwell. It was Shipp, however, that led the team in scoring. He guided Team USA to an unblemished 9‚Äì0 record while averaging 12.4 points per game‚Äî2.3 more per game than Bradley, who was second on the team in scoring. In a 69‚Äì61 win over Yugoslavia during the Group Stage, Shipp scored a personal tournament-high 22 points and accounted for nearly one-third of the team's total offense. In the championship game against the Soviet Union, who also entered the contest with an 8‚Äì0 record like the United States, he scored 10 points in the 73‚Äì59 win to earn the gold medal. Later life Toward the end of 1964, fresh off two AAU national championships, three AAU All-American honors, and two gold medals with Team USA, Shipp was nominated as a finalist for the James E. Sullivan Award. It is an award given annually by the AAU to \\"the outstanding amateur athlete in the United States\\". He spent the rest of his life in business, much of it with ConocoPhillips. Shipp was inducted into the Helms Athletic Foundation and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Halls of Fame.

Its headquarters are in Zaandam.Top 500, Top500.de History Originally, Eurometaal is an industrial military complex that set up camp in Zaandam around 1900, and adopted the name Eurometaal in 1973. Eurometaal has developed weaponry for the Royal Netherlands Army from NR20 C1 hand grenades to tanks. In the nineties, an employee of the hand grenade factory in Liebenau revealed that their grenades were used in the Kurdish-Turkish conflict, which created a PR nightmare and led to the shutdown of the factory in Germany in 1993. The arms created in Germany had transited through the Netherlands before being delivered to Turkey, amid a German ban on arm trades with Turkey. Eurometaal was a producer M864 and M483A1 projectiles. It also had the licence to produce American DPICMs that it was producing both in Zaandam (since 1989) and in Turkey through a partnership with MKEK (since 1994). This production stopped in 2002. Following the European defense conversion program, Eurometaal successfully diversified its activities to gear to civilians, by laying off hundreds of employees and acquiring existing civil companies. In 1999, Rheinmetall increased its stake in Eurometaal to 66%. In 2002, Rheinmetall sold Eurometaal's subsidiary Intergas (manufacturer of furnaces and boilers) and closed Eurometaal altogether.

The spring on the left pulls on the binding clamps on the right (silver), forcing them towards the center of the binding. The binding plate, screwed to the bottom of the boot, is held in place by these clamps. A plate has been inserted in the upper binding for illustration purposes. Spademan was a type of ski binding, one of a number of \\"plate bindings\\" that were popular in alpine skiing during the 1970s. It used a bronze plate screwed into the bottom of the boot as its connection point, held to the ski by a clamp-like mechanism that grasped the side of the plate. Unlike conventional bindings, the Spademan could release in any direction, in response to any force or torque. It provided greatly improved protection compared to contemporary designs, which generally allowed release of the toe to the sides and heel directly forward, keeping the foot attached in any other fall direction. The Spademan system became very popular in the late 1970s. Production mis-steps right when new toe-and-heel bindings were being introduced led to a death spiral, and the Spademan system disappeared in the early 1980s. However, the fact that it used a single mounting plate eliminated adjustments for different sized boots, which made it popular in rental shops for some time. The Look Integral was introduced to fill this niche when Spademan exited the market. History In 1962, Dr. Richard Spademan took a job at the Tahoe Forest Hospital in Truckee, California. This was just after the 1960 Winter Olympics at the Squaw Valley Ski Resort, and traffic on the hill had increased as a result. In the early 1960s there were a number of quick-release binding systems on the market, but most of them required the user to bolt fittings to the toe and heel. Improperly assembled, or adjusted, these systems failed to release consistently. Spademan would later remark \\"Bindings were trash. We saw 150 fractures in a three-day weekend.\\" Studying the problem, Spademan found three problems; bindings didn't release in the directions that caused problems, they didn't release under straight-line deceleration, and the adjustments were too complex. In particular, he noted that any forward fall, even to the sides, would jam the boot into the toe clips. This meant that a forward twisting fall would work against the fundamental action of the binding. Spademan desired a binding that had no toe piece, allowing the boot to slide forward unimpeded. His first attempt to solve these problems clipped to the sides of a plate at the heel, with no toe clip at all.3140887 However, this allowed the toe to move about too much, so a new toe clip was added to address this. He then noticed that the key to reducing injury would be to mount the ski over the tibial axis of the leg, below the calf. This would reduce torque on the knee and ankle when the ski rotated under the boot. This led to a new design with the binding mounted under the boot, and from there to the final Spademan design. Conventional bindings clamped onto the flange at the toe and heel of the boot, which were moulded into a roughly rectangular shape. The release action was controlled by cams in the binding, whose limited size limited the cams's size and travel. In the case of the Spademan, the boot plate itself was the cam surface, which gave the designers much more room to work with. Release directions could be adjusted simply by changing the shape of the plate, allowing the binding to release in any direction. This made the Spademan design dramatically safer than conventional systems; rental shops reported 1 fracture per 50,000 ski days with the Spademan, when the average was 1 in 20,000 (these numbers have since improved dramatically). Additionally, the limited size of the cams in contemporary bindings (with the notable exception of the Look Nevada) had relatively limited free travel to soak up short shocks. This led to the problem of \\"pre-release\\", where a binding would release due to momentary pressure that would only cause injury if it was maintained for a longer time (it is not necessarily the force that fractures a bone, but the actual movement). In the case of the late model S series, the binding could move as much as 30 mm before releasing. During his residency at Stanford University, Spademan had designed a new type of inter-vascular catheter. By the mid-1960s this was in production and increasingly widespread use. He used the royalties from the catheter to start prototype production of his binding. Driving to every ski resort in range with a few hundred pairs of bindings, he finally convinced some ski patrollers at Squaw Valley and Boyne Mountain to try them out. Most broke immediately. This led to further design improvements, and eventually to a 1969 production run of 1000 pairs of bindings from the newly formed Spademan Release Systems, Inc. Continual improvements followed to allow the binding to hold more strongly, and by the winter of 1974/75 the binding was a must-have on the pro freestyle skiing circuit. Richard Whitaker and David Stuart then introduced a key improvement to the system. Early versions of the Spademan required the skier to clamp the binding onto the plate by tightening the spring with the rotating nut. Whitaker and Stuart suggesting having the spring on an arm that rotated upward, positioned over a cam at the rear of the binding. When the arm was rotated up, it would slide off the top of the cam and release all the tension. It could then be re-tensioned onto the plate by pushing the spring back down onto the cam. Spademan later further improved on this design, adding a latch to keep the clamp arms open. In use, the skier would remove the binding as normal by lifting the spring off the cam, but could then return it immediately to the \\"clamped\\" position. The latch kept the clamps open until a small button under the binding plate was depressed, which happened when the skier stepped back into the binding. This gave the Spademan \\"step in\\" performance, which previous models lacked. The Spademan S9 binding, one of very few produced. The basic concept is the same as earlier models, but the spring tension is now released by pressing down on the large lever on top of the binding. This is typically done with the ski pole, eliminating the need to bend over to step out. The S9 also added a ski brake, which by that time was a standard feature of all downhill bindings. The widespread introduction of plastic boots in the 1970s changed the market considerably. Now the required attachment points for toe-and-heel bindings could be moulded right into the boot, eliminating the problems when users screwed on their own attachments. These entered a market in the 1970s where plate-type bindings, including Spademan, held roughly half the binding market. In 1978 Spademan had excellent sales and was by far the best selling US binding design. A dramatically improved model was being introduced for the winter, the S-2/S-3/S-4 lineup, that greatly increased \\"free travel\\" within the binding in order to prevent pre-release. Betting on large sales, Spademan moved the factory from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe. The bindings were made of cast aluminum, and the moulds were delivered months late. Both of these changes conspired to slow production, and many shops did not receive stock until well into the season. Sales plummeted, and the rapid take up of toe-and- heel bindings for the now universal plastic boots meant they never recovered. The S-9 model introduced true step-in-step out performance, but by the time of its release sales were moribund. Spademan eventually returned to practicing medicine. Rapid standardization among boot vendors meant that bindings manufacturers had a known flange to clip onto, and through the late 1970s conventional toe-and-heel bindings dramatically improved. Users could buy any model of boot and use it with any model of binding, whereas with the Spademan the boot had to be \\"prepared\\", if it could be. It was not uncommon for boots to have cut down areas under the midsole, so there was not enough room for the plate to be mounted. Even if the plate fit, boots were not generally designed for mounting under the midstep, and it was not uncommon for the Spademan plate to pull out of the sole. Even then, the addition of the plate might render the boot unusable on a ski with traditional bindings. This led to the introduction of the Spademan 900 boot, but it was withdrawn after only a year. The Spademan had a number of operational disadvantages as well. As there was no space below the binding plate, even small amounts of snow clinging to the bottom of the boot could make it difficult to fasten properly. A very thin film of snow was even worse; it was possible to close the binding with the plate slightly above its normal rest position, which pre-tensioned the clips and made it much easier to release unexpectedly. The plate itself was also quite slippery (the reason bronze was used) which made walking somewhat difficult and also wore down relatively quickly. Removing the binding also required it to be reset, so the system was much less automatic than contemporary designs like the Salomon 727. The Spademan system retained one major advantage over the toe-and-heel binding, due to the universal plate. When changing boots, normally one would have to adjust the bindings fore-and-aft to accommodate a change in boot length, but with the Spademan this was not an issue because the plate was always the same size and shape. This made them popular in rental shops, where they lived on into the mid-1980s. The company also sold clip-on full-length plates for people who wanted to use rental skis with Spademan bindings with their own boots, lacking the butterfly. The plate had metal loops that clipped over the toe and heel, with a small lever on the back to allow it to be tensioned onto the boot, and a well-fastened butterfly on the bottom. Description :For images, see US Patent 4360219 The Spademan system consisted of a single hollow binding that sat on the ski under the middle of the boot. In the middle of the hollow were two bronze clips that were pivoted near the rear of the binding, so that rotation around the pivot point moved the clips sideways towards the middle of the binding. An T-shaped arm ran between the clips to cam-shaped indentations on the clips. When the arm was pulled rearwards, it pulled on the cams and rotated the clips inward. The arm was attached to a spring at the rear of the binding that provided constant rearward tension, pulling the cams, and holding the clips in the closed position. On the bottom of the boot was a bronze plate shaped like a butterfly or hourglass. When the clamps were tensioned onto the plate, bumps on the clamps fell into indentations on the sides of the plates, positioning and rotating them correctly. Bronze was used to prevent metal-on-metal lockup in the wet conditions they faced.4360219 To fasten the binding, the spring assembly was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised slightly it could move forward, releasing all tension on the clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a safety strap. The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the spring assembly was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the spring assembly that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour. Automatic release was accomplished by forcing the clips sideways, against the tension of the spring. The shape of the clip and the plates meant that rotating the boot in relation to the ski would force them outwards. For instance, in a twisting motion the plate would push the clip sideways along the edge of the plate until it reached the corner, when it would release. In a direct-forward fall, the plate would lift up, acting against the angled shape of the clips, again forcing them outward and eventually releasing. The tension could be adjusted for skier weight or skill level via a large screw knob at the extreme rear, and several springs were provided for different release forces.

He died fighting in the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War. Education and family St John was the son of Oliver St John, 1st Earl of Bolingbroke and his wife Elizabeth Paulet, daughter of William Paulet. He was baptised on 2 April 1603. St John was admitted a fellow commoner of Queens' College, Cambridge on 3 November 1615, and was presumably the Oliver St John granted a passport to travel to Europe in June 1617. He matriculated at Queens' in 1618 and was awarded an MA in 1620. In 1623, St John married Arabella Egerton, daughter of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater, by whom he had four daughters: *1. Frances St John married Sir William Beecher of Howberry. *2. Elizabeth St John married George Bennett of Cotsback *3. Arabella St John married Sir Edward Wyse of Sydenham *4. Dorothy St John married Francis Charlton of Apley Castle, Shropshire.Burke's Landed Gentry of Great Britain & Ireland (1847) under Charlton of Apley Castle In the Commons In February 1624, his father arranged his return to Parliament as knight of the shire for Bedfordshire, replacing Oliver's uncle Sir Beauchamp St John. St John's father owned large estates there and dominated the representation of the county; Oliver was returned alongside his father's first cousin, Sir Oliver Luke, who was likewise supported by the family interest. On 27 April, St John certified to the House that there were no recusants holding office in his county, but does not otherwise appear in Parliamentary records. After his father was created Earl of Bolingbroke on 28 December, St John adopted the courtesy title of Lord St John of Bletsoe. Re- elected for Bedfordshire in 1625, he was more active in that Parliament, serving on several legislative committees. He was appointed a justice of the peace for Bedford, Bedfordshire, and Hertfordshire that year. St John was again returned for Bedfordshire in January 1626, to the 2nd Parliament of King Charles I. On 1 February 1626, he was created a Knight of the Bath at Charles' coronation, shortly before Parliament assembled. In that Parliament, he was appointed to the Committee of Privileges, and also to the committee that punished Sir Thomas Hartopp, High Sheriff of Leicestershire, for interfering in his county's election. However, his Parliamentary activity centered on committees dealing with various aspects of the war with Spain, and he was an open critic of the Duke of Buckingham's conduct. That Parliament was dissolved on 15 June after framing a remonstrance against Buckingham, being unwilling to grant a supply to the King until the Duke was removed. Immediately after the dissolution, St John and others possessing copies of the remonstrance were ordered to surrender them for destruction, by Royal command, although a copy survives in his family's papers; and through the agency of the Duke, Luke and the St Johns were removed from the commissions of the peace. In the interval between Parliaments, St John was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 9 August 1627. He was returned to the House of Commons for the last time in February 1628, to the 3rd parliament of King Charles I. Surprisingly, despite the ongoing struggle between his family and the King (Sir Oliver Luke, Sir Beauchamp St John, and Bolingbroke had all refused to pay the forced loan of the previous year), St John had only a minor role in the assembly of the Petition of Right. He was again appointed to the committee of privileges, but engaged in little other Parliamentary business. He and his relatives were re-appointed to their commissions of the peace in December 1628, shortly after the murder of Buckingham. His inactivity in Parliament during 1629 may have reciprocated this pacific gesture, but continued to adhere to the popular party in the Commons, and applied for a license to visit the Parliamentary leader Sir John Eliot in the Tower of London, where Eliot was imprisoned after the dissolution of Parliament. Debts and death During the 1630s, he took part in his father's efforts to drain the Great Level, serving as a commissioner of sewers there from 1631 to 1636 or later, but was largely occupied in dealing with his own accumulation of debts. The figure of ¬£60,000 for his debts was given in a petition to the House of Commons in 1641; an enormous sum, if truthfully reported, for an heir apparent with a negligible estate of his own to offer as security. Two earlier petitions recited liabilities on his part of ¬£6,900, still very significant, and he was also prosecuted as a surety for the debts of Sir Thomas Cheney, his uncle by marriage. As Clarendon avers, his debts did cause havoc for his sureties: some of the possessions of his uncle Sir Alexander St John were distrained by Lord St John's creditors, and Sir Capell Bedell, another surety, made a composition with Lord Bolingbroke to pay some of the debts to avoid the same fate. On 21 November 1638, he obtained a passport to travel for three years under the alias of \\"St John Thompson\\", but the deception was discovered, and he was arrested under a warrant from Sir Francis Windebank on 21 December while lying ill at Rye. However, he was released or allowed to proceed, and spent the next two years in exile on the continent. From abroad, he petitioned for immunity from prosecution for debt, which was effectively granted when he was summoned to the House of Lords by writ of acceleration as Baron St John of Bletso, entering the House on 14 May 1641. His writ was said by Clarendon to have been granted with the object of composing his debts and reducing the turmoil among his sureties in Bedfordshire, and obtaining an adherent of the Royal party in the Lords; but St John showed no attachment to the King's cause. Indeed, he seems to have been largely preoccupied in defending himself from his creditors. When the English Civil War broke out, he raised, presumably on his father's credit, a troop of horse and a regiment of foot for Parliament, in which Oliver Cromwell's eldest son, Oliver, served as cornet. Early in October 1642 he occupied Hereford on behalf of Parliament, fortified the town, and refused admittance to King Charles when he appeared there on 8 October. He then joined the army of the Earl of Essex. He was wounded at the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642, captured by the Royalists, and according to Clarendon, died the next morning.

The exterior was in the Palladian style, the interior Baroque. It was demolished in 1937 and on its site now stands an eponymous block of flats. It stood in Mayfair on the north side of Curzon Street, between South Audley Street and what is now Chesterfield Street. The French travel writer Pierre- Jean Grosley in his 1770 book Londres (translated as Tour to London) considered the house to be equal to the hotel particuliers of the nobility in Paris.

It is assumed he meant Richard Howe by Isaac Ware. In his \\"Letters to his Son\\", Chesterfield wrote from \\"Hotel Chesterfield\\" on 31 March 1749: \\"I have yet finished nothing but my boudoir and my library; the former is the gayest and most cheerful room in England; the latter the best. My garden is now turfed, planted and sown, and will in two months more make a scene of verdure and flowers not common in London.\\" Library The Quarterly Review (founded 1809), no. 125, reported: Staircase Cannons, Edgware The columns of the screen facing the courtyard and the marble staircase with bronze balustrade came from Cannons, near Edgware, the mansion of James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos (d.1744) which was demolished shortly after his death, the materials being sold at auction in 1747. Chesterfield also bought at the auction the portico and railings. Chesterfield also furnished his new mansion with artefacts from the sale at Houghton Hall, the country house of Robert Walpole, including an 18-candle copper-gilt lantern. The library was hung with portraits of the earl's ancestors. As a piece of satire concerning the fashion for boasts of ancient ancestry, he placed amongst these portraits two old portraits which he inscribed \\"Adam de Stanhope\\" and \\"Eve de Stanhope\\". Creation of Stanhope St Chesterfield formed Stanhope Street on adjoining land purchased from the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.

While total correlation is bounded by the sum entropies of the n elements, the dual total correlation is bounded by the joint-entropy of the n elements. Although well behaved, dual total correlation has received much less attention than the total correlation. A measure known as \\"TSE- complexity\\" defines a continuum between the total correlation and dual total correlation (Ay 2001). Definition Venn diagram of information theoretic measures for three variables x, y, and z. The dual total correlation is represented by the union of the three mutual informations and is shown in the diagram by the yellow, magenta, cyan, and gray regions. For a set of n random variables {X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n}, the dual total correlation D(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) is given by : D(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) = H\\\\left( X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n \\\\right) - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H\\\\left( X_i \\\\mid X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, X_n \\\\right) , where H(X_{1},\\\\ldots,X_{n}) is the joint entropy of the variable set {X_{1},\\\\ldots,X_{n}} and H(X_i \\\\mid \\\\cdots ) is the conditional entropy of variable X_{i}, given the rest. Normalized The dual total correlation normalized between [0,1] is simply the dual total correlation divided by its maximum value H(X_{1}, \\\\ldots, X_{n}), :ND(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) = \\\\frac{D(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)}{H(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)} .

Secondly, Dual total correlation has a close relationship with total correlation, C(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n). In particular, : \\\\frac{C(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n)}{n-1} \\\\leq D(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) \\\\leq (n-1) \\\\; C(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) . Relation to other quantities In measure theoretic terms, by the definition of dual total correlation: : D(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) = \\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_i \\\\tilde{X}_i \\\\setminus \\\\left(\\\\bigcup_j \\\\tilde{X}_j \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{k eq j} \\\\tilde{X}_k) \\\\right)\\\\right) which is equal to the union of the pairwise mutual informations: : D(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) = \\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{i}\\\\bigcup_{j eq i} \\\\left(\\\\tilde{X}_i\\\\cap\\\\tilde{X}_j\\\\right)\\\\right) History Han (1978) originally defined the dual total correlation as, : \\\\begin{align} & D(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) [10pt] \\\\equiv {} & \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, X_n ) \\\\right] - (n-1) \\\\; H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) \\\\; . \\\\end{align} However Abdallah and Plumbley (2010) showed its equivalence to the easier-to-understand form of the joint entropy minus the sum of conditional entropies via the following: : \\\\begin{align} & D(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) [10pt] \\\\equiv {} & \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, X_n ) \\\\right] - (n-1) \\\\; H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) \\\\ = {} & \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, X_n ) \\\\right] + (1-n) \\\\; H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) \\\\ = {} & H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) + \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, X_n ) - H(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n) \\\\right] \\\\ = {} & H\\\\left( X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n \\\\right) - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H\\\\left( X_i \\\\mid X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, X_n \\\\right)\\\\; . \\\\end{align} See also *Mutual information *Total correlation References * Han T.

It was released on February 16, 2011. Ocean was inspired to make the mixtape after Hurricane Katrina in his native New Orleans and his subsequent relocation to Los Angeles. After joining alternative hip hop group Odd Future in 2010, he self-released the mixtape, without initial promotion. Nostalgia, Ultra has a unique R&B; aesthetic and features surreal themes and nostalgic lyrics. The songs mostly focus on interpersonal relationships, personal reflection, and social commentary. Following its release, the mixtape received rave reviews from music critics. The cover features a picture of a bright orange BMW E30 M3, Ocean's \\"dream car\\", in plain sight amidst lush greenery. In May 2011, Def Jam announced its plans to release the mixtape as an EP on July 26, 2011. However, the release of the EP was indefinitely delayed in July 2011 and has since been cancelled. Two singles were released from the aborted EP version: \\"Novacane\\", and \\"Swim Good\\". Both songs received music videos directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin. Ocean embarked on a solo concert tour through North America and Europe to promote the record, playing a total of 7 shows. In addition, his 2012 performance at the Coachella Music Festival included several live renditions from the release including \\"Strawberry Swing\\" and \\"Lovecrimes\\". The mixtape appeared on several music critics' and publications' end-of-year albums lists. Controversy arose in March 2012 over the song \\"American Wedding\\", a remake of the song \\"Hotel California\\" by American rock band Eagles. Recording artist Kanye West was reportedly a fan of the mixtape, which led to Ocean appearing on the album Watch the Throne. Subsequently, Ocean collaborated with artists Beyonc√© Knowles and Jay-Z after they were introduced to the mixtape through West. Following its release, both Ocean and the mixtape have developed a cult following. The mixtape was followed by the release of Ocean's debut studio album Channel Orange to even greater critical acclaim in 2012. Background Ocean was forced to move to Los Angeles after Hurricane Katrina. Frank Ocean was born in Long Beach, California. When he was at the age of 10, his family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. He made the decision to pursue a career in music at a young age, and as a teen, he did neighborhood chores to fund his early studio sessions. After Hurricane Katrina hit his hometown of New Orleans, Ocean moved to Los Angeles to pursue a recording career. He initially had problems maintaining a career while juggling a job, due to spending too much time in the recording studios, making him late for his jobs. He began to write songs and he sold them to other recording artists; selling his first song to Noel Gourdin at the age of 19. Discussing as to why he chose to write songs, Ocean commented that \\"I feel at a higher level of consciousness when I'm being creative.\\" Eventually, he landed songwriting gigs for established artists like Brandy, John Legend, and Justin Bieber where he made substantially more money. In late 2009, he met producer Tricky Stewart, who helped Ocean sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as a solo artist. However, he was initially unable to build a relationship with the company. In protest, Ocean joined the rap collective Odd Future which introduced him to artists such as Tyler, The Creator and Hodgy Beats. His debut song was \\"SteamRoller\\" on the Domo Genesis album Rolling Papers. Ocean garnered acclaim and generated interest while in the group, and Rolling Stone magazine's Jonah Weiner called him a \\"gifted avant-R&B; smoothie\\". During his time with the group he recorded and self- released Nostalgia, Ultra without any pre-release promotion on his Tumblr account. Music and lyrics The mixtape samples songs from Radiohead, Coldplay, MGMT, Mr. Hudson and The Eagles, which Ocean sings over. Ocean, when uploading the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked about why he uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; \\"I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag.\\" Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that \\"It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [or] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels to do it at the level, the quality of records I wanted to make‚Ä¶ But, it was a process I appreciate so much.\\" In his own words, Ocean calls the album \\"nostalgic.\\" He explains, \\"it's a longing for the past. That's what this record felt like.\\" The lyrical content, according to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: \\"I wasn't trying to make a record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are.\\" Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, \\"you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me.\\" When asked by The Quietus if the songs from the album drew from his personal experiences, Frank commented \\"My kitchen is usually pretty clean, you know. But you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that everything has to be... Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has to be like a fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, and a little bit of satire.\\" When asked if he made R&B; music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, \\"if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R&B; artist. Period.\\" Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R&B; influences, but that it is not an R&B; album entirely. Songs The album begins with a melodic cover of \\"Strawberry Swing\\" by English alternative rock band Coldplay. Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News writes that the cover begins the album with \\"so much atmosphere you almost melt into it\\" and then \\"spreads you over an apocalyptic swan song\\". The song ends abruptly with the rude sound of an alarm clock, followed by the \\"nightmarish\\" song \\"Novacane\\".Pitchfork Staff (December 15, 2011). The Top 50 Albums of 2011, Page 4.

Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl \\"so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, has no choice but to get gone on those same drugs\\". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator. Several interludes are placed throughout the album, named after video games, such as Street Fighter, Metal Gear Solid, GoldenEye 007 and Soulcalibur. This is reported to give the album a more nostalgic feel; the record is \\"held together by tiny interludes named after 1990s video games in which the unmistakable sounds of a cassette player rewinding, fast-forwarding, and stopping are heard\\". On the track \\"We All Try\\", Ocean speaks out against homophobia. According to The Guardian, \\"Odd Future's frequent use of the word 'faggot' unsettled liberal stomachs\\", and that \\"Ocean was brave enough to stand alone once more, declaring on 'We All Try': 'I believe that marriage isn't between a man and woman, but between love and love'. On the same song he reveals his opinion of the pro-choice debate: 'I believe a woman's temple, gives her the right to choose/ But baby don't abort.'\\" He obliquely \\"announces his support of a woman's right to choose and gay marriage\\", both of which are \\"hardly typical r&b; tropes.\\" Pitchfork Media wrote that \\"in a skit called \\"Bitches Talkin\\", the ladies tell him to cut it out with the damn Radiohead, while \\"Optimistic\\" is playing in the background; in 'Songs For Women', he obliges‚Äîhe's an indie kid when it comes to alienation but a pragmatist when it comes to sex.\\" \\"Songs For Women\\" is a song where Ocean can't decide whether to rue or revel in his conflicted feelings about women. The song offers a self- effacing perspective, with a numbed, restrained delivery. Lyrically the track expresses a narrative where he tries to arrange an after-school meeting in his dad's empty house and brags about harmonizing to Otis, Isley and Marvin. He laments that his woman doesn't listen to him or his music: \\"It's like she never heard of me.\\" In spite of the \\"suave delivery and the song's inherent tunefulness\\", the object of Ocean's affection soon ditches his love songs in favor of those sung \\"by real R&B; big-shots (Drake included)\\". The mixtape also contains several references to American director Stanley Kubrick and his films, most notably Eyes Wide Shut. Nicole Kidman's adulterous soliloquy from the film can be heard during the song \\"Lovecrimes\\", adding a sense of manic dread.\\" The film is also referenced on the track \\"Novacane\\", where Ocean also sings that he's \\"feelin like Stanley Kubrick\\". Following that is the track \\"There Will Be Tears\\". The song has been described as emotional in nature, containing a glitchy beat sampled from Mr Hudson, with heavily synthesised vocals. \\"There Will Be Tears\\" has a thundering bass flat over a hyperactive 808 beat. Ocean sings about not having a father; \\"Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying / Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither / And they weren't crying\\", where he \\"lets his guard down completely.\\" \\"Swim Good\\" has been called an \\"astonishing suicide song\\" and that Ocean finds himself dressed in black ('Like I'm ready for a funeral'), tormented by heartbreak and on the verge of driving his car into the sea.Jonze, Tim (December 14, 2011). Best albums of 2011, No 3: Frank Ocean ‚Äì Nostalgia, Ultra. The Guardian. Retrieved on 2011-11-123. The song is a grim escape fantasy describing a murder suicide, which \\"has the singer driving his car to the shore, his trunk 'bleeding' with 'broken hearts'.\\" The hook of the song ends with the refrain of \\"I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby.\\" \\"Dust\\" uses books as an extended metaphor for memories and experience, with lines like \\"so many pages I wrote, wish I could revise 'em / But there's no erasing\\". The penultimate track is \\"American Wedding\\", a 7-minute remake of \\"Hotel California\\" by American rock band Eagles. The track expresses an extended tale of a shotgun marriage and subsequent divorce. It's here that we \\"might get a little peek into the psychology of the man shirking the foremost genre for love songs: He doesn't believe in love. At least not in the United States.\\" The song has a \\"totally unexpected ending for a song told as a flashback.\\" The album ends with \\"Nature Feels\\", a reinterpretation of MGMT's \\"Electric Feel\\". The song exhibits Ocean as an \\"openly fun character\\", opening the song with the line \\"I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden.\\" According to Pitchfork, no matter the mood, Ocean is always \\"quick to add fine particulars that make his songs his songs\\". Pitchfork called \\"Nature Feel\\" an \\"MGMT-sampling Garden of Eden fuck ode\\". Critical reception Nostalgia, Ultra received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the mixtape received an average score of 83, based on nine reviews. Anupa Mistry from Exclaim! called it \\"sophisticated\\", \\"pulsing and expansive\\", and wrote that Ocean's \\"alt sensibilities\\" prove \\"musically intuitive\\" AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that Ocean's uniqueness lies in his \\"wistful, often self-effacing perspective and numbed, restrained delivery\\" rather than his production choices, which he found \\"neither exceptional nor particularly left of center\\". Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club called the mixtape \\"dark, playful, a little tasteless, and absolutely riveting\\". Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News wrote that, \\"by funneling [the primary means of R&B; decadence] through his diverse and diverging palette, Ocean literalizes both his nostalgic impulses and the odd future of which he is a part.\\" The Village Voices Sean Fennessey called him \\"an intuitive r&b; stylist, with a firm sense of song structure.\\" Rudy K. of Sputnikmusic felt that the mixtape sounds \\"so fresh, so real\\" for a member from Odd Future and stated, \\"With Ocean, it never sounds contrived.\\" In his review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau described Ocean's \\"romantic laments\\" as \\"models of texture, respect, and profound loss, their beats subtle, seductive, weird, and seized like time whether he's deploying 'songs for women' that are soon trumped by Drake's, not feeling a porn-moonlighting dental student and her 'novacaine,' or annulling a courthouse wedding solemnized just before his bride turned in her term paper on hijab.\\" Pitchforks Ryan Dombal commented that \\"There are distinct elements of Drake's melancholic paranoia and The-Dream's high melodrama, too. But there's also a heady surreality surrounding Nostalgia, Ultra that makes it unique.\\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it \\"slick and intuitive ... full of astral soul that owes debts to Terence Trent D'Arby, Pharrell Williams, even Drake\\", adding that \\"[Ocean] sings casually but precisely, stretching out syllables as if he's forgetting to let them go.\\"Caramanica, Jon (March 21, 2011).

No Ripcord's Charlie Jebb wrote that \\"Nostalgia, Ultra has more than enough good stuff to establish Ocean as an artist to watch,\\" calling it \\"[an] R&B; record with crossover potential without sacrificing soul that creates a complete picture of its author, warts and all.\\"Jebb, Charlie (March 21, 2011).

Planned reissue On May 19, 2011, Ocean's record label Def Jam announced its plans to release an EP containing tracks from nostalgia, ULTRA. Ocean announced that the re-release would have been titled Nostalgia, Lite and that it was expected to feature seven tracks. The EP was originally scheduled to be released on July 26, 2011, however, Ocean noted on his official Tumblr page on July 24, 2011 that Nostalgia, Lite would no longer be released on July 26 and that the project was cancelled. Both \\"Swim Good\\" and \\"Novacane\\" were set to be featured on the release. Talking about which other songs would make it onto the reissue, Ocean commented that \\"The Eagles sample 'American Wedding' has no chance in hell of being cleared\\". He continued, \\"Coldplay sample 'Strawberry Swing', possibly. I hear 'possibly' from people who say they know. MGMT, those guys seem chill. I heard they heard the record 'Nature Feels' and they liked it a lot, so hopefully that can go someway.\\" Other tracks on the reissue were set to be \\"Acura Integurl\\", which appeared on the unofficial release The Lonny Breaux Collection, and \\"Whip Appeal\\" which was released in 2012. In 2012, Ocean commented again on his blog that \\"Nostalgia Lite is \\"never coming out.\\" Singles \\"Novacane\\" was officially released as the first single from Nostalgia, Ultra on May 31, 2011. \\"Novacane\\" first charted on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs on May 11, 2011 at number 65. The subsequent week, it rose to number 58, and on its third week, the single rose to number 52. In its fourth week, it rose to number 17. The music video for \\"Novacane\\" was released on June 16, directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin. When discussing the video, Ocean commented \\"I was just trying to connect or articulate visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic and a little bit of special effects.\\" The song also charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at position 82 and at 6 on the Billboard Heatseekers Songs. \\"Swim Good\\" was released as the second single from the mixtape on October 18, 2011, and the song charted at position 70 on the Billboard R&B; chart for three weeks.

During Odd Future 2012's tour promoting The Odd Future Tape Vol. 2, Frank performed with the group. Tour Ocean performing at Coachella in 2012 Ocean embarked on a six-date concert tour from November 5 to November 15, 2011, through North America and Europe to promote both the mixtape and his other musical projects. Originally, six shows were scheduled with a New York City performance at the Bowery Ballroom on the 6th. The original date for that show was postponed to the 27th, and that an additional show on the 28th had been added. The reported reason was because Ocean was sick. The performances featured no opening act, and the only performer on stage at any given time was Ocean. Rolling Stone reviewed the debut show, calling Ocean awkward at times, though they stated that \\"fortunately his dispassionately told stories of love and loss in a world that assumes impermanence could handle the load of the audience.\\" MTV commented that it took Ocean \\"some time to warm up to the crowd\\" at his debut New Orleans performance, though they noted the performance started the tour to a \\"promising start\\". MTV later reviewed the New York performance on the 27th and called Ocean \\"an audience charmer\\". The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica gave a positive review to the same New York performance, calling Ocean a \\"versatile singer\\" and writing that \\"in his elegant, savvy, slightly crooked postsoul, he shifts sneakily between the two topics, singing about love as a byproduct of music and using the subject of music to dig deep about love.\\" The set lists to the various shows varied, though singles \\"Swim Good\\" and \\"Novacane\\" were performed at all shows. Others tracks like \\"LoveCrimes\\", \\"Dust\\" and \\"American Wedding\\" were performed at a majority of the shows, and \\"Strawberry Swing\\" \\"We All Try\\" were performed four times each. Portions of \\"No Church in the Wild\\" and \\"Made in America\\", along with \\"I Miss You\\" and \\"Thinkin Bout You\\" were also performed. The performances of \\"American Wedding\\" were accompanied by comedic moments where Ocean played Guitar Hero. Ocean performed at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival. Impact Kanye West, a fan of Nostalgia, Ultra, asked Ocean to work on Watch the Throne, which led to Ocean meeting Beyonc√© and Jay-Z. Before the release of Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean was a relatively unknown artist who made a majority of his money from ghostwriting. Within six months, it was noted that Ocean had become the \\"go-to vocal hook man.\\" The release of the mixtape interested rap recording artist and producer Kanye West, who was reported to be a big fan. West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off Watch the Throne, a collaborative record with rapper Jay-Z. Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks \\"No Church in the Wild\\" and \\"Made in America\\". Singer Beyonc√© heard of the mixtape through her husband Jay-Z and was a fan of it. She subsequently invited Ocean to co-write \\"I Miss You\\" for her album 4. Discussing how she first heard of Ocean and Nostalgia, Ultra, she commented; \\"Jay-Z had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him‚Äîliterally the next morning. I asked him to fly to New York and work on my record. West also offered to appear on Ocean's debut album, but Ocean refused, saying \\"as much as I want to work with you‚Ä¶ I kind of want to do this without you. I kind of want to do it on my own.\\" Rapper Nas was also a fan of the mixtape, writing that \\"He's new, he's fresh. He doesn't sound fly-by-night. The moment you hear it ‚Äî I hear what he's sayin', and I relate.\\" Nas also stated on Twitter that he and Ocean were collaborating on a song from Nas's tenth studio album Life Is Good, though the material never made the album. Chicago born rapper Lupe Fiasco expressed a positive opinion of the release too. Ocean quickly became Odd Future's main singing highlight, providing vocal hooks on Odd Future albums like BlackenedWhite, Goblin, and The Odd Future Tape Vol. 2. Ocean toured with the group on several occasions and made appearances during their shows. On January 5, 2012, the BBC announced that Ocean had finished in second place of the BBC's Sound of 2012 poll. In addition, MTV described the mixtape as a \\"cult classic\\". On August 2, 2012, the music video for \\"Swim Good\\" was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards: Best Direction and Best Male Video, with Ocean being nominated for Best New Artist for his work with the video. Accolades The record was nominated for Best International Album at the 2012 Swedish Grammis Awards. Despite being a mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra was featured on several music critics' and publications' end-of-year albums lists. Pitchfork Media put it number 35 on its list of the year's top albums, writing that \\"Chris Breaux, who goes by Frank Ocean, is a male R&B; singer with male R&B; contradictions: As much as he wants to listen to his heart, he can't completely ignore his dick.\\" The Guardian writer Tim Jonze named it the year's third best album, musing \\"unafraid to tackle suicide, abortion and absent fathers, this free mixtape introduced one of our most refreshing new R&B; stars.\\" The A.V. Club ranked the album number 15 on its year-end list, commenting that \\"Nostalgia, Ultra became a runaway Internet hit that showed off Ocean's coaxing croon as well as his outr√© songwriting skills. Sweetly romantic, yet pensive and moody, Nostalgia is an R&B; record for manics, from the hazy lament of 'Novacane' to the inward-looking contradiction of 'Songs For Women' to the clever pop remakes of The Eagles' 'Hotel California' and Coldplay's 'Strawberry Swing'.\\" Rolling Stone named it the 24th best album of the year, writing \\"the debut mixtape from the 24-year-old singer (and Odd Future member) is an avant-R&B; killer.\\" Complex named it the fourth best album of the year and the second best mixtape. Time named it the fifth best album of the year, and wrote that \\"Ocean also weaves audio of a tape recorder in rewind, video games and Nicole Kidman's adulterous monologue from Eyes Wide Shut into his songs to give the album a personal feel ‚Äî as if Ocean were gifting us with a collection of sounds that he finds emotionally meaningful.\\" Spin named it the 41st best album of the year while Mojo placed the album at number 49. Robert Christgau named it the fourth best album of the year in his Pazz & Jop dean's list. In 2019, the album was ranked 41st on The Guardian's 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list. The track \\"Novacane\\" also received widespread critical acclaim. It was listed as one of the best songs of the year by The New York Times, Ology, Spin, Zimbio, and Pitchfork Media named both the video and the song as amongst the best of the year. Controversy Don Henley of The Eagles In March 2012, controversy arose over the track \\"American Wedding\\", which samples The Eagles' song \\"Hotel California\\". Don Henley of the Eagles \\"had threatened legal action over Ocean's track\\", claiming that Ocean's version of the song was illegal. The track was widely removed from the internet following this controversy, being removed from music sharing sites such as YouTube. A spokesman for the band announced that a lawsuit would be filed against Ocean if performed the song live. > \\"Frank Ocean did not merely 'sample' a portion of the Eagles' Hotel > California; he took the whole master track, plus the song's existing melody, > and replaced the lyrics with his own. This is not creative, let alone > 'intimidating.' It's illegal. For the record, Don Henley has not threatened > or instituted any legal action against Frank Ocean, although the Eagles are > now considering whether they should.\\" Several publications noted that the song was released for free on a non- profitable mixtape, and that \\"live covers of famous songs are common in live performances\\", and that sampling is a common practice on mixtapes. Ocean responded to the controversy via his Tumblr account: > \\"He (They) threatened to sue if I perform it again. I think that's fuckin > awesome. I guess if I play it at Coachella it'll cost me a couple hundred > racks. If I don't show up to court, it'll be a judgement against me & will > probably show up on my credit report. Oh well.

Shit's weird. Ain't this guy rich as fuck? Why sue the new guy? I > didn't make a dime off that song. I released it for free. If anything I'm > paying homage.\\" Ocean performed the song live occasionally with an altered arrangement not utilizing the original \\"Hotel California\\" sample. Henley eventually spoke out on the controversy, defending his stance on the 2012 litigation threat and referring to Ocean as \\"talentless\\".

It rises on Dundry Hill and supplies Barrow Gurney Reservoirs before flowing through various villages to Clevedon where it drains into the Bristol Channel. During the past 1,000 years it has powered at least ten watermills, however only one is still functional. Since 2003 initiatives have been undertaken to clean up the river, improving water quality and encouraging wildlife. River course Millpond at Barrow Gurney The Land Yeo has its origins at several small springs on the western edge of Dundry Hill. It is one of the small streams which feed Barrow Gurney Reservoirs near the village of Barrow Gurney, which provide drinking water for Bristol. It then flows through the village of Barrow Gurney alongside the B3130 road, where it can be seen in millponds. It then flows north beneath the A370 road and the Bristol to Exeter railway line close to an old Roman settlement at Gatcombe. It then flows west past the Tyntesfield Estate, north of Nailsea where it is crossed by Jacklands Bridge and south of Wraxall, continuing through a man made watercourse, past Tickenham where it is the northern boundary of the Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI. It then passes under the M5 motorway, through Clevedon where it joins the Middle Yeo and drains into the Bristol Channel. Mills During the 18th and 19th centuries the Land Yeo powered a series of mills, with some dating back to the time of the Domesday Book. These included corn and gristmills and those adapted for the production of snuff. There were three mills on the Land Yeo in Barrow Gurney. The Upper Barrow Mill, which had an Overshot water wheel, was a Gristmill which is known to have been operating in 1839. By 1866 it was running as a corn mill, and ceased operation by 1935. The Middle Mill was converted to snuff manufacture by Peter Lilly a tobacconist from Bristol around 1800 and became part of the W.D. & H.O. Wills tobacco manufacturing company. It ceased mill operations by 1839 and by 1885 both the leat and millpond had disappeared. The Lower Mill is known have been grinding corn in the 19th century. It was rebuilt in 1909 when an iron overshot watermill of diameter was installed and steam power introduced. The mill is still used to produce animal feeds, however the waterwheel and millpond, which remain, are no longer in use. The next mill downstream is in the parish of Long Ashton close to the site of the Gatcombe Roman Settlement. There is evidence of a snuff mill at the site in 1769, however the current building dates from the early 19th century. By 1846 it had been converted to grind mustard, annatto and drugs, but by 1874 was a flour mill. The internal machinery is still in place and the mill has been designated as a Grade II listed building. In the same parish stood Kincott Mill which had stood since at least the 13th century. By the early 19th century rented out for snuff grinding and in the 1830s a steam engine was installed to power a flour and corn mill. Later it was owned by an iron founder, who made edge tools and other farm implements and installed cast-iron water wheels. To the north of the village of Flax Bourton are the remains of Bourton Mill which may have existed at the time of the Domesday Book and strong documentary evidence exists from 1769. Between 1839 and 1885 the river was diverted into the tailrace of the mill, eliminating a bend in the river. All that remains of the three-storey mill is a single storey garage of a private house. At Watercress Farm, Wraxall is the only waterwheel still operating on the River. The diameter wheel, which was built before 1885 and is housed in a small brick building is used as a water pump. The other mill in the parish of Wraxall operated in the 18th and 19th centuries. It fell out of use by 1885 and was ruined by 1950. The only remains are crumbling walls by the entrance to Wraxall House. The mill at Tickenham was established in the middle of the 12th century by Canons of the Abbey of St Augustine, (now Bristol Cathedral). In the 19th century it was owned by the Ashton Court Estate and in the 20th century was used as a water pump. It has now been converted into a private house. There were at least two mills at Clevedon. The Tuck Mills lay in the fields south of Clevedon Court and were used for fulling cloth. The other mills were near Wain's Hill and probably date from the early 17th century. Restoration In 2003 a group known as the Friends of the Land Yeo was set up to maintain and enhance the river, including the removal of debris. The subsequent improvements in water quality have increased the numbers of fish and improved the river as a habitat for birds and mammals including kingfishers, little egrets, herons, swans and otters. The group have also been developing a series of river walks. A grant, in 2011, of ¬£200,000 to fund work on the wetlands of the North Somerset Levels will enable further work to enhance biodiversity to be undertaken.

Early examples are \\"City of the Dead\\", B-side of \\"Complete Control\\", \\"1-2 Crush On You\\", the B-side of \\"Tommy Gun\\" released as a single on 24 November 1978, and their version of Booker T. & the M.G.'s' classic \\"Time Is Tight\\", released on the 1980 extended play Black Market Clash. Both songs can also be heard on the 1993 compilation album, Super Black Market Clash. He also played on their later albums Sandinista! released on 12 December 1980 as a triple album, the single This Is Radio Clash released on 20 November 1981 and Combat Rock released on 14 May 1982 through Epic Records. He was introduced to The Clash through their drummer, and school friend of Barnacle's, Topper Headon, and reportedly became involved in The Clash's infamous 1978 \\"pigeon shooting\\" incident. Barnacle formed a horn section in 1978 with trumpeter Luke Tunney, called the Hit And Run Horns (named after the band that they were members of at the time). In 1979 they added Annie Whitehead on trombone. These three played on many sessions together for the next three years or so (until Pete Thoms came in on trombone in 1982). Barnacle collaborated with The Ruts on their first two albums, both on Virgin label, The Crack, released in September 1979, and Grin & Bear It, released in October 1980. After the death of their frontman, Malcolm Owen, found dead from a heroin overdose on 14 July 1980 at the age of 26, the band continued as Ruts D.C. (where \\"D.C.\\" standing for the Latin term \\"Da Capo\\", meaning \\"back to the beginning\\") in a different musical vein. Barnacle became a stable member of the band and they released two other albums, Animal Now in May 1981 on Virgin, and Rhythm Collision released in July 1982 on Bohemian Records. Ruts D.C. split in 1983. During 1979‚Äì1980 he also contributed to M's debut album, New York ‚Ä¢ London ‚Ä¢ Paris ‚Ä¢ Munich, released in 1979, and to Sanity Stomp, released by Kevin Coyne in 1980. The 1980s (1981‚Äì1989) In 1981, contributed to the debut albums by Positive Noise - Heart of Darkness, Stray Cats and In Trance as Mission by Simple Minds plus \\"Power and the Passion\\" by Midnight Oil and also performed saxophone on Rick Wakeman's 1984, a solo concept album based on the classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. That year he also played saxophone on the Black Snake Diamond R√∂le debut solo album by former Soft Boys frontman Robyn Hitchcock. But, one of Barnacle's longest associations has been with Level 42, with whom he has played on several albums, including the band's 1981 debut, the 1984 True Colours, the 1985 World Machine, and the 1987 Running in the Family. From 1990 to 1994 Barnacle toured with Level 42 and recorded two of the band's albums, Guaranteed and Forever Now. The horn section he formed with British trumpet and fluegelhorn player, John Thirkell, for Level 42 is known as The Hen Pecked Horns. Since then, Barnacle and Thirkell provided the horn section to many recordings, and, along with trombonist Peter Thoms, they formed The Phantom Horns, one of the UK's most respected horn sections that appears on a number of recordings from 1987 on. They also recorded a widely acclaimed brass-sample CD Phantom Horns, which was re-issued by Zero-G as a double CD-rom in 2011. Equally impressive, and more comprehensive, was Brit Horns brass-sample CD featuring Gary Barnacle, Peter Thoms and Stuart Brooks, which was re-issued as a double audio/WAV CD by AMG in 2010. Both of these sample CDs have, and continue to be, widely used on commercial recordings worldwide. In 1982, he and ex-Positive Noise singer, Ross Middleton, formed an electropop duo called Leisure Process. The Band released four singles on Epic label, two in 1982, \\"Love Cascade\\" and \\"A Way You'll Never Be\\", which featured Mark King and Phil Gould of Level 42, and two in 1983, \\"Cashflow\\" and \\"Anxiety\\". All four singles were produced by Martin Rushent.

Two years later, in 1984, with his brother Steve already in the band, when Billy Currie and Dave Formula departed the band, Gary and Andy Barnett replaced them for what would become Visage's Beat Boy album, which was released in September 1984 and produced two singles, \\"Love Glove\\" and \\"Beat Boy\\". A decision to make Visage a live band instead of a strictly studio-based project failed and the band subsequently split in 1985. In 1983, he contributed to Catch as Catch Can by pop singer, Kim Wilde (whom he dated in the mid 1980s), and also to In Strict Tempo by Dave Ball, Private Dancer by Tina Turner.

The hot spots of the insurrection were large areas around Dresden, Leipzig and Zwickau. The disputes over hunting rights within gamekeeping reserves established by the nobility initially led to unrest in game in Wehlen, which rapidly spread to other districts (√Ñmter). However, the government in Saxony was able to bring these riots under control by early July. The previous harsh winter of 1789/1790 and the drought in 1790, however, increased the potential for conflict. So in the summer of 1790, more and more peasants rebelled against the Saxon state, the revolt being centred on Wechselburg. One of the best known spokesmen for the peasants was Christian Benjamin Gei√üler, also called \\"the Rebel of Liebstadt\\" (\\"Rebell von Liebstadt\\"). By mid-August, the farmers had taken control of fifteen patrimonial court districts, covering an area of 5,000 square kilometres. The areas around Stolpen, Dresden, Radeberg, Dippoldiswalde, the two Lusatias and Torgau were now affected by the uprising. The riots took place in a disorganized and very spontaneous manner. Thus, in the area of K√∂nigstein and in Upper Lusatia labour was withdrawn. There were even assaults on castles and Saxon military units were disarmed by the peasants. On 23 August in Meissen, 2,000 peasants, armed with flails, clubs and axes, forced the release of imprisoned rebels. The main demands of the peasants were the abolition of hunting privileges, the abolition of socage, the prohibition of the conversion of contributions in kind into financial interest by the lords or Saxon district offices. Initially the peasants succeeded in getting the lords to waiver all duties, socage and interest. Some lords were even expelled by their peasants. But a major military operation in September 1790 finally overthrew the rebellion.S√§chsischer Bauernaufstand 1790 at Bauernkriege.de.

Originally the WSC received funding for research and conservation through organizing angling trips to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East. These expeditions were a joint venture between the WSC and Moscow State University. In 1998, WSC hired Guido Rahr as Executive Director, formerly with the conservation organization Oregon Trout, where he developed an approach to salmon conservation that focused on proactive protection of the strongest remaining populations (stronghold strategy). The organization expanded rapidly between 1999 and 2010.

There were many different cultural groups across the West African region who were practicing different forms of spirituality. As the Europeans explored and took control of parts of the country during the colonial days, so did their religion. Christianity is the religion with the largest following in Ghana. Christian denominations include Catholics, Methodists, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Seventh-Day Adventists, Pentecostals, Baptists etc. According to the census figures of the year 2000, out of Ghana's 18.8 million people, Christians made up 69 percent of the population of Ghana. The 2010 Population and Housing Census puts the figure at slightly over 71 percent of the total population of over 24 million people. A 2015 study estimated some 50,000 believers in Christ from a Muslim background. Denominations=Methodism in Ghana Wesley Methodist Cathedral in Kumasi The Methodist Church Ghana came into existence as a result of the missionary activities of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, inaugurated with the arrival of Joseph Rhodes Dunwell to the Gold Coast (Ghana) in 1835. Like the mother church, the Methodist Church in Ghana was established by people of Anglican background. Roman Catholic and Anglican missionaries came to the Gold Coast from the 15th century. A school was established in Cape Coast by the Anglicans during the time of Philip Quaque, a Ghanaian priest. Those who came out of this school had scriptural knowledge and scriptural materials supplied by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. A member a resulting Bible study groups, William De- Graft, requested Bibles through captain Potter of the ship Congo. Not only were Bibles sent, but also a Methodist missionary. In the first eight years of the Church‚Äôs life, 11 out of 21 missionaries who worked in the Gold Coast died. Thomas Birch Freeman, who arrived at the Gold Coast in 1838 was a pioneer of missionary expansion. Between 1838 and 1857, he carried Methodism from the coastal areas to Kumasi in the Asante hinterland of the Gold Coast. He also established Methodist Societies in Badagry and AbeoKuta in Nigeria with the assistance of William De-Graft. By 1854, the church was organized into circuits constituting a district with T.B. Freeman as chairman. Freeman was replaced in 1856 by William West. The district was divided and extended to include areas in the then Gold Coast and Nigeria by the synod in 1878, a move confirmed at the British Conference. The district were Gold Coast (Ghana) District, with T.R. Picot as chairman and Yoruba and Popo District, with John Milum as chairman. Methodist evangelization of northern Ghana began in 1910. After a long period of conflict with the colonial government, missionary work was established in 1955. Paul Adu was the first indigenous missionary to northern Ghana. In July 1961, the Methodist Church in Ghana became autonomous, and was called the Methodist Church Ghana, based on a deed of foundation, part of the church's Constitution and Standing Orders. The Methodist Church Ghana has a total membership of close to 600,000. The church has 15 dioceses, 3,814 societies, 1,066 pastors, 15,920 local preachers, 24,100 lay leaders, many schools, an orphanage, hospitals and clinics. Latter-day Saints Accra Ghana Temple (LDS) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 62,000 members in 207 congregations in Ghana. They also have 28 family history centers, 3 missions, and 1 temple in Ghana. Christian Council of Ghana Presbyterian Church of Ghana in Ada Foah The Christian Council of Ghana (CCG) was founded on 30 October 1929 by five churches namely African Methodist Episcopal (AME), Zion Church, English Church Mission (Anglican), Ewe Presbyterian Church (now Evangelical Presbyterian Church); Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Wesleyan Methodist Church (now the Methodist Church Ghana). The purpose was the search for unity and to work with members on issues of social concern and be the voice of the voiceless in society. Currently the CCG comprises fifteen member churches and two Christian Organizations (see annex three). The CCG has over the years gone through a series of restructuring and renewal processes in a bid to develop a relevant, efficient and effective organisation that is pro-active and responsive to challenges facing the member churches. In the search for relevance and common witness, the determining factors have been global and national macro socio- economic and political trends such as political governance ranging from military rule to multi-party democracy. Impact of Christianity Various aspects of Ghanaian development and nation-building have all been impacted upon due to the role Christianity plays. Education At every level of education in the country, there are mission schools that exists with the purposes of: *Teaching Government of Ghana approved curricula *Imparting moral discipline into students However, the main aim of establishing these schools is to impact the values of the various faiths or missions into the younger generation to ensure continuity. Almost all churches have schools at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education in the country. Consistently, over 95 percent of the country's top second cycle institutions are all mission schools. The Notable amongst them are: *Adisadel College - Anglican - Cape Coast *Mfantsipim School - Methodist - Cape Coast *Wesley Girls High School - Methodist - Cape Coast *St. Augustine's _C_ ollege - Catholic- Cape coast *Holy Child School - Catholic - Cape coast *Prempeh College - Methodist/Presbyterian - Kumasi *Opoku Ware School - Catholic - Kumasi *St. Peter's Boys Senior Secondary School - Catholic - Nkwatia Kwahu *Pope John Senior High School and Minor Seminary - Catholic - Effiduase Koforidua *St. Roses Girls Secondary School - Catholic - Akwatia *Aburi Girls' Secondary School - Presbyterian- Aburi *St. Louis Secondary School - Catholic - Kumasi *Archbishop Potter Girls' Secondary School - Catholic - Takoradi *Presbyterian Boys Secondary School - Presbyterian - Accra Health care delivery Currently, 42% of all the nation's health care needs are catered for by health establishments belonging to various Christian bodies in the country. The umbrella organization of which the various mission hospitals, clinics and facilities are members of is known as the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG). Some of these facilities are in deprived areas of the country. CHAG serves as a link between Government and its Development Partners and CHAG Member Institutions and provides support to its members through capacity strengthening, coordination of activities, lobbying and advocacy, public relations and translation of government policies. The goal of CHAG is to improve the health status of people living in Ghana, especially the marginalized and the impoverished, in fulfillment of Christ's healing ministry. CHAG‚Äôs 183 Member Institutions are therefore predominantly located in the rural (underserved) areas. CHAG plays a complementary role to the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and is the second largest provider of health services in the country.

She served as the regent of Schaumburg-Lippe during the minority of her son from 1787 to 1799.  Life  Juliane was the daughter of Landgrave William of Hesse-Philippsthal (1726‚Äì1810) and his wife Ulrike Eleonore, Landgravine of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld (1732‚Äì1795). She spent some of her youth in 's-Hertogenbosch, where her father served as a Dutch general. She received a German education. On 10 October 1780 she married in Philippsthal to Count Philip Ernest of Schaumburg-Lippe. Philipp Ernst, who was 57 years old at the time and already a widower, died after only seven years of marriage. Countess Juliane took up government, together with Count Johann Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Wallmoden-Gimborn as regent for her minor son George William. Immediately afterwards, Landgrave William of Hesse-Kassel occupied Schaumburg- Lippe militarily, arguing it was a fief of Hesse, and vacant after Philip II's death. With support from Hanover, Prussia and the Imperial Council, Juliane managed to achieve a rapid withdrawal of the Hessian troops. The Government of Juliane is considered extremely beneficial. She conducted thorough reforms of the economy and education, downsized the court, continued the tolerant policy towards the Jews her father-in-law had introduced and managed to cut taxes. She appointed Bernhard Christoph Faust as her personal physician, and helped him significantly with the introduction of the smallpox inoculation. Juliane initiated a redesign of Hagenburg Castle and she is considered the founder of the spa Bad Eilsen. She died after a severe cold and was buried in a mausoleum in the Schaumburg Forest. Count von Wallmoden-Gimborn continued to act as a regent for her son.

Document design is: \\"the field of theory and practice aimed at creating comprehensible, persuasive and usable functional documents\\".Jansen These forms and documents can have many different purposes such as collecting or providing information. Visualization and Visual Communication=Significance Eva Brumberger, an instructor in the professional writing program at Virginia Tech, surveyed professional writers about the nature of their work in order to evaluate what student writers are taught before entering the work force.Brumberger, 369, 392. These professional writers confirmed that their role has developed past the verbal communication dominant in the literature presented to students and has developed into mostly visual communication.Brumberger, 386 Definition Technical communicators must take data and convert it into information; this process is known as visualization, or visual communication.Blythe, 347. Because of the widespread use of digital media, modern technical communicators must also now think about visualization as it relates to digital forms and documents. Stuart K. Card, Jock D. Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman, editors of the book Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think, define visualization as the: \\"use of computer- supported, interactive, visual representations of data to amplify cognition\\". Though many forms and documents will still have a paper copy for distribution, most forms and documents are now utilized online in some fashion; this is why there is such focus on the computer-supported representations for maximal cognition. Brumberger defines visual communication as: \\"designing print, Web, and multimedia documents‚Ä¶creating visual displays of information/data, generating other visual material‚Ä¶and any other communication tasks which rely on visual language\\".Brumberger, 373. Examples There are many areas where professional writers utilize visualization. It is most useful in the following areas: complex documents, statistical and categorical data, personal services, and histories.Blythe, 348. Visual communication responsibilities include: designing visual content, determining when to use visual material, modifying existing material, and applying templates that already exist to material.Brumberger, 387. Visual communication tasks include designing: presentations, print documents, page layouts, images, and data displays. Human-Centered Design Human-centered design focuses on ensuring that the audience will comprehend the information being presented. It is: \\"how a frustrated and confused subject...comprehends a critical message in a crowded and noisy environment\\".Blythe, 349. The goal of human-centered design is \\"to make information accessible\\" and \\"to give form to data\\".Blythe, 350. Luke Wroblewski, senior director of Project Ideation and Design at Yahoo! Inc., and author of Web Form Design: Filling in the Blanks, also has some human-centered design ideas for web forms and documents.Wroblewski, 18. He says: \\"because people want what‚Äôs on the other side of a web form, their general tendency is to jump right in, start answering questions and hope to get it done quickly\\". As a result, he recommends designing a clear path to completion for the form or document. He also mentions messaging without proper priority, like hard-to- find error messages, and unconnected primary actions that can similarly cloud the steps people need to take in order to get through a form. For a web form to have human-centered design, information must be structured \\"in a logical pattern from start to finish\\".Wroblewski, 19. The Structure and Organization When a technical communicator is creating a form or document, it is vital that they pay close attention to structure and organization as these are the means that allow visualization to work. Functional Analysis In order to design a form or document, the writer should understand and evaluate the different constraints in the rhetorical situation; this is called functional analysis.Lentz & Maat, 387. One of the biggest components in analyzing a form or document is to determine the communicative purpose of the form or document. Leo Lentz and Henk Pander Maat, at the University of Utrecht, break down communicative purpose into four elements:Lentz & Maat, 388. :#intended communicative effect: the intended effect should fall into one of three categories; \\"a cognitive change in the mental state of the reader, who learns something or forms a particular attitude, a change in the reader's behavior, such as handling a machine or buying a product, or a change in the social reality as a result of the collective behavior of readers, such as the sale of a product\\". :#topic: this is based on the reader's needs, since the reader is the one expected to act on the information.Lentz & Maat, 389. :#target group: this should be a specific group described either by demographic variables or communicative predispositions.Lentz & Maat, 390. :#organizational goal: this is the change that should occur in every individual reader.Lentz & Maat, 391. After analyzing the communicative purpose, the technical communicator can design a form or document that will match the requirements and meet expectations for it.Lentz & Maat, 397. Explicit Structure One aspect of form and document creation that technical communicators should pay close attention to is explicit structure. When the structure is explicit, the reader can interact with the form or document on a more effective level.Farkas, 9. The technical communicator‚Äôs \\"primary means to make structure explicit is through headings and links\\". The technical communicator must add these headings when they are drafting the form or document, because the structure will remain implicit until they are added.Farkas, 10 The authors of Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love & Typography add hierarchy to the idea of making structure explicit. They say: \\"effective hierarchy gets people to look where you want them to look, when you want them to look there. Without it the reader is left confused and frustrated. Emphasis can be stressed by size, weight, color, style, and placement\\".\\"Meet Your Type\\", 26. Thus, emphasis from several different font decisions joins headings as a feature that makes structure explicit. Abstract Structure Another aspect to consider when designing a form or document is abstract structure. This is the idea that text has a graphical component.Power et al., 211. Text incorporates a graphical component not only because the words are: \\"often accompanied by conventional graphics such as pictures or diagrams, but they themselves form graphical elements such as titles, headings, chapters, sections, captions, paragraphs, and bulleted lists\\". When considering abstract structure in planning a form or document, a technical communicator must also look at what Richard Power, Nadjet Bouayad- Agha, and Donia Scott call document structure: \\"the organization of a document into graphical constituents like sections, paragraphs, sentences, bulleted lists, and figures\\".Power et al., 213. This document structure also goes hand- in-hand with the human-centered design aspect of visualization as pertaining to form and document creation. Technical communicators should look at their form or document to make sure that the abstract structure of the form or document is helping achieve the overall goal with the reader. Though it focuses on a visual and graphic effect, abstract structure also focuses on wording.Power et al., 216. The examples that follow are taken verbatim from Power, Bouayad-Agha, and Scott. They show a progression from a passage written by a technical communication novice (a), to an edit by a more experienced technical communicator (b), to an edit by a senior expert technical communicator (c). The successive changes are designed to make the structure and wording valid. :(a) :Elixir is a white cream. :It is used in the treatment of cold sores. :It contains aliprosan. This is effective against a range of viral skin disorders. :It should be used only on your lips and face. :(b) :Elixir is a white cream. :It is used in the treatment of cold sores. :It contains aliprosan. This is effective against a range of viral skin disorders. :It should be used ONLY on your lips and face. :(c) :Elixir is a white cream. It is used in the treatment of cold sores. It contains aliprosan. This is effective against a range of viral skin disorders. N.B. Elixir should be used only on your lips and face. Visual Organization Other considerations the technical communicator keeps in mind when creating a form or document include: number of pages, flush, capital letters, and bullets. =Number of Pages= If at all possible, using one page for the document or form is best because the reader can: \\"glance at the information without flipping pages or having to search for related sections, both results of poor planning that can distract and confuse the reader\\".Harvey, 20. =Flush= When typing a document, the technical communicator should make the text flush left because: \\"it‚Äôs the easiest to read because we read it most often\\".\\"Meet Your Type,\\" 29. Keeping the text flush left instead of justifying it: \\"[gives] the text a more harmonious appearance and makes it easier to read, since all wordspaces have the same width\\".\\"Erik Spiekermann‚Äôs Typo Tips\\", 6. The reason justified text should be avoided is because of the: \\"hideously [stretched] and [squished] words and spaces\\". =Capital Letters= Capital letters should not be used to accentuate words on a form or document; it is too distracting and disrupts the look of the form or document.\\"Erik Spiekermann‚Äôs Typo Tips\\", 1. When capital letters are absolutely necessary, say in the case of an acronym or abbreviation, small caps should be used, with or without initial caps. When capital letters are not absolutely necessary, the technical communicator should evaluate the effectiveness of italicizing the word or phrase for emphasis. =Bullets= Some technical communicators use hyphens for listed items; however, a writer should use bullets or centered points instead.\\"Erik Spiekermann‚Äôs Typo Tips\\", 7. Standard Expository Model In analyzing structure and organization for a form or document, it is beneficial for a technical communicator to determine if the form or document being created fits within a group of documents called the standard expository model (SE model). If the form or document being created is an SOE, then there are special strategies to writing the form or document. Standard expository models are: \\"nonfiction print documents that (1) are primarily informational rather than expressive; (2) are intended to be read linearly (broadly speaking, from beginning to end); and (3) reveal structure explicitly with at least one heading level but very often more.\\"Farkas, 12. If a form being created fits within the SE model, there are three main strategies to be employed when creating it. :#The first is to tuck introductions and conclusions.Farkas, 13. This means that there is no separate heading for the introduction and conclusion; instead, the introduction and conclusion aspects of the writing are within the first and last main points.Farkas, 13-14. :#The second strategy is to subdivide and indent subpoints within a section to account for brief subsections.Farkas, 14. :#The final strategy is to use stacked headings by adding subheadings underneath main headings, much like in this Wikipedia article itself. Language and Word Choice Gillian Harvey, a partner and senior designer at Plumbheavy Design Inc., a company that does graphic design and information design, has several recommendations for technical communicators regarding language and word choice.Harvey, 24. :#The first is to use vocabulary that the reader will easily understand; this is vital when creating a form or document with instructions the reader is expected to follow.Harvey, 21. :#Harvey also recommends the use of personal pronouns, especially \\"you\\" and \\"your,\\" to give the reader a feeling of ownership when reading a form or document.Harvey, 22. :#Finally, Harvey instructs technical communicators to use active phrases rather than passive phrases because they are easier for a reader to comprehend. Typeface Selection After evaluating the purpose and desired effect of a form or document, and creating a structure and wording that meets that purpose and effect, a technical communicator may think the majority of the job is complete. However, the typeface used for a form and document can greatly affect not only the reader, but the purpose and effect of that form or document. Typeface vs. font Most simply, \\"a font is what you use, and a typeface is what you see\\". The Typographer‚Äôs Glossary defines typeface as: \\"An artistic interpretation, or design, of a collection of alphanumeric symbols\\".\\"The Typographer‚Äôs Glossary\\", 26. Typeface includes \\"letters, numerals, punctuation, various symbols, and more\\". \\"A typeface is usually grouped together in a family containing individual fonts for italic, bold, and other variations of the primary design\\". A font, on the other hand, is: \\"a collection of letters, numbers, punctuation, and other symbols used to set text (or related) matter\\". To further explain, \\"font refers to the physical embodiment‚Ä¶while typeface refers to the design\\". In any event, the terms \\"font\\" and \\"typeface\\" are used interchangeably by some authors and designers.\\"The Typographer‚Äôs Glossary\\", 13. Appropriate Selection Jo Mackiewicz, from the Composition and Linguistics Department of the University of Minnesota Duluth, has done extensive research into typeface and has published multiple articles on the topic.Mackiewicz (2004), 131. Mackiewicz says that students should: \\"select typefaces that are appropriate for their technical documents\\".Mackiewicz (2004), 114 What Mackiewicz means when she talks about an \\"appropriate typeface\\" is that it contributes to the desired \\"overall rhetorical effect\\" and conveys \\"more specific effects‚Ä¶as intended\\".Mackiewicz (2004), 118. In another article, Mackiewicz points out that \\"typefaces substantially contribute to the visual, as opposed to the verbal, language of documents\\".Mackiewicz (2005), 291. This is important, since it has already been established that professional technical communicators see their role as largely visual as compared to verbal.Brumberger, 386. Personality In selecting an appropriate typeface, Mackiewicz focuses on what she calls \\"typeface personality\\". She researches other technical communicators‚Äô works to come up with a definition of typeface personality as \\"that aspect of typeface that imbues it ‚Äòwith the power to evoke in the perceiver certain emotional and cognitive responses‚Äô\\" and \\"the ability to convey different feelings and moods‚Ä¶strength, elegance, agitation, silliness, friendliness, scariness, and other moods\\".Mackiewicz (2004), 113. Mackiewicz further explains that: \\"increased attention to typeface personality is especially important now that students have access to thousands of typefaces, many of which can detract from or conflict with the seriousness, professionalism, and competency that students intend to convey\\".Mackiewicz (2004), 128. The selection of typeface is also important in situations where more than one typeface is present in a form or document. Mackiewicz says: \\"if more than one typeface is being used within a document, students should also carefully consider the extent to which the personalities of the typefaces they have selected are concordant\\". =History= One way that Mackiewicz notes that technical communicators can determine a typeface‚Äôs personality is through looking at its history; she says: \\"the personality a typeface conveys may stem in large part from the ways in which that typeface has been used in the past\\".Mackiewicz (2004), 121. To show what she means, Mackiewicz notes that the typeface Fette Fraktur is rarely used today because it was used in Nazi propaganda from 1933 to 1945. Because of situations like the one involving Fette Fraktur, Mackiewicz points out: \\"the ways in which a typeface has been used [in the past] can influence the overall affect (sic) of a student‚Äôs document and, consequently, it can send an unintended message\\". Impressions on Readers As in every stage of form and document design, technical communicators must be constantly aware of the impressions of design decision on the reader. Pamela W. Henderson, Joan L. Giese, and Joseph A. Cote, faculty in the Department of Marketing at Washington State University, point out that: \\"it is important to determine the impact of the impressions created by typeface\\".Henderson et al., 60, 71. Their research also shows \\"that individual differences [in typeface] can affect attentiveness to aesthetics\\", or the pleasing effect of the form or document.Henderson et al., 71. The Font Shop professionals also have a warning concerning typeface and its impression on readers. They recommend \\"[avoiding] the embarrassment of typographic rejection by first determining the likes and dislikes of your target audience\\".\\"Meet Your Type,\\" 18. Additionally, Jo Mackiewicz recommends technical communicators consider typefaces that are both legible and readable. Her research has shown that legible typefaces have \\"the quality of being decipherable and recognizable\\" and are important \\"in situations where people are scanning pages, reading signs, or skimming through catalogs or lists\\". One example of a legible typeface is Univers, while an illegible typeface example would be Snap ITC.Mackiewicz (2004), 119. On the other hand, typefaces that are readable have: \\"the quality of giving ‚Äòvisual comfort,‚Äô which is especially important in long stretches of text\\". Mackiewicz uses Times New Roman as an example of an easily read typeface while Impact typeface is less so. Legibility and readability are important aspects of typeface to consider if the reader is going to be required to read and comprehend a large amount of text. Serif vs. Sans Serif One aspect of typeface selection to consider is whether or not to use serif or sans serif typefaces. Serif typefaces are \\"based on the carvings of the ancient Romans\\" and \\"feature small ‚Äòfeet‚Äô at the end of the letterforms\\".\\"Meet Your Type,\\" 12. Jo Mackiewicz points out that: \\"traditionally, serif typefaces have been used for the body text of technical (as well as other) documents because they seem to be more readable than sans serif typefaces\\".Mackiewicz (2004), 117. On the other hand, sans serif typefaces \\"were designed for the industrial age\\" and are \\"hard-working and modern, with no need for fancy serifs\\". Sans serif typefaces \\"are often used in ‚Äòdisplay‚Äô elements like headings, diagrams, and tables\\". Based on this information, technical communicators are advised to \\"pair a serif and sans serif\\" in their forms or documents.\\"Meet Your Type,\\" 23. Electronic Selection Because of the prevalence of computers and other electronic media in the modern world, there are some special considerations for forms and documents that will be online. New typefaces are being developed specifically for forms and documents to be presented electronically. ClearType, developed by Microsoft in 1998 \\"to improve the legibility of typefaces viewed on LCD displays\\", encompasses seven of these new typefaces.Chaparro et al., 37. They were \\"designed for online reading of business documents, email, and web pages\\". However, after a study of the online legibility of ClearType, Times New Roman, and Verdana typefaces, researchers concluded \\"that it is not the technology alone that dictates legibility\\", as some of the ClearType typefaces were more legible than other ClearType typefaces and one of the non-ClearType typefaces.Chaparro et al., 46. A technical communicator, creating an online document, should carefully analyze the readability of the typeface selected for their form or document. Case Study: Times New Roman In order to see how the various typeface aspects work together for typeface selection, look at the Times New Roman typeface. Mackiewicz notes that its letterforms \\"display complexity and perfection\\".Mackiewicz (2005), 308. She also lists features of the Times New Roman typeface that make it professional in personality: \\"moderate weight, moderate thick-to-thin transition, balanced straight-edged and rounded terminals, moderate x-height to cap-height ratio, uppercase J that sits on the baseline, horizontal crossbar on the e letterform, double-story a letterform, and double-story g letterform\\". Reid Goldsborough, a syndicated newspaper columnist, provides the history of the Times New Roman typeface. Times New Roman \\"was commissioned by the British newspaper The Times in 1931\\", and in 2004, the U.S. State Department \\"mandated that all U.S. diplomatic documents use Times New Roman instead of the previous Courier New\\".Goldsborough, 15. In Jo Mackiewicz‚Äôs study of typefaces, \\"one participant said that Times New Roman could be used in ‚Äòany lengthy passages that need good readability\\".Mackiewicz (2005), 300. Finally, in a study that evaluated Times New Roman against the newer ClearType typefaces, it was found that no participants confused Times New Roman letterforms with Times New Roman numbers, symbols, or other letterforms.Chaparro et al., 44. Based on these observations, a technical communicator could determine that Times New Roman would be an effective typeface for a form or document if the purpose was professional, the document was being read in any format, and reader readability was required. Evaluation David Sless, director and co-founder of the Communication Research Institute talks about what he calls: \\"a crucial aspect of public communication: the demonstration, through testing and measurement, that an [organization‚Äôs] communication with its public does indeed work; that evidence can be produced to show that the information design is of the highest quality\\".Sless, 250. He is calling attention to the fact that documented evaluation is an important part of form and document design. Evaluation will show where a form or document needs to be improved, even when that form or document meets the overall needs for which it was created. For example, Michael Turton, a veteran designer of transactional documents and forms, was surprised to find that coworkers were having trouble with a form he designed that he knew was adequate.Turton, 191, 193. The form required employees to check boxes that measured 7mm by 6mm, but reported that these boxes needed to be bigger.Turton, 192. Knowing that the boxes were adequate, Turton asked the employees to show him the problem; as it turned out, the employees were left-handed and when they were trying to mark a box, their writing hand was covering the writing on the form. So, through evaluation, Turton was able to discover the needs of his audience and created a left- handed form as well. This shows the importance of evaluation in form and document creation. Criteria for Evaluation Sless points out several key factors to look for when evaluating a form or document. He recommends evaluation to determine if a form or document is: \\"attractive, socially appropriate, physically appropriate, respectful [of the audience], credible, and containing information that is accessible and usable\\".Sless, 251. When to Evaluate a Form or Document Sless diagrams a circular pattern for the \\"systematic process\\" of forms and documents.Sless, 251-252. There are seven stages to his diagram, and then number seven leads back into number one. The seven stages are: scoping, benchmarking, prototyping, testing, refining (returning to step four as many times as needed), implementing, and monitoring.Sless, 252. He says that evaluation must take place at three points in this \\"systematic process\\": during step two, during steps four and five, and during step seven. A form or document should be evaluated at the benchmarking stage to determine how a current design is working. It should be used in the testing and refining stages to evaluate changes being made. Finally, the form or document should be evaluated during the monitoring stage as it is in use to \\"maintain its optimal performance\\". Sless emphasizes the importance of testing at these designated times instead of evaluating as time and money permits. Case Study: A Look Into Forms in the Medical Field There can be many individualized decisions and problems that can occur depending on the form or document being created, the target audience, and the organization producing the form or document. These problems can occur because of rules set by a technical communicator‚Äôs own company or an external governing body. Problems can also occur based on technical problems that the technical communicator could not prepare for. To highlight these potential problems, look at forms and documents in the medical field. Potential Technical Problems In a study done by professionals from multiple companies and universities, family medical practices administered surveys on paper forms and electronically.Galliher et al., 154. However, the team could not accurately judge the advantage of the electronic form because of problems with the firewall and \\"institutional computer security issues\\".Galliher et al., 158. The researchers report that: \\"there does not appear to be an easy solution to these technical issues, especially in instances where the practice is part of a larger organization (e.g., university, hospital) that has strict requirements and procedures in place to limit transmission of information between the institution and external Internet Web sites\\". This example shows where technology itself can interfere with the effectiveness of a form. Also, institutional requirements can limit the design being created by a technical writer. Tailoring Information to Federal Regulations Sometimes, there are external restrictions on a form or document that could affect the design process. Rita Tomlin, a freelance writer and instructor at San Diego State University, investigates the implications of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on medical writing.Tomlin, 289, 310. Tomlin says, \\"An essential task for the medical writer is to tailor data presentation and document content to the FDA‚Äôs expectations.\\"Tomlin, 292. The medical writer is therefore restricted by FDA expectations and not just organizational or personal expectations. Medical writers are expected to come to \\"an understanding of the FDA‚Äôs complex expectations\\" by \\"careful reading and interpretation of the FDA regulations and guidance documents.\\" This is an example of the type of work a form or document designer may have to do. There could be external research needed before form or document design or redesign can occur.

Mikoshi and approximately twenty floats are drawn through the streets, accompanied by odori, drums, and other performers. It has a two hundred and fifty-year history and was designated as an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property in 2009. History The festival in Shinj≈ç, and in particular their use of floats called , is thought to have been initiated in 1756 in the midst of a famine during the H≈çreki era. The event was planned by Tozawa Masanobu (1720‚Äì1756) who was the head of the Shinj≈ç domain. The festival served not only to serve as a time of prayer for the upcoming harvest, but also to improve morale among the populace. The floats appearing in the festival are thought to have been initially influenced by the Gion Matsuri, but have since focused on themes related to kabuki, legendary animals, and elaborate scenes in nature. In 2009, the festival was granted the Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property designation by the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs. Event structure A float featuring a snake during the initial yoi matsuri of the Shinjo Matsuri. The festival has three stages: , , and . Floats will parade through the city while being accompanied by performers who play flutes, cymbals, taiko, and shamisen on a set repertoire of four pieces. The floats themselves are constructed by various municipalities within the city, and each municipality has its own associated performance group. Approximately 20 groups are represented in total. Generally, floats include life-size versions of famous kabuki performers, animals, and historical figures that are depicted in nature such as on mountains or rivers. One performance specific to the Shinj≈ç Matsuri is the , a local dance that features men wearing deer-like hoods. In 2015, event coordinators began using GPS systems to position floats for the parade, help event attendants locate floats, and to ease concerns over traffic congestion.

The work is a critique of the doctrine of equal opportunity. Cavanagh argues against the conventional understanding of equal opportunity, in particular both meritocracy and most substantial interpretations of equality, including the idea of ‚Äòequal life chances‚Äô. Instead, he argues for a more limited approach of trying to eliminate specific kinds of discrimination (including race discrimination), together with trying to provide enough opportunities, and help to access them, such that most people have some degree of control over their lives. Criticism=Allegations of racism The book caused some controversy when the author was appointed as an adviser to then Labour Minister David Blunkett when it was revealed that the book argued that it was sometimes rational (in an economic sense) for white employers to discriminate against black applicants This led to widespread calls for Cavanagh to be sacked, with questions tabled in Parliament, and the affair rumbled on for a few days. The Guardian's letters page carried a balance of letters for and against Cavanagh. Reviews and academic reaction The book received positive reviews in the Times Educational Supplement The Spectator, and in academic journals including Ethics, Notre Dame Philosophical Review, Theory and Research in Education and Contemporary Political Theory. Other reviews were more mixed, including the London Review of Books, The Independent, Philosophical Books and Political Studies Review and Utilitas, the latter two arguing that the work does not adequately engage other scholarly literature relating to equality of opportunity by authors such as Joel Feinberg or George Sher.

He joined the Labour Party in 2010, running unsuccessfully for that party at the 2011 general election but was subsequently elected to the Seanad. Background Harte was educated at St Eunan's College in Letterkenny, and obtained a B.A. in Psychology from University College Dublin. He set up his own insurance broker business, Harte Insurances, at the age of 24. The son of former Fine Gael TD Paddy Harte, he was elected as a Fine Gael candidate to Letterkenny Town Council in 1994 and subsequently to Donegal County Council in 1999. In 2006 he resigned from Fine Gael after failing to secure a nomination from the party to contest the Donegal North-East constituency for the 2007 general election. He subsequently stood as an independent candidate at that election but was not elected. National politics Harte joined the Labour Party in 2010 and was that party's candidate for the 2011 general election for Donegal North-East, where he was unsuccessful in winning a seat. Harte was subsequently elected to Seanad √âireann on the Industrial and Commercial Panel in April 2011. He became the Labour Party Seanad spokesperson on Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation.

It later transpired the article was mistranslated from Polish. After it became apparent the article Harte was talking about was mistranslated many people took to Twitter to question him about his opinion. In response Harte began to insult various users. He also accused some users of being xenophobic against Donegal while at the same time accusing other users of being \\"D4 types\\" in a derogatory manner. He later removed his comments, though accepted full responsibility for them. Health In the early hours of 16 November 2013, Harte was found unconscious at Newmarket Square, Dublin with severe head injuries, having suffered a fall. He was taken to Beaumont Hospital and put in an induced coma, and underwent surgery for a fractured skull and brain trauma. He had attended the Ireland‚ÄìLatvia soccer friendly at the Aviva Stadium some hours earlier. In late November 2013, he moved his hand. In January 2014, Harte was transferred back to Beaumont Hospital in a critical condition. Harte resigned from the Seanad on 23 September 2015, and underwent rehabilitative care for 2 years.

The event was unrelated to slavery and began after the seizure of the merchant ship Maria and her captain at Johanna Island. The United States Navy sent a sloop-of-war to free the captain, who was still being held, and to demand compensation for the incident. When Sultan Selim refused, the Americans briefly bombarded the island's fortifications.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F14F93F55147B93C6A91789D85F468584F9http://www.history.navy.mil/special%20highlights/pirates/Suppression%20of%20Piracy%20on%20Johanna%20Island,%20August%201851,%20Amerman,%20USMC%20HD.pdf Expedition In April 1850, the whaler named Maria, of New Bedford, Massachusetts, under a captain named Moores, was one of many American ships that used Johanna city as a port for resupplying before heading back out to sea. While doing so, the captain and his crew were seized by the Johannans and the ship was captured. When word reached American naval forces, conducting anti-slavery operations off Africa, Captain William Pearson, of the sixteen gun sloop proceeded to Johanna. It was August 6, 1851 when the Dale arrived off of Matsamudu, the principle port. The place was defended by a fort at one side of town and a blockhouse on the other. First Captain Pearson warned the British naval forces and civilians in the area of his intentions and then he told the same to American merchantmen on Johanna. After this, Pearson demanded that the sultan release Moores and pay $20,000. This was impossible as the coffers on the island were nearly empty. The sultan had to disregard Captain Pearson's demand of so much money and first offered $500 in cash and another $500 worth of bullocks and trinkets. Captain Pearson refused and he moored his ship directly in front of the port, 100 yards from the beach, with eight guns facing the fortifications. Bombardment of Johanna A vintage French map of Johanna which is also known as Anjouan. The natives of the island became alarmed so Sultan Selim offered $5,000 in cash, cattle, trinkets and whatever he could find. Pearson never expected to receive the full $20,000 so he gave himself twenty-four hours to decide while the sultan gathered his resources. The Americans also warned the Johannans that if they did anything warlike, or failed to evacuate the women and children during the twenty-four-hour period, the deal would be void and the Dale would immediately begin a bombardment. However, the Johannans soon after revealed their intentions of ignoring the demands of Captain Pearson when they marched a large body of soldiers into the town. Consequently, at 9:00 am on August 6, 1851, USS Dales 12- and 32-pound cannons fired on the enemy fort, which responded by firing six shots before a white flag was raised. USS Dale then stopped her attack and Selim issued another letter to the captain stating that he wished very much that the bombardment would stop. Because Captain Pearson was not sure whether to resume the engagement, he sent Lieutenant Reginald Fairfax, in a launch with marines, to inquire about what the white flag was for and if they were ready to pay. When Fairfax reached the Johannans, he asked them about the flag and said that if it was not removed, the Dale would fire anyway. The natives apparently refused to take the flag down so the Americans eventually resumed their fire on the fort before redirecting it at the blockhouse. Pearson ordered his men to make sure their shots were well aimed as he did not want any stray rounds to land within the civilian areas; only military structures were damaged. After expending a total of thirty-nine shot and shell from eight guns, over the course of about an hour, the Dale ceased firing again and sent Lieutenant Fairfax back to shore. Shortly thereafter, the lieutenant returned with Captain Moores and $1,000 from the sultan. Selim offered to surrender the town, give away all of his houses, slaves, cattle and money to try and stop the attack, he also said he was very sorry for the capture of the Maria and would not do anything like it again. Hoping to avoid bloodshed, Captain Pearson accepted the agreement and signed a treaty that put the United States among the island's most favored trading partners. Aftermath The Americans suffered no casualties in the engagement and it is unknown if any of the Johannans were hurt. USS Dale and her crew successfully extracted redress for the imprisonment of Captain Moores. Captain Pearson remained off the island for a few more weeks, but no further fighting occurred. In late August, Pearson easily suppressed a mutiny aboard the American whaler Paulina off Johanna with his detachment of twenty-seven marines and some sailors. The mutineers were taken off the ship and placed in confinement. Captain Charles R. Cutler, master of the American bark Dolphin, was at Johanna at the time of the bombardment and later he submitted a detailed account of the engagement to the New York Times.

The semi-arid grassland and plateau landscape is located south of Pinyon-juniper woodland. Vegetation in the area includes agave, common curlymesquite, dropseed, grama, prickly pear, sagebrush, sotol, and yucca. There are also examples of riparian vegetation nearby and villagers probably found douglas fir and ponderosa pine within of the site. It was likely an ideal area for agriculture due to the long growing season and plentiful water supply.Morgan, pp. 23, 33.Rose, p. 13-15.

The surface level village is dated from about 1108 [Classic period] and consists of three room blocks: the south block has 10 rooms, the east has 49 rooms and the west room block has 50 rooms or more. The East Room Block contained a sturdily built, large rectangular room () believed to have been used for community ceremonial purposes, much like the later Ancient Pueblo People round kivas.Morgan, pp. 33-34, 36. Groupings of interconnected living, work and storage rooms were generally accessed by ladder through the roof of the living room, which also contained a slab-lined hearth and in many cases metates.Morgan, p. 34. Some of the rooms, believed to signify ceremonial rooms, had dual-hearths built in benches, sunken floors lined with flagstone, and double masonry walls.Kantner, p. 121. Based upon the burial remains of the South Room Block, it was inhabited by people of prestige and status. More than 40 people's remains were found below the floor of the central room. The South Room Block also had a community room () that was built sturdily with double and triple walls. In the plazas outside the room blocks were ramadas, outdoor work areas, adobe-lined fire pits, middens, and a cremation area. There were also several pit-houses. Based upon tree-ring dating, construction continued through 1128. Construction materials and techniques in the 12th century were less reliable and methodical, with poorer quality adobe and rock, that resulted in irregular shaped rooms. Between 1130 and 1150, people left the Mimbres valley and did not return to their previous settlements, marking the end of the Mimbres Classic period.Morgan, pp. 33-34. Due to the similarity of dental remains of the people of NAN Ranch and the later people of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Desert, the NAN Ranch inhabitants who vacated the Mimbres Valley may have moved south to the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts and helped to populate the Casa Grande center.Kantner, p. 143. =Four housing types= Four types of housing were found in the NAN Ranch Three Circle phase community. The first was the single-family household which had living rooms for a family. The next housed extended family members with shared work, storage and ceremonial rooms. Larger room blocks, the third tier, consisted of several extended families. The last is the village. The housing groupings became more complex to efficiently support agriculture and maintain extended family relationships and rights.Shafer, pp. 88-89. Economy Local animals of use to prehistoric human populations, when the site was occupied, including: jackrabbits, cottontails, rats, mice, roadrunners, doves, hawks, and various reptiles. The animals found in the higher elevations included: bear, elk, black bear, grizzly bear, wolf, rattlesnake, golden eagle.Shafer, p. 4. They also gathered or cultivated maize, common bean, squash, goosefeet, pigweed, sunflower, walnut, and pinon nuts.Shafer, p. 119. As the community grew and had greater reliance on cultivation of food like maize and squash, there was need for better water management systems, such as canals and reservoirs. This was likely the precipitating factor in the transition of remote pit-houses to the centralized NAN Ranch village for the man-power to build and support the irrigation systems.Rose, pp. 1, 18-20. Maize was ground with manos and metates. Cooking pots were used to prepare food. These processing tools were present during the San Francisco Phase and increased in complexity and use during the Three Circle Phase due to greater dependency upon maize. Surplus food was stored in storage pits and granaries. Care was taken to prevent spoiling or consumption by rodents, such as placing seeds and food in jars and storage pits.Shafer, pp. 122-123. Material goodsPottery and artwork= Mimbres‚Äô culture is characterized by ceramic bowls and vessels with red on white with later black on white with paintings of animals, humans and pictures of scrolls.Shafer, pp. 38-43, 176, 181. NAN Ranch burials showed that 75 percent of pottery was initially used for cooking and preparing food but ultimately used for burial items.Shafer, p. 138. The pottery found at the NAN Ranch site was largely their own, less than 1% of the pottery remnants found were attained through trade.Minnis, p. 171. The NAN Ranch social order includes gender, labor organization, and the role of power that is displayed in the art and pottery. Women are identified in art work by presence of apron with strings hanging from the waist. The apron-wearers were the child care givers, made pottery (like bowls and vessels) and engaged in carrying hunted animals. From the artwork, men wore three different types of hair styles, made baskets, farmed, gathered food, and fished. Women were often pictured alone, while the men were always in groups. Ceremonial imagery - assumed to signify authority, status, and knowledge - had more men than women. An individual with several material possessions is to be thought of in high rank while others are of lower rank. The material possessions were likely made locally as there is little evidence of a trading network among these people during the time period. Painted inside a bowl found on the site is a ceremonial headdress, like that of Aztec and Mexican culture, that features two human figures. One lies on the ground, his head severed. The other sits atop him, wearing a helmet with a head like the \\"Horned Serpent\\" and holding what appears to be the hair of the victim in one hand and yielding a weapon in the other hand. The bodies of the people are painted black, except for a band of white painted across the eyes, similar to other painted images in Mimbres pottery.Fewkes, pp. 358-359. =Other material goods= As at some other Classic Mimbres sites, a copper bell was found at the NAN Ranch, evidence of copper fabrication.Minnis, p. 166. Turquoise, commonly found at traded in the American Southwestern, was found in small quantities of raw material, pendants (10), and beads (9).Minnis, p. 173. Burial There were 222 human burials excavated at NAN Ranch, about 90% of which were made indoors and below ground. The remaining 10% were outdoor burials and were mostly (90%) male. Burial practices encompassed the people's beliefs about transition from the earthly world to the Mimbres spirit world and evolved throughout the Mimbres occupation, becoming more formal and status-based.Shafer, pp. 8, 135. The males were buried with jewelry and ceramics, while the females were buried with ceramics. Artifacts found with the burial remains of a woman included unfired pottery and tools for making pottery early in the site's history, before the unique Mimbres pottery was made.Plog, p. 92 Large quantities of grave goods were often found in the burial of children. Examination of the coprolites remains provide insight into treatment of the ill at NAN ranch. A man who died about 1000 had fossilized feces, likely in his colon when he died, that provide some insight into the convalescent care he received, including high levels of willow pollen for pain, mustard pollen possibly for his digestive tract, and very finely ground corn possibly from a thin soup.Ellis, p. 445.Plog, p. 117. Likely because of their work grinding corn, women had a higher incidence of elbow joint and cervical vertebrae osteoarthritis than men. Although there were decided status levels at NAN Ranch, there was no noticeable difference in the health of the individuals. It is theorized that there was no great period of starvation, or \\"food stress\\", during the Classic Mimbres period sites, including the NAN Ranch. There was evidence of anemia - caused by a low-iron, low-protein maize diet or parasites - due to the incidence of porotic hyperostosis (36.5%), pitting of the cranial bones, and cribra orbitalia (19.2%), pitting on the eye orbit walls.Schollmeyer, pp. 38-40. Analysis of teeth show that the people of the community were closely related to those of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Desert. Eagle, hawk and turkey were buried in graves, covered with slabs of stone like human burials, suggesting an important role in the people's culture and beliefs. For instance, below ground of Room 12, a dual-hearth room believed to be used for ceremonial purposes, contained a bird burial near human burials.Kantner, p. 116. Excavation In 1926 and 1927, Harriet and C.B. Cosgrove and their son Burt were initial excavators at the NAN site,Shafer, pp. xxiii, 12-13. which is near their excavation project, the Swarts Ruin (1924-1927).Shafer, pp. 12-13, 17.Cosgrove and Cosgrove, p. 1 In the 1970s the Hinton family invited Harry J. Shafer of Texas A&M; University to excavate the site, which resulted in 25 years of work on the site through the 1990s.Shafer, pp. xix, xiv. Fieldwork of Mimbres culture sites conducted by University of New Mexico Mimbres Foundation and directed by Steven LeBlanc was foundational in the understanding of the Mimbres culture, including the NAN Ranch.Shafer, pp. xiv, 13.

At its height it was one of the largest and fastest- growing independent short-term finance companies in the UK. It entered Administration after a failure to reach terms on a new facility with its Bank Barclays and its Corporate Banking Director. Background The company was formed by Shaid Luqman, a British-born ethnic-Pakistani student at the University of Manchester, who studied finance. He bought his first house during his studies, striking a deal with the university's accommodation agency. This enabled him to approach banks refinancing, and by the time of his graduation in 1991 owned a portfolio of 24 flats and houses, which he rented out to fellow students. History In 2000 Luqman secured a loan of ¬£2.5m from Barclays Bank to form Pearl Holdings. The company provided bridging loan- finance to high-net-worth individuals to build property portfolios, focusing mainly on projects which converted offices and hotels into flats. Providing agreed finance against a surveyor-agreed valuation of the final project, the company would lend within 24 hours. The loan would remain in place until project financing could be provided by a long-term lender. Renamed Lexi Holdings plc in 2003,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9150658/Barclays- apologises-to-FSA-after-imposing-swaps-secrecy-clause-on-customers.html clients included MP's and footballers.

She served as the regent of Lippe during the minority of her son from 1802 to 1820. She is regarded as one of the most important rulers of Lippe. On 1 January 1809, she abolished serfdom by princely decree. She managed to keep the principality independent during the Napoleonic Wars. She wrote a constitution, in which the power of the estates was reduced. In the collective historical consciousness of the Lippe population, however, she is best remembered for her social goals. Influenced by French reformist writings, she founded the first day care center in Germany, a labor school for neglected children, a voluntary work camp for adult charity recipients and a health care institution with first aid center.  Life  Ballenstedt Castle Pauline with her sons, Frederick and Leopold (right) Pauline was born in Ballenstedt, the daughter of Prince Frederick Albert, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg of Anhalt-Bernburg and his wife Louise Albertine of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂n. A few days after her birth, her mother died of the measles. She had an elder brother, Alexius Frederick Christian (1767‚Äì1834), who was Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg from 1807. It was noticed at an early age that Pauline had an alert mind. Her father, Prince Frederick Albert personally took over the upbringing of his daughter Pauline and his son and heir Alexei. She was a good student and learned French in addition to Latin, history and political sciences. Already at 13 years of age, she assisted her father in the business of government. First she took over the French correspondence, and later the entire correspondence between the residence in Ballenstedt Castle and the government offices in Bernburg. Her education was strongly influenced by Christian ethics and the ideas of the Enlightenment. Later Pauline continued to practice what she had learned in her youth, such as the teachings of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. On 2 January 1796 Princess Pauline of Anhalt-Bernburg married Prince Leopold I of Lippe. The wedding was celebrated in Ballenstedt, and on 21 January 1796 the couple returned to Detmold, under great cheers of the population. Leopold of Lippe had been asking for her hand for years, but Pauline had repeatedly rejected his suits. The marriage took place only after Leopold's health improved. Previously, he had been put under guardianship for a short time because of mental confusion. In the following years, Pauline spoke positively about their marriage and her \\"loving\\" husband. She confessed in a letter to her trusted cousin Frederick Christian of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Augustenburg: Pauline gave birth to two sons, Leopold (born November 6, 1796) and Frederick (born December 8, 1797). A third child, a girl named Louise, died shortly after birth on 17 July 1800. Leopold I died on 4 April 1802 and on 18 May Pauline took up the regency for her minor son, the later prince Leopold. In the marriage contract between Leopold and Pauline from 1795, it had been agreed that Pauline, as the future mother, should take both the guardianship and the regency of a minor prince. The Estates of Lippe fiercely opposed this rule. However, no appropriate male guardian was available and Pauline had also already demonstrated that she would be a suitable regent. Her reign lasted nearly two decades, and is regarded as a happy chapter in the history of Lippe. Pauline held from 1818 until her death in 1820 the office of Mayor of Lemgo, overlapping the period she ruled Lippe. After the Napoleonic Wars, the city was heavily indebted. When mayor Overbeck died in 1817, no suitable new mayor could be found, and the magistrates and citizens decided on 4 January 1818 to ask Pauline ... to take a period the police and financial posts of the government of the city under her immediate direction for a period of six years .... Pauline answered on the same day and, contrary to everyone's expectations, she accepted the invitation. Locally, she was represented by the talented and dedicated lawyer Kestner, acting as Commissioner. She managed to improve the financial and social situation by taking some unpopular measures, but always with respect for the parliamentary rules of the city. Like in Detmold in 1801, she founded a workhouse for the poor and a service club under her own direction. The Lippehof in Lemgo, now the Engelbert Kaempfer-Gymnasium She planned to retire to the Lippehof, a baroque palace built in Lemgo in 1734, but she died on 29 December 1820, a few months after she had handed over government business to her son Leopold II on 3 July 1820.  Character, personality and theory of government  In comparison with her contemporary Queen Louise of Sweden Pauline has in the historic context not been glorified as idealistic. She held her position publicly and privately, and often reacted quite violently when she disagreed. This led to quite a few angry and ironic commentaries during her lifetime.Internetportal Westf√§lische Geschichte - Pauline zu Lippe, viewed on 21 April 2010 Her biographer Hans Kiewning has described her as the regent of Lippe, who was far superior to all those around her, who would also have been an unusual phenomenon in a larger context. The historian Heinrich von Treitschke called her \\"one of the cleverest women of her time. Her contemporary Ferdinand Weerth described her in his sermons as Princely in her whole being, an unusual degree of mental strength, the clear light mind, [...] and her tireless work. Pauline was challenging her two sons, especially Leopold, the heir apparent. She carefully selected teachers, however, she considered herself to be too impatient in dealing with their sons, which sometimes led to violent confrontations. The Prince and the state government had to agree with the Estates, the nobility as landowners and representatives of the cities, on important political issues. Before Pauline's rule, the sovereign, the government and the Estates had usually been able to work out a compromise, despite their often conflicting interests. Pauline, however, was accustomed to the absolute monarchy as practiced in Anhalt-Bernburg, where the Prince ultimately takes the decision. She did not want to allow the Estates to talk her out of realizing her well-intentioned social plans. She felt that she knew what was best for the country and its inhabitants. In 1805, the Estates rejected her plan to introduce a tax on liquor to finance a hospital for the insane. After that, she rarely summoned the Estates and mostly ruled by decree.Tobias Arand: F√ºrstin Pauline zur Lippe, in: Adelheid M. von Hauff (ed.): Frauen gestalten Diakonie, vol. 2: Vom 18. Jahrhundert bis zum 20. Jahrhundert, Stuttgart, 2006, p. 62 ff The government of Lippe had been presided by a chancellor or prime minister since the 18th century. Their weight grew over time. They rarely came into conflict with Princess Pauline, since their reform ideas of both sides were largely compatible with hers. Pauline regularly participated in meetings of the cabinet or the parliament and made her decisions there. Such sessions were often dominated by her impatience and her desire to lead. Her main focus was on foreign policy, however, because she spoke and wrote better French than any of her officials. She broke through the male monopoly, which in those days was only possible due to her Princely rank. No other females were active in the Lippe government, until some female Councillors were elected after 1945. She took over the foreign ministry in 1810 and in 1817 the Princess also took up the management of the \\"madhouse\\" (as it was called at the time), the house of correction and the distribution of subdidies. In the relationship to her subjects, she was often close to the people, but ultimately, she had an autocratic style of government.  Social Policies  The publications of Count Rumford Pauline inspired to put into practice her ideas on the state organization of the poor relief. She believed the cause of poverty and begging in her country was mainly to be found in the Lippe national character with his penchant for laziness and idleness. From the scientific literature on poor relief available to her, she gathered that real improvement could only be achieved through labor, voluntary or otherwise, and not through financial handouts. Inspired by this, Pauline continued the policies introduced by her late stepmother-in-law Casimire of Anhalt-Dessau, (1749‚Äì1778), in accordance with the socio-political beliefs of their time. Among the institutions founded by Pauline were a vocational school (1799), a day care center (1802), the hospital (1801‚Äì1802), the voluntary workhouse (1802). An orphanage already existed since 1720, and a teacher training college had been founded in 1781. She grouped these six institutions under the term nursing homes and housed them in a former convent. They formed the nucleus of today's Princess Pauline Foundation in Detmold. The nursing home claimed that they could provide assistance \\"from the cradle to the grave\\". It was considered unique and was often visited by foreign guests, who praised especially the day care center. The services were, however, only available to residents of Detmold. Library of Lippe Detmold The people liked Pauline mainly because of her social institutions. The integrated charitable institutions were viewed as a model at home and abroad and were visited by foreign delegations, most of them British. Her care for the poor was evident. She relieved the famine in the years 1802 to 1804, by creating granaries. She was personally responsible for the softening the impact of military activities, such as quarterting and positioning of troops. She was also responsible for the improvement of the infrastructure of the country. She built new roads and introduced street lighting in Detmold, using 26 oil lamps. She did not build any important monuments herself, but the construction of the neo-classical houses on the avenue in Detmold began during her reign. She initiated the merger in 1819 of several existing collections of books into a public library. Today's Lippe State Library at Detmold is a direct continuation of this library. Vocational School In the summer of 1798, Pauline had turned to the social tasks. There was great poverty in Lippe and the Princess accepted that this was due to a lack of education of the population. Many parents did not sent their children to school out of economic necessity, instead letting the children work or beg. Simon Ernst Moritz Kr√ºcke, the inspector of the teacher seminary, was Pauline's closest advisor on social questions. He recommended the establishment of a vocational school; children should learn the theoretical knowledge but also practical skills. Leopold I agreed and the new school was opened in the orphanage at Bruchtor in Detmold. There, Kr√ºcke taught the children of poor people together with the orphans. Legally, the school became equivalent to an elementary school. Some of the lesson was filled with practical work. Among the practical skills taught was knitting. The Princess visited knitting classes and gave small rewards to the children. The knitted goods were sold and the children received a part of the proceeds. This was meant to counter the objections of the parents, who would rather send their children to beg. A year later, the school was handed over to the country during a school festival. It was officially inaugurated on 28 June 1799. Sixty children who had not attended school before this school began, showed the knowledge and skills they had acquired in that year. Nevertheless, problems continued with parents who sent their children to the field in summer, to herd cattle or gather ears of corn, or sent them begging during the Christmas season. Economic conditions were harsh; the parents' income was never secure; the economy was evolving into a money economy and this made it difficult for them to do without the money earned by their children even seasonally.  Day care center  Map of Detmold around 1660 Pauline worried about the welfare of small children, whose parents had to leave the house for work during the day. She read in a Paris newspaper of an initiative by Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was still First Consul of France at that point in time. In Paris, however, only unmarried mothers were allowed to use the center, while in Detmold, the offering was also to married couples, if they both had to work. A circular from Princess Pauline Detmold ladies with the title (\\"Proposal to transplant is a Parisian fashion to Detmold\\") is viewed as a starting point for the creation of a day care center: Pauline used the circular to find educated ladies willing to supervise the center one day each week, for free. The princely house would finance the center. Older girls from the vocational school and the orphanage would look after the children and be trained to care for them. In 1801, Pauline purchased a suitable building for the institution: the so-called \\"Schwalenberg Court\\" on S√ºsterstra√üe (now called Sch√ºlerstra√üe) in Detmold. The first day care center opened on 1 July 1802. The building was a three-story noble court; it was demolished at the end of the 19th century. The \\"Gymnasium Leopoldinum\\" (a secondary school, which still exists) developed from a school that was already housed in the building when Pauline bought it. The day care center was soon imitated all over Germany. The city of Detmold, however, saw the project as a royal hobby and provided no financial support. Up to 20 children were cared for in the first years. They were required to have been weaned from their mother's breast of and no older than four years of age. Four-year-old children, it was believed, could stay at home alone or accompany their parents in the gardens or the fields, until they were old enough to go to the vocational school. The child-care institution was open from 24 June until late October when the harvest and garden work were completed. Based on a report published by inspector Kr√ºcke in 1813, the center was open from 06:00 to 18:00 or 20:00. In the morning adolescent girls from the orphanage and older pupils from the vocational school would wash the children and put on a clean shirt and woolen jackets. On weekends, the clothing worn during the week was washed. The clothes were donated to the children when center closed at the end of the season. Pauline mostly financed the center using her own money, and the rest was paid out of the hospital fund. She managed to find twelve wealthy middle class women willing to act as supervisors. They had to record certain events in a journal, so that the princess was always well informed.  Napoleon and Pauline  Karl Friedrich Reinhard There are numerous indications that Pauline admired Napoleon. She was grateful for allowing Lippe to remain independent. Pauline was reinforced in her opinion by her correspondence with the highly educated diplomat Karl Friedrich Reinhard, who was in the service of France and was a friend of Goethe. Reinhard was an enthusiast for the French Revolution and was ambassador at the court of the Kingdom of Westphalia in Kassel. Until the end, Pauline believed in that Napoleon would win the war. The news of Napoleon's defeat in Russia could not change their beliefs. She was opposed to Lippe seceding from the Confederation of the Rhine and Lippe prosecuted soldiers who had deserted from Napoleon's army. The Prussian lieutenant Haxthausen, who worked as a Russian diplomat, had behaved unduly toward her. She responded by having him locked up in the madhouse. He could only be released when Lippe was declared a hostile country after the Battle of Leipzig and was occupied by Prussian troops. The Prussian commander, Colonel von der Marwitz, described the incident in a letter to his wife and wrote about Pauline: The Princess- Regent is a rascal, and she has always served Napoleon faithfully [...].  Confederation of the Rhine  The Confederation of the Rhine in 1808 French Emperor Napoleon I Next to Pauline's for social reform, the preservation of the Lippe's independence was her greatest foreign policy success. She felt obliged, as guardian, to act in her son's best interest and to keep his rights intact as far as possible. The small country was wedged between the warring powers France, Prussia and Hesse and under threat of being occupied by one or the other of its neighbors. At the beginning of her reign, Lippe was part of a neutral protection zone established by treaty, which all the warring parties respected. To ensure the neutrality, Prussian observation troops of there were stationed in Lippe. In 1806 Napoleon initiated the so-called Confederation of the Rhine. Prussia responded with the North German Confederation and solicited members. Pauline saw that Lippe's independence was threatened and sought to join the Confederation of the Rhine. Napoleon confirmed Lippe's affiliation with the Confederation on 18 April 1807 with a certificate, and Pauline traveled to Paris to negotiate some special arrangements for Lippe. She was known as an admirer of Napoleon, an attitude that earned her much criticism later. In justifying her decision, she stated that she preferred to submit to a distant France than to neighboring Hesse or Prussia. The inclusion in the Confederation of the Rhine had the consequence that Lippe had to provide troops for Napoleon's army. The citizens of Lippe resisted and there were riots. Many young men evaded the recruitment or deserted during the French campaigns. After Napoleon's defeat in October 1813 in the Battle of Leipzig, the citizens of Lippe flogged the French officials in Lippe, to Pauline's dismay. Until then she had believed in Napoleon's victory. Lippe was occupied by the Prussians, who regarded it as a hostile country and as Pauline as a collaborator. As a result, Lippe resigned from the Confederation of the Rhine. Counsellor Preuss signed treaties of alliance with Austria and Russia on 29 November 1813. A Lippe volunteer corps was formed and was equipped by donations from Lippe citizens. Pauline invited her citizens to contribute and every gift, regardless of size, was published with the name of the donor in the newspaper of record.F√ºrstlich-Lippisches Intelligenzblatt 1814 Nr. 2 That Lippe came out of the political disaster of 1813 intact, was due to the tendency of the rulers in Austria and Russia to restore the . The South German members of the Confederation had been accepted as allies and it was felt that Lippe could not be treated differently. After these, Pauline suffered a nervous breakdown from which she recovered only slowly. She therefore took no part in the Congress of Vienna 1814‚Äì15, when Europe was reorganized after the victory over Napoleon. Many small states disappeared from the map, but Lippe's sovereignty was confirmed at the Congress of Vienna. The last entry in the list of sovereign princes in the preamble of the constitution of the German Confederation of 8 July 1815 reads:  Abolition of serfdom  On 27 December 1808, Princess Pauline issued a decree to abolish serfdom in Lippe, against the will of the Estates, who had been side-lined since 1805. The decree came into force on 1 January 1809. She followed the example of most other states from the Confederation of the Rhine. In the era after the French Revolution, serfdom was widely seen as a \\"relic of the Middle Ages\\", and firmly rejected. In the preamble to the decree, the Princess Regent, explained her humanistic and, above all, economic motives. Her words were read from the pulpits and published through posters and printed in the : The decree of 27 December 1808 abolished the and rules, which had been applied until then. The WeinkaufThe word has nothing to do with wine. It is derived from Winkop, a Low German word for \\"profit\\". rule stipulated that when a serf sold his (his right to use a certain parcel of land), a transfer fee had to be paid to the landlord. Under the Sterbfall rule, when a serf died, his heirs had to deliver his best set of clothes or his or the most valuable piece of cattle (the so-called to the landlord. This Regulation initially affected only Paulines own serfs and their relatives. Within a short time, however, it was extended to the landed gentry, the landowners, the Church of Lippe and the wealthy citizens. This gave the Lippe farmers and their families a noticeable improvement of their previously modest social status. However, the Lippe variant of serfdom was by no means comparable with the Prussian or the Russian serfdom. It was only a mild obligation and its abolition posed no particular event and sparked no celebrations among those affected. The farmers were more hindered by the numerous banalities and payments in cash and in kind they were required to make, which would only be abolished by law in Lippe in the 1830.  Constitutional dispute  The Estates were made up of representatives of the knighthood and the cities and convened each year at a Landtag in order to discuss the affairs of Lippe and to make decisions. With the membership of Lippe in the Confederation of the Rhine, these rights were suspended and the Princess was appointed to Sovereign. Pauline took her new authority to the mean that she would no longer need the consent of the Estates now: Pauline did not resolved the Estates but largely ruled without them, like the absolutist Frederick Adolph a century earlier. Her relationship to the Estates had already been tarnished when the Estates refused the duty on spirits that she had proposed in 1805 to finance the asylum for the insane she was planning. After the Confederation of the Rhine was dissolved, the Estates demanded their old rights be reinstated and it came to a bitter dispute with the Princely House. Draft constitution, handwritten by Princess Pauline in 1819 In the Vienna Final Act, the final document of the Congress of Vienna, paragraph 13 states: In all German states will a Constitution of the Estates will be established [...]. Pauline had a Constitution for Lippe drafted along the lines of some southern German states; she wrote the final version personally. This Constitution was adopted by the Government on 8 June 1819 and subsequently published under cheers of the population.Constitutional charter of the estates of principality of Lippe 1819 The Estates protested against the restriction of their traditional rights and asked the Emperor to counter the Princess's subversive and the democratic spirit of the times.Hans Kiewning: Hundert Jahre lippische Verfassung 1819-1919, Detmold, 1935 At the instigation of Metternich, the so-called Carlsbad Decrees were taken against democratic agitation. These coincided with the bitter confrontation about the Constitution in Lippe. The Federal Assembly of the German Confederation asked Pauline to immediately repeal the Constitution. After Pauline's death, Leopold II and the Lippe government tried to maintain her Legacy, with the necessary changes. After long and difficult negotiations with the estates, including the nobility, this proved impossible. Eventually a compromise was found in which some of the ancient privileges of the nobility were restored. The new Constitution came into force in 1836.  Resignation  Pauline was often disappointed by Leopold and believed she could not hand over government to him with clear conscience. She postponed the date of the transfer several times, until critical voices became too loud. Finally, she surprised her son by announcing her resignation on 3 July 1820. At first, Leopold needed her assistance in the affairs of government, but he made sure that this was not visible to outsiders. Pauline planned to end this situation by moving from Detmold to her widow seat Lippehof at Lemgo. However, before she could move, she died at Detmold on 29 December 1820 of a painful lung ulceration. She was buried in the Reformed Church at the market square in Detmold, today's Church of the Redeemer. On 5 March 1822 an obituary of Pauline by Helmina von Ch√©zy was published in the . It condemned her anti-Prussian policy and cited as an excuse:  Reception  Pauline monument in Bad Meinberg Memorial plaque on the Castle Square in Detmold The historian Hans Kiewning wrote a biography of Pauline in the 1930s entitled: Princess Pauline of Lippe, 1769 to 1820. It is the most influential positive biography until today. Kiewning expressed his admiration for Pauline in the following words: Pauline's personality, politics and reforms have been the subject of numerous studies and publications. The Lippe Bibliography lists some 170 titles are currently only about personal. Historical research in the second half of the 20th century began to question the uncritical historical view of Pauline. Elizabeth Stolle asked in her contribution to Lippischen Mitteilungen aus Geschichte und Landeskunde, 1969 questions about the Pauline's religious stance, in order to obtain a better understanding of her diaconal interests. In a survey conducted by the at the end of 2009, Princess Pauline was elected as the most significant figure in the history of Lippe, with 28 percent of the votes cast. Former state president Heinrich Drake finished second with 22 percent, the third place was tied between Arminius, winner of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, and ex- Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, with 9 percent of the votes each. Statues of Pauline can be found on the grounds of the Lindenhaus in Lemgo and in park of Bad Meinberg. A plaque is attached to a building at the Castle Square in Detmold. An association name Pauline's daughters, a mineral spring at Bad Salzuflen name Pauline spring, and a number of street names in several towns in Lippe, all remind us of the Princess. The Princess Pauline Foundation in Detmold still exists and focusses on assisting young people and the elderly. The foundation runs a number of day care centers and strives help people in need in the spirit of the Princess.Princess Pauline Foundation, viewed on 12 April 2010  Issue  *Leopold II, Prince of Lippe (6 November 1796 - 1 January 1851) *Prince Frederick (8 December 1797 - 20 October 1854) *Princess Louise (17 July 1800 - 18 July 1800) Titles and styles=Titles and styles * 23 February 1769 ‚Äì 2 January 1796: Her Serene Highness Princess Pauline of Anhalt-Bernburg * 2 January 1796 ‚Äì 5 November 1802: Her Serene Highness The Princess of Lippe * 5 November 1802 ‚Äì 29 December 1820: Her Serene Highness The Dowager Princess of Lippe ** 5 November 1802 ‚Äì 3 July 1820: Her Serene Highness The Regent of Lippe AncestryFootnotesReferences and Sources * * * , also available via Google * * * * * * *  External links  * * Princess Pauline Foundation (in German) * Online- Biography of Pauline of Lippe (in German) Category:1769 births Category:1820 deaths Category:19th-century German people Category:19th-century women rulers Psuline Category:Princesses of Lippe Category:House of Lippe ","title":"Princess Pauline of Anhalt-Bernburg"},{"id":"31624640","text":"The Clifton T.

When one encodes a memory, they not only record sensory data (such as visual or auditory data), they also store their mood and emotional states. An individual's present mood thus affects the memories that are most easily available to them, such that when they are in a good mood they recall good memories (and vice versa). The associative nature of memory also means that one tends to store happy memories in a linked set. Unlike mood-congruent memory, mood-dependent memory occurs when one's current mood resembles their mood at the time of memory storage, which helps to recall the memory. Thus, the likelihood of remembering an event is higher when encoding and recall moods match up. However, it seems that only authentic moods have the power to produce these mood-dependent effects.  Theories of emotion  Mood is the state or quality of feeling at a particular time. When attempting to discover the biological factors that influence mood, it is difficult to find scientific proofs. The psychological study of mood is built on theories. However, much has been discovered in the study of the brain. The following are a few theories and areas of study of the mind used to further our knowledge of the mind. Somatic theories See also Somatic theories Somatic theories of emotion claim that bodily responses are essential to emotions, rather than judgements. In the 1880s, William James provided the first modern version of such theories. The James‚ÄìLange theory, seen by many as his masterwork, lost favor in the 20th century, but has regained popularity more recently due largely to theorists such as John Cacioppo, Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio, Joseph E. LeDoux and Robert Zajonc who are able to appeal to neurological evidence. Neurobiological theories See also Neurobiological theories Based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the limbic system, the neurobiological explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian brain. If distinguished from reactive responses of reptiles, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general vertebrate arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures, and postures. This hypothesis that synaptic plasticity is an important part of the neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory is now widely accepted. Cognitive theories See also Cognitive theories In cognitive psychology, the human mind is seen to be a structured system for handling information. Several theories argue that cognitive activities such as judgments, evaluations, or thoughts are necessary for an emotion to occur. Richard Lazarus argues this by saying it is necessary to capture the fact that emotions are about something or have intentionality. Such cognitive activity may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing. Written in 1958, Donald Eric Broadbent's Perception and Communication was the first book entirely devoted to human information processing. This book introduced the notion of several distinct kinds of storage systems (memories) of limited capacity and of attention as a mechanism for filtering incoming information.  Internal versus external events  Internal events occur in the human mind. These occurrences of cognition are visible only to the person who experiences them. External events are physical occurrences experienced in a human's environment, such as receiving a gift or encountering a friend. External events affect the mood of an individual depending on how he or she perceives the action. Some evidence suggests that internal events, such as imagination and reasoning, are less likely than external events to be remembered after a mood shift. Eich and Metcalfe conducted several experiments on this subject. Each experiment was composed of an encoding session and a retrieval session. Subjects were asked to describe their current mood, and then listened to classical music chosen to instigate either happiness or sadness. As they listened to the music, subjects again expressed how they were feeling to keep their minds working. The researchers came to several conclusions from this study. They found that events are generated through internal processes that are more connected to one's mood than to external processes. Although the source of an event seems to play a part in the occurrence of mood dependent memory, it is not the only relevant factor. In addition, memories vary in terms of the manner in which retention is measured. The strength and stability of moods that impair memory must meet two conditions: the mood shift must be substantial, and the mood at the start must be the same when it ends in encoding or retrieval. The relationship between mood and arousal is also important: if mood is dependent on arousal, then mood corresponds to a subjective state which describes mood dependent memory.  Mood congruence versus mood dependence  There is a definitive difference in mood congruence and mood dependence. Lewis and Critchley discuss the difference in these memory effects. Mood congruence is when one can match an emotion to a specific memory. Mood dependence, on the other hand, is the sorting of memory when mood at retrieval is the same as encoding. After using others' research, Lewis and Critchley came to the conclusion that there is neural basis for the influence of mood at encoding and that this influence at the base relates to activity of emotion specific regions of the brain. One model they propose is the semantic network approach, which suggests that 'emotion-specific memory nodes connect many related aspects of an emotion, such as autonomic responses, expressive behaviours, and description of situations that might evoke the emotion'. Within this model, two assumptions may be made: remembering certain information while in a specific mood leads to responsiveness in the emotional system that corresponds to that particular mood and mood at retrieval influences ones' emotions. This relates to mood- dependent memory because it may suggest that ones' mood at encoding could become associated with neutral information. It may also imply the activity of emotions, triggered by mood at retrieval, could propagate to the nodes with the same mood at encoding. Lewis and Critchley, however, state that the semantic-network approach is weak for three reasons. First, though emotions retrieve past information, one cannot decipher between positive and negative moods in this particular approach. Second, it is unclear as to whether positive and negative moods at recall lead to activity in a positive or negative way in the emotions. Lastly, researchers cannot prove that emotional activity due to mood could interact with emotional activity associated with remembrance. For these reasons, the semantic-network approach is not as reliable as researchers would have hoped.  Music-dependent memory  Music- dependent memory is an effect of mood-dependent memory. There have been many studies conducted that have suggested that the music one listens to may affect their mood. In Balch and Lewis‚Äô article, they studied how the participants‚Äô moods were affected by the change in tempo of a musical piece. The participants were each given a list of words to read while music played in the background, with varying tempos distributed randomly. The participants were then asked to recall all the words they had read previously. Balch and Lewis found that the participants were able to remember more words when the tempo did not change. This same experiment was composed in different ways: with a change in timbre, a different song playing, or silence with no music at all. However, none of these experiments returned results suggesting that changing the different aspects of music affected the memory of participants, indicating that change in tempo seemed to be the only thing that influenced the participants‚Äô memories. There is still much research being done concerning music-dependent memory.

Following extensive modifications, in 1935, as Saint Columba, she took over the \\"Royal Route\\" from Glasgow to Ardrishaig until scrapped in 1958. History TS Queen Alexandra was built in 1912 by William Denny and Brothers, Dumbarton for Turbine Steamers Ltd, to replace a previous Queen Alexandra of 1902, which had been extensively damaged by fire. The new Queen was designed for the long distance cruises. Her first public sailing was on 23 May 1912 to Campbeltown. Fast and manoeuvrable, she soon became a popular boat. In 1935, her owners Turbine Steamers Ltd were sold to David MacBrayne Ltd and the turbine steamers and Queen Alexandra transferred to the Western Isles. Queen Alexandra went for refit at Lamont's shipyard, where she was transformed. This was all in preparation for her new role on the \\"Royal Route\\". Her similarity to Cunard's Queen Mary earned her the nickname \\"MacBrayne's little Cunarder\\". Withdrawn after 48 years of sterling service in September 1958, she was towed to Smith & Houston's shipyard in Port Glasgow on 23 December 1958 and was scrapped. Layout Queen Alexandra was the longest turbine steamer ever built for service on the Clyde and remains the only three funnelled steamer ever to have served on the Clyde. Initially open, her promenade deck was enclosed, providing shelter. In 1935, her upper deck was extended aft, a third funnel fitted and a new smoke room, called the Clachan Bar installed. She was repainted in MacBrayne colours and renamed Saint Columba. In 1937, she became the first Clyde steamer to be converted permanently to oil fuel. Service Queen Alexandra operated long distance cruises to Campbeltown and Inveraray, departing Glasgow‚Äôs Bridge Wharf at 7.11. World War I Service She was requisitioned by the Admiralty as a troop transport ship in 1915, and operated in the English Channel between England and France ferrying soldiers and war materials to supply the Western Front. During her war service she rammed and sank the German Imperial Navy's U-Boat UC-78 off of the French coast at Cherbourg on 9 May 1918.Entry on the site U.Boat.net for the war career of the U-Boat UC-78 http://www.uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=uc+78 Return to cruising At the end of the war she was released by the Admiralty and returned to the River Clyde in 1919 and resumed her long distance cruises, most often to Inveraray. After her extensive 1935 refit, she replaced the legendary paddle steamer on the \\"Royal Route\\" from Glasgow to Ardrishaig. She gave sterling service on this route from 1935 until the outbreak of war in 1939. World War II Service During World War II, she was again requisitioned by the Admiralty and, possibly in view of her age, served as an accommodation ship in Greenock's East India Harbour. Final years She was the last Clyde steamer to be returned to peacetime duties, resuming her service from Glasgow to Ardrishaig from 1947 until 1958.

During that season, he played with the Major League Baseball (MLB) Pittsburgh Rebels of the Federal League. Kerlin appeared in three games with the Rebels, never getting a hit in one at-bat. Defensively, he played the catcher position. He batted left-handed while throwing right. During his playing career, he stood at and weighed . Before turning professional, Kerlin attended Louisiana State University. After his baseball career was over, Kerlin returned to his home-town of Homer, Louisiana and worked various jobs, including a merchant, undertaker, and president of a sawmill. Biography Orie Kerlin was born on January 23, 1891 in Summerfield, Louisiana to Marcellus L. and Mary A. Kerlin of Louisiana and Mississippi, respectively. Marcellus Kerlin worked as a merchant in a hardware store. Orie Kerlin had seven siblings: sisters Faye, Christeen, and Dorothy; and brothers William, Douglas, Brock, and Cellers. By 1900, the Kerlin family was living in Homer, Louisiana. Orie Kerlin enrolled at Louisiana State University in 1910. He left the school five years later, in 1915. Kerlin started playing baseball early in his life. The Gazette Times reported that Kerlin played semi-professional baseball Texas for a few years. They also reported that he played a few games in the Texas League. In December 1914, Kerlin was signed by the Pittsburgh Rebels of the Federal League, a newly formed circuit in Major League Baseball. Kerlin was discovered by Pittsburgh's manager, Rebel Oakes, who lived in the same town as Kerlin, Homer, Louisiana. The transaction was not officially announced until spring training in 1915. Kerlin was used as Pittsburgh's third catcher, behind Claude Berry, and Paddy O'Connor. Oakes described Kerlin as being \\"fast as lightning, a fair batter, and a half-decent catcher\\". Early in the 1915 season, Kerlin suffered an injury to his finger, causing him to miss two days of practice with the Pittsburgh Rebels. During the season, The Pittsburgh Press commented that while Kerlin showed promise as a catcher, he was just too ripe and young to receive the bulk of Pittsburgh's catching duties. Frank G. Menke of the International News Service stated that Kerlin was a \\"coming wonder\\" and that he could \\"hit, throw, and catch in big-league fashion\\". Kerlin made his MLB debut mid-season on June 6, 1915 against the Chicago Whales. His second game came on July 8, against the St. Louis Terriers. He made his final MLB appearance on September 1. Over his three games with Pittsburgh, he went hitless in one at-bat. In the field, Kerlin played all three of his games at catcher, making no errors, and allowing one passed ball. By 1920, Kerlin was living with his parents back in Homer, Louisiana. He worked at Fomby Hardware Store in Homer with his father. A few years later, Kerlin worked as the town undertaker. Kerlin also worked as the president of the local sawmill. By 1930, he was married to Lillian Kerlin of Louisiana. The Kerlins had two children, daughters June and Marthe. Kerlin died on October 29, 1974, in Corpus Christi, Texas, although some sources state he died in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was buried at Arlington Cemetery in Homer, Louisiana.

Glass jar, at the Museum of Valladolid. The Romans were pioneers in the technique of glass blowing.Throughout the centuries of Roman rule over the provinces of Hispania, Roman customs, religion, laws and the general Roman lifestyle, gained much favour in the indigenous population, which was compounded by a substantial minority of Roman immigrants, which eventually formed a distinct Hispano-Roman culture. Several factors aided the process of Romanization: :*Creation of civil infrastructure, including road networks and urban sanitation. :*Commercial interaction within regions and the wider Roman world. :*Foundation of colonia; settling Roman military veterans in newly created towns and cities. :*The spread of the hierarchical Roman administrative system throughout the Hispanic provinces. :*Growth of Roman aristocratic land holdings (latifundia). Map showing the \\"Roman coloniae\\" in Hispania, indicating that southern Spain (where were born the famous emperors Trajan, Hadrian and possibly Theodosius the Great) had the highest concentration of Italian/Roman colonists after central Italy According to historian Theodore Mommsen in the late fourth century (before the barbarian invasions) the romanization of the Iberian peninsula was practically at 100%Theodore Mommsen.The Provinces of the Roman Empire from Caesar to Diocletian. Chapter: Hispania  Roman Settlements  During 170 years of conquests, the Roman Republic slowly expanded its control over all Hispania. This was a gradual process of pacification, rather than the result of a policy of conquest. In this period, conquest was a process of assimilation of the local tribes into the Roman world and its economic system after pacification. One of the main ways of assimilation was through the settlement of Romans in the peninsula. The map showing the Roman conquest of Hispania can be used to show the settlement of Roman/Italian citizens in the Iberian peninsula: the greener the color the greater the amount of colonists who moved from the Italian peninsula. Probably in the Mediterranean area (with dark green color) the colonists -with their descendants- were nearly half the population in Augustus times The Romans deployed eight legions for the wars of conquest. Many of the veterans, who had the right to be granted a plot of land to farm on discharge, were settled in Hispania. Several Roman towns were founded: Augusta Emerita (Merida, Extremadura) in 25 BCE (it became the capital of the province of Hispania Lusitania; it was probably founded by Publius Carusius); Asturica Augusta (Astorga, province of Leon) in 14 BCE (it became an important administrative centre); Colonia Caesar Augusta or Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza, Arag√≥n) in 14 BCE; and Lucus Augusti (Lugo, Galicia) in 13 BCE (it was the most important Roman town in Gallaecia). The Roman presence had probably increased during the first century BCE as a number of Roman colonies were founded in this period: Colonia Clunia Sulpicia (in the province of Burgos, it was one of the most important Roman cities of the northern half of Hispania), C√°parra (in the north of Extremadura), Complutum (Alcal√° de Henares near Madrid). In what is now Portugal there were 5 Roman colonies (Emerita Augusta (M√©rida, Spain), Pax Iulia (Beja), Scalabis (Santar√©m), Norba Caesarina and Metellinum). Felicitas Iulia Olisipo (Lisbon, which was a Roman law municipality) and 3 other Portuguese towns had the old Latin status (Ebora (√âvora), Myrtilis Iulia (M√©rtola) and Salacia (Alc√°cer do Sal). Augustus also commissioned the via Augusta (which went from the Pyrenees all the way to Cadiz, it was 1,500 kilometres or 900 miles long).  Municipalities  Although Roman influence had a major impact on existing cities on the peninsula, the largest urban development effort focused on the new cities under construction, Tarraco (modern Tarragona), Emerita Augusta (now M√©rida) and Italica (in the present day Santiponce, near Seville). Roman towns or settlements were conceived as images of the imperial capital in miniature. The construction of public buildings was carried out by the curator operatum and were run directly by the supreme municipal magistrates. To undertake any work by public funds, authorization from the emperor was needed. Patriotism and local euergetism encouraged local cities to compete, creating more affluent neighboring municipalities. Public works undertaken with private funds were not subject to the requirement of approval of the emperor. The planners decided the space needed for the houses, plazas and temples, the volume of water required and the number and width of streets. Soldiers collaborated in the construction of the city, as well as local craftsmen together with slaves owned by patricians or equestrians. = Tarraco = Tarraco had its origin in the Roman military camp established by the two brothers, consular, Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio in 218 BC, when commanding the landing on the Iberian Peninsula during the Second Punic War. The first mention of the city is by Pliny the Elder where he characterizes the city as scipionum opus, \\"work of Scipio\\" ( Nat.Hist. III.21, and ends \\"... sicut Poenorum Carthago ). In fact, Tarraco was the capital at the outset of the Hispania Citerior during the Roman Republic, and later the very extensive Hispania Citerior Tarraconensis Province. Possibly around the year 45BC. Julius Caesar changed the status of city to a colonia, which is reflected in the epithet Iulia in its formal name: Colonia Iulia Urbs Triumphalis Tarraco, which would remain for the duration of the Empire. = Emerita Augusta = Roman Theatre at M√©rida. Emerita Augusta was founded in 25BC. by Publius Carisio, as the representative of the emperor Octavian Augustus as a resting place for troops discharged from the Legions V (Alaudae) and X (Gemina). Over time, this city became one of the most important in Hispania, capital of the province of Lusitania and an economic and cultural center. = Italica = Italica (located today where the city of Santiponce in the province of Seville stands) was the first purely Roman city founded in Hispania. After the Second Punic War, Scipio \\"Africanus\\" divided land between the Roman legions in the Betis river valley (now the Guadalquivir), so that although Italica was created as a field hospital for the wounded from the Battle of Ilipa, later it became a settlement for veterans of war and then a municipality, on the west bank of the river Betis in 206 BC. It was during the time of Caesar Augustus when Italica gained the status of municipality, with the right to issue currency, but it came to its zenith during the reigns of the Caesars Trajan and Hadrian at the end of the century and during the 2nd century. They originated from Italica, which would give great prestige to the former Spanish colony in Rome. Both emperors were particularly generous to their hometown, expanding and revitalizing its economy. Hadrian ordered the construction of the nova urbs, the new city, a city that only had slight activity over the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. Also during the reign of Hadrian, the city changed its status to become a Roman colony. It is at this time renamed Colonia Aelia Augusta Italica, in honor of the emperor. By then, the Roman Senate had an important pressure group originating from the Spanish city. = Carthago Nova = The Roman Theatre in Cartegena, currently undergoing reconstruction Founded around the year 227 BC. by the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal the Fair under the name of Qart Hadast ('New Town'). It was strategically located in a large natural harbor from which the nearby silver mines of Carthago Nova could be controlled. It was taken by the Roman general Scipio Africanus in the year 209BC. during the Second Punic War to cut off the silver going to general Hannibal . In the year 44 BC. The city would receive the title of colony under the name Colonia Iulia Urbs Nova Carthago (CVINC), founded by citizens of Roman law. Augustus in 27BC. decided to reorganize Hispania and the city was included in the new imperial province Tarraconensis, through Tiberius and Claudius, it was made the capital of conventus iuridicus Carthaginensis. During the reign of Augustus, the city was subjected to an ambitious development program which included, among other urban developments, the construction of an impressive Roman theater, the Augusteum (imperial cult building) and a forum . Later, under Emperor Diocletian, it was made the capital of the Roman Province Carthaginensis, separate from Tarraconensis  Military Projects  The military works were the first type of infrastructure built by the Romans in Hispania, due to the confrontation on the peninsula with the Carthaginians during the Second Punic War.  Camps  The Roman fort was the main focus of military strategy passive or active. They could be constructed for short term temporary occupation, tasked with some immediate military purpose, or for garrisoning the troops during the winter, in these cases is built with mortar and wood. They could also be permanent, in order to subdue or control an area in the long term, for which stone was often used to build fortifications. Many camps became stable population centers, eventually becoming real cities, as is the case of Le√≥n.  Walls  Once a developed into a stable colony or camp, the need to defend these nuclei involved the construction of powerful walls. The Romans inherited the poliorcetic tradition (siege warfare tactics) of the Greeks, and over the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, erected substantial walls, usually with the technique of double facing stones with a filling inside of mortar, stone and unique Roman concrete. The thickness of this could range from four to even ten meters. After the period of the Pax Romana these defenses were expendable, but the invasions of Germanic tribes revived the construction of walls. There are notable present day remains of Roman walls in Zaragoza, Lugo, Le√≥n, Tarragona, Astorga, C√≥rdoba, Seg√≥briga and Barcelona.  Civil Projects  Aqueduct of Segovia: one of the most extensive surviving civil works from Roman Hispania The ancient Roman civilization is known as the great builder of infrastructure. It was the first civilization which dedicated itself to a serious and determined effort for this kind of civil work as a basis for settlement of their populations, and the preservation of its military and economic domination over the vast territory of its empire. The works of most importance are roads, bridges and aqueducts.  Infrastructure  Either within or outside the urban environment, these facilities became vital for the function of the city and its economy, allowing it to supply the most essential necessities; either water via aqueducts or food, supplies and goods through the efficient network of roads. In addition, any city of at least average importance had a sewer system for the drainage of waste water and to prevent rain flooding the streets. = Roman streets and roads = Infrastructure for civilian use was built with intensity by the Romans in Hispania, Roman roads that ran through the peninsula joining Cadiz to the Pyrenees and Asturias to Murcia: covering the coastal Mediterranean and Atlantic through the already established routes. Along them a booming trade flowed, encouraging political stability of the territory over several centuries. Among these roads, the most important were: :* V√≠a Lata, now known as V√≠a de la Plata; or the Silver Way :* Via Augusta, the longest Imperial Roman road in Spain. 1500 km in length and comprising multiple sections :* V√≠a Exterior Main arterial roads of Roman Hispania. To signal distance along these routes milestones were placed, which were either columns or significant stones, and they marked the distance from the point of origin as measured by thousands of steps (miles). Currently most of these routes correspond to the layout of present day roads or highways in the states of Spain and Portugal, which confirms the renewed logic of the Roman optimal choice for their roads. = Bridges = Roman bridges, an essential complement to the roads, allowed them to overcome the obstacle posed by rivers, which in the case of the Iberian Peninsula can be very wide. Rome, faced with this geographical challenge, responded with some of the most durable and reliable constructions. Rome also built a large number of wooden bridges on minor crossings, but today the only surviving references are those made of stone. Cordoba The typical Roman bridge consisted of a platform supported by arches, semicircles or segments of circles. There are also cases of bridges over full circles. The pillars in the water include a wedge-shaped structures called abutments to redirect the flow of water, which create a pier on which the bridge itself sits. Model of the construction of a Roman abutment This successful model construction model lasted until late Middle Ages, and today it is difficult to know in some cases if some bridges are actually Roman or if they were built later to the original design. = Aqueducts = An important town needed a constant water supply for the thousands of people gathered in one place which could be sometimes several miles away from natural water source. To achieve this continuous flow of water the Romans built aqueducts. Aq√ºeducte de les Ferreres is located on the outskirts of the Roman town Tarraco. The Roman aqueducts, despite their appearances, were built mostly underground. However, they are now known as the monumental aqueducts built to bridge geographic barriers in order to give a continuous water channel. The slenderness of this type of construction, along with the tremendous height reached by some of them, makes them the most beautiful works of civil engineering of all time, especially taking into account the difficulties overcome to build them. For the construction of an aqueduct, first they needed a source of the water, channeling a natural flow through the construction of a canal, and allowing the slope to carry water through this channel to an artificial lake (in some cases a large stone reservoir structure). This ensured the constant supply of water throughout the year. Diagram of a water trap From this point, the water could be transported by canals, whether of stone, or by pipes of ceramic or lead. The latter solution would also bring about health problems such as lead poisoning, a problem that would extend almost to the present day in places where this type of water management has been used in abundance. Lead piping was more easy to work, but was used more in the urban distribution network due to its high price, as well as aqueduct traps. Model of the Aqueduct of Segovia The artificial reservoir water was transported through an underground channel to the town, often taking advantage of natural slopes, but sometimes the Romans also built traps, which allowed them to avoid a downward slope without building the famous bridges but keeping the pressure flow. These traps take advantage of the pressure resulting from the falling water to raise the other side, keeping the pressure at the expense of losing some of the flow. This is an application of the principle of communicating vessels. Current aqueducts which are notable for their condition include the first aqueduct of Segovia, which is the most famous Roman construction of the Iberian Peninsula, followed by the aqueduct in Tarragona or Devil's Bridge, and also the remains of the aqueduct of Merida, known as the Miraculous Aqueduct.  Urban works  Within the urban environment are the baths and sewers, but also remarkable buildings for leisure and culture, including theaters, circuses and amphitheaters. = Bathhouses = Diagram of a Roman bathhouse at Azaila. Roman culture worshiped the body, and therefore the health of it. The hot springs or public baths became meeting places for people from all walks of life, and their use was encouraged by the authorities, which sometimes covered their expenses which allowed free access to the population. Although men and women sometimes shared the same spaces, bath times were different for each: women came in the morning while the men did at dusk. Those available in separate sections for men and women, the separate areas devoted to them were given the name spas. Pool at the baths in Caesaraugusta In the Iberian Peninsula there is great diversity of such archaeological buildings, highlighting their conservation status such as the Baths of Alange near Merida which, after several restorations over the 18th and 19th centuries, are now open the public as part of a medicinal water spa. The Roman bath is a structure defined by its function, as shown in the schematic diagram of Azaila . The apodyterium was also the entrance to the baths, which also acted as a locker room. Then it led to another room called tepidarium which consisted of a warm room which in turn gave way to frigidarium or the caldearium rooms, hot and cold water respectively. The hot water rom caldearium was oriented to the south to receive the maximum amount of sunlight. Under the floor of this room was a series of pipes through which hot water circulated, or in smaller bathhouses they used a more residential style of hypocaust heating. The frigidarium, however, used to be an open pool of cool water. Generally, the spa is surrounded by gardens and other accessory buildings with services for visitors such as gymnasiums, libraries or other places of assembly (laconium), all with the aim of providing customers with a pleasant and invigorating environment. These springs require large numbers of staff to operate, particularly taking into account the need for large amounts of hot water, the need for materials and to properly serve customers. = Sewers = The Romans knew from the beginning of its rise as a civilization that a city must have an efficient system of waste disposal in order to grow. Hence, they built in all cities of any importance the sewage systems that still in some cases remain in their original form. In Merida, for example, the Roman sewer system has been used until recent years, and its design still serves as reference to know what was the layout of the ancient Roman city. In other cities like Le√≥n (founded as a camp of the Legio VII Gemina) are vestiges of these infrastructures and serve as an example on rainy days of a perfect drainage system to prevent flooded streets . = Theatres = Classical literature, both Greek and Roman, is full of dramas written expressly for public performance, although in reality, the Roman theater has its origins in the Etruscan foundations of their culture. It is however true that very soon assimilated the characteristics of ancient Greek tragedy and comedy.Clunia Theatre. The theater was one of the favorite leisure activities of the Hispanic-Roman, and as with other buildings of public interest, any city of renown could do without owning one. So much so that the theater of Emerita Augusta was built almost at the same time as the rest of the city by the consul Marcus Agrippa, son of the emperor Octavian Augustus. In total there are known remains of at least thirteen Roman theaters throughout the peninsula. The Roman theatre had more important activities than comedies or dramas; it was a venue for celebrations that praised the emperor, it is therefore of a more political, not leisurely nature, although on occasion it may have accommodated all kinds of cultural exhibitions. The vast wealth of theaters in Hispania has to do with the political life of cities and towns which all aspired to have its own theater and therefore solidify their status.Remains of the Roman theatre at Cesaraugusta, in modern day Zaragoza Other examples are in the city of Baelo Claudia, a city that has an impressive Roman theatre inside the fortress, occupying a huge space. Its construction in a city where only houses have been found only within the fortress, suggests the importance of this civil building: to represent the political force of the emperor. Undoubtedly, the best preserved theater in the Peninsula is to Merida, but also the theater of Italica, Sagunto, Clunia, Caesaraugusta and others are part of the archaeological record, and some even host modern theater festivals regularly: they can be considered to be fulfilling the purpose for which they were built, in some cases more than two thousand years ago. In the nineties Roman Theatre in Cartagena was discovered and currently under restoration. Roman theatre in M√©rida The reconstruction carried out on Sagunto's theater, designed by architects Giorgio Grassi and Manuel Portaceli and carried out between 1983 and 1993 is still mired in both controversy and in legal disputes. A court order requires the demolition of all the reconstruction work and for the return of the theatre to the conditions in which it was before the work was conducted. It seems unlikely however that such a sentence can be executed, since it can not guarantee the preservation of the original theatre due to the scale of the necessary demolition work. = Amphitheatres = The amphitheatre at Tarragona. Roman culture had distinct values on human life which are very different from those now prevailing in Europe and, in general, in the world. The system of slavery, made it possible for a man to lose his status as \\"free man\\" for various reasons such as: crime, debt or military defeat. After losing their rights, they were coerced into participating in a form of entertainment which today could be considered excessively brutal, but which at that time was one of the most powerful attractions of urban life: gladiatorial combat. Not only slaves or prisoners were involved in these kinds of struggles (although the vast majority of gladiators were), but some also had career as a gladiator who fought for money, favors or glory. Even some emperors occasionally ventured down to the sand to play this bloody \\"sport\\", as in the case of the emperor Commodus. The amphitheatre at It√°lica. The fight took place at first in the circus, but then the construction of amphitheatres began: elliptical buildings exclusively for the fight. The first stone amphitheater built in Rome, and the same design was later exported to major cities throughout the empire. Under the arena of the amphitheater was the pit, where gladiators and wild beasts were prepared or were locked away until the time of the fight. This pit was covered by a wooden roof on which was the scene of the fighting. Around this surface were raised elliptical arena benches where the audience attending the \\"games\\" would be situated. These arenas would also be witnesses from the 1st century onwards, of brutal repression at certain times which was exerted against the growing Christian population by the Roman authorities. Undoubtedly, the Colosseum in Rome is the best known and most monumental amphitheater in the world, but within Hispania, several were built whose remains have been preserved, such as Italica, Jerez, Tarragona and Merida.  Overview  Roman influence gradually spread across the peninsula over a prolonged period of two centuries. Many Iberian tribes were initially aggressive, opposing Roman dominion militarily, though others became allied or tributary entities increasingly reliant on Rome. Roman theatre at Seg√≥briga. The Mediterranean coast, which was inhabited before the arrival of the Romans by indigenous Iberians such as the Turdetani and Ilergetians, as well as Greek and Phoenician/Carthaginian colonies, were quick to adopt aspects of Roman culture. The first Roman cities were founded in these territories, such as Tarraco in the northeast or Italica in the south during the period of confrontation with Carthage. In the interior of the Iberian Peninsula, where Celtiberian, Cantabrian and Vasconian (Basque) cultures were well established. Constant military campaigns against the rebellious indigenous Iberians eventually pacified the Hispanic provinces, ending with the Augustan campaigns against the Cantabrians and Astures. The predominance of native Iberian culture diminished in the face of the cultural impact of Roman dominion, being assimilated and transformed gradually into the later Hispano-Roman culture. The new Hispano-Roman elite, formed of the preceding Iberian tribal elite and the growing Roman aristocracy, occupied administrative positions in the new municipal institutions and wider imperial bureaucracy, serving in judicial, military and civil offices. The expansion of Roman citizenship in the Antonine Constitution in 212 AD radically changed the concept of romanitas and aided in the further assimilation of native Iberian cultures. Three Roman emperors, Theodosius I, Trajan and Hadrian, came from the Roman provinces of Hispania, as did the authors Quintilian, Martialis, Lucan and Seneca. One of the main consequences of the romanization of Hispania was the development and use of the Spanish language and the Portuguese language after the fall of the Western Roman empire in the fifth century. These worldwide important languages evolved from Vulgar Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 BC.

In the game, the player is tasked to produce one or more specific chemical molecules via an assembly line by programming two remote manipulators (called \\"waldos\\" in the game) that interact with atoms and molecules through a visual programming language. SpaceChem was the developer's first foray into a commercial title after a number of free Flash-based browser games that feature similar puzzle-based assembly problems. The game was initially released for Microsoft Windows at the start of 2011 via Zachtronics' own website. Though it was initially rejected for sale on the Steam platform, Valve later offered to sell the game after it received high praise from game journalists; further attention came from the game's release alongside one of the Humble Indie Bundles. The game has since been ported to other computing platforms and mobile devices. Reviewers found the game's open-ended problem-solving nature as a highlight of the title. SpaceChem was incorporated into some academic institutions for teaching concepts related to both chemistry and programming.  Gameplay  titanium oxide and zinc oxide using titanium, zinc, and oxygen, and deliver the completed molecules to the appropriate quadrant on the right In SpaceChem, the player takes the role of a SpaceChem Reactor Engineer whose task is to create circuits through which atoms and molecules flow with the aid of waldos to produce particular batches of chemical shipments for each level. The primary game mode of SpaceChem depicts the internal workings of a Reactor, mapped out to a 10 √ó 8 regular grid. Each reactor has up to two input and up to two output quadrants, and supports two waldos, red and blue, manipulated through command icons placed on the grid. The player adds commands from an array to direct each waldo independently through the grid. The commands direct the movement of the waldo, to pick up, rotate, and drop atoms and molecules, and to trigger reactor events such as chemical bond formation. The two waldos can also be synchronized, forcing one to wait for the other to reach a synchronization command. The reactors may support specific nodes, set by the player, that act where atomic bonds can be made or broken, where atoms can undergo fission or fusion, or where logic decisions based on atom type can be made. As such, the player is challenged to create a visual program to accept the given inputs, disassemble and reassemble them as necessary, and deliver them to the target output areas to match the required product. The product molecule does not need to match orientation or specific layout of the molecules as long as the molecule is topologically equivalent with respect to atoms, bonds, and bond types; however, in larger puzzles, these factors will influence the inputs to downstream reactors. While the two waldos can cross over each other without harm, collision of atoms with one another or with the walls of the reactor is not allowed; such collisions stop the program and force the player to re-evaluate their solution. Similarly, if a waldo delivers the wrong product, the player will need to check their program. The player successfully completes each puzzle by constructing a program capable of repeatedly generating the required output, meeting a certain quota. In larger puzzles, the player can also guide the formation of chemicals through multiple reactors, which they place out on a larger rectangular grid representing the planet's surface. From here, the output from one reactor will become the input for another reactor; the player is often free to determine what intermediate products to produce to send to the next reactor. The player must not only program the individual reactors, often limited in functionality such as one that can only break bonds but not form them, but plan out the location and order of reactors to make the final product. The game's puzzles are divided into groups set on different planets. Players generally must complete each puzzle in order to progress to the next one, but the game includes optional harder puzzles. Final boss levels, called out as defense levels, complete each planet; here, the player must efficiently create chemicals and deliver them in a timely manner, once the reactor systems have been started, to trigger defense systems to ward off attacking enemies before they destroy a control structure. Upon completion of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a leaderboard based on the number of instructions placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors required to meet the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having cleared a puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number of instructions, cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user- submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included an open-ended sandbox mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.  Development  Barth was inspired by the derelict gasworks at Seattle's Gas Works Park in the creation of SpaceChem Prior to SpaceChem, Zach Barth, the designer behind Zachtronics Industries, had created several Flash- based browser games with automation puzzles, including The Codex of Alchemical Engineering where the player had to place and program manipulator arms to construct atoms and molecules following the rules of alchemy. Barth had wanted to expand the ideas in Codex to include more realistic aspects of chemistry, such as more complex molecules, but did not pursue the idea immediately afterwards. About a year after completing Codex, Barth was inspired by the disused chemical plant at Gas Works Park in Seattle, giving him the idea to incorporate pipelines into the basic mechanics of molecule-building from Codex. SpaceChem took about a year with a team of seven people from around the globe to create: Barth was responsible for design and production, Collin Arnold and Keith Holman handled the programming, Ryan Sumo created the visuals, Evan Le Ny the music, Ken Bowen the sound and Hillary Field created the game's narrative. The development costs were around $4,000, with the team working on the game during their spare time on weekends. Barth considered this a risk-cutting measure; if the game did not succeed, the team still had their full-time jobs they could continue. The team used the C# language built on the Mono framework for the game which would allow for easy porting to other platforms beyond Microsoft Windows. Initially, they had considered using Microsoft XNA for ease of porting to the Xbox 360, but later opted to consider other release platforms, requiring them to switch to the more portable Mono framework. In designing puzzles, Barth wanted to keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player to come to a solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the tutorials provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained baffled as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of the game from these tutorials such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed by the top players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard. He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments and discussions on the previous games. Barth had envisioned the game as his first commercial project, and based on feedback from Codex and other games, wanted to include a storyline along with the puzzles. The story missions included \\"defense\\" puzzles that typically were considered very hard to solve; Barth recognized after release that players would stall out at these puzzles and not attempt to complete the game, with only 2% of the players tracked having reached the final puzzle. Barth would have likely placed the harder puzzles at the end or as part of the ResearchNet add-on. He also tried too much to incorporate a theme based on scientific research, popularized at the time by the success of Portal. He instead found potential players were scared off by the chemistry aspect even though the game had little connection to real chemistry; a colleague had once suggested to Barth that if the game was named SpaceGems and modeled around alchemy, the game would have sold twice as many copies. SpaceChem was released on January 1, 2011 via digital download from the Zachtronics website for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux computers. They had initially sought to get approval from Valve to sell the game through Steam, but Valve refused them, and thus opted for sale from their own website. Shortly after its release, the game received several positive reviews including one from Quintin Smith of the gaming website Rock Paper Shotgun. Zachtronics was contacted two days later by Valve with an interest to add it to Steam. The game was subsequently made available on Steam by March 4, 2011, and later on GamersGate on March 17, 2011. The inclusion of the game on Steam was considered by Barth to be the largest boost to sales of the game, outweighing any other distribution method they had. Post-release support SpaceChem received a free update in late April 2011, which added several new features to the game as well as new puzzles. The patch included support for the ResearchNet puzzle creation and sharing system, and for the Steam-enabled version, support for achievements and leaderboards specific for Steam friends. The update for the Steam version also included a small set of puzzles tied in with Team Fortress 2, which upon completion would reward the player with a decorative item they could use within Team Fortress 2. The game was included in the Humble Frozen Synapse Bundle charitable sale in early October 2011. SpaceChem was ported to the iPad in October 2011, using touch controls instead of mouse and keyboard to manipulate the visual program. An Android port was released in July 2012. Both mobile platforms include most of the full game excluding the defense puzzles. The sandbox mode was added at the request of a player who was trying to explore SpaceChem computational abilities. Alongside the sandbox mode, Zactronics offered a contest for the most interesting sandbox creation. This same user was able to demonstrate a brainfuck interpreter within SpaceChem, claiming that the visual programming language was Turing complete. Barth has mentioned the possibility of a sequel in an interview with IndieGamer. Zachtronics Industries has encouraged the game to be used as a learning tool for programming and chemistry concepts, and offers discounts for schools, though briefly offered the game free-of-charge for educational institutions for a few months after the release of the sandbox mode addition. According to The Independent Games Developers Association, schools in the United Kingdom have started using SpaceChem to teach students fundamental programming concepts. The success of SpaceChem led to several companies contacting Zachtronics to develop educational titles; the company spent about two years working with Amplify to develop three \\"edutainment\\" games for their platform before they returned to work on more direct entertainment titles, but used the opportunity to improve on their in-game teaching mechanics. On September 30, 2012, SpaceChem was the featured game on IndieGameStand, a site which features indie games with a pay-what-you-want model with a portion of the proceeds going to charity. Zachtronics Industries chose the Against Malaria Foundation as the charity to which 10% of the proceeds were donated. On October 25, 2015, Zachtronics announced they have dropped all support for SpaceChem on the iOS and OS X platform. The reason they gave was due to the complexity of the Mono package for future support.  Reception  SpaceChem was generally well received by critics, with an aggregate Metacritic score of 84 out of 100 from its Microsoft Windows release. Quintin Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said \\"I think we might have just received one of the year's best indie games in the first week of 2011\\". Gamasutra's Margaret Robertson praised SpaceChems gameplay, contrasting it with other open-ended activities as it offers the opportunity for the player to be as creative as they want to be within the minimal ruleset required of each puzzle. Robertson also found the game to be thrilling, having each puzzle initially appear \\"so astonishingly dispiriting\\" to what she had previously learned, but through trial and error coming to a solution that works and giving her the feeling of having \\"made a creative statement\\" in her solution. Eurogamer's John Teti praised the means through which the game introduced new mechanics without excessive reliance on tutorials; he commented that \\"the problems become more daunting\\" through the addition of new elements and commands, the game \\"is always more accessible than it looks\\". Edge said \\"The triumph of SpaceChem is that overcoming these situations is more a case of inventing a solution than discovering one.\\" Team Fortress creator Robin Walker recommended \\"SpaceChem\\" on Steam, calling it \\"Pretty much the greatest game ever made\\". Gamasutra named SpaceChem the best indie game of 2011. Though total sales of the game are unknown, at least 230,000 copies were purchases as part of the game's inclusion in the Humble Indie Bundle. Barth stated that with sales of SpaceChem, he was able to quit his job at Microsoft and run his development company full-time. Ryan Sumo, the freelance artist for the game, gained recognition in the industry and went on to help develop the art for Prison Architect.

The Grupos Armados Espa√±oles (GAE), an armed group operating in the Basque Country in the early years of the Spanish democracy, planted a bomb in a local bar which exploded that evening killing four civilians and wounding ten. The bar was targeted as it was thought to be a meeting point for Basque moderate nationalists in the area. No official inquiries have been made so far. Background The actions described in Spain as \\"Late-Francoist Terrorism\\" took place between the later years of Francoist Spain and 1980. These paramilitary actions were carried out by several far-right neofascist groups, such as the Basque-Spanish Battalion (Batall√≥n Vasco Espa√±ol), Spanish National Action (Acci√≥n Nacional Espa√±ola) or the Spanish Armed Groups (Grupos Armados Espa√±oles). Their targets were people with different ideas, but especially leftist militants and Basque nationalists. According to a former military man who was a member of one of these groups, they were \\"supervised by agents of the Spanish secret service, with money and free hands to act as outlaws\\".Diego Carcedo, S√°enz de Santa Mar√≠a. El general que cambi√≥ de bando, As a result of their actions, between 15 and 40 people were killed. Members of these groups were later recruited in order to form the paramilitary organization known as Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n (GAL). Explosion On 20 January 1980, a group of four people coming from a dinner to celebrate their success in organising the Cavalcade of Magi, arrived in Alonsotegi and parked their Chrysler 150 at the bar's entrance. The group was formed by Jesus Mar√≠a L√≥pez, his girlfriend Garbi√±e Gonz√°lez, Garbi√±e's father Jose √Ångel Gonz√°lez (the bar's owner), and a friend called Jos√© Ignacio Atexebarria. The rest of the group was formed by 6 to 8 more people who were lagging behind in their way to the town. 10 minutes after the arrival the bomb exploded in the bar with 15 people inside. It was inside a cardboard box placed at the left side of the entrance, next to the main door, and it contained a device with 6 kg of Goma-2 and electric ammunition which was triggered after being lifted or moved, as the first witnesses declared, by Liborio Arana G√≥mez (57), one of the victims. The strength of the blast made the roof collapse along with the second floor of the house and made big holes in the third. The canisters of the bar exploded a while after the collapse, a balcony fell over the sidewalk, the Chrysler was split in half. The front part was found later in a mound in front of the bar. Arana's body was \\"completely destroyed\\" and his remains were found in the same mound where the half of the car was discovered and in the fa√ßade of a nearby house. Some human remains were also found in the back garden of the bar. The other three victims were the married couple Pac√≠fico Fika Zuloaga (39) and Mar√≠a Paz Armi√±o (38), from G√ºe√±es, and Manuel Santacoloma Velasco (57), from Alonsotegi. In the first moments of the aftermath, the neighbours awoken by the sound of the explosion, among whom was I√±igo Urkullu, a 19 year-old who later served as Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) president and head of the autonomous Basque Government, were the first to help the victims. Perpetrators The following day the GAE claimed responsibility for the bombing in a phone call made to Diario Vasco and announced that later in the day they would publish a press release, explaining the aims and motivations of the action. In this communiqu√© they pointed out that for each policeman dead there would be four Basque nationalist deaths as they \\"had promised\\". In this document the group assured that they were \\"fighting for the unity of Spain\\" and \\"combating any focus of violence in the Basque country\\". The communiqu√© ended threatening with attacking a \\"problem village of Gipuzkoa\\". Reactions The next day Basque parties condemned the attack describing it as a \\"brutal, wild and indiscriminate action carried out by fascists\\". PNV, Communist Party of Spain (PCE), Euskadiko Ezkerra and Herri Batasuna released a press declaration in Alonsotegi declaring the \\"hate of the Basque people against these kind of actions and against those who organize them\\". A special session was held in Barakaldo Council to condemn the attack and the PNV mayor, described it as a \\"mass assassination\\". Some parties, such as the PCE and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) went on strike two days later, but the PNV rejected this measure and asked the people of Alonsotegi to donate the total amount of one day of work to help the victims. Neighbours from Alonsotegi said to the press that the attackers \\"knew perfectly well what they were doing\\" as the Aldana Bar was a \\"well-known meeting point of Basque nationalists in the area\\", even a Basque popular gastronomic society, named txoko in Basque, formed by members of Herri Batasuna used to meet in the bar's basement.

Speculation as to her true identity has been rife, and several theories, based on information Ferrante has given in interviews as well as analysis drawn from the content of her novels, have been put forth. In 2003, Ferrante published La Frantumaglia, a volume of letters, essays, reflections and interviews, translated into English in 2016, which sheds some light on her background. In a 2013 article for The New Yorker, critic James Wood summarized what is generally accepted about Ferrante, based in part on letters collected in that volume: In March 2016, Marco Santagata, an Italian novelist and philologist, a scholar of Petrarch and Dante, and a professor at the University of Pisa,http://unimap.unipi.it/cercapersone/dettaglio.php?ri=5768&template;=dettaglio.tpl published a paper detailing his theory of Ferrante's identity. Santagata's paper drew on philological analysis of Ferrante's writing, close study of the details about the cityscape of Pisa described in the novel, and the fact that the author reveals an expert knowledge of modern Italian politics. Based on this information, he concluded that the author had lived in Pisa but left by 1966, and therefore identified the probable author as Neapolitan professor Marcella Marmo, who studied in Pisa from 1964 to 1966. Both Marmo and the publisher deny Santagata's identification. In October 2016, investigative reporter Claudio Gatti published an article jointly in Il Sole 24 Ore and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, that relied on financial records related to real estate transactions and royalties payments to draw the conclusion that , a Rome-based translator, is the real author behind the Ferrante pseudonym. Gatti's article was criticized by many in the literary world as a violation of privacy, though Gatti contends that \\"by announcing that she would lie on occasion, Ferrante has in a way relinquished her right to disappear behind her books and let them live and grow while their author remained unknown. Indeed, she and her publisher seemed to have fed public interest in her true identity.\\" British novelist Matt Haig tweeted, \\"Think the pursuit to discover the 'real' Elena Ferrante is a disgrace and also pointless. A writer's truest self is the books they write.\\" The writer Jeanette Winterson, in a Guardian article, denounced Gatti's investigations as malicious and sexist, saying \\"At the bottom of this so-called investigation into Ferrante's identity is an obsessional outrage at the success of a writer ‚Äì female ‚Äì who decided to write, publish and promote her books on her own terms.\\" She went on to say that the desire to uncover Ferrante's identity constitutes an act of sexism in itself, and that \\"Italy is still a Catholic country with strong patriarchial attitudes towards women.\\" Others responding to Gatti's article suggested that knowledge of Ferrante's biography is indeed relevant. In December 2016, the controversial Italian prankster Tommaso Debenedetti published on the website of the Spanish daily El Mundo a purported interview with Raja confirming she was Elena Ferrante; this was quickly denied by Ferrante's publisher, who called the interview a fake. In September 2017, a team of scholars, computer scientists, philologists and linguists at the University of Padua analyzed 150 novels written in Italian by 40 different authors, including seven books by Elena Ferrante, but none by Raja. Based on analysis using several authorship attribution models, they concluded that Anita Raja's husband, author and journalist Domenico Starnone, is the probable author of the Ferrante novels. Raja has worked for E/O Publishing as copy editor and has been editing Starnone's books for years. Ferrante has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that she is actually a man, telling Vanity Fair in 2015 that questions about her gender are rooted in a presumed \\"weakness\\" of female writers. Adaptations Two of Ferrante's novels have been turned into films. Troubling Love (L'amore molesto) became the feature film Nasty Love directed by Mario Martone, while The Days of Abandonment (I giorni dell'abbandono) became a film of the same title directed by Roberto Faenza. In her nonfiction book Fragments (La frantumaglia 2003), Ferrante speaks of her experiences as a writer. In 2016, it was reported that a 32-part television series, The Neapolitan Novels, was in the works, co-produced by the Italian producer Wildside for Fandango Productions, with screenwriting led by the writer Francesco Piccolo. In September 2018, the first two episodes of the renamed My Brilliant Friend, an Italian-language miniseries co-produced by American premium cable network HBO and Italian networks RAI and TIMvision, were aired at the Venice Film Festival. HBO started airing the complete eight episode miniseries, focusing on the first book in The Neapolitan Novels, in November 2018. The second series of eight episodes was aired in 2020. On May 12, 2020, Netflix announced a new drama series based on The Lying Life of Adults.https://deadline.com/2020/05/netflix-series-elena-ferrante-the-lying- life-of-adults-1202932184/ Works * L'amore molesto (1992; English translation: Troubling Love, 2006); filmed as Nasty Love (1995) * I giorni dell'abbandono (2002; English translation: The Days of Abandonment, 2005) * La frantumaglia (2003; English translation Frantumaglia, 2016) * La figlia oscura (2006; English translation: The Lost Daughter, 2008) * La spiaggia di notte (2007; English translation: The Beach at Night, 2016) * L'amica geniale (2011; English translation: My Brilliant Friend, 2012). . * Storia del nuovo cognome, L'amica geniale volume 2 (2012; English translation: The Story of a New Name, 2013). . * Storia di chi fugge e di chi resta, L'amica geniale volume 3 (2013; English translation: Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, 2014). . * Storia della bambina perduta, L'amica geniale volume 4 (2014; English translation: The Story of the Lost Child, 2015). . *L‚Äôinvenzione occasionale (2019; English translation: Incidental Inventions, 2019).

When both the supply and return ducts are constructed in this manner, it is possible to insulate the ducts and the dropped ceiling so that the upper airspace is not heated or cooled, increasing energy efficiency. A commercial building with a plenum airspace. A plenum created by accident can go unnoticed and become a fire hazard, due to cabling installed under the assumption that this will always be a non-plenum airspace. A plenum space is a part of a building that can facilitate air circulation for heating and air conditioning systems, by providing pathways for either heated/conditioned or return airflows, usually at greater than atmospheric pressure. Space between the structural ceiling and the dropped ceiling or under a raised floor is typically considered plenum; however, some drop-ceiling designs create a tight seal that does not allow for airflow and therefore may not be considered a plenum air-handling space.Thomas, Timothy. \\"What is plenum? - Definition from WhatIs.com, TechTarget, September 21, 2005. Retrieved July 25, 2017.  Purpose  The cavity/plenum space is typically used to house the communication cables for the building's computer and telephone network; however, it has been proposed that the growing abandonment of cable in plenum spaces may pose a serious hazard in the event of a fire, as once the fire reaches the plenum space the airflow present in the space supplies fresh oxygen to the flame and makes it grow much stronger than it would have otherwise. Recent testing by ASHRAE has shown that, while flame spread is limited by accumulated cable bundles, other structural concerns may still exist due to increased load on suspended components. As plenum spaces are restricted from use as areas for storage, the principle behind removal of abandoned cable is that regulated removal prevents the use of plenum spaces as a storage area for abandoned cable. In addition, no high-voltage powered equipment is allowed in the plenum space because presence of fresh air can greatly increase danger of rapid flame spreading should the equipment catch on fire. Diligence is required to make sure that a non-plenum airspace stays that way. A non-plenum airspace can become a plenum airspace by accident if the ductwork is disconnected and not properly repaired and resealed. Ductwork disconnection can occur due to building damage such as earthquakes, aging, or adverse environment causing the metal to corrode and fall apart, or simply negligence on the part of building contractors that leave work unfinished. In all such cases, discovery, and repair of such problems to eliminate unintended plenums is difficult due to the hidden nature, limited space, and difficult access of most installed drop ceilings. For highest fire safety, it is best to assume all drop-ceiling airspaces are plenums, whether or not they are officially designated as one.

Boom! tells the story of two best friends, Charlie and Jimbo (a nickname for James). When Jimbo's sister, Becky, says that the teachers are going to send him to a school for mentally ill children, Jimbo and Charlie sneaked into the staff room, where they hid a walkie-talkie to eavesdrop on the teachers' conversation, in order to confirm what Becky said was true. None of the information they hear means anything (which points to the fact that Becky was just trying to scare Jimbo), except for the surprising fact that their teachers both Mr. Kidd and Mrs. Pearce is speaking another language. After a while of dangerous investigating (for instance, sneaking into Mrs. Pearce's attic) they were approached by a man in a suit at a restaurant who told them to leave their teachers alone and then promptly burned a hole through the table they were sitting at with his finger. They disobeyed his order, however, and Charlie was kidnapped and taken to the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, where he had to fake happiness or else face certain death. But, Jimbo did not seem to know this. After a while of Jimbo investigating Charlie's \\"Spudvetch!\\" notebook (their secret notebook for gathering information) he discovered that his best bet to find him would be on the Isle Of Skye, in Scotland. He and his sister, who he had managed to convince to come with him, eventually arrived there, although with much difficulty, and inside an abandoned shack, a mysterious portal opened. Jimbo got sucked into Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, but his sister stayed on Earth, unaware. He found Charlie but the same guy from the restaurant discovers them and Charlie's fake happiness and imprisons them. After a couple days, the man releases them only to enslave them into bringing back escaped teachers or face death. They make it out only to discover that Becky has been holding the teachers hostage. The man confronts Charlie and Jimbo, but Becky neutralizes him and all three of them manage to defeat and destroy the man. After a while Mr. Kidd and Mrs. Pearce were fired from the school as a result of the kidnapping. They went for revenge on Charlie and tried to kill him. Luckily, the FBI already knew what was going on and had been watching them. They shot Mr. Kidd and Mrs. Pearce and then said that if they ever told anyone about Mr. Kidd and Mrs. Pearce, they would be hunted down and killed. They decided they did not want to be killed, so returned to their normal lives. Publishing history right Gridzbi Spudvetch! was published in 1992 by Walker Books. As mentioned in Boom!, Gridzbi Spudvetch had many faults. Mark Haddon admitted that 'no one could pronounce the title and know what the story was about until they read it', and also mentioned that the book was 'full of references to floppy disks, cassette players and Walkmans'. The book went rapidly out of print. The book would have stayed out of print, but over the years several people commented about how much they loved the book. Alison Williams, the teacher of Lilac 4 from SS Philip and James Primary School in Oxford, said she had been reading the book to her children and how much they loved it. To prove this she sent letters from the children to Mark Haddon, which were all kind and funny and very complimentary. With some inspiration Mark Haddon made a new edition, which was published in 2009 under the title Boom!. The book is dedicated to them.

They lie within the comuni of Comacchio and Argenta in the province of Ferrara and the comune of Ravenna in the province of Ravenna. The area, covering almost 17,000 hectares within the Parco regionale del Delta del Po, the regional park of the Po Delta, is classified as a Site of Community Importance and a Special Protection Area. It is also rated internationally important by the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.  Description  The Valli di Comacchio are a lagoon and wetland complex comprising four principal basins, The Valle Lido di Magnavacca, the Valle Fossa di Porto, the Valle Campo and the Valle Fattibello, and several smaller ones. Approximately ten kilometres to the north, also in the territory of Comacchio, is the Valle di Bertuzzi. The lagoon was formed around the tenth century due to subsidence of the soil and silting of the coastal zone. At the time of formation, the area was flooded with fresh water from the recurrent flooding of the rivers. From the sixteenth century on, they gradually were filled with sea water resulting in the modern appearance of brackish water- filled basins. The original extent of the Valli di Comacchio ‚Äì covering about 73,000 hectares ‚Äì was progressively reduced as a result of various land reclamation projects. The current coverage of the wetlands is around 13,000 hectares, from the Comune of Comacchio to the river Reno. The Valli di Comacchio remain some of the largest wetlands in Italy.Lauchlan H. Fraser, Paul A. Keddy, The World's Largest Wetlands: ecology and conservation, 2005.  Flora  Some of the most common plants in the area are oaks, pine, beech in higher ground, and reeds, and tamarisk. Additionally, many types of flowers can be found, including several species of Limonium. In this region there are many pine forests, most notably those of Cervia and Ravenna as well as the Mesola Forest.  Fauna  The Valli di Comacchio are home to the greatest variety of birds of Italy. There are over 300 species of birds such as flamingos, black-winged stilts, egrets and other herons and kingfishers. In addition, there are fish such as bream, eels, sea bass, mullet, and sole. Foxes are common.  Points of interest  Fishing is a common occupation: in fact there are still many fishing settlements in the area today. Typical of the area are fishing lodges mounted on poles in the water. These structures serve both as fishing stations and places to monitor for illegal fishing. Also common are eel-fishing basins called lavorieri. There are numerous salt- panning facilities in the area.

Four of these use Flash to make them cross-platform, in spite of Flash's \\"terrible\\" development environment. The other one is based on .NET for greater programming convenience. SpaceChem also used .NET, as Barth considers C# to be \\"the best language ever invented\\". For marketing reasons, Barth decided against XNA with its capability to cross- publish to Xbox 360, and switched to OpenGL, which allowed him to target the three operating systems required for inclusion in the Humble Indie Bundle. After completing The Codex of Alchemical Engineering and getting positive feedback from it, Barth came up with the idea of making commercial games. The first of these was SpaceChem, which he developed the Zachtronics label for. It was also the first game where he took in a number of collaborators to help. SpaceChem was critically praised, which led Barth to continue to develop more games under the Zachtronics label. A few ideas failed to come to light, and with expectations for the studio to make another game, he opted to make Ironclad Tactics, which was more a real-time based card game rather than a puzzle game. Ironclad Tactics did not do as well as SpaceChem, and Barth realized there was more a market for the puzzle games that he had previously developed, and turned back to his Flash-based games. Initially he looked to take The Codex of Alchemical Engineering to make it a full commercial release, but instead ended up producing Infinifactory and later TIS-100. In 2015, Barth joined Valve to work on SteamVR. He worked there for 10 months before departing. Near the time he started to work at Valve, Barth had been considering shutting down Zachtronics due to stress of running the business alongside the new responsibilities at Valve. Sometime between the release of TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O, Barth had come into contact with Alliance Media Holdings who offered to buy the studio and to manage the publishing of the games, while allowing Barth retain his creative lead and control. Since the studio's acquisition, it has published Shenzhen I/O, Opus Magnum, a spiritual successor to The Codex, and Exapunks. In June 2019, the studio has published the book Zach-Like that includes design documents and other reference material used by Barth and his team during the development of his games. Zachtronics used Kickstarter to produce physical copies of the book by early 2019, and by June 2019 released title as a free eBook on Steam along with a bundle of Barth's older titles. Zachtronics launched Zachademics in June 2019, a program to allow educational and non-profit institutions to freely download and use Infinifactory, TIS-100, Shenzen I/O, Opus Magnum and Exapunks for educational purposes. Zachtronics has previously offered SpaceChem in a similar manner.  Games developed  Zachtronics' games have generally been focused around engineering puzzle games, designing machines or the equivalent to take input and make output; these are generally part of the broader class of programming games. These games, including SpaceChem, Infinifactory, and Opus Magnum, feature multiple puzzles that are open ended in solution; as long as the player can make the required output, the game considers that puzzle solved and allows the player to access the next puzzle. Atop their solution, the player is shown statistics related to their solution which relate to some efficiency - how fast their solution completed the puzzle, how few parts they used, and the like. These stats are given with histograms from other players, including their friends via the game's storefront, that have also completed that puzzle. This gives a type of competitiveness to the game for players to find ways to optimize their solutions and improve their relative scores. Newer games also feature support for user-created puzzles.  Infiniminer  Infiniminer is an open source multi-player block-based sandbox building and digging game, in which the player plays as a miner searching for minerals by carving tunnels through procedurally generated maps and building structures. According to the author Barth, it was based on the earlier games Infinifrag, Team Fortress, and Motherload by XGen Studios.. Barth wrote Infiniminer in his spare time, with the help of a friend, and released it in steps of incremental updates during April‚ÄìMay 2009. It quickly garnered a following on message boards around the Internet. Infiniminer was originally intended to be played as a team-based competitive game, where the goal is to locate and excavate precious metals, and bring the findings to the surface to earn points for the player's team. However, as the game gained popularity, players gravitated towards the emergent gameplay functionality of building in-world objects, instead of the stated design goal of competition. Zachtronics discontinued development of the game less than a month after its first release as the result of its source code leak. As Barth had not obfuscated the C# .NET source code of the game, it was decompiled and extracted from the binaries. Hackers modified the code to make mods, but also started making clients that would target vulnerabilities in the game as well as build incompatible game forks that fragmented its user base. Barth, who was making the game for free, then lost interest and dropped the project, as development of the game had become too difficult. The source code of Infiniminer is now available under the MIT License. Building Infiniminer requires Visual Studio 2008 and XNA Game Studio 3.0.https://github.com/krispykrem/Infiniminer/tree/master Infiniminer is the game that initially inspired Minecraft (and subsequently FortressCraft, CraftWorld and Ace of Spades). The visuals and mechanics of procedural generation and terrain deformation of Minecraft were drawn from Infiniminer. According to Minecraft developer Markus Persson, after he discovered Infiniminer, he \\"decided it was the game he wanted to do\\".  SpaceChem  Zachtronics is also known for its puzzle game SpaceChem in which the player creates chemical pathways similar in style to visual programming. SpaceChem has garnered praise with the gaming community and is currently one of three games on the recommendation page of Team Fortress creator Robin Walker (the others being Hotline Miami and FTL: Faster Than Light), with him declaring it as \\"Pretty much the greatest game ever made\\". In March 2011, Barth stated the possibility of making expansion packs to SpaceChem and adding a free update and editor which would allow users to create their own levels which could then be shared to other users, with the best ones being picked out by Zachtronics to be published and these were released on April 29 as the Shareholders' Update. Barth hinted at the prospect of a sequel and also stated that it would be fantastic to have SpaceChem on a future Humble Bundle. The game was included in the Humble Frozen Synapse Bundle charitable sale in early October 2011. The following year SpaceChem was the featured game on IndieGameStand, a site which features indie games with a pay-what-you-want model with a portion of the proceeds going to charity. Barth chose the Against Malaria Foundation as the charity to which 10% of the proceeds were donated.

The elements of a lottery correspond to the probabilities that each of the states of nature will occur.Mas-Colell, Andreu, Michael Whinston and Jerry Green (1995). Microeconomic theory. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Much of the theoretical analysis of choice under uncertainty involves characterizing the available choices in terms of lotteries. In economics, individuals are assumed to rank lotteries according to a rational system of preferences, although it is now accepted that people make irrational choices systematically. Behavioral economics studies what happens in markets in which some of the agents display human complications and limitations.Mullainathan, Sendhil., & Thaler, Richard. (2000). 'Behavioral Economics'. NBER Working Paper No. 7948, p. 2.  Choice under risk  According to expected utility theory, people choose among risky alternatives or scenarios using a criterion that combines three features: the subjective estimate of the probabilities of the possible outcomes, the gambling preferences, and the ranking of prizes and penalties. The combination of the last two features is made through a utility attached to them by a utility function. Then this abstract measure is combined with the subjective probabilities through a linear combination of the utilities. The weights in this linear combination are the subjective probabilities. For example, let there be three states of nature, \\"beautiful and eventful trip by car\\", \\"staying home\\", and \\"death by car accident\\". Their consequences and utility values for a particular individual are: * Beautiful and eventful trip by car: 16 utils * Staying home: 9 utils * Death by car accident: 4 utils If the person had to choose the best of two scenarios A and B, each of which assigns probabilities to the states of nature, how would they do it? A theory of choice under risk starts by letting people have preferences on the set of lotteries over these kind of states of nature. If preferences over lotteries are complete and transitive, they are called rational. As a result of computing the expected utility from scenarios A and B, rational people would pick the one with the highest expected utility. Rankings of alternatives made under uncertainty can be represented by cardinal utility, but they are not ordinal. The assumption about combining linearly the individual utilities and making the resulting number be the criterion to be maximized can be justified of the grounds of the independence axiom. Therefore, the validity of expected utility theory depends on the empirical validity of the independence axiom. The preference relation \\\\succsim! satisfies independence if for any three simple lotteries p, q, r, and any number \\\\alpha E(0,1) it holds that p \\\\succsim! q if and only if \\\\alpha p + (1-\\\\alpha)r \\\\succsim! \\\\alpha q + (1-\\\\alpha)r. Indifference maps can be represented in the simplex.

Stampe et Vertongen aircraft designed by Alfred Renard gained the prefix \\"R\\" was a training biplane produced in Belgium in the 1920s. It was a conventional, single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span that were braced with N-struts near their tips. The fixed undercarriage consisted of two mainwheels that were joined by a common through axle, plus a tailskid. The student pilot and the instructor sat in open cockpits in tandem that were fitted with dual controls. Construction was of mixed materials, with metal used for the undercarriage, engine mount, and cabane struts. The control surfaces were operated by a rigid linkage made of dural tube. The horizontal stabilizer was adjustable in flight, using a lever in the cockpit to adjust the aircraft's trim. Incorrect use of this latter feature led to a number of accidents. The base model RSV 22/180 was powered by a 134-kW (180-hp) Hispano- Suiza engine, but the aircraft was designed to use powerplants of up to 220 kW (300 hp). The RSV 22/200 variant used a 150-kW (200-hp) Renard-built radial engine in place of the Hispano-Suiza. The Belgian Air Force purchased 20 examples of the RSV 22/180. In 1928, Lt Edmond Thieffry and SLt Philippe Quersin piloted a civil-registered RSV 22/180 (registration O-BAJE) on an attempt at a long-distance flight to Africa. They departed Deurne on 26 June, attempting to reach Kinshasa. Bad weather forced them to land at Mourmelon, France, only away.

The only species is Pararhadinaea melanogaster, sometimes known as the Madagascar burrowing snake. It is endemic to the island of Madagascar. Description It is a small snake with a maximum recorded size of less than 30 centimeters. The color pattern consists of a pale golden-brown ground color with a series of dark-brown and cream parallel longitudinal stripes. The ventral scales are very dark, almost black. The smooth scales show a strong green-blue iridescence. One subspecies (P. melanogaster marojejyensis) is currently recognized. Geographic range Endemic to Madagascar. Occurs in the northern parts of the island. The type locality is Nosy Be. The single known specimen of the subspecies, P. melanogaster marojejyensis, was collected from the Marojejy National Park.Glaw, F. and M. Vences (2007): A Field Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of Madagascar, 3rd Edition. K√∂ln, Vences and Glaw Verlag. Habitat The species has only been found within forested habitats including both Madagascar dry deciduous forests and Madagascar lowland forests at a few localities including Nosy Be, Ankarana Special Reserve, and Daraina Conservation Site and some unprotected forest fragments near the village of Tsarakibany. Conservation status Pararhadinaea melanogaster is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because \\"its extent of occurrence is less than 6,500 km¬≤, it is presently known from only seven locations, and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its forest habitat resulting from agricultural conversion\\". It is considered a rare species as, since its discovery, only nine specimens have been officially recorded. Behaviour Almost nothing is known of the behaviour of this species. It is very secretive and seems to spend most of the day hiding amongst leaf litter, under logs and possibly even below the ground. Feeding The diet is likely to consist of small invertebrates. Reproduction Nothing is known of the breeding behaviour of this species. It is presumed to lay eggs.

The hospital is located in Arles in southern France. One of the paintings is of the central garden between four buildings titled Garden of the Hospital in Arles (also known as the Courtyard of the Hospital at Arles); the other painting is of a ward within the hospital titled Ward of the Hospital in Arles. Van Gogh also painted a Portrait of Dr. F√©lix Rey his physician while in the hospital. Arles Arles is located in a region called Provence-Alpes- C√¥te d'Azur, department of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne in southern France. It is about southeast of N√Æmes. History Arles became a successful port for trade in France during the Roman period. Many immigrants from North Africa came to Arles in the 17th and 18th centuries; their influence is reflected in many of the houses of the town that were built during that period. Arles remained economically important for many years as a major port on the Rh√¥ne. The arrival of the railway in the 19th century eventually took away of much of the river trade, reducing the city's commercial business. Because Arles maintained Proven√ßal charm it attracted artists, like Van Gogh. Van Gogh The Yellow House (1888) Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F464) Van Gogh came to Arles on February 20, 1888 and initially stayed at the lodgings at Restaurant Carrel. Signs of spring were evident in the budding almond trees and of winter by the snow-covered landscape. To Van Gogh the scene seemed like a Japanese landscape.Van Gogh; Leeuw, 353 Arles was quite a different place than anywhere else he had lived. The climate was sunny, hot and dry and the local inhabitants had more of an appearance and sound of people from Spain. The \\"vivid colors and strong compositional outlines\\" of Provence led van Gogh to call the area \\"the Japan of the South.\\" In this time he produced more than 200 paintings including The Starry Night [Starry Night over the Rhone], Caf√© de Nuit and The Sunflowers. Van Gogh had few friends in Arles, although through acquaintance with Joseph Roulin, a postman, and Ginoux, the owner of Cafe de la Gare where he next roomed, he made many portraits of the Roulin family and of Madame Ginoux. Part of his difficulty in making friends was his inability to master the Proven√ßal dialect, \\"whole days go by without my speaking a single word to anyone, except to order my meals or coffee.\\" In the beginning of his time in Arles, though, he was so enthused by the setting in Provence that the lack of connection with others hadn't troubled him. In October 1888 Paul Gauguin came to Arles and joined van Gogh in his rented rooms at The Yellow House.Van Gogh; Leeuw, 385 Unfortunately many of the places that van Gogh had visited and painted were destroyed during bombing raids in World War II. Events leading up to stay at Arles hospital Portrait of Doctor F√©lix Rey (F500, JH1659), oil on canvas 1889, Pushkin Museum. Rey disliked his portrait and gave it away. Van Gogh's mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in an altercation with Paul Gauguin in December 1888 following which van Gogh cut off part of his own left ear.Maurer, 192 He was then hospitalized in Arles twice over a few months. His condition was diagnosed by the hospital as \\"acute mania with generalised delirium\\". Dr. F√©lix Rey, a young intern at the hospital, also suggested there might be \\"a kind of epilepsy\\" involved that he characterised as mental epilepsy.Naifeh and Smith (2011), 701 ff., 729, 749 Although some, such as Johanna van Gogh, Paul Signac and posthumous speculation by doctors Doiteau & Leroy have said that van Gogh just removed part of his earlobe and maybe a little more,Erickson, 106 art historian Rita Wildegans maintains that without exception, all of the witnesses from Arles said that he removed the entire left ear. In January 1889, he returned to the Yellow House where he was living, but spent the following month between hospital and home suffering from hallucinations and delusions that he was being poisoned. In March 1889, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople, who called him \\"fou roux\\" (the redheaded madman). Signac visited him in hospital and van Gogh was allowed home in his company. In April 1889, he moved into rooms owned by Dr. F√©lix Rey, after floods damaged paintings in his own home.Pickvance (1986). Chronology, 239‚Äì242Tralbaut (1981), 265‚Äì273 Around this time, he wrote, \\"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\\" Finally in May 1889 he left Arles for the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence,Hughes, 145 having understood his own mental fragility and with a desire to leave Arles.Maurer, 86 Arles Hospital The courtyard of the former Arles hospital, now named \\"Espace Van Gogh,\\" is a center for van Gogh's works, several of which are masterpieces.Fisher, 563 The garden, framed on all four sides by buildings of the complex, is approached through arcades on the first floor. A circulation gallery is located on the first and second floors. The Old Hospital of Arles, also known as H√¥tel-Dieu-Saint-Espirit, was built in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its main entrance was on Rue Dulau in Arles. In the early 16th century there were thirty-two charitable institutions serving the city. The archbishop of Arles decided to consolidate the institutions into one organization at the center of Arles. Construction was conducted over two centuries. During excavations remains were unearthed from a protohistory period [a period between prehistory and written history ] revealing an unknown part of the ancient urban framework, as well as a necropolis from the Roman esplanade. In 1835 three wings were built to accommodate a severe cholera epidemic. In the beginning of the 20th century the hospital was modified to bring it up to medical standards of the day. In 1974 the Joseph-Imbert Hospital was opened and many functions of the Old Hospital of Arles transferred to the new hospital. By 1986 all medical departments had vacated the buildings and the hospital became part of a restoration project to create a cultural and university center. The center includes \\"a media library, the public records, the International College of the Literary Translation (C.I.T.L.), the university radio, a vast showroom, as well as a few shops.\\" Architects Denis Froidevaux and Jean-Louis T√©trel, chosen for the project, preserved historic features, such as the Roman esplanade. Funding by benefactors meant the hospital serviced all patient's needs, including abandoned children and orphans. Starting in 1664 nuns of the Order of Saint Augustin cared for the patients. Paintings The Ward of Arles Hospital portrays the institution and the Garden of the Hospital in Arles the scene outside his hospital room window or off of a balcony.Fell, 28 Van Gogh was also occasionally able to leave the hospital complex and paint the fields. Garden of the Hospital in Arles Van Gogh made a drawing of the courtyard of the hospital in June 1889. The vantage point for the painting was his room within the hospital. Van Gogh's description and his painting of the garden allow for identification of its flowers, such as: blue bearded irises, forget-me-nots, oleander, pansies, primroses, and poppies. The original design of the courtyard as described by Van Gogh has been preserved. Radiating segments are surrounded by a \\"plante bande\\" now filled with irises. A difference between the painting and the garden is that van Gogh increased the size of the central fish garden for better composition.Fell, 30 Adept at using color to convey mood, the shades of blue and gold in the painting seem to suggest melancholy. The yellow, orange, red and green in the painting are not vivid shades seen in other work from Arles, such as Bedroom in Arles.Acton, 109-110 Ward in the Hospital in Arles In October 1889 van Gogh resumed painting of a fever ward titled Ward in the Hospital in Arles. The large study had been unattended for a while and van Gogh's interest was sparked when he read an article regarding Fyodor Dostoyevsky's book 'Souvenirs de la maison des morts (\\"Memories of the House of the Dead\\"). Vincent described the painting to his sister Wil, \\"In the foreground a big black stove around which some grey and black forms of patients and then behind the very long ward paved in red with the two rows of white beds, the partitions white, but a lilac- or green-white, and the windows with pink curtains, with green curtains, and in the background two figures of nuns in black and white. The ceiling is violet with large beams.\\" Debra Mancoff, author of Van Gogh's Flowers,Mancoff comments, \\"In his painting, Ward of Arles Hospital, the exaggerated length of the corridor and the nervous contours that delineate the figures of the patients express the emotional weight of his isolation and confinement.\\" Portrait of Dr. F√©lix Rey Van Gogh made a portrait of the physician who had treated his ear, Dr. F√©lix Rey, whom he had described in letters to his brother, Theo, as ‚Äúbrave, hardworking, and always helping people.‚Äù By January 17, 1889 Van Gogh had given the portrait to Rey as a keepsake.Van Gogh; Suh, 242 Rey's mother reportedly deemed the portrait ‚Äúhideous‚Äù and used to close a hole in the family's chicken coop. In 1901, an art dealer, possibly Lucien Molinard‚Äì who had received six Van Goghs to sell from Rey in 1900 ‚Äìacquired three paintings from Dr. Rey, including the portrait which was in the possession of Ambroise Vollard by 1903. In 2016, the portrait was installed at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, with an estimated value of over $50 million. Drawings Theo wrote of a drawing he received, \\"The hospital at Arles is outstanding, the butterfly and branches of eglantine are very beautiful too: simple in colour and very beautifully drawn.\\"Van Gogh; Leeuw, 447 File:Van Gogh - Garten des Hospitals in Arles.jpegGarden of Hospital in Arles April 1889 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F1467) Oskar Reinhart collection Both the hospital garden and ward paintings were held by Oskar Reinhart from a powerful family in the banking and insurance industries.

The first prominent structures on the street were the First Parish Meeting House, built in 1740 and replaced to the present structure in the 1820s as well as the hay scales in Market Square, later known as Monument Square. From the early settlement of Portland until the American Revolutionary War period, Back Street was considered the far edge of the town. It took the name of Congress Street beginning in 1823.

Early settlements or factories included Masulipatnam (1611) and Madras (1640) in the south, Surat (1612) in the west, and modern-day Kolkata (1698‚Äì99) in the east.Gupta, P. L. (1996). Coins, New Delhi: National Book Trust, , pp.199‚Äì219. These colonies gave rise to Madras Presidency, Bombay Presidency, and Bengal Presidency, and each Presidency had a separate coinage and monetary system. In 1835, the EIC adopted a unified system of coinage throughout all British possessions in India and the older Presidency system was discontinued. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, control of EIC territories passed to the British Crown.Fred Pridmore (1980). The Coins of the British Commonwealth of Nations (to the end of the reign of George VI, 1952). Part 4: India, Volume 2: Uniform coinage East India Company, 1835‚Äì58, Imperial period, 1858‚Äì1947. Spink and Son Ltd, London. Coinage issued after 1857 were under the authority of the monarch as India became part of the British Empire. With the Royal Titles Act 1876, Victoria took the title \\"Empress of India\\", so in 1877 coin inscriptions changed from to . There was a transition period after India gained independence on 15 August 1947, and the first set of republic India coins were issued in 1950. Coinage under the British can be divided into two periods: East India Company (EIC) issues, pre-1835; and Imperial issues struck under direct authority of the crown. The EIC issues can be further subdivided into two subcategories: the Presidency issues, which comprise separate Madras Presidency, Bombay Presidency, and Bengal Presidency issues; and uniform coinage for all British territories from 1835 to 1858. Imperial issues bear obverse portraits of Queen Victoria (dated 1862‚Äì1901), Edward VII (dated 1903‚Äì1910), George V (dated 1911‚Äì1936), and George VI (dated 1938‚Äì1947). No British India coins were issued during the brief reign of Edward VIII. East India Company 1835 East India Company quarter anna, part of the unified coinage introduced that year. The English East India Company was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth I which allowed trade monopoly with eastern countries including Sumatra, Java, and India. The territories governed by the East India Company were divided into three major administrative regions: Madras Presidency in the south, Bombay Presidency in the west, and Bengal Presidency in the east. Most of the north, however, for a long time continued to remain under the control of the Mughal emperor, and later, local rulers including the Marathas and Rajputs. Each of the three presidencies under East India Company governance issued their own coins until a unified coinage throughout all territories was introduced in 1835.G. Findlay Shirras (1920). Indian Finance and Banking. MacMillan and Company, London. https://books.google.com/books?id=UvQiAQAAMAAJ Early presidency issues often imitated local issues and the Mughal design in order to gain wider acceptance by the native population. Early European style coins were not popular outside jurisdiction of their respective settlements. In spite of having their own mints, the EIC either sent its bullion to the Mughal mints or forged the common coins of the contemporary Mughal Emperor. In 1717, the EIC obtained rights to strike coins in the name of the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar on the island of Bombay. Madras Presidency The major mints in the west responsible for issuing coins for the East India Company included Surat, Bombay (Mumbai or Munbai), and Ahmadabad. From 1621 till 1800, the English sent their precious metal bullion to the Surat mint, controlled by the Nawab, to be coined into local gold mohurs and silver rupees. As the Surat mint was unable to meet the required production rate, silver was also sent to the Ahmadabad mint in 1636. During later years, the Ahmadabad mint also struck rupees for the Bombay Presidency in the name of Muhammad Akbar II with the dates 1233‚Äì1241 AH (1817‚Äì1825 CE). In December 1672, the East India Company started a mint in Bombay and European style gold, silver, copper, and tin coins were struck. The gold coin was named Carolina, the silver coin Anglina, the copper Copperoon, and the tin coin called the Tinny. The exchange rate was set at 11 Tiduckone Copperoon and 48 Copperoons to one Anglina. No gold coins (Carolinas) were struck until 1717. The obverse of the silver and copper coins showed inside an inner circle the arms of the Company, and within an outer circle the legend HON:SOC:ANG:IND:ORI, for Honorabilis Societas Anglicana Indiarum Orientalium, or 'Honourable English East India Company'. The reverse of these coins had the inscription MON BOMBAY ANGLIC REGIMS A¬∞ 7¬∞ in the centre and another legend A DEO PAX & INCREMENTVM around it.Colin R. Bruce II, et al. (editors) (1981) The Standard Guide to South Asian Coins and Paper Money Since 1556 AD (Iola: Krause Publications, ), pp. 272‚Äì306 After issuing coins for the East India Company for a number of years, the Surat mint finally came under direct control of the Company in 1800. Gold mohurs, silver rupees, and fractional values were struck in the name of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II bearing the frozen regnal year 46. The Surat mint was finally closed down in 1815.Fred Pridmore (1975). The Coins of the British Commonwealth of Nations (to the end of the reign of George VI, 1952). Part 4: India, Volume 1: East India Company Presidency Series c1642 ‚Äì 1835. Spink and Son Ltd, London. A number of privy marks consisting of dots, crescents, and crown-like symbols were used and are helpful in correct attribution of the striking period and mint. Copper coinage : English machine stuck and local dump issues Machine milled issues Bengal Presidency Double Mohur Even though the British had established a trading post at Fort William (in modern-day Kolkata), Bengal Presidency acquired its proper form after the Battle of Buxar in 1764. As an outcome of the Indian defeat, Shuja-ud-Daula of Oudh and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II signed the Treaty of Allahabad, granting the East India Company rights to collect revenues from large parts of eastern India. Early Bengal Presidency issues were stuck under the name of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II, and later Shah Alam II. The monetary system followed (which was to be an Indian standard till 1 April 1957) was, * 1 pie = pice = anna * 1 pice = anna = rupee * 1 anna = rupee * 15 rupees (approximately) = 1 mohur Imperial coinage After the Indian Rebellion of 1857‚Äì58, the administration of British India was transferred from the East India Company to the British Crown. From 1862 till Indian independence in 1947, circulation coins were minted under the direct authority of the Crown. The early imperial issued coins continued to bear a fixed date, for example, rupee coins with the year 1862. This practice was intended to discourage the prevalent 'batta' system, i.e., a heavy penalty imposed by money changers or 'shroffs' on coins bearing an older date to account for wear and weight loss, irrespective of the actual condition of the coin. Victoria Queen and EmpressGold coinage= Victoria Queen one mohur, dated 1862, Calcutta mint. Early gold coinage with Queen Victoria's crowned bust consisted of one mohur coins dated 1862. These coins were of the same weight (11.66 grams = one Tola) and fineness (0.9167) as the EIC issued mohurs. These coins, probably minted between 1866 and 1869, were trade coinage and not recognized as legal tender. A number of varieties (including proofs) are known with minor variations in the reverse and obverse decoration details. 'Victoria Queen' mohurs were also struck with the year 1875, as well as 1870 proof issues with a mature bust of Victoria. In 1876, Victoria assumed the title of 'Empress of India' and, from 1877, the legend on the obverse of all coins was changed to 'Victoria Empress'. Gold mohurs with the new obverse legend were issued between 1877 and 1891. The mintage of these mohurs for any given date is relatively low, making them considerably scarce. Fractional values of the mohur (nominally valued at fifteen silver rupees) were also struck in denominations of ten and five rupees between 1870 and 1879. Except for a small number of ten and five rupees dated 1870, most of the fractional mohurs were proof issues. Varieties with both the younger and mature busts exist. =Silver coinage= Type-set of Queen Victoria coins, silver and copper, all dated 1862. The one rupee coin, struck at the Bombay mint, has 2 dots below the top flower and 0 dots above the bottom flower (2/0). Currency and proof issues of the 1862 dated rupee coins have a number of different obverse and reverse die varieties, which are helpful in identification of the mint. The design of the coin, however, remained largely unchanged. From 1863 till 1875, the Bombay mint introduced an unusual system of dots to date the coins. These dots occur on the reverse below the date, above the word 'ONE', or in both positions. From 1874, this practice was halted and coins began to be dated continuously. From this development, it may be inferred that by this time the 'batta' system must have all but disappeared. As with all other Victoria coinage, the title on the obverse was changed from 'Victoria Queen' to 'Victoria Empress' in 1877. Calcutta mint coins usually carry no mint mark or an incused 'C' at the bottom of the reverse. Bombay mint issues are usually marked by a raised bead below the date, or a raised/incused 'B' in the top or bottom flower, with some exceptions. Rupee coins with Victoria's bust were minted until her death in 1901. Fractional denominations of half rupee, quarter rupee, and two annas were also issued under Victoria's reign. The dot- dating system was not used for these denominations, and is unique to the 1862 dated Bombay rupees. Similar to the rupee coins, the title of Queen was changed to Empress in 1877. The Bombay and Calcutta issues have mint identification marks similar to the rupee issues (no mark or 'C' incused for Calcutta, bead or raised/incused 'B' for Bombay). Different reverse and obverse die varieties are known for each denomination. Edward VIIGeorge VEdward VIII During the short reign of Edward VIII, no coins were issued in India bearing his portrait. However several coins were issued by the states of Kutch and Jodphur that bore his name in Indian Script. Several coins bearing the portrait of Edward VIII are sometimes offered for sale on online auction sites, but these \\"coins\\" are almost certainly modern productions and were never officially issued. George VI 1939 rupee change in silver content wartime measures Coins of the following denominations were issued: * Anna ( Pice) * Pice * Anna * Pice ( Anna) * Anna * Anna * 2 Annas * 4 Annas ( Rupee) * Rupee * 8 Annas ( Rupee) * Rupee * One Rupee * 5 Rupees ( Mohur) * 10 Rupees ( Mohur) * 15 Rupees (Mohur) * 30 Rupees (2 Mohur) * British Gold Sovereign, as an emergency war issue, in 1918. There are many rare coins of this period which interests coin collectors. The 1939 Rupee is the most expensive rupee, as after 1939 all silver coins effectively became less pure, due to the shortage of silver during World War II. The 1947 Rupee, half rupee, quarter rupee and Anna coins are also of special interest to collectors, since that was the last year British issued coins were circulated in India.

Campbell was a sternwheel steamboat built in Seattle in 1898 which ran on the Yukon and tributary rivers in Alaska.  Construction D.R. Campbell was built at the shipyard of Robert Moran, a successful shipbuilder in Seattle, Washington. Named for David Rae Campbell (1830‚Äì1911), a Maine wool manufacturer who financed the Seattle-Yukon Transportation Co. D.R. Campbell was one of twelve nearly identical sternwheelers built at the same time at the Moran yard. These vessels were built to take advantage of the huge demand for inland shipping that was caused by the Klondike Gold Rush. All the vessels were launched the same day, April 23, 1898, everyone with steam up in the boiler. The vessels were all complete by about May 25, 1898. Transfer to Alaska All twelve vessels were assembled at Roche Harbor to clear customs, that being the most northerly customs house from which to begin the transfer north, which they were to make under their own power. Robert Moran himself was on the lead boat, Pilgrim, which was under the command of Capt. Edward Lennan, a highly skilled Alaska pilot. Accompanying the flotilla were the steam tugs Richard Holyoke and Resolute, the steam schooner South Coast, and six supply barges. The long voyage to the mouth of the Yukon River on the Bering Sea was difficult and one of the vessels (Western Star) was wrecked en route. Career on the Yukon D.R. Campbell arrived at Dawson, Yukon, on September 8, 1898, with a 400-ton barge. The vessel was worked on the Yukon River runs from Dawson to Fairbanks, Alaska, and also from Dawson over the whole course of the Yukon downriver to St. Michael, Alaska. D.R. Campbell was originally owned by the Seattle-Yukon Transportation Company but was transferred to the Northern Navigation Company in 1901. The vessel was acquired by White Pass in 1914 but was not used under White Pass ownership. White Pass sold the Campbell, and the vessel was abandoned by its new owner at St. Michael Canal, Alaska in 1927.

Bush, the Task Force on New Americans is an interagency initiative to help immigrants learn English, embrace the common core of American civic culture, and fully become American. Established within the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Michael Chertoff serves as Chair of the Task Force. Membership includes representatives from 12 Cabinet-level departments and a technical working committee of eight additional federal agencies. Alfonso Aguilar, Chief of the Office of Citizenship at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), serves as Chair of the Task Force‚Äôs technical committee. Since it was established more than three years ago, the Task Force has worked to develop interagency initiatives to help immigrants settle in their new country and maximize the use of federal resources in promoting integration. By providing technical resources to communities and organizations, encouraging volunteerism, developing effective training methods, conducting targeted research efforts, and providing recommendations to the President, the Task Force has sought to encourage successful immigrant assimilation in a comprehensive manner. Improved access to information and resources for new immigrants As a major Task Force initiative, the New Americans Project, seeks to encourage volunteerism among both U.S. citizens and new immigrants. The Task Force accomplished this through, among other projects, a zip code- based search engine listing volunteer opportunities to work with immigrants and a series of outreach events to promote volunteerism. In addition, the New Americans Project aims to provide opportunities for immigrants themselves to integrate into their communities by volunteering. The Task Force worked closely with the White House Office of USA Freedom Corps on this initiative. Providing training and technical resources to organizations that serve immigrants The Task Force has provided public libraries, adult educators, and volunteers with training and resources to assist them in establishing programs to help immigrants settle in and learn about the United States. * During 2007-2008, the Task Force began offering grants of educational materials, in the form of the Civics and Citizenship Toolkit, to immigrant- serving organizations. Initially provided to public libraries, the Toolkit is now available free of charge to all established immigrant-serving organizations through the website www.citizenshiptoolkit.gov. Since September 2007, more than 15,000 copies of the Toolkit have been distributed across the country. In addition, the Government Printing Office has distributed the Toolkit to the nearly 1,300 members of the Federal Depository Library Program. * U.S. Civics and Citizenship Online: Resource Center for Instructors is a web-based tool hosted by USCIS offering teachers and volunteers a single source to locate resources to incorporate civics into English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction and prepare adult students for naturalization. The website includes links to curricula, lesson plans, teacher assessments, and other instructional material. * In October 2007, USCIS and the Department of Education introduced EL/Civics Online, a web-based electronic training module for volunteers and adult educators. This valuable training resource includes courses and materials in U.S. government, U.S. history, the naturalization process, and civic engagement. * To complement EL/Civics Online, USCIS convened more than 25 training conferences and workshops to help refine skills and prepare adult civics and citizenship instructors and volunteers for teaching American history, civics, and the naturalization process to immigrant students. More than 2,000 volunteers and adult educators have received this important training. Gather input and provide recommendations on successful integration practices In February 2007, the Task Force began holding a series of roundtable discussions across the United States to learn more about successful immigrant integration practices. These roundtables helped gather input from immigrant-serving organizations, businesses, state and local governments, academia, community and faith-based organizations, adult educators, public libraries, foundations, and traditional civic organizations. Following these discussions, and with the collective experience and research of its members, the Task Force released a report entitled, Building an Americanization Movement for the Twenty-first Century: A Report to the President of the United States from the Task Force on New Americans. The report recommends strengthening assimilation efforts across the nation and among all sectors of society. The integration efforts described in this report are a federal call to action that defines a modern-day Americanization movement. Task Force membership The Task Force consists of 12 cabinet- level departments and a technical working committee of eight federal agencies.

He was an archaeologist primarily associated with the Southeastern United States and Florida, and in his later years he was known as the \\"dean of Floridian archaeology\\".Figueredo, Alfredo E.

Early and personal life  Ripley Pierce Bullen was born September 21, 1902, in Winthrop, Massachusetts. His parents were Dana Ripley Bullen and Bessie Louise Pierce. He had a humble childhood growing up in the Bay State. Referred to as \\"Rip\\" by his childhood friends, a name that would stick with him throughout his life, Bullen was always known for his enthusiasm towards anything that he pursued. Bullen met his life partner, Adelaide Kendall, while working in Massachusetts. Adelaide Kendall was a cultural and physical anthropologist.Wilkerson, Jeffery K. 1978. Bullen, Ripley, Pierce 1902-1976. American Antiquity. 43:4:622-631. A few years later, in 1929, they married. The couple raised two sons, Dana Ripley II and Pierce Kendall. Bullen was also a grandfather of four. Mrs. Bullen worked alongside her husband on numerous projects including the founding of their publishing company, Kendall Books. She also researched and wrote articles with her husband.  Education and early career  At an early age Bullen was interested in both archaeology and engineering. He attended Schenectady High School in New York, graduating in 1921, after which he attended Cornell University, where he received a master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1925. Later that year, Bullen landed his first job with General Electric. Over the next decade he worked in their engineering research department before he transitioned into sales for General Electric, where he worked in New York and Massachusetts for a few years. During his tenure at GE, Bullen continued his fascination with archaeology. Finding time between being a father and his paying job at GE, he managed to participate in his first excavation at a steatite quarry in 1939. Bullen's first jump into professional archeology was as an organizer for the Massachusetts Archaeological Society, where he would give numerous presentations about his work and findings to that organization and at meetings of the Society for American Archaeology.  Archeological career  In 1940, after working for the General Electric Company for fifteen years, Bullen left his job to professionally pursue archaeology. He worked for the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for the next eight years. While in that position, Bullen took part in the University of New Mexico's archaeology field school studies in Chaco Canyon. He also worked towards a doctorate in anthropology and served as a Teaching Fellow for two years at Harvard University. Bullen rose to some prominence through his many published articles during his time with the Robert S. Peabody Foundation, where he created the basic cultural chronology for eastern Massachusetts. In 1948 Bullen and his family made the long move south to Florida, where he accepted an offer to become an assistant archaeologist for the Florida Board of Park and Historic Memorials. A few years later, the Florida Museum of Natural History established an Anthropology Department, and Bullen became its first archaeologist. With the creation of the department, many of Bullen's excavation collections as well as other collections and records from the Florida Park Service were relocated to the Museum of Natural History. In 1956, Bullen accepted the chairmanship of the Department of Social Sciences at the Florida Museum of Natural History. While chairing the Department, Bullen participated in a number of excavations sponsored by the William L. Bryant Foundation and the National Park Service in St. John and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Bullen published several articles and monographs on the islands' prehistory and became one of the first archaeologists to study and excavate in the Caribbean islands. Some of Bullen's compiled collections from his work are still housed in the Florida Museum of Natural History. A few years later, Bullen began to compile research for a projectile point guide of Florida's prehistoric cultures, which was first published in 1968. This became his most notable and most widely cited work. Bullen guided the department as chairman for seventeen years until his retirement in 1973. Although officially retired, he continued to work and was honored as Curator Emeritus at the University of Florida in 1976. The \\"Bullen Medal for outstanding future anthropologists\\" was established in his honor by the University of Florida. From 1970 to 1976, Bullen became the head editor of the Florida Anthropological Society's journal, the Florida Anthropologist.Florida Museum of Natural History. \\"History of the Florida Collections.\\" Retrieved Mar 26, 2011, from http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/flarch/history.htm He was the editor of the organization's journal until his death on December 25, 1976. In addition to being editor of a major anthropological journal, Bullen was the author of more than two hundred books, monographs and articles.Bullen, Adelaide K. Bibliography of Ripley P. Bullen. 1978. Kendall Books.  Bullen projectile point typology  In the late 1960s Bullen began developing his point typology of Floridian prehistory to aid fellow archaeologists with point classification. The first report of Bullen's Florida projectile point classification was presented to the Florida Anthropological Society in 1967. The presentation went so well that the projectile point classification system which started as a reference guide grew to a small monograph and was then published by the Florida Museum of Natural History in 1968. In the introduction of his collection, Bullen stated, \\"students of projectile points wished considerably more detailed information than had been originally contemplated. At the risk of making this guide too lengthy, the author has tried to please all, partially if not completely\\" (Bullen 1968:2).Bullen, Ripley P. 1968. A guide to the identification of Florida projectile points. Florida State Museum, Gainesville, Florida. (50 pp.) The first edition recognized a wide range of projectile point types. The number continued to grow as Bullen continued his research on the subject. In 1975, with much more researched point types, Bullen published the second edition of his point guide through Kendall Books, a company formed together with his wife. The Bullen Projectile Point Typology remains a key tool for Florida and southeastern archaeologists.  Award and honors  In March 1976, Bullen was awarded a degree of Doctorate of Science by the University of Florida. This honorary degree was in recognition of his many contributions to the archaeological world, especially work completed in Florida and for the University. In the same year the Ripley P. Bullen award, sometimes referred to as the Bullen Medal, was established by the University of Florida to honor outstanding students within the archeological field. The Bullen Award is given in honor of Ripley P. Bullen for his work with the Florida Museum. The recipients of the Bullen Award are chosen by the Florida Museum's university teaching committee. The award is bestowed to students involved with or conducting museum based research for excellence in research of the anthropology of Florida and the Caribbean Basin.

He was born in London on 15 March 1856, and, at first, educated at the Rev. C. A. Johns's school at Winchester, and then at Repton. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 October 1874, but took no degree, leaving to enter the business of Messrs. Melly & Co., merchants, of Liverpool. He was of adventurous disposition, and joined in Fiji in October 1879 Sir Arthur Gordon, the governor. On 12 November he accompanied his chief to Tonga, and, in December, to Rotumah, in connection with the annexation of that island. He arrived again in Fiji on 17 April 1880, and returned to Rotumah on 18 September 1880 as deputy-commissioner on its annexation to the British crown. In early 1881, owing to continued ill-health, he rejoined Sir Arthur Gordon, who had gone to New Zealand as governor, but in March he was appointed deputy-commissioner for the Western Pacific, and started for his first long tour through these seas in H.M.S. Beagle. He visited New Hanover, the Admiralty group, Hermit Islands, Astrolabe Bay in New Guinea, the Louisiade archipelago, Woodlark Islands, and the Trobriands. After a visit on sick leave to England, succeeded by a short stay in Fiji, he was ordered to New Guinea for the first time, at the end of 1883. In November 1884 he was one of the party which declared the British protectorate over part of New Guinea. By some misunderstanding he hoisted the British flag in advance of the formal declaration of protectorate. He gave effective aid in the early administration of the new colony, and on the death of the chief administrator, Sir Peter Scratchley, he acted as administrator in charge of the settlement from December 1885 to the end of February 1886, but went to London in June to supervise the New Guinea exhibits at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. For these services he was created a C.M.G. On 17 Jan. 1887 he once again started for the Pacific, staying en route in Egypt and Australia, and in June took up the appointment of deputy-commissioner and consul of the New Hebrides and Solomon Islands, residing chiefly at Port Moresby, New Guinea. His task during 1888 and 1889 was peculiarly trying. There was a good deal of native hostility, and he was much isolated, owing largely, he believed, to the neglect of the home authorities. Finally, in 1890, he resigned his offices. In 1891 Romilly went out to Africa in command of an expedition for the Northumberland Mining Syndicate, and travelled for some time in Mashonaland. While there he contracted fever, and, returning home, died at Cecil Street, Strand, London, on 27 July 1892. He was unmarried. Romilly is described by Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore as of \\"a quick intelligence, great physical strength, and an easy temper.\\" His writings prove that he possessed all the qualifications for an explorer of new lands and a student of native ways.

It is the most widely used mono-pyridylphosphine ligand. Other mono-pyridylphosphines ligands (3-, 4-) are not common in chemical literature; however, tris-pyridylphosphines have been thoroughly investigated as ligands in transition metal complexes used for catalysis. Pyridylphosphines, including diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine, may bind transition metals as monodentate or bidentate ligands4. Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine behaves as a P-bound monodentate ligand, or a P,N-bound bidentate ligand. Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine is a sought after ligand for its ability to relay protons to transition metals such as palladium(II) in homogeneous catalysis. Synthesis Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine is prepared from 2-lithiopyridine with chlorodiphenylphosphine: Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine is an integral ligand in the Pd(II) catalyzed carbonylation of alkynes. The pi-donor ability of one bidentate P,N-coordinated ligand is highly stabilizing to the metal center. While a second monodentate, N-protonated ligand transfers protons to the metal to be used in catalysis. The role of the pyridyl group in this catalytic cycle is evident when the ligand is replaced by triphenyl phosphine, and rates of catalysis a greatly decreased. This catalytic process is an important step in the production of polymers, and other fine chemicals.

They have taken on varying roles in society, including warriors, nurses, mothers and wives. There have been many advances in women's rights in Vietnam, such as an increase in women representation in government, as well as the creation of the Vietnam Women's Union in 1930. During the 19th century, Vietnam was dominated by French rule. Some women were temporarily married to European men during this period, with both parties seeing the union as mutually beneficial. In the early 20th century, nationalist sentiments rose in Vietnam that eventually led to the end of French rule in 1954 and divided Vietnam into two along the seventeenth parallel. The role of women in warfare and outside the home continued to increase throughout the 20th century, especially during the Indochina Wars. During and after the Vietnam War, the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam made efforts to increase women's rights, equity, and representation in government. This included the creation of job quotas during the 1960s, which required that women occupy a certain percentage of jobs in different sectors. Women's rights have continued to increase in contemporary Vietnam, and women have increasingly held leadership positions.

However, there is still an influence of gender roles and cultural influence in Vietnam today, which persists both inside the domestic home as well as outside in the socioeconomic sphere. History before the Vietnam War=Early history and Chinese rule According to William S. Turley, \\"the role of women in traditional Vietnamese culture was determined [partly] by ... indigenous customs bearing traces of matriarchy\\",Turley, William S., Women in the Communist Revolution in Vietnam, in Asian Survey, vol. 12, no. 9, September, 1972, p. 793 n. 1 (DOI 10.2307/2642829) (author asst. prof. gov't, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), in JStor, as accessed December 29, 2013 (database). affecting \\"different social classes\\" to ying degrees\\". According to Chiricosta, the legend of √Çu C∆° is said to be evidence of \\"the presence of an original 'matriarchy' in North Vietnam and [it] led to the double kinship system, which developed there .... [and which] combined matrilineal and patrilineal patterns of family structure and assigned equal importance to both lines.\\"Chiricosta, Alessandra, Following the Trail of the Fairy-Bird: The Search For a Uniquely Vietnamese Women's Movement, in Roces, Mina, & Louise P. Edwards, eds., Women's Movements in Asia, op. cit., p. 125 and see p. 126 (single quotation marks so in original). In 111 B.C., Chinese armies claimed the territory called Nam Viet and tried to integrate it into the Han Empire. During this time, Confucianism was the official ideology, the Chinese language was primarily spoken, and the Chinese occupation had enormous influence on literature and art creations. However, there was resistance to the Chinese rule. According to Peter C. Phan, that \\"the first three persons leading insurrections against China were women ... that ancient Vietnam was a matriarchal society\\"Phan, Peter C., Vietnamese-American Catholics (New York or Mahwah, New Jersey: Paulist Press, 2005 ()), p. 12 and see pp. 13 & 32 (author prof. Catholic social thought, Georgetown Univ.) (the \\"three persons\\" apparently being the sisters Trung Trac and Trung Nhi in A.D. 40, per p. 12, & Trieu Au in A.D. 248, per p. 13). and \\"the ancient Vietnamese family system was most likely matriarchal, with women ruling over the clan or tribe\\"Phan, Peter C., Vietnamese-American Catholics, op. cit., p. 32. until the Vietnamese the patriarchal system introduced by the Chinese\\", although \\"this patriarchal system ... was not able to dislodge the Vietnamese women from their relatively high position in the family and society, especially among the peasants and the lower classes\\", with modern \\"culture and legal codes ... [promoting more] rights and privileges\\" for women than in Chinese culture.Phan, Peter C., Vietnamese-American Catholics, op. cit., p. 33. Chiricosta said that other scholars relied on \\"this 'matriarchal' aspect of the myth to differentiate Vietnamese society from the pervasive spread of Chinese Confucian patriarchy\\"Roces, Mina, & Louise P. Edwards, eds., Women's Movements in Asia, op. cit., p. 125 and see p. 125 n. 2 (single quotation marks so in original). and that \\"resistance to China's colonization of Vietnam ... [combined with] the view that Vietnam was originally a matriarchy ...

A female military leader who managed, for a time, to successfully resist the Chinese state of Eastern Wu during its occupation of Vietnam, she is quoted as saying, \\"I'd like to ride storms, kill sharks in the open sea, drive out the aggressors, reconquer the country, undo the ties of serfdom, and never bend my back to be the concubine of whatever man.\\":vi:Nguy·ªÖn Kh·∫Øc Vi·ªán (1913-1997), Vietnam, a long history, The Gioi Publishers, reprinted 2002, p. 22.Helle Rydstr√∏m -Embodying Morality: Growing Up in Rural Northern Vietnam - Page 179 2003 \\"Among the Chinese, Trieu Thi Trinh was portrayed as a monster with three-meter long breasts and riding an elephant ..\\" When the enemy is at the gate, the woman goes out fighting. has been recited as evidence of women's stature. (Giac den nha dan ba phai danh) - an old Vietnamese adage. The quote is \\"giac den nha, dan ba cung danh\\" in Vietnamese and the quote actually means that fighting in war is inappropriate for women and its only when the situation is so desperate that the war has spread to their home then women should enter the war. Tr∆∞ng sisters In A.D. 40, the Tr∆∞ng Sisters Tr∆∞ng Tr·∫Øc and Tr∆∞ng Nh·ªã led a rebellion to get rid of T√¥ ƒê·ªãnh, the corrupt Chinese governor occupying Vietnam. They were daughters of a L·∫°c lord in Giao Ch·ªâ (now Northern Vietnam) and widows of aristocrats. They successfully formed their own kingdom in M√™ Linh, where Tr∆∞ng Tr·∫Øc was proclaimed queen, and a capital was built for her\\". While ruling in M√™ Linh, the sisters abolished taxes, which had been especially cruel under T√¥ ƒê·ªãnh. They were defeated in A.D. 43 by Ma Yuan, a Chinese general, but are still regarded as female military heroes and national heroines. According to Donald M. Seekins, an indication of \\"the strength of matriarchal values\\"Seekins, Donald M., \\"Trung Sisters, Rebellion of (39‚Äì43)\\", in Sandler, Stanley, ed., Ground Warfare: An International Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara California: ABC-Clio, hardcover 2002 ()), vol. 3, p. 898, col. 1 (author of Seekins of Meio University). was that a woman, Tr∆∞ng Tr·∫Øc, with her younger sister Tr∆∞ng Nh·ªã, raised an army of \\"over 80,000 soldiers .... [in which] many of her officers were women\\", with which they defeated the Chinese. According to Keith Weller Taylor, \\"the matriarchal flavor of the time is ... attested by the fact that Tr∆∞ng Tr·∫Øc's mother's tomb and spirit temple have survived, although nothing remains of her father\\",Taylor, Keith Weller, The Birth of Vietnam (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983 ()), p. 39 (n. 176 omitted). and the \\"society of the Trung sisters\\" was \\"strongly matrilineal\\".Both quotations: Taylor, Keith Weller, The Birth of Vietnam, op. cit., p. 338. On the other hand, even though the Tr∆∞ng sisters are remembered for their military skills and bravery, they have also been used to confirm women's societal role in a different manner. Some historians have focused on their physical beauty and emphasized their devotion to family as well as Tr∆∞ng Tr·∫Øc's romantic relationship with her husband, L·∫°c lord Thi Sach. As an iconic symbol of Vietnamese patriotism, they were used to show how weak Vietnamese men are even in comparison to Vietnamese women, as the Vietnamese men under T√¥ ƒê·ªãnh \\"bowed their heads, folded their arms, and served the northerners; how shameful is this in comparison with the two Trung sisters, who were women!\\"Ng√¥ S√Ø Li√™n, Dai Viet sir ky to√†n thw, 3, lb. Cited in The Birth of Vietnam by Keith Weiler Taylor (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983), p. 334. After Ma Yuan's defeat of the Tr∆∞ng sisters, the Chinese maintained domination over Vietnam for more than a thousand years. They established a bureaucracy that emphasized Confucianism, and they focused on educating Vietnam's ruling class with Chinese literature and ideas. Chinese rule ended in 939 AD when the Vietnamese army, under the direction of Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn, defeated the Chinese army, which was already troubled by chaos within China.\\"Vietnam History, People, Economy, Geography, Government.\\" N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Apr. 2014. The L√Ω dynasty was established in 1010, and ruled until 1225. The Ly dynasty continued many of the political, social, and economic institutions that were imposed by the country's former Chinese rulers. For example, only males of the noble class could attend school and become members of the civil service. The Vietnamese continued to fight against Chinese influence, but in 1407 the country was once again under Chinese Rule. They re-won independence in 1428, when the Vietnamese L√™ dynasty was created. Champa king Po Rome was Cru and had a Malay wife, a Vietnamese wife, a Ra-Nde wife and Cham Awal wife. Hos Vietnamese wife was Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ng·ªçc Khoa (ÈòÆÁ¶èÁéâË™á), daughter of Nguy·ªÖn Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Nguy√™n. He was so into his sexual relations with her that he had Champa's sacred Kraik tree chopped down to cure her of illness. This enabled the Vietnamese to defeat the Cham, leading to his suicide after the Vietnamese held him in a metal cage when the Vietnamese army defeated the Chams due to the destruction of the Kraik tree leading Champa's power to be sapped. The Cambodian King Chey Chettha II married the Vietnamese Nguy·ªÖn lord Princess Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ng·ªçc V·∫°n, a daughter of Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Nguy√™n, in 1618.Mai Th·ª•c, V∆∞∆°ng mi·ªán l∆∞u ƒë√†y: truy·ªán l·ªãch s·ª≠, Nh√† xu·∫•t b·∫£n VƒÉn h√≥a - th√¥ng tin, 2004, p.580; Gi√°o s∆∞ Ho√†ng Xu√¢n Vi·ªát, Nguy·ªÖn Minh Ti·∫øn hi·ªáu ƒë√≠nh, T√¨m hi·ªÉu l·ªãch s·ª≠ ch·ªØ qu·ªëc ng·ªØ, Ho Chi Minh City, C√¥ng ty VƒÉn h√≥a H∆∞∆°ng Trang, pp.31-33; Helen Jarvis, Cambodia, Clio Press, 1997, p.xxiii. In return, the king granted the Vietnamese the right to establish settlements in M√¥ Xo√†i (now B√† R·ªãa), in the region of Prey Nokor‚Äîwhich they colloquially referred to as S√†i G√≤n, and which later became Ho Chi Minh City. The Ming loyalist Chinese pirate Yang Yandi and his fleet sailed to Vietnam to leave the Qing dynasty in March 1682, first appearing off the coast of Tonkin in north Vietnam. According to the Vietnamese account, V≈© Duy Ch√≠ Ê≠¶ÊÉüÂøó, a minister of the Vietnamese L√™ dynasty came up with a plan to defeat the Chinese pirates by sending more than 300 Vietnamese girls who were beautiful singing girls and prostitutes with red handkerchiefs to go to the Chinese pirate junks on small boats. The Chinese pirates and northern Vietnamese girls had sex but the Vietnamese women then wet the gun barrels of the Chinese pirates ships with their handkerchiefs which they got wet. They then left in the same boats. The Vietnamese navy then attacked the Chinese pirate fleet which was unable to fire back with their wet guns. The Chinese pirate fleet, originally 206 junks, was reduced to 50-80 junks by the time it reached south Vietnam's Quang Nam and the Mekong delta. The Chinese pirates having sex with north Vietnamese women may also have transmitted a deadly epidemic from China to the Vietnamese which ravaged the Tonkin regime of north Vietnam. French and Chinese sources say a typhoon contributed to the loss of ships along with the disease. European rule France desired trading freedom in Vietnam. They also wanted to bring more missionaries into the country. The Nguyen dynasty disliked French involvement in Vietnam, and executed several missionaries and Vietnamese coverts. This spurred the French Emperor, Napoleon III, to attack Vietnam and attempt to force the court to accept the title of \\"French protectorate.\\" The French were successful despite the resistance they encountered, and by the 1880s Vietnam was officially a French protectorate. Vietnamese women were often married to European men. This was particularly true in the upper-class, where marriage to a European male was seen as an opportunity for advancement. Often, this marriage was a temporary arrangement. A Vietnamese women married a European man for a certain amount of time. Since objects like clothes, coins, or jewelry were given in exchange for sex, women could make a profit in this way. When their European husband left, the woman were often remarried. This was seen as a profitable arrangement for most parties. In fact, Vietnamese nobles had \\"thought it no Shame or Disgrace to marry their daughters to English and Dutch Seamen, for the Time they were to stay in Tonquin, and often presented their Son in Law pretty hand- somely at their departure, especially if they left their Wives with Child.\\" In this way, the marriage and subsequent departure of a foreign husband was seen as an opportunity for social advancement, and there wasn't a stigma surrounding the \\"abandoned wife.\\" There was almost an aura surrounding a woman who married a foreign man, rather than a stigma. It was believed that \\"When [a trader] wants to depart he gives whatever is promised, and so they leave each other in friendship and she may then look for another man as she wishes in all propriety, without scandal.\\"0H. A. van Foreest and A. de Booy, eds., De Vierde Schipvaart derNederlanders naar Oost-Indi√É\\" onder Jacob Wilkens en Jacob van Neck (1599-1604) (The Hague: Linschoten Vereeniging, 1980), 223; and Hamilton, A New Account, 2:115. According to many historians, European men perceived Southeast Asian women as beautiful, but immodest and not concerned with chastity.9 Edward H. Sch√§fer, The Vermilion Bird: Tang Images of the South (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), 80; Blair and Robertson, eds., The Philippine Islands, 97-98; and Dampier, A New Voyage, 226. This facilitated an environment more open to rape and abduction. European religious leaders began blaming East Asian women for being prostitutes, and the temporary marriages came to be seen as shameful instead of honorable. They were labeled as \\"prostitutes\\" and assumed to be of the lower-classes. Historian Barbara Andaya said that although \\"well into the nineteenth century Europeans continued to take concubines, the tendency to see concubines akin to prostitutes meant that the standing of the temporary wife had been fundamentally eroded.\\" Vietnamese Nationalist movement In 1930, urban intellectual elites began to talk about women's ability to escape their confined social sphere through novels like Nhat Linh's Noan Tuyet, in which the heroine escapes from a marriage she was coerced into and wins social approval for it. The heroine's true love was a member of the nationalist party. According to this book and other authors like Phan Boi Chau, there was an evident link between the nationalist movement and an increase in women's rights. Following the nationalist military leadership of the Trung sisters, other women became heavily involved in non-communist nationalist movements, especially in the Vietnam Nationalist Party. By the end of the 1930s, women's liberation had become a common topic in the literature written by urban intellectual elites, and women had entered political life.Turley, William S. \\"Women in the Communist Revolution in Vietnam.\\" Asian Survey 12.9 (1972): 793-805. JSTOR. Web. 30 Mar. 2014. <>. The Lao Dong party (Vietnam Worker's Party) was created in 1945 after the Indochinese Party was dissolved. It was led by Ho Chi Minh until his death, and controlled the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Lao Dong Party claims to have advanced women's rights by publicizing Vietnamese women's achievements and allowing women to serve in the government and communist delegations. The party advocated and pushed for greater equality between the sexes, and said that the prior wave of women's liberation movements in the upper bourgeoisie during the 1930s was more of an advocacy for quick divorce, and did not attempt to liberate women as a whole. It said, \\"petty-bourgeois feminists reduced the cause of the inequality of the sexes and the bondage of women to economic dependence. They timidly suggested that the woman be trained in certain trades 'in keeping with her femininity and not detrimental to her mission as a mother.' (Dam Phuong, The Woman and the Family, 1929). This 'sacred mission' was in fact but domestic slavery, the drudgrey that was the lot of women in patriarchal families, which the feminists did not dare to oppose. And they hardly dared to mention this 'risky' question: that of liberation from foreign rule.\\"Dam Phuong, The Woman and the Family, 1929 Nationalist movements like the Lao Dong Party used the liberation of women to show where they planned to lead the country and emphasized the poor rights for women during colonial rule and under French influence. These nationalist movements stressed the idea that women were oppressed under the French occupation and espoused the idea that liberation for women could only come through a nationalist revolution. They recognized that gender equality was an issue that cut across social lines and could be used to build nationalist support. However, when the Party Central Committee was asked to rank the ten \\"essential tasks of the revolution,\\" it ranked equal rights for women as ninth and its stance on women's rights was intentionally vague. Even so, women did participate in the revolution against the French that occupied Vietnam. They served as nurses, guides, couriers, and propagandists. Although they were not allowed in the regular army, they fought in militia and guerrilla units on the home front. The slogan for women in the Resistance was \\"Let women replace men in all tasks in the rear, which was an accurate description of their main role in the Revolution- laboring in the agricultural sector as Vietnamese men fought for Vietnam's independence from the French. The Revolution did not result in immediate empowerment, as only 10 of the 403 seats in the 1946 -1960 Nationalist Assemblies were occupied by women. It did spread feminist ideology, however. The French left Vietnam in 1954, after an eight-year war that split Vietnam in half at the seventeenth parallel. The Vietminh were in the North, and the French and those who supported them were in the south. The North became a communist society, while the South was anti-communist and received support from the United States. Rising unrest in the South, because of religious and social intolerance by President Ngo Dinh Diem, created an opportunity for North Vietnam to try reclaiming the South. This led to a long and bloody conflict, in which American troops became very involved. In 1975, the Communist government was able to take over South Vietnam, despite the American bombing of Northern cities. This division did not remain for long, though, and the two sides were united in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976. Vietnam War (1955‚Äì1975)=Gender relations before the Vietnam War The Woman's Union of the 1930s pushed for women's interests and managed to extend paid maternity leave for government employees. The Woman's Union also received a governmental guarantee that they would be consulted before the government implemented any policies that could affect women's health. The Woman's Union is one of the few organizations that pushed for such change, and they experienced pushback on their efforts. The paid maternity leave for government employees, which was extended from three to six months, was changed back to three months a few years after its passing. Vietnam was slowly extending greater rights to females. In 1949, the state of Vietnam was created during the first Indochina War, in which Vietnam attempted to gain independence from France. A move towards equality was evident in the original constitution of the 1949 Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which stated that \\"women are equal to men in all respects.\\" The Constitution also contained clauses calling for paid maternity leave and equal pay for equal work. The 1959 Marriage and Family Law made further progress as it worked on ending systems of concubines, child marriage and forced marriage. While these changes occurred in large part because socialist leaders wanted women to be able to work in the industrial and agricultural sectors, they did promote rapid change in women's traditional roles. Under the socialist regime, both male and female literacy increased.Goodkind, Daniel. \\"Rising gender inequality in Vietnam since reunification.\\" Pacific Affairs (1995): 342-359. Women in war Women played a significant role in defending Vietnam during the Indochina Wars from 1945 to 1975. They took roles such as village patrol guards, intelligence agents, propagandists, and military recruiters. Historically, women have become \\"active participants\\" in struggles to liberate their country from foreign occupation, from Chinese to French colonialists. This character and spirit of Vietnamese women were first exemplified by the conduct of the Trung sisters, one of the \\"first historical figures\\" in the history of Vietnam who revolted against Chinese control. North Vietnamese women were enlisted and fought in the combat zone and provided manual labor to keep the Ho Chi Minh trail open. They also worked in the rice fields in North Vietnam and Viet Cong-held farming areas in South Vietnam's Mekong Delta region to provide food for their families and the communist war effort. Women were enlisted in both the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong guerrilla insurgent force in South Vietnam. Some women also served for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong intelligence services. In South Vietnam, many women voluntarily serve in the ARVN's Women's Armed Force Corps (WAFC) and various other Women's corps in the military. Some, like in the WAFC, fought in combat with other soldiers. Others have served as nurses and doctors in the battlefield and in military hospitals, or served in South Vietnam or America's intelligence agencies. During Di·ªám's presidency, Madame Nhu was the commander of the WAFC. In order to boost morale among male soldiers, North Vietnamese women were recruited from youth volunteer groups to drive truckloads of soldiers up and down the Ho Chi Minh trail, while American pilots were conducting bombing raids. The purpose of this was to show the male soldiers that if women can do it, they could as well. During the Sino-Vietnamese War Vietnamese women were used for propaganda images on both sides, as the Vietnamese released pictures of Vietnamese women militia with captured Chinese male troops while the Chinese released pictures of injured Vietnamese women prisoners being treated well by Chinese. The Chinese held 1,636 Vietnamese prisoners and the Vietnamese held 238 Chinese prisoners; they were exchanged in May‚ÄìJune 1979. The 238 Chinese male soldiers surrendered after getting separated from their main unit during the withdrawal from Vietnam and became surrounded by Vietnamese. After surrendering, they were transferred by the Vietnamese soldiers to a prison. The Chinese prisoners reported that they were subjected to torturous and inhuman treatment, such as being blindfolded and having their bodies bound and restrained with metal wire. Vietnamese women soldiers made up one-third of the guards who held the Chinese male prisoners captive in the prison. The Vietnamese arranged for foreign journalists to take photographs of Chinese male soldiers held captive by Vietnamese women militia with Type-56 rifles. Vietnam Pictorial published a collage contrasting a photo of a Vietnamese female fighter and a Chinese male prisoner with an earlier photo of a Vietnamese female fighter and American male prisoner for propaganda purposes. Some of the Vietnamese soldiers taken prisoner by China were women, and they were exchanged for the captured Chinese men. * * * * * The South Vietnamese captured Southwest Cay from the Philippines by sending Vietnamese prostitutes to distracted the Filipino soldiers at a party. Women's roles during the Vietnam War Vietnam split into two parts, North and South Vietnam, in 1954. The revolutionary socialist government in the North wanted to enhance social equity, sometimes by improving women's rights. The 1960 Marriage and Family Law, for example, banned forced marriage, child marriage, wife beating, and concubinage.Mai, T., and T. Le. Women in Vietnam. N.p.: Hanoi: Foreign Languages House, n.d. Print. The regime also focused on moving women outside of the home. They did this for the purpose of industrial development. They promoted the power of the Women's Union, which pushed for women's rights but also rallied support for the Communist government's new laws. The government of North Vietnam influenced the role of women during the war of reunification during the mid-1960s, when mobilizing women was viewed as crucial to winning the war. During this time, the Women's Union encouraged women to fulfill three main responsibilities. These were: encouraging their male relatives to fight in the war, taking all of the household burdens on themselves, and taking jobs in the industrial and agricultural workforces. In 1967, the Communist Party's Central Committee called for formal quotas in employment. The commission asked that women occupy at least 35 percent of all jobs, and 50-70 percent of jobs in education. Most of these quotas were filled by the 1970s. The Vietnam War lasted from 1956 to 1975. In 1967, with the Vietnam War well under way, the Communist Party's Central Committee in North Vietnam passed resolution 153. This resolution passed formal job quotas, requiring women to hold a minimum of 35% of all jobs and 50‚Äì70% of job in the educational sector. They passed this resolution because, with so many Vietnamese men away at war, they needed more women to support the economy. A similar infiltration occurred in the political arena, where the \\"percentage of women on people's councils, the major administrative bodies, increased at the provincial, district, and commune levels from 22.8, 20.8, and 16.5 percent in 1965 to 34.8, 40.0, and 40.9 percent by 1972.\\" Although this was the greatest involvement of women in the political sphere in Vietnam's history, men maintained their hold on leadership positions across the board, not only in the political arena. When the war ended, female involvement decreased, actually sinking below its pre-war involvement rates. Several laws influenced women's rights in the time period following the Vietnam war and reunification. The Family Law of 1986 doubled the length of maternity leave from three to six months, while the 1988 Council of Minster's Decision number 163 gave the Women's Union the right to be involved in any decision relevant to the welfare of women or children. However, the desire for economic efficiency under the free market reforms of the new regime caused some of these reforms to be scaled back. Maternity leave, for example, was shortened to four months when employers began complaining that they lost money by hiring women. There are no other organizations like the Women's Union, as the Vietnamese government is very careful about the nongovernmental organizations they allow to exist. The Vietnamese Women's Association exists largely to increase the power of the Communist Party, so it is not always able to fully support women's interests. Gender relations in post-war Vietnam In Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s, the newly-powerful socialists promoted equal access to education for men and women. The reunification of North and South Vietnam after the Vietnam War, in 1976, also allowed women to take on leadership roles in politics. One author said that Vietnam during the 1980s was \\"a place where, after exhausting work and furious struggle, women can be confident that they travel the path which will some day arrive at their liberation.\\"Arlene Eisen, Women and Revolution in Vietnam (London: Zed Books, 1984). However, some historians have argued that women's advocates in Vietnam \\"have been weakened in the post- reunification era due in part to the implementation of free market reforms in a nondemocratic political context.\\" The resource constraints were detrimnental to women's rights, as was the political atmosphere after the war. The new state implemented free market economics but political participation was not expanded. The tight political atmosphere and resource-constraints weakened the Vietnam Women's Union, which was accustomed to speaking on behalf of women under Vietnam's single-party rule. After the war was over, it was no longer seen as a crucial organization by the government. Political reunification also resulted in the end of the quota system and the subsequent decrease in women in the National Assembly. There was also an increase in occupational segregation as women returned to more roles within the home and men returned from the war.Allen, S. Country Gender Analysis: Vietnam. Hanoi: Swedish International Development Authority, 1992. Print. Free-market policies known as the ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi put female-headed households in rural areas at a disadvantage by limiting their access to credit.Tran, T. \\"The Direct Loan of Capital from the Bank to Develop Production and Gender Equality.\\" Vietnam Social Sciences. N.p.: n.p., 1992. 25-36. Print. Women in contemporary society Traditional Vietnamese country wedding ceremonyWomen occupy both the domestic and outside sector in contemporary Vietnam. Women's participation in the economy, government, and society has increased. In the domestic sphere, little progress has been made to improve gender relations. Traditional Confucian patriarchal values have continued to persist, as well as a continued emphasis on the family unit. This has comprised the main criticism of Vietnam Women's Union, an organization that works towards advancing women's rights. Furthermore, recent shifts in Vietnam's sex ratio show an increased number of men outnumbering women, which many researchers have stated to in part be caused by the two-child policy in Vietnam. Family Marriage = Following their colonization by European powers, many lost their standing and were placed in the domestic sphere. Instead of being involved in their society, women worked as trade intermediaries and were expected to marry and become housewives.Lockard, Craig A. Southeast Asia in World History. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. This shift in gender roles became a new cultural practice and lasted for years until the Vietnam War, when women in rural Vietnam became discouraged from marrying and female singlehood became a growing trend. A common belief was that after the mid-twenties, women were considered undesirable and marriage was a way of life. The cap for marriage was at this age because after this time, women could no longer bear children, a necessity for the survival of the family name. In addition, the notion of \\"a one-person, self-sufficient household was not very acceptable\\" Werner, Jayne Susan, and Khuat Thu Hong. \\"Too Late to Marry: Failure, Fate or Fortune? Female Singlehood in Rural North Viet Nam.\\" In Gender, Household, State: ƒë·ªèÃÇi M·ªõi in Vi·ªát Nam, 89-110. Ithaca, N.Y.: Southeast Asia Program, Cornell University, 2002. and was looked at as selfish and lonely. After the age of twenty-five, single women enter a period where they \\"make the transition from temporary to permanent non-marriage.\\" As they go through this period, society perceived them as being \\"wishful\\" or even \\"regretful\\". However, when women were interviewed, nearly all showed no sign of remorse from rejecting marriage proposals during their prime ages for marriage. They were happy with their decision to opt out of a possible \\"miserable\\" life with a husband. Familial obligations, especially during the Vietnam War, forced many women to put off marriage until they reached an age where they were viewed as \\"unfavorable\\". From a young age, the eldest child of a Vietnamese family had a variety of obligations to uphold. One of which was having to care for their younger siblings. During time of war, it was difficult for the parents to overlook agricultural labor while taking care of all their children. If the eldest daughter were to be married off, the family would lose a hand of labor. Because of this obligation, women rejected offerings of marriage. After the war, women continued to help around the household and replaced the men they lost in combat. Although many still had proposals for marriage, they believed that it was fate that they had been single for that long and that they were meant for singlehood. The gender imbalance that followed the Vietnam War was also a cause in the rise of single women. It was hard for them because men living in rural areas were hesitant to marry them. In addition, those who work at state farms and forestry stations were stationed in remote areas. This limited women from socializing with the opposite sex. Studies have shown there are marriage discrepancies between rural and urban areas in Vietnam today. According to Nguyen et al., women from rural areas were shown to enter marriage at a younger age than women from urban areas. Furthermore, evidence has shown that there is a difference in marital and familial values between north and south Vietnam. According to one study, these differences between the north and south regions are likely due to their separation during the mid-20th century, as well as the degree of socialist or western influences on the north and south, respectively. The cultural differences between northern and southern Vietnam include \\"marriage rituals, family living arrangement, household composition, and premarital sexual behaviors\\" according to a study by Teerawichitchainan et al. =Domestic role= Confucianism's emphasis on the family still impacts Vietnamese women's lives, especially in rural areas, where it espouses the importance of premarital female virginity and condemns abortion and divorce.Nguyen Khac Vien (1975) Confucianism and Marxism in Vietnam, in: David Marr & Jayne Werner (Eds) Tradition and Revolution in Vietnam, pp. 15‚Äì52 (Berkeley, Indochina Resources Center). According to a 2006 study, over the past decades, little progression in gender relations have been made. Household chores and labor are still primarily performed by Vietnamese women; however, women in Vietnam have shown increased influence in familial decisions, such as household budgets and the education of the children. In terms of childcare responsibility, men have shown an increased participation at the earlier ages of childcare, though women overall still bear the main responsibility. Women are seen primarily as mothers, and are considered to have shown \\"respect\\" to their husband's lineage if they give birth to a boy.Rydstr√∏m, Helle. \\"Sexual desires and ‚Äòsocial evils‚Äô: young women in rural Vietnam.\\" Gender, Place and Culture 13, no. 3 (2006): 283-301. While patrilineal ancestor worship shows girls as \\"outside lineage\\" (h·ªç ngo·∫°i), it consider boys to be \\"inside lineage\\" (h·ªç n·ªôi). Vietnamese society tends to follow the ancestral line through males, pushing women to the periphery. Vietnam has a two child policy. Some families want at least one boy, but would prefer two boys to two girls, so they use ultrasound machines to determine the baby's sex to later abort female offspring.Zeng Yi et al., \\"Causes and Implications of the Recent Increase in the Reported Sex Ratio of Birth in China,\\" Population and Development Review, vol. 19 (June 1993), pp. 283-302; Daniel Goodkind, \\"Rising Sex Ratios at Birth in Confucian Asia: A Summary of Interpretive Puzzles\\" (Unpublished manuscript, 1994). The main religion in Vietnam are traditional folk beliefs (see Vietnamese folk religion). This is not an organized religion, however it does adopt many Confucian views. One of the main views that it takes from Confucius is the Patrilineal Society. Men are the head of the family and more their lineage is to be protected. As it pertains to motherhood, Vietnam women are seen as and used primarily as mothers. Female virginity is of extreme importance, especially in rural areas, and the Society condemns abortion and female divorce. If a woman wants to show respect to her husband, the best way she can do that is to bear him a son. There are several patterns in birth rates amongst Vietnamese women. In one 2008 study by Nguyen et al., most women were found to have given birth by the time they reached age 20. However, the same study has found that the higher education level a woman received, the later the age at which she gives birth to her first child. = Domestic violence = The issue of domestic violence has faced scrutiny in Vietnam. In 2007, Vietnamese legislation passed the Law on Prevention and Control Domestic Violence, which reported that 32% of Vietnamese women have suffered sexual violence from their spouses, while 54% of women in Vietnam have suffered from emotional violence. Speculation has rose on the viability of divorce as a solution to those in situations of domestic violence. This is due to the prevalent local attitudes and measures taken towards preventing divorce in order to preserve the family unit, rather than helping victims escape domestic abuse. Additionally, surveys have indicated that 87% of domestic violence victims in Vietnam do not seek support for their situation. In a study comparing Chinese and Vietnamese attitudes towards women, more Vietnamese than Chinese said that the male should dominate the family and a wife had to provide sex to her husband at his will. Violence against women was supported by more Vietnamese than Chinese. Domestic violence was more accepted by Vietnamese women than Chinese women. = International marriage = Some Vietnamese women from L√†o Cai who married Chinese men stated that among their reasons for doing so was that Vietnamese men beat their wives, engaged in affairs with mistresses, and refused to help their wives with chores, while Chinese men actively helped their wives carry out chores and care for them. Vietnamese women are traveling to China as mail order brides for rural Chinese men to earn money for their families and a rise in the standard of living, matchmaking between Chinese men and Vietnamese women has increased and has not been effected by troubled relations between Vietnam and China.* * * * * * * * * * * * * Vietnamese mail order brides have also gone to Taiwan* * and South Korea for marriage. Several cases have occurred where Vietnamese women were abducted or deceived to be sold to Chinese men. Totalling several thousands, in a significant number of cases the victims were underage. =Sex trafficking in Vietnam= Vietnamese women and girls were mass trafficked from Vietnam to China during French colonial rule by Chinese and Vietnamese pirates and agencies. French Captain Louis de Grandmaison claimed that these Vietnamese women did not want to go back to Vietnam and they had families in China and were better off in China. Vietnamese women were in demand because of a lower amount of Chinese women available in China and along the borderlands of China there were many Chinese men who had no women and needed Vietnamese women. Vietnamese women in the Red River delta were taken to China by Chinese recruitment agencies as well as Vietnamese women who were kidnapped from villages which were raided by Vietnamese and Chinese pirates. The Vietnamese women became wives, prostitutes, or slaves. Vietnamese women were viewed in China as \\"inured to hardship, resigned to their fate, and in addition of very gentle character\\" so they were wanted as concubines and servants in China and the massive traffick of Tongkinese (North Vietnamese) women to China started in 1875. There was massive demand for Vietnamese women in China. Southern Chinese ports were the destination of the children and women who were kidnapped by Chinese pirates from the area around Haiphong in Vietnam. Children and pretty women were taken by the pirates in their raids on Vietnamese villages. A major center for human trafficking of the slaves was Hai Phong. The Vietnamese children and women were kidnapped and brought to China to become slaves by both Chinese and Vietnamese pirates. Mung, Meo, Thai, and Nung minority women in Tonkin's mountains were kidnapped by Vietnamese pirates and Chinese pirates to bring to China. The anti-French Can Vuong rebels were the source of the Vietnamese bandits while former Taiping rebels were the source of the Chinese rebels. These Vietnamese and Chinese pirates fought against the French colonial military and ambushed French troops, receiving help from regular Chinese soldiers to fight against the French. Chinese and Nung pirates fought against Meo. The T'ai hated the Viet Minh and fought against them in 1947. Nung were said to be fit for banditry and piracy. Brothels in Bangkok bought kidnapped Vietnamese women fleeing South Vietnam after the Vietnam war who were taken by pirates.  Sex ratio  Recent studies have shown a shift in Vietnam's sex ratio to match that of other countries in the region, where proportions are uneven and men outnumber women. In 2006, the sex ratio was found to be 110 men per 100 women throughout Vietnam, higher than the established normal sex ratio of 106 men per 100 women. Researchers have pointed to the preference for a small family size, which stems from Vietnam's two-child policy, preference for sons, and increase in ultrasound and abortion usage for the cause of the sex ratio shift. = Sex-selective abortions = In 1988, Vietnam introduced its \\"two-child policy.\\" This policy was introduced because of the population size of Vietnam. However, because of the policy, if a woman gave birth to a son first, the chances of her having a second child dropped dramatically even if she desired to have more children. If a woman gave birth to a daughter first, she was more than likely to have a second child even if she did not wish to have additional children. This is because families in most cases would rather have at least one boy. To ensure the sex of children in recent years, Vietnamese families have increasingly been using ultrasound technology and enhancing and developing the produced images. This often leads to the abortion of female offspring. As of late 20th century, economist Amartya Sen has noted the recent advent of sex-selective abortions to further increase the phenomenon of \\"missing women\\" worldwide. This notion alludes to the worsening of the women-to-men ratio, with men continuing to outnumber women. = Female mortality = Since 1970, overall child mortality rates have declined. However, contrary to nearby countries such as India and China, male child mortality rates have shown to be higher than female child mortality rates most years from 1970 to 2000. In a study done by Pham et al., boys are 30% more likely than girls to die before a specified age. Tam ƒê∆∞·ªùng Education Overall literacy rates across Vietnam are high, with access to education being relatively equal between males and females. However, regional differences are still apparent, especially amongst the mountainous northern regions. For example, in one study, the region of Lai Chau was found to have a literacy rate for men double that of the women's literacy rate in the region. There is a gender gap in education, with males being more likely to attend school and sustain their education than females.Project of Children Statistics, 1989. Profiles of Children and Women zn Vietnam (Nhung van de ve tre em va phu nu Viet Nam) (Hanoi: General Statistical Office, 1989). Women and men tend to be segregated into different jobs, with more women serving in educational, communications, and public services than men.  Economy  In contemporary Vietnam, there has been significant economic advancement for women, especially for middle-class Vietnamese women. Middle-class women have increasingly become more involved in the workforce sector outside of the house, with 83% of \\"working-age women\\" being involved in the labor force. These women have been taking on professions dealing with a variety of fields such as sales, marketing, and advertising. Furthermore, women in the contemporary workforce and economy experience much higher wages than the generations before them. However, research has shown that many inequalities for women still exist, with women still receiving uneven employment benefits compared to their male counterparts. According to one study, 76% of women in the labor force are concentrated in the agricultural sector. And although under 10% of women in the labor force work in textile industry, 80% of laborers in the textile industry are women. Local credit associations do not feel secure giving loans to single mothers, which has resulted in a poverty increase for households that are led by a woman.T. V. A. Tran, \\"The Direct Loan of Capital from the Bank to Development Production and Gender Equality,\\" Social Sciences (Vietnam), vol. 34 (1992), pp. 25-26. = Gender pay gap = The average wage in the country of Vietnam was US$1,540 in 2012. In 2011, studies showed \\"that women earn 13% less than men.\\" The 2012 survey on workers‚Äô salaries carried out by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) in enterprises nationwide revealed that female workers‚Äô salaries are only 70-80% of their male colleagues‚Äô. The global average gender pay gap is hovering around seventeen percent According to Nguyen Kim Lan, ILO national project coordinator, the only 2 occupational fields where pay is equal is in logistics, and household care. One reason for the disparity is that companies view women as wanting to stay at home and perform more gender role duties. More than seventy percent of laborers in Vietnam are women. The International Labour Organizations recently stated that the gender pay gap has started to increase, according to the ILO Global Wage Report during the 2012-13 period, compared to 1999‚Äì2007. A two percent increase in the gap was recorded in Vietnam in the period.  Politics  Women's participation in the National Assembly is at its lowest since 1997. Little progress has been made to move ahead of the 30% average of women's representation in Vietnam. Within the Vietnam Communist Party, women's membership has slowly climbed, and in 2010 was 33%. This is a significant increase from 2005 when women's membership was only 21.9%. Despite this increase, the membership of women in the party is still less than men. Additionally, the number of women leaders in key positions such as in the Politburo, Central Committee and the Secretariat remains low. On the regional level, women occupy 23% of district positions, as well as 23% of municipal positions. Like the United Nation Millennium Development Goals, the Vietnamese government has also developed their own set of goals committed to increasing the percent of women in government, which in 2011 was still at 30%. One example of Vietnam's efforts to improve women representation are in the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women, which set goals to be reached by 2010. However, Vietnam has fallen short of many of its stated goals. There are several reasons that the government has not been able to meet its quota to have more women in government. The reasons include factors such as \\"inadequate government regulations, lack of implementation of existing policies, cultural factors, and inherent systemic bias towards men.\\" Many women that want to engage in politics are often discouraged because of age-related training eligibility criteria and a retirement age that is five years earlier than males, with males having a retirement age of 60 and women having a retirement age of 55. Workplace attitudes are challenges for women to achieve their aspiration of leadership positions. Unlike males, women are harassed much more in their occupations, and promotion is dependent upon the supervisors discretion and how he feels about gender promotion. There are few women role models for young women to follow or to be inspired by. Many women in Vietnam do not see themselves as becoming leaders because there a lack of female leaders to look up to. This occurs because of messages that are expressed socially in media, home, and education. Currently, the position of the Vice President of Vietnam is held by ƒê·∫∑ng Th·ªã Ng·ªçc Th·ªãnh, with this being the highest office to be held by a woman in Vietnam. However, most data has pointed to a majority of positions in recent office terms being held by men. For example, during the 2002 to 2007 term, all of the minister positions comprising the government cabinet were held by men. These statistics have constituted many leaders advocating for greater representation for women in leader positions. To implement this goal, a National Strategy on Gender Equality was recently implemented in 2011 through to 2020.  Human trafficking  Since the 1980s, some women from Vietnam have become victims of kidnapping, the bride-buying trade, and human trafficking and prostitution in China., Taiwan, South Korea, and in the cases of human trafficking, prostitution and sexual slavery, Cambodia. The present- day struggle of the Vietnamese female victims of \\"bride-brokers\\" can be summarized by the larger-than-life poem known as \\"The Tale of Kieu,\\" which narrates the story of a female protagonist of Vietnam who was purchased by foreigners and was violated, yet kept fighting back against her captors and offenders. Women and girls from all ethnic groups and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Vietnam. The main human rights issue in Southeast Asia is Human trafficking. According to one study, Southeast Asia is a large source of human trafficking, with many individuals who fall victim to human trafficking being sent to Australia. Vietnam, as well as other countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and the Philippines, are major source countries for human trafficking. Southeast Asian countries preference for boys over girls is further tipping the balance between the sexes in the region, already skewed by a strong bias for boys. The trend has led to increased trafficking of women. While many of the victims that are a part of human trafficking are forced/kidnapped/enslaved, others were lured in under the assumption that they were getting a better job. According to a policy brief on human trafficking in Southeast Asia, although victims include girls, women, boys, and men, the majority are women. Women tend to be more highly targeted by traffickers due to the fact that they are seeking opportunity in an area of the world where limited economic opportunities are available for them. Unskilled and poorly educated women are commonly led into human trafficking. According to the UNODC report, the numbers for women and men in forced labor may be skewed due to the fact that only a few countries released the numbers for adult men. However what is known is that women are trafficked the most. The main causes of human trafficking in Southeast Asia are universal factors such as poverty and globalization. Industrialization is arguably also another factor of human trafficking. Many scholars argue that industrialization of booming economies, like that of Thailand and Singapore, created a draw for poor migrants seeking upward mobility and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries. These migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the cheap labor from within its borders. A high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking cheap labor creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive. The sex industry emerged in Southeast Asia in the mid 20th century as a way for women to generate more income for struggling migrants and locals trying to support families or themselves. Sex industries first catered to military personnel on leave from bases but as military installations began to recede the industry turned its attention to growing tourism. Even as the industry is looked down upon today there is still a large underground market that is demanding from traffickers. Between 2005 and 2009, 6,000 women, as well as younger girls, were found to be in the human trafficking statistic. The majority of the women and girls are trafficked to China, 30% are trafficked to Cambodia, and the remaining 10% are trafficked to the destinations across the world.The trafficking of women and children from Vietnam. Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in association with the British Embassy, Hanoi. (2011) Vietnam Women's Union Disaster Preparedness workshop in Can Thao district, southern Vietnam In recent decades, Vietnam has stressed the importance of gender equality. To address this goal, the Vietnam Women's Union, an organization founded in 1930 under the Vietnam Communist Party, has pursued the advancement of women in many arenas; however, they also stress many aspects of Confucian doctrine that keeps a male-dominated hierarchy in place. As of 2000, their membership has expanded to 11 million, which compromises for 60% of the female population in Vietnam over the age of 18. Because of their large membership, the Vietnam Women's Union has frequently been regarded as the representative for women in politics. Therefore, the VWU frequently advises during the policy-making of gender-related or women's issues. However, their role has been disputed due to its shortcomings in promoting women's right effectively. In the 1980s, the Vietnam Women's Union increased paid maternity leave and received a promise that they would be asked before the government implemented any policies that could potentially affect the welfare of women. However, the increased maternity leave was restored to its original length a few years later. While there are limits in the Vietnam Women's Union that prohibit gender change in certain areas, there does not seem to be other organized civil society groups that are fighting for women's rights. Two areas that have seen little change throughout recent decades are the roles women play in the family, specifically motherhood, and the human rights problems women traditionally face in the region. In 2001, the Vietnam Women's Union was appointed to head the planning of a new legislation, a Law on Gender Equality, which set out to equalize conditions between both genders.

Railway company employees were widely dispersed with some maintaining track in relatively remote locations, while others moved from place to place with train crews. A railway pay car was typically attached to a train traveling over the line at fixed intervals to disburse wages to employees, who would assemble at every station and designated intermediate stopping points to be paid. The pay car was usually a converted passenger car fitted out with two doors allowing formation of a queue through the identification and disbursing procedure. The pay car also contained sleeping and eating facilities for the paymaster, armed guards, clerks maintaining pay records, and a cook. History Railways brought industrialized jobs to remote locations without banking facilities. Efficiency was increased by avoiding wasted man-hours assembling employees at a central pay location. The trains offered greater security than alternative methods of bringing payroll cash to remote locations. The pay car might be run as a separate extra train or included in a regularly scheduled train, with appropriate routing and scheduling to accommodate the numerous stops. Pay cars were discontinued in favor of wage paychecks when local banks became available and automobile ownership increased among employees. Canadian Pacific Railway operated the last pay car in the United States or Canada weekly over the International Railway of Maine until 6 July 1960. Mexican railways used pay cars for a few more decades. See also * Money train, one or more railcars to collect fare collection revenue from stations and return it to a central location.

Women in Macau, as described by Candice Chio Ngan Ieng, president of the Macau Women's General Association (AGMM), in 2010 are currently defining themselves as capable and irreplaceable powers to Macau's modern-day civilization.  Domestic Life = Education  According to a fact sheet produced by Mariette Bolina, child rearing is often considered the role of women, but later, more women will decide to pursue an education. The improvement of the level of education received by women in Macau is often attributed to the overall improvement of quality of Macau's education system and the overall improvement of women's educational awareness. from 1970 to 2007, due to the changing status of women in Macau's society and more people pursuing a greater level of education, the number of female university students increased from 10.8 million to 77.4 million. However, there still exists illiteracy among Macanese women. It is theorised that by discarding Traditionalist attitudes and encouraging more women to pursue an education, Macau could eliminate this illiteracy. In addition, the gender gap between Macanese men and women can be eliminated through the pursuit of education.  Career  In the early 1990s, women in Macau became an indispensable force in the labor market. The 1991 edition of the Employment Survey, using data from Macau's Statistic and Census Bureau, estimated that the labor participation rate of women was 44.35%, the rate would later increase to 45.32% in 1996.Êæ≥Èó®ÁªüËÆ°Êö®ÊôÆÊü•Â±Ä(Macau Statistics and Census Bureau) : „Ää Á¨¨ÂçÅ‰∏âÊ¨°‰∫∫Âè£ÊôÆÊü•Á¨¨‰∏â‰ΩèÂ±ãË∞ÉÊü•„Äã, 1991 Âπ¥ „ÄÇ „Ää96‰∏≠Êúü‰∫∫Âè£ÊôÆÊü•„Äã , 1996 Âπ¥ „ÄÇ The income level of employed women has increased since the 1990s, reducing the income gap between men and women.

This suggests that Traditionalist attitudes are still somewhat persistent in Macanese society but is waning in more familial settings and younger generations.  Family Life  According to a survey from the Macau women's database, The respondents are mostly dissatisfied in communication with their families, also the living environment, and getting alone with husband plus children's education. Their life experiences is also vary on age. From age 18-30, communication with families and economic situation are mostly dissatisfied by the respondents. For age 31-55, children education and also the economic status are the things respondents worried about, after age 56, respondents are more concern about the communication with families. In general, the happiness of family life in Macau women will change according to different ages, income status and marital status.  Political Participation  While under the colonial Portuguese, the affairs of Macau were all managed by Portuguese politicians. Chinese inhabitants rarely had adequate representation in local politics. The opportunity for women to participate in political affairs were even moreso. After the period of colonization,The Special Administrative Region's Government enacted legislation to eliminate discrimination against women. In addition, various bureaus and departments have been founded to help advance and protect the equality of women and their welfare. This is explemified by Article 38 of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China which states: > \\"Women's rights and interests are protected by the Macao Special > Administrative Region.\\"  Florinda Chan  Florinda Chan became a noteworthy Feminist icon in Macau after she became the Chief of Administrator of Macau at age 45.„Ää‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊó•Êä•„ÄãÔºàÊµ∑Â§ñÁâàÔºâ2001Âπ¥12Êúà20Êó•Á¨¨‰∏âÁâà Sex trafficking Sex trafficking in Macau remains a commonplace practice and contentious concern.

Computer-generated imagery (CGI) is the application of computer graphics to create or contribute to images in art, printed media, video games, films, television programs, shorts, commercials, videos, and simulators. The images may be dynamic or static, and may be two-dimensional (2D), although the term \\"CGI\\" is most commonly used to refer to the 3-D computer graphics used for creating characters, scenes and special effects in films and television, which is described as 'CGI animation'. The evolution of CGI led to the emergence of virtual cinematography in the 1990s where the vision of the simulated camera is not constrained by the laws of physics. Availability of CGI software and increased computer speeds have allowed individual artists and small companies to produce professional-grade films, games, and fine art from their home computers. The term virtual world refers to agent-based, interactive environments, which are now created with CGI. Static images and landscapes Fractal landscape Not only do animated images form part of computer-generated imagery, natural looking landscapes (such as fractal landscapes) are also generated via computer algorithms. A simple way to generate fractal surfaces is to use an extension of the triangular mesh method, relying on the construction of some special case of a de Rham curve, e.g. midpoint displacement. For instance, the algorithm may start with a large triangle, then recursively zoom in by dividing it into four smaller Sierpinski triangles, then interpolate the height of each point from its nearest neighbors. The creation of a Brownian surface may be achieved not only by adding noise as new nodes are created but by adding additional noise at multiple levels of the mesh. Thus a topographical map with varying levels of height can be created using relatively straightforward fractal algorithms. Some typical, easy-to-program fractals used in CGI are the plasma fractal and the more dramatic fault fractal.Game programming gems 2 by Mark A. DeLoura 2001 page 240 Many specific techniques been researched and developed to produce highly focused computer-generated effects ‚Äî e.g., the use of specific models to represent the chemical weathering of stones to model erosion and produce an \\"aged appearance\\" for a given stone-based surface.Digital modeling of material appearance by Julie Dorsey, Holly Rushmeier, Fran√ßois X. Sillion 2007 page 217 Architectural scenes Blender Modern architects use services from computer graphic firms to create 3-dimensional models for both customers and builders. These computer generated models can be more accurate than traditional drawings. Architectural animation (which provides animated movies of buildings, rather than interactive images) can also be used to see the possible relationship a building will have in relation to the environment and its surrounding buildings. The rendering of architectural spaces without the use of paper and pencil tools is now a widely accepted practice with a number of computer-assisted architectural design systems. Architectural modeling tools allow an architect to visualize a space and perform \\"walk- throughs\\" in an interactive manner, thus providing \\"interactive environments\\" both at the urban and building levels.Interactive environments with open- source software: 3D walkthroughs by Wolfgang H√∂hl, Wolfgang H√∂hl 2008 pages 24-29 Specific applications in architecture not only include the specification of building structures (such as walls and windows) and walk-throughs but the effects of light and how sunlight will affect a specific design at different times of the day.Advances in Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering by Tarek Sobh 2008 pages 136-139 Architectural modeling tools have now become increasingly internet-based. However, the quality of internet-based systems still lags behind that of sophisticated in-house modeling systems.Encyclopedia of Multimedia Technology and Networking, Volume 1 by Margherita Pagani 2005 page 1027 In some applications, computer-generated images are used to \\"reverse engineer\\" historical buildings. For instance, a computer-generated reconstruction of the monastery at Georgenthal in Germany was derived from the ruins of the monastery, yet provides the viewer with a \\"look and feel\\" of what the building would have looked like in its day.Interac storytelling: First Joint International Conference by Ulrike Spierling, Nicolas Szilas 2008 pages 114-118 Anatomical models A CT pulmonary angiogram image generated by a computer from a collection of x-rays Computer generated models used in skeletal animation are not always anatomically correct. However, organizations such as the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute have developed anatomically correct computer-based models. Computer generated anatomical models can be used both for instructional and operational purposes. To date, a large body of artist produced medical images continue to be used by medical students, such as images by Frank H. Netter, e.g. Cardiac images. However, a number of online anatomical models are becoming available. A single patient X-ray is not a computer generated image, even if digitized. However, in applications which involve CT scans a three-dimensional model is automatically produced from many single-slice x-rays, producing \\"computer generated image\\". Applications involving magnetic resonance imaging also bring together a number of \\"snapshots\\" (in this case via magnetic pulses) to produce a composite, internal image. In modern medical applications, patient-specific models are constructed in 'computer assisted surgery'. For instance, in total knee replacement, the construction of a detailed patient-specific model can be used to carefully plan the surgery.Total Knee Arthroplasty by Johan Bellemans, Michael D. Ries, Jan M.K. Victor 2005 pages 241-245 These three-dimensional models are usually extracted from multiple CT scans of the appropriate parts of the patient's own anatomy. Such models can also be used for planning aortic valve implantations, one of the common procedures for treating heart disease. Given that the shape, diameter, and position of the coronary openings can vary greatly from patient to patient, the extraction (from CT scans) of a model that closely resembles a patient's valve anatomy can be highly beneficial in planning the procedure.I. Waechter et al. Patient Specific Models for Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve Implantation in Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention -- MICCAI 2010 edited by Tianzi Jiang, 2010 pages 526-560 Cloth and skin images Computer-generated wet fur Models of cloth generally fall into three groups: *The geometric-mechanical structure at yarn crossing *The mechanics of continuous elastic sheets *The geometric macroscopic features of cloth.Cloth modeling and animation by Donald House, David E. Breen 2000 page 20 To date, making the clothing of a digital character automatically fold in a natural way remains a challenge for many animators.Film and photography by Ian Graham 2003 page 21 In addition to their use in film, advertising and other modes of public display, computer generated images of clothing are now routinely used by top fashion design firms.Designing clothes: culture and organization of the fashion industry by Veronica Manlow 2007 page 213 The challenge in rendering human skin images involves three levels of realism: *Photo realism in resembling real skin at the static level *Physical realism in resembling its movements *Function realism in resembling its response to actions.Handbook of Virtual Humans by Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann and Daniel Thalmann, 2004 pages 353-370 The finest visible features such as fine wrinkles and skin pores are the size of about 100 ¬µm or 0.1 millimetres. Skin can be modeled as a 7-dimensional bidirectional texture function (BTF) or a collection of bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) over the target's surfaces. Interactive simulation and visualization Interactive visualization is the rendering of data that may vary dynamically and allowing a user to view the data from multiple perspectives. The applications areas may vary significantly, ranging from the visualization of the flow patterns in fluid dynamics to specific computer aided design applications.Mathematical optimization in computer graphics and vision by Luiz Velho, Paulo Cezar Pinto Carvalho 2008 page 177 The data rendered may correspond to specific visual scenes that change as the user interacts with the system ‚Äî e.g. simulators, such as flight simulators, make extensive use of CGI techniques for representing the world.GPU-based interactive visualization techniques by Daniel Weiskopf 2006 pages 1-8 At the abstract level, an interactive visualization process involves a \\"data pipeline\\" in which the raw data is managed and filtered to a form that makes it suitable for rendering. This is often called the \\"visualization data\\". The visualization data is then mapped to a \\"visualization representation\\" that can be fed to a rendering system. This is usually called a \\"renderable representation\\". This representation is then rendered as a displayable image. As the user interacts with the system (e.g. by using joystick controls to change their position within the virtual world) the raw data is fed through the pipeline to create a new rendered image, often making real-time computational efficiency a key consideration in such applications.Trends in interactive visualization by Elena van Zudilova- Seinstra, Tony Adriaansen, Robert Liere 2008 pages 1-7 Computer animation Machinima films are, by nature, CGI films While computer-generated images of landscapes may be static, computer animation only applies to dynamic images that resemble a movie. However, in general, the term computer animation refers to dynamic images that do not allow user interaction, and the term virtual world is used for the interactive animated environments. Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the art of stop motion animation of 3D models and frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. Computer generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes, such as constructing miniatures for effects shots or hiring extras for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology. It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors, expensive set pieces, or props. To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer screen and repeatedly replaced by a new image which is similar to the previous image, but advanced slightly in the time domain (usually at a rate of 24 or 30 frames/second). This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion pictures. Virtual worlds A yellow submarine in Second Life Metallic balls A virtual world is a simulated environment, which allows the user to interact with animated characters, or interact with other users through the use of animated characters known as avatars. Virtual worlds are intended for its users to inhabit and interact, and the term today has become largely synonymous with interactive 3D virtual environments, where the users take the form of avatars visible to others graphically.Cook, A.D. (2009). A case study of the manifestations and significance of social presence in a multi-user virtual environment. MEd Thesis. Available online These avatars are usually depicted as textual, two- dimensional, or three-dimensional graphical representations, although other forms are possible (auditory and touch sensations for example). Some, but not all, virtual worlds allow for multiple users. In courtrooms Computer- generated imagery has been used in courtrooms, primarily since the early 2000s. However, some experts have argued that it is prejudicial. They are used to help judges or the jury to better visualize the sequence of events, evidence or hypothesis.Computer-generated images influence trial results The Conversation, 31 October 2013 However, a 1997 study showed that people are poor intuitive physicists and easily influenced by computer generated images. Thus it is important that jurors and other legal decision-makers be made aware that such exhibits are merely a representation of one potential sequence of events.  Motion capture  Computer-generated imagery is often used in conjunction with motion capture to better cover the faults that come with CGI and animation. Computer-generated imagery is limited in its practical application by how realistic it can look. Unrealistic, or badly managed computer-generated imagery can result in the Uncanny Valley effect. This effect refers to the human ability to recognize things that look eerily like humans, but are slightly off. Such ability is a fault with normal computer- generated imagery which, due to the complex anatomy of the human body, can often fail to replicate it perfectly. This is where motion capture comes into play. Artists can use a motion capture rig to get footage of a human performing an action and then replicate it perfectly with computer-generated imagery so that it looks normal. The lack of anatomically correct digital models contributes to the necessity of motion capture as it is used with computer-generated imagery. Because computer-generated imagery reflects only the outside, or skin, of the object being rendered, it fails to capture the infinitesimally small interactions between interlocking muscle groups used in fine motor control, like speaking. The constant motion of the face as it makes sounds with shaped lips and tongue movement, along with the facial expressions that go along with speaking are difficult to replicate by hand. Motion capture can catch the underlying movement of facial muscles and better replicate the visual that goes along with the audio, like Josh Brolin's Thanos.

When he was younger, he and his partner Barry Keith-Trimble (Roland Young) were preparing for the opening night of O'Farell's play Laughter by getting drunk. When it was time to perform, they were so intoxicated they ended up brawling on stage and fell into the orchestra pit. The two left the theater and continued drinking, until they learn that they have been suspended. At the same time, O'Farrell learns that his wife, actress Alyce Martelle, is pregnant and has left him for ruining her performance in Laughter as Toni. Despondent, he in left the business and went into seclusion. Years later, his daughter Marie (Olympe Bradna) locates him and inspires him to return to Broadway. He decides to restage Laughter with its original cast, but with Marie substituting for Alyce in the part of Toni.

The museum shares the stories of the history, cultures, values, and traditions of Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and all Latinos in Los Angeles and Southern California. The museum programs include exhibitions, educational programs, and public programming. The museum is near Olvera Street in the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic District, also called El Pueblo. It is next to La Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de los Angeles, also called La Placita or Plaza Church. The buildings are from the 1880s, some of the oldest in the city, the Vickrey- Brunswig Building and the Plaza House (1883). It is owned by Los Angeles County which also owns Los Angeles County Museum of Art and others. For a time after its founding, LA Plaza struggled with financial problems; Donations and grants were expected to surpass $3.5 million in 2017. A walkway is used to display large outdoors sculptures.

Part of the cost was funded by Molina's county discretionary spending funds. The center is on , with a price tag of $54 million and an operating budget of $850,000. It was designed by Chu+Gooding Architects. The rehabilitation of the shell and core of the historic Plaza House and Vickrey-Brunswig Building was completed in December 2009.

Referring to an Environmental Impact Report conducted by Sapphos Environmental, Gloria Molina said \\"Had they done better work, we wouldn't be in this situation.\\" Remains were taken to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Operation A $135-million development of 341 apartments with shops and community facilities near the cultural center provides funding for nonprofit foundation that runs LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes. The project was approved in 2014 along with a deal with the county Board of Supervisors to lease the parcel to the foundation for a dollar who then sublets it to the developer. The site had two public parking lots so the county no longer gets that income but does get property tax revenues from the development. The project includes a pedestrian oriented arcade facing Spring Street that incorporates prominent access to the LA Plaza Paseo, which connects the parcels to LA Plaza and Union Station. The layout facilitates pedestrian access to Fort Moore and Grand Park on Hill Street.

Code Commission The CLRC is the successor to the California Code Commission, which itself was the successor to a series of earlier ad hoc codification commissions. The Code Commission was established in 1929. It spent 24 years codifying the massive body of uncodified law that had accumulated (and continued to accumulate) in the California Statutes, because the original California Codes were not a comprehensive codification. After the Code Commission completed the monumental task of codifying virtually all general California statutory law into the California Codes, it recommended the creation of the CLRC, as a permanent law reform body.

Early life and family Lockhart was born in Virginia in 1782. At age 32, Byrd Lockhart was known to be a surveyor in Madison County, Illinois. He moved to Texas from Missouri with his mother, sister, and two children. He was already a widower when he settled in Green DeWitt's colony on March 20, 1826.Groneman, Alamo Defenders, p. 72. Career in Texas Lockhart was appointed deputy surveyor to James Kerr on December 12, 1826, and surveyed the lands of DeWitt Colony around Gonzales.Gonzales County Surveyors 1825 to Present In January, he headed a meeting denouncing the Fredonian Rebellion and pledging loyalty to the Mexican government. In April he was put in charge of defense in Gonzales, utilizing a row of blockhouses that served as protection against Indians. Later in 1827 he pioneered construction of roads from Bexar to Gonzales and from the Lavaca River right bank to the Matagorda Bay. In 1830 he was paid four leagues of land on Plum Creek for his construction work. In April 1831 he was appointed official surveyor to DeWitt's colony by Jos√© Antonio Navarro. It was during this time that he and Land Commissioner Navarro laid out the official plans for the town of Gonzales.http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/gonzalesdeeds.htm Byrd Lockhart became the municipal surveyor of District three in September.Groneman, Alamo Defenders, pp. 72-73. Texas Revolution In late 1835, he joined with Commander Stephen F. Austin's forces in San Antonio and served with James W. Fannin as a scout. Private Lockhart recruited his son, Byrd Lockhart, Jr. and they participated in the siege of Bexar in Captain John York's company. On the following 17 January, Colonel James C. Neill, Jos√© Francisco Ruiz, and John William Smith, together with Lockhart were selected as commissioners by James W. Robinson to parley with the hostile Comanche Indians, endangering Bexar.Groneman, Alamo Defenders, p. 73. Lockhart was named along with Mathew Caldwell and William A. Mathews commissioners to raise a group of volunteers in Gonzales for a ranging company on February 4.Lindley (2003), p. 96. Though serving at Bexar, he and Andrew Jackson Sowell were sent from the Alamo a short time before the battle to obtain supplies for the garrison. They were delayed foraging livestock and supplies and were blocked by Mexican troops upon their return.Lindley (2003), p. 90. They promptly headed for Gonzales and on February 23, the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers were mustered into service by Lockhart. He, Sowell and others would ride back with the 32 Rangers, into the Alamo, on the morning of March 1 and later depart again, at night, as other couriers left.Lindley (2003), p. 98. Lockhart later served the Texan army as the captain of a spy company. He died in 1839.Groneman, Alamo Defenders, p. 74. Legacy The town of Lockhart, Texas is named in his honor.

Distribution and habitat N. anomala is found from the Canary Isles, Ireland, Scotland, the Faeroe Isles, Norway, Iceland and Svalbard. It is found attached to the bedrock and boulders at a depth of up to 1500 metres in sheltered environments where the water movement is low.Marine Life Information Network Description In appearance, N. anomala resembles a cockle or limpet with a low conical, oval shell up to fifteen millimetres long. The upper valve is the only part visible as the lower valve is cemented to the rock beneath. The shell surface is smooth, white, buff or pale grey and has fine concentric lines. The outer surface is covered by a thin brown periostracum. Biology N. anomala is a filter feeder, using the lophophore between the two valves to selectively catch particles that drift past. It lives for up to ten years but growth is slow after the first year. It is free- spawning with external fertilisation in the water. The eggs sink to the bottom and hatch into free-swimming juveniles. These larvae are fully developed within three days and settle out a few days later, attaching themselves to the substrate. Because N. anomala favours waters with tidal flows of less than one knot, dispersal may be limited. Ecology N. anomala is often the dominant species in its environment. It is eaten by starfish, crustacea, gastropods and fish. Compared to molluscs, the shell is easily drilled into and the shells are often heavily bored. However predation seems to be limited, perhaps because the brachiopod is unpalatable. This species is often found in association with the sea anemone Protanthea simplex in very sheltered deep water, usually on littoral bedrock, silty boulders and rock slopes in fiords and other areas with calm waters. They are often accompanied by the parchment worm Chaetopterus variopedatus, encrusting red algae and the polychaete worm Pomatoceros triqueter. Other members of the community may be the saddle oyster Pododesmus patelliformis and the fan worm Sabella pavonina. Scattered colonies of Alcyonium digitatum are occasionally present along with the hydroid Bougainvillia muscus. The barnacle Balanus balanus and the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus can often be seen in the vicinity and the squat lobster Munida rugosa may be hiding in crevices nearby.European Environment Agency A range of solitary sea squirts are often present including Ciona intestinalis, Corella parallelogramma, Polycarpa pomaria, Ascidia mentula and Ascidia virginea. Echinoderms such as the brittle star Ophiothrix fragilis are frequently seen with their arms protruding from rock cracks, whilst the starfish Asterias rubens and the sea urchins Echinus esculentus and Psammechinus miliaris occasionally form part of the community, as does the whelk Buccinum undatum. A survey was undertaken of the marine ecology in deep water off County Kerry in Ireland, The rock and boulders were covered with a fine silt and there were coralline crusts over most surfaces. N. anomala was found on the steep sides and lower parts of boulders while the tube worm Pomatoceros triqueter and the stony coral Caryophyllia smithii predominated on the upper parts.BioMar survey of the Kenmare River area, Co.

History  The episcopal see of the Bishop was Roskilde Cathedral but from 1167, when Bishop Absalon completed a new bishop's palace known as Absalon's Castle on the small island of Slotsholmen, he resided at the small town of Havn, which later became the present Danish capital Copenhagen. The diocese originally included both the island of Zealand and Scania (southern Sweden, then part of Denmark), but Scania was disjoined in 1060 and initially divided into the short-lived Diocese of Dalby and the Diocese of Lund, which absorbed the first and became the Metropolitan of (southern) Scandinavia. The diocese was dissolved with the Reformation of Denmark and replaced by the Protestant Diocese of Zealand in 1537.  Successor jurisdictions  In 1868, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen was established with St. Ansgar's Cathedral as the seat.

Siderophores, compounds of low molecular mass with high affinities for ferric iron, are important virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. Iron‚Äîan essential element for life used for such cellular processes as respiration and DNA replication‚Äîis extensively chelated by host proteins like lactoferrin and ferritin; thus, the pathogen produces molecules with an even higher affinity for Fe3+ than these proteins in order to acquire sufficient iron for growth. As a part of such an iron- uptake system, yersiniabactin plays an important role in pathogenicity of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. entercolitica. Structure and coordination properties Yersiniabactin is a four ring structure composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. According to X-ray crystallography, it binds Fe3+as a 1:1 complex by three nitrogen electron pairs and three negatively charged oxygen atoms with a distorted octahedral structure. The Ybt-Fe3+ complex has a proton-independent formation constant of 4 x 1036. Biosynthesis Ybt synthesis occurs by a mixed nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) mechanism. Several enzymes, most notably the HMWP2-HMWP1complex, assemble salicylate, three cysteines, a malonyl linker group and three methyl groups into a four-ring structure made of salicylate, one thiazolidine, and two thiazoline rings with a malonyl linker between the thiazoline and the thiazolidine. YbtD, a phosphopantetheinyl transferase, adds phosphopantetheine tethers to the cysteine, salicylate and malonyl groups to HMWP1 and HMWP2. YbtS synthesizes salicylate from chorismate, which is then adenylated by YbtE and transferred to the HMWP2‚ÄìHMWP1 assembly complex. HMWP2, which consists of two multidomain NRPS modules, accepts the activated salicylate unit through a carrier protein, then cyclizes and condenses two cysteines to form two thiazoline rings. A malonyl linker is added by the PKS portion of HMWP1, and YbtU reduces the second thiazoline ring to thiazolidine before cyclization and condensation of the final thiazoline ring on HMWP1‚Äôs NRPs domain. YbtT thioesterase may serve some editing function to remove abnormal molecules from the enzyme complex, and a thioesterase domain of HMWP1 releases the completed siderophore from the enzyme complex. Regulation of expression The HPI upon which the genes encoding the Ybt biosynthesis proteins are located is controlled by a series of molecular regulators. All four promoter regions of the yersiniabactin region (psn, irp2, ybtA and ybtP) possess a Fur-binding site and are negatively regulated by this repressor in the presence of iron. In the presence of Ybt, a member of the AraC family of transcriptional regulators, activates expression from the psn, irp2 and ybtP (transport and biosynthetic genes) promoters but represses expression of its own promoter. There is also evidence that yersiniabactin itself may upregulate its own expression and that of psn/fyuA and ybtPQXS at the transcription level. Role in Yersinia pathogenicity As previously mentioned, siderophores serve the essential function of iron acquisition for pathogens in the low iron conditions of the host. Thus the successful establishment of disease depends on the ability of the invading organism to acquire iron. Because of its high affinity for iron, yersiniabactin can solubilize the metal bound to host binding proteins and transport it back to the bacteria. The complex yersiniabactin-Fe3+ recognizes the specific bacterial outer membrane TonB-dependent receptor, FyuA (Psn), and is translocated with the help of membrane-embedded proteins into the cytosol where the iron is discharged from yersiniabactin and used in various metabolic pathways. In the absence of a high-affinity iron-chelating compound, pathogenic Yersinia, responsible for such lethal disease as the bubonic plague, only causes local symptoms of moderate intensity. The availability of iron, through an intrinsic high-affinity iron-chelating system such as Ybt, provides the bacteria with the ability to multiply in the host and to cause systemic infections.

The fox's Sierra Nevada Distinct Population Segment is estimated at 29 adults near Sonora Pass in California. The Southern Cascades Distinct Population Segment consists of an estimated 42 adults near Lassen Volcanic National Park and an unknown number of individuals in five areas of Oregon. No other populations are known. Interbreeding with non-native red foxes and recruitment success are primary conservation concerns. The State of California banned trapping of Sierra Nevada red foxes in 1974 and listed the subspecies as threatened in 1980. The fox is a data gap species in Oregon and designated an Oregon sensitive species by the U.S. Forest Service. The Sierra Nevada Distinct Population Segment is listed as warranted but precluded under the Endangered Species Act. Listing of the Southern Cascades Distinct Population Segment was found to be not warranted. Description Like other montane foxes, Sierra Nevada red foxes are somewhat smaller and lighter in weight than lowland North American red foxes. Their pelage may be red, cross, or silver phase with the red phase having the greyish-blonde coloration characteristic of montane foxes. All three phases occur in the Oregon Cascade and Sonora Pass populations, but only red phase individuals have been found in the Lassen population. Pads are fur-covered, a common adaptation to travel over snow. Sierra Nevada red foxes are long-lived relative to other red foxes, five or six years perhaps being a typical lifespan. Non-invasively monitored females have either not bred or bred a minority of years. Red fox fur was sought after by trappers during the early part of the 20th century because it was softer than that of California‚Äôs gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Range Sierra Nevada red foxes are one of three fox subspecies in the montane clade of North America, occurring in the Cascade Mountains south of the Columbia River and California's Sierra Nevada range. Joseph Grinnell identified separated montane fox populations in the Oregon Cascades, Mount Shasta, Lassen Peak, and Sierra Nevada in 1937. Study then lapsed for approximately 60 to 75 years, depending on location. Rediscovery of the Lassen population began in 1993 followed by detection of a Sierra Nevada population at Sonora Pass in 2010 and rediscovery of the Oregon Cascades population began in 2011. The Lassen and Sonora Pass populations are isolated from each other and it is unknown if a population remains at Mount Shasta. The extent of the Sierra Nevada red fox populations is an area of active research. In Oregon, ongoing studies at Mount Hood and Central Oregon were prompted by observations in 2012 and 2013. Recent genetic evidence also suggests range expansion into western Oregon since the 1940s. In California, detections occurred in northern Yosemite National Park the winter of 2014-15, the Stanislaus National Forest in late 2015, and in Lassen Volcanic National Park in 2018. The first two areas are near Sonora Pass, but it has not been confirmed the individuals are part of the Sonora Pass population. Elevations occupied by the Sierra Nevada red fox are also an area of current research. Oregon detections have occurred between 4900 and 6500 feet, though observations of Cascade red fox in Washington suggest lower elevations may be accessed during dispersal. John Perrine's study on Lassen Peak, using 144 baited motion-sensitive cameras from 1997 to 2002, found no foxes below 4520 feet. Historically, Grinnell's 1937 survey found occurrence from 4500 to 11,500 feet in California. The fox was initially described in 1906 as occurring above 6000 feet in the high Sierra. Genetic studies beginning in 2010 have also shown the Sacramento Valley red fox (Vulpes vulpes patwin) is a distinct subspecies more closely related to the Sierra Nevada red fox than introduced, lowland red fox present in the rest of California. A relatively restricted and narrow hybrid zone between Sacramento Valley red and non-native foxes has been stable for several decades, despite five-fold expansion of non-native red fox populations throughout the rest of lowland and coastal California. This may be due to the foxes' monogamous mating system and highly specific mate selection. A similar boundary may exist between Sierra Nevada red foxes and both the Sacramento Valley red fox and the introduced lowland foxes. Sierra Nevada red fox makes first reappearance in Yosemite in nearly 100 years. Diet A 2005 study of the then remnant population surviving on Mount Lassen found that the foxes are nocturnal hunters whose diet is predominantly mammals, especially rodents and mule deer, supplemented by birds, insects and pinemat manzanita berries as seasonally available. Lagomorphs (hares, rabbits and pikas) were virtually absent from the foxes' diet. History The three subspecies in the montane clade separated after the Wisconsin glaciation, 15 to 20,000 years ago, with the Columbia River perhaps dividing the Cascade and Sierra Nevada red foxes. However, prior to 2010, montane red foxes in Oregon were presumed to be the Cascade red fox. Earlier literature therefore indicates incorrect ranges for the Cascade and Sierra Nevada red fox. Documented trapping of the Sierra Nevada red fox may have begun when Moses Schallenberger of the Stephens- Townsend-Murphy Party spent the winter of 1844-45 at Donner Pass, taking an average of one red fox every two days.

The area is part of the historical region of Lower Carniola. The municipality is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Mokronog-Trebelno municipal website Name Mokronog was first attested in written sources in 1137 under the German name Nazu≈èz (and as Nazzenfuz in 1143 and Nazzenvozzen in 1158). The Slovene name Mokronag was not attested until 1689.\\"Mokronog.\\" Edinost 32.6 (6 Jan. 1907), p. 5.

The name was originally a genitive plural (nominative *Mokronozi, accusative *Mokronoge; cf. the related place names Mokronoge and Mokronoge, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina) that was reinterpreted as a singular. It is believed to be a compound of the adjective moker 'wet' + the noun noga 'foot of a hill/mountain', thus originally meaning 'wet area at the foot of a mountain'. The hypothesis that the name means 'wet foot' as a humorous reference to people living in a wet place is less likely. Also less likely is the hypothesis that it is derived from *Makrom—ånovo (< *ma- 'somehow' + *krom—ån—ä 'hidden'). In the past the German name was Nassenfu√ü. Churches The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Giles () and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Mesto. It was built in the style of the late-Baroque Neoclassicism from 1822 to 1824 on the site of an older church that collapsed. The church tower was redesigned in 1940 based on plans by the architect Janez Valentinƒçiƒç, a student of Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. A second church in the northern part of the settlement (≈†eginke) is dedicated to Saint Florian. It dates to the mid-17th century. A third church stands to the west on Mount Sorrow (, , 366 m). It is dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows and dates from 1697, with 18th- and 19th-century painting. History Mokronog was first mentioned in 1137, and acquired market rights in 1279. Around 1340, a wall was built around the town, of which only a tower now remains. The town suffered severely from Ottoman raids in the 16th and 17th century and it lost most of its population. It regained some of its former importance only in early 19th century, when it became a center of the leather industry. The leather factory was completely destroyed in 1943 by a Nazi air strike.

Guest stars include Condoleezza Rice, Margaret Cho, Elizabeth Banks, Adriane Lenox, and Thomas Roberts. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is shocked to discover that his wife, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) has been detained in North Korea by Kim Jong-il (Margaret Cho) to be used in propaganda. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) rearranges her personal life and comes upon an obstacle. And Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) settles back into TGS With Tracy Jordan only to discover that his entourage members, Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown), have bonded with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in his absence. KUAM aired the episode on Sunday, May 1, 2011 due to The Royal Wedding, which aired the next morning on most NBC Stations, preempting the episode. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is clearing out her apartment following her discovery that Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) had been living there. She comes to the conclusion that she needs to take control of her personal life. However, her hopes are dashed when a plastic bag blows into a tree opposite her apartment and refuses to be moved. Following a disastrous visit to City Hall, Liz attempts to take matters into her own hands and attacks the tree, before being apprehended by a police officer with a taser. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is shocked to learn that his wife Avery Jessup has been kidnapped by Kim Jong-il whilst in North Korea, and forced to take part in Anti-American propaganda. Jack turns to his ex-girlfriend, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, with whom he broke up via text message, for help. However, she is unable to assist and Avery is forced into marrying Kim Jong- un. Tracy returns to work at TGS but is shocked to discover his entourage members, Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown), referring with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to an amusing incident that happened during his absence. Tracy forces the trio to recreate the events that led to the incident, and they eventually admit that they missed Tracy. Cultural references Invictus is a poem by William Ernest Henley.

Kim Jong-il mentions that Laura Ling left North Korea because \\"she can't party as hard as we can\\". At the end of the episode, there is another clip (possibly from the same movie as the first clip) starring Tracy Jordan and Kim Jong-il. The scene starts out with the \\"Coffee's for closers\\" bit from Glengarry Glen Ross (a movie in which Alec Baldwin, who plays Jack Donaghy, played the part of Blake) before Kim Jong-il says, \\"Luke, I am your father\\" (which is a misquoted line from The Empire Strikes Back), then says \\"Ghostbusters!\\" (in reference to the film). Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 3.95 million households in its original American broadcast.

Razdan was the founding director of the department. It currently offers a five year Bachelor of Architecture course. The department has students from all over India. History The Department of Architecture & Landscape Design (DA&LD;) started in 2006 with the first batch of 40 students. The first three years of the department were spent on shared basis in the buildings of other UG & PG schools of the University. Meanwhile, DA&LD; faculty consider themselves fortunate to have got the job of designing the DA&LD; building under the leadership of First Director of the School Prof. C.L.Razdan. the beautiful design of the building with passionate learning environment was soon ready on paper & the building was ultimately inaugurated on 4 December 2009 by the Chancellor SMVDU & hon‚Äôble Governor of J&K; sh. N.N.Vohra. From the year 2006-2012, Prof. C.L. Razdan with his ideology, \\"Architecture is all about feeling\\", guided and nurtured the new institution to a level where it has made its name among the best institutes in the zone in a short span of time. The college has made its presence felt in the field through its regular participation in National Competitions, its participation in NASA Conventions and made it mark among other colleges by successful organization of Zonal NASA Convention ‚Äì VOGUE in the year 2010. Presently guided by Ar. Aditya K. Singh [Landscape Architect, S.P.A., Delhi], Director, the institute is experiencing the winds of positivity and change. The focus of the institute is to build the ‚Äòsense of space‚Äô among its students while trying to catch the ‚Äòessence or the spirit of architecture‚Äô. Other guides are the architects like Ar. Abhiney Gupta, Ar. Navin Gupta, Ar. Abhimanyu Sharma, Ar. Anoop Sharma and Civil Engineering expert Er. V.K.Dogra. Vision To infuse confidence in the would-be-architect. In nutshell the Architect from the institute has to be made aware of the changing scene put forth by racing progress with its tools. Decadence in built-up-environment is a major concern. To feel concerned for the up gradation of the built-up-environment is the need of the hour. An idea to start a school of Architecture came up in the year 2005-06 keeping in view that: \\"The state has no Department of Architecture. The state is blessed with three distinct regions. Overall Development activity is on the increase. The development in hills is not organized and landscape is getting mutilated. The number of architects in totality is not much in relation to population. The areas of the state are prone to earthquake as the state falls in seismic zone IV. Elements of heritage are getting diluted. Any school of Architecture can be a catalyst in promoting architectural order. The aim of the department would be to create consciousness regarding Architecture, Environment, Built-up form, proper utilization of materials, and resources retaining heritage elements and lastly promoting sustainable development in hills.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official website *http://www.smvdu.ac.in/school-of-architecture-about.html *http://www.smvdu.ac.in *Governor inaugurates NASA convention at SMVDU *ZONAL NASA CONVENTION 2010 *Governor for judicious land use while designing new buildings *https://web.archive.org/web/20111227001123/http://www.coa.gov.in/STATUS.pdf List of Architecture Schools in India Recognized by Council of Architecture,India *http://www.smvdubarch.blogspot.com *Lecture by Prof.Ravindra Bhan *School of Architecture and Landscape Design Category:Universities in Jammu and Kashmir Category:Architecture schools in India ","title":"School of Architecture &amp; Landscape Design, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University"},{"id":"31627336","text":"East of Ealing is a novel by Robert Rankin published in 1984.

Its current holder, since its creation on 29 April 2011, is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, who was granted the title as a personal gift, by Queen Elizabeth II, on the day of his marriage to Catherine Middleton. On the same day he was also created Duke of Cambridge and Earl of Strathearn, with his bride becoming \\"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge\\" as well as Countess of Strathearn and Baroness Carrickfergus as a result of the marriage.

Catherine uses the title \\"Lady Carrickfergus\\" in a fuller version of her titles and styles, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn and Baroness Carrickfergus. History of title and town A barony, referring to Carrickfergus, had previously existed between 1841 and 1883. In 1841, George Chichester, 3rd Marquess of Donegall, was created by Queen Victoria as Baron Ennishowen and Carrickfergus, of Ennishowen, in the County of Donegal, and Carrickfergus, in the County of Antrim, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. When he died in 1883, the Barony of Ennishowen and Carrickfergus became extinct; the Marquessate of Donegall was inherited by his brother, Lord Edward Chichester. Carrickfergus is the oldest town in County Antrim. It has been a major port and town in the Province of Ulster for centuries. Its name translated from Irish means \\"Rock of Fergus\\", and it is an older settlement than the capital city of Northern Ireland, Belfast.

Biohistory is defined, according to biohistorian Stephen Boyden, Stephen Vickers Boyden AM FAA FRSA (born 1925) is an English-born Ecologist and Veterinarian who after graduating with a BSc in London in 1947, worked in Cambridge and Europe before moving to Australia in 1960 and working at the ANU until his official retirement in 1990. He has authored several books on Biohistory, most of which are quoted in this article. * Boyden, Stephen Vickers, Encyclopaedia of Australian Science * Boyden, Stephen, trove.nla.gov.au * www.science.org.au: , , , as a \\"coherent system of knowledge, or field of study, which reflects the broad sequence of happenings in the history of the biosphere and of civilization, from the beginning of life to the present day.\\"Boyden, Stephen Vickers. Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 3. For the historians who study under this school, one of the main principles is the understanding the relationship of the biosphere, the total collection of Earth's ecosystems combined and various human elements, including cultural adaptations and the impact of biological forces on society. One of the things that make biohistory unique is that the \\"starting point is the history of life on Earth, and the basic principles and facts of evolution, genetic inheritance, ecology, and physiology. Next, it turns to consider the evolutionary background, biology and innate sensitivities of the human species, and the emergence in evolution of the human aptitude for culture.\\" Biohistory emerged from several different schools and disciplines including the Annales school, environmental history, human geography, and sociobiology as well as Darwinian Theory.Paulson, Eric. ‚ÄúBiohistory.‚Äù The Occidental Quarterly. Published: May 26, 2010. Accessed: April 3, 2011. http://www.toqonline.com/blog/biohistory/ However, there are biohistorians who work towards eliminating affiliation with Darwinian Theory, especially Social Darwinism, in order to reduce critiques of biological determinism. A similar concept to biohistory, evolutionary biology is different because it only takes into account the scientific aspects of phenomena and not the historical implications. As of 2010, the American Historical Association (AHA) has not accepted biohistory as a legitimate historiographical school of study, though there are academic scholars who study under it. However, for over one hundred years, there have been statements given that suggest an eventual acceptance of the main tenets of biohistory as a basis for future historical research and scholarship. The term biohistory has contested origins because many scholars who write on the topic claim to have coined it.  Biohistory as a field of study  There are scholars within the field of history that say the current study of history does not fully take into account the scope of human history, but ‚Äúomits the events and effects of the longest period of human existence.‚ÄùMcElvaine, Robert S, ‚ÄúThe Relevance of Biohistory‚Äù, The Chronicle Review. 49: 8, October 18, 2002. The ‚Äúlongest period‚Äù referring to the large quantity of time that humans (Homo sapiens) spent adapting and evolving to their environment. Robert S. McElvaine (January 24, 1947- ) argues that the study of history should take into account ‚Äúthe evolution of the particular sort of animals we are.‚Äù History combined with ‚Äúevolutionary biology could provide historians with a means of assessing how changes over long periods of prehistory affect the times we study.‚Äù In 1991, Carl N. Degler (February 6, 1921- ) noted that, as of that time, social scientists in various fields including sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and political scientists had begun to accept the notion that biology, as it describes innate human proclivities, plays an important role in study, but he could not point to any historian that necessarily accepted this notion. Many of the scholars that have influenced biohistory are scientists by nature. Aside from the above list of professionals, geographers, sociobiologists, microbiologists, pathologists, and others have contributed. Human proclivities or the natural tendencies to behave in a certain manners commonly referred to as human nature, which historians can study, include the ability to adapt into small bands of hunter- gatherers. One of the many benefits of studying biohistory is the increased ability for historians and scientists to conduct ‚Äúcollaborative research projects, which offer the potential for unusual analytical perspectives as well as new evolutionary sources‚Äù as stated by Nancy Buenger, an American history scholar.Brueger, Nancy ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research, Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No.3, (2004), 235. Some scholars promote the idea that using biology as a method to history should not only study what features, values, and predispositions of the human condition were favorable in the environment, but also ‚Äúhow those predispositions interacted with the various cultural and historical environments in which humans have lived.‚Äù In the study of biohistory, McElvaine states that biology is a useful tool for history and that both can be utilized to gain a broader perspective of history.  Antecedents and regression  Biohistory has its roots in the late nineteenth century with the evolutionary biology theories of Charles Darwin (February 12, 1809 ‚Äì April 19, 1882). Up until this time, the primary focus of history was to study the lives and events of important people including kings and generals. The topics of biohistory soon began gaining popularity as a study of history. In 1901 the president of the AHA, Charles Francis Adams Jr (May 27, 1835 ‚Äì May 20, 1915), stated that Darwinian Theory ‚Äúwas the dividing line between us [contemporary historians] and the historians of the old school.‚Äù The early movements toward biohistory, however, were not followed and lost momentum due to Franz Boas (July 9, 1859 ‚Äì December 21, 1942) with his research into the differences between biological and cultural evolution. Another group that led to the decline of biohistorical study was the Frankfurt School, a group of neo-Marxist intellectuals that challenged some widely held societal ideologies.  Resurgence  The Annales School, which was formed in the years between the world wars, came into opposition to these critiques of biohistorical research. The idea behind the Annales School was to write a total history which utilized various scientific studies such as geography. Fernand Braudel (August 24, 1902 ‚Äì November 27, 1985), a student of founder Lucien Febvre (July 22, 1878 ‚Äì September 11, 1956), believed that in the study of history, one must remember to consider ‚Äúhumans as living organisms and to not lose sight of the ‚Äòbiological reality of man.‚Äù During the 1970s and 1980s, environmental history gained notoriety as a discipline. It did not take long for environmental history to shift towards using biology to explain history. Alfred W. Crosby, a prominent environmental historian once claimed that ‚Äú[t]he ideology of environmental history is, at its roots, biological.‚ÄùCrosby, Alfred W., ‚ÄúThe Past and Present of Environmental History,‚Äù American Historical Review 100:4, (1995), 1189. He is also noted as combining both principles in several of his books including The Colombian Exchange (1972) and Ecological Imperialism (1986). The study of biohistory, although similar to environmental history, is different in the aspect that it takes into account the environment as well as other biological phenomena in the study of history. In 2001, at the 115th annual conference of the AHA, Edward O. Wilson (June 10, 1929- ), the founder of sociobiology, gave a speech at the 115th annual conference of the AHA in 2001. He stated that ‚Äú[h]istory is no longer just the study of war and peace, of politicians and economics. If the next generation of historians hopes to understand the driving forces of humanity, they need to know the principles of ecology, population genetics and even molecular biology.‚ÄùGareth Cook, ‚ÄúWilson Rattles Historians with ‚ÄòBio-History‚Äô Theories,‚Äù Boston Globe, January 16, 2001. Although not fully recognized as a separate discipline, the 115th AHA conference sponsored a distinct session on biohistory which shows that historians are thinking of the implications of biology on history, though many historians remain skeptical because they do not wish biohistory to be labeled ‚Äúbiological determinism.‚Äù  Early scholars  One of the first contributors to what can be deemed biohistory was Ellsworth Huntington (September 16, 1876 ‚Äì October 17, 1947). Although a geographer by study, Huntington discovered an interesting correlation between the nature of climate, human geography, and culture. In his book, Climate and Civilization published in 1915, he found that there is a positive correlation between the amounts of energy exerted based on climate regions and the perceived areas of civilization.See Huntington, Ellsworth, Civilization and Climate (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1915). Ellsworth defines civilization as ‚Äúthose characteristics which are generally recognized as the highest value.‚ÄùHuntington, Ellsworth, Civilization and Climate (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1915), 150 In 1916, a year after Huntington's work went into circulation, Madison Grant (November 19, 1865 ‚Äì May 30, 1937), a eugenicist, published his work, The Passing of the Great Race; or, The racial basis of European history, which advanced his opinion of Nordic superiority over the Alpine and Mediterranean peoples.Grant, Madison, The Passing of the Great Race, or The Racial Basis of European History (New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1916). These two thinkers utilized biohistory in their research. However, Huntington's work was largely dismissed, although never disproven, and Grant's theories were highly contested and repudiated by the United States and Europe by 1945.  Biohistorical Studies  Biohistory encompasses a wide array of study. It can be used in many different areas that are commonplace in historical study as well as new areas of research. Below, several social aspects and their application are considered.  Biohistory and the Environment  The interplay between the human condition, natural processes, and the environment is important in the study of biohistory. Stephen Vickers Boyden, an historian well-noted for his definition of biohistory, has written extensively about this concept. He has studied various aspects of humanity including weaponry, farming, and society in regard to biological factors in order to better understand this relationship. Under the focus of biohistory Boyden examines the evolution of human progress and thought from its inception thousands of years ago. He is also known for his use of adaptation as a major factor for human progress. There are many types of adaptation, including cultural and evolutionary adaptation, which have shaped and allowed humanity to thrive in many areas of the world and survive as a species.Boyden, Stephen Vickers. Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 4. = The Four Phases = He classifies human existence into four distinct ecological periods: the hunter-gather phase, the early farming phase, the early urban phase, and the high-energy phase. In each phase there is a unique relationship between humanity and the environment.  The Hunter-Gather Phase  : The longest period of the four presented, Boyden claims this phase represents ‚Äúthe only lifestyle and economy known to humankind.‚ÄùBoyden, Stephen Vickers. Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 102. This period is viewed as human populations actively moving to stay in close proximity to food.  The Early Farming Phase  : This period began with the advent of agriculture and includes all farming practices, even into the High Energy Phase. This is symbolic of the first time that human populations began to remain sedentary.  The Early Urban Phase  : With the foundation of cities which occurred over 200 generations ago, this phase and the last phase began to coexist. Humans living in this phase relied on farming communities. Many societal changes and developments were evident during this period. Empires and kingdoms and the constant change of human populations based on these distinctions. This phase ended roughly around the time of the Industrial Revolution, at least for the West, and was centered on the connectivity of human populations with one another.  The High Energy Phase  : This period of time is considerably the shortest of the four. This phase roughly began at the time of the Industrial Revolution in England. It is defined by the expanded use of resources and energy which power machines. Boyden states that this current phase is unsustainable and will not last long if the current trend continues. Boyden defines this process as ecodeviation.Boyden, Stephen Vickers. Biohistory: The Interplay Between Human Society and the Biosphere. (New Jersey: Parthenon Publishing Group Inc., 1992), 102-103.See Boyden, Stephen Vickers, Western Civilization in Biological Perspective: Patterns in Biohistory, (Michigan: Clarendon Press, 1990). Boyden states that if the human race were to survive in the future then there is the necessity to enter into a fifth phase. This new phase would have to be more sustainable than the current one. Ellsworth Huntington's research also speaks to the nature of humanity and the environment. His work on the nature of the climate of an area and the rate of perceived civilization provides a framework for the seemingly complex interaction among humans and the environment.  Biohistory and race  There are many different methods that can be applied to the study of race and race relations under the biohistorical method. There are scholars, like Robert McElvaine, who say that ‚Äúbiohistory seeks to illuminate aspects of history through a better understanding of human nature ‚Äì the fundamental traits and predispositions that all humans share and that make us alike‚Äù which eliminates the necessity of the study of race. Other scholars, however, see validity in the study of the differences that make people unique. In their study, S. O. Y. Keita and Rick A. Kittles found that ‚Äú[r]acial thinking rests on the belief that visible human variation connotes fundamental deep differences within the species, which can be packaged into units of near-uniform individuals.‚ÄùKieta, S.OY. and Rick A. Kittles, ‚ÄúThe Persistence of Racial Thinking and the Myth of Racial Divergence,‚Äù The American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 99, No. 3 (Sep., 1997), 534. Race biohistorians use many different methods in their study. Scholars use dental morphology, bone structure data, and DNA testing to identify certain aspects of racial identity and growth. One common practice is to use scientific data to explain certain aspects of race. One scholar, Heather J.H. Edgar, used teeth samples and other genetic identifiers to test her hypotheses. She used these samples to check evolutionary change of both European Americans and African Americans and societal perceptions of Americans of each group.Edgar, Heather J.H., ‚ÄúBiohistorical Approaches to ‚ÄòRace‚Äô in the United States: Biological Distances Among African Americans, European Americans and Their Ancestors,‚Äù American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Vol. 39 (2009). Through her study she found the idea of ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù changed over a small length of time to include Eastern Europeans, while the idea of ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù has changed very little over the 400 years that there has been contact with Americans. Although never actually accepted as valid, the research of Madison Grant, which advocated the idea of Nordic superiority, is another example of racial biohistoric study. His book outlined his belief that the Mediterranean and Alpine races were causing various problems in the political structure of Europe and the United States. = Biohistory and African Americans = Many race historians have studied biohistory in relation to African Americans. Like Heather Edgar, Lesley M. Rankin-Hill in her dissertation, focused mainly on the conditions, especially the prevalence of disease, of free African Americans, including the population of blacks at the First African Baptist Church in Philadelphia.Rankin-Hill, Lesley M. Afro-American Biohistory: Theoretical and Methodological Considerations. (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1992). Through her research, using bone, teeth, and other samples, one of her findings was that ‚Äúfree Philadelphia Afro-Americans were generally healthier than their slave or emancipated counterparts.‚ÄùRankin- Hill, Lesley M. Afro-American Biohistory: Theoretical and Methodological Considerations. (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1992), xi. In her article, Fatimah Linda Collier Jackson describes various factors and their effects on the African American population. She states that along with the continent of Africa having had the longest history of human habitation African American biological variation is also a product of the great Atlantic Diaspora, a movement that was initiated with the social and economic disruptions in Africa preceding the trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans peoples and includes the forced march of prisoners of war to the sea for transport, the dynamics of the horrific Middle Passage and the seasoning process, and the biological and biocultural readjustments of Africans to enslavement in the AmericasJackson, Fatimah Linda Collier, ‚ÄúEvolutionary and Political Economic Influences on Biological Diversity in African Americans,‚Äù Journal of Black Studies, Vol. 23: No. 4, (June 1993), 539.  Biohistory and gender studies  Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 ‚Äì July 4, 1826), third President of the United States once wrote, ‚Äú[t]he stronger sex imposes on the weaker. It is civilization alone which replaces women in their natural equality.‚Äù This quote is reflective of the relationship that has existed between man and women throughout most of human history.McElvaine, Robert S., Eve‚Äôs Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History, (New York: McGraw Hill, 2001), 3 Robert S. McElvaine, author of Eve's Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and Human History, explains the relationship between men and women through a biological framework. His research focuses on the idea that instead of women having penis envy, men have breast and/or womb envy. This can be attributed to the fact that ‚Äú[p]regnancy, birthing, and nursing have always constituted a ‚Äòno man‚Äôs land.‚Äô‚Äù With these areas that men were not allowed, they In response to this circumstance...have, throughout history and across cultures, set up a variety of ‚Äòno woman‚Äôs land‚Äô: war, politics, clergy, business, men's clubs, and so forth. From which activities women are excluded varies from one culture to another, but some form of exclusion can be found in all societies McElvaine argues that it is this distinction that has driven men to subordinate women. Through various studies, he also hypothesizes that women were responsible for the agriculture, which took control and power away from the males, of which males soon took back power.McElvaine, Robert S., Eve‚Äôs Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History, (New York: McGraw Hill, 2001), Ch. 4. McElvaine asserts that it throughout history, it is this interaction and struggle, among others, between the sexes that led to the subordination of women. Of Robert McElvaine and his research, some say that he almost accurately presents the masculine/feminine dichotomy in relation to environmental and biological factors.  Another branch of biohistory  Aside from the above-stated study of biohistory there is another branch that is more accessible to the public. This branch of biohistory is concerned with using science to not only validate history, but to form historical conclusions about certain events or trends that cannot be noted otherwise. It uses various methods that are also associated with the other branch of study such as DNA testing and other methods to determine specific characteristics of specific individuals and/or artifacts. Both historians, scholars, and amateur historians are able to partake of this study.Buenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004).Russell Lewis. ‚ÄúJudgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.‚Äù The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1, (2006). This is because individuals and organizations are more able to petition for and conduct studies. Individuals can often cause a stir, such as this support group's letter to the Chicago Historical Society, ‚ÄúI thought that a ‚Äòhistorical‚Äô society wanted to ferret out truth. Where is that line in the sand drawn‚Äîwhat we ignorant heathens are permitted to learn about historical figures and what is off limits to us? And who draws that line‚Äîthe Chicago Historical Society?‚ÄùBuenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 230. Russell Lewis states that as a biohistorian he ‚Äúfelt compelled to undertake this research by the promise of finding new clues, new evidence, perhaps even new understandings of the past in dirt and stains and grit and grime that typically would be removed from an artifact during cleaning.‚ÄùRussell Lewis. ‚ÄúJudgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.‚Äù The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 96 This can be considered a common approach and desire for many biohistorians under this method.  Examples  On April 25, 2011, Wynne Parry wrote an article for MSNBC about the unknown child aboard the Titanic. For years there have been speculations about the identity of this young boy. Through misleading evidence, researchers have inaccurately identified the child numerous times.Parry, Wynne, ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äôs Unknown Child is Finally Identified,‚Äù NBC News, April 25, 2011, accessed: April 26, 2011, http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42755013. The use of genetics to solve this problem began a decade ago. Robert Parr, an adjunct professor familiar with extraction and DNA testing pursued one claim. Through mitochondrial DNA test of the remains, he tested the DNA with that of the siblings of the perceived child. When results did not match, the search continued. After another false identification due to perceived age, researchers have agreed on the identity of the child, Sidney Goodwin. Even with looking at other factors including teeth structures, researchers misidentified the child. Ryan Parr commented, ‚ÄúLuckily, it was a rare difference, so that is what gives you 98 percent certainty the identification is correct.‚Äù The possibility exists that the child may still be inappropriately identified, but this case shows how this branch of biohistory works. This form of biohistory was also used with artifacts of Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 ‚Äì April 15, 1865). The Chicago Historical Society has the largest collection of artifacts and items related to the late President. There are many scholars and amateur historians that have the desire to ‚Äúexemplify biohistorical quests that typically involve the authentication of historical remains and artifacts, the resolution of speculative medical history or paternity disputes, or the commercial potential of genetic analysis.‚ÄùBuenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 229. The CHS was constantly asked to conduct DNA testing on several of Lincoln's personal items in order to find out various facts including ‚Äúproof whether or not he suffered from Marfan‚Äôs syndrome.‚ÄùRussell Lewis. ‚ÄúJudgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.‚Äù The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 97. Others have stated interest in conducting aDNA tests on the bloody cloak of Mary Lincoln, wife of Abraham. These types of claims and research are an integral part of this branch of biohistory.  Ethical standards  Some scholars have developed a set of ethical standards for biohistorical study. These ethical standards are largely associated with the branch of study that uses science to validate history since the other branch does not necessarily require such standards since the nature of study does not directly have any debilitating consequences. There have been concerns with the scope of biohistorical research as the study has grown in popularity. Russell Lewis stated that a ‚Äúreview of professional codes for twenty-three scientific, historical, and cultural organizations showed a lack of inconsistency and insufficient concern for ethical values that should inform biohistorical investigation.‚ÄùRussell Lewis. ‚ÄúJudgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.‚Äù The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 98. Some aspects of biohistorical research that can be detrimental towards understanding include the destruction of fragile and/or antique artifacts, unreliable and wrong data attributed as fact due to scientific reasoning, and the defamation and other consequences that can affect living populations associated with what is being studied. This last point is especially true of studies dealing with people who are deceased. Because ‚Äú[b]iohistory often involves an identifiable object and genetic analysis of tissue can reveal information about the paternity, health status, and predispositions of family members‚Äù there is the potential for biohistoric research to lead to inappropriate claims as well as other areas of defamation.Buenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 232. In one study done by the Chicago Historical Society they ‚Äúconcluded that DNA testing [one of the most widely accepted forms of biohistorical research] would damage the artifacts [here referring to the Society‚Äôs Abraham Lincoln collection].‚ÄùRussell Lewis. ‚ÄúJudgments of Value, Judgments of Fact: The Ethical Dimension of Biohistorical Research.‚Äù The Public Historian, Vol. 28: No. 1 (2006), 93 Buenger states that \\"[g]reater consideration should be given to basic techniques, such as detailed visual or microscopical examination\\" which are less destructive rather than rely on DNA and similar tests.Buenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 235.  Procedures and guidelines  The norm of scientific validation and [b]iohistorical research proposals have generated historical, scientific, and social concerns, including the justification for the proposed research, appropriateness of the study design, destruction of fragile museum specimens, the relevance of informed consent, potential harm to live relatives, cultural respect for the dead, confidentiality of medical and genetic information, and the interpretation of study results which has led to a call for some ethical standards to set a framework for study. Through her evaluation of biohistorical ethical standards Nancy Buenger came up with a series of questions that should be answered by those doing the research. She broke them down into three areas: Historical, Scientific, and Social Considerations. Some of the questions that she states need to be asked include: * Is the provenance of proposed biological samples reliable? * Do the investigators have previous experience and a reasonable success rate with the proposed materials and methodologies? * What are the potential negative consequences of biohistorical knowledge for human subjects as well as their relatives and communities?Buenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 234. For a full list of her ethical considerations click here . One debate coming out of the rise of biohistorical research centers on whether or not these studies should be conducted based on cultural and societal beliefs. There are those that say ‚Äúcranial dimensions‚Äù and other scientific measurements ‚Äúshould trump notions of cultural affiliation.‚ÄùBuenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 233. Then there are those that ask if this kind of study should be paramount because of certain significances that some societies hold true that can be eliminated with scientific discovery.  Interpretations  As with any intellectual school of thought, there exist critiques, criticisms, and praise for biohistory. Below are a few examples of both positive and negative critiques.  Positive  The study of biohistory allows for the possibility of collaboration between historians and scientists, in a way that has rarely been seen before. This collaboration allows for better understanding between the disciplines because ‚Äú[t]hey need the insights of historians to mediate between humans‚Äô evolutionary inheritance and modern behavior as much as historians and social scientists need the insights of biologists to understand better the motivations behind the historical behavior we study.‚Äù The study of biohistory allows for historians to consider an aspect of historical research that has not been considered before. Biohistory also opens up the scope of study to the beginning of human existence into prehistory, which goes back many more years than historians normally like to go back.  Negative  Aside from the collaboration that can be a product of this type of study, there are many scholars who find fault with biohistory. One major critique of biohistory is the continued repetition of ideas from scholar to scholar. In a review of Stephen Boyden‚Äôs book, Western Civilization in the Biological Perspective: Patterns in Biohistory, one such scholar states that ‚Äú[r]eaders who are familiar with other works in biohistory by Ren√© Dubos, D. B. Grigg, C.J. Glacken, Donald Worster, and William McNeill will find little that is new.‚ÄùCrosby, Alfred W, ‚ÄúReview [untitled]\\" Isis, Vol. 80: No. 1, (March 1989), 161. Another critique is that biohistory encompasses too vast a scope. To start from the beginning of the human condition creates too wide a spread of time, leaving room for much speculation. That is because there is not much data and knowledge about the early times studied, leading biohistorians to speculate and possibly make invalid assumptions. Another critique is that many biohistorians rely on too much science in their research. In trying to make assertions about certain historical issues, many are limited in their areas of study to just focusing on scientific aspects while leaving out others. One scholar, in review of Lesley M. Rankin-Hill‚Äôs book, A Biohistory of 19th Century Afro-Americans: The Burial Remains of a Pennsylvania Cemetery, stated that while supporting her hypothesis with examples and statistics that she promotes others have not considered, ‚ÄúRankin- Hill charts out, and then gets bogged down in, the model she will use in her ‚Äòbiocultural analysis‚Äô‚Äù that she fails to present any new evidence.Savitt, Todd L, ‚ÄúReview: [untitled],‚Äù The Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Vol. 28: No. 4. (March 1998), 682. Referring to the CHS and the collection of Lincoln's items, Nancy Brueger states that in their general study Historians are most interested in analyses that illuminate broad cultural, economic, political, or social trends. The authenticity of an individual artifact such as CHS's cloak would not significantly contribute to the reevaluation of President Lincoln's assassination or the social impact of this event.Buenger, Nancy. ‚ÄúConnective Tissues: Ethical Guidelines for Biohistorical Research.‚Äù Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, Vol. 43: No. 3 (2004), 231.

It serves as the home of the Los Angeles County Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. Patriotic hall was rededicated to honor of Bob Hope and renamed \\"Bob Hope Patriotic Hall\\" on November 12, 2004. History Patriotic Hall was built in 1925 and the building opened its doors in 1926 to serve the public. When it was built, the building was the tallest building in the city. Design The building was designed by Allied Architects Association (33 prominent architects in Los Angeles) using Romanesque features. The lobby was designed with vaulted arch construction and contains murals on the walls. A three panel mural created by A.J. Leitner called Soldiers and Sailors occupies one of the vestibules of the building. Created as part of the Works Progress Administration, the murals depict uniformed U.S. military personnel from 1776 to 1941. A series of lobby murals completed by Helen Lundeberg as part of the Works Progress Administration were removed in the 1970s, and are now considered missing. In 2013, muralist Kent Twitchell unveiled We the People, Out of Many, One, a series of murals which occupies the site of Lundeberg's original work. Twitchell's murals pay homage to Lundeberg's design, while depicting real life veterans and other people associated with the military. Awards A Certificate of Honor has been awarded to the building for its exceptional merit by the Southern California Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, and it was placed on the State‚Äôs Register of Historical Resources on 27 February 1976. The building was built on land deeded by Civil War veterans. Other notable events Arianna Huffington hosted a Shadow convention in Patriotic Hall while the 2000 Democratic National Convention took place in Staples CenterList of Democratic National Conventions Refurbishment In 2006, the building was temporarily closed so that it could be renovated. The renovations included: * Updated mechanical systems * ADA upgrades, including new parking stalls * Updated meeting, conference and office spaces * Refurbished gym * 500-seat auditorium * Full-service kitchen The renovated Patriotic Hall was completed in 2013 at a cost of $46 million. In more active years, Patriotic Hall was the headquarters and/or a mailing address for hundreds of organizations. Once renovation was completed, the original veteran service organizations were invited back into the building, this includes: * American Legion Post 8 * World War II Veterans Groups * County offices such as the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which returned to the building on August 26, 2013 under its new director, Brig. Gen. Ruth A. Wong. Ownership and management Bob Hope Patriotic Hall is owned by the County of Los Angeles. Operations are managed by the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. Current purpose The hall is the home to military artifacts and memorabilia. It also houses documents from wars and conflicts starting with the American Revolutionary War, and including recent Middle East conflicts. At the rededication ceremonies in 2013, American Legion member and past California Department Commander Hugh Crooks Jr expressed appreciation that the building was being rededicated back to the veterans: ‚ÄúThis is not just for past veterans. It is also for future vets. All future vets will know that this building in Los Angeles County is their building. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs here for. That‚Äôs what it will always be for.‚Äù Location The building is less than a mile from Staples Center and LA Live. It is visible from both interstate 10 (Santa Monica Freeway) and State Route 110 (Harbor Freeway). The structure is located at 1816 S. Figueroa Street, Los Angeles, California, 90015. Figueroa Street was a part of the old US Highway 6. It is west from Historic South Central neighborhood. It is only one block from the Metro A Line train station at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. Collections There are many artifacts stored in the hall. They have been documented and cataloged. The estimated worth of the collection is valued at more than $1 million. Included are: * Uniforms from Winston Churchill, General George Patton, General Norman Schwarzkopf. * Historic flags * Historic weapons * Original oil paintings by naval artist Arthur Beaumont. Much of the collection is property of American Legion Post 8. Display cases hold these valuable artifacts.

Florida Hospital system At both Shawnee Mission and Florida Hospital Spiritual Ambassadors are hospital employees who have a desire to provide Christian service above and beyond their job duties. The Florida Hospital program feels employees become Spiritual Ambassadors as a result of answering God's call to serve as a Spiritual Ambassador. Florida Hospital provides a half day of training for its Spiritual Ambassadors. Representatives from the Mission Development center coordinate the training sessions. The training involves the use of a flyer and a thirty-six page booklet, as well as audiovisual materials.Vimeo website; Spiritual Ambassadors: Living Our Mission (Oralndo: Florida Hospital Mission Development, 2011), p. 3; Spiritual Ambassadors: Living Our Passion (Orlando: Florida Hospital Mission Development, 2011), p. 3.

A Spiritual Ambassador can become involved in a variety of activities to serve. This same booklet lists thirty such activities and this list is not intended to be all inclusive. For instance, many Spiritual Ambassadors lead or coordinate daily work unit devotions and set up prayer and devotion boards in their units. They also sometimes have devotion and prayer updates in departmental meetings and newsletters. They also sometimes act as liaisons between patients and hospital chaplains.Spiritual Ambassadors: Living Our Passion, pp. 18, 30-2. Some hospitals have utilized Spiritual Ambassadors for various outreach programs. Florida Hospital Heartland Division encourages its Ambassadors to record devotion messages in its \\"Dial-A-Devotion\\" program. Various hospitals have set up food pantries to help employees who have fallen on difficult times. Also, one hospital holds a single parent Christmas party to help employee single parents enjoy Christmas more fully. Some hospitals have set up programs to provide clean clothing to emergency department patients in need of clothing.Spiritual Ambassadors: Living Our Passion, pp. 29, 33. Shawnee Mission Medical Center Shawnee Mission Medical Center describes the SAFE program in a series of videos on the internet. A paragraph of text accompanies the video sites: \\"The aim of SAFE is to provide support to the associates of each hospital unit/department at [the hospital], and to the people they serve, through the intentional service of a peer who has both the gifts and training of a caring ministry. The Spiritual Ambassador will give encouragement during times of stress, lend crisis support, all while modeling the principle of our mission - Improving health through Christian Service.\\" The mission of Florida Hospital is stated a bit differently. It is \\"Extending the Healing Ministry of Christ.\\"Vimeo website, http://vimeo.com/20038904 ; \\"Spiritual Ambassadors: Living Our Passion,\\" p. 2. Shawnee Mission has six videos.

Hemithioacetals ordinarily readily dissociate into thiol and aldehyde, however some have been isolated. In general these isolable hemithioacetals are cyclic, which disfavors dissociation, and can often be further stabilized by the presence of acid. An important class are S-glycosides, such as octylthioglucoside, which are formed by a reaction between thiols and sugars. Other examples include 2-hydroxytetrahydrothiophene and the anti-HIV drug Lamivudine. Another class of isolable hemithioacetals are derived from carbonyl groups that form stable hydrates. For example, thiols react with hexafluoroacetone trihydrate to give hemithioacetals, which can be isolated. Hemithioacetals in nature Glyoxalase I, which is part of the glyoxalase system present in the cytosol, catalyzes the conversion of Œ±-oxoaldehyde (RC(O)CHO) and the thiol glutathione (abbreviated GSH) to S-2-hydroxyacylglutathione derivatives [RCH(OH)CO-SG]. The catalytic mechanism involves an intermediate hemithioacetal adduct [RCOCH(OH)-SG]. The spontaneous reaction forms methylglyoxal-glutathione hemithioacetal and human glyoxalse I. A hemithioacetal is also invoked in the mechanism of prenylcysteine lyase. In catalytic mechanism, S-farnesylcysteine is oxidized by a flavin to a thiocarbenium ion. The thiocarbenium ion hydrolyzes to form the hemithioacetal: 650px After formation, the hemithioacetal breaks into hydrogen peroxide, farnesal, and cysteine.

He is noted for the excellence of perspective in his paintings, on which he wrote a dissertation in 1843. His fascination with Spain and Italy stemmed from what had become something of a tradition for romantic European painters. Accordingly he visited Andalus√≠a and saw its important buildings like the Alhambra of Granada. He was professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, from 1855 until 1876.

He died at the age of 32, shortly after his marriage.Jenkins (1991) p. 167 Rugby career Williams first played rugby as a schoolboy, representing Llangennech School, before progressing to the Llangennech club. He switched to first-class side Llanelli, and while at the club he was first selected for the Wales national side in a game against the 1924 touring New Zealanders. Initially the Aberavon forward, Bob Randall, had been the preferred choice as hooker, but withdrew with a knee injury, allowing Williams to take his place.Billot (1972) p.67 The match was a one-sided affair with Wales outclassed in speed and combination, but the Welsh forwards worked tirelessly against a much heavier pack.Billot (1972) p.68 The game ended 19-0 to New Zealand.

Ships of the class were also known as \\"90-day gunboats\\" due to their rapid construction. The class was designed to be fully oceangoing while having a light enough draft to be able to operate close inshore, for blockade duty or other operations in shallow waters. Unadilla-class gunboats took part in many coastal and river operations, most notably as the bulk of the fleet which captured the vital Confederate port of New Orleans in April 1862. As blockade ships, the 23 vessels of the class captured or destroyed no fewer than 146 enemy blockade runners during the war-- about 10 percent of the total number of Confederate blockade runners so neutralized. The Unadilla class was sold off quickly by the Navy at the end of the war, most of them going into merchant service. Little is known about their subsequent careers. Construction and design=Development With the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, the U.S. Navy was faced with an urgent need for light-draft gunboats able to operate both at sea and close inshore to help enforce the Union blockade of Confederate ports. Since the Navy's Chief Engineer, Benjamin F. Isherwood, had recently designed and overseen construction at the Novelty Iron Works in New York City of the engines for two similar gunboats, built for the Imperial Russian Navy, he had to hand a ready-made design suitable for the new U.S. Navy gunboats, which was accepted by Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles.Sloan, pp. 30-31.Tucker 2006, p. 35. The two men agreed, as a time-saving measure, to award the first four engine contracts directly to the Novelty Works, dispensing with the usual tendering process; in the event the contracts for all 23 vessels of the class would be signed between 29 June and 10 July without Congressional approval. As a result, the first four vessels of the new Unadilla class were completed in the remarkably short time of about three months, earning the class as a whole the popular name \\"90-day gunboats\\". Contract distribution and cost All ships of the class were built in privately owned shipyards along the Eastern seaboard. Six contracts went to New York shipbuilders, five to the State of Maine, four to Massachusetts, three each to Connecticut and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and one each to Delaware and Maryland. No individual shipyard built more than one ship. By contrast, reflecting the relative strength of the States' industrial bases, more than half the machinery contracts went to New York-based companies--seven to the Novelty Works, three to the Morgan Iron Works and two to the Allaire Works--while Pennsylvania companies accounted for another four, Massachusetts for three, Connecticut two and Delaware and Maryland one each.Silverstone, p. 49. Overall cost of the individual ships varied between $90,000 and $103,500, with cost of the hulls varying between $52,000 and $58,500. The largest price differential was for the machinery contracts, the first four of which, with the Novelty Works, were for only $31,500, as opposed to the $42,000 to $46,500 for the later ships.Kettell, p. 189. The difference is probably due primarily to the fact that the later vessels had 60% more boiler power than the original four. Total cost of all 23 vessels was $2,170,000. Hulls The hulls of the Unadilla-class gunboats may have been modelled on the 1860 rebuild of The hulls of the Unadilla-class gunboats were designed by Samuel H. Pook, under the direction of the Navy's Chief of the Bureau of Construction, Equipment and Repairs, John Lenthall. The design was possibly based on the 1860 rebuild of , designed by Pook's father Samuel M. Pook. The hulls were in length on the waterline, with a beam of , hold depth of and draft of . Some details of the six New York-built vessels are available. These ships had frames, keels and keelsons of white oak \\"of the best quality\\", with port stanchions of locust and live oak. The keels and keelsons were fastened with corrosion-resistant copper bolts. The hulls were strengthened with diagonal iron braces, secured amidships \\"at the turn of the bilge\\" and running upward at a 45¬∞ angle to the outer frames. The ship stems were also strengthened with iron strapping. According to some sources, ships of the class were built with unseasoned timber and would therefore have been expected to have short working lives.Silverstone, p. 51. Machinery The ships of the Unadilla class were each powered by a pair of bore, stroke horizontal back-acting engines, driving a single screw propeller.Silverstone, p. 50. As with the hulls, additional details for the machinery of the six New York-built ships are available; the machinery of the others was similar if not identical. The New York-built ships had two boilers each, of the Martin's vertical tubular type, placed side by side and spaced six inches apart. The boilers, \\"made of the best quality American charcoal iron\\", were 12 ft 3 in long, 8 ft 3 in wide and 9 ft 3 in high, with two furnaces each. The boilers were safety tested to a pressure of 60 psi before installation. The engines were fitted with Sewell's patent surface condensers. The ships' propellers were four-bladed, and nine feet in diameter with a mean blade pitch of 12 feet 6 inches.Notes on Shipbuilding and the Construction of Machinery in New York and Vicinity\\", Scientific American, New Series, Volume 5, Issue 26, p. 405, 1861-12-28. Sources vary as to the speed of the ships. Some give a speed of 10 knots, but 8 to 9 knots seems to have been the typical speed during the war. Recorded speeds vary all the way from 6 knots to 11.5 knots.See the DANFS articles for the individual ships. In all likelihood, the performance of the vessels was less than ideal in wartime conditions due to infrequency of maintenance, particularly for the boilers. Launch and commission USS Unadilla under construction at the yard of John Englis, New York The first vessel of the class, Unadilla, was launched on 17 August 1861, barely two months after the signing of the contract. The rest rapidly followed, with another three being launched in August, four in September, fourteen in October and the last one, Penobscot, in November. Unadilla was again first to be commissioned, on 30 September, just 93 days after the laying of her keel. A total of eleven were commissioned before the end of the year, and another eleven by February 1862. Marblehead was the last ship of the class to enter commission, on 8 March. Though popularly known as the \\"90-day gunboats\\" then, only the first four vessels of the class were commissioned in anything like 90 days. The rest took an average of about three months just to launch. Overall, the ships averaged a little under six months from signing of the contract to commission.Calculated from Bauer and Roberts, pp. 74-75. Armament and complement Vessels of the class were initially armed with one Dahlgren smoothbore cannon; two 24-pounder smoothbores and a single 20-pounder Parrott rifle. As the war continued, most of them were upgunned on an ad hoc basis, so that they ended up with a variety of different armaments. The crew complement is listed in some recent sources as 114 officers and men; however, DANFS and other sources give varying figures for the individual ships, ranging from a complement of 65 (Sciota) to 94 (Aroostook), with an average per ship of 80. The reason for these apparent discrepancies is unknown. Performance Sources vary as to the performance of the Unadilla class. According to Bauer and Roberts, the ships \\"sailed well in a strong wind and handled easily but rolled badly.\\"Bauer and Roberts, pp. 74-75. Gardiner is less generous, describing the vessels as \\"poor sailors; their machinery frequently broke down; the steering mechanism was inefficient; and they were slow; maximum speed being 8-9 knots.\\"Gardiner, pp. 62-63. Thomas Main, a well-known contemporary engineer, criticized the engines of the class as \\"unusually heavy in all their parts\\", a common criticism of Isherwood's engines by private contractors. According to Main, the engines were fully 2.78 times heavier than required, leading to reduced efficiency and performance. Main notes that with a speed of only around 9 knots, the vessels were incapable of catching the faster blockade runners with speeds of 12 to 14 knots.Main, pp. 188-190, 205-206. Whatever their shortcomings, gunboats of the class were nonetheless to accumulate an \\"impressive\\" record of service during the war. Service history Though the main task of the Unadilla class was simply to enforce the blockade of Confederate ports in line with the Anaconda Plan, many ships of the class also participated in related operations against Confederate forts and population centers along the Southern coastline and its rivers. These operations included shore raids and invasions, bombardments, and engagements with enemy land or naval forces. Battle of Port Royal The first major such operation involving ships of the class occurred after the U.S. Navy determined that a supply port deep in Confederate territory would be required in order to effectively enforce the blockade of the Confederate coastline.Browning, pp. 23-24. In late October 1861, a large fleet of 77 ships, including 19 warships--the largest fleet then assembled by the Navy-- departed New York with the capture of Port Royal, South Carolina as its objective.Browning, pp. 27-28. On 4 November, four gunboats of the fleet, including the Unadilla-class vessels , and , provided protection for the survey vessel as the latter made soundings in Port Royal harbor. The following morning, the same three Unadilla-class ships and two other gunboats returned to the harbor to engage the Confederate forts and gauge their strength.Browning, pp. 30-31. On 7 November, the entire Naval battle fleet, including the three previously mentioned Unadilla-class vessels along with a fourth, USS Unadilla, engaged and defeated the two enemy forts, thus capturing the harbor. Port Royal would subsequently become a key supply port for the Union cause.Browning, p. 41. Capture of New Orleans Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip--map and order of battle The largest and most important contribution made by ships of the Unadilla class to a single operation was to the capture of New Orleans, the Confederacy's largest and most economically powerful city, in April 1862. For the operation, Captain David Farragut, Commander of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, assembled a fleet of 17 warships including nine Unadilla-class gunboats: , , , , , , , and .Tucker 2010, pp. 216-217. On the night of April 20, Farragut despatched three of his Unadilla-class gunboats, Itasca, Kineo and Pinola to remove the chains obstructing the Mississippi River below New Orleans. Though coming under heavy but inaccurate fire from Forts Jackson and St. Philip, the vessels were able to clear a narrow passage. On the night of the 24th, Farragut took the bulk of his fleet through the passage, though three of his Unadilla-class gunboats, Itasca, Kennebec and Winona, became entangled in the river obstructions and were forced to turn back.Tucker 2010, p. 224. The rest of the fleet, however, continued on to New Orleans, which was forced to capitulate a few days later.Fiske, pp. 128-129. Vicksburg campaign The capture of New Orleans enabled Naval forces to move further north along the Mississippi to threaten the key Confederate city of Vicksburg. Several ships of the class were subsequently involved in the ensuing Vicksburg Campaign. For example, in June 1862, several vessels of the class were involved in the \\"run past Vicksburg\\" to link up with the naval forces of the upper Mississippi, although this action proved to be of little significance. In August, Cayuga, Katahdin, Kineo and Sciota were involved in the Battle of Baton Rouge, and Katahdin and Winona in the recapture of the city in December. Vicksburg was however far too well defended to be threatened by the Navy, and defeat of the Confederate forces in this theater of operations was ultimately left to the Army. Other actions The Unadilla class was involved in numerous other operations against enemy-held territory during the war, most notably the Battle of Mobile Bay in August 1864 and the First and Second battles of Fort Fisher in December 1864 and January 1865 respectively. The main duty of the class, however, was maintenance of the blockade along the Confederate coast. While vessels of the class were too slow to catch the faster blockade runners, they nonetheless accumulated an impressive record of prizes during the war, capturing or destroying no less than 146 blockade runners during the war--almost 10% of the total number of blockade runners neutralized by the Union blockade.Silverstone, p. 8. Silverstone gives a total of precisely 1,500 blockade runners captured or destroyed during the war. The 146 vessels neutralized by the Unadilla class therefore represents 9.7% of the total. The most successful of the Unadillas in this regard were , with 21 prizes; Kanawha with 19; and with 13 each; and and with 11 apiece.Silverstone, pp. 49-54. Only one ship of the class, Sciota, was sunk during the war, but ironically this vessel was sunk on two separate occasions. The first occurred on 14 July 1863 when collided with Sciota on the Mississippi, sinking the latter in about 12 feet of water.Silverstone, p. 53. Sciota was raised and returned to service, but shortly after the war, on 14 July 1865--the day of Lincoln's assassination --Sciota ran onto a mine in Mobile Bay and was sunk a second time. Again she was salvaged, but this time only to be sold out of the Navy. Postwar service Chinese waters, ca. 1867 After the war, most of the ships of the Unadilla-class were quickly decommissioned and sold into merchant service. Seventeen had been decommissioned by August 1865, and fifteen of these had been sold by the end of the year, with the remaining two, Seneca and Penobscot, seeing no further naval service and being sold in 1868 and 1869 respectively. Some of these vessels were still in existence as late as 1885. Of the remaining six, Chocura and Tahoma briefly saw service with the Gulf Squadron in 1866-67 before being decommissioned and sold in the latter half of 1867; Marblehead saw service with the North Atlantic Squadron, and Huron in South American waters, until their decommission in late 1868 and subsequent sale. The last two vessels of the class to see service with the Navy, and Unadilla, were transferred to the newly established Asiatic Squadron in 1867 and subsequently employed in the suppression of piracy along the coast of China. In June 1868, Unadilla became the first American warship to enter Siam's Chao Phraya River, bearing gifts from the President of the United States, Andrew Johnson, to Chulalongkorn, King of Siam.\\"The United States Steamer Unadilla in the East Indies\\", The Sun, p. 1, 1868-09-01 (paysite). In 1869, both Aroostook and Unadilla were condemned as unfit for further service due to rotting hulls--a legacy of their construction with unseasoned timber-- and they were sold shortly thereafter. Unadilla became the merchant Dang Wee and was sunk in a collision off Hong Kong in the fall of 1870; Aroostooks later history, like that of most other vessels of the class, is unknown.

Scientific matters at this time were of little interest as exploration was mostly commercially and politically motivated. Captivated by the lure of gold, silver and spices, Portuguese and Spanish sailors pioneered new trade routes to the Indies. The Age of Discovery was followed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by the Age of Enlightenment (also known as the Age of Reason) which was an era of scientific awakening with a strong belief in the power of reason as the primary source of legitimacy and authority.see Oxford Dictionary Scientific fervour and intellectual curiosity at this time resulted in many voyages of scientific exploration around the world facilitated by technological innovations that included the theodolite, octant, precision clocks, as well as improvements in the compass, telescope, and general shipbuilding techniques. Naturalists, including botanists and zoologists, were an integral part of these voyages and the new discoveries were recorded not only in their journals but by on-board illustrators and artists. Among the naturalists on these colonial voyages of scientific exploration were gardener-botanists.British Museum - Plant Collectors Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the naturalists on these expeditions, mostly as botanical assistants, collecting live plants and seed, as well as plant specimens for herbarium collections. They often maintained journals and records of their collections and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. Their specialist skills as horticulturist-gardeners were often combined with a knowledge of botany as they cared for the economically important plant cargos, often living, on the long sea journeys. Gardener-botanists were instrumental in the transport around the globe of newly discovered ornamental plants for the estates of the European wealthy, as well as crops like spices, breadfruit, coffee, quinine, rubber and other important economic crops, a duty that required specially designed cabinets and equipment like the Wardian Case. Their lowly status as gardeners meant that their history has been overshadowed by that of their botanical supervisors. Naturalists on these expeditions generally enjoyed the privileges of the officers ‚Äî including eating with the captain and the relative comfort of special sleeping quarters; in contrast, the gardeners would be bunked with the crew. The best-known gardener-botanists included those sent from the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace in Vienna, but mainly the Jardin du Roi (after the Revolution this became the Jardin des Plantes at the Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle) in Paris and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London as France and Britain sought to expand their colonial empires and influence by sea. Sent by Andr√© Thouin from the Jardin du Roi During the Enlightenment both France and England organised elaborate programs of plant introduction to explore the potential of plants not only as food for their colonies but as botanical novelties of all kinds. In Paris the project planning was placed in the hands of the Head Gardener of the Jardin du Roi, Andr√© Thouin, who recommended an inventory of plants, both native and exotic, in each colony, and the development of a reciprocal exchange ‚Äì all under the control of the garden in Paris. Part of this program was the sending of outstanding horticulturists and botanists (√©l√®ve-botanists and √©l√®ve- jardiniers) on voyages of scientific exploration. * Joseph Martin (fl.1788‚Äì1826) a gardener who worked at the Jardin du Roi in Paris sent by Thouin to collect on the Ile de France, Madagascar, Cape and Caribbean. * Jean Nicolas Collignon (1762‚Äì?1788) French gardener on the French La P√©rouse expedition to the South Seas, 1785‚Äì1788, on the flagship Boussole. * Pierre- Paul Saunier (1751‚Äì1818) a French gardener who, in 1785, accompanied the botanist Andr√© Michaux to North America where he assisted in the establishment of a garden for the French crown. * F√©lix Delahaye (1767‚Äì1829) a French gardener who served on the Bruni d'Entrecasteaux expedition (1791‚Äì93) which was sent by the French National Assembly to search for the missing explorer La P√©rouse. * Anselme Riedl√© (1775‚Äì1801) A French gardener on Nicolas Baudin's scientific expedition (1800‚Äì1804) in the corvettes G√©ographe and Naturaliste to chart the coast of New Holland (Australia), make scientific observations and collect natural history specimens.

He died at sea on 15 November 1801. * Antoine Guichenot (fl. 1801‚Äì1817) a French Assistant Gardener who served on Nicolas Baudin's scientific expedition (1800‚Äì1804) in the corvettes G√©ographe and Naturaliste to chart the coast of New Holland (Australia), make scientific observations and collect natural history specimens. He was a member of a team of five gardeners that served under Head Gardener Anselme Riedl√©. He survived to serve on the 1817 voyage under Louis de Freycinet). * Fran√ßois Cagnet a French Assistant Gardener who served on Nicolas Baudin's scientific expedition (1800‚Äì1804) in the corvettes G√©ographe and Naturaliste to chart the coast of New Holland (Australia), make scientific observations and collect natural history specimens. He was a member of a team of five gardeners that served under Head Gardener Anselme Riedl√© but became ill and abandoned his ship when he landed at the Ile de France. Gardener Merlot also disembarked at the Ile de France. * George Samuel Perrottet (1793‚Äì1870) was a Swiss-born French botanist and horticulturalist from the Jardin des Plantes. In 1819-21 he was employed as a naturalist gardener on an expedition commanded by Naval Captain Pierre Henri Philibert. Perottet's duties on the journey involved collecting plants in R√©union, Java, and the Philippines for re-plantation and cultivation in Guyane. Sent by Sir Joseph Banks from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Joseph Banks, following his botanical collecting with Daniel Solander at Botany Bay and elsewhere in New Holland, had maintained a keen interest as a patron of scientific work in this region. His paid collectors were sent there at first as visiting explorers, and later as temporary or permanent residents who would return specimens to Banks or Kew. * Francis Masson (1741‚Äì1805) was a Scottish botanist and gardener, and Kew Gardens‚Äô first plant hunter; sent from Kew by the newly appointed Sir Joseph Banks he sailed with James Cook on to South Africa, landing in October 1772. He stayed until 1775 and sent back to England over 500 plant species. In 1776 he went to Madeira, Canary Islands, the Azores and the Antilles.

Plants were supplied by Hugh Ronalds, a nurseryman in Brentford. * George Caley (1770‚Äì1829) was an English botanist, horticulturist and explorer sent to New Holland in 1799 (arriving at Port Jackson in April 1800) by Banks on a salary of 15 shillings a week, to collect plants and seed for Banks and the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. * William Baxter (died c. 1836) was an English gardener who collected in Australia on behalf of English nurserymen and private individuals. From the Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh * William Milne (?-1866) was a Scottish gardener at the Edinburgh Botanic Garden who in 1852 joined the HMS Herald expedition to the southwest Pacific (1852‚Äì1856) as a botanist. The expedition visited, inter alia, Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, and Western Australia. Milne was accompanied by fellow Scots botanist John MacGillivray who left the ship early in 1855 after being dismissed as the result of a dispute with the captain Henry Denham. From the Palace of Sch√∂nbrunn in Vienna * Franz Boos (1753‚Äì1832) was an Austrian gardener at the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, Vienna, and a collector of natural history specimens for Emperor Joseph II of Austria, who reigned from 1765 to 1790.

In 2010 he gave the Gray Lectures at the University of Cambridge. In 2012 Purcell became the 98th Sather Professor at the University of California, Berkeley lecturing on 'Venal Histories: The Character, Limits, and Historical Importance of Buying and Selling in the Ancient World'.

Purcell has also held the Chaire d'excellence Pierre de Fermat at the University of Toulouse II - Le Mirail. Research Purcell has research interests in the social, economic and cultural history of Rome and the City of Rome as well as the Mediterranean Sea and its history. Purcell is known especially for his 'ecological view' of ancient history as well as his expertise in ancient Mediterranean history. The publication of his book The Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History (co-written with Peregrine Horden) was hailed as a 'notable intellectual event'.The English Historical Review Vol. 116, No. 468 (Sep. 2001), p. 900 The book's main thesis is that the Mediterranean is a region made up of micro-regions. The book argues that the Mediterranean ought to be seen in terms of the ecological lines of force linking countless small regions and micro-economies together rather than in terms of a few famous metropoleis. Purcell stresses the longues dur√©es and insists that the different themes of history, i.e. politics, culture, economy, ideas and institutions must be studied in close association. Purcell is currently concerned with expanding this work and with situating the Mediterranean in even larger contexts so as to show how ancient history can be used to answer global historical questions.

In 2000 he wrote his first book, Black Beauty, a work of non-fiction which explored Western culture's perceptions of the black image. In 2006 he became creative director at Gloria books ‚Äî publishers of high end limited edition photography collectables. Today he runs his own book publishing imprint, White Labels Books, as well as 365 Positivity, an apps start-up. Early life Ben Arogundade was born in Shepherd's Bush, west London. He is one of eight children of Yoruba Nigerian parents who emigrated to the capital in 1961. His mother was a nurse and midwife while his father was a photographer, film director and playwright who died in September 1984. His family on his mother's side come from the royal house of Owu in Abeokuta, capital of Ogun State, south west Nigeria. His grandfather was king of the region from 1949 to 1972. Arogundade attended Henry Compton School in Fulham, London. Olympic sprint champion Linford Christie was in the year above him.

The influence of this tomb seems to have been widespread throughout the Hellenistic world directly or indirectly in the construction of other royal tombs.Winter, Studies in Hellenistic architecture, p.83 According to archaeological dating in ornaments and ceramics from the monument, the mausoleum was first erected around 301 BC-281 BCRidgway, Hellenistic sculpture: The styles of ca. 331-200 BC., p.187 and has occasionally been dated earlier to 333 BC, based on the assumption that it was the tomb of the admiral Memnon of Rhodes, who in that year died in a naval encounter before Lesbos.Ridgway, Hellenistic sculpture: The styles of ca. 331-200 BC., p.30 Others who may have owned the tomb were the brothers of Memnon: Mentor of Rhodes (died 333 BC) or Menandros (died shortly after 318 BC). Based on archaeological evidence and dating, it was first erected as a royal tomb by Antigonos Monophthalmus or Lysimachus, two of the Diadochi or successors of Alexander the Great, who ruled western Asia Minor in the late fourth century BC. It was possibly inspired by the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. There is no literary evidence for the location of Antigonus's tomb. Lysimachus is known to have been buried elsewhere - in a mausoleum at Lysimachia, a city that he had founded on the Thracian Chersonese.Pausanias, 1.10.5Appian, Syr. 64 When Antiochus II died in July 246 his first wife and cousin Laodice I placed him in this mausoleum as his final resting place. Architecture and decoration The Belevi Mausoleum has only been known through published articles and discussions on individual features of the monument since the 1930s. Earlier studies on the monument‚Äôs archaeology and architecture has been premature, however recently more work has been done towards the research and conservation of the monument. The natural materials and other materials used for the construction of the mausoleum were probably sourced locally. The marbles used for the construction of the monument were probably were mined in the region of Ephesus.Forum Archaeologiae - Zeitschrift f√ºr klassische Arch√§ologie 45/XII/2007: Chemical Analysis of Inclusion Fluids ‚Äì A new method to pinpoint the origin of white marbles, illustrated at the mausoleum at Belevi, p.7 Two- thousand five-hundred cubic metres of marble has been estimated were extracted for the building of the mausoleum. Architectural fragment with decoration from Belevi Mausoleum The foundation of the mausoleum was square; each side measuring some 29.65 m, suggesting a length of 100 feet of 0.2965 m.Winter, Studies in Hellenistic architecture, p.82 The mausoleum was two stories. On the ground level there were three steps supporting the base mouldings. Each plain socle was surmounted by torus, cavetto and Lesbian cyma. Ten courses of large neatly cut ashlars, 69‚Äì88 cm high, which constituted the facing of the podium, made for a total height of 11.37 m. A low architrave, 45 cm high, and a higher Doric frieze ran around the top of the podium. The south side had a deep recess that was cut into the rock core for the burial chamber, which was placed in the centre and sealed from outside. This was done in order to conceal what was in the monument and to protect the monument from tomb raiders. The chamber to which Antiochus II was buried in was a small vestibule with a rectangular back room for his body to be put in a barrel-vault. There was an unfinished false door on the north side of the structure. The top storey had 3 steps measuring 1.12 m high. The top slope served as a stylobate for a Corinthian Peristalsis, with eight columns on each side. The roof had flat marble tiles. Belevi Mausoleum The excavators of the tomb restored on each side. Around the edge of the roof, were groups of Lion-Griffins figures facing large stone vases. Pairs of horses were placed at the corners. Little has survived from the mausoleum‚Äôs roof. Antiochus II‚Äôs mausoleum may have been a step pyramid with a crowning finial on top. The blocks of the outer architrave bore this Greek inscription: :ŒóŒõŒôŒëŒîŒïŒ£ ŒñŒïŒ•Œ£ Œ¶ŒëŒïŒîŒ©Œù ŒëŒ¶Œ°ŒüŒîŒôŒ§Œó :Heliades Zeus Phaedon Aphrodite There could have been fragments of small- scale palm leaf capital with fluted Doric drum fragments. These parts could have decorated the scheme of the interior. The ceiling was embellished with large coffers. The coffers were painted intensively and adorn with panels on the ceiling. The panels facing north represented funeral games with the reliefs of the other sides dealt with a centauromachy. The burial chamber was the central part of the mausoleum. In it was a large unfinished sarcophagus with a reclining beardless male figure on top. The male figure was formerly crowned with a wreath and held a bowl in its right hand which formed together with standing statue of an oriental servant. The oriental servant characterized by his posture and clothes may have been a royal Persian servant or a page representing a banquet scene.Forum Archaeologiae - Zeitschrift f√ºr klassische Arch√§ologie 45/XII/2007: Chemical Analysis of Inclusion Fluids ‚Äì A new method to pinpoint the origin of white marbles, illustrated at the mausoleum at Belevi, p.3 Sculptures and architectural pieces found at the monument still bear remains of their painted finish. The frequent painting replaced carving on the architectural mouldings was a practice reminiscent of Macedonian architecture. The work of the mausoleum was never finished. If the monument was completed, it could have reached a height of about 35 m. When Lysimachus first erected the monument, the construction of his mausoleum had been interrupted because he died in battle. When Antiochus II died, Laodice I added in addition architectural and sculptural elements for the monument. In 244 BC, Ephesus and the surrounding region came under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty. The period that Laodice I spent on further work on her husband‚Äôs mausoleum was brief. The architectural dimensions and designs of the elaborate decorations have Greek and Persian elements. The high square podium with the pyramid on top is non-Greek. Persian influences are strong with some of the sculptural decorations such as the statue of the servant, the roof long-winged Lion-Griffin figures (symbols of the Persian Kings) and the vases. The Griffins and a centauromachy mean the battle between Centaur and Humans. This was a very common theme, which represents the victory of civilization over barbarism. The way the tomb chamber has been erected was Macedonian. Antiochus II was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. The life sized statues of the Lion-Griffin figures are on display at the museums at Izmir and Ephesus. The sarcophagus of Antiochus II is on display at the museum at Sel√ßuk together with two Lions. Fragments of the coffers depicting funeral games and the centauromachy are on display at the museums at Sel√ßuk and Izmir. The human figures, horses and large urns are on display at the museums at Sel√ßuk and Izmir.

Early life  Anderson was born in Glasgow. His father Stan was a civil engineer and his mother Anne, an artist. He discovered photography and the sea at a young age. During annual trips to the family home in Lamlash, on the Isle of Arran, Anderson quickly became a confident snorkeler and free diver. At the age of 11 he borrowed a Nikonas Mark 3 camera from his father and took his first images of a lion's mane jellyfish just off the \\"Old Pier\\" in Lamlash bay.  Career  Anderson studied Marine Biology at St Andrews University, Scotland. After graduation he spent five years as a commercial scallop diver on the Scottish west coast. To pursue a career in wildlife photography, in 1996, Anderson moved to Bristol, home of the BBC Natural History Unit. In 1999, after four years of camera assisting, Anderson shot his first \\"Blue Chip\\" Wildlife sequence for a BBC's The Blue Planet series. The sequence was of an alleged 15 m (49 ft) Sei whale (two later papers identified it as a Bryde's whale) feeding on a small bait ball of the Pacific side of Mexico. Anderson has been involved in the principal photography on BBC/Discovery Channel productions The Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Life, and Frozen Planet as well as many other wildlife programmes.

It is located on the Neuer Wildenstein, a 337 m high rock outcrop in the hinterland of Saxon Switzerland, south of the Lichtenhain Waterfall and above the Kirnitzsch valley. It is crowned by the 15th-century castle of Wildenstein. The arch is 11 metres high, 17 metres wide and 24 metres deep.  Name  The name Kuhstall has two possible origins. The first posit is that the local population hid their cattle in the very wide natural archway from marauding Swedish soldiers during the Thirty Years' War. The second is that the occupants of the medieval castle, that towards the end became a haven for robber knights, kept the cattle here that they had stolen during their raids. The first developer of Saxon Switzerland, Wilhelm Lebrecht G√∂tzinger, suggested that the natural arch should be called the Wildenstein Rock Hall (Wildensteiner Felsenhalle) instead of the traditional and folksy Kuhstall, but was not able to prevail. From the time when the area was first developed for tourism, there are many old inscriptions, that have been written on the walls and roof of the Kuhstall with soot and paint or scratched into the rock.  Geology  The rock fenster lies on a clay-containing, intermediate layer. On the boundary walls is smooth polished, petrified rock. The cause was tectonic movements of the Lusatian Fault, about 900 metres away; here during the Cretaceous era, the older granite was pushed over the younger sandstones. The rock massif has numerous caves and overhangs, some with legendary names like Schneiderloch and Wochenbett.  Tourism  In the early 19th century the Kuhstall developed into one of the main attractions of Saxon Switzerland. It was an important station along the Artists' Way (Malerweg). August von Goethe visited the rocks in June 1819 and reported: \\"a friendly hospitality with beer, strawberries, lemonade and rum made this spot a place of rest for the hungry and tired body.\\"Gotthold Sobe: Die Reise August von Goethes 1819 in die S√§chsische Schweiz. in: S√§chsische Heimatbl√§tter 16(1970)1, p. 43 Since 1824 there has been a mountain inn by the rock arch that has been rebuilt and extended several times. With the opening of the Kirnitzschtal Tramway to the Lichtenhain Waterfall in 1898 the Kuhstall has been even more accessible. In 1837 Helmina von Chezy made an entry in the guest book at the Kuhstall whilst on holiday which translates loosely as follows: \\"Here, where beautiful nature enchants and enthralls us, terrible jokes are scrawled that appal us.\\" And reaps a reply along the lines of: \\"Aye, Mrs von Chezy, with her verses so sleazy. Ad. v. Th., 27 July 1837.\\"Moritz Gottlieb Saphir (Hrsg.): Conversations-Lexikon f√ºr Geist, Witz und Humor. Dresden 1952, Vol. 1, p. 280. Even today the Kuhstall is a popular family destination. From the observation terrace south of the arch the climbing areas of the hinter Saxon Switzerland are visible over a wide panorama. Above the Kuhstall are the ruins of the former castle, accessible through the narrow rock tunnel of the Himmelsleiter. On Bohemian engraved glass the Kuhstall is one of the most popular motifs of Saxon Switzerland.

It began after a 39-year- old resident of the suburb, later identified as Donato Anthony Corbo, entered his neighbours' property and shot four people, killing three and severely wounding one. An eight-hour stand-off with police followed, during which time he shot and wounded two officers. The stand-off culminated in his arrest by members of the Special Tasks and Rescue unit of South Australia Police. Events The incident started at approximately 2:30 a.m. when Corbo entered his neighbours' property and shot dead the 64-year-old man, then his 65-year- old wife and their 41-year-old son-in-law. A female who was also in the house at the time rang police and fled with her 14-year-old son and his 11-year-old friend, but the son was seriously wounded when Corbo shot him as he tried to flee the house. A South Australia Police patrol were the first officers on the scene. It is alleged that when the officers approached the house, Corbo opened fire with a shotgun. One officer was seriously wounded when he was shot in the face and another officer was wounded in the knee, but was able to return fire and drag himself and his wounded colleague to safety. Both officers were taken to Royal Adelaide Hospital for treatment and survived. Corbo then fled next door back to his property, where he engaged in a tense siege with heavily armed members of the STAR force. After an eight-hour-long siege, police finally entered the property and arrested Corbo without further casualties. Victims The victims were South African immigrants who arrived in Australia three years before the shooting from Pretoria in the hope of a better life for their son as they felt that South Africa was a violent place to bring a child up. The two deceased victims were on holiday visiting the family and were due to return home to South Africa two days after the shooting took place. The family were deeply religious, members of the local Seventh-day Adventist Church. Suspect The suspect arrested was announced as being 39-year-old Donato Anthony Corbo, and had had previous dealings with the police. It is suggested that the reason for the killings may have sparked from an earlier row between the two families over Corbo's pet dog, a Staffordshire Terrier, which had recently been poisoned. It is also speculated that Corbo was suffering from mental health issues, stemming from a relationship breakup in December 2010. It is alleged that the weapon used during the shootings was a shotgun, a Class-A category firearm. It is not known if Corbo has a legitimate licence for the weapon. However, police would later remove three further firearms from his property. Aftermath Corbo was later charged with three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, and a string of other offences, and if convicted, he would face an automatic penalty of three consecutive sentences of life imprisonment. He was refused bail and scheduled to appear in court on 2 May. A day after the shootings occurred, the police officer who was seriously wounded after being shot in the face was confirmed to be in a serious but stable condition, under an induced coma in Royal Adelaide Hospital. The 14-year-old boy who also suffered gunshot wounds was also stated to be in a similar condition. Corbo appeared in Adelaide Magistrates Court on 2 May, charged with three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was scheduled to reappear in court on 26 July. On 17 May 2012, Justice Michael David found Corbo not guilty due to mental incompetence of the murders of Luc Mombers, 41, and his parents-in-law Kobus, 64, and Annetjie Snyman, 65; the attempted murders of Mr Mombers' 14-year-old son Marcel and a police officer; and threatening a second police officer with a firearm. Corbo was automatically sentenced to three consecutive sentences of detention in hospital for life.Hectorville gunman Donato Anthony Corbo will spend the rest of his life in mental health detention The matter was remanded until 21 June, when Justice David was to decide whether Corbo should ever be released under supervision. On 16 May 2013, the final decision was made that Corbo would spend the rest of his life in mental health detention.Murderpedia ReferencesSee also * Timeline of major crimes in Australia * Crime in Australia * Crime in South Australia Category:2011 crimes in Australia Category:2010s in Adelaide Category:Crime in Adelaide Category:History of Australia since 1945 Category:Hostage taking in Australia Category:2011 murders in Oceania Category:Murder in South Australia Category:2010s murders in Australia ","title":"2011 Hectorville siege"},{"id":"31627986","text":"Beli Griƒç (; Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

Gibson was born in Durban in 1888, the daughter of Otto Siedle, a prominent local shipping agent, businessman and musician of German extraction. In the early twentieth century she studied music and art in Europe and the US, and gave recitals in London and New York. Her youngest brother was Jack Siedle, the South African Test cricketer. During World War 2 Durban was an extremely busy waystation for convoys of ships en route to the fronts in North Africa and the Far East. Gibson became famous among thousands of Allied troops when she serenaded them as their ships passed in and out. One account of the origin for Gibson's custom was that it arose when she was seeing off a young Irish seaman her family had entertained the day before. As his ship was departing he was said to have called across the water asking her to sing something Irish, and Gibson responded with a rendition of \\"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\\". She decided to sing to every ship connected with the war which entered or left the harbour. Over the following years she went on to sing to more than 5,000 ships and a total of about a quarter of a million Allied servicemen. Clad in white with a red hat, she would stand at a spot at the mouth of Durban Bay where ships entering and leaving the harbour pass quite close, and sing patriotic and sentimental songs through a megaphone from a torpedoed ship, which grateful British soldiers had given her. Soldiers' talk led to the fame of the Lady in White spreading around the world. A British army newspaper called Parade, dated 3 March 1945, described Gibson as a highlight of troops' visits to Durban: Gibson was married to Air Sergeant Jack Gibson, who served in Italy, and had two sons and a daughter in the military. She had sung all their ships goodbye as they left for the war. She even sang on the day she received news that her son Roy had been killed in the fighting in Italy. She died in 1971, shortly before her 83rd birthday. The year later a bronze plaque donated by men of the Royal Navy was erected to her memory on Durban's North Pier on the spot where she used to sing. In 1995 Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a statue of Gibson near the Ocean Terminal in Durban harbour. The statue of Perla Gibson was re-located to the Port Natal / Durban Maritime Museum on 27 September 2016 NotesBibliography *Berman, E: Art & Artists of South Africa. Southern Book Publishers, 1994.

Phantom OS is based on a concept of persistent virtual memory, and is managed-code oriented. Phantom OS is one of a few OSes that are not based on classical concepts of Unix-like systems. Its primary goal is to achieve simplicity and effectiveness in both the operating system and applications at the same time. Phantom is based on the principle that \\"Everything is an object\\", in contrast to the Unix-like approach of \\"Everything is a file\\".  Basics  Managed code: Memory protection on object level, rather than on process level; absence of pointer arithmetic in managed code avoids many problems that are present in unmanaged code. Global address space: Very effective and inexpensive IPC (InterProcess Communication). Single (flat) address space allows transfer of objects from one process (application) to another by transferring links to that object. Security is achieved through the absence of pointer arithmetic and the inability of an application to get linked to an object other than by calling a public method. Persistence: Application code does not see OS restarts and could live forever‚Äîthis makes the concept of a file obsolete and any variable or data structure could be stored forever and at the same time be available directly through a pointer. Differently from hibernation that is done in other OSs, persistence lies in the very core principles of the Phantom OS core. It is done transparently for applications; in most cases it does not require re-programming of an application. Persistence stays even if the computer crashes.  Compatibility  Two ways of code migration are offered: * Converter from JVM bytecode ‚Äî will supposedly allow import of Java bytecode and other programming languages targeting Java virtual machine. * POSIX- subsystem allows port of application code from Unix/Linux ‚Äî although important features of Phantom OS will not be available.  Status  Currently the system exists in alpha version for ia32 processors. Port to ARM architecture is underway (currently being tested, not yet ready for use) and port to MIPS and amd64 has been started. Kernel operation has been demonstrated at the biggest Russian IT-conferences RIT 2011, ADD 2010,Dmitry Zavalishin reports on ADD 2010 CC 2010,Dmitry Zavalishin reports on Chaos Constructions‚Äô2010 (Saint-Petersburg, Russia) and 2009.

EW-MFA are descriptive statistics, in physical units such as tonnes per year. EW-MFA is consistent with the principles and system boundaries of the System of National Accounts (SNA) and follows the residence principle.EC, IMF, OECD, UN & World Bank ‚ÄúSystem of National Accounts 2008‚Äù. European Commission, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, United Nations and World Bank, New York, Dec. 2009, 1993, lvi + 662 pp. This means that EW-MFA is also a part of the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA).Handbook of National Accounting System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting 2003, UN, EC, IMF, OECD and World Bank \\"System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting\\" , United Nations, European Commission, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and World Bank 2003, 598 pp.  Scope  The underlying definition of economy-wide material flow accounts includes statistics on the overall material inputs into national economies, the changes of material stock within the economic system and the material outputs to other economies or to the environment. Statistics on EW-MFA cover all solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, except for water and air. However, water in products is included. EW-MFA includes statistics on material flows crossing the national (geographical) border, i.e. imports and exports.Eurostat \\"Economy Wide Material Flow Accounts: Compilation Guidelines for reporting to the 2009 Eurostat questionnaire\\" , Eurostat, 125 pp. EW-MFA strives to produce a mass balance of material flows. It systematically categorises material input and output flows crossing the functional border between economy (technosphere, anthroposphere) and environment. Mass balances are defined as \\"...on the first law of thermodynamics (called the law of conservation of matter), which states that matter (mass, energy) is neither created nor destroyed by any physical process\\".OECD \\" Economy-wide MFA (EMFA)\\", OECD, 164 pp. Interpreting the statistics In principle, the statistics will show which countries are dependent on others for natural resources and which are major exporters of natural resources. The statistics also show if a countries production is sustainable, i.e. whether the economy of a country can produce more products using fewer natural resources. In the European Union between 2000 and 2007, resource productivity increased by almost eight percent.\\"Eurostat MFA explained\\". Resource productivity of the EU is expressed by the amount of gross domestic product (GDP) generated per unit of material consumed (Domestic Material Consumption, see below), in other words GDP / DMC in euro per kg. This means that less material was consumed in order to produce the same amount of products in the EU. However, breaking down the components of the index it is seen that both GDP and DMC are increasing, only not equally fast.  History  When the European Council met in Helsinki in December 1999, part of the agenda was dedicated to establishing an understanding of how economies are dependent on the use of natural resources and that these resources are not in limitless supply.Eurostat \\"Material use indicators for the European Union, 1980‚Äì1997 No. 2/2001/B/2\\". Wuppertal Institute, Stefan Bringezu and Helmut Sch√ºtz, Luxembourg, March. 2011, 109 pp. The following year, Eurostat, together with the Wuppertal Institute and national statistical offices in Europe, developed the first statistical guideline for how to compile statistics and subsequent indicators on material flows.  Implementation  There is a link between the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) and EW-MFA. Statistics are based on the same principles (the residence principle of the SNA) and thus become the EW-MFA a sub-component of the SEEA. The EW-MFA links the environment to the economy through the flows of materials extracted, processed and traded. Compiling the statistics The only international data collection on EW- MFA is conducted through Eurostat. In 2011 the European Council and European Parliament passed a statistical regulation for the compilation of annual statistics on material flows.Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2011 on European environmental economic accounts, Official Journal of the European Union L 192 Volume 54 22 July 2011, \\"Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2011 on European environmental economic accounts\\", Official Journal of the European Union, EUR-LEX, L 192 Volume 54 22 July 2011. Most European statistical offices compile the statistics on EW-MFA through the use of existing statistics. Trade statistics, some agricultural statistics and other sources are used in combination to create EW-MFA statistics. Compiling the indicators The statistics on EW-MFA are usually combined in order to create indicators. The definitions explained below are extracted from the work of Eurostat and are applied by the national statistical officies who are following the framework of EW-MFA. * Input side: DE, DMC, and DMI * Output side: DPO Direct material consumption (DMC) is defined as the total amount of material directly used in an economy, i.e. it equals domestic extraction plus imports minus exports. DMC does not include upstream hidden flows related to imports and exports of raw materials and products.Eurostat ‚ÄúEconomy-wide material flows, Statistics in Focus 9/2011‚Äù . Eurostat, Hass, J., Popescu, C., Luxembourg, March. 2011, 8 pp. Domestic material input (DMI) summarizes domestic extraction of resources and the imports, i.e. all materials which are of economic value and are used in production and consumption activities, except balancing items. DMI is not additive across countries. Due to the inclusion of trade within the EU double counting would occur if one would add several countries together. Physical trade balance (PTB) equals physical imports minus physical exports. This means that in relation to monetary trade balances which is exports minus imports) the flows are the reverse. It measures the fact that in economies money and goods move in opposite direction. A physical trade surplus indicates a net import of materials, whereas a physical trade deficit indicates a net export. Net additions to stock (NAS) measures the ‚Äòphysical growth of the economy‚Äô, i.e. the quantity (weight) of new construction materials used in buildings and other infrastructure, and materials incorporated into new durable goods such as cars, industrial machinery, and household appliances. Materials are added to the economy‚Äôs stock each year (gross additions), and old materials are removed from stock as buildings are demolished, and durable goods. Domestic processed output (DPO) measures the total weight of materials which are released back to the environment after having been used in the domestic economy. These flows occur at the processing, manufacturing, use, and final disposal stages of the production-consumption chain. Included in DPO are emissions to air, industrial and household wastes deposited in controlled and uncontrolled landfills, material loads in wastewater and materials dispersed into the environment as a result of product use (dissipative flows). Recycled material flows in the economy (e.g. of metals, paper, glass) are not included in DPO.
