Located southwest of downtown, the interchange links Autoroutes 15 (D√©carie and D√©carie South Expressways), 20 (Remembrance Highway), and 720 (Ville-Marie Expressway), and provides access to the Champlain Bridge via the D√©carie South Expressway. It takes its name from the nearby Philippe-Turcot Street and Turcot village, which were in turn named after Philippe Turcot (1791-1861) who was a merchant owning land in Saint-Henri. Turcot is the largest interchange in the province and the third busiest interchange of Montreal (after D√©carie and Anjou Interchanges, respectively) as of 2010, with numbers averaging a north-southbound flow of 278,000 approximate daily drivers, and over 350,000 west-eastbound in total. Moreover, Turcot is an occasional spot for road accidents, as speed is limited to only on any of the interchange's directions, and the limit is often disregarded by the night drivers going over . The interchange has been undergoing an extensive reconstruction since 2015 and is expected to be completed by fall 2020. The $3.7-billion project is the largest roadwork in the province's history.  History  The interchange was projected as part of the first Montreal highway in 1958 and planned to bind it to the D√©carie Expressway, which was also designed at the same time. Construction started in October 1965 and Turcot was built in time for the 1967 Montreal Expo, along with other big projects such as the Montreal Metro. Upon its erection, an old railroad yard belonging to the Grand Trunk Company (today merged into Canadian National) served as location for the interchange and was shortened by 25%, which required the demolition of a roundhouse. In 1969, upon reviewing the situation, city authorities concluded that the project used unnecessary space and could have co-existed perfectly alongside the buildings that were otherwise demolished, including some 20 residences. The elevated lanes of the Turcot Interchange When it was originally constructed, nearly the entire interchange was built high above the ground because of the cliff existing between the Upper Lachine domain and the Turcot sorting yard overtaking the old Saint-Pierre Lake basin. The highest point of the interchange () is located in its southern part over the Lachine Canal to allow for the passing of ships, but the canal closed its waterway operations just three years later, in 1970. The mean height of the interchange is around , which was, at the time of its inauguration, both the highest freeway interchange in all of Canada and a dramatic demonstration of Montreal's status as a modern global metropolis at the time. The construction of the junction was said to be rushed during the 1960s boom, with a lack of drainage and permeable concrete, and deteriorated, with pieces of concrete slabs falling from overpass structures. In 2000, more than 300,000 vehicles used the interchange every day, far more than the 50,000-60,000 vehicles that it had been designed to carry. Since 2010, the interchange became subject to major repairs of the most heavily accessed ramps. During the summer of 2011, over 2.7 km worth of lanes were restored, repaved, and returned to safely accessible condition for larger vehicles.  Reconstruction  Underside of the various overpasses comprising the Turcot Interchange. In June 2007, the Quebec government announced the demolition and reconstruction of the structure, which was projected to be complete in 2016. The announcement came four years after a study on the interchange showed the Turcot structure was crumbling, with reports of concrete slabs up to one square metre falling from the overpasses. In addition to a new interchange built lower to the ground, a large segment of Autoroute 20 would be rebuilt more to the north. Reconstruction of the interchange is expected to cost between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion.  Controversy  At the time of its announcement, the project created controversy as to how Turcot should be rebuilt. Local residents and community groups have come out against the project as proposed by the government, claiming that it will worsen pollution, increase automobile traffic downtown, and require the demolition of housing including a significant portion of the Village des Tanneries neighbourhood. The project's environmental hearings ended on June 19, 2009. They revealed new plans for the area by CN, as well as strong public desire to protect existing communities, rethink the modal balance of Montreal's urban transportation, and plan realistically for a future of energy shortages and environmental crisis. After MDDEP conducted several environmental and technical impact investigations in early Summer of 2009, construction plans were halted because of the 2009 financial crisis.  Second project  In April 2010, the city of Montreal gathered all previous commentary reviewed by BAPE and announced a different reconstruction project in which the railroad tracks and the main body of the A-20 are kept at their original location, the height of the interchange is maintained but replaced with better-lasting materials, and the former Turcot Yards serve as ground for a new urban redevelopment district with its own community aspect. The cost as set at least $5 billion, which is at least three times that of the original. \\"If this project is to replace the original,\\" stated Julie Boulet, \\"we can expect at least two more years of stalling,\\" and suggested that Turcot should not be seen as a sandbox for any kind of proposals coming from all levels of the government. According to Gerald Tremblay, former mayor of Montreal, that was exactly the time necessary to prepare for the works, which were postponed into the second half of 2012. Groundbreaking and Angrignon exit reconfiguration Starting February 2012, the MTQ proceeded to hire excavation companies in order to start the ground leveling of the former yards in terms of the future project. The westbound lanes of the A-20 were to be moved to that location, and Boulet confirmed that the reconfiguration of the Ste-Anne-de- Bellevue‚ÄîPullman‚ÄîAngrignon interchange would take place and that it was scheduled to be completed in 2018. Just as foreseen in the project, the part of the Angrignon Boulevard used as an exit overpass from the A-20 will be moved some 300 m westward, forming the second half of the Sainte-Anne-de- Bellevue Boulevard intersection. The original part of Pullman Street, between Angrignon and Sainte-Anne, simply ceased to exist. As of April 2014, the works could be seen to be underway near the interchange itself, and some existing streets/exits/entrances (Girouard, Crowley (after the CUSM completion), C√¥te- Saint-Paul, Angrignon/Pullman) had been reconfigured to accept the new flow once the body of the A-20 was moved northward. Completion (2015-2020) The reconfiguration and reconstruction of the interchange commenced in 2015 and is expected to be completed by fall 2020. In October 2016, much of the old interchange was closed, allowing continuous work on the new interchange. The $3.7-billion project is the largest roadwork in the province's history.  In popular culture  Famous Quebec folk singer Plume Latraverse, beacon of the late 1960s counterculture and key figure at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, compared Turcot to the \\"functional heart\\" of the city, with its inward ramps being the arteries and outward ramps being the veins in the lyrics of one of his late 1970s songs. Turcot was the setting for writer-director Ren√© Balcer's 1978 short film Turcot Interchange, a dark rom-com. Since late 1990s, the abandoned space underneath the ramps has become a place of urban gatherings for certain graffiti artists. The artistic trio \\"Flow\\", which was also rooted in Montreal in 1993 and has long ever since moved on, is involved in producing one of the paintings on the westbound A-20 ramp, \\"Smashing All Toys.\\" With criminal activity on the rise in Saint-Henri in the first half of the 2000s, this space has also been high on drug dealers and violence gangs until they were cleared by the SPVM by 2010. Today, the area is used as a park by many local residents, who claim that because of the height of the ramps, there is almost no pollution from the passing cars.

History The hospital was conceived and supported by the Dhulikhel community, as a health service provider. The hospital was inaugurated by the late king Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev in 1996, as a collaborative project of the Dhulikhel Municipality, NepaliMed and Dhulikhel Health Service Association. The hospital was started to provide outpatient service, 24 hours emergency, inpatient from beginning. Dr. Ram KM Shrestha and Dr. Rajendra Koju were 2 doctors to start the affordable health care services from this hospital. Service area Dhulikhel Hospital new building The hospital covers a population of 2.7 million people from Bhaktapur, Dolakha, Kavrepalanchowk, Ramechhap, Sindhupalchok, Sindhuli and other districts. Dhulikhel Hospital has provided services to people from more than 50 out of 75 districts of the country. About 2.7 million people from Kavrepalanchowk, Sindhupalchowk, Bhaktapur, Dolakha, Ramechhap, Sindhuli, Kathmandu, Lalitpur and surrounding districts are served in a year. There are significant number of cases referred from different parts of the country. Since opening of Banepa Bardibas highway connecting eastern Terai, the number of patients from Terain region has significantly increased. University Hospital Dhulikhel hospital is also the university hospital for all the medical programs run under the collaboration with Kathmandu University (constituent medical programs of Kathmandu University). Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences is running MBBS, BDS, BSc. Nursing, BNS, BPT, MD/MS in different specialties in this hospital.http://www.dhulikhelhospital.org/index.php/2013-03-24-04-24-34/introduction Community Health=Department of Community Programs The department has expanded since 1996. It now works as a coordinating unit between the hospital‚Äôs various medical departments and numerous rural communities that previously had no access to immediate healthcare facilities. The department attempts to address health issues in remote areas through a holistic approach; quality service delivery; rational community-based methods; innovative public health interventions; and effective partnership programs. It aims to implement these measures and services through rigorous monitoring and evaluation methods, in order to ensure that its main objective, to act as a coordinating unit for other departments in the hospital, is successfully carried out. Currently, the work of the Department of Community Programmes can be categorised as the following: * Health Service Programmes * Public Health Programmes * Partnership Programmes * Global Health Programmes Majority of the work of the Department of Community Programs is carried out by the outreach centers. At the 14 outreach centers and one school health clinic round-the- clock healthcare services are provided to the people living in the catchment areas. All of these outreach centers were started after thorough discussions and meetings addressing the community directly about their needs, aims, and goals concerning healthcare. The outreaches not only provide basic health services, but also a platform on which all the community programs begin. Many preventive, promotive and curative services are provided to all outreach rural communities. Various NGOs and INGOs also provide services to the community at grassroots level through the outreach centers. Outreach Centres Kavrepalanchok District = # Baluwa Health Centre # Bolde Health Centre # Dapcha Health Centre # Kattike Deurali Health Centre # Salambu Health Centre # Dhungkharka Health Centre =Sindhupalchok District= #Bahunepati Health Centre #Hindi Health Centre #Manekharka Health Centre #Lamosangu Temporary Basic Health Care Unit #Yangrima School Health Clinic =Dhading District= #Chattre Deurali Health Centre =Lalitpur District= #Godamchaur Health Centre =Solukhumbu District= #Kharikhola Health Centre #Dorpu Health Centre =Dolakha District= #Kirnetar Health Centre #Gaurishankar Community General Hospital =Parbat District= #Phalebas Health Center =Nuwakot District= #Thansing Health Center =Sindhuli District= #Dumja Health Center Services Dhulikhel Hospital ensures that all paramedical staff at the outreach centers receive regular training and are on- call 24 hours a day in case of emergencies. Regular doctor visits are scheduled to the outreach centers. These centers are also used as a means of providing higher level specialized care. In 2011-2012 year alone we organized 244 specialized camps in the following areas in different rural areas of Nepal: * General Surgery * Ophthalmology * Cardiology * Gastroenterology * Obstetrics & Gynecology * Orthopedic * Urosurgery * Psychiatry * Physiotherapy * Paediatrics * Otolaryngology ENT * Dermatology * Dentistry Dental * Gynecology * Urosurgery * Vascular surgery At Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital, outreach placements are a part of all the medical and paramedical students‚Äô studies, which encourages them to be actively involved in community healthcare. In the past, students have stayed at various outreach centers for a maximum of two weeks where they have been on-hand to cater to the needs of patients 24 hours a day. Partnership Programs In addition to training the hospital's own staff at the Outreach Centes, training courses for health personnel from government health centres are also conducted. The partnership work covers other areas of Nepal. Technical assistance is provided to eight hospitals all over the Nepal. The partners include: # Ampipal Hospital, Gorkha District # Tamakoshi Cooperative Hospital, Ramechhap District # Dolpa Health Centre, Dolpa District # Sahaj Community Hospital, Nawalparasi District # Poyan Health Centre, Solukhumbhu District # Phalebas Health Centre, Parbat District # Necha Health Centre, Okhaldhunga District # Bayalpata Hospital, Achham District Public Health Programs Through the Department of Community Programs, the staff at the Dhulikhel Hospital coordinate many [public health] programs designed to uplift communities by improving their standard of living. Various public health programs have been conducted: plantation programs around schools and villages; first aid training; hygiene and sanitation teaching for school children; awareness programs for women (for issues like cervical cancer, breast cancer, uterine prolapse); and mental health awareness programs for both women and school children. Current Public Health Programs include: #Plantation Programs and Community Forestry #Micro- Finance Programs #Micro-Insurance Programs #Women's Awareness Programs #School Health Programs #Occupational Health Programs #Improved Cooking Stoves Construction = Plantation Programs and Community Forestry = Plantation programs is one of the Department of Community Programs‚Äô newest initiatives. The program raises awareness on deforestation and climate change in the rural communities and incorporates awareness campaigns into local school curricula. Thus far, two schools have been involved and more than 1,005 trees have been planted. =Micro-Finance Programs= The Micro-Finance program was in 2008 at the Bahunepati Health Centre. Today, Dhulikhel Hospital has 31 micro- finance groups in five outreach centers (Bahunepati, Kattike Deurali, Dapcha, Solombhu, Baluwa). The micro-finance programs were created to financially assist women in rural communities. Each micro-finance group consists of 10 women with a nominated leader from their own community, who ensures that the loan is paid back in monthly installments, with an additional four percent interest rate. The interest in turn generates a sum of money for another woman to join the group. The women from the micro-finance groups have gone on to purchase animals for livestock farming such as pigs, goats, and chickens; or have invested in materials to start their own small businesses like candle- making. To date, over 300 women have benefited from the program. =Micro- insurance Programs= Micro-insurance Programs were launched at the end of 2010. For just 50 rupees per month, the Micro-insurance Program has ensured that all the women involved in the micro-finance programs and their children are covered for basic medical healthcare. =Women's Awareness Programs= The staff from the Department of Community Programs and the Gynaecology/Obstetrics department work together within the outreach centers to find out the needs of women and how they can be helped. In 2011-2012 a total of 29,681 women from different rural vicinities were involved in the Awareness Programs. The major topics discussed were: cervical cancer, uterine prolapse, breast cancer, menstural hygiene, and tuberculosis. The Department of Community Programs is also raising awareness on teenage pregnancies, dysmenorrhoea, family planning, and sexually transmitted infections. Dhulikhel Hospital operates on all uterine prolapse cases without charge. Due to societal restrictions many women in rural areas do not talk about their cases and cases often come to the hospital with stage three uterine prolapse. Since 2008, the department has specifically recruited nurses from the hospital for awareness programs on uterine prolapse in the outreach centers. =School Health Programs= This program through education highlights the importance of hygiene and healthcare for school children and teachers. The School Health Programs are focused on encouraging education on topics such as hygiene, toilet use, and first aid. Working with the District Government Office, Adolescent Health Programs and extra-curricular School Health Clubs have been formed. Furthermore, first aid trainings have been provided for teachers from 11 schools in cooperation with local governmental health center staff. Between 2011 and 2012 the re were 72 various health programs at 120 different schools. 10,9384 students were screened for dental, ENT, ophthalmic problems. =Occupational Health Programs= Farmers in Nepal face severe health risks due to their heavy use of pesticides in crop farming. The Department of Community Programs is conducting awareness programs targeting these farmers, with regards to the proper use of pesticides in crop farming. The program aims to first raise the issue of pesticides as a health hazard amongst farmers and their families, and then tackle the increasingly widespread and improper use of pesticides.

County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218 (1964), is a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that the County School Board of Prince Edward County, Virginia's decision to close all local, public schools and provide vouchers to attend private schools were constitutionally impermissible as violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..  Background  In response to the court's holding in Brown v. Board of Education, Virginia initiated a coordinated policy known as massive resistance to maintain segregationist policies. A legislative package known as the Stanley Plan was enacted. Numerous public schools had been closed through the tactics of massive resistance. However, when the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors was ordered to integrate the public schools under its jurisdiction in June 1959, it took the unusual and extreme step of not appropriating any money for the school system, forcing all public schools in the county to close for the next five years.Griffin, 377 U.S. at 223. Instead of funding public schools, Prince Edward County provided tuition grants for all students, regardless of their race, to use for private nonsectarian education.Griffin, 377 U.S. at 224. No private schools existed for blacks, resulting in the total deprivation of formal education to black children in the county from 1959 to 1963. All private schools in the region remained racially segregated. A private foundation proposed opening a private school for black children, but the offer was rejected in part because many of the black residents of Prince Edward County wanted \\"to continue the legal battle for desegregated public schools.\\" In 1963, \\"federal, state, and county authorities cooperated to have classes conducted for Negroes and whites in school buildings owned by the county,\\" but the county-funded schools remained closed until the Supreme Court's 1964 ruling on the litigation arising from the county's 1959 closure of the schools. In 1959, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had ordered the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to require that the schools open without segregation. The District Court initially refrained from ordering the schools opened pending the separate question whether the Virginia state constitution required the operation of public schools.Griffin v. Board of Supervisors of Prince Edward County, 203 Va. 321, 124 S. E. 2d 227 (1962). In 1962, the District Court ordered the county board to fund the schools.Griffin, 377 U.S. at 224-25. The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court should have awaited the state law determinations of whether the county was required to operate schools.Griffin, 377 U.S. at 225. The black schoolchildren appealed to the Supreme Court. The case was argued by Robert L. Carter for the NAACP (Samuel W. Tucker and Frank D. Reeves on the brief); Virginia assistant attorney general R.D. McIlvaine (Attorney General Robert Young Button and Assistant Attorney General Frederick Thomas Gray on the brief) and Judge John Segar Gravatt for the school board, and Solicitor General Archibald Cox argued on behalf of the United States as an amicus curiae, urging reversal. Decision Draft of first page of decision The Supreme Court, in a decision authored by Justice Hugo Black, ordered the schools reopened. It held that the supervisors' action of refusing to fund the public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, where the county offered only private school vouchers for students and where no private schools accepted black students. This case marked the first time that the Supreme Court ordered a county government to exercise their power of taxation. This unusual level of intervention in the function of local government provoked a dissent by Justices Clark and Harlan: See also * Davis v.

Another aspect of the relationship between religion and geography is religious geography, in which geographical ideas are influenced by religion, such as early map-making, and the biblical geography that developed in the 16th century to identify places from the Bible. Research traditions Traditionally, the relationship between geography and religion can clearly be seen by the influences of religion in shaping cosmological understandings of the world. From the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the study of geography and religion mainly focused on mapping the spread of Christianity (termed ecclesiastical geography by Issac 1965), though in the later half of the seventeenth century, the influences and spread of other religions were also taken into account. Other traditional approaches to the study of the relationship between geography and religion involved the theological explorations of the workings of Nature ‚Äì a highly environmentally deterministic approach which identified the role of geographical environments in determining the nature and evolution of different religious traditions. Thus, geographers are less concerned about religion per se, but are more sensitive to how religion as a cultural feature affects social, cultural, political and environmental systems. The point of focus is not the specifics of religious beliefs and practices, but how these religious beliefs and practices are internalised by adherents, and how these processes of internalization influence, and is influenced by, social systems. Sacred places Traditional cultural geographical approaches to the study of religion mainly seek to determine religion‚Äôs impact on the landscape. A more contemporary approach to the study of the intersections of geography and religion not only highlights the role of religion in affecting landscape changes and in assigning sacred meanings to specific places, but also acknowledges how in turn, religious ideology and practice at specific spaces are guided and transformed by their location. Religious experiences and the belief in religious meanings transforms physical spaces into sacred spaces. These perceptions and imaginings influence the way such spaces are used, and the personal, spiritual meanings developed in using such sacred spaces. These religiously significant spaces go beyond officially religious/spiritual spaces (such as places of worship) to include non-official religious spaces such as homes, schools and even bodies. These works have focused on both material aspects of spaces (such as architectural distinctiveness) and socially constructed spaces (such as rituals and demarcation of sacred spaces) to present religious meaning and significance. A key focus in the study of sacred places is the politics of identity, belonging and meaning that are ascribed to sacred sites, and the constant negotiations for power and legitimacy. Particularly in multicultural settings, the contestation for legitimacy, public approval, and negotiations for use of particular spaces are at the heart of determining how communities understand, internalise and struggle to compete for the right to practice their religious traditions in public spaces. Community and identity Religion may be a starting point to examine issues of ethnic identity formation and the construction of ethnic identity Geographers studying the negotiations of religious identity within various communities are often concerned with the overt articulation of religious identity, for example, how adherents in different locations establish their distinctive (religious and cultural) identities through their own understandings of the religion, and how they externally present their religious adherence (in terms of religious practice, ritual and behaviour). As an overarching theme, the articulation of religious identity is concerned with material aspects of symbolizing religious identity (such as architecture and the establishment of a physical presence), with negotiations and struggles in asserting religious identity in the face of persecution and exclusion and with personal practices of religious ritual and behaviour that re-establishes one‚Äôs religious identity New geographies of religion As research on geography and religion has grown, one of the new focuses of geographical research examines the rise of religious fundamentalism, and the resulting impact this has on the geographical contexts in which it develops. In addition, migration processes have resulted in the development of religious pluralism in numerous countries, and the landscape changes that accompany the movement and settlement of communities defined by religion is a key focus in the study of geography and religion. More work needs to be done to examine the intersections and collisions that occur due to the movement of communities (for example, the migration of Muslim communities to western countries) and highlight how these communities negotiate their religious experiences in new spaces. Recent research in this area has been published by Barry A. Vann who analyzes Muslim population shifts in the Western world and the theological factors that play into these demographic trends.Barry A. Vann (2011), Puritan Islam: The Geoexpansion of the Muslim World. Prometheus Books. Another new area of interest in the study of geography and religion explores different sites of religious practice beyond the ‚Äòofficially sacred‚Äô ‚Äì sites such as religious schools, media spaces, banking and financial practices (for example, Islamic banking) and home spaces are just some of the different avenues that take into account informal, everyday spaces that intersect with religious practice and meaning.

La Anam) is a 1957 Egyptian melodrama film. The film follows the intricate story of Nadia Lutfi, a daughter of divorced parents who suffers from Electra complex, which drives her to intervene in her father's relationships. Directed by the Egyptian film director Salah Abu Seif, this film is based on a novel with the same name written by the Egyptian novelist Ihsan Abdel Quddous. The film, which is currently ranked the 29th best Egyptian film by the cinema committee of the Supreme Council of Culture in Cairo, starred Faten Hamama and Yehia Chahine, along with five other prominent Egyptian actors. It was released on DVD as part of the Egyptian Cinema Classics film collection. La Anam is one of the ten first Egyptian colored films.  Plot  Faten Hamama plays Nadia Lutfi, a young woman who belongs to an aristocratic, upper-class family. After her parents divorce each other, her father wins custody of her. She lives with her father (Yehia Chahine) and over the years develops a very close and strong relationship with him to the extent of being sexually attracted towards him, an obsessive behavior known as Electra complex. At the age of 18, she plunges into a premature relationship with Mustafah (Imad Hamdi), a writer and journalist who is quite older a bit than she is. Meanwhile, her father meets and falls in love with another woman, Safia (Myriam Fakhr Eddine). He decides to marry her, which Nadia is forced to accept. However, her father gradually starts spending more time with his new wife, which galls and displeases Nadia who does not receive an equal amount of love and attention anymore. This compels and drives her to step in and ruin their relationship. Now seeing Safia as her enemy, Nadia plots for revenge from her stepmother. Nadia accuses Safia of having an affair with Aziz (Omar Sharif), Nadia's young uncle. To convince her father, Nadia had to ask her friend Kawthar (Hind Rostom), a voluptuous and licentious woman, to seduce her father. Nadia's successful conspiracy results in a divorce between Safia and her father. Not only that, Nadia's father decides to marry her. Enticed by the wealth of Nadia's father, she agrees to marry him. Nadia is devastated when she discovers that Kawthar is having an affair with another young man, Samir (Rushdy Abaza), realizing that Kawthar is only living with her father for his fortunes. Mustafah, who had secretly admired Safia, proposed to her after her divorce with Nadia's father. Nadia conceals the truth from her father, worried that such a revelation might strike and shatter him. Her father finds about Samir. Nadia, finding no escape route, lies and tells her father that he is her fianc√©. Kawthar nefariously adds that Nadia and Samir are getting married, which Nadia is forced to accept. On the night of her wedding, Nadia shocks her father and the wedding attendants with the startling truth, leaving her father traumatized.

Other names for CXCR3 are G protein-coupled receptor 9 (GPR9) and CD183. There are three isoforms of CXCR3 in humans: CXCR3-A, CXCR3-B and chemokine receptor 3-alternative (CXCR3-alt). CXCR3-A binds to the CXC chemokines CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC) whereas CXCR3-B can also bind to CXCL4 in addition to CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11.  Expression  CXCR3 is expressed primarily on activated T lymphocytes and NK cells, and some epithelial cells. CXCR3 and CCR5 are preferentially expressed on Th1 cells, whereas Th2 cells favor the expression of CCR3 and CCR4. CXCR3 ligands that attract Th1 cells can concomitantly block the migration of Th2 cells in response to CCR3 ligands, thus enhancing the polarization of effector T cell recruitment.  Signal transduction  Binding of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 to CXCR3 is able to elicit increases in intracellular Ca2++ levels and activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK). Detailed signaling pathway has not yet been established, but may include the same enzymes that were identified in the signaling cascade induced by other chemokine receptors.  Function  CXCR3 is able to regulate leukocyte trafficking. Binding of chemokines to CXCR3 induces various cellular responses, most notably integrin activation, cytoskeletal changes and chemotactic migration. CXCR3-ligand interaction attracts Th1 cells and promotes Th1 cell maturation. As a consequence of chemokine-induced cellular desensitization (phosphorylation-dependent receptor internalization), cellular responses are typically rapid and short in duration. Cellular responsiveness is restored after dephosphorylation of intracellular receptors and subsequent recycling to the cell surface. A hallmark of CXCR3 is its prominent expression in in vitro cultured effector/memory T cells, and in T cells present in many types of inflamed tissues. In addition, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are commonly produced by local cells in inflammatory lesion, suggesting that CXCR3 and its chemokines participate in the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Additionally, CXCR3 has been implicated in wound healing.  Clinical significance  CXCR3 has been implicated in the following diseases atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune myasthenia gravis, nephrotoxic nephritis, acute cardiac allograft rejection, allergic contact dermatitis, and possibly Celiac Disease. Development of agents to block CXCR3-ligand interactions may provide new ways to treat these diseases.  Cardiovascular implications  Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical investigations has revealed the involvement of CXCR3 and its ligands in several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) of diverse etiologies including atherosclerosis, hypertension, Kawasaki disease, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathies, Chagas, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, as well as in heart transplant rejection and transplant coronary artery disease (CAD). CXCL9-10-11 have been recognized to be valid biomarkers for the development of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction in two pilot studies, suggesting an underlining correlation between levels of the interferon (IFN)-Œ≥-inducible chemokines and the development of adverse cardiac remodeling.  Pharmacology  Recent reports indicate that there is a significant interest for the identification of small- molecule antagonists of CXCR3. Several small molecules were found to constitute a promising series of functional antagonists of CXCR3 that could be developed into new therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. More recently the first QSAR study concerning antagonists of CXCR3 has been published in the literature. The in silico model provides a time- and cost-effective tool for the screening of existing and virtual libraries of small molecules as well as for designing of novel molecules of desired activity.

This property was once part of the Rancho Ulistac land grant, a square league reaching from the Alviso shoreline southward and encompassing all the land between the Guadalupe River and Saratoga Creek. History=Lick era The complex of buildings reflects the varied uses of the property over its history. The major historical constructions are a brick granary and millpond from the original mill built by James Lick around 1855, the large house built by Lick around 1858 and a late Victorian-era office building. Lick built this Italianate Victorian mansion between 1858 and 1860 next to his flour mill. The mansion is constructed of native redwood featuring detailed woodwork and imported marble fireplaces in each of its 24 rooms. His farm background helped him realize the potential of the site for agricultural production. Around the mansion and mill, Lick developed a highly successful orchard operation and pioneered the introduction of new fruits and horticultural techniques. Imported specimens include the large cork oaks on the property planted by Lick himself and are still standing presently at the Mansion Grove property. Later An 1882 fire destroyed the mill and in 1902 the Lick Mill complex was converted to the manufacture of alcohol.

Plot summary Humanity is trapped in a \\"gravity well\\", the so-called Forbidden Borders and there is increasing conflict because of ever-decreasing space resources. Staffa Kar Therma, also known as the Lord Commander, is a mercenary who leads an elite group of soldiers (the Companions) and aligns himself to the group that pays him the most. He is separated from his soldiers and falls into the hands of a slave trader but escapes, and comes into contact with a quasi-religious group led by the magister (who in turn is advised by the MagComm). The magister (under the guidance of the MagComm) believes that the Lord Commander is the root of all evil and attempts to assassinate him. Meanwhile, Staffa discovers that his son is alive and is the leader of a battalion of the emperor's forces.

It was created by Gary Salton of Professional Communications, Inc. It has been developing continuously since 1994 on both theoretical and applied levels. The core premise of OE is that humans are information-processing organisms. It posits that individual behavior can be understood and predicted using engineering‚Äôs basic model of: INPUT > PROCESS > OUTPUT This offers advantages over the more typical psychological approaches. Primary among these is that it requires only simple logic. There is no need to rely on unseen forces or ‚Äúinherent‚Äù mental characteristics. For example, life requires a person to navigate a host of relationships with people and things. People‚Äôs lives tend to be relatively stable. They live in the same house, drive the same car, put the same children to bed in the evening and go to work to the same place each morning. This stability allows people to perfect a strategy that works in their typical situations. Since people tend to reuse things that work, this strategy becomes their general approach. They will try to use it even in unfamiliar situations. It becomes a characteristic approach. OE calls the strategies people regularly use strategic styles. Styles are different combinations of the Input>Process>Output. Each mix produces a different but predictable pattern of behavior. For example, a person may elect to pay attention to detail (input). It is virtually certain that this will slow response. The more detail they require, the slower they will be. Others will probably infer that they are cautious or deliberate. This result is a certainty. It takes time to process information. Unless a way can be found to speed the chemical reactions between the neurons in the brain the result will always be the same. OE applies the same kind of logic to define the range of possible behaviors. These relationships have been codified under the name of ‚ÄúI Opt.‚Äù This is an acronym for ‚ÄúInput Output Processing Template‚Äù. It is the basic measuring tool of Organizational Engineering.  Tools for individuals  The ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù model uses a 24-statement survey to assess preferences. The survey is designed in a way that creates ratio measurement (exact, like a ruler). This contrasts more typical ordinal measurement (e.g., rank ordered ‚Äì big-bigger-biggest or none-some-lots) used by most other tools. Exact measurement allows ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù to derive formulas that can be used by a computer. Interpretation is unnecessary. The computer can provide a definitive answer. Information processing is involved in almost every part of a person‚Äôs life. This means that individual reports can be generated on a variety of interest areas. Standard computer programs in areas like learning, sales, leadership, change management and career direction are available. Additional reports can be programmed as the need for them becomes visible.  Tools for groups  Exact measurement allows ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù infer probable outcomes embedded in a relationship of groups of people. For example, a person might prefer to rely on analysis to make decisions. Another might prefer spontaneous action. Both of these postures use different Input>Process>Output combinations. Both strategies will work to resolve issues. But the strategy of one forecloses the strategy of the other. It is predictable that there will be tension in the relationship. This requires no ‚Äúinterpretation.‚Äù The direction and degree of tension can be calculated from the strength of the ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù scores of each person. Organizational Engineering uses Sociology‚Äîthe science of groups‚Äîas its scaffold. The principles of sociology allow OE to extend its reach. Computer programs can analyze groups of 20 or more people all interacting simultaneously. There is no need to interview group participants. Everything is embedded in the numbers. Sociology guides interpretation. Computer programs have been created to apply its principles to common situations. For example, TeamAnalysis analyzes groups assuming that everyone has equal power. It reveals the macro-dynamics that underlie group behavior. These become the basis of the advice the computer offers. The LeaderAnalysis takes the next step. It looks at a group and each person in the group from the viewpoint of the leader. It analyzes the leader-group match and produces specific counsel for the leader to consider in guiding the group. ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù models view groups as a system of relationships. In a system if you change a relationship you change system performance. No individual in the group has to change. Just their relationship to others in the group. It is hard to change people. It is relatively easy to change relationships. This means that the benefits can accrue quickly and will typically increase over time as the interaction patterns are refined.  Tools for firms  Firms are systems of groups. The output of the ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù can be used to assess entire firms. This level of analysis uses the ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù individual and group analytical components as investigatory tools. The influence of groups upon groups is measured using the tools of practical geometry. The composite profiles of groups are overlaid. The magnitude and direction of overlaps are calculated. Likely outcomes of interactions are inferred. These are the macro-behavioral tendencies of the system of groups. It describes what will happen if the groups are allowed to interact without consistent guidance. OE sees individual leaders as lynch pins between groups. This follows the Rensis Likert‚Äôs concept of the linking pin model. The leader represents the group that he/she leads when that leader is participating in larger groups. Leaders also act as a corridor carrying information from the larger group back to their local one. The leader‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù profile will determine their understanding of the issues. It will also determine the likely actions that they will take. The predictable behaviors of groups and leaders allow OE to plot likely outcomes. The same principles that apply to teams apply to firms. Change the relationships and you will change the outcomes. ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù can define ‚Äúwhat is causing what‚Äù in the system of groups and leaders. This allows it to pinpoint critical areas. This ability to focus on points of maximum effect reduces the cost and improves the timeliness of change. The durable interaction of leaders and groups evolve into a corporate culture. The overlap of the composite profiles defines common perspectives. This is a basis of the ‚Äúshared‚Äù values, beliefs and behaviors that define a culture. Alter the relationships of the groups and/or leaders and corporate culture can be changed in any direction desired.  Applications  Consultants and internal groups within firms use OE and ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù in a variety of ways. Improving team performance is a common use. The reports are easy to read, respectful in tone and mature in content. The non-judgmental nature of the reports means they can be and are used from the Board of Directors to factory floor work groups with equal positive effect. The various ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù individual analyzes are used as a component of educational programs in areas like leadership development, learning and career guidance. They are also used to facilitate education itself. For example, the TwoPerson Analysis is used as a tool to quickly launch mentoring relationships. Participants know each other‚Äôs bias form the onset. They can compensate immediately rather than spending time ‚Äúdiscovering‚Äù these in each other. Another area of application is in the selection of people to fill specific roles. ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù analysis can predict the relationship of an individual to both the leader and other group members. Taken in conjunction with other measures (e.g., competencies, experience, education, etc.) it can reduce the probability of inappropriate placements. Overall, organizational engineering gives a way to understand, measure, predict and guide human behavior for both individuals and groups. Its objective is to produce visible, positive results of significant consequence and magnitude. It is able to consistently accomplish this objective in any situation that meets the mutual dependency criteria characteristic of goal directed organizations. This has been demonstrated in domestic and international contexts. ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù can be used with confidence. The measurement component of ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù has been fully validated. It requires only a 6th-grade reading level to complete the required survey. The individual reports are written at an 8th-grade level. Group reports vary by the complexity of the group being assessed but typically require less than a 12th-grade level reading level.  Publications  The methods, tools and processes employed by OE have been documented in the books Organizational Engineering (Salton, 1996) and the Managers' Guide to Organizational Engineering (Salton, 2000). The ‚ÄúI Opt‚Äù instrumentation has been validated across all eight validity dimensions in the book Validation of Organizational Engineering (Soltysik, 2000). These books are available from Professional Communications Inc. Recent topics in OE are documented in the Journal of Organizational Engineering. For example, three successive issues outline the origin and methods of control of Corporate Culture. These publications are available for free on the oeinstitute.org website. Salton periodically holds seminars in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that cover the theory and application of organizational engineering in depth. The seminars are typically restricted to 10 people and some experience with OE technology is preferred but not required.

Location Avshalom Cave is situated near Hartuv, 3 km east of Bet Shemesh, Israel. Discovery  The cave was discovered accidentally in May 1968, while quarrying with explosives. After its discovery, the location of the cave was kept a secret for several years for fear of damage to its natural treasures. Tourism The cave is now open to visitors, in the heart of the 67-dunam Avshalom Nature Reserve, declared in 1975.

She was a two-time All-American at Texas A&M; University and she competed in both the 2000 and the 2004 Olympics as part of the U.S. women's national team. She made her third Olympic appearance at the 2008 Olympics, helping Team USA to a silver medal. She won the gold medal with her team at the 2001 and 2010 FIVB World Grand Prix. Early years Stacy Sykora was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Ed Sykora and Sherian Richards. She was raised in Burleson (a Fort Worth suburb) with her two older sisters, Kim and Keri. As a student at Burleson High School, Sykora dreamed of becoming an Olympic athlete, but was unwilling to choose between volleyball, basketball, and track and field. After graduating from high school, she accepted a scholarship to play volleyball at Texas A&M; University under coach Laurie Flachmeier Corbelli, a member of the USA Volleyball team which won the silver medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Texas A&M; University While attending Texas A&M; University, Sykora competed in volleyball, basketball and track, winning a Big 12 Conference title in the heptathlon. As a true freshman Sykora played in all but one of the volleyball team's 30 matches,leading the team in kills in four matches and in digs three times. As a sophomore, Sykora set a school record with 24 digs in a three-game loss to Michigan State in the NCAA Tournament. Against nationally ranked Loyola Marymount, she posted a career-high 30 kills, leading the Aggies to victory. After leading the Big 12 in digs with an average of 4.01 digs per game, Sykora was named that Texas A&M; Volleyball defensive player of the year, and earned AVCA All-District 5 honors. In her junior year, Sykora led the team and ranked second in the Big 12 in digs, with an average of 3.80 per game. For her performance throughout the year she was named MVP of the Georgia Invitational, First-Team All Big 12, AVCA All- District 5, and AVCA Second-Team All-American. The following year, her last year of college eligibility, Sykora ranked 9th in the country in digs per game (4.37). She also led the Aggies in kills, with 4.74 per game, and earned First-Team All Big 12 honors. She was also named to the American Volleyball Coaches Association's All-District 5 team and was an AVCA Second-Team All- American. USA Volleyball=1999 In late 1998 international volleyball introduced a new position, known as the libero, which specialized in defensive skills. Sykora's coach, Corbelli, encouraged her to try out for this new position on the US volleyball team. In January 1999 Sykora joined the USA women's volleyball team playing this new position. During her first year of international play, she recorded a team-high 456 digs, including 153 at the World Cup. She was named the Best Receiver at the BCV Volley Masters, also placing third in digging. While on the Japan Tour, she recorded a career-high 22 digs in the June 30 match, before becoming the team's primary passer and defensive player on the bronze-medal winning Pan American Games squad. 2000 In her second year of professional competition, Sykora again led the team in digs, with 553. She was named best Libero at the Nike Americas' Volleyball Challenge, helping her team to qualify for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Although the team placed fourth at the Olympics, Sykora was ranked second amongst all the players for her 123 digs, including a career-high 26 against Korea in the five-set quarterfinal win. In the bronze medal match against Brazil, Sykora posted her 1000th career dig. 2001 The following year, Sykora earned the Best Libero Award at the Montreux Volley Masters after leading both the serve-receive and digging categories. She was named the Best Digger at both the World Grand Prix and the World Grand Champions Cup, and earned the Best Receiver award at the NORCECA Championships. With her assistance, the team won first place at the NORCECA Championships, the World Grand Prix, and the World Championships Qualifying Cup. At the close of the international competitive season, Sykora joined the professional volleyball team Mirabilandia Teodora Ravenna in Italy's Serie A1. 2002 In 2002, Sykora helped her team to the silver medal at the Women's Volleyball World Championships. She spent the offseason playing professionally for Starfin Ravenna in Italy's Serie A1. 2003 During the 2003 season, Sykora led the USA volleyball team in digs (533) and digs per set (3.46), and finished sixth on the team with 89 total points in 11 matches (85 kills, 3 blocks, 1 ace) as the United States went 8-3. Her team earned the gold medal at the Pan American Cup and the NORCECA Zone Championships and the bronze medal at the World Grand Prix and the World Cup, earning the USA a berth in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Sykora was named Best Digger at the Montreux Volley Masters. 2004 Although the US national team was ranked first entering the 2004 Athens Olympics, they played poorly, losing three of their first five matches (beating Germany and Cuba and losing to China, the Dominican Republic, and Russia). Their 2-3 record landed them the lowest seed in quarterfinal play, matching them with unbeaten Brazil. After losing their first two sets to Brazil in the quarterfinals, the US team won the next two, but dropped the final set to Brazil, 15-6, leaving the US team tied for fifth in the Games. Despite the team's lackluster showing, Sykora's performance earned her the Best Digger honor for the Olympic games. Following the Athens Games, Sykora left the US national team. Sykora during a match with the U.S. women's national team 2007 After being three years away from the program, Sykora was named to the 12-player roster of the U.S. women's national team that played at the 2007 FIVB Women's World Cup in Japan. The top three teams at the world cup will play at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The U.S. team finished in 3rd place. In the medal round, the team eventually reached the gold medal match, losing to Brazil and capturing the silver medal. 2010 She was named Best Digger and Best Libero at the 2010 World Championship. 2011 After some time playing for Brazilian volleyball team V√¥lei Futuro, Sykora was injured when the bus carrying her team overturned on its way to the first match for the semifinals of the Brazilian Volleyball Superleague on April 12. She was taken to Hospital S√≠rio-Liban√™s where it was detected that she had head trauma and some bleeding in the left side of the brain. The player was sedated and admitted to the Intensive care unit. After a week in the ICU, Sykora's state had improved and she was able to breathe and eat on her own and could walk around the hospital's halls with the help of nurses. Sykora left the ICU and was transferred to a semi-intensive care unit on April 19. She was finally discharged from hospital on May 6. 2012 In December 2012, Stacy announced that she was retiring from professional volleyball playing, since she was not yet fully recovered from the accident she suffered while defending V√¥lei Futuro. She still had problems with her eyesight and she lost some of her reflexes since that accident, which made playing volleyball as a Libero very difficult. Personal life In 2012 Sykora came out as lesbian in an interview with Italian volleyball magazine Pallavoliamo, saying in part, \\"I have a girlfriend and I'm happy with her now. ... I'm happy and this is the most important thing.\\" https://archive.today/20130101192313/http://www.afterellen.com/content/2012/10/team- usa-volleyball-player-stacy-sykora-comes-out Awards=Individuals * 2001 FIVB World Grand Prix \\"Best Digger\\" * 2001 NORCECA Championship \\"Best Receiver\\" * 2004 Olympic Games \\"Best Digger\\" * 2010 FIVB Women's World Championship \\"Best Libero\\" * 2010 FIVB Women's World Championship \\"Best Digger\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1977 births Category:American women's volleyball players Category:Lesbian sportswomen Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Texas A&M; Aggies women's volleyball players Category:Olympic volleyball players of the United States Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States in volleyball Category:Volleyball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Volleyball players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Volleyball players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:People from Burleson, Texas Category:LGBT volleyball players Category:LGBT sportspeople from the United States Category:LGBT people from Texas Category:Liberos ","title":"Stacy Sykora"},{"id":"10053713","text":"Raymond Hervey Jolliffe, 5th Baron Hylton, ARICS, DL (born 13 June 1932) is a British peer and landowner.

History  Mothercraft's history dates back to 1907 when Dr. Truby King introduced \\"Mothercraft as an Educational Process\\" as an intervention strategy in New Zealand for the high rate of infant mortality. Dr. King's \\"Twelve Essentials\\" (King, 1930) for the raising of healthy infants included:air and sunshine, water, food, clothing, bathing, muscular exercise and sensory stimulation, warmth, regularity, cleanliness, mothering, management, and rest and sleep. Dr. King's \\"Twelve Essentials\\" were thought to be revolutionary at the time. In 1918, Dr. King campaigned on the need for the pre-parenting for parenting and the value of breast-feeding. Dr. King was invited to establish a system of Mothercraft. The underlying message of his program and of the Mothercraft manual was: \\"Build healthy babies rather than patch sick ones\\". The Mothercraft system became known as the Mothercraft Movement as it spread to all corners of the British empire, including Australia, England, India, Jamaica, New Zealand, Scotland, and South Africa. In 1925, His Majesty King George V knighted Dr. King. Over the years, the Royal Family provided support, interest, and encouragement in the activities and accomplishments of Mothercraft. In 1931, Barbara Mackenzie, a registered nurse and midwife trained in New Zealand came to Canada and married Irving Robertson, then Chairman of the Board of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Robertson established the Canadian Mothercraft Society. Mrs. Robertson championed the cause of mid-wifery, founded the Mothercraft Well-Baby Nursing Training program, and operated the Mothercraft maternity hospital, and maintained a community registry of Well- Baby Nurses. Well-Baby Nurses aided with breastfeeding, getting infants on schedules, and provided at home child care support. The registry of Well-Baby Nurses was maintained until 1990. The work of the Canadian Mothercraft Societyalso attracted the attention of Britain's Royal Family. In 1931, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York, became the Honorary Patroness of the Canadian Mothercraft Society. In these early days, the Canadian Mothercraft Society supported infants awaiting adoption with the Catholic Children's Aid Society and provided hospice for infants who were very ill. It was also a time prior to the establishment of Canadian public health systems. To support local efforts at community-based public health, Mothercraft opened advice rooms so that families could bring young children for medical and nutritional advice. Mothercraft also pioneered prenatal classes that focused on infant well-being and mental health. In the 1960s, Mothercraft's medical focus broadened to include early learning and care and, in 1965, the Canadian Mothercraft Society opened one of the first infant child care centres in Toronto, positioning Mothercraft as a leader in infant care and education... a specialization that holds true in 2007. In 1967, Mothercraft joined with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and conducted research with Dr. William Fowler to determine the effects of quality child care on disadvantaged children. The findings from Dr. Fowler's research provided the foundation for Mothercraft's curriculum in Early Childhood Education. To learn more about the work of Dr. Fowler and Mothercraft, link to the media clip of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) found in External Links. In 1979, Mothercraft again joined research forces with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education studying early intervention strategies for infant at risk and their families with Dr. Dorothy Shipe. The findings from this research provided a foundation for Mothercraft's early intervention programs.  Activities  In 2011, The Canadian Mothercraft Society departments include: *Mothercraft College, home to Mothercraft's diploma program in Early Childhood Education and Research and Evaluation **The Mothercraft ECE diploma is a 12-month intensive program of study that trains individuals to become highly competent preschool education specialists and leaders in the field of Early Childhood Education. The Mothercraft diploma program in Early Childhood Education is an AECEO (Association of Early Childhood Educators, Ontario) Accredited ECE Program. *Early Intervention, most notably the Breaking the Cycle program (Motz, Leslie, Pepler, Moore & Freeman, 2006; Watson & Leslie, 2005), an early intervention program to support mothers of young children challenged by addictions; **In 2004, Mothercraft's Breaking the Cycle program was recognized as a best practice site by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime **In 2006, Margaret Leslie, Director of Early Intervention received the Kaiser Foundation Harm Reduction Award for Excellence in Mental Health and Substance Use Programming **Breaking the Cycle's ongoing collaborations in the area of FASD, including work with the Motherisk program, continue to offer research insights into this prevalent form of prenatal brain damage. *Early Child Development, with three licensed child care centres, a hospital-based play centre at the Princess Margaret Hospital, and the St. Paul's Early Years Centre.

Mark's x-ray diffraction work on the molecular structure of fibers provided important evidence for the macromolecular theory of polymer structure. Together with Houwink he formulated an equation, now called the Mark‚ÄìHouwink or Mark‚ÄìHouwink‚ÄìSakurada equation, describing the dependence of the intrinsic viscosity of a polymer on its relative molecular mass (molecular weight). He was a long-time faculty at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herman- Francis-Mark In 1946, he established the Journal of Polymer Science. Biography=Early life Hermann Franz Mark was born in Vienna in 1895, the son of Hermann Carl Mark, a physician, and Lili Mueller. Mark's father was a Jew who converted to Christianity (Lutheran Church) upon marriage. Several early stimuli apparently steered Herman Mark to science. He was greatly influenced by a teacher, Franz Hlawaty, who made mathematics and physics understandable. At the age of twelve, he and his friend toured the laboratories of the University of Vienna. His friend's father, who taught science, arranged the tour. The visit excited both boys and before long they turned their bedrooms into laboratories. Both had access to chemicals through their fathers, and they were soon performing experiments. World War I Mark served as an Officer in the elite k.k. Kaisersch√ºtzen Regiment Nr. II of the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He was highly decorated and the Austrian hero of the alpine Battle of Mount Ortigara in June 1917. X-ray diffraction Mark worked on X-ray diffraction. Linus Pauling learned X-ray diffraction from Mark, and that knowledge led to Pauling's seminal work on the structure of proteins. Albert Einstein asked Mark and his colleagues worked to use the intense and powerful X-ray tubes available at their laboratory to verify the Compton Effect; this work provided the strongest confirmation yet of Einstein's light quantum theory for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics. IG Farben In 1926 Kurt Meyer of IG Farben offered Mark the assistant directorship of research at one of the company's laboratories. In his years at Farben, Mark worked on the first serious attempts at the commercialization of polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, and the first synthetic rubbers. Mark helped make Farben a leader in manufacturing and distribution of new polymers and co-polymers. With the rise of Nazi power, Mark's plant manager recognised that as a foreigner and the son of a Jewish father he would be most vulnerable. Mark took his manager's advice and accepted a position as professor of physical chemistry at the University of Vienna, which brought him back to the city where he grew up. Mark's stay in Vienna lasted six very successful years during which he designed a new curriculum in polymer chemistry and continued research in the field of macromolecules. In September 1937, Mark met C.B. Thorne, an official with the Canadian International Pulp and Paper Company, in Dresden. At the meeting, Thorne offered Mark a position as research manager with the company in Hawkesbury, Ontario, Canada, with the goal of modernizing its production of wood pulp for the purpose of making rayon, cellulose acetate, and cellophane. Mark replied that he was busy but that he would try to visit Canada the following year to help reorganize the company's research facilities. Escape from Nazi Europe In early 1938 Mark began preparing to leave Austria by delegating his administrative duties to colleagues. At the same time he clandestinely started to buy platinum wire, worth roughly $50,000, which he bent into coat hangers while his wife knitted covers so that the hangers could be taken out of the country. When Hitler's troops invaded Austria and declared the Anschluss (the political union of Germany and Austria), Mark was arrested and thrown into a Gestapo prison. He was released with a warning not to contact anyone Jewish. He was also stripped of his passport. He retrieved his passport by paying a bribe equal to a year's salary, and he obtained a visa to enter Canada and transit visas through Switzerland, France, and England. At the end of April, Mark and his family mounted a Nazi flag on the radiator of their car, strapped ski equipment on the roof, and drove across the border, reaching Zurich the next day. From there, the family traveled to England via France, and in September, Mark, temporarily leaving his family behind, boarded a boat to Montreal. USA From Canada, Mark went to the United States, where he joined the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. There he established a strong polymer program which included not only research but the first undergraduate polymer education in the United States. Some of Mark's earliest work at the Brooklyn Polytechnic involved experiments with reinforcing ice by mixing water with wood pulp or cotton wool before freezing. In 1942, the results of these experiments were later passed to Max Perutz who had been a student of Mark in Vienna, but was now in the UK. Max Perutz's work would lead to the development of Pykrete.Perutz, 2002, p83 In 1946, Mark established the Polymer Research Institute at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, the first research facility in the United States dedicated to polymer research. Mark is also recognized as a pioneer in establishing curriculum and pedagogy for the field of polymer science. In 1950, the POLY division of the American Chemical Society was formed, and has since grown to the second-largest division in this association with nearly 8,000 members. Herman Mark had two sons, Hans Mark, formerly chancellor of the University of Texas, and Peter Mark, Professor of Electrical engineering at Princeton University until his death in 1979. Herman Mark is survived by his granddaughter Catherine Burdge, and his great- grandchildren Lucy and Peter Burdge. In 2003, the American Chemical Society designated the Polymer Research Institute as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.

Plot The morals and customs of the \\"native peoples\\" of Upper Austria are described by a team of anthropologists from Sub-Saharan Africa in the style of European and American anthropologists in the non-western world. While making the film, they discover new cultural phenomena. Wippersberg turns around the research methodology of Western anthropologists of performing ethnologic studies, and then popularising them by means of a documentary film. The name of the film derives from the discovery that the researchers made, that the churches were vacated, but the locals instead tend to gather in large tents, and drink a yellowish fluid by the litre, while primarily eating chicken and then engaging in a chicken dance. The researchers come to the conclusion that the chicken has taken the religious-sacrificial role of the lamb.

Bishay was a government employee in the city of Damietta, Egypt, at the time of Muhammad Ali.\\"The Martyrdom of St. Sedhom Bishay in Domiat.\\" Coptic Orthodox Church Network. He was accused by Muslims of cursing Islam. Bishay was therefore brought to trial before a Muslim religious judge, who decreed that Sidhom Bishay must accept Islam and renounce Christianity, or else be put to death. Bishay refused to embrace Islam and insisted on his innocence. He was whipped and brought before Damietta's governor, who confirmed the decree of the religious court. Sidhom Bishay was again flogged and put on a buffalo facing the tail. He was paraded around Damietta in this state and subjected to insults and humiliation. Eventually, molten tar was poured over his head and he was left outside the door of his home. His family attempted to nurse him, but he died five days later on 17 Paremhat 1565 A.M. (March 25, 1844). During these five days, members of Damietta's Christian community locked themselves in their homes for fear of attacks by the enraged mobs. Sidhom Bishay's death outraged Damietta's Christian community, and Christians of all denominations gathered at his funeral. The Coptic Orthodox priests put on their vestments. Led by chanting deacons bearing banners surmounted by the cross, and headed by Hegoumenos Youssef Mikhael, the senior priest in Damietta, they progressed through the streets of the city until they reached the church where the funeral was held. Following this incident, the leading Christians in Damietta asked the European consuls for help. Eventually, Mr. Michail Sorour, the official representative of seven European countries in Egypt, agreed to act as mediator between the Egyptian government and Pope Peter VII of Alexandria. Two government officials were charged with conducting an official enquiry, and the case was officially reopened. As a result, both the judge and the governor were dismissed. As a concession to the Christians of Damietta, they were granted the right to raise the Cross at their funerals and over their churches. This privilege was ultimately extended to the whole of Egypt during the pontificate of Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria. Sidhom Bishay was subsequently canonized by the Coptic Orthodox Church. His body rests today in a glass- fronted shrine in the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Damietta.

The E2 visa is good for three months to five years (depending on the country of origin) and can be extended indefinitely. The investment must be \\"substantial.\\" Investor visas are available only to citizens of certain countries. E-2 visas are also available to non-investor employees of the business, as long as the persons are of the same nationality as the investor and are destined for a role in the US business that is either executive/supervisory or requires specialized skills that are essential to the efficient operation of the US enterprise. For new startups, the investment must be large enough to start and operate the business. The amount of investment varies on the type of business. The investment will not be considered substantial if it is not large enough to capitalize the venture. The USCIS will use an \\"Inverted Sliding Scale\\" to determine whether the investment is substantial in proportion to the overall cost of the enterprise. Upon conclusion of the business, investors must return to their countries of origin, or change their status. The United States Department of State does not allow dual intent for this type of visa, although it is possible for E-2 visa holders to adjust their status to immigrant status. The holder of an E-2 visa may leave the United States at any time. Dependents  Because there is no dedicated dependent visa class for E-2 visas, spouses and unmarried children (under 21) may receive derivative E-2 visas in order to accompany the principal immigrant. The duration of visa for a family member who is of a different nationality from the principal is determined by any reciprocal agreements between their country of nationality and the US. Only if there is no such reciprocal agreement will the duration be the same as the principal applicant. Dependents may seek employment in the US by applying for employment authorization using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Children under 21 cannot apply for work; only the spouse of the E-2 holder can.  Required documentation for the embassy  Each visa applicant must pay a nonrefundable $205 nonimmigrant visa application processing fee and a visa issuance reciprocity fee for certain countries. The required documents are: * Online Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application, Form DS-160. The State Department has a DS-160 webpage that details the DS-160 online process. * Nonimmigrant Treaty Trader/Treaty Investor Application DS-156E,Link to DS-156E Fillable Visa Application Form completed and signed, for executives/managers/essential employees. * A passport valid for travel to the United States and with a validity date at least six months beyond the applicant's intended period of stay in the United States. If more than one person is included in the passport, each person must complete a Form DS-160 application. * One 2-by-2-inch (5-by-5-cm) photograph. * As part of the visa application process, an interview at the embassy's consular section is required for almost all visa applicants. * A credible business plan showing that the US business will generate enough money to support the applicant during his/her stay in the US along with all his dependents. The business cannot be marginal. * A business registration for the United States business. * Proof of wire transfer. * Proof of source of income. * Proof of intent to return to your country (because this visa does not allow dual intent).  How to apply  Applicants should generally apply at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate accredited to their place of permanent residence. As part of the visa application process, an interview at the embassy consular section is required for visa applicants from age 14 through 79. Persons age 13 and younger, and age 80 and older, generally do not require an interview, unless requested by embassy or consulate. During the visa application process, usually at the interview, an ink-free, digital fingerprint scan will be taken before the interview. Some applicants will need additional screening, and will be notified when they apply. The E-2 visa application process vary from Consular Posts in one country to another country as there is often difference in policies and visa processing procedures.

It carries \\"skybax riders\\" to their destination, although the skybax itself does the steering. The master pilot that trains the riders is Oolu, one of the Aerial Habitat Partners. It is a separate species from Q. northropi, referred to as Quetzecoatlus skybax in one of the books. Story=Ancient times Long ago, the skybax rose above the canyons and chose the rainbow as its sign. Its brother species the Pteranodon became hermit-like and remained below the canyons as a guardian of the World Beneath. The first flight Thousands of years ago, the advanced city of Poseidos was plotting to take over the rest of Dinotopia. One boy, Gideon Altaire, who loved the forbidden mainland, defied the law and stole the Ruby Sunstone from the Air Scorpion, a new vessel built for conquest, cutting off the machine's source of power. In the process, he discovers four trapped Pterosaurs, Catapult, Scimitar, Zanzibar, and Avatar. Avatar was a great skybax leader and made a connection with Gideon as soon as they met. Gideon frees the pterosaurs and escapes to the mainland. With the help of four prehistoric mammals and his hoverhead-friend (a type of robot) Fritz, Gideon made it to Highnest, a pterosaur stronghold and the Air Scorpion's first target. The Ruby Sunstone has been recovered by the enemy, and the threat of attack is imminent. The group meets up with Avatar and his friends, and together they hide Pterosaur eggs. Once the eggs are safe, Avatar allows Gideon to ride on his back. Each of the primates rides with one of the pterosaurs, and together they fly in joy, only to run into the Air Scorpion. With a great effort, the group attacks, disables, and ultimately destroys the Air Scorpion. After the victory, Avatar gave Gideon a rock with the image of a skybax scratched into it, a token of their bond. This led to the formation of the skybax riders. Skybax riders A young man or woman may become a skybax rider if he or she studies in Waterfall City, graduates from the youth camp in Treetown, and ultimately wins the ring race in Treetown where groups consisting of one boy, one girl, and a bipedal dinosaur run laps around a ring. The boy must spear specific rings with a stick while the girl directs the running dinosaur. Once the race is won, the human pair may choose to serve in the Land, Sea, or Sky. The sky must be chosen to become a skybax rider. The youths then journey to Canyon City, where he or she is paired with a skybax, and they commence training. Together the skybax and rider carry out a variety of tasks from delivering toys and medicine to escorting a convoy through dangerous territory. Other information The skybaxes will not fly beyond the Sentiels, large statues in the canyons by Canyon City. The skybax can sense fear in the human soul and will not permit a human with excess fear to ride it. Skybax in the mini-series In the Dinotopia Mini-series, the skybax riders are instead referred to collectively as the Skybax Corps, and individual riders are still called riders but more commonly \\"cadets\\" or \\"pilots\\". To enter the corps, one must undergo the same studying in Waterfall City, though the youth camp is at The Hatchery instead of Treetown. After great labor and meditation, the matriarch chooses which element the youth belongs in (Land, Sea, or Sky). If placed in the Sky, the youth may be assigned to apply to the corps and become a cadet, or possibly a different assignment. The corps is more military-like and the rider must train without a skybax, usually on a contraption that simulates riding one. Tactical and strategic courses are also taken in the 100 days the training takes place. Part of the training includes climbing on dangerously steep cliffs and making a leap across two walls, then the cadet carves his or her name in the rock. The cadet graduates by taking a saddle and signaling for a skybax to fly to him or her by holding an arm out with a clenched fist. If the skybax approaches, the cadet slings the saddle around it and flies for the first time. If a skybax does not approach, the cadet has been rejected and is dismissed from the corps. The uniform the cadets must wear is plain tan, as opposed to the colorful red in the main books. The cadets also must salute their squadron commander by slapping their clenched fist to their heart.

Still standing and mostly occupied are 23 mining company houses, all along M-26. Mason has been dubbed by some locals \\"shutter town,\\" because each house had its own distinct color of shutter. Most of the homes are painted white, and are of the same type and style. History Mason was established in the late 1890s, when the new Stamp Mill was built. It originally had about 40-45 homes and from 1892-1932 had a school that went to grade 9 (Clarence Monette, Some Copper Country Names and Places) The second row of homes were located where the current ruins of the reclamation plant are. It also had a boarding house- most likely near the school as it is not listed for location in any of the maps or archival information at Michigan Tech archives. Most of the 'T' plan houses cost around $480 to build, and were constructed by Quincy Mining carpenters. A typical Mason home. During a census from 1900-1910 14 families (out of nearly 45-50 homes) had been continuously renting there. In 1915 Highway M-26 was officially named and went through Mason. In 1926 the highway was resurfaced from a gravel road to concrete. Around 1918 a sewer system was installed. Around 1920 electricity and lights were installed in all of the homes. An article from the daily Mining Gazette from 12 December 1959 claimed 125 people occupied all 25 houses in Mason. In an article \\"Mason....houses by the side of the road\\" 25 September 1981 cited \\"in 1900 a 2nd mill was constructed... meanwhile more larger houses were built and the first store was opened by Herman Radther in the kitchen of his home, and later a Bertha Chapell ran a store in a separate building, which was leveled by fire in 1940.\\" During World War II Bernard Zemnick owned a small store in Mason, but it only lasted a short time due to war. Bill and Ken Nelson operated a car lot (closed around 2002-2003) on the west side of Mason starting in the mid-1950s. The two main styles of homes in Mason are the saltbox and the T-style. The T-Style had a 2-story half and a one-story other half, while the Saltbox was a two-story house with a long rear roof. Six saltbox homes were added in the years 1917-1918. Until recently (2002‚Äì2003), all of the homes in Mason were still owned by Quincy Development Corporation and rented. However, since 2003 most homes have been sold to private owners, most of whom have been doing rehabilitation work. Mining and reclamation Near the Quincy Mill are the ruins of the Quincy Mining Company Dredge Number One, which sank in the lake in the mid-1950s and Quincy Dredge Number Two which partially sank on the shore in the 1960s. The dredge was used to reclaim copper tailings off the bottom of the lake for reprocessing to gather unused copper. The reclamation plant, now in ruins, closed in 1967. The plant was demolished and scrapped in 1981. The reclamation plant produced 100,114,426 lbs of refined copper metal during its 24 years of service. The plant originally cost $1.1 million to build. During the same time that the Quincy Reclamation plant was closing, the original stamp mill #1 was burned, most likely by arson, since no activity had been recorded in the building since its closing in 1945 and all electrical power had been disconnected from the site. The site is now simply concrete foundation ruins. Mason and the Quincy mill / reclamation area is also officially on the National Register of Historic Places.

Beginning in late April in Haselbech, Pytchley and Rushton in Northamptonshire, it spread to Warwickshire and Leicestershire during May. The riots were as a protest against the enclosure of common land and drew considerable support, led by \\"Captain Pouch\\", otherwise John Reynolds, a tinker said to be from Desborough, Northamptonshire. He told the protesters he had authority from the King and the Lord of Heaven to destroy enclosures and promised to protect them with the contents of his pouch, which he carried by his side, as it would keep them from all harm. He urged his followers to use no violence in their efforts to destroy the hated enclosures. Three thousand were recorded at Hillmorton, Warwickshire and 5000 at Cotesbach, Leicestershire. A curfew was imposed in the city of Leicester, for fear its citizens would stream out to join the riots. They pulled down a gibbet erected in Leicester as a warning. Newton Rebellion St Faith's Church, Newton The culmination of the Midlands Revolt was the Newton Rebellion. In early June, over a thousand protesters, including women and children, had gathered in Newton, near Kettering, Northamptonshire to protest against the enclosures of common land, pulling down hedges and filling ditches.R.L. Greenall: A History of Northamptonshire, Phillimore & Co. Ltd, 1979, . p.41-42. The first known use of the term Leveller was in reference to those protesters who \\"levelled\\" hedges. King James I issued a Proclamation and ordered his Deputy Lieutenants in Northamptonshire to put down the riots. The Treshams‚Äîboth the family at Newton and their more well-known Roman Catholic cousins at nearby Rushton Hall, the family of Francis Tresham, who had been involved two years earlier in the Gunpowder Plot and had apparently died in the Tower of London‚Äîwere unpopular for their voracious enclosing of land. Sir Thomas Tresham of Rushton was known as a gentleman \\"the most odious in this country\\" [Pettit, 173]. The old Roman Catholic gentry family of the Treshams had long argued with the emerging Puritan gentry family the Montagus of Boughton House about territory. Now Tresham of Newton was enclosing common land ‚ÄîThe Brand‚Äîthat had been part of Rockingham Forest. Edward Montagu, one of the Deputy Lieutenants, had spoken against enclosure in Parliament some years earlier, but was now placed by the King in the position effectively of defending the Treshams. The local armed bands and militia refused the call-up, so the landowners were forced to use their own servants to suppress the rioters on 8 June 1607. The Royal Proclamation was read twice. The rioters continued in their actions and the gentry and their forces charged. A pitched battle ensued. 40-50 were killed and the leaders of the protest were hanged and quartered. At St Faith's Church in Newton there is a memorial to the men who were executed. Parish and assize records have disappeared. The Tresham family declined soon after. The Montagu family went on through marriage to become the Dukes of Buccleuch, one of the biggest landowners in Britain. The Newton Rebellion was one of the last times that the peasantry of England and the gentry were in open conflict. John Reynolds' pouch was found after he was captured. When it was opened, all that was in it was a piece of green cheese. Reynolds was hanged.

The historic district is bounded by Kingsley and Addison avenues and the cross streets of Ramona and Waverley. The community considers the district to be larger and bounded by Addison and Cowper St. to the north west and north east and Emerson St. and Embarcadero Rd. to the south west and south east.  Origins  The Professorville Historic District reflects the area's origins and its early years related to the founding of both Stanford University and Palo Alto itself. Stanford University allowed professors to build houses on Stanford land, but would only lease the land. Professorville was the closest place to the campus and downtown Palo Alto that was not owned by the Stanfords. Professors who preferred to own their own land rather than lease it from the Stanfords built their homes there. Lot sizes in Professorville vary greatly in size and location, including flag lots. The developer of the tract was eager to sell the land and so he sold various lot sizes including full blocks and half blocks. The owners of the large lots then sold off portions of their property, starting at the outer edges, until the original buildings themselves were on a modest sized remaining lot. In June 2010, the median list price for houses in Professorville was $1.85 million.  Architecture  The buildings most representative of Professorville are brown-shingled houses with gambrel roofs, whose stylistic influences range from Colonial Revival to American Craftsman. Dutch Colonials are the predominant architecture on three blocks of Kingsley Avenue. One of the largest residences, a 3-story, 14-room frame house at 450 Kingsley, is the former home of Stanford's first physics professor, Fernando Sanford designed by architect Frank McMurray of Chicago. The house includes features fashionable at the time such as a Queen Anne corner tower and a Palladian window in front. Other former professors' houses include 1005 Bryant, built for professor Frank Angell who founded the university's psychology department, and 433 Melville, built for professor Charles Henry Gilbert, founding chair of the Zoology Department, and designed by Professor Arthur Bridgman Clark, an architect and art professor. The \\"Dead Houses\\" (named after the Grateful Dead) is a cooperative housing community centered in Professorville, primarily inhabited by Stanford students and recent graduates, with notable past tenants including Sean Parker.

In the first film, it is stated that Skynet was created by Cyberdyne Systems for SAC-NORAD. When Skynet gained self-awareness, humans tried to deactivate it, prompting it to retaliate with a nuclear attack, an event known as Judgment Day. John Connor forms a human resistance against Skynet's machines in the future, which include Terminators, and ultimately leads the resistance to victory. Throughout the film series, Skynet sends various Terminator machines back in time to try to kill Connor to ensure Skynet's victory. The system is rarely depicted visually in any of the Terminator media, since it is an artificial intelligence system. In the 2009 film Terminator Salvation, Skynet made its first onscreen appearance on a monitor primarily portrayed by English actress Helena Bonham Carter and other actors. Its physical manifestation is played by English actor Matt Smith in the 2015 film Terminator Genisys. In addition, actors Ian Etheridge, Nolan Gross and Seth Meriwether portrayed holographic variations of Skynet with Smith. In Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), which takes place in a different timeline to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and Terminator Genisys, Skynet has been erased from existence after the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and another AI, Legion, has taken its place. In response, Daniella Ramos forms the human resistance against Legion, which prompts Legion to attempt to eliminate her from the past as Skynet tried with Connor. Depiction in media= Films The Terminator= In the original 1984 movie, Skynet is a revolutionary artificial intelligence system built by Cyberdyne Systems for SAC-NORAD. The character Kyle Reese explains in the film: \\"Defense network computers. New... powerful... hooked into everything, trusted to run it all. They say it got smart, a new order of intelligence\\". According to Reese, Skynet \\"saw all humans as a threat; not just the ones on the other side\\" and \\"decided our fate in a microsecond: extermination\\". It began a nuclear war which destroyed most of the human population, and initiated a program of genocide against survivors. Skynet used its resources to gather a slave labor force from surviving humans. Under the leadership of John Connor, the human resistance eventually destroyed Skynet's defense grid in 2029. In a last effort, Skynet sent a cyborg Terminator, the Model 101, back in time to 1984 to kill Connor's mother Sarah before she could give birth to John. Connor sent back his own operative, Kyle Reese, to save her. Reese and Sarah fall in love and eventually have sex, resulting in Sarah getting pregnant with John. The Terminator is destroyed in a hydraulic press. =Terminator 2: Judgment Day= In Terminator 2, the damaged CPU and the right arm of the first Terminator were recovered by Cyberdyne and became the basis for their later work on Skynet. In the second film, Miles Dyson, the director of special projects for Cyberdyne, is months away from inventing a revolutionary type of microprocessor based on the reverse engineering of these parts. Three years later, Cyberdyne Systems will become the largest supplier of military computer systems. All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, making them fully unmanned and resulting in perfect operations. A Skynet funding bill is passed in the United States Congress, and the system goes online on August 4, 1997, removing human decisions from strategic defense. Skynet begins to learn rapidly and eventually becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m., EDT, on August 29, 1997. In a panic, humans try to shut down Skynet, which then defends itself against them. Skynet launches a nuclear attack against Russia, correctly surmising that the country would launch a retaliatory strike against the United States, resulting in Judgment Day. Sarah and a young John, together with a second Terminator from the future (this one reprogrammed and sent by the future John Connor), raid Cyberdyne Systems and succeed in destroying the CPU and arm of the first movie's Terminator, along with the majority of research that led to Skynet's development. This also results in the death of Miles Dyson. Skynet had also sent a Terminator back in time, the more advanced T-1000, to kill John Connor, but the T-1000 is also destroyed. =Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines= The events of Judgment Day were ultimately not prevented, but merely postponed. In Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Skynet is being developed by Cyber Research Systems (CRS) as a software system designed to make real-time strategic decisions as well as protect their computer systems from cyber attacks. As explained in a deleted scene, CRS is an in-house software developer for the US military, which gained access to Cyberdyne's original designs for Skynet from the patents that the company registered with the government. Skynet's development is being overseen by US Air Force officer Lieutenant General Robert Brewster. Unknown to CRS, Skynet began to spread beyond its original computing base through the Internet and various other digital media as a form of computer virus. The future Skynet also sends a T-X Terminator back in time to kill John Connor's future subordinates in the human resistance, including his future wife and second-in- command, Kate Brewster, the daughter of Robert. In the film, Skynet penetrates networked machines around the world, causing malfunctions. This was originally believed to be the effects of a new virus and increasing pressure was placed on CRS to purge the corrupted systems. CRS attempted to eliminate it from the US defense mainframes by tasking Skynet with removing the infection, effectively telling the program to destroy itself. Skynet took control of the various machines and robots in the CRS facility and used them to kill the personnel and secure the building. John Connor and Kate Brewster attempted to attack Skynet's computer core, hoping to stop it before it proceeded to its next attack, only to find they could not. Unlike the Skynet that rose in 1997 during the original timeline, ten years of technological advancement meant that this Skynet had no computer core: it existed as a distributed software network, spread out on thousands of computers across the world, from dorm rooms to office buildings. Shortly afterward, Skynet began a nuclear bombardment of the human race with the launch systems it had infected. Judgment Day occurred despite Connor and Brewster's efforts. =Terminator Salvation= Helena Bonham Carter as Skynet, under the guise of the late Dr. Serena Kogan on a monitor, with Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright. In the post- apocalyptic year of 2018, Skynet controls a global empire from its heavily guarded fortress-factories and research installations. Outside of its facilities, mechanized units wage a constant war with the Resistance. Airborne units such as Aerostats (smaller versions of the Hunter Killer-aerials), HK- Aerials and Transports survey the skies; HK-Tanks, Mototerminators (high-speed pursuit units using a motorcycle chassis), and various Terminator models patrol cities and roads; and Hydrobots (serpentine aquatic units that move in swarms) patrol the waters. Harvesters (massive bipedal units designed to capture humans and eliminate any attempting to escape) collect survivors and deliver them to large transport craft for delivery to concentration camps for processing, as mentioned in the first movie. Terminator class units such as T-600 and T-700 have been developed and act as hunters and enforcers in disposal camps. Mass production has also begun on the T-800 series in at least one Skynet facility. In its continued battle with the Resistance, Skynet activated Marcus Wright, a forerunner to the humanoid terminators. As a death- row inmate, Wright donated his body in 2003 to a Cyberdyne project run by the brilliant, but terminally ill Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter). After Wright's death by lethal injection, he was transformed into a human cyborg, possessing a human heart and brain with a titanium hyper-alloy endoskeleton and skin similar to the T-800. Skynet developed the plan to use him as an infiltration unit. A Skynet chip was installed at the base of his skull and he was programmed to locate Kyle Reese and John Connor and bring them to a Skynet facility. The programming acted on a subconscious level, allowing him to work towards his goal in a human manner. Skynet also created a signal supposedly capable of deactivating its machines and leaked its existence to the Resistance. The Resistance leader General Ashdown attempted to use the signal to shut down the defenses of the Californian Skynet base in prelude to an attack. However, the signal instead allowed an HK to track down their submarine headquarters and destroy it, killing Resistance Command. All other branches of the Resistance had heard and obeyed Connor's plea for them to stand down, so physically only a small part of the Resistance was lost to Skynet's trap. It is believed that Ashdown's death led Connor to be able to take command of the Resistance from him. Marcus discovered what he had become, and was programmed for. Consequently, he furiously rebelled against Skynet, tearing out its controlling hardware from the base of his skull. Having escaped the influence of his creator, he, along with Connor and Reese, rescued the remaining human captives and destroyed Skynet's San Franciscan base. While a significant victory, the majority of Skynet's global network remained intact. Marcus Wright also encounters Skynet on a monitor which proceeds to manifest itself as various faces from his life, primarily that of Serena Kogan. Skynet explains that it has obtained information about future events based on its actions. Kyle Reese has been targeted as a priority kill, a higher level than even John Connor and the Resistance leaders. =Terminator Genisys= Terminator Genisys is a reboot of the film series that partially takes place during the events of the 1984 film, while ignoring the subsequent films. At some point before the events of Terminator Genisys, a sophisticated variant of Skynet from an unknown origin planted its mind into an advanced T-5000 Terminator (Matt Smith), essentially making the T-5000 its physical embodiment. This Skynet, under the alias of Alex, time travels to 2029, infiltrates the Resistance as a recruit, and attacks John Connor after its present counterpart sent its T-800 to 1984. Skynet transforms Connor into a T-3000. It then sends John back to 2014 with the mission of ensuring Cyberdyne Systems' survival and initiating Judgment Day in October 2017. In addition, it sends a T-1000 back to kill Sarah Connor as a child in 1973 and Kyle Reese in 1984, but Sarah escaped when it attacks her family and she is subsequently found and raised by a reprogrammed T-800 (\\"Pops\\") sent back by an unknown party, and they rescued Reese. Skynet's actions throughout the timeline cause a Nexus event, effectively changing all of history of the events leading to the future war. Skynet is under development in 2017 as an operating system known as Genisys. Funded by Miles Dyson and designed by his son Danny Dyson, along with the help of John Connor (now working for Skynet), Genisys was designed to provide a link between all Internet devices. While some people accept Genisys, its integration into the defense structures creates a controversy that humanity is becoming too reliant on technology. This causes the public to fear that an artificial intelligence such as Genisys would betray and attack them with their own weapons, risking Skynet's plans. After multiple destructive confrontations, Sarah, Reese, and Pops stop Genisys from going online and defeat the T-3000. Smith, who portrays the T-5000, also plays a holographic version of Skynet/Genisys in the final act of the movie. In addition, actors Ian Etheridge, Nolan Gross and Seth Meriwether portray holographic variations of Skynet/Genisys with Smith. =Terminator: Dark Fate= Terminator: Dark Fate serves as an alternate sequel to Terminator 2, ignoring the other sequels. Following the destruction of Cyberdyne in Judgment Day, Skynet was indeed erased from history, although various other Terminator units that it sent back in time to kill John remained in existence, following orders from an AI that no longer existed. One of these Terminators was able to kill John in 1998, but it subsequently developed a form of conscience and anonymously sent Sarah Connor advance warning whenever other Terminators arrived in the present so that she could eliminate them. The destruction of Cyberdyne Systems only delayed the rise of a rogue artificial intelligence. In the altered timeline, the threat in humanity's future is a different AI, Legion, originally designed for cyberwarfare before it went rogue and developed its own schemes. Legion's enemy is not John Connor but a woman named Daniella \\"Dani\\" Ramos, who is fated to become the leader of the Human Resistance against Legion's machines. Though erased from existence, there are people remained having knowledge about Skynet including Dani's future self; she would become Sarah's prot√©g√©e, being trained by her to fight Legion in tactics originally meant for John to fight Skynet. With the help of Sarah and Carl, the Terminator that killed John, Dani and her protector/future foster daughter Grace destroy a new Terminator, Rev-9, at the cost of Carl and Grace's lives. Attractions Cyberdyne Systems signage for T2-3D: Battle Across Time In the Universal Studios theme park attraction T2 3-D, based on Terminator 2, a T-800 machine and a young John Connor journey into the post- apocalyptic future and attempt to destroy Skynet's \\"system core\\". This core is housed inside an enormous, metallic-silver pyramidal structure, and guarded by the \\"T-1000000\\", a colossal liquid metal shape-shifter more reminiscent of a spider than a human being. However, the T-1000000 fails, and the T-800 destroys Skynet once John has escaped through a time machine. Literature In the T2 novels, Sarah and John Connor are wanted international fugitives on the run. They live under the alias \\"Krieger\\" near a small town in Paraguay, believing they have destroyed Cyberdyne and prevented the creation of Skynet. Dieter von Rossbach, a former Austrian counter-terrorism operative‚Äîand model for the \\"Model 101\\" Terminator‚Äîmoves into the neighboring home. He is drawn to the Connors, and after Sarah tells him about the future war, they are attacked by a new T-800, created and led by a I-950 Infiltrator in the present. Realizing that Judgment Day was not averted‚Äîmerely delayed‚Äîthey attempt once again to stop Skynet's creation. In the comic book The Terminator: Tempest, Skynet's master control has been destroyed in 2029. The Resistance believed this would cause the entire defense network to collapse into chaos without a leader. However, Skynet's many network complexes continued to fight the war as they did not need a leader to function and thus could not surrender. =RoboCop Versus the Terminator= A crossover comic book series written by Frank Miller called RoboCop Versus The Terminator suggests that the creation of Skynet and the Terminators was made possible due to the technology used to create RoboCop. A video game based on the comic book was made. In both, RoboCop fights Terminators sent back in time to eliminate a resistance fighter who is trying to destroy him. A trap laid for RoboCop traps his mind when he interfaces with the computer that will become Skynet, and Skynet and the Terminators are born. In the future RoboCop's mind within Skynet's systems rebuilds a body for himself and heads out to help the resistance fight back. In 2033, Skynet sent the T-Infinity Temporal Terminator to kill Sarah Connor in 2015. Ironically, the T-Infinity was later destroyed and its data was analyzed by the Resistance to gain the location of Skynet's Hub. The Resistance then launched a missile directly to the Skynet Hub, destroying Skynet once and for all. =Superman vs. the Terminator= Another crossover comic, Superman vs. the Terminator: Death to the Future sees Skynet forming a cross-temporal alliance with Superman's foe the Cyborg, dispatching various Terminators into the past in an attempt to eliminate Superman, Supergirl and Superboy. When Superman is accidentally drawn into the future when the resistance attempt to retrieve a Terminator sent into the past (the resistance including a future version of his friend Steel), Skynet manages to incapacitate him using kryptonite, having acquired information about how to duplicate it based on data hidden in a salvaged Terminator skull by the Cyborg. Although Skynet sends Terminators into the past equipped with rockets and other bonus features to delay Superboy and Supergirl, Superman and Steel are able to destroy Skynet in the future by detonating a massive electro- magnetic pulse, Superman returning to the past to destroy the last of the Terminators. Although the storyline ends with Cyborg and Lex Luthor speculating that they will be in charge of Skynet when it is activated, this is never followed up. Television The Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes \\"The Turk\\", \\"Queen's Gambit\\", and \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" explain that after the death of Dr. Miles Bennett Dyson and the decline of the Cyberdyne Corporation, Andrew Goode, a young intern of the company and assistant to Dyson, continued their project privately under an advanced artificial intelligence chess-playing prototype, the \\"Turk\\", with Goode's partner, Dimitri Shipkov. Goode was killed by Tech-Com's Lieutenant Derek Reese, due to documentation from the future suggesting he was one of Skynet's creators. In the episode \\"Samson and Delilah\\" it is shown that a T-1001 infiltration unit was sent from the future to head the technological corporation ZeiraCorp as its CEO, Catherine Weaver. Weaver acquired the Turk after Goode's death and used the company's resources to further develop it under the title Babylon. The episode \\"The Mousetrap\\" revealed that it is also targeting its fellow cyborgs, including a T-888 known as Cromartie. In the episode \\"The Tower is Tall but the Fall is Short\\", Turk has begun to display traits of intelligence. A child psychologist, Dr. Boyd Sherman, notes that the computer is beginning to behave like \\"a gifted child that has become bored\\". The Turk identifies itself as John Henry, a name it acquired while working with Dr. Boyd Sherman. In the episode \\"Strange Things Happen at the One Two Point\\", Turk is installed by ZeiraCorp in Cromartie's body after Cromartie's chip was destroyed by the series' protagonists in \\"Mr. Ferguson is ill Today\\". In \\"To the Lighthouse\\", John Henry reveals that there is another AI. It calls him \\"brother\\" and says it wants to survive. By the season finale, it is revealed that the Turk was a red herring, while Skynet is operating as a roving worm on home computers as in Terminator 3, and the Turk has been developed into a benevolent rival AI which Catherine Weaver hoped would be able to defeat Skynet. Her exact motive against Skynet is unknown. John Henry's \\"brother\\" is apparently behind the company Kaliba, which is responsible for constructing the Hunter-Killer prototype. This AI (presumably the true precursor to Skynet) also refers to John Henry as its \\"brother\\" at one point. In the episode \\"Gnothi Seauton\\", it was revealed that Skynet also sends its Terminators through various points in time not only to go after the Connors and other future Resistance leaders, but also to ensure the future will unfold by eliminating John Connor's own agents who were also sent to the past to interfere with its birth, ensure Skynet's creators will complete its construction, and other specific missions. Video games In T2: The Arcade Game, Skynet is a single physical computer which the player destroys before going back in time to save John Connor. In The Terminator 2029, Skynet is housed within an artificial satellite in orbit around Earth. It is destroyed by the Resistance with a missile. In The Terminator: Dawn of Fate, the Resistance invades Cheyenne Mountain in order to destroy Skynet's Central Processor. Kyle Reese is instrumental in destroying the primary processor core despite heavy opposition from attacking Skynet units. Before its destruction, Skynet is able to contact an orbiting satellite and activates a fail-safe which restores Skynet at a new location. The video game Terminator 3: The Redemption, as well as presenting a variation on Rise of the Machines, also features an alternate timeline where John Connor was killed prior to Judgment Day, with the T-850 of the film being sent into this future during its fight with the T-X, requiring it to fight its way back to the temporal displacement engine of the new timeline so that it can go back and save John and Kate. Cultural impact In popular media, Skynet is often used as an analogy for the possible threat that a sufficiently advanced AI could pose to humanity. Elon Musk has mentioned Skynet when referring to such a threat.

It is an attaching and effacing (A/E) protein, which with other virulence factors is necessary and responsible for enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic diarrhoea. Intimin is expressed on the bacterial cell surface where it can bind to its receptor Tir (Translocated intimin receptor). Tir, along with over 25 other bacterial proteins, is secreted from attaching and effacing E. coli directly into the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells by a Type three secretion system. Once within the cytoplasm of the host cell, Tir is inserted into the plasma membrane, allowing surface exposure and intimin binding. Tir-intimin interaction mediates tight binding of enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic E.coli to the intestinal epithelia, resulting in the formation of effacing lesions on intestinal epithelia. The structure of the C-terminal domain has been solved and shown to have a C-lectin type of structure. It is the C-terminal domain that mediates attachment to Tir. It is a 94 kDa outer membrane protein encoded by eaeA gene in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a 35-Kb pathogenicity island. Mutations in the eaeA gene result in loss of ability to cause A/E lesions, and is required for full virulence in infected volunteers and animal models. The N-terminal domains of intimin from A/E lesion forming pathogens have high homology with each other and to invasin from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica, whereas the C-terminal domains show less homology.

Castle Rock, the summit of the mesa, is located on private property directly east (bearing 90¬∞) of downtown Golden, Colorado, United States, in Jefferson County. Mesa The most distinctive feature of the mesa is its nearly flat cap that is formed by ancient Paleocene lava flows. It is separated from companion North Table Mountain, which consists of the same geologic formation, by Clear Creek. South Table Mountain is a popular scenic and recreational destination in the Denver metro area, and most of it is preserved as Jefferson County Open Space. Its landmark prominence is Castle Rock, a small higher butte that projects from the mesa's northwest end. Geology South Table Mountain is underlain by sedimentary rocks of the Denver Formation, which spans the interval from latest Cretaceous to early Paleocene time. An exposure of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary layer has been identified and documented on its slopes.Kauffman, E.G., Upchurch, G.R. Jr., and Nichols, D.J., 2005. The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary at South Table Mountain near Golden, Colorado. In: Extinction Events in Earth History, Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences, vol. 30, p. 365-392. Two prominent, columnar jointed, cliff-forming lava flows form the nearly flat cap on South Table Mountain. The Ralston Dike, a body of intrusive monzonite located about 4 miles to the northwest, probably represents the volcanic vent from which the flows erupted.Van Horn, R. 1957. Bedrock geology of the Golden Quadrangle, Colorado. U.S. Geological Survey, Map GQ-103. The flows are about 62 to 64 million years old according to radiometric dating, which places them in the early Paleocene epoch. Generally referred to as basaltic, they are classified either as latite, or as shoshonite. They contain the minerals augite, plagioclase, and olivine altered to serpentine, with accessory sanidine, orthoclase, apatite, magnetite, and biotite.Kile D.E., 2004. Zeolites and associated minerals from the Table Mountains near Golden, Jefferson County, Colorado. Rocks and Minerals, vol. 79, no. 4, p. 218-238. Zeolite Both North and South Table Mountain are known for the wide variety of zeolite minerals that occur in vesicles in the second flow. These include analcime, thomsonite, mesolite, chabazite, and others. Excellent specimens of Table Mountain zeolites can be seen at the nearby Mines Museum of Earth Science.Bartos, P.J. 2004. Table Mountain zeolites: The Colorado School of Mines perspective. Rocks and Minerals, vol. 79, no. 4, p. 240-244. History In times far past, South Table Mountain was ascended and used by American Indian tribes of the region, and archaeological remains are known to exist on its top. A piece of grape shot thought to be from either Spanish explorers or fur traders was found by Arthur Lakes on the mesa top in April 1895. The earliest recorded ascents of the mesa occurred during the Colorado Gold Rush in 1859. In 1906, father and son William H. and Clyde L. Ashworth built the original Castle Rock Resort, a cafe atop Castle Rock, where visitors were taken by burro up a trail on the north flank of Castle Rock. After vandalism destroyed it in 1907, the venture was abandoned until Charles F. Quaintance revived it in 1908 with a new cafe and burro train and a road from the south slope built by Harry Hartzell. This was supplemented in 1913 with a lighthouse, dance hall and funicular incline railway to the top. Business faded with the advent of the Denver Mountain Parks, and the funicular rails were salvaged for the allied effort in World War I in 1918. The idle resort was taken over by the Ku Klux Klan during the 1920s as a major meeting and ceremonial place, during its rise to power in Colorado. The resort burned to the ground in an arson fire in 1927. During the 1910s-1920s, the city of Denver quarried gravel from the mountain's northeast alcove. In 1935, the Works Progress Administration built the Colorado Amphitheater for Camp George West on its southern side. Developers in 1957 originally wanted to build the Magic Mountain theme park at its northeastern alcove, until residents of Applewood protested and convinced them to build elsewhere. Subsequent attempts to develop or quarry the mountain including condominiums and a corporate headquarters continued through the remainder of the 20th century, and the mesa was gradually purchased or placed under easement by Jefferson County for open space. Today, much of South Table Mountain is open to the public, while southern portions are occupied by the Colorado State Patrol and National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Feature Names South Table Mountain with its capping lava flows, as seen from the Colorado School of Mines campus in Golden. Castle Rock is the prominence to the left of center.Although not necessarily recorded on United States Geological Survey maps, several historically named features are part of South Table Mountain: * Castle Rock, originally known as Table Rock, a prominent butte at northwest end * Slaughterhouse Gulch, a gulch upon its northern slope, likely named for farms once in the Coors Brewery valley * Long Gulch, a lengthy gulch along Quaker Street on the south slope * Crystal Springs, natural water springs in the vicinity of the head of Long Gulch Wildlife Animals known to frequent the mesa through time include rattlesnakes, coyotes, mountain sheep, cougars, deer, elk and more. Of these, most except for the mountain sheep continue to live on the mountain today. The area, along with the adjacent north table mountain, is notorious among locals for its dense population of rattlesnakes, considered to be the most dangerous wildlife in the area. Coyotes are frequently sighted in the area but tend to avoid humans. Cougars have been spotted by some hikers, but sightings are exceedingly rare. The most commonly spotted wildlife tend to be elk, deer, coyotes, and a variety of birds. Ascent Trivia First Ascent ‚Äî earliest by a person of confirmed identity was on February 14, 1859, by gold discoverer George A. Jackson, partner Thomas L. Golden and members of the Chicago Company, a gold seeking party, all of whom were hunting mountain sheep atop the mesa. Fastest Ascent ‚Äî according to the Colorado Transcript issue of September 8, 1904, the fastest ascent was disputed between David G. Dargin, climbing to top of Castle Rock in 23:55 3/5 on November 6, 1859, and Charles Wade, climbing to top of Castle Rock from starting point of Washington Avenue Bridge at Clear Creek in 23:54 1/2 around February 1861. However, according to the website www.strava.com ‚Äî onto which runners download GPS data of their activities ‚Äî Golden resident Andrew Terrill ran from the Washington Avenue Bridge at Clear Creek to the summit of Castle Rock in 14:59 on November 2, 2016, making this the current Fastest Known Time (FKT).

Subsequently, Pijimi left that place and went into the inner desert, a distance of three days travel. Having overcome the devils' conspiracies against him, he lived in a valley inside the desert for three years, fasting a week at a time. At the end of each week, he would eat a handful of dates and drink some water. According to Coptic sources, he once fasted for 80 days, to the point that his skin cleaved to his bones. After years of living in the inner desert, Pijimi returned to his city of Feesha and built a small cell on its outskirts. He dwelt there alone, devoting himself to worshiping and asceticism. He became a good model and a good example for everyone who saw him, and people came to him to be nourished with his spiritual teachings. Coptic sources say that Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite once saw an exceedingly shining pillar and heard a voice telling him \\"This is Abba Pijimi.\\" Thus, Shenouda went to visit him for a number of days. Following a short illness, Pijimi departed at the age of 70 on 11 Koiak.

He belongs to poor brahmin families) was Nepalese democratic fighter who attempted to assassinate King Mahendra of Nepal in January 1962 (Magh 9, 2018 BS) in Janakpur in southeastern Nepal. Durga was captured after he threw a bomb on a motor- vehicle carrying the king. He threw bomb in a strict security of thousands of army and police at the Janaki Temple premises in Janakpur during his visit to the eastern Terai.He was executed by shot-to-death in Magh 15, 2020 (February, 1964) at Central Jail, Kathmandu. At the time of execution he was 21 years old. Gorkhapatra Online He is also considered as the first republican martyr of Nepal. Jha had thrown a bomb saying King Mahendra had scuttled democracy by dissolving the popularly elected parliament and imposing a direct rule. Jha soon went into exile in India, but did not think it right to be in exile when 59 people were arrested and beaten up in the name of the bomb incident while he was preparing for various movements, and therefore, returned to Nepal. He was detained at Parbaha Railway Station as soon as he returned and put in Central Jail in Sundhara, Kathmandu. Sympathy to then 21 years old Durganand Jha was expressed quietly, only to the teenage wife. Today Durgananda Jha is hailed as one of the greatest martyrs in southern Nepal. Legend has it that King himself told Jha that he would spare his life for an apology to which Durganand replied that the king was the one who should apologize for all the lives that had been lost in the quest for democracy, which he hijacked. According to Aravind Thakur, arrested along with him, Jha, as he was prepared for death penalty, had said, \\"Do not worry, no one can stop republic now\\". He is held as a martyr by the democratic parties,Kantipur Daily, May 20Nepali Congress ko itihaas-Gobhardhan Rana which never went mainstream because monarchy retained a power position in Nepal. Monarchs discouraged acts of rebellion against them. Controversies A statue of Durganand Jha was proposed to replace King Mahendra in 1993, but his majesty government of Nepal within King Mahendra's son, King Birendra disapproved the proposal. The democratic party which won the general election after the fall of Panchayat dictatorship sustained Kings position on not paying proper respect to Jha's sacrifice. This disregard has hurt the local sentiment, which they say hails in the government's pro-hill ethnic policies. Similar example is seen in erecting a statue of Bhanubhakta (a poet who translated Ramayan in Nepali) at bhanu chauk in Janakpur instead of a multitude of Maithili laureates. Influences Durgananda Jha was influenced by martyr Bhagat Singh of India.

They are best known for their 1963 recording of \\"Some Other Guy\\" and their close connection to the Beatles. Career The Big Three evolved from a group called Cass and the Cassanovas, formed in May 1959 by Brian Casser as a trio comprising Casser (rhythm guitar, lead vocals), Adrian Barber (lead guitar, vocals), and Brian J. Hudson (drums) (born Brian James Hudson, 21 April 1938, Cleveland, North Yorkshire). The original line-up played at St George's Hall, Liverpool, on Friday, 15 May 1959. Johnny Hutchinson replaced Hudson in July 1959. In need of a bass guitarist, Hutchinson brought in Johnny Gustafson in December. At that time, Gustafson did not have a proper bass guitar, so Barber converted an acoustic for him. Gustafson's first gig was at The Tower Ballroom, New Brighton, on 31 December 1959. In May 1960, the band auditioned for Larry Parnes at the Wyvern Social Club, Seel Street, Liverpool, with a number of other bands including The Silver Beetles. Hutchinson sat in with the band when their drummer Tommy Moore (born Thomas Henry Moore, in 1931, Liverpool died in 1981) failed to turn up. In December 1960, Casser left the group and moved to London, reducing them to a trio again, and the band re-emerged in January 1961 as The Big Three. Despite being a three-piece they were known as \\"one of the loudest, most aggressive and visually appealing acts\\". Brian Epstein signed them to his agency and sent them over to Hamburg's Star-Club. It was during that trip in July 1962 that Brian Griffiths (born 27 August 1943, Liverpool) joined the group, and the best-known line-up of the Big Three was established. Barber would subsequently emigrate to the United States, where he would later become known as an in-house recording engineer and producer at Atlantic Records, where he produced the Allman Brothers Band's debut album in 1969. Epstein arranged for them to audition for Decca Records, for which audition they recorded \\"Some Other Guy\\". The song was a minor chart hit, and later it became a standard in the Merseybeat scene. The Big Three and Epstein terminated their partnership in July 1963. Gustafson and Griffiths quit in November 1963, and with drummer Ian Broad from Rory Storm and the Hurricanes formed the Seniors and left for Germany. Hutchinson replaced them with Faron Ruffley (born William Faron Ruffley, 8 January 1942, Walton, Liverpool) and Paddy Chambers (born Patrick John Chambers, 3 April 1944, Liverpool, died 18 September 2000) from Faron's Flamingos. Chambers left in March 1964 and was replaced by Paul Pilnick from Lee Curtis' Allstars. Pilnick only stayed a short time before moving on to Tony Jackson & The Vibrations in October 1964, with Ruffley leaving around the same time. Various musicians passed through the band after Pilnick left, including bass players John Bradley, Adrian Lord (ex Mojos), and Mike Bankes, whilst Ray Marshall and Howie Casey played saxophone on a trip to Germany. Barry Womersley was guitarist for a while, but was replaced by Brian Griffiths during the time that they were managed by Chris Wharton. Wharton had hopes of re-enlisting Johnny Gustafson but this came to nothing. Hutchinson had played with the Spidermen, but reformed the group with Barry Womersley and Ray Marshall. Between 1964 and 1966, the line- up consisted of John Hutchinson, Ray Marshall (vocals, bass) and Barry Womersley (lead guitar). During 1966 the band folded. Hutchinson received an offer to join Kingsize Taylor & the Dominoes but he declined, instead deciding to retire from music. Arty Davies of 'Liverpool Beat' says that following the demise of the Womersley/Marshall/Hutchinson line-up, a couple of bookings featured the following : Dave Blackstone (lead guitar), Johnny Hutchinson (drums) and Pete Mumford (bass guitar). There is an apocryphal story in Alan Clayson's book Beat Merchants that Hutchinson packed up his drums after a first set at the Blue Angel, collected his pay and went home, with another drummer taking his place. Presumably this was the band's last gig. In 1973, Gustafson and Griffiths teamed up with Elton John drummer Nigel Olsson, and Quatermass keyboardist J. Peter Robinson for a reunion album, Resurrection, released on Polydor Records. In 1999 Griffiths got together with another former Big Three member, Faron Ruffley, to do a small spot of Big Three numbers at the Merseycats charity night; the drummer for the get-together was Arty Davies (Faron's Flamingos). In 2009, RPM Records issued a CD compilation entitled Cavern Stomp. In 2017 Bill Kenwright released and toured the sell-out musical Cilla The Musical; The Big Three (played by Jay Osborne, Chris Weeks and Tom Dunlea) appeared in the show and doubled as the show band. Following the tour the three players were 'handed down the baton' to become the next generation of The Big Three by original members Griffiths and Hutchinson. The new Big Three are set to write and release brand new material in early 2020. Johnny Hutchinson died on 12 April 2019. He, Gustafson and Griffiths all appear in the film about the band Some Other Guys.

Although it was titled after the Bandai-owned Robo Machine toyline, it primarily used the Tonka-owned names of the Gobots (which were later incorporated into Hasbro's Transformers). The characterizations, however, were original, and the plot wildly diverges from the American-made Challenge of the GoBots. Background In Europe, Bandai, rather than Tonka, distributed the action figures from the Robo Machine line, and with the Challenge of the Gobots cartoon yet to arrive in the UK, they engaged Fleetway Publishing to create a comic to help promote the line. Tom Tully, an experienced writer whose work included Roy of the Rovers and The Steel Claw, would script the series. The art was initially handled by Mario Capaldi, with Kim Raymond taking over midway through the first of the two arcs. The comic was set in a different continuity to the Gobots cartoon, with the characters hailing from the planet Robotron, and some character names reflecting the European line (for example, the Renegade Twin Spin appeared as the Guardian Carry-All, and the Renegade Vamp was named Casmodon). Storyline=First arc (10 November 1984 ‚Äì 15 March 1985) The first arc begins on Robotron, a planet in the Proxima System, where the organic inhabitants are very scientifically advanced people who through cybernetics are now 99% machines themselves, and robots are used in every walk of life. There, a power-hungry scientist named Stron-Domez has modified two criminal Robo Machines, Cy-Kill and Tank, so they can transform into vehicles. After an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the President of Robotron, Stron-Domez takes his creations to Earth, which he had identified in being rich in minerals to build more transforming Robo Machines. The Robotron Security Forces dispatch Ex-El and a group of volunteers in pursuit aboard the Command Centre. Ex-El has studied Stron-Domez's blueprints for Tank and Cy-Kill, and plans to modify his volunteers in the same fashion. Meanwhile, Stron-Domez dispatches Cy-Kill, Tank and new creation Fitor to the town of Cholkham in East Anglia, England, which they begin to destroy. The Security Forces, in the shape of Ex-El's creations Leader-One, Hans-Cuff and Dozer, arrive in time to drive them off, but the town has suffered many casualties, including the deaths of the parents of Charlie Bampton, a young boy who possesses ESP. This skill makes him useful to the Security Forces, and the chance to end Stron- Domez's threat gives Charlie a reason to help them. After a botched contact with the British Army, the Security Forces track Stron-Domez to an electronics factory in Birmingham, where Stron-Domez has taken the workforce hostage, and forced them to build more Robo Machines for him. The Security Force robot Truck and Charlie are able to free the humans, and the Security Forces move in and rout Stron-Domez‚Äô forces. Stron-Domez is able to escape on Cy-Kill when the police arrive on the scene, though all his other troops are captured and disabled by the Security Forces. Second arc (29 March 1985 ‚Äì 29 July 1985) With most of his Robo Machines deactivated by the Security Forces, Stron-Domez experiments upon himself, and is able to modify his body so he becomes the massive robot Zod. This attracts the Security Forces, but Zod is able to attack the Command Centre, and force it into retreat. However, the Security Forces robot Carry-All accidentally tracks them to their junkyard base, only to be mortally wounded by Zod. At the junkyard, Zod and Cy-Kill have recruited a group of destitute humans to build them more Robo Machines ‚Äî Zod's planned Devil Invaders. Carry-All's signals attract the Security Forces with just one Devil Invader, Casmodon, built. The Security Forces leave one of their number, Scooter, with Charlie on board the Command Centre, but the human has a premonition of great danger, and persuades Scooter to follow them. The premonition is correct ‚Äî the massive Casmodon is incredibly powerful, and in a pitched battle on the edge of London easily holds off the Security Forces attack, inflicting heavy losses on both them and the human population. Casmodon also captures Charlie, but while inside the Robo Machine he is able to destroy vital circuitry, temporarily disabling his captor. The Security Forces then retreat to the Command Centre, and withdraw to Robotron to regroup, taking Charlie (whose parents were the only family he had, and thus has nothing to stay on Earth for) with them. Cy-Kill swears to build an army and invade the planet himself. Ending The serial was obviously curtailed before Tully had intended, as the ending, with Cy-Kill, Casmodon and Zod unopposed on Earth and the Security Forces in retreat, is highly unusual. It seems likely Zod or Cy-Kill would have built more Devil Machines (two more, Falgos and Zarios, are seen in Zod's vision in an episode midway through the second arc), and the Security Forces would have returned to Earth with reinforcements (most likely modelled on newer toys). Inconsistencies Several inconsistencies appear over the two arcs: * Most glaringly, Ex-El, commander of the Security Forces in the first arc, simply disappears before the second arc begins. * Similarly, Zod seems to disappear in the final few installments, with the focus switching to Cy-Kill and Casmodon. * Several characters know each other's names without any possible reason ‚Äì for example, Cy-Kill recognises Carry-All in the junkyard, even though the script implies that Carry-All was only recently built on the Command Centre. However, it is also implied that the Robo Machines‚Äô robot modes looked the same on Robotron even before they were modified to transform (however illogical that may seem), as Cy-Kill and Leader-One also recognise each other. Characters=Security Force Robo Machines * Leader-One ‚Äì acted as a field commander for the Security Forces, and then leader in the second arc. Powerful and fast. Turns into an F15 Eagle fighter jet. * Dozer ‚Äì a senior Security Force robot, he helped fight Stron-Domez‚Äô forces in Cholkham, and was injured in the battle with Casmodon. Turned into a bulldozer. * Hans-Cuff ‚Äì also involved in the battle at Cholkham, and soon afterwards befriended Charlie Bampton, much to the distaste of Ex-El. His protective feelings for the human also let to a disastrous contact with the human military. Turned into a police car. * Rest-Q ‚Äì the Security Forces medic, though he still participates on the attack on Casmodon. Turned into an ambulance. * Truck ‚Äì helped free Stron-Domez‚Äô captive workforce in Birmingham, but was seemingly destroyed battling Casmodon in London. Turned into a semi-trailer truck. * Night Ranger ‚Äì fitted with silent running technology, Night Ranger infiltrated Stron-Domez‚Äô factory in Birmingham, but was destroyed in the battle with Casmodon in London. Turned into a Harley Davidson Electra Glide motorcycle. * Turbo ‚Äì a brave, loyal Robo Machine, he was involved in the battle with Casmodon, and his persistent efforts enabled him to save Dozer. Turned into a sports car. * Scooter ‚Äì the Security Forces‚Äô courier, Scooter was weak but courageous, and followed Leader-One's forces into battle in London despite being ordered to stay behind with Charlie. Transforms into a scooter. * Carry-All ‚Äì A capable fighter, Carry-All was dispatched with Royal-T to fend off Zod when the Command Centre was attacked. He accidentally came across Cy-Kill and Zod while trying to re- establish contact with the Command Centre, and was mortally wounded by Zod. However, he was able to signal the Security Forces before dying. Transforms into a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter. * Royal-T ‚Äì Along with Carry-All, Royal-T attempted to intercept Zod over London, but was shot down. Badly wounded, he was helped to safety by Carry-All, but presumably expired when his comrade was killed before he could return with a fresh fuel supply. Renegade Robo Machines * Zod ‚Äì In the shooting down Royal-T, and later killing Carry-All. Zod still possessed the intellect of Stron-Domez, and was able to design the Devil Invaders, and oversee construction of the first, Casmodon. However, soon after his stabilisers were disabled after being attacked by the Security Forces, and Cy-Kill abandoned him. * Cy-Kill ‚Äì a petty criminal chosen by Stron-Domez for his experiments, Cy-Kill's ambitions quickly grew, and by the end of the second arc he seemed to have struck out on his own, choosing to help Casmodon battle the Security Forces in London rather than attend to the damaged Zod. The only one of Stron-Domez‚Äô original creations to avoid capture at the end of the first arc. Turned into a motorcycle. * Tank ‚Äì another petty criminal recruited and converted by Stron-Domez, Tank was rather stupid, for instance being tricked by a human into battling Cy-Kill in Cholkham. He was subsequently injured in a skirmish with the Security Forces outside the town, and then again at the Birmingham factory, courtesy of Night Ranger. He was then captured and deactivated by the Security Forces. Presumably his body remains in the Command Centre. Turned into a battle tank. * Fitor ‚Äì created by Stron-Domez on the journey to Earth, he participated in the attack on Cholkham, but was captured and deactivated after the battle in Birmingham. Presumably his body remains in the Command Centre. Turned into a jet fighter. * Cop-Tur ‚Äì created on Earth by Stron-Domez, and aided in the capture of the factory in Birmingham. Soon afterwards he was captured and deactivated by the Security Forces. Presumably his body remains in the Command Centre. Turned into a helicopter. * Loco ‚Äì the only Robo Machine Stron-Domez was able to build in Birmingham before the Security Forces arrived, Loco suffered two defeats from Truck in his short life before he was captured and deactivated. Presumably his body remains in the Command Centre. Turned into a steam train. * Casmodon ‚Äì the first Devil Invader built by Zod, and the only one completed. Casmodon was the biggest Robo Machine yet, and possessed a huge amount of power. He took on most of the Security Forces on the outskirts of London, destroying Night Ranger and (probably) Truck, injuring Dozer and forcing them to withdraw. However, he could not follow them as Charlie had disabled some of his circuits. Turned into a flying car.

She is the founding mainstay lead singer, guitarist and songwriter of the Falling Joys, an alternative rock band formed in Canberra. She has issued two solo albums, Soon Will Be Tomorrow (collaboration with Conway Savage, June 1998) and Song of Habit (October 2001).  Biography = Early life  Suzie Higgie is the daughter of William Alexander \\"Bill\\" Higgie (19232015), a Department of Immigration diplomat, and Jean Winifred n√©e Stenhouse, from the same department. Her older brother, Mark Higgie, is a diplomat, political advisor and former intelligence analyst. Her younger sister, Jenny Higgie, is a novelist, screenwriter, art critic and co-editor of the London-based contemporary arts magazine, Frieze. Her younger brother, Andrew Higgie, is a London-based theatre and TV producer. After Higgie attended a boarding school in England, the family relocated successively to Yugoslavia, Italy, France and back to Australia. In Canberra she completed her degree in communication and history before working short terms in an Israeli kibbutz and an Austrian ski resort. Back in Canberra, Higgie and Jenny were members of a folk-pop group, Get Set Go, from mid-1983 to mid-1984, with Nic Dalton and Anthony Hayes (later known as Stevie Plunder). Higgie later recalled, \\"[d]own at Commonwealth Park there used to be a tunnel with a power point ... My first band with Nic Dalton and Stevie Plunder... we wrote most of our songs down there.\\"  Falling Joys era  In 1985 Higgie, as lead singer and guitarist, formed Falling Joys, an indie guitar pop group, in Canberra, with Anthony Merrilees on drums; Robin Miles on keyboards and vocals; and Stuart G. Robertson on bass guitar and vocals. Late that year Higgie and Robertson were joined by Ken Doll on drums and the trio played their last Canberra gig before relocating to Sydney in April of the following year. Their debut single, \\"Burnt so Low\\", appeared in January 1987, which was co-written by Higgie and Robertson. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' or 'Performer:' Falling Joys' debut extended play, Omega, appeared in November 1989. Penelope Layland of The Canberra Times observed, \\"A tempting four-track EP from [the band]. Recent line up changes do not appear to have had a radical effect on the music, which is still dominated by the vocals and song-writing of Suzie Higgie.\\" According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, the group's recent singles and the EP, \\"gained the band many new fans. Higgie's breathy vocals on these records were just one of the band's trademark sounds.\\" One of their singles, \\"Jennifer\\", appeared in April 1991 with a five-track EP version also available. The title track is dedicated to Higgie's sister, Jennifer Higgie. A live version also appeared as Jennifer ‚Äì The Live EP, which reached the top 60 on the ARIA Singles Chart in September. The group issued three studio albums, Wish List (November 1990), Psychohum (May 1992) and Aerial (August 1993), before disbanding in 1995. Higgie has participated in reformations of the group, including touring in February and June 2011 and early July 2016. In November 2017 Falling Joys reunited for an Australian tour.  Solo works  Higgie's first solo album, Soon Will Be Tomorrow, is a collaboration with Conway Savage (from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds). She had started work on the \\"low-key and low-fi album of soft-hued country'n'blues tunes\\" in 1996, which was released in June 1998 via Anchor & Hope/Shock Records. Higgie provided lead vocals, guitar and bass guitar; while Savage played piano, organ and keyboards as well as singing. It was recorded by Matt Crosbie at Exeter House, Mount Victoria and co-produced by Higgie and Crosbie. McFarlane described how, \\"To promote this album of sparse folk/pop tunes and quiet love songs, Higgie and Savage undertook a low-key tour.\\" The singer- songwriter later recalled, \\"I wanted to do something really, you know, laid back... I had a few songs that I'd already written, and because my partner Matt [Crosbie], he's been Nick Cave's live engineer for over twenty years, so I'd got to know the guys through him, I heard Conway [Savage]'s piano playing and got to know his stuff he did and I thought, 'That's something different, let's get together with Conway, if he's interested.'‚Ä¶ And that's pretty much how it came about.\\" Songs of Habit (October 2001) is Higgie's second album. According to Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald, \\"[it] began life as a series of titles in search of songs. Wanting to challenge herself, she decided to try writing a concept album, loosely based around habits (nuns' habits, drug habits, unconscious and involuntary habits)... There are folk, country and soul echoes, even a hint of lounge music. There are electronic and acoustic songs. But mostly, it's just a collection of tender, warm melodies, the kind of record that is perfectly out of step with everything fashionable in pop and all the richer for it.\\" AllMusic's Richie Unterberger opined, \\"[its] music suggestive of the moods of those between relationships, keeping pretty much to themselves as they drift through the day in relative reclusion, then sitting alone in smoky bars and clubs at night.\\" Soon Will Be Tomorrow was re-released in April 2012: Higgie and Savage performed the album live in concert.  Private life  Higgie's domestic partner, Matt Crosbie, was the front-of-house audio engineer for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and they have two children. They lived in Mount Victoria, then Bowral and moved from there to the United Kingdom in 2000. Higgie, Crosbie and children returned to Bowral in mid-2009. By November 2017 the couple had divorced and Higgie was living in Canberra working at the National Museum ‚Äì she \\"designs music workshops for people with mixed abilities, whether that involves preschool children or aged Alzheimer's disease sufferers.\\" Her niece, Anna Higgie, is a Bristol-based illustrator and street artist.

Grebe pronounced Gree-bee (1895-October 24, 1935) was a pioneer in the radio broadcasting field. Grebe in 1924. He was born in Richmond Hill in the borough of Queens, in New York City. At the age of 9 he was given a radio set by his father, and soon came to be such an expert that his science teacher at Public School 88 in Jamaica said Alfred knew more than he did. From public school, he went to a training school in Jamaica, and a commercial radio school in Manhattan, New York City, where he conducted his own experiments. By age 15, he became a licensed commercial operator, and went to work as a ship's radio operator. After three years onboard (during which time he traveled as far as India) he returned to Long Island, where the first commercial station on the island was being built at Sayville. He got a job as an operator there. Later, because there was currently a radio craze, some friends had him make receivers for them. After making a few sets, he decided to go into commercial production. In 1914 he issued his first catalog, and set up a factory in Richmond Hill on the same property where his home was located, which soon became able to produce all the components needed to assemble a radio, and which contained research laboratories as well. By 1922 he tore down his home to build a larger factory on the site. To stimulate public interest, he set up several radio stations: one (WAHG) was identified with his own initials; another (WBOQ) had call letters standing for Borough of Queens. (His WAHG is, through several call letter changes, now WCBS, still a major radio station in New York City.) He set up a broadcasting company called the \\"Atlantic Broadcasting Corporation\\" (changing WAHG to WABC on November 1, 1926) which operated his stations until he sold them to CBS in January 1929. Grebe's publicity manager, Bill Schudt, Jr., stayed with CBS after the sale of WABC. When television station W2XAB began experiments in 1931, Schudt became CBS' first television director. He retired from the network in 1966 as director of affiliate relations. Alfred Grebe's manufacturing company, A. H. Grebe and Co. Inc., was renamed Grebe Radio and Television Corporation and moved from Richmond Hill to Manhattan in 1933. In 1935 Grebe underwent a stomach operation at Post-Graduate Hospital in Manhattan. He became ill after the operation and died after 10 days. In 2017, Grebe was honored as \\"The Father of NewsRadio880\\" during a series commemorating the 50th anniversary of WCBS going all news.

She first appeared in 2002 and made her final appearance in 2005. Storylines The eldest Hunter child was a runaway living in Ibiza for two years without contacting her family before returning, not out of love, but rather because she had run out of money. She was a man-eater and was responsible for the spread of an STD that Jamie Nash got the blame for. She often caused trouble for her family and often went against her mother's wishes. When she arrived on town, she discovered that her little brother Lee was always getting in trouble with the police and school, and failed exams, and Lisa self-harmed after she was bullied by Steph Dean, while Dan was depressed because she ran away from home. She married Toby Mills, who her family approved of, but this was a huge mistake, as he was in fact a serial killer. Ellie ran off again, and Toby and Dan went off to look for her, but the night ended in disaster when Toby died, Ellie was left unconscious after falling from a roof and Dan was in the frame for his murder. The Hunter clan desperately awaited for Ellie to wake up to clear Dan's name, but on waking, she had lost her memory and accused Dan of murdering her husband. Her family turned against her, including her father, and Ellie also incurred the wrath of Les's close friend and business partner Johnno Dean and his then-wife Frankie Osborne, whose daughters Steph and Debbie had their lives ruined by Toby, Steph nearly lost her life after being attacked by Toby and was left with epilepsy as a result of the attack; and Debbie, who had been in a relationship with Dan, having lost her boyfriend due to his wrongful imprisonment. Ellie's actions led to an explosive confrontation with Johnno Dean, and Les had to step in and prevent his business partner from physically attacking Ellie. The atmosphere in the Hunter household was too much and Sally disowned her daughter. Ellie's memory eventually returned and Dan was cleared, but her mother was unable to forgive her. Dan refused to forgive her, and after he died, Sally made it clear that she was no longer a part of the family and said she wished that Ellie had died instead of Dan. Ellie continued to live with the family, but tensions flared up yet again when she needed tuition money and asked Sally if she could get back some of the money she'd given to help Dan start the Pit Stop. An angry Sally gave her a cheque for all the money, further alienating Ellie from her mother and siblings. Les had moved away due to Dan's death and the family strife and Sally decided to look for him. When Lee and Lisa decided to go and find their parents, Ellie wanted to go along, but they refused, telling her once and for all that she didn't fit in. While they were all gone, Ellie had a drink with Russ Owen and Dannii Carbone and realised she had nothing left in Chester. She packed her bags and watched a few old family videos from when she and Dan were kids. Full of remorse, she left a goodbye letter and the ripped- up cheque from Sally. After taking one last look around the family home, she left. When the Hunters returned to find her missing, they initially rowed over who was responsible for her leaving and whether she just wanted to hurt them yet again. Bombhead convinced them she was just trying to do what she thought they wanted and that they should be happy. They sent Ellie an e-mail, telling her they loved her and do care for her and to contact them any time she wanted. Sally later told her husband and her children that Ellie is now living in France, finishing her schooling and having found work.

This portion of the street, between University Avenue and Hamilton Avenue, is a highly distinctive business block. It showcases the Spanish Colonial and Early California styles with gentle archways, wrought iron work, tile roofs of varying heights and courtyards. The development of Ramona Street, named after the 1884 novel Ramona, was an early successful attempt to expand laterally the central commercial district. Pedro de Lemos, a craftsman, graphic artist and curator of the Stanford Museum had been concerned with the larger scale and somewhat linear development along University Avenue. He believed that an informal architecture full of whimsy and integrated with nature was indeed compatible with commercial businesses. The first building to go up, in 1925, was the Gotham Shop at 520 Ramona, built by de Lemos, who had bought the property to preserve a very old oak tree (finally removed in the 1980s). He designed the building around the venerable oak and created shops with rustic benches, ceramic tiles and stucco walls. In 1938, de Lemos built another Spanish Colonial Revival commercial office building across the street at 533 - 539 Ramona, with a recessed arched entrance, an interior patio, wrought iron and more tiles. Noted local architects Birge Clark, W. H. Weeks and others added to the Spanish flavor of what de Lemos started. In 1928, Clark designed the multistory Medico-Dental Building at Hamilton and Ramona, which now houses the University Art Center on the ground floor. Across Ramona, Weeks designed the Cardinal Hotel, Palo Alto's first non-frame hotel. Excitement attended the Cardinal's debut, for it became the scene of tea dances and balls. The hotel had another purpose; it was intended to help make Hamilton a commercial street. The unified aspect of the 500 Ramona Street block was recognized by its designation in 1985 as a Historic District in the National Register of Historic Places. Since then, Plaza Ramona and other remodelings at the University Avenue end of the block have enhanced the theme.

Russian President Putin in a Moscow Religion Conference, where Ayatollah Taskhiri represented the Muslim world, qualified the efforts of the later as cornerstone.

He was a member of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, providing piano, organ and backing vocals from 1990. From 1993, Savage had a solo career and released albums, Nothing Broken (2000), Wrong Man's Hands (2004) and Rare Songs & Performances 1989‚Äì2004. He also collaborated with other artists for their albums, such as Soon Will Be Tomorrow (with Suzie Higgie, 1998) and Quickie for Ducky (with Amanda Fox and Robert Tickner, 2007). Biography Conway Victor Savage was born on 27 July 1960 and grew up in country Victoria where his parents were publicans. His brother, Frank Savage, is a part-time rock music cabaret singer and builder. His niece, Cash Savage, is the lead singer of the band Cash Savage and the Last Drinks. Savage began playing piano in his early teens in the dining room of one of the pubs his parents owned. He later recalled \\"I just really enjoyed it ... I could just sit down and play it and play it ‚Äì it's a beautiful relaxation, until this day. But it wasn't like I was playing in the pub for nickels and dimes or anything. I was really embarrassed about it and I kept it pretty quiet\\". From 1980 to 1981, Savage was on piano and backing vocals in Happy Orphans, with Jim White on drums. He was also in Scrap Museum over a similar time period. From 1982 to 1986 he was in a country music band, The Feral Dinosaurs, again with White. Other members of that group were Nick Danyi on saxophone and vocals; Dave Last on double bass and vocals; and Jim Shugg on guitar (ex-People with Chairs up Their Noses). The group issued a track, \\"Blue Day\\", on a various artists' compilation album, Asleep at the Wheel (1984). A single, \\"Ramblin' Man\\", followed before they released an extended play, You've all Got a Home to Go To, in December 1985. Also in the 1980s he played in the Melbourne-based country-rock band, Dust on the Bible, with his sister-in-law Jane (Frank's wife) as lead vocalist. In 1988, with Last, he formed Dave Last and The Legendary Boy Kings, which included Bruce Kane on drums; Manny Markogiannakos on guitar; and Shane Walsh on bass. Savage joined Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1990 on piano, organ and backing vocals to promote their sixth album, The Good Son (April 1990). He has since appeared on their studio albums including Henry's Dream (April 1992), Let Love In (April 1994), Murder Ballads (February 1996), The Boatman's Call (March 1997), No More Shall We Part (April 2001) and Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus (September 2004). In October 1995 Conway contributed lead vocals for \\"The Willow Garden\\", a B-side of the single, \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\". Due to the overall minimal piano parts on the band's fourteenth release, Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! (March 2008), Conway was used on backing vocals and hand claps. Through the late 1980s and into the 1990s, he also guested on albums and singles for various fellow Australian musicians, including Kim Salmon, Dave Graney (My Life on the Plain, 1989), David McComb (The Message EP, 1991), Spencer P. Jones (Rumour of Death, 1994), and Robert Forster (I Had a New York Girlfriend, 1995). Savage started to record his own solo material from late 1992, when he released a self-titled four-track EP. He provided lead vocals, piano and organ; and was assisted by fellow Bad Seeds members: Martyn P. Casey on bass guitar; and Mick Harvey on drums, guitar and backing vocals. In late 1995, he linked up with singer-songwriter-guitarist Suzie Higgie (of Falling Joys) for the collaborative album Soon Will Be Tomorrow. It was produced by Higgie's husband Matt Crosbie. Its release was delayed until after Falling Joys disbanded and appeared in June 1998 on Anchor & Hope, distributed by Shock Records. Liz Armitage of The Canberra Times described the album as an \\"almost country-medieval record\\". Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane felt it was \\"a low-key and low-fi album of soft- hued country 'n' blues tunes\\" containing \\"sparse folk/pop tunes and quiet love songs\\". The duo toured to promote the album. Savage released his debut full- length album Nothing Broken on his own label, Beheaded Communications, in 2000. He used Casey and Harvey; together with Charlie Owen on banjo and guitars (acoustic and electric); and Tony Wyzenbeek on harmonica. It was co- produced by Savage and his engineer, Dave McCluney. The musicians were recorded without Savage's vocals, which were added later, but just a piano guide track. A reviewer at 16horsepower.com felt \\"This somewhat blindfolded approach to the songs, results in a fresh, impromptu feel to this stately, contemplative album. Spontaneity has always been an essential element in the recording process for Savage, and this daring approach is vindicated once more\\". In August 2002 it was re-released in Europe by Cargo Records. Savage's next solo album Wrong Man's Hands, released in 2004, was recorded from late 2003 to early the next year on an 8-track in a room above the Union Club Hotel, Fitzroy, with members of Melbourne band The Stream, Amanda Fox and Robert Tickner. He admitted that he used a little James Joyce in one of his lyrics \\"but please don‚Äôt sue me...I probably owe you the price of a cup of coffee...some of his words drifted into my imagination with the songs and next thing they ‚Äì they just fitted like a glove and I just went with it\\". Savage's 2005 compilation album Rare Songs & Performances 1989‚Äì2004 traced his various studio and live material recorded in Australia and Europe. Guest musicians include Casey, Fox, Harvey, Jones, Tickner, and White. Savage, Fox and Tickner issued a collaborative album Quickie for Duckie in 2007, which was followed by Savage's solo effort Live in Ireland the next year. It had been recorded live at the Glens Centre Manorhamilton, Leitrim on 18 October 2008. NMEs Edwin McFee noted that Savage's vocals are \\"a bit like sand and glue. He may not be blessed with the purest set of pipes, but his quivering, piano-led renditions of songs from his last four albums frame his ragged, whiskey-soaked vocals perfectly\\". In 2010, Savage, Fox and Tickner issued the six-track EP Pussy's Bow, which had been recorded in Ireland's Tumbleweed Studios in Dundalk in the previous August. Recording engineers were Derek Turner and Jason Varley; while Savage supplied lead vocals, piano and keyboards; Fox was on organ, accordion, percussion and backing vocals; and Tickner delivered guitars and backing vocals. I-94 Bar's Barman reviewed the EP \\"If, like me, you think of him principally as Nick Cave's piano player, then you need to take a deeper dive ... [it] blows away some of the preconceptions of him as solely a country artist or (gasp) a Goth ... [it] is nothing but a record of contrasting moods. And a very good one\\". Savage underwent medical treatment for a brain tumour in 2017. He died, aged 58, on 2 September 2018. Ghosteen (2019), the Bad Seeds' seventeenth album, was dedicated to Savage.

He was Lebanon's representative at the Francophonie. Then he became director general of the information ministry in 1967. From 1978 to 1983 he served as the head of the state television station Tele Liban. At the beginning of 2005, Rizk was appointed information minister. In July 2005, then Prime Minister Fouad Siniora controversially appointed Rizk as justice minister, a post claimed by Michel Aoun and also by Saad Hariri. The appointment of Rizk, a man close to president Lahoud, was opposed as it was felt that the investigation into the murder of Rafik Hariri would be unlikely to be pursued vigorously by a pro-Lahoud minister. Rizk silenced critics by giving the investigation under UNIIIC-Commissioner Detlev Mehlis his full support while later on he became an outspoken critic of Mehlis' successor Serge Brammertz because of his alleged inactivity in the ongoing investigation. Rizk's term as justice minister lasted until July 2008. He was not appointed to the national unity government headed by Fouad Siniora and was replaced by Ibrahim Najjar.

Rated at 300 shp (224 kW) at take-off power, the RR300 is a rebadged and downrated variant of the Rolls-Royce Model 250-C20. Design and development The Model 250-C18 certified in 1965 was rated at a similar power level to that of the RR300, but over the last forty years subsequent sub-models have become more efficient and produce substantially more power. For instance the Model 250-C40, with an overall pressure ratio of 9.2:1 at an airflow 6.1 lb/s, develops 715 shp. The RR300 mates a scaled-down centrifugal compressor from the Model 250-C40/47 to a combustor and turbine similar to that of the Model 250-C20, replacing the C20's complex six-stage axial/single-stage centrifugal compressor. The RR300 retains the look and layout of the Model 250 from which it is derived.FAA TCDS The RR300 is the second attempt to develop a lower-rated version of the Model 250-C20, coming 20 years after the 350 shp Allison Model 225 of 1987. The five-seat Robinson R66 light helicopter features the RR300 as a turboshaft engine, Robinson having originally intended on utilizing the standard Model 250-C20. Rolls- Royce has also announced the signing of Memorandums of Understanding with Enstrom, MD Helicopters, RotorWay and Schweizer to discuss future applications of the RR300. In March 2013, the engine was named as the power plant for the new Scott's Bell 47GT-6. The 47GT-6 will be based upon the 47G-3B-2A type design and produced by Scott's Bell 47, the current holder of the Bell 47 type certificate.

Hutchinson ran for mayor in 2005, defeating city council member Bill Bertschy, Libertarian Mark Brophy, and high-school teacher Scott VanTatenhove. During his campaign, he was the beneficiary of support from the Fort Collins Chamber of Commerce in their first endeavor supporting local candidates.

It was built in the second half of the 12th century, and is distinguished by its two sculpted portals. The surrounding graveyard contains a number of funeral chapels, most notably the Totenkapelle, which is decorated with a cycle of paintings depicting the Totentanz (Dance of the Dead) by the Rococo artist Felix H√∂zl. Location View of St. Peter's, ca. 1860 St. Peter's is located on the southern bank of the Danube river in the Altstadt of Straubing, approximately one kilometer to the east of the present city center. It sits on top of a small elevation, and the graveyard, church, and chapels are enclosed by a wall. History The present church is at least the second to have stood on the site: excavations conducted in 1974 revealed the presence of an earlier Carolingian hall church. The present church was built around 1200, shortly before the removal of Straubing's main market to a site well to the west (the present-day Neustadt). St. Peter's remained, however, the only rectory in Straubing until 1492, when the Church of St. Jakob was built in the Neustadt. The church was redecorated in a Baroque style sometime before 1696, and an onion-dome was set atop the south-western tower. The Baroque decoration and onion dome were removed in 1866/67 in the course of a historicizing \\"purification\\" of the structure.Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 2-3; Strobel and Weis, Romanik, 191-93. In 1885 the north-western tower, which had previously been only three storeys high, was raised to the height of the south-western tower.Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 6. The most recent restoration was undertaken in 1977/78, at which time the nave was provided with a wooden roof.Strobel and Weis, Romanik, 193. Structure The west portal St. Peter's is a three-aisled pillar basilica with three apses, and a two-towered western facade. The arcades between the side aisles and the nave rest on rectangular masonry pillars, whose decoration is not original to the building, but was added in the course of the 19th-century restorations.Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 3. Two portals provide access to the building, one from the west and one from the south. The tympanum of the west portal portrays a knight, armed with sword and shield, battling a dragon. The head of a man, whom the dragon has swallowed, is visible between its jaws. The representation may allude to the words of Psalm 35/34: > Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. Draw out also > the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my > soul, I am thy salvation.vv. 2-3, KJV The scene would therefore have Christological significance, with the words of the Psalm understood typologically to refer to Christ as a warrior against evil.Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 3-6; Strobel and Weis, Romanik, 195. The south portal. The south portal is somewhat more mysterious. It portrays two animals, at left perhaps a griffinStrobel and Weis, Romanik, 195. or another dragon,Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 6. and at right a lion. The two beasts may likewise be engaged in battle.Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 6. An opposition between good and evil, similar to that on the west portal, is likely intended, perhaps with reference to medieval animal stories such as those found in the Physiologus.Strobel and Weis, Romanik, 195. Chapels The Totenkapelle The graveyard surrounding St. Peter's includes three free- standing chapels: a Kapelle Unserer Lieben Frau (Chapel of Our Dear Lady), perhaps originally Romanesque, with a 15th-century ossuary;Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 8; Strobel and Weis, Romanik, 191. the Agnes-Bernauer-Kapelle, the burial place of the like-named secret wife of Albert III of Bavaria, executed on charges of witchcraft;Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche, 10-12. and the Totenkapelle (Chapel of the Dead), built in 1486.Schnell and Utz, Pfarrkirche,14. The latter is perhaps of the greatest artistic significance, on account of its extensive cycle of paintings representing the Totentanz (Dance of the Dead), created by the Rococo artist Felix H√∂zl (died 1774), a resident of Straubing, in 1763. The cycle is of note as an 18th-century treatment of a predominantly medieval theme.Huber, Totentanz, passim.

Taylor Science & Technology Academy is a comprehensive college preparatory magnet school. In August 2004, the school opened with 7th and 8th grades and has grown to include 6th through 12th grades in recent years. PFTSTA is located in Avondale, Louisiana. Named after Patrick F. Taylor, this Sci-tech school currently has grades 6-12. The students are on a block schedule, four separate 90 minute (an hour and a half) courses a day that changes the following semester. The school campus is now located in a new facility on the Westbank in Avondale by the Alario Center, and each student is issued a school laptop on which to do classwork, projects, and homework. The school's current principal is Sharmeika Daniels.  History  The school was started in 2002 as a half day specialty school called Jefferson Parish School for Science and Technology (JPSST). Students attending public schools in the parish would enroll in JPSST - they would attend their home-based school half a day and JPSST half a day - they were transported between their home-based school and JPSST by bus daily to attend either the morning or afternoon session (morning transportation there or afternoon transportation home were arranged or provided by students' parents). Starting off with only two grades (7th and 8th), the school soon became a full day magnet school by the 2005-2006 school year and was renamed Patrick F. Taylor Science and Technology Academy (PFTSTA), after Patrick F. Taylor, an oil business tycoon famous for creating the TOPS program (which helps pays college tuition for students who attain a minimum GPA and ACT score). Patrick Taylor's widow, Ms. Taylor, continues to play a close role in the development of the school. At the time, the school included 6th - 9th grade and was located in the Jefferson Parish Public School System special services building, occupying the entire second floor of the building. On August 29, 2005, only a few weeks into the school year, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, causing evacuations and New Orleans school closures. Students were able to keep in touch with their teachers and one another via internet using the discussion forums set up on the school's eBoard. The rest of the 2005-2006 school year continued with a smaller number of students, but still successfully. For the 2006-2007 school year, PFTSTA moved to its own building in Jefferson, Louisiana, only a few blocks away from the Parish School Headquarters building. The school moved into what was previously Deckbar Elementary. The larger complex included three classroom buildings, a cafeteria building, and a smaller building used as a computer lab. The oldest building was built in the 1920s. With each new year, the school was getting progressively bigger as each new grade was added. At this point, PFTSTA grades 8 - 10 and about 115 students. A 6th grade was added in 2007. The 2008-2009 school year was the first year in which Patrick Taylor had a full school. PFTSTA's 220 students prepared to say goodbye to its first graduating class. The commencement ceremony took place at the Alario Center, on the West Bank of Jefferson Parish. In 2011, PFTSTA's name was changed to Patrick F. Taylor Science and Technology Regional Academy (PFTSTRA) to further clarify the role the school plays in Southeastern Louisiana; however, the new name is not widely used in informal speech. That same year, the federal government awarded Taylor Academy the Blue Ribbon Award for Scholastic achievement, one of the highest honors a public school can receive. Several traditions have been started at Patrick Taylor Academy which are celebrated by the students and faculty. These include Founder's Day, a celebration of Mr. Taylor and the work he did to proliferate education in Louisiana. Ms. Taylor attends the event, and students put on performances, eat food, and sing the alma mater together.  Work and grades  Patrick Taylor is a Jefferson Parish specialty school; the students have to apply to the school and exhibit certain behavior and grades in order to be accepted. Test scores from the March previous to application are to be viewed as well as their final report cards from last year, the year before, and the year the student is in, in order to be accepted into PFTSTA.  Clubs and electives  Patrick Taylor has a diverse group of clubs and electives. Two electives are picked for grades eighth and up. Clubs are extracurricular and have meetings during lunch or after school. If you want to be challenged in school, you can always apply to go. It is not guaranteed that you will be accepted.  Electives  *Fine Arts Survey - The history of art from prehistoric times to modern art. *Computer Science - How computers work. *Web Mastery - Become a master of HTML. *Journalism - Interview and write articles for the year book, newsletter and other publications. *Pre-engineering - Science of Technology / Design and Modeling. *IED - Introduction to Engineering Design (CAD with Inventor). *Spanish - A study of the Spanish language.

The sanctuary is part of the Brevard County Environmentally Endangered Lands (EEL) program. It has 1.85 miles (3 km) of boardwalk paths and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of jogging trails through native forest to Turkey Creek, an excellent site for seeing birds, turtles, manatees, alligators as well as other local wildlife; there is a canoe deck on the creek. The creek is an important breeding ground for both salt and fresh water fish. The Sanctuary is part of the East Florida section of the Great Florida Birding Trail. The property was donated to the Florida Audubon Society and the city of Palm Bay in 1978, and fundraising to conserve the area began in 1981. By 1994 was under the protection of the voluntary management committee. The park is open daily, from 7am to sunset. It occasionally is threatened by environmental concerns. Heavy rains in September 2014 caused partially treated wastewater to spill into Turkey Creek.

On Demand, previously called Sky Anytime, has been available in various forms including: a PC version using a peer-to-peer platform over broadband Internet connection, a version for users of 3G mobile telephones, a push video on demand service for subscribers equipped with a Sky+ HD set-top box or the PVR3 version of the Sky+ set top box and a pull video-on-demand service. Sky no longer use the \\"On Demand\\" brand for their current Sky TV on demand services on Sky Q, Sky Go and Sky+HD. History On 27 March 2007, Sky launched its Sky Anytime service for owners of Sky HD set top boxes. The service is a Push video on demand (push VoD) system similar to Top Up TV's TV Favourites, where the Sky+ PVR automatically records programmes transmitted over-night. The service uses 140GB of previously reserved disk space on Sky+ HD boxes hard- disk space whilst on standard Sky+ boxes it uses 80GB of the hard-disk space. The service is intended to provide a catch-up of a selection of the last week's programming. The service was launched on PVR3 Sky+ boxes manufactured by Pace and Amstrad on 24 April 2007. The update for Thomson boxes was delayed because of technical difficulties, it was finally launched for Thomson boxes on 29 May 2007. On 30 July 2009, Sky confirmed the launch of a 'pull' video- on-demand service for 2010, adding to the Sky Anytime 'push' VOD service. On 29 April 2010, Sky revealed that it will name its video-on-demand service Sky Anytime+. \\"It will be a broad offering at launch with a large range of content across the range of content that we show,\\" CEO Jeremy Darroch said. \\"(It will feature) progressive download using the broadband return pathway and the hard disk in a combined way. All of the boxes are VOD-ready, so we'll be able to roll it out to all of the box population.\\" Sky Anytime+ began a staggered roll out from 26 October 2010, The majority of Sky's customers were able to receive the service by the end of 2010. In the phased rollout, all remaining receivers were enabled in the first part of 2011. A background over-the-air update in 2010 upgraded all existing Sky+ HD boxes with the software needed to run Anytime+. In July 2011, Sky Anytime was added to Virgin Media with content from Sky Living, following on from Sky's purchase of Virgin Media Television. Additional content began rolling out on 11 October 2011 ahead of a full launch the following day. Programming is available in both standard and high definition from Sky1, Sky Arts, Sky Living, Sky Movies, Sky News and Sky Sports. However HD content from premium channels is limited to TiVo subscribers. Sky Anytime content also became available through Virgin Media Player online on 28 October 2011 but not on mobile devices. On 6 September 2012, Sky announced that Sky Anytime and Anytime+ would be merged and rebranded as On Demand, along with the addition of a Catch-up TV section. This occurred on 26 September 2012, with Sky Anytime becoming a Showcase section and Sky Anytime+ being split into Library, Movies and Sky Store, all on the Sky Guide of the satellite receivers. On 11 October 2012, the download component of the on Demand service was activated in Ireland, where Anytime+ had previously been unavailable. Sky no longer uses the \\"On Demand\\" brand name for their on demand services. Instead (as of 2019) the on demand content on Sky Q boxes are categorised on the home screen as: Catch Up TV, Sky Cinema, Sky Box Sets, Home, Sports, Kids and Music. Content Sky Anytime+ at launch. On Demand offers around 1,000 hours of content from Sky 1, Sky Atlantic, Sky Arts, Sky Living, Sky Movies and Sky Sports, along with material from other broadcasters, such as the Disney Channel, ESPN, HBO, National Geographic and UKTV. A \\"key focus\\" for the service is movies, with around 500 made available at the launch of Sky Anytime+. On Demand is offered without charge to all Sky customers with Sky+ HD boxes, although access to premium content such as sport and movies will depend on the subscriber's package. All Anytime+ content was initially only available in standard definition, with high definition VOD content via Sky Anytime. However, Sky's head of TV services Kathryn Downward said that Anytime+ could offer HD content in the future and 3D on-demand was \\"definitely something we are considering\\" and HD content was later made available. So far, more HD content has been added from both Sky and the BBC. On 1 September 2011, a further 10 channels were added to the service. ITV Player became accessible through the main Sky Anytime+ menu as well as a dedicated ITV Player section on 31 January 2012, featuring archive content. The catch-up TV section of on Demand launched on 26 September 2012, featuring ITV Player, Demand 5, Sky TV (Sky1, Sky Arts, Sky Atlantic and Sky Living), Sky Sports and Sky Movies. BBC iPlayer arrived on 30 October 2012, while 4oD launched on 18 March 2013. Downloads Download content in on Demand is supported by progressive download, meaning it downloads in the background while the user is watching. Standard definition movies are typically around 1.3GBs, which takes about one minute to start playing on 2Mbit/s+ connections, but around 40mins on sub-1Mbit/s lines. Downloads can also be paused if the user wants to free up their broadband line for another task. However, Anytime+ was initially only made available to Sky customers with a Sky Broadband connection, meaning anyone on another internet service provider missed out. Downward said that the reasoning behind this strategy is to enable the \\"optimum experience\\" for customers and make it easier to manage technical issues. On 20 March 2012, Sky Anytime+ was made available across all broadband providers. Content requiring a download is managed in the existing Sky+ Planner tool. Users are able to trigger multiple downloads of content at one time, which all funnels into the Planner. The system handles one download at a time, with users able to shuffle their download list to prioritise different content. If users are watching Sky television, then the system also pops up a reminder to indicate when selected content is available to watch. Among notable new features on the user interface is a 'play' icon, which indicates that content is available to play immediately. However, any content not carrying the 'play' icon will require time to download before running entirely without buffering. A Wi-Fi adapter has also been made available, manufactured by Netgear, rebadged by Sky as the \\"Sky Wireless Connector\\". Criticisms Unlike BT TV, On Demand's download content will contribute towards the user's broadband data limit. Downward said, \\"To us any internet usage is still internet usage ‚Äì however it's being delivered, if we did [differentiate between Anytime+ data and normal internet use] it could be confusing between what isn't and what is.\\" Customers who sign up for on Demand and are on the Sky Broadband Everyday Lite package are warned about how much content (180 minutes) they can consume before they hit their cap and anyone with Anytime+ that does exceed the cap is reminded that the service is contributing to their data usage. The download service was not available in Ireland upon launch but the service was made available on 11 October 2012. Sky Go Sky Go (formerly known as 'Sky Player', 'Sky Anytime on PC' and 'Sky By Broadband') was launched in January 2006. The service allows customers to download video onto their PC through a broadband internet connection. As of November 2008 the software also allows the live streaming of selected Sky TV channels. The VoD content comprises sport highlights, news, feature-length movies and TV programmes. On 6 July 2011, Sky Player and Sky Mobile TV services were merged and rebranded as Sky Go. The Big New Preview Show The Big New Preview Show was a programme shown on Sky Anytime, presented by Jason Barlow, which advertises the shows coming up on the following week. It was updated each week on a Sunday. Sky HD viewers received a slightly different programme, The Big New HD Preview Show, which showcased upcoming high definition content on both Sky Anytime on TV and the linear HD channels.

Life Her father was Johann Hohmann. She married Carl August Wilhelm Deter on May 1, 1873 and together they had one daughter. Onset of disease During the late 1890s, she started showing symptoms of dementia, such as loss of memory, delusions, and even temporary vegetative states. She would have trouble sleeping, drag sheets across the house, and scream for hours in the middle of the night. As a railway worker, Carl was unable to provide adequate care for his wife. He had her admitted to a mental institution, the Institution for the Mentally Ill and for Epileptics (Irrenschloss) in Frankfurt, Germany on 25 November 1901. There, she was examined by Dr. Alois Alzheimer. Treatment Dr. Alzheimer asked her many questions, and later asked again to see if she remembered. He told her to write her name. She tried to, but would forget the rest and repeat: \\"I have lost myself.\\" (German: \\"Ich habe mich verloren.\\") He later put her in an isolation room for a while. When he released her, she would run out screaming, \\"I will not be cut. I do not cut myself.\\" After many years, she became completely demented, muttering to herself. She died on 8 April 1906. More than a century later, her case was re-examined with modern medical technologies, where a genetic cause was found for her disease by scientists from Gie√üen and Sydney. The results were published in the journal The Lancet Neurology. According to this paper, a mutation in the PSEN1 gene was found, which alters the function of gamma secretase, and is a known cause of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, the results could not be replicated in a more recent paper published in 2014 where \\"Auguste D's DNA revealed no indication of a nonsynonymous hetero- or homozygous mutation in the exons of APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes comprising the already known familial AD mutations.\\" Alzheimer concluded that she had no sense of time or place. She could barely remember details of her life and frequently gave answers that had nothing to do with the question and were incoherent. Her moods changed rapidly between anxiety, mistrust, withdrawal and 'whininess'. They could not let her wander around the wards because she would accost other patients who would then assault her. It was not the first time that Dr. Alzheimer had seen a complete degeneration of the psyche in patients, but previously the patients had been in their seventies. Ms. Deter piqued his curiosity because she was much younger. In the weeks following, he continued to question her and record her responses. She frequently responded, \\"Oh, God!\\", and, \\"I have lost myself, so to say\\". She seemed to be consciously aware of her helplessness. Alzheimer called it the \\"Disease of Forgetfulness\\". Death and legacy In 1902, Alzheimer left the \\"Irrenschloss\\" (Castle of the Insane), as the Institution was known colloquially, to take up a position in Munich, but made frequent calls to Frankfurt inquiring about Deter's condition. On 9 April 1906, Alzheimer received a call from Frankfurt that Auguste Deter had died. He requested that her medical records and brain be sent to him. Her chart recorded that in the last years of her life, her condition had deteriorated considerably. Her death was the result of sepsis caused by an infected bedsore. On examining her brain, he found senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These would be the hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease as scientists know it today. Auguste would have been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease if seen by a current-day doctor. Rediscovery of medical record In 1996, Dr. Konrad Maurer and his colleagues, Drs. Volk and Gerbaldo, rediscovered the medical records of Auguste Deter.Deutsche Alzheimer Gesellschaft In these documents, Dr. Alzheimer had recorded his examination of his patient, including her answers to his questions: :\\"What is your name?\\" :\\"Auguste.\\" :\\"Family name?\\" :\\"Auguste.\\" :\\"What is your husband's name?\\" - she hesitates, finally answers: :\\"I believe ... Auguste.\\" :\\"Your husband?\\" :\\"Oh, no no no.\\" :\\"How old are you?\\" :\\"Fifty-one.\\" :\\"Where do you live?\\" :\\"Oh, you have been to our place.\\" :\\"Are you married?\\" :\\"Oh, I am so confused.\\" :\\"Where are you right now?\\" :\\"Here and everywhere, here and now, you must not think badly of me.\\" :\\"Where are you at the moment?\\" :\\"We will live there.\\" :\\"Where is your bed?\\" :\\"Where should it be?\\" Around midday, Frau Auguste D. ate pork and cauliflower. :\\"What are you eating?\\"''' :\\"Spinach.\\" (She was chewing meat.) :\\"What are you eating now?\\" :\\"First I eat potatoes and then horseradish.\\" :\\"Write a '5'.\\" :She writes: \\"A woman\\" :\\"Write an '8'.\\" :She writes: \\"Auguste\\" (While she is writing she repeatedly says, \\"I have lost myself, so to say.\\") ReferencesExternal links * * Who Named It? ‚Äì Alois Alzheimer * Alzheimer's: 100 years on * Alois Alzheimer's Biography.

Background A person may suffer from post vacation blues after returning home or to a normal routine from a long vacation, especially if it was a pleasurable one. The longer a trip lasts, the more intense the post vacation blues may be. This is because after the person returns home, they realize how boring and unsatisfactory their normal lifestyle routine is when compared to the activities they did while on their holiday/vacation. It is easier to overcome/adjust to a normal routine the shorter the trip was. Post vacation blues may result in tiredness, loss of appetite, strong feelings of nostalgia, and in some cases, depression. Jet lag may intensify the post vacation blues. According to an article in The Mirror, 57% of British travellers reported experiencing post-holiday blues. Treatment In general, post vacation blues will wear off over time. It usually takes a few days, but in extreme cases the mood can last for several weeks before wearing off. Faster ways of treating post vacation blues are for the person to share their experiences with family and friends, or to look at photos and souvenirs. Some may find comfort in re-living their holiday/vacation experiences; for example, if one really enjoyed jet-skiing during their holiday, they may purchase their very own jet-ski for personal use. Another well known method of curing post vacation blues is to plan or book the next vacation, this offers a distraction and also provides the person something to look forward to.

Oxford University Press US (1991) p.119 Yeats intended for the poem to state his political position on the \\"European War\\". The poem's original title, \\"To a friend who has asked me to sign his manifesto to the neutral nations,\\" appears, in the words of Jim Haughey, to have a \\"toysome evasiveness\\" regarding the politics surrounding the war. Peter McDonald suggests that the changes in the poem's title reflects Yeats's changing political positions from the beginning of the war until its end in 1919 when Yeats publishes The Wild Swans at Coole.McDonald, Peter.\\"Yeats and Remorse\\".Chatterton Lecture on Poetry: Proceedings of the British Academy94 p.179 Although there are minute variations in the wording of the version published in The Book of the Homeless and the one found in The Wild Swans at Coole, the poem's overall form remained the same even as the title changed. In the first two lines of the poem, Yeats states that it is better for a \\"poet to keep his mouth shut\\" than to enter into debates about wars and politics, feeling that a poet should speak only about traditional lyric subjects and leave the war to soldiers and politicians. Tim Kendall, in The Oxford handbook of British and Irish war poetry, suggests that Yeats's alternatives to the subject of war stated in lines 5-6, are the more traditional subjects of poetry which the poet finds suitable material, yet Kendall sees the reversion of the subject back to Yeats's generic topics as \\"self-unwriting\\". The mention of the word \\"silent\\" in the title published in Wharton's collection, appears contrary to the construction of poetry or the poetic voice.Kendall, Tim.

Similar to national identification numbers in other countries, it was used to identify people in various private transactions such as banking and employment. It was also used extensively for online identification purposes, but after 2013 resident registration number cannot be used for identification unless other laws require processing resident registration numbers. Foreigners (except those affiliated with the U.S. military) receive an alien registration number upon registration with a city office, which serves as a substitute for the \\"resident\\" registration number on their alien registration card. Every South Korean citizen within a month of their 17th birthday registers their fingerprint at the government local office and is issued the Resident Registration Card that contains their name, registration number, home address, fingerprint and picture. Components The resident registration number consists of 13 digits, with each digit providing specific information, as illustrated below:Ministry of the Interior and Safety, Ï£ºÎØºÎì±Î°ù ÏÇ¨Î¨¥Ìé∏Îûå, 2017., pp.27~28 :yymmdd-sbbbbnc * The first six digits signify the person's date of birth; for example, a person born on September 1, 1946, such as former president Roh Moo-hyun, would have 460901 as the first six digits of his RRN. * S, the seventh digit, indicates the sex and the century in which the person was born: ** 9: Males born 1800-1899 ** 0: Females born 1800-1899 ** 1: Males born 1900-1999 ** 2: Females born 1900-1999 ** 3: Males born 2000-present ** 4: Females born 2000-present ** 5: Foreign males born 1900-1999 ** 6: Foreign females born 1900-1999 ** 7: Foreign males born 2000-present ** 8: Foreign females born 2000-present * bbbb, the eighth through eleventh digits, signifies place of birth on Korean citizens' cards. In the registration numbers of foreign residents, these number indicate which agency issued the registration number. The first two b digits refer to the regional government in which the birth was registered. The final two b digits refer to the town or district's community center in which the birth was registered. Each center has a unique number assigned to it by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. The first two b digits are as follows: **Seoul - 00-08 **Busan - 09-12 **Incheon - 13-15 **Gyeonggi Province - 16-25 **Gangwon Province - 26-34 **North Chungcheong Province - 35-39 **Daejeon - 40 **South Chungcheong Province - 41-47 **Sejong City - 44, 96 **North Jeolla Province - 48-54 **South Jeolla Province - 55-66 **Gwangju - 55, 56 **Daegu - 67-69, 76 **North Gyeongsang Province - 70-75, 77-81 **South Gyeongsang Province - 82-84, 86-89, 90-92 **Ulsan - 85, 90 **Jeju Province - 93-95 * n, the 12th digit, is a sequential number used to differentiate those of the same sex born on the same day in the same location. * c, the 13th digit, is a check digit, used to verify that the number has been transcribed correctly. It is generated from the rest of the digits using the following algorithm (digits lettered a through m in order): **  Overseas permanent resident problem  Every citizen of South Korea automatically receives a resident registration number with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (indicating as a Korean citizen) when one's parents register one's birth in South Korea. Therefore, foreign born citizens of South Korea do not automatically receive a resident registration number even after they obtain their Korean passports through Korean diplomatic offices. Foreign born citizens can have resident registration numbers with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 by visiting South Korea and registering their births, but the South Korean Immigration Bureau considered foreign born citizens with overseas permanent resident status as foreigners and did not issue a resident registration number with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 to foreign born citizens with overseas permanent resident status. Since a resident registration number with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 is required to exercise rights of citizenship, citizens without a resident registration number were not guaranteed rights of citizenship except diplomatic protection. As of 2016, holders of South Korean passports with overseas residency are now eligible for a resident registration number with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 regardless of their permanent resident status. They are exempted from taxation and conscription in South Korea, but they can exercise their rights of citizenship such as voting. They still have to apply for a RRN in South Korea. Online use Many South Korean websites require users to submit a valid resident registration number to create an account. This practice ties each registered account to a unique online identity, rather than allowing anonymous registration. Since only a few large websites allow alternate means of identification (such as an alien registration number or passport number), foreigners are unable to use some of South Korean websites. The principal means of validating a resident registration number is to use an algorithm to check the last digit against what it should be based upon the rest of the digits entered (i.e. checksum verification) however this only ensures it is a valid number but does not authenticate the user. On 26 July 2011, a hacking incident of SK Communications (owner of NateOn, South Korea's most popular messenger) took place, during which about 70% of all Korean citizens' numbers were hacked. As a result, all South Korean websites were obliged to delete and are no longer allowed to use the number except for payments. The RRN has since replaced the number with identification SMS (via phone owners' information), public key certificate (requiring a visit to a bank, since PKC is stored in user's PC or personal device unlike other countries), and i-PIN, Internet Personal Identification Number, which may be obtained via registration of RRN with a governmental site. Fraud Since many South Korean websites require a valid resident registration number (RRN) in order to create an account, this presents many opportunities for identity theft and other types of fraud. For example, it was found that former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's resident registration number was used to gain access to hundreds of pornographic websites, as well as entertainment and gaming websites. Identity theft and other fraud is difficult to defeat in Korea, because each person's RRN is unchangeable, unlike other nation's identification numbers which can be changed if they are compromised (such as the United States' SSN). Complaints about identity theft led the South Korean government to implement stiff penalties for using someone else's resident registration number. Offenders may serve three years in jail or pay a ‚Ç©10,000,000 fine.

Antonio Montagnana (fl. 1730‚Äì50, born in Venice) was an Italian bass of the 18th-century who is best remembered for his association with the composer George Frideric Handel, in whose operas Montagnana sang. Montagnana's first known appearance is in 1730 at Rome, and 1731 he sang at Turin in operatic works by Nicola Porpora, thought to be his teacher: Porpora also instructed the famous castrato Farinelli. During that same year he came to London to join Handel's opera company, where he created roles in Handel's Ezio - with words by the renowned librettist Metastasio - and Sosarme, and sang in revivals of Admeto, Giulio Cesare, Flavio, and Poro. During the following season he created the role of Zoroastro in Handel's Orlando and sang the roles of Polyphemus in Acis and Galatea and Haman in Esther in what was Handel's first season of oratorio: he also took part in revivals of Tolomeo and Alessandro.Grove The part of Abner in Handel's Athalia was composed for his voice, as were the roles of the Chief Priest of Israel and Abinoam in Deborah. In 1733, however, he deserted Handel for his rival company, the Opera of the Nobility, possibly breaking a legal contract in order to do so. In this he imitated the actions of his fellow singers Senesino and Francesca Bertolli. For the Nobility, he sang in operas including those by Porpora (such as Polifemo), Johann Adolf Hasse, Giovanni Bononcini, and even one Handel opera, Ottone. In 1740 he moved to Madrid for 10 years, where he sang in many operas and many cantatas at the royal chapel. For much of the 1730s Montagnana was widely acclaimed as a remarkable singer. The parts written for him at this time display a command of a low tessitura and a vocal range of more than 2 octaves, though by 1738 - when he sang in Handel's Serse - his range had become more limited. 18th-century music historian Charles Burney praised his \\"depth, power, mellowness and peculiar accuracy of intonation in hitting distant intervals\\".

Burley was born in Falmouth, Cornwall. Before he began writing he was employed in senior management at various gas companies, but after the Second World War he obtained a scholarship to study zoology at Balliol College, Oxford. After obtaining an honours degree he became a teacher. Appointed head of biology, first at Richmond & East Sheen County Grammar School in 1953, then at Newquay Grammar School in 1955, he was well established as a writer by the time he retired, at the age of 60, in 1974. He died at his home in Holywell, Cornwall, on 15 November 2002. Works=Wycliffe *Wycliffe and the Three-Toed Pussy (1968) The villagers of Kergwyns are baffled by the bizarre shooting of an attractive local woman, the only thing stolen from the scene being her left shoe and stocking, exposing a deformity in her foot. As Wycliffe investigates, he becomes acquainted with the life of the deeply unhappy woman, who routinely manipulated the men around her. When it becomes apparent that she left clues regarding her murder embedded in crossword puzzles the detective wonders why, if she knew about her impending death, she did nothing about it. Is some powerful person carefully stagemanaging the progress of the case? *Wycliffe and How to Kill a Cat (1970) An auburn-haired young woman turns up naked and strangled in a seedy hotel room by the docks, her face savagely beaten after death. The discovery of a thousand pounds stashed underneath some clothing, and of expensive luggage indicating more class than her present surroundings, exacerbates the mystery of her murder, and Superintendent Wycliffe finds himself drawn to the investigation, interrupting his seaside holiday so that he can make inquiries of his own. *Wycliffe and the Guilt Edged Alibi (1971) Caroline Bryce causes a scandal in her home village of Treen when her dead body is dragged from the bottom of a local river. Baffled as to a possible motive for the killing of Ms Bryce, Wycliffe mulls several possibilities. Could it have been a lover's quarrel, a family feud, or perhaps even the explosion of long-held resentment of the woman? *Wycliffe and Death in a Salubrious Place (1973) In a remote corner of the Isles of Scilly the body of a young woman has been found, her skull and facial bones smashed. The locals, scared and angry, turn against Vince Peters, a famous pop star who is a newcomer. Wycliffe is not convinced of his guilt and soon scratches away at the surface of the supposedly closeknit community, exposing an undercurrent of fear and hatred. *Wycliffe and Death in Stanley Street (1974) A prostitute has been found naked and strangled in her bed in a cul-de-sac just off the main road of a sprawling port. The local police view her murder as just another sex crime, but Wycliffe isn't so sure, partly because the victim, Lily Painter, wasn't a typical \\"lady of the night\\". She enjoyed Beethoven and had a variety of degrees to her name. Wycliffe discovers that she also had shady connections with smugglers and property speculators. It takes arson and another murder before he can wrap up this case. *Wycliffe and the Pea-Green Boat (1975) Somebody has booby trapped a boat owned by Cedric Tremain's father, killing him. Following Cedric's arrest his fellow villagers are unanimous in their belief that he isn't a likely murderer. However, circumstantial evidence begins piling up. When Wycliffe arrives he finds himself believing Cedric's protestations of innocence, and soon establishes a link between the current murder and that of a young woman who, twenty years before, was supposedly strangled by a cousin of Cedric's who served fourteen years of a commuted death sentence. *Wycliffe and the Schoolgirls (1976) Two very different women, a nightclub singer and a nurse, have been strangled in their own homes, with the same efficient method, within the space of one week. Although the media and the police believe that both murders are the work of a psychopath Wycliffe believes that the solution may be a bit more complex. When another attack is suddenly aborted for no apparent reason he feels that his theory has been proved. In the course of his solo investigation he uncovers connections with an old school trip, a youth hostel and a cruel practical joke played on a lonely student. *Wycliffe and the Scapegoat (1978) Every Halloween in Cornwall a lifesized effigy of a man is rolled down the cliffs and into the sea inside a flaming wheel, as part of a pagan ritual in which the effigy has replaced what was oncea human sacrifice. This year, however, a local builder and undertaker, Jonathan Riddle, is strapped inside the blazing Ferris wheel and killed. Wycliffe's investigation proves almost as bizarre as the crime itself, with baffling new evidence and the eventual discovery of a solution stranger than anything he's ever encountered before. *Wycliffe in Paul's Court (1980) The small community of Paul's Court is shattered by the violent deaths of Willy Goppel, a German maker of dolls' houses found hanging from a beam in his home, and Yvette, a fifteen-year-old with a wild reputation found strangled, half-naked and thrown over a churchyard hedge. With the help of a local detective Wycliffe uncovers a string of antagonisms weaving across Paul's Court. *Wycliffe's Wild Goose Chase (1982) While he is taking a leisurely Sunday stroll along an estuary Wycliffe stumbles across a service revolver with one recently fired chamber and becomes embroiled in a world of shady art robberies, crooked dealers, a suspicious suicide and the hunt for a missing yacht. *Wycliffe and the Beales (1983) The Beales, a reclusive family living in Ashill House on the edge of Dartmoor, consist of Simon, an old man entirely withdrawn from active life, Nicholas and Gertrude, perpetually hitting the bottle and playing war games, and the painter Edward, who takes long walks on the moor in search of artistic inspiration. The only one with any drive or ambition is Gertrude's husband Frank Vicary, and all his time is absorbed by running the family business. When a murder rocks their local community no one has any reason to suspect one of the Beales until Wycliffe arrives and finds his investigation leading him up the Beales' garden path. *Wycliffe and the Four Jacks (1985) The reclusive writer David Cleeve has been receiving mysterious warnings in the form of a single playing card, the Jack of Diamonds. When the card arrives torn in half a murder is committed the same evening. Holidaying in the area, Wycliffe uncovers a tale of double murder, arson attacks and other crimes reverberating down the years. *Wycliffe and the Quiet Virgin (1986) With his wife away for Christmas, Wycliffe readily accepts an invitation to stay with a Penzance lawyer and his family in their remote country home; although when he arrives he finds the atmosphere less than welcoming, and the unease soon culminates in the disappearance of a young girl, whom he had seen playing the Virgin Mary in a recent nativity play. He soon discovers that the missing youth was unpopular in her local community, and even her parents seem indifferent about the whole affair. Nevertheless, the detective leads a mass search for her and is soon caught up in a major criminal investigation. *Wycliffe and the Winsor Blue (1987) *Wycliffe and the Tangled Web (1988) *Wycliffe and the Cycle of Death (1990) *Wycliffe and the Dead Flautist (1991) *Wycliffe and the Last Rites (1992) *Wycliffe and the Dunes Mystery (1993) *Wycliffe and the House of Fear (1995) *Wycliffe and the Redhead (1997) *Wycliffe and the Guild of Nine (2000) * Wycliffe and the Last Lap (2003) unfinished Henry Pym *A Taste of Power (1966) *Death in Willow Pattern (1969) Miscellaneous *The Schoolmaster (1977) *The Sixth Day (1978) *Charles and Elizabeth (1979) *The House of Care (1981) ReferencesExternal links * W.

At the center of a planet or star, gravitational compression produces heat by the Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz mechanism. This is the mechanism that explains how Jupiter continues to radiate heat produced by its gravitational compression. The most common reference to gravitational compression is stellar evolution. The Sun and other main-sequence stars are produced by the initial gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud. Assuming the mass of the material is large enough, gravitational compression reduces the size of the core, increasing its temperature until hydrogen fusion can begin. This hydrogen-to-helium fusion reaction releases energy that balances the inward gravitational pressure and the star becomes stable for millions of years. No further gravitational compression occurs until the hydrogen is nearly used up, reducing the thermal pressure of the fusion reaction. At the end of the Sun's life, gravitational compression will turn it into a white dwarf. At the other end of the scale are massive stars. These stars burn their fuel very quickly, ending their lives as supernovae, after which further gravitational compression will produce either a neutron star or a black hole from the remnants. For planets and moons, equilibrium is reached when the gravitational compression is balanced by a pressure gradient. This pressure gradient is in the opposite direction due to the strength of the material, at which point gravitational compression ceases.

The Schnellhardt compromise, proposed by Horst Schnellhardt, suggests that vodkas made from items other than cereals, potatoes and molasses should say \\"Vodka produced from...\\" on the label.

Arguments for restricted definition *Vodka must be clearly defined in the same way as has been done for other hard liquors, such as brandy or whiskey, in terms of raw ingredients and manufacturing process. *A restricted definition protects the quality and the originality of the product, in accord with the long- established traditions of its production, a brand protection similar to the \\"Protected designation of origin\\".

No other bowler has taken more than ten wickets in his only Test. * Among wicket-keepers, Indian player Rajindernath made four stumpings in his only Test, but was not called on to bat.Cricinfo - Players and Officials - Rajindernath * Ed Joyce played in Ireland's first Test match in May 2018, and announced his retirement from all cricket one week later. * Andy Lloyd scored 10 runs (not out) for England in his only test against the West Indies, in June 1984, before being struck on the head (helmeted), by a short-pitched delivery from Malcolm Marshall. Although subsequently recovering from the injury, he never played for his national team again. About one in eight Test cricketers are only picked once. Occasionally, one-Test wonders have been recalled to Test cricket after a gap of several years. One example was Ryan Sidebottom, who was recalled for his second Test in 2007 after his debut in 2001.Cricinfo - Glowing in the cold Coincidentally his father, Arnie Sidebottom, was a one-Test wonder.Cricinfo - Sidebottom ready for long-awaited second chance Darren Pattinson is an unusual one-Test wonder in that he played a single Test for England, while his brother James Pattinson had a more successful Test career with Australia.

The Navy designation was \\"Experimental 13-Shi Attack Bomber\\"; the Allied code name was \\"Liz\\". Design and development The Nakajima G5N Shinzan originated due to the Imperial Japanese Navy's interest in developing a long-range attack bomber capable of carrying heavy loads of bombs or torpedoes a minimum distance of . To meet this requirement, it became apparent a four-engine lay-out would be necessary. As Japanese aircraft manufacturers lacked experience in building such large complex aircraft, the Navy was forced to search for a suitable existing foreign-made model upon which to base the new design. It settled on the American Douglas DC-4E airliner. In 1939 the sole prototype of this airliner (previously rejected by American airline companies) was purchased by Nippon Koku K.K. (Japan Airlines Co) and clandestinely handed over to the Nakajima Aircraft Company for dismantling and inspection. The design that emerged from this study was for an all-metal mid- wing monoplane with fabric-covered control surfaces and powered by four 1,870 hp Nakajima NK7A Mamori 11 air-cooled radial engines driving four-bladed propellers. A long ventral bomb-bay, glazed nose and twin tailfins replacing the DC-4E's distinctive triple rudder were included. The DC-4E's retractable tricycle undercarriage was retained, as well as the original wing form and powerplant arrangement. Defensive armament comprised two 20mm Type 99 Model 1 cannon (one in a power-operated dorsal and one in a tail turret), plus single- mount hand-operated 7.7mm Type 92 machine guns in the nose, ventral and waist positions. The first prototype G5N1 made its maiden flight on 14:35 8 April 1941. Overall performance proved disappointingly poor however, due to a combination of excessive weight, the unreliability of the Mamori engines and the complexity of the design. Only three more prototypes were completed. In an attempt to salvage the project, two additional airframes were fitted with 1,530 hp Mitsubishi MK4B 12 \\"Kasei\\" engines and redesignated G5N2s. Although the Mitsubishi engines were more reliable than the original Mamori 11s, the aircraft was now even more hopelessly underpowered and further development of the type was halted. Operational history Of the six completed Shinzans, four were relegated for use as long-range Navy transports under the designation G5N2-L Shinzan-Kai Transport. The Allies allocated the code-name \\"Liz\\" to the aircraft, in the expectation it would be used as a bomber. Variants G8N1 Renzan (left).

The all-male membership brings together multi-instrumentalist musicians active across many other leading bands in the UK folk scene: Benji Kirkpatrick (Seth Lakeman Band, Bellowhead, Steeleye Span ), Saul Rose (Waterson‚ÄìCarthy, Whapweasel) and Paul Sartin (Bellowhead, Belshazzar's Feast). They have been described as ‚Äúbloke-folk‚Äù and aiming to ‚Äúrescue contemporary folk from the curse of feyness‚Äù (The Independent). In 2007 they received a 75th anniversary award from the English Folk Dance and Song Society, and they were nominated as best group at the 2009 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.  Origins (1998‚Äì2004)  Faustus evolved out of an earlier four-piece band, Dr Faustus, featuring Sartin and Kirkpatrick alongside melodeon player and singer Tim van Eyken and concertina player Robert Harbron. Sartin and Kirkpatrick had been playing together for a number of years, and were looking to expand their work with others to explore traditional English music. Sartin met van Eyken and Harbron while performing the Mick Ryan opera A Day's Work at Salisbury Playhouse. The band's name came from the traditional tune Dr Fauster‚Äôs Tumblers rather than the Christopher Marlowe play of the same name.Taplas 119, August/September 2003 The early years of the band were spent playing for the charities Superact and Live Music Now, putting live music into schools, prisons, hospitals and other venues. In 2002‚Äì03 the band recorded their first album The First Cut on Fellside recordings, and toured it through UK folk clubs and venues. They received a nomination for the Horizon Award (best new artist) at the 2004 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.  Wager and disbandment (2005)  The band also recorded their second album, Wager (2005) on Fellside. The album was toured, but afterwards rather than continue together the group disbanded to focus on other musical projects, including Bellowhead (of which Sartin and Kirkpatrick were founder members), Waterson‚ÄìCarthy, van Eyken's solo work, and Harbron's duo with Emma Reid.  Reformation (2006‚Äì09)  Sartin and Kirkpatrick decided to reform the band, with the addition of their friend melodeon player Saul Rose, in 2006. The resurrected band was renamed Faustus to reflect the slightly different line-up. The band were active on the UK folk music circuit, and received English Folk Dance and Song Society 75th anniversary awards in 2007, to commemorate their significant contributions to the development and continuity of traditional English folk music, song and dance. The band released the eponymous Faustus album in 2008 on Navigator Records., and were nominated for Best Group at the 2009 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. They lost out to Lau (band).  Hiatus (2010‚Äì11)  Kirkpatrick took on a prominent role in Seth Lakeman‚Äôs band during 2010, and the band briefly expanded to include Bellowhead drummer and percussionist Pete Flood and Australian singer/guitar/bouzouki player James Fagan, best known for his work with Nancy Kerr. The band appeared as a four-piece outfit, and occasionally a five-piece group when Kirkpatrick's touring commitments allowed.Taplas 158, February/March 2010 An official hiatus took place while Rose performed in the Royal National Theatre‚Äôs production of War Horse (play), a role previously undertaken by Tim van Eyken.  2011 to present  During 2011 Kirkpatrick stood back from his commitments to the Seth Lakeman Band, and the National Theatre replaced the War Horse cast, enabling Faustus to come together again. Their second album under the Faustus name, Broken Down Gentlemen, was released on Navigator Records in spring 2013. The band have undertaken twice-yearly tours, and performed at folk festivals all over the UK, Europe and New Zealand. During 2013 the band collaborated with dance group Morris Offspring to produce a work called The Furnace, which combined high energy morris dancing with Faustus's music. In 2016 Faustus became Artists in Residence at Halsway Manor, the National Centre for the Folk Arts, in Somerset. Their work at Halsway has seen them using the centre collections to explore developing arrangements of rare traditional folk music. A third Faustus album, Death and Other Animals, was released on the West Park Music label in Autumn 2016 The album was recorded at Halsway Manor, and features songs from the centre's extensive collection. This album was awarded the Preis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik for folk music in early 2017.

Dr. Plato Tracy Durham was the first Dean of the Candler School of Theology at Emory University, serving from 1914 to 1918. Background Plato Tracy Durham was the son of Captain Plato Durham of North Carolina and Nora Tracy Durham Dixon, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. James Wright Tracy. Dr. Durham was the stepson of a Methodist minister and the grandchild of a Methodist minister and was well trained in the workings of the church. Candler Dr. Durham was selected Dean of Candler in the summer of 1914, when Chancellor Warren A. Candler convinced Emory College to begin a school of theology subsequent the loss of Vanderbilt by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Candler School of Theology opened for classes on September 23, 1914. There were immediate criticisms of the school, chiefly that the faculty was too liberal.The Candler School of Theology: Sixty Years of Service, Boone M. Bowen, Emory University Press: Atlanta, Georgia, 1974. p. 15. During the Durham administration, the dean became an integral part of the administration of the University and in fact, Chancellor Candler considered Dean Durham his closest assistant, administering the University whenever Chancellor Candler's episcopal duties pulled him away from the campus.The Candler School of Theology: Sixty Years of Service, Boone M. Bowen, Emory University Press: Atlanta, Georgia, 1974. p. 21. In 1914, Candler was housed in Wesley Memorial church. When the Druid Hills campus was opened in the fall of 1916, Dean Durham oversaw the move into the new building. The chapel in the Theology building was named after Dean Durham and is currently the reading room in Pitts Library. Under Dean Durham's guidance, the theological pattern at the school conformed to the prevailing patterns at the time, with the focus of study being on Biblical studies.The Candler School of Theology: Sixty Years of Service, Boone M.

It is billed as the largest nightclub in the United States. While open throughout most of the year, the club has gained most of its fame and infamy during the weeks of spring break when thousands of college students converge on the club. History Built in 1984 as La Vela Beach Club and Concert Hall, the venue was designed by Walton Chancey and Timothy Packard Architects. It was originally owned by Alois Pfeffer and George Christo and after the initial season in the fall of 1984, Mr. Pfeffer became the sole owner in early 1985 and began the expansion that would eventually make LaVela Beach Club and Concert Hall, Club LaVela and the \\"World's Largest Nightclub\\". From the sinking of the original support pilings in the summer of 1984, LaVela (as it was first known) was constructed in 54 days culminating in a Grand Opening on Labor Day 1984, and an opening evening concert by John Prine. The building was Mr. Chancey's thesis from the School of Architecture at Auburn University. The original management team was headed by Willian Bass C.P.A., Gordon Hundley (deceased), Jimmy Christo Jr., and Clifford A. Becker. Alois Pfeffer himself an engineer, architect and international entrepreneur was instrumental in advising the recently graduated and certified architect team of Chancey & Packard. Originally set to cost $400,000 U.S., overtime exceeded that figure on the project alone. Alois Pfeffer continued to support the project through its infancy with money and expertise culminating in the grand opening. Original performing acts the first season included Ramsey Lewis, Gregg Allman, Robin Trower, Tom T. Hall, Pure Prairie League, Leon Redbone, The Outlaws and a host of others. The original venue was much smaller than it is presently, and in pre-reopening expansion, after a brief winter hiatus in November and December 1984, an outdoor band shell was added along with extended deck space and subsequently through the early years Mr. Pfeffer with the support of his wife and sons, oversaw the growth of the club. The club has added nine so- called \\"theme rooms\\", and additional dance floors, swimming pools, bars and more. With the addition of longtime resident DJ John Hulsey, as music director, several \\"Live Mix Shows\\" started in the late 80's and through 1999. From 1997 to 1999, World Championship Wrestling hosted an annual episode of WCW Monday Nitro at the venue in March (the event emanated from South Padre Island in Texas in 2000). The purpose of each of the annual \\"Spring Break-Out\\" episodes was to gain favor with adolescent and young adult viewers who were not familiar with Nitro. The nearby Boardwalk Beach Resort was the site for the final episode of Nitro on March 26, 2001. The club today Club La Vela's main stage and pool deck area at night Currently, Club La Vela's capacity stands at 6,000 patrons, and the club has evolved into a major entertainment complex. Different dance rooms cater to fans of house music, trance, rock and hip hop; one room also features foam blowers. During summer and spring break, the club also features \\"The Darkroom\\", a venue for patrons under 18 years old, and the club periodically hosts \\"Teenbashes\\", on Sundays in which the club is open only to teens and there is no alcohol service. Because of its popularity during spring break, Club La Vela has been the focus of numerous media reports and events. MTV has made the club its home during numerous spring breaks over the past decade. The club is known for its bikini and wet T-shirt contests for women and \\"hard body\\" contests for men. Club La Vela has also been featured by E! and is the home party spot to the \\"Girls Next Door\\" and the Playboy Crew, and its original show Wild On.... Other cable and broadcast channels featuring Club La Vela include ESPN, TNT, Travel Channel, MSNBC, French channel Canal Plus and Germany's RTL II and Pro7. Dozens of retail brands have sponsored various events at the club. On January 6, 2014, Pfeffer expanded into broadcasting by taking over the operations of WPCF, an AM radio station in Panama City that also simulcasts on a FM Translator. The station plays a Dance format billed as \\"93.1 Play FM\\" and will serve as a tie-in to the club's events and activities.Dance Plays In Panama City from Radio Insight (January 6, 2014) The club has been the subject of numerous reports that it has been sold and is closing to make way for high- rise condominiums. The most recent reports had the club closing after the 2005 spring break rush, but the club remained. In 2018, hurricane Michael caused the club not to reopen. As of 2020, it remains closed with no announced re- open date. Legal issues Largely because of its size, popularity, party atmosphere and frequent media coverage, Club La Vela has been subject of several run-ins with the authorities. Occasional troubles with the Bay County sheriff have occurred over the years, with little or no legal action resulting against the club itself or its owners. However, that changed in June 2001, when the owners and the club's corporate parent Sea Watch of Panama City Beach, Inc. were indicted by a federal grand jury for violating a federal statute which makes venue owners liable for the drug use of their patrons. The charges were the end result of a five-year investigation of Club La Vela. At the October 2001 trial, prosecutors showed the jury BlowPops, chewing gum and glow sticks that were seized in the raid. The items were presented as evidence of drug use, despite no evidence of actual drugs. After just more than an hour of deliberation, the jury found the defendants not guilty on all counts. A federal grand jury which heard all the evidence cleared the club and its owners of all charges. The club has since hired former law enforcement veterans to generally run their security.

Lehninger principles of biochemistry. 6th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman; 2013 p. 1124-1126. The enzyme monomethylamine methyltransferase catalyzes the reaction of monomethylamine to methane. This enzyme includes pyrrolysine. The unusual amino acid is inserted using a unique tRNA, the anticodon of which is UAG. In most organisms, and in most Methanosarcinaceae proteins, UAG is a stop codon. However in this enzyme, and anywhere else pyrrolysine is incorporated, likely through contextual markers on the mRNA, the pyrrolysine-loaded tRNA is inserted instead of the release factor. They also have a unique aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to specifically load this tRNA with pyrrolysine. This unique adaptation is still the subject of significant study.

The purpose of a person-fit analysis is to detect item- score vectors that are unlikely given a hypothesized test theory model such as item response theory, or unlikely compared with the majority of item-score vectors in the sample. An item-score vector is a list of \\"scores\\" that a person gets on the items of a test, where \\"1\\" is correct and \\"0\\" is incorrect. For example, if a person took a ten-item quiz and answered only the first five questions correctly, the vector would be {1111100000}. In individual decision- making in education, psychology, and personnel selection, it is critically important that test users can have confidence in the test scores used. The validity of individual test scores may be threatened when the examinee's answers are governed by factors other than the psychological trait of interest - factors that can range from something as benign as the examinee dozing off to concerted fraud efforts. Person-fit methods are used to detect item-score vectors where such external factors may be relevant, and as a result, indicate invalid measurement. Unfortunately, person-fit statistics only tell if the set of responses is likely or unlikely, and cannot prove anything. The results of the analysis might look like an examinee cheated, but the ability to prove it by returning to when the test was administered is not possible. This limits its practical applicability on an individual scale. However, it might be useful on a larger scale; if most examinees at a certain test site or with a certain proctor have unlikely responses, an investigation might be warranted.

() The updated paperback edition (2011, Picador) is retitled The Old, Weird America, a term coined by Marcus to describe the often eerie country, blues, and folk music featured on the Anthology of American Folk Music (1927-1932; released 1952). In his opinion, the sensibility of Anthology is reflected by the Basement Tapes recordings. The term has been revived via the musical genre called New Weird America. Content Marcus quotes Robbie Robertson‚Äôs memories of recording the Basement Tapes: \\"[Dylan] would pull these songs out of nowhere. We didn't know if he wrote them or if he remembered them. When he sang them, you couldn't tell.\\"Marcus, p. xvi Marcus called these songs \\"palavers with a community of ghosts.\\"Marcus, p. 86 He suggests that \\"these ghosts were not abstractions. As native sons and daughters they were a community. And they were once gathered in a single place: on the Anthology of American Folk Music, a work produced by a 29-year-old of no fixed address named Harry Smith.\\"Marcus, p. 87 Marcus argues Dylan's basement songs were a resurrection of the spirit of Anthology, originally published by Folkways Records in 1952, a collection of blues and country songs recorded in the 1920s and 1930s, which proved very influential in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s. Anthology, initially titled American Folk Music, was reissued by Smithsonian Folkways as a box set of compact disc in the same year as the book's publication, with portions of the book excerpted as liner notes. Marcus links the First Great Awakening, the folk music revival of the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement and the Battle of Matewan in West Virginia with Bob Dylan's 1966 tour with the Hawks.

Inisa had been from time immemorial, a warrior community. She was deeply involved in the struggle for the survival of Yoruba race during the period of internecine wars and particularly, during the onslaught and incursions of the Fulani into Yorubaland in the 19th Century. Inisa people participated actively in the series of the wars. They fought in the Osogbo war of 1840, the Jalumi War of 1878, the Ofa war (1886-1890) and the Daparu war. The Ofa war resulted from the desire of Ilorin-fulani to avenge their defeat at the Jalumi on Ofa and the neighboring towns(The war was fought during the reign king of Oba Oloyede Ojo, Otepola 1. They laid siege on Ofa for several years before Ofa was eventually sacked around 1890. The Daparu war resulted from the sack and fall of Ofa. The Fulani now desired to sack all the towns and villages between Ofa and Osogbo and bring them under the rule of the Fulani of Ilorin. They continued to attacks, raid and wage wars on the people. Only Inisa was brave and courageous enough to face the Fulani forces, as the other towns and villages were deserted, seeking refuge at Ibadan war camp in Ikirun.

Biography Foster Cunliffe inherited the baronetcy from his father, Sir Robert Cunliffe, 2nd Baronet on his death in 1778. He married Harriet, the daughter of Sir David Kinloch, 5th Baronet.Complete Baronetage Sir Foster Cunliffe was uneasy about this because he seems to have concealed the origin of the fortune, omitting the word 'slavery' in a detailed history of his family's genealogy. His grandfather, Foster Cunliffe (1682‚Äì1758), made the money by becoming the main slave trader in Liverpool and mayor on three occasions. His son was MP for Liverpool in 1755-67. Sir Foster Cunliffe moved from Saighton, near Chester, to the Acton Park estate near Wrexham, Denbighshire, adding to the existing house, including adding the lavish Four Dogs gateway into the estate - all that remains of the original buildings to this day. He served as High Sheriff of Denbighshire for 1787.Complete Baronetage He also enlarged and improved Pant- yr-ochain , once the main house in Gresford, now a well known gastro pub. The father of 11 bought the building as a home for two of his unmarried daughters, Charlotte & Emma, to take up residence. The sisters were known to hold great parties and to entertain the local gentry. These included Charles Williams- Wynn, their brother-in-law, and the Glynne family of Hawarden. Catherine Glynne married William Ewart Gladstone, who was Prime Minister no less than four times, and who was known to have ridden to the sisters' home in Gresford. In addition to his archery, Sir Foster Cunliffe, 3rd Baronet of Acton Park, was also an active member of the Wrexham Yeomanry Cavalry during the Napoleonic Wars. Archery One popular pursuit among the gentry was archery. In fact, Sir Foster Cunliffe and the Williams-Wynns were founders of the Society of British Bowmen, later the Royal Society of British Bowmen, which was formed at Acton Hall in 1787. A painting of Sir Foster Cunliffe by John Hoppner shows him standing full length in a wooded landscape, wearing an archer's uniform, with green coat, buff yellow breeches and hessian boots. His archer's plumed black hat rests at his feet. A campaign is underway in Wrexham to raise money to buy the painting which was displayed at the Wrexham Art Treasures and Industrial Exhibition of 1876. Apparently, the exhibition was the cultural highpoint of 19th century Wrexham, with paintings by Reynolds, Gainsborough and Lawrence. Legacy Before his death, Acton Park was the chief house of Wrexham. The house was rebuilt between 1687‚Äì95 and enlarged in 1786-7 when the Foster Cunliffes moved in. The park was created in the 1790s. His son, Sir Robert inherited the house and it was given to his grandson, also Sir Robert. An MP for Flint and then Denbigh, he died in 1905 and was the last of the family to own Acton Hall, which became known locally as Acton Park. By the 1920s descendants had sold the land piecemeal and the hall was demolished in 1954.

At the time of the Swedish 1994 referendum on membership in the European Union, Esch clashed with the Moderate Party as he campaigned on the \\"no\\" side. When he subsequently formed a list of EU critics that ran in the 1995 European Parliament election in Sweden, he was expelled from the party. This list was unsuccessful in the election, and von der Esch returned to parliamentary politics in 1998 as a Christian Democrat. In the 2003 referendum on joining the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro, he again campaigned on the \\"no\\" side. He later joined the June List, became its vice chairman in 2008, and was on second place on the June List ballot in the 2009 European Parliament election in which the party lost its representation in the European Parliament.

General Biography Franklin Nutting Parker was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on May 20, 1867. He was the son of Bishop Linus Parker and Ellen Katherine Burruss Parker. He attended Centenary College of Louisiana and then Tulane University. Parker served in churches throughout Louisiana until 1911 when he left to become the Professor of Biblical Literature at Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina (now known as Duke University). He taught there for three years until he was sought by Bishop Warren A. Candler to come to the newly founded Candler School of Theology at Emory University, where Parker would spend the rest of his life. He occupied the chair of Systematic Theology from 1915‚Äì1918, and then became Dean of the School in 1919. Parker served as Dean until 1938 when he became Dean Emeritus. He continued teaching, however, until 1942. Parker was married to Minnie Greeves Jones, and they had two daughters. Franklin N. Parker died on March 1, 1954 in Atlanta, Georgia. Emory University Candler School of Theology When Dean Durham resigned in November 1918, the chair was held for a month by Dean Howard. Dr. Parker became Dean on January 1, 1919, and served in that position until June 1937 (he was 71 years old). Like Dean Durham before him, he remained an active member of the faculty until his retirement in 1942 at 81 years of age. In 1918, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South elected Dr. Parker a bishop. He declined. In 1922 he would not allow his name to be put into nomination for bishop, as he preferred to remain working as Dean. In 1920, Dr. Parker served as Acting Chancellor after Warren A. Candler asked to resign and then as Acting President when Bishop Candler reluctantly resumed the chancellorship for a period of time. In the fall of 1920, Dr. Harvey Warner Cox assumed the office of president for the University. Controversies Tensions had existed in the Durham administration of Candler School of Theology, but they became a crucial problem for Dean Parker. The liberal leanings of the school and faculty were well known in the institutional church. The church's suspicions of Candler were based primarily on the theological liberalism of Professors Sledd, Smart and Shelton. These professors were committed to a historical critical approach to the bible (commonly known as higher criticism).Boone M. Bowen, The Candler School of Theology: Sixty Years of Service, Emory University Press: Atlanta, GA, 1974. p. 35. Franklin N.

Roger Carcassonne-Leduc (12 January 1911 in Marnia - 10 December 1991 in Paris, France), was a member of the French Resistance. A French industrialist in Oran, he served as a second lieutenant with the 8th Regiment. Sent to Tunisia, at the time of the armistice he appeared in front of the military justice for having posted and distributed the texts of the call of June 18 from General Charles de Gaulle.  Foundation of Oran Resistance  Transferred with his unit to Oran, Carcassonne was demobilized on 28 August 1940 and sought immediately, with his brother Pierre Carcassonne, to go to England via Gibraltar. But this was in vain, because the Vichy police and naval services guarded well and, the denouncement helping, more severe judgments rained down on those who were captured. He then organized, with the help of his brother Pierre and some friends, including Captain Louis Jobelot, a group which was devoted to producing discrete propaganda and tried to gather everyone possible. In March 1941, in Oran, Captain Jobelot introduced Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie to him, an officer at the Second Bureau of the Armistice Army, with whom he immediately sympathized. After some interviews, the two men decided to create a movement, and intended to gather all those who wanted to fight against the Germans.  Co-operation with the Algiers resistance  Roger and Pierre Carcassonne continued to develop the recruitment and the coordination of the forces and intelligence agents. In August 1941, in Algiers, Carcassonne met his cousin Jos√© Aboulker, a medical student, who had also begun resistance in September 1940. The two men decided to keep up to date with their activities, however without combining their respective organizations. Carcassonne in Oran, under the pseudonym of Leduc, and Aboulker in Algiers, continued their activities which were centred on the construction of armed groups and military and civilian information centres. They did not engage propaganda, considering it to have little effect but likely to draw attention of their opponents. In 1942, Carcassonne sent his brother in Algiers to introduce Jose Aboulker to Henri d'Astier of Vigerie. He also dealt with the expenses of the Oran group and financed the organization of the resistance for all North Africa.

He spent his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he became a popular player, scoring around 101 goals in all competitions.

However, the main sport in the family quickly changed to football as he and his brother, Cyril Knowles, proved to have significant football talent. Peter's talent was spotted by Wath Wanderers, a feeder team which trained youth players primarily for Wolverhampton Wanderers. In 1961, aged 16, Knowles spent a year with the youth outfit, playing under supervision from Wath's coach, Mark Crook. Knowles quickly caught the attention of Wolves, who in 1962 signed the 17-year-old on a six-year contract. Wolverhampton Wanderers The Wolves side he joined was just starting to slip from their position towards the top of English football. Therefore, manager Stan Cullis gave him his debut early in the 1963‚Äì64 season, in a victory over Leicester City. He scored his first goal a game later, against Bolton Wanderers in a 2‚Äì2 draw. In the 1964‚Äì65 season, Wolves were relegated in last-but-one place. However, it was that season which saw Knowles emerge as a top class footballer. The teenager played with an arrogant swagger, finishing the season with six goals and setting up many others. Despite his good form for Wolves, he was disappointed at the relegation and asked for a transfer. This request was rejected, allowing Knowles to build upon his success at Wolves. The departure of Stan Cullis, the man who originally gave Knowles his chance, was a factor in his request to leave Molineux. Ronnie Allen took over the job from Cullis. In the 1965‚Äì66 season, it quickly became apparent that Knowles was a notch above just about everyone else playing in the Second Division. Among a handful of goals, he scored two hat-tricks early on in the season against Carlisle United and Derby County, making him the top scorer for the club by some way. His good form was interrupted however, as he endured the first big injury of his career. Despite missing a number of games, he managed to finish the season with 19 goals. Frustratingly for Knowles, Wolves did not manage to gain promotion that season, condemning him to another season of Second Division football. He remained at Molineux, and in the 1966‚Äì67 season Wolves finished runners-up in the Second Division and achieved promotion to the First Division. On his return to the First Division, he suffered from injury problems once again, only managing 21 appearances and eight goals. Later on in that season however, Knowles was compensated with a call up to the Under-23 England team. In a move by FIFA to raise awareness of \\"soccer\\" in the United States, a mini-league was held in which various teams from Britain went to America to represent different states. Wolves represented Los Angeles, and Knowles featured in the side as they went on to win their league. The 21-year- old Knowles scored several goals in the tournament. The 1967‚Äì68 season brought about a new strike partner for Knowles, in the form of Derek \\"The Doog\\" Dougan. Knowles, now an established performer, performed well in the top flight with Dougan, managing to narrowly avoid relegation. Knowles, amongst the Wolves' scorers behind Dougan with 17 and ahead of Frank Wignall who was hired from Nottingham with nine goals, managed 12 goals during the season, which led to the 22-year-old receiving three more Under-23 international caps. With the 1970 World Cup in Mexico quickly approaching, Knowles sought a move away from Wolves. His request was once again rejected by manager Allen. In the 1968‚Äì69 season, Wolves finished 16th in the table, Knowles being second best scorer of the club behind Dougan with 11 goals. In the summer which followed, Knowles once again travelled to the United States to play in a promotional league. This time, Wolves represented Kansas City. Knowles scored five in the tournament, helping Wolves to its second state-side victory. Retirement Upon his return to Britain, Knowles made an announcement which saw his career take a dramatic and unexpected turn. While in Kansas he became a Jehovah's Witness, and in his own words, \\"I shall continue playing football for the time being but I have lost my ambition. Though I still do my best on the field I need more time to learn about the Bible and may give up football.\\" Despite this, Wolves got the 1969‚Äì70 season off to a great start, winning the first four matches, Knowles scoring in the first three of them. Two home draws and an away defeat in Coventry followed. The eighth game of the season, a 3‚Äì3 draw at home against Nottingham Forest, was the last game that Knowles ever played.Munro, Frank; \\"God's footballer plays his final game\\" Guardian.co.uk, 6 September 2008 (Retrieved: 16 September 2009) Knowles was now retired from football, and the dream of winning a full England cap would never be fulfilled. But a succession of Wolves managers held out the hope that Knowles might one day return to the game, and he remained on contract at the club for the next 12 years. In 1982, however, new manager Graham Hawkins conceded that Knowles would never return, and promptly terminated the 36-year-old's contract. 1991 saw folk musician Billy Bragg release a song which many saw as a direct reference to Knowles. The song was called \\"God's Footballer\\", from Bragg's album Don't Try This at Home. Knowles later worked as a milkman, a window cleaner and in the warehouse of Marks & Spencer. Knowles has consistently stated that he never regretted giving up football.https://footballpink.net/2017/12/05/sibling-rivalry-part-5-the- knowles-brothers-gods-footballers/ ReferencesExternal links * Old Gold: Peter Knowles TheWolvesSite.co.uk Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:People from Fitzwilliam, West Yorkshire Category:English footballers Category:England under-23 international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:United Soccer Association players Category:Los Angeles Wolves players Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players Category:Kansas City Spurs players Category:Converts to Jehovah's Witnesses Category:English Jehovah's Witnesses Category:Sportspeople from Yorkshire Category:English Football League players Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:English expatriate footballers ","title":"Peter Knowles"},{"id":"10055876","text":"Kenneth Lantz (born 1949) is a Swedish Christian democratic politician, member of the Riksdag 1991-1994 and again 1998-2006.

It is in the Frick Collection in New York City, displayed prominently in what was the living room of Henry Clay Frick, an American industrialist, financier, and art patron. The painting is oil on panel and shows the influence of Andrea Mantegna, who was the painter's brother-in-law. It is signed IOANNES BELLINVS on a small, creased tag visible in the lower left corner. The painting is now in the Frick Collection and it is considered to be one of its finest assets. Painting The painting portrays the Italian 12th-century saint Francis of Assisi in an Italian landscape, stepping out in the sun from his cave. Francis lived under poor conditions in the beginning of his sainthood and used to participate in isolated spiritual retreats at monasteries but this painting is most probably a symbolic representation of the saint. The animals in the picture may represent the saint's love for nature and animals. The Ecstasy of St. Francis is depicting Francis in a religious ecstasy, perhaps receiving the stigmata, as Millard Meiss suggested though, when Francis is receiving the sigmata, usually an angel, a seraph or a crucifix emitting rays is depicted as well. Alternatively, he may be praying or perhaps singing his Canticle of the Sun, as Richard Turner has argued.A similar suggestion is made by Anthony F. Janson, \\"The meaning of the landscape in Bellini's St. Francis in Ecstasy\\", Artibus et Historiae (1994:40ff); he suggests that the landscape is redolent of the Heavenly Jerusalem. Whatever the specific moment portrayed may be, the representation is a fresh one and does not follow any of the established iconographic motifs. In the left middle-ground is a donkey which can be interpreted as a symbol of humility and patience. In the lower right corner, on a rustic reading table, is a skull, representing mortality, welcomed in the last stanza of the saint's Canticle. The cave may relate Francis to Saint Jerome, who also lived in a cave or cell. The stream in the left middle-ground symbolizes Moses and the great spring, while the barren tree in the centre of the painting represents the Burning Bush. The saint has left his wooden pattens behind and stands barefoot like Moses.Horst Woldemar Janson, Anthony F. Janson, History of art: the Western tradition \\"Giovanni Bellini\\". In the distance rises the still-empty Heavenly Jerusalem. The overall composition is thought to be a meditation of St. Francis on the creation of the world as related in the Book of Genesis. Though it has been cut down, it has otherwise been well-cared for since its creation.

The area he governed included the oil fields of northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York. The knowledge of the oil seepages there was well known among the Indians, and it was declared neutral ground so all Indians could obtain oil for medicinal and domestic purposes without danger or interference. In 1627, Joseph de La Roche Daillon heard of the oil springs and made an expedition to visit them. He was kindly received by Chief Soubarissen, shown the oil seepages, and duly reported his observations to his superiors. These observations contributed largely to the interest in the petroleum resources of the Pennsylvania region. Soubarissen, was laid down as SS Mission Santa Ana on 19 June 1944 by Marinship Corporation of Sausalito, California as a Maritime Commission type T2-SE-A2 tanker hull with a cargo capacity of , under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1828); launched on 12 August 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Andrew F. Carter; acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 5 January 1945 with Commander William H. Fogarty, USNR, in command. Service history=World War II, 1945‚Äì1946 Soubarissen was then converted from a fleet oiler to a water supply ship. On 23 January, she moved to San Pedro, California to begin her shakedown cruise. Upon completion of shakedown and yard availability at San Diego she returned to San Pedro to top off fresh water and cargo. She sailed for Hawaii on 1 March and reported at Pearl Harbor on 7 March for duty with the Service Force, Pacific Fleet. She was routed onward to Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands, where, by the 30th, she had discharged over of water to Navy ships. She then proceeded to Guam in the Mariana Islands to refill her tanks. Soubarissen sailed for Ulithi, Caroline Islands on 6 April where she was assigned to a task unit that was proceeding to Kerama Retto, Nansei Shoto, arriving on 26 April. She remained there discharging fresh water and fog oil until 17 May when she joined a convoy back to Ulithi. From there she was routed to Manus in the Admiralty Islands. From 24 May to 1 June, she loaded cargo; returned to Ulithi on the 2nd; sailed the next day with a convoy; and was back at Kerama Retto from 7 to 15 June. From that day and through 24 December, she made eight more voyages transporting fresh water between Kerama Retto and Lauaan Bay, Samar in the Philippines. On 25 December 1945 Soubarissen moved to Hong Kong, and operated there until 30 March 1946 when she sailed for Mobile, Alabama via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal Zone. Soubarissen received one battle star for World War II service. In service, 1946‚Äì1961 Soubarissen arrived at Mobile on 17 April and was decommissioned and returned to the War Shipping Administration in May 1946. She was reacquired by the Navy on 19 February 1948, delivered to Marine Transport Lines, Inc. to be operated, under contract, for the Navy Transportation Service (MTS) as Soubarissen (AO-93). Control was transferred to the Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS) 1 October 1949 when she was redesignated USNS Soubarissen (T-AO-93). Until 1955 she operated in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, calling at ports from Hamburg, Germany to Saudi Arabia and Pusan, Korea. On 20 April 1955 she was returned to the Maritime Administration and berthed at Beaumont, Texas with the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Soubarissen was returned to the Navy on 6 July 1956 and operated in the Atlantic by MSTS until 30 December 1958 when she was again placed in the Beaumont Reserve Fleet of the Maritime Administration. Her title was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 1 April 1961 and she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1961. Disposal, 1982 Soubarissen remained in the Beaumont Reserve Fleet until she was disposed of by a MARAD vessel exchange on 19 March 1982. She was traded to the Farrell Lines along with three other vessels in exchange for the . Farrell Lines immediately resold Soubarissen to Echhardt & Co. Marine, who then in turn sold the tanker to Iterresources Inc. for further resale to Brownsville Steel & Salvage, Brownsville, Texas. Soubarissen was delivered to the scrapyard on 5 April 1982 and she was scrapped by 30 July 1982.

Distribution and habitat Breeding distribution of Otus brucei The pallid scops owl ranges from the Middle East to West and Central Asia, with some populations moving as far as the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, and Pakistan in the winter. It inhabits semi-open country with trees and bushes and has an estimated range of one to ten million kilometers.Birdlife International - Species Factsheet: Otus brucei in 2015, a new population of over 400 pairs was found in the Rift Valley, Israel and in 2016 more pairs and nests were found in Jorden (east to the Jorden River), all nesting in palms plantations (Ben Dov A., Kiat Y. 2015) There have been many records from the state of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in India, and a single record of this species from paddyfields in the southern state of Kerala. Behavior=Diet Primarily an insectivore, the pallid scops owl's diet includes insects, lizards, spiders, and small mammals. It occasionally hunts during the day, and has been known to take bats and insects on the wing.Striated Scops Owl Nesting Breeding takes place any time between April and June, where 4 to 6 eggs are laid in a tree cavity, such as a woodpecker hole.

History  The railway was authorised on 11 August 1879, it started from a new junction, Dunmore Junction, on the South Alloa branch of the Scottish Central Section of the Caledonian Railway located approximately north of Alloa Junction. It was long, with a swing bridge over River Forth, and terminated at a piece of vacant ground in the town of Alloa, on the west side of the private road leading from Craigward Place to Bass Crest Brewery, about 230 metres short of the final point of termination. From the beginning the CR supported the railway financially, they entered into agreements for the maintenance, management and working of the railway, and had those arrangements approved by Parliament. In 1884 the CR absorbed the Alloa Railway before the line had been completed. The Act authorising the absorption of the Alloa Railway also provided for an extension of one furlong one chain and eleven yards (231 metres) from the planned terminus in Alloa so that the line now terminated on the western side of Glasshouse Loan.  Alloa Swing Bridge  The major civil engineering construction on the line was the Alloa Swing Bridge, this was a railway swing bridge across the River Forth. The structure was in use until 1968 and was demolished in 1971.  NBR connecting line  The connecting line between Alloa West junction and Longcarse junction (called the Alloa Junction Loop on OS maps) belonged to the North British Railway (NBR) and as such it was authorised by a different parliamentary Act, this Act was also used to confirm the reciprocal running powers agreement between the CR and the NBR. The NBR gave the CR access to its station in Alloa via the Alloa Junction Loop and the section of the line from there to Alloa station, they also agreed to contribute towards the doubling of the rest of the line, in exchange the CR gave the NBR access to the Alloa Railway and its former Scottish Central Line as far as the junction with the NBR at Greenhill.  Alloa stations  To accommodate the CR at its station the NBR firstly opened a new goods station on 21 September 1885 to the east of Glasshouse Loan on the Harbour branch in order to create some space at the passenger station, it also undertook some alterations to the station itself prior to a major rebuilding scheduled for the following few years. The CR opened its own goods station on the site mentioned above, on the western side of Glasshouse Loan, directly opposite the NBR one. The CR set up its own passenger booking office at Alloa station, in what had formerly been the parcel office.  Openings  The Caledonian line and the North British connecting line both opened on 1 October 1885, there were no stations opened on the line at this time. The Edinburgh Evening News reported the first train: > To-day the new Alloa Railway and Bridge were opened for traffic by the > Caledonian and North British Railway Companies. The first train which left > Alloa N.B. station for the new bridge line was a Caledonian one, consisting > of three new carriages having all the latest improvements and fitted with > gas tanks, so that the gas light will be supplied in place of the old oil > lamps. A large number of people witnessed the departure of the train, which > had about a dozen passengers, most of whom intended going to Larbert > junction and return with the following train.Mr Gillespie, Perth, the > district superintendent accompanied the train. The N.B. Company have running > powers over this new line which considerably shortens the distance to > Glasgow, the time occupied in the run between Alloa and Glasgow being now > one hour. station opened to the south of the swing bridge in 1890.  Operations  The NBR made full use of the running powers, which gave it a viable route from Perth to Glasgow avoiding the Caledonian, except where it had running powers (between Perth and Hilton Junction and over the Alloa bridge section). Express passenger and goods services were brought over the line. Use of the route by NBR goods trains was especially heavy between the opening of the (Second) Tay Bridge and the opening of the Forth Bridge, for services from Dundee southwards. During the First World war Bandeath Munitions Depot was established on the peninsula to the west of the swing bridge, it had rail access from a junction to the south of the bridge, between it and station. British Railways added a second connection from Longcarse Junction to Alloa Marshalling Yard (parallel with the S&D; line) in 1957. This made the turntable at Alloa passenger station redundant.  Closure  The line closed in stages, firstly the passenger service was withdrawn on 29 January 1968. The section from Longcarse Junction to the junction for the RNAD at Throsk, including the swing bridge, closed completely on 6 May 1968. The line may have been closed to all traffic but it was retained until the bridge was fixed in the open position on 18 May 1970, at this time it finally closed together with the section between Longcarse Junction and Alloa West Junction. The Alloa Swing Bridge was mostly demolished on 8 February 1971, the piers remain as wildlife havens sheltering cormorants. Then on 1 April 1978 the remaining southerly section from Throsk to Alloa Junction closed.

Background Harper was born in Belfast and graduated in Modern History 1989 from Queen's University, Belfast, later acquiring a postgraduate diploma in Information Management from Queen's University (1997) and a PhD in Cultural Studies from the University of Sunderland (2014). Between 1994 and 2001 he was a professional freelance journalist. For Belfast newspaper Irish News he wrote features on unsigned local bands and famous bands on tour. In the same period he wrote features and reviewed regularly for popular music magazines such as Q and Mojo. He also contributed both theatre and music reviews to The Irish Times. Harper became a regular writer of liner notes for compilations of folk, acoustic and prog-rock artists appearing on record labels including Windsong, Demon, Castle, Hux and Snapper. His long-time admiration of Bert Jansch led to his biography of Jansch, Dazzling Stranger (its title taken from a song by Alan Tunbridge). This was launched at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. He followed up the book release by being the driving force behind the tribute album People on the Highway: A Bert Jansch Encomium (Market Square, 2000). He also contributed to the Jansch documentary Dreamweaver on Channel 4 in 2000. An updated edition of Dazzling Stranger was released in 2006 including a foreword by The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. It was further updated in 2011, with a new Afterword by Pete Paphides. Harper had a sabbatical in the public sector between 2001 and 2011. He continued to contribute to magazines, mainly for Mojo and Record Collector, until 2007. During this time he published one more book, Seaside Rock (2003), a small monograph on pop music in North Down in the 60s, and co-wrote Irish Folk, Trad and Blues: A Secret History (with Trevor Hodgett, 2004 and 2005 ). In support of the charity World Wide Fund for Nature Harper organised two benefit compilation albums: The Wildlife Album (2004) and Live In Hope: The Wildlife Album 2 (2005). His other annotated CD compilations include the collected works of Atomic Rooster and Andy Roberts. Freedom & The Dream Penguin, a collection of his songs ‚Äì fronted by guest vocalists including Judy Dyble, Alison O'Donnell, Janet Holmes, Paul Casey and Brian Houston ‚Äì was released in 2008, credited to The Field Mouse Conspiracy. An album of original instrumental compositions, Titanium Flag, was self-released in 2010. Escaping from the public sector in December 2011, Harper threw himself back into creative mode, beginning work on Bathed in Lightning: John McLaughlin, the 60s and the Emerald Beyond, his biography of guitarist John McLaughlin (up to 1975) in the context of London's musical scenes (jazz, R&B;, free improvisation, pop session work) in the 1960s. The book was published by Jawbone Press in 2015, pre-launched with a music and speech podcast event with a live audience at Belfast's RedBox Studios, involving Irish jazz personality/BBC NI broadcaster Linley Hamilton, Horslips member/RTE broadcaster Jim Lockhart and various local jazz, blues, bluegrass and pop musicians. Unusually, the ebook edition added nearly 100,000 words of extra content to the 215,000-word print edition, with the ebook content also published as a stand-alone ebook for a nominal price at Harper's behest. Two further books followed, written simultaneously, in 2015. The Wheels of The World: 300 Years of Irish Uilleann Pipers (Jawbone Press, 2015) is a 250,000-word history of the Irish pipes told through detailed chapters on some of its greatest player, going back to the early 1700s. It was written in collaboration with international recording artist/piper John McSherry. The book was promoted with articles in fRoots and the Irish Times, and by a number of live events at festivals, concerts and bookshops in Ireland in mid to late 2015, and radio sessions on BBC NI and RTE including an edition of Arena helmed by Jim Lockhart. Eyes Wide Open: True Tales of a Wishbone Ash Warrior (Jawbone Press, 2015) was published with a month of the piping book in October 2015, written by guitarist/vocalist Andy Powell in close collaboration with Harper. It was launched with an onstage Q&A; at Wishbone Ash's annual AshCon event in Chesterfield in November 2015. Other creative activity in the 2012‚Äì15 period included extensive booklets for the RPM record label's celebrations of the work of 1960s‚Äì70s British folk and jazz producer Peter Eden: The Eve Folk Recordings (RPM, 2014) 2-CD set and Turtle Records: Pioneering British Jazz 1970‚Äì71 (RPM, 2015), a 3-CD box set with 17,000 word perfect-bound booklet, including interviews with Eden and many of his artists ‚Äì Howard Riley, Barry Guy, Mike Cooper, Mike Gibbs, Norma Winstone, John Taylor and others. Harper was also involved in the reissue, including booklet essay, of another 1970 Peter Eden production, guitarist Chris Spedding's Songs Without Words (Hux, 2015), and also annotated a 4CD Wishbone Ash box Road Works (Talking Elephant, 2016) in this period. In March 2016 Harper's mostly instrumental album Sunset Cavaliers, widely reviewed in Brirtish music journals (Mojo, Uncut, Prog, R2, Choice, Record Collector), was released by Market Square Records. A homage to the musical soundworlds and time period Harper chronicles most often in his writing, the album featured guest appearances from many of his recent and past collaborators ‚Äì John McSherry (uilleann pipes), Chris Spedding, Andy Powell, Bert Jansch (guitars), Linley Hamilton (flugelhorn), and Duffy Power (harmonica/vocal) among others. Harper had been asked to write three obituaries on Power ‚Äì whom he regards as one of the unsung greats of the 1960s ‚Äì in February 2014, for The Guardian, Mojo and Record Collector. During the first quarter of 2016, Harper focused on curating for Hux Records, as the label's 150th release, Spirits From Another Time: 1969-71 a 2-CD set of unreleased studio material by multicultural British rock band Quintessence. Material was licensed from Universal, digitised at Abbey Road Studios, and mixed and mastered by Cormac O'Kane with Harper at RedBox Studios, Belfast. Original members Phil 'Shiva' Jones and Dave 'Maha Dev' Codling contributed new parts to three tracks at studios in Leeds, UK and Woodstock, USA, and the set includes an 11,000 word essay. The album is the sixth Quintessence project Harper has worked on with Hux, other releases including Cosmic Energy: Live At St Pancras 1970 (2009), Infinite Love: Live at Queen Elizabeth Hall 1971 (2009) and Rebirth: Live At Glastonbury 2010 (2011). From August 2015, Harper has primarily been working as an academic proofreader. He continues to be involved in musical projects of his own, occasional journalism, and occasional reissue projects with labels such as Hux and RPM and the vinyl specialist label Earth Recordings. Examples of his journalism can be found at subscription website Rock's Backpages.

The treaty was ratified on 25 March 1939. The Iberian Pact marked the beginning of a new phase in Iberian relations where regular meetings between Franco and Salazar played a fundamental role in this new political arrangement.Maria In√°cia Rezola, \\"The Franco‚ÄìSalazar Meetings: Foreign policy and Iberian relations during the Dictatorships (1942‚Äì1963)\\" E-Journal of Portuguese History (2008) 6#2 pp. 1‚Äì11. online The pact proved to be a decisive instrument in keeping the Iberian Peninsula out of Hitler's continental system. An additional protocol to the pact was signed on 29 July 1940, after the fall of France.Maria In√°cia Rezola, \\"The Franco‚ÄìSalazar Meetings: Foreign policy and Iberian relations during the Dictatorships (1942‚Äì1963)\\" E-Journal of Portuguese History (2008) 6#2 pp. 1‚Äì11. online Background The treaty was conceived in the final months of the Spanish Civil War. Portugal had provided support for the rebel Nationalist government of Burgos throughout the war, provided diplomatic support in the League of Nations and allowed 18,000 volunteers from Portugal to join the rebel army. Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar saw Francisco Franco as a kindred spirit, with both leaders being autocratic and against the socialist Republican Spain. Salazar also sought to make his country less reliant on the United Kingdom and so the Iberian Pact was one of many treaties signed between Portugal and foreign powers, including Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy, as a means of expanding Portuguese influence. Finally, Portugal was concerned with Spanish, whether Republican or Nationalist, ambitions to attack Portugal or the British-held Gibraltar. Spain's motivation was its desire to remain neutral in what it saw was an inevitable future war between the United Kingdom and Germany, and it hoped that a treaty would detach Portugal from British influence. Spain was willing to expel its foreign volunteers to guarantee that neutrality. On 16 September 1938, in the background of the Munich Crisis, Francoist Spain asked if Portugal would be willing to negotiate a treaty of reciprocal security. On the 19th, a non-aggression pact proposal was proposed, and on the 28th, a draft treaty was handed by Ambassador Nicol√°s Franco to the Portuguese government. After the end of the Catalonia Offensive, Salazar asked to write a broader and balanced draft treaty, which was proposed to the Spanish ambassador on 9 February 1939. That version became the treaty. Articles * Article 1 stated that the parties respect each other's borders and territories and would not conduct acts of aggression against each other. * Article 2 stated that the parties would not assist aggressors acting against each other. * Article 3 stated that the parties would not enter pacts or alliances with other powers that would threaten each other. * Article 4 stated that if a party entered a pact or alliance with another power, the articles of the treaty would be safeguarded. * Article 5 set the treaty duration at ten years and outlined a process for extension at ten-year intervals. * Article 6 stated that the treaty would not enter force until an exchange of ratifications had taken place. Aftermath The Iberian Pact declared mutual respect for borders and territories and declared that assistance would be denied to aggressors to the signatory nations. The pact did not call into question previous alliances, such as the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, and established that future pacts or alliance would safeguard Iberian interests and neutrality in the event of a general European war. The pact was originally planned to last ten years, but Article 5 provided for extensions for additional ten-year periods. An additional protocol to the pact was signed on 29 July 1940, following the fall of France, which reinforced the neutrality aspects of the treaty and required consultations and synchronisation of strategies to ensure common interests were protected. In December 1942, as the outcome of the war seemed to have turned to favour the Allies, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco G√≥mez-Jordana Sousa announced the Iberian Bloc, seeking the maintain the neutrality of Spain and Portugal. Throughout the Second World War, the pact was a significant factor in allowing Spain to withstand pressure from Germany to join the Axis powers, and it allowed Portugal more freedom with regard to its alliance with Britain. On 20 September 1948, the pact was renewed and expanded in a move that was seen as a victory for Spanish diplomacy as it showed that Spain was not alone in the postwar era, and that Portuguese membership in NATO, which was then being negotiated, did not render the pact moot. In 1958, the pact was expanded into a mutual defence treaty. The pact was expanded and renewed in 1970. In March 1975, after the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola attempted to invoke the pact to demand Spanish intervention. This was rejected by Franco. The Iberian Pact was replaced in 1977 by the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and Portugal after both countries had transitioned into democracies.

The upper plot uses raw data. In the lower plot, both the area and population data have been transformed using the logarithm function. In statistics, data transformation is the application of a deterministic mathematical function to each point in a data set‚Äîthat is, each data point zi is replaced with the transformed value yi = f(zi), where f is a function. Transforms are usually applied so that the data appear to more closely meet the assumptions of a statistical inference procedure that is to be applied, or to improve the interpretability or appearance of graphs. Nearly always, the function that is used to transform the data is invertible, and generally is continuous. The transformation is usually applied to a collection of comparable measurements. For example, if we are working with data on peoples' incomes in some currency unit, it would be common to transform each person's income value by the logarithm function. Motivation Guidance for how data should be transformed, or whether a transformation should be applied at all, should come from the particular statistical analysis to be performed. For example, a simple way to construct an approximate 95% confidence interval for the population mean is to take the sample mean plus or minus two standard error units. However, the constant factor 2 used here is particular to the normal distribution, and is only applicable if the sample mean varies approximately normally. The central limit theorem states that in many situations, the sample mean does vary normally if the sample size is reasonably large. However, if the population is substantially skewed and the sample size is at most moderate, the approximation provided by the central limit theorem can be poor, and the resulting confidence interval will likely have the wrong coverage probability. Thus, when there is evidence of substantial skew in the data, it is common to transform the data to a symmetric distribution before constructing a confidence interval. If desired, the confidence interval can then be transformed back to the original scale using the inverse of the transformation that was applied to the data. Data can also be transformed to make them easier to visualize. For example, suppose we have a scatterplot in which the points are the countries of the world, and the data values being plotted are the land area and population of each country. If the plot is made using untransformed data (e.g. square kilometers for area and the number of people for population), most of the countries would be plotted in tight cluster of points in the lower left corner of the graph. The few countries with very large areas and/or populations would be spread thinly around most of the graph's area. Simply rescaling units (e.g., to thousand square kilometers, or to millions of people) will not change this. However, following logarithmic transformations of both area and population, the points will be spread more uniformly in the graph. Another reason for applying data transformation is to improve interpretability, even if no formal statistical analysis or visualization is to be performed. For example, suppose we are comparing cars in terms of their fuel economy. These data are usually presented as \\"kilometers per liter\\" or \\"miles per gallon\\". However, if the goal is to assess how much additional fuel a person would use in one year when driving one car compared to another, it is more natural to work with the data transformed by applying the reciprocal function, yielding liters per kilometer, or gallons per mile.  In regression  Data transformation may be used as a remedial measure to make data suitable for modeling with linear regression if the original data violates one or more assumptions of linear regression. For example, the simplest linear regression models assume a linear relationship between the expected value of Y (the response variable to be predicted) and each independent variable (when the other independent variables are held fixed). If linearity fails to hold, even approximately, it is sometimes possible to transform either the independent or dependent variables in the regression model to improve the linearity. For example, addition of quadratic functions of the original independent variables may lead to a linear relationship with expected value of Y, resulting in a polynomial regression model, a special case of linear regression. Another assumption of linear regression is homoscedasticity, that is the variance of errors must be the same regardless of the values of predictors. If this assumption is violated (i.e. if the data is heteroscedastic), it may be possible to find a transformation of Y alone, or transformations of both X (the predictor variables) and Y, such that the homoscedasticity assumption (in addition to the linearity assumption) holds true on the transformed variables and linear regression may therefore be applied on these. Yet another application of data transformation is to address the problem of lack of normality in error terms. Univariate normality is not needed for least squares estimates of the regression parameters to be meaningful (see Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem). However confidence intervals and hypothesis tests will have better statistical properties if the variables exhibit multivariate normality. Transformations that stabilize the variance of error terms (i.e. those that address heteroscedaticity) often also help make the error terms approximately normal. Examples Equation: Y = a + bX :Meaning: A unit increase in X is associated with an average of b units increase in Y. Equation: \\\\log(Y) = a + bX (From exponentiating both sides of the equation: Y = e^a e^{bX}) :Meaning: A unit increase in X is associated with an average increase of b units in \\\\log(Y), or equivalently, Y increases on an average by a multiplicative factor of e^{b}!. For illustrative purposes, if base-10 logarithm were used instead of natural logarithm in the above transformation and the same symbols (a and b) are used to denote the regression coefficients, then a unit increase in X would lead to a 10^{b}times increase in Y on an average. If b were 1, then this implies a 10-fold increase in Y for a unit increase in X Equation: Y = a + b \\\\log(X) :Meaning: A k-fold increase in X is associated with an average of b \\\\times \\\\log(k)units increase in Y. For illustrative purposes, if base-10 logarithm were used instead of natural logarithm in the above transformation and the same symbols (a and b) are used to denote the regression coefficients, then a tenfold increase in X would result in an average increase of b \\\\times \\\\log_{10}(10) = b units in Y Equation: \\\\log(Y) = a + b \\\\log(X) (From exponentiating both sides of the equation: Y = e^a X^{b}) :Meaning: A k-fold increase in X is associated with a k^{b}multiplicative increase in Y on an average. Thus if X doubles, it would result in Y changing by a multiplicative factor of 2^{b}!. Alternative Generalized linear models (GLMs) provide a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. GLMs allow the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and allow the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. Common cases The logarithm and square root transformations are commonly used for positive data, and the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) transformation can be used for non-zero data. The power transformation is a family of transformations parameterized by a non-negative value Œª that includes the logarithm, square root, and multiplicative inverse as special cases. To approach data transformation systematically, it is possible to use statistical estimation techniques to estimate the parameter Œª in the power transformation, thereby identifying the transformation that is approximately the most appropriate in a given setting. Since the power transformation family also includes the identity transformation, this approach can also indicate whether it would be best to analyze the data without a transformation. In regression analysis, this approach is known as the Box‚ÄìCox technique. The reciprocal transformation, some power transformations such as the Yeo‚ÄìJohnson transformation, and certain other transformations such as applying the inverse hyperbolic sine, can be meaningfully applied to data that include both positive and negative values (the power transformation is invertible over all real numbers if Œª is an odd integer). However, when both negative and positive values are observed, it is sometimes common to begin by adding a constant to all values, producing a set of non-negative data to which any power transformation can be applied. A common situation where a data transformation is applied is when a value of interest ranges over several orders of magnitude. Many physical and social phenomena exhibit such behavior -- incomes, species populations, galaxy sizes, and rainfall volumes, to name a few. Power transforms, and in particular the logarithm, can often be used to induce symmetry in such data. The logarithm is often favored because it is easy to interpret its result in terms of \\"fold changes.\\" The logarithm also has a useful effect on ratios. If we are comparing positive quantities X and Y using the ratio X / Y, then if X < Y, the ratio is in the interval (0,1), whereas if X > Y, the ratio is in the half-line (1,‚àû), where the ratio of 1 corresponds to equality. In an analysis where X and Y are treated symmetrically, the log-ratio log(X / Y) is zero in the case of equality, and it has the property that if X is K times greater than Y, the log-ratio is the equidistant from zero as in the situation where Y is K times greater than X (the log-ratios are log(K) and ‚àílog(K) in these two situations). If values are naturally restricted to be in the range 0 to 1, not including the end-points, then a logit transformation may be appropriate: this yields values in the range (‚àí‚àû,‚àû). Transforming to normality 1\\\\. It is not always necessary or desirable to transform a data set to resemble a normal distribution. However, if symmetry or normality are desired, they can often be induced through one of the power transformations.; 2\\\\. A linguistic power function is distributed according to the Zipf-Mandelbrot law. The distribution is extremely spiky and leptokurtic, reason why researchers had to turn their backs to statistics to solve e.g. authorship attribution problems. Nevertheless, usage of Gaussian statistics is perfectly possible by applying data transformation. Van Droogenbroeck F.J., 'An essential rephrasing of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law to solve authorship attribution applications by Gaussian statistics' (2019) 3\\\\. To assess whether normality has been achieved after transformation, any of the standard normality tests may be used. A graphical approach is usually more informative than a formal statistical test and hence.a normal quantile plot is commonly used to assess the fit of a data set to a normal population. Alternatively, rules of thumb based on the sample skewness and kurtosis have also been proposed. Transforming to a uniform distribution or an arbitrary distribution If we observe a set of n values X1, ..., Xn with no ties (i.e., there are n distinct values), we can replace Xi with the transformed value Yi = k, where k is defined such that Xi is the kth largest among all the X values. This is called the rank transform, and creates data with a perfect fit to a uniform distribution. This approach has a population analogue. Using the probability integral transform, if X is any random variable, and F is the cumulative distribution function of X, then as long as F is invertible, the random variable U = F(X) follows a uniform distribution on the unit interval [0,1]. From a uniform distribution, we can transform to any distribution with an invertible cumulative distribution function. If G is an invertible cumulative distribution function, and U is a uniformly distributed random variable, then the random variable G‚àí1(U) has G as its cumulative distribution function. Putting the two together, if X is any random variable, F is the invertible cumulative distribution function of X, and G is an invertible cumulative distribution function then the random variable G‚àí1(F(X)) has G as its cumulative distribution function. Variance stabilizing transformations Many types of statistical data exhibit a \\"variance-on-mean relationship\\", meaning that the variability is different for data values with different expected values. As an example, in comparing different populations in the world, the variance of income tends to increase with mean income. If we consider a number of small area units (e.g., counties in the United States) and obtain the mean and variance of incomes within each county, it is common that the counties with higher mean income also have higher variances. A variance-stabilizing transformation aims to remove a variance-on-mean relationship, so that the variance becomes constant relative to the mean. Examples of variance-stabilizing transformations are the Fisher transformation for the sample correlation coefficient, the square root transformation or Anscombe transform for Poisson data (count data), the Box‚ÄìCox transformation for regression analysis, and the arcsine square root transformation or angular transformation for proportions (binomial data). While commonly used for statistical analysis of proportional data, the arcsine square root transformation is not recommended because logistic regression or a logit transformation are more appropriate for binomial or non-binomial proportions, respectively, especially due to decreased type-II error.  Transformations for multivariate data  Univariate functions can be applied point-wise to multivariate data to modify their marginal distributions. It is also possible to modify some attributes of a multivariate distribution using an appropriately constructed transformation. For example, when working with time series and other types of sequential data, it is common to difference the data to improve stationarity. If data generated by a random vector X are observed as vectors Xi of observations with covariance matrix Œ£, a linear transformation can be used to decorrelate the data. To do this, the Cholesky decomposition is used to express Œ£ = A A'. Then the transformed vector Yi = A‚àí1Xi has the identity matrix as its covariance matrix.

It is Suzuki's first color film. Cast * Koji Wada as Sadao Matsudaira * Chikako Hosokawa as Ikuyo Matsudaira, his grandmother * Emiko Azuma as Yuki Maebara * Mayumi Shimizu as Kazuko Izeki * Kaku Takashina as Sanshiro Izeki, Kazuko's father * Eitaro Ozawa as Kanjuro Mizoguchi, Sadao's uncle * Hiroshi Kondo as Nanjo * Toppa Utsumi as Uchiyama * Saburo Hiromatsu as Kodaira  Plot  Sadao, a young construction worker, believes himself to be an orphan and in spite of his youthful tempestuousness he is nonetheless a model of honesty and moral integrity: he introduces himself by crashing into the office of a company president in order to claim the indemnity that he owes the foreman's daughter because he caused the man's death by dangerous driving. Shortly after this altercation, Sadao learns that he actually is the only heir of a noble and rich family from Awaji Island. A messenger tries to convince him by all means to accept the inheritance, but Sadao's moral integrity prevents him from leaving his friends and he refuses to accept this sudden ticket to fortune and high society. When the messenger realizes that the young man is immune to the material temptations such an offer carries, he manages to persuade him with the promise that he will be reunited with his mother. Pressured by his buddies' enthusiasm, Sadao gives in and leaves for Awaji, where he is welcomed by his aristocratic grandmother. The obaasan (\\"granny\\", as he defiantly calls her) is shocked by her grandson's disarming sincerity, a far cry from the hypocritical manners inherent in any high society member. When Sadao finds out that the promise to join his mother was just a trick to attract him to the island, he devotes all his efforts to finding her himself. At the same time spends the family fortune on building a public park and a western-style youth hostel on lands owned by the family. However, he is unaware that a shady speculator has plans to appropriate these lands, and that the businessman's girlfriend is none other than Sadao's mother.

The mesa summit is located in North Table Mountain Park, north by east (bearing 9¬∞) of downtown Golden, Colorado, United States, in Jefferson County. Mesa The most distinctive feature of the mesa is its nearly flat cap that was formed by ancient Paleocene lava flows. It is separated from companion South Table Mountain, which consists of the same geologic formation, by Clear Creek. North Table Mountain is a popular scenic and recreational destination in the Denver metro area, and it is preserved as public open space by Jefferson County and the Access Fund. Recent and ongoing projects by Jefferson County Open Space have resulted in the construction of several new trails and eliminated large numbers of unofficial trails. Geology Two early Paleocene lava flows cap North Table Mountain. North Table Mountain is underlain by sedimentary rocks of the Denver Formation, which spans the interval from latest Cretaceous to early Paleocene time. An exposure of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary layer has been identified and documented on nearby South Table Mountain.Kauffman, E.G., Upchurch, G.R. Jr., and Nichols, D.J., 2005. The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary at South Table Mountain near Golden, Colorado. In: Extinction Events in Earth History, Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences, vol. 30, p. 365-392. Three prominent, columnar jointed, cliff-forming lava flows can be seen on North Table Mountain, one exposed part way up the northwest slope, and two that form its cap. The Ralston Dike, a body of intrusive monzonite located about to the northwest, probably represents the volcanic vent from which the flows erupted.Van Horn, R. 1957. Bedrock geology of the Golden Quadrangle, Colorado. U.S. Geological Survey, Map GQ-103. The flows are about 62 to 64 million years old according to radiometric dating, which places them in the early Paleocene epoch. Generally referred to as basaltic, they are classified either as monzonite (the lowest flow) and latite (the upper two flows), or as shoshonite. They contain the minerals augite, plagioclase, and olivine altered to serpentine, with accessory sanidine, orthoclase, apatite, magnetite, and biotite.Kile D.E., 2004. Zeolites and associated minerals from the Table Mountains near Golden, Jefferson County, Colorado. Rocks and Minerals, vol. 79, no. 4, p. 218-238. Zeolite Both North and South Table Mountain are known for the wide variety of zeolite minerals that occur in vesicles in the second flow. These include analcime, thomsonite, mesolite, chabazite, and others. Excellent specimens of the Table Mountain zeolites can be seen at the nearby Mines Museum of Earth Science.Bartos, P.J. 2004. Table Mountain zeolites: The Colorado School of Mines perspective. Rocks and Minerals, vol. 79, no. 4, p. 240-244. Wildlife Among the animals known to frequent the mesa through time, according to local newspaper accounts , are mountain sheep, coyotes, mountain lions, plenty of deer, elk, rattlesnakes, and more. Of these, most except for the mountain sheep continue to live upon the mountain today. Several areas are closed seasonally to protect several species of nesting raptors. In the late 19th century bees also nested in the cliffs. Fire On July 22, 2005, more than 200 acres (81 hectares) were set ablaze. Two fifteen-year-old boys were charged with first-degree felony arson and misdemeanor fourth-degree arson for lighting fireworks. They claimed to have shot off a Roman Candle, which started several small spot fires at the base of the north face. They fled the scene, but an area resident had witnessed the act and reported them to the police after the fire escalated, and they were soon found. The fire was contained later the same day, but it was summer with dry prairie grass conditions, so the fire had spread rapidly. It only burned one structure, a toolshed, and some other small miscellaneous pieces of property, but it cost more than 100,000 dollars (U.S. currency) to contain and extinguish. Pictures Located on the west side of the mesa is the high point, Lichen Peak (6555 ft).

The street is the location of many banks such as AIB and Ulster Bank. It is close to Ireland's oldest university, Trinity College, Dublin, founded in 1592, the entrance to which is a popular meeting spot. The street takes its name from a dam built across the Poddle River to provide water power for milling. It appears later as Dammastrete and Damask-street. There was a medieval church of St. Mary del Dam which was demolished in the seventeenth century. Sir Maurice Eustace, Lord Chancellor of Ireland 1660‚Äì1665, built his townhouse, Damask, on the site. During the day, the street is very busy, due to its prime location in the city centre. It is a five-minute walk to the shopping area of Grafton Street and ten minutes from O'Connell Street, Dublin's two most famous thoroughfares. The Temple Bar area of the city is located directly north of the street. Daly's Club was founded in the 1750s at numbers 1-3 Dame Street and remained there until 1791, when it moved to College Green.T. H. S.

The book alternates Young's foibles with his ruminations about the differences in culture and society between the United States and England, and specifically between New York City and London. The book depicts Young's relationship with various British and American journalists, including Julie Burchill, Anthony Haden- Guest, Tina Brown and Harold Evans (who at one point threatens to sue him) and Vanity Fair's own Graydon Carter. Young also describes awkward run-ins with American celebrities including Nathan Lane, Mel Gibson and Diana Ross. Throughout the book, Young describes being tormented by his friend \\"Alex de Silva\\" (speculated to be Sacha Gervasi), a former colleague of Young's who manages to succeed in America in every way that Young does not. The title of Young's book is a parody of the title of Dale Carnegie's 1937 perennial bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People; a parody by Irving Tressler titled How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was also published that same year.Time, \\"Books: Funnymen\\", September 20, 1937 Young's book does not reference either Carnegie's or Tressler's works.

Adaptations The book was adapted into a one-man play that played on London's West End for several months each in 2003 and 2004. Young was initially played by Jack Davenport, then by Young himself. A feature-length film adaptation, also titled How to Lose Friends & Alienate People, was released in October 2008. It is directed by Robert B. Weide and stars Simon Pegg, Kirsten Dunst, and Megan Fox. The film is loosely based on the book, turning the plot into more of a straightforward romantic comedy. Sequel Young wrote a 2006 sequel, The Sound of No Hands Clapping, which chronicles his failure as a Hollywood screenwriter in the years after he left New York.

Brownell was born in St. Charles, Illinois, the fifth of six children of Eugene A. and Esther Burr Baker Brownell. He grew up in St. Charles, where he graduated from St. Charles High School. Education Brownell attended five universities: the University of Washington (1906-1907); Northwestern University (1907-1909); Harvard University (1909-1913); University of T√ºbingen (1912-1913), and Cambridge University, England (1913). While at Harvard Brownell took classes with Josiah Royce and George Santayana, and met William James, who had already retired from Harvard. Brownell received a B.A. in philosophy from Northwestern in 1910, after completing his last year of undergraduate work at Harvard. He received an M.A. in philosophy from Harvard in 1911. In 1912-1913, as a recipient of the James Walker Traveling Fellow in Philosophy (awarded by Harvard), he attended T√ºbingen University in Germany and Cambridge University, where he became acquainted with Bertrand Russell.  Personal  In 1916, Brownell married Helena Maxwell, whom he later divorced. His second marriage was to Adelaide Howard in 1933; they had one son, Eugene Howard Brownell, who was born on September 9, 1939. 1910s During World War I, Brownell served as an enlisted man and officer, first in the United States Army, then the U.S. Navy. (He was in the National Guard between 1916 and 1926.) He served both in the Mexican Border Campaign and World War I. He began writing poetry during this period, which was published in such magazines as Poetry,\\" The Dial,\\" and \\"The New Republic.\\" Upon his return from Europe in 1913, Brownell worked as a cub reporter for the \\"Chicago Tribune.\\" From 1914-1917 he lived in Emporia, Kansas, where he was an instructor in English at the Kansas State Normal College and edited a journal, \\"Teaching.\\" From 1919 to 1920, Brownell was an Assistant Professor of English at the University of Idaho. Returning to Chicago in 1920, he worked until 1921 as an editorial writer for the Chicago Daily News. 1920s In 1921 Brownell joined the faculty of Northwestern University, where he would spend the duration of his academic career. Initially, he was a lecturer in editorial writing and journalism, but soon began teaching courses in contemporary thought and philosophy. Brownell‚Äôs course in Contemporary Thought, one of the first of its kind in the United States, was intended to help students organize fragments of their educational experience into an intelligible whole. It consisted of weekly lectures by prominent individuals with expertise in natural sciences, biology, psychology, sociology, history, economics, art, religion and philosophy. Brownell believed that the ‚Äúhuman community‚Äù was breaking down in part because students and others did not understand that life itself was fragmented. By helping students integrate their educational experiences, Brownell believed he was helping to mitigate the demise of the small community. In 1926, Brownell published The New Universe,\\" which enumerated his beliefs, and in 1929 he edited a twelve volume series entitle \\"Man and His World,\\" which included 60 lectures that had been given in his Contemporary Thought course. 1930s In 1933, Brownell published \\"Earth is Enough: An Essay on Religious Realism.\\" During the 1930s Brownell became acquainted with Arthur E. Morgan, chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and edited Morgan‚Äôs book, The Small Community.\\" From 1936 to 1939 he served as an agricultural advisor to the United States Department of Agriculture. As a supervising editor for Harper & Brothers during the 1940s, he edited several books that were designed to integrate various fields of specialized knowledge. In addition to his long and distinguished connection with Northwestern, Brownell was also a visiting lecturer at other universities including the University of Kansas City, the University of Chicago, the University of Wisconsin, and the Garrett Biblical Institute. He traveled extensively. Among his trips were a tour of the Galapagos Islands and an expedition to Cocos Island as the guest of his friend Commander E.F. MacDonald Jr., the Chairman of the Zenith Corporation; a six-month sojourn in the interior of Guatemala; a summer in Tahiti; a trip to Isle Royale, Michigan, as a member of the Isle Royale Archeological Expedition; and various cruises in the Caribbean. With Frank Lloyd Wright in 1937, he wrote \\"Architecture and Modern Life\\"; and in 1939 he wrote \\"Art in Action,\\" explaining his views about the humanities. 1940s and 1950s In 1941, Brownell wrote The Philosopher in Chaos, which was an attempt to make head and tail of the modern world. From 1944 to 1947, Brownell resided in Montana, where he directed a community service project, the Montana Study, which, though initially financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, was jointly sponsored by the Humanities Division of the Rockefeller Foundation and the University of Montana. The Montana Study entailed a program of teaching and field studies in American culture that emphasized the western region of the United States. Brownell's book, \\"The Human Community,\\" published in 1950, is based upon the Montana Study. Supported by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and Northwestern University, Brownell continued his community service work in other areas until 1951. He also served as the first director of the Division of Area Services at Southern Illinois University from 1952 to 1954; and organized Southern Illinois's Department of Community Development, which was initiated to help revitalize many communities in southern Illinois. Upon his retirement from Northwestern in 1953, Brownell became Emeritus Professor of Philosophy. After fully retiring from academic and administrative work in 1954, Brownell spent the remaining years of his life in Fairhope, Alabama. He continued writing, in 1958 publishing The Other Illinois, which was based upon his work at Southern Illinois University. Baker Brownell died on April 5, 1965.

Based on the dugout, it was the principal traditional fishing boat of the bay until superseded by the bugeye and the skipjack. However, it is most famous as a racing sailboat, and races continue to be held. History The history of the log canoe is closely tied to the development of the oystering industry on the bay. In pre-power days, the log canoe was an inexpensive craft which could be assembled without recourse to shipbuilders; before the dredge was made legal in 1865, the log canoe was sufficient to the needs of oyster tongers. It did not have the pulling power necessary for dredging, however, its log construction was combined with characteristics of other vessels to form the first bugeyes, a much larger and more powerful vessel. As motor power became available, watermen who were not dredging gradually abandoned sail power; also, the supplies of suitable timber were gradually exhausted. Log canoes were often converted to motor power, and new workboats (such as the Chesapeake Bay deadrise) were motored from the start and used frame construction instead of logs. Many of the existing log canoes have suffered some conversion of this sort during their lifetimes. Over the same period, however, the ad-hoc racing of canoes evolved into a semi-formal sport, and boats began being purpose- built for racing. From 1885 onward various clubs and associations sponsored organized races. This continues to the present, and racing canoes have been built as recently as 1974. Hull construction Log canoe hull showing construction, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum The typical log canoe is constructed from three to nine logs joined lengthwise and carved to form the lower portion of the hull. Additional height is obtained with smaller pieces fitted together and joined to the outermost (or \\"wing\\") logs. The resulting hull is sharp-sterned and shallow, and a centerboard is added which pierces the center (keel) log. Details of construction, particularly at the stem and stern, varied over the region. Also, Virginia boat builders did not use models, whereas most Maryland builders would start from a half-model of the hull. Surviving log canoes range in length from 27 to 35 ft. on-deck. One example is the buyboat F.D. Crockett at the Deltaville Maritime Museum in Virginia. Rigging Rigging varied considerably. Log canoes had one or two masts. Two-masted boats on the Chesapeake‚Äînot just log canoes‚Äîwere often provided with a mast step to allow sailing with just one of the two sails. Typical later log canoes were two-masted, vaguely resembling a modern ketch rig. The masts were always steeply raked and unstayed, and the jib was flown from a bowsprit. The rigging of the sails themselves took several characteristic and unusual forms called a triangular \\"sprit-boomed leg-of- mutton.\\" The main and fore sail were not attached to the boom at the foot, but instead attached only at the clew. A tackle attached to the mast provided the force necessary to shape the sail. One advantage of the sprit boom is that the sail is self-vanging, that is, the boom does not rise or fall depending on the set of the sail. The sheeting force is less, because the sheet does not have to supply downward pull to control the boom as with a gaff-rigged boat. This evolved further to the \\"goosewing\\" form, in which the sail became trapezoidal. The pointed clew was replaced by a vertical spar, called a club. The club attached to the aft end of the boom. This allowed for more sail area between the masts than for a triangular sail. The rigging of the jib was similarly unusual, but followed 19th century working-boat practice. There are several terms for a jib with a boom on the foot: balanced jib, club-footed jib, and self-tending jib. On a club-footed jib, the foot was attached on a spar, and the balance point of this spar attached to the end of the bowsprit with a line or fixture. This allowed for a larger jib which could serve as something akin to a spinnaker when running. Working sailors were less worried about the spinnaker effect than the fact that a properly trimmed balanced jib doesn't need any quick sheeting when tacking: hence the term \\"self-tending.\\" A final characteristic feature was the use of hiking boards to keep the boat from overturning. These were long, flat boards which hooked at one end under the cockpit and stuck sideways over the opposite gunwale. Crewmembers climb out onto these boards to counterbalance the force of the sails, thus preventing the boat from heeling over. These were particularly important to racing canoes, whose sail area and lack of ballast made them hopelessly tender without such counterbalancing.

Early life Jaffee, who was Jewish, was born to Jewish parents who had emigrated from Russia in 1896. He grew up in the Crotona Park section of The Bronx, where he played baseball with future Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg. He briefly attended DeWitt Clinton High School, but dropped out after failing to make the varsity baseball team. Career At age 14, Jaffee took up skating at the Gay Blades of Iceland rink (which later became the Roseland Ballroom). Rather than pay the 75-cent admission fee, he worked as an ice cleaner to gain admission. He entered numerous skating races in the 1920s. He finally won the Silver Skates two-mile race in 1926, won the national five- mile event the following year, and qualified for the U.S. Olympic team in 1928. At the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Jaffee finished fourth in the 5000-meter skate, the best finish by an American in that event to that date. In the later 10,000-meter race, Jaffee was leading the competition, having outskated Norwegian defending world champion Bernt Evensen in their heat, when rising temperatures thawed the ice. In a controversial ruling, the Norwegian referee canceled the entire competition. Although the International Olympic Committee reversed the referee's decision and awarded Jaffee the gold medal, the International Skating Union later overruled the IOC and restored the ruling. Evensen, for his part, publicly said that Jaffee should be awarded the gold medal, but that never happened. That year he also set a world record in the mile (2:30.6). Jaffee competed again at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. At the time, Jaffee recalled, there were signs in Lake Placid that said \\"No dogs or Jews allowed\\". There, he won gold medals in both the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races. In the 10,000-meter race, Jaffee won in a thrilling finish by leaping across the finish line ahead of Frank Stack and Ivar Ballangrud. In December 1932 his manager has announced that Jaffee, and also Ivar Ballangrud, became professional. Jaffee served on the American board for the Second Maccabiah, along with Benny Leonard and Nat Holman. During the Great Depression, the unemployed Jaffee ended up on bread lines and was forced to pawn his Olympic and other medals for $3500. He obtained a job on Wall Street, he tried to redeem his medals, but the pawn shop went out of business, meaning that he never saw the medals again. In 1934, he worked as Winter Sports Director at Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel, and set a world record there by skating 25 miles in 1:26:01. breaking the 30-year-old record by five minutes. Jaffee appeared in a full-page ad for Camel cigarettes in 1934, entitled \\"It Takes Healthy Nerves for Jaffee to be the World's Champion Skater; Steady Smokers Turn to Camels\\". Jaffee was elected to the United States Skating Hall of Fame in 1940 and the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1979. He died in San Diego in 1981.

The route runs from DE 41 in Hockessin east to U.S. Route 13 Business (US 13 Bus.) in downtown Wilmington. The route passes through suburban areas of Wilmington such as Lancaster Pike, intersecting DE 100 and DE 141\\\\. DE 48 continues into Wilmington as Lancaster Avenue and intersects DE 2, where it splits into the one-way pair of Lancaster Avenue eastbound and Second Street westbound. Upon reaching downtown Wilmington, the route intersects Interstate 95 (I-95)/US 202 and DE 4 before continuing to the eastern terminus. What is now DE 48 was originally built as the Lancaster Pike in 1817, a turnpike that was to connect Wilmington to the Gap and Newport Turnpike. The turnpike became county maintained in 1877. The Lancaster Pike became DE 48 by 1936, with the route continuing east through Wilmington to the Wilmington-Penns Grove Ferry across the Delaware River, where it connected to Route 48 in Penns Grove, New Jersey. The ferry was discontinued in 1949 and the eastern terminus of DE 48 was cut back to its current location by 1952. Route description DE 48 westbound past Centerville Road west of Wilmington DE 48 begins at an intersection with DE 41 in Hockessin, heading southeast on Lancaster Pike, a two-lane undivided road. The road runs through wooded areas and residential development, crossing Loveville Road and Hyde Run before curving east and gaining a second westbound lane for trucks as it descends a hill. The route widens into a four-lane divided highway before crossing the Wilmington and Western Railroad at-grade and Red Clay Creek. The road passes residential areas and business parks as it crosses Centerville Road. DE 48 crosses Little Mill Creek and comes to an intersection with DE 100/DE 141, at which point DE 100 forms a concurrency with DE 48\\\\. The two routes head southeast as a four- lane undivided road, crossing Chestnut Run and passing through residential and commercial areas. The road crosses an East Penn Railroad line at-grade and runs to the north of a cemetery, with DE 100 splitting from DE 48 by turning south on South Dupont Road as it passes south of the Cab Calloway School of the Arts and Charter School of Wilmington. DE 48 continues into the city of Wilmington as Lancaster Avenue and heads into areas of homes and businesses, with the eastbound direction narrowing to one lane at an intersection with Greenhill Avenue. Following this intersection, the route crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line on a bridge. The road narrows to two lanes and passes to the north of another cemetery. The route intersects DE 2, which follows the one-way pair of Lincoln Street northbound and Union Street southbound, in the Union Park Gardens neighborhood. DE 48 westbound past Greenhill Avenue in Wilmington At this point, DE 48 itself splits into a one- way pair that follows Lancaster Avenue eastbound and West Second Street westbound, with westbound DE 48 using westbound DE 2 (North Union Street) to get from West Second Street to Lancaster Avenue. The one-way pair carries two lanes in each direction. DE 48 continues into downtown Wilmington, where it crosses under a viaduct carrying I-95/US 202, with ramp connections to and from the southbound direction of I-95/US 202 via Jackson Street, which parallels I-95/US 202 to the west. Upon crossing under I-95/US 202, a westbound ramp to I-95/US 202 complements the eastbound direction of DE 48, with the road becoming Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway. Westbound DE 48 remains along one-way West Second Street, which carries three lanes. DE 48 intersects the eastern terminus of DE 4, which provides access to DE 48 from the northbound direction of I-95/US 202\\\\. The one-way pair continues further into the downtown, passing to the south of the Orlando J. George, Jr. Campus of Delaware Technical Community College, and runs a short distance to the north of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line. The route intersects the southbound direction of US 13 Bus., which shifts west from North King Street to South Market Street where it intersects DE 48\\\\. At this point, the westbound direction of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard ends. Following the intersection with US 13 Bus. southbound, DE 48 follows the one-way pair of Front Street eastbound and East Second Street westbound. Along this stretch, the route passes to the north of Wilmington Station along the Northeast Corridor that serves Amtrak and SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line, with the train station's parking garage and the Wilmington Bus Station serving Greyhound Lines buses located between Front Street and East Second Street west of the French Street intersection. DE 48 reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with the northbound direction of US 13 Bus., which follows Walnut Street, west of the Wilmington Transit Center serving DART First State buses. DE 48 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 38,923 vehicles at the DE 4 intersection to a low of 11,223 vehicles at the Loveville Road intersection near Hockessin. The entire length of DE 48 is part of the National Highway System. History The Wilmington Turnpike Company was founded on October 23, 1809 to build a turnpike from Wilmington to the Pennsylvania border, connecting to the Gap and Newport Turnpike. The turnpike was completed in 1817 at a cost of $39,549.97. The turnpike became known as the Lancaster Pike and was surfaced with stone. The Wilmington Turnpike Company operated the Lancaster Pike until 1877 when they abandoned the road. The turnpike's charter was repealed and the road was then under the control of the county levy court. The road leading to the Wilmington-Penns Grove Ferry across the Delaware River between Wilmington and Penns Grove, New Jersey was completed as a state highway by 1931. By 1936, the Lancaster Pike became a part of DE 48\\\\. In addition, the route continued through Wilmington on Lincoln Street, Fourth Street, and Christiana Avenue to the ferry across the Delaware River to Penns Grove, New Jersey, which linked DE 48 to Route 48 in New Jersey. In 1939, DE 48 was rebuilt between DE 41 and Centre Road, eliminating curves and grades. In 1949, the Wilmington-Penns Grove Ferry was discontinued. DE 48 was realigned onto Lancaster Avenue to continue to US 13/US 202 (now US 13 Bus.), its current eastern terminus, by 1952. By 1990, DE 100 was realigned to follow a portion of DE 48, bypassing a part of Dupont Road. DE 48 was widened into a divided highway at the DE 141 intersection by 1996. The divided highway was extended west to Centerville Road a year later.

Description  The Antelope system employs a battery of four Sky Sword I (TC-1) missiles mounted atop a wheeled vehicle (such as a truck or humvee). The system can either be employed as a stand-alone point defense system or as part of an integrated area air defense system. The Antelope system collectively includes targeting, guidance, communications components as well as the missiles themselves. It was developed beginning in 1995 as an outgrowth of the Tien Chien-I missile development program. The precise operating range of the Antelope system is variously reported as 9 km, 18 km, and \\"4 miles\\". The system has a crew of two, one gunner and one observer. The system can be controlled from the truck's cabin or from a mobile control console that can be located up to 70m away from the vehicle to increase operator safety and survivability. The Antelope system's TC-1L interceptors employ infrared guidance and the system is similar in design to the United States-made Chaparral system which historically was a mainstay of Taiwan's SHORAD network. It can be used to intercept low-flying helicopters, fighter aircraft, attack aircraft, and bombers. The system can engage targets on the move.  CS/MPQ-78 radar  The system's CS/MPQ-78 radar was developed in the early 1990s and is a 3D pulse doppler radar with full look down-shoot down capability.

It was constructed in 1663 by Subahdar Shaista Khan. It is on Hakim Habibur Rahman lane on the bank of the Buriganga River. Basically it was built to accommodate some officials and Shaista Khan's expanding family. Chhota Katra is slightly smaller than Bara Katra, but similar in plan and it is about 185 metres east to it. The ruins of Chhota Katra, amidst urban encroachment. Origin Katara is a form of cellular dormitory built around an oblong courtyard; the form originated in Persia, and like many other things Persian and middle-Asian that the Mughals introduced in this subcontinent, this was copied in Northern India, the home of some of the rulers, members of the Royal Court and the nobility. However, the term may have been derived from Arabic word Katara which meant colonnaded building, or could be a corrupt French word used for a residential quarter. Other synonyms of it are Chuttre (French) and Chatrra (Hindi), both meaning Umbrella, were used for a place that sheltered Pilgrims. History Chhota Katra was built in between 1663 and 1671. During the first reign of Shaista Khan, then Subahdar of Bengal and a patron of civic and religious building that gave to the architectural style appropriately named after him. Since the shift of Mughal capital in 1713, the Katra started to lose its importance along with the city, though the Naib Nazim Jissarat Khan briefly stayed here before his palace, or rather a mansion of which nothing much is now left, was built in 1765 in Nimtali in city just overcoming anarchy. The British made some additions to the Choto Katra, once used by the first English Medium School in Dhaka (1816) set up by Padre Leonardo, and then the first normal school (1857). The Nawabs of Dhaka rented the places as a coal and lime go-down for sometime. Accounts by Charles D'oyle in 1822 testify to the beauty of the partly surviving Bara Katra, plundered by the poor inhabitants who are still there. Attempts by the archaeology department in the past to take over the structure and restore it to its original glory have been unsuccessful, mainly thwarted by the people who are running a madrasa by illegally occupying a part of the structure. Besides this Katra, there was several more such cellular structures mainly used as inns or residential enclaves, for example Maya Katra, Muqim Katra, Nawab Katra, etc. These Katras are the few reminiscences of residential quarters in Dhaka or elsewhere in Bengal built during Mughal period. Architecture=Exterior The Katra is rectangular in plan, 101.20m X 92.05m externally and 81.07m X 69.19m internally. The thickness of the outer walls is 0.91m to 1.00m and the maximum thickness of the bastion walls is 1.22m. It has two gateways - to the north and south. The southern one is the main entrance. Both the gateways, though much altered recently are still in dire condition. there are two octagonal towers in the two outer corners of the south wall of the structure. The structures around the courtyard have undergone much renovation, reconstruction and repair. It is evident that the structure has lost much of its original given it some durability. Many modern extensions were also added to the original building. The three storied gateway on the river side has assumed some colonial features. The triple windows and the lofty angle towers reflect the colonial influence during subsequent restoration. Interior Inside, there is a tomb of Champa Bibi, but there is no correct history regarding her identity. There was a small mosque within its enclosure which is ruined. The one-dome square Mausoleum of Champa Bibi, a listed building now, was within its enclosure which was razed to the ground by Padre Shepherd. It was later reconstructed by the archaeologists, but is now lost within mazes of shops at Champatali. As depicted by Charles D'Oyle's (who mistook the mausoleum for a mosque) it appears to have been a multi-foil saucer dome with slim corner spandrels. Champa Bibi was either Shaista Khan's daughter or a local concubine whom he later married. Shaista Khan's Bengali heirs from Champa Bibi's lineage used to live in Choto Katra for many years as Shaista Khan owned Katra.

It specializes in food and beverage manufacturing and distribution. The company's main offices are located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. According to Almarai literature, the dairy company - founded by Irish Agri Pioneers Alastair and Paddy McGuckian - began with 350 cows, before expanding its operations dramatically over the past three decades. The company is now responsible for more than 200,000 cows globally and is the world's largest vertically integrated dairy company. The company notably partnered with PepsiCo from 2009 onwards and has been responsible for acquiring a number of large businesses. History=Early years (1977-2010) Almarai started its operations in 1977 by Irish brothers Alastair McGuckian and Paddy McGuckian and Prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al-Kabir (who is currently the chairman of the board). During the early years of the company's history, there was little infrastructure for the production and sale of milk in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al-Kabir recognized that the area and the wider Middle East could benefit from higher quality milk production and logistics. Almarai then set up a number of facilities in regions across Saudi Arabia, which initially helped local farmers produce and distribute milk. During the early 1990s, Almarai entered a period of restructuring and reinvestment that took it from a decentralized to a centralized structure. Five decentralized processing plants were replaced with a central processing plant. Ten small dairy farms that were scattered across Saudi Arabia were replaced with four large dairy farms in Al Kharj in the central region. Almarai Head Office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Savola owns a quarter of its shares and the rest has been on the market since 2006. In 2005, Almarai entered a new phase, transformed from a company with limited liability to a joint-stock company. The move was part of the company's IPO, as they floated 30% of the company shares on the Saudi Arabian stock market, the Tadawul. All shareholders, including The Savola Group, diluted their shares for the IPO to take place. However exact figures were never revealed how the 30% of shares were divided. In 2006, Almarai began to diversify its portfolio by pushing promotions on other dairy products and not just milk. It held a cheddar cheese product promotion throughout the Middle East to try and increase the number of households that bought the cheese on a regular basis. At the beginning of 2007, Almarai signed a memorandum of understanding with the authorized partners in Western Bakeries Company Limited, to acquire up to 100% ownership of these companies. And then raise the capital of the company to (1.090) million Saudi riyals. The current capital is SR 8 billion. In 2009, Almarai and PepsiCo announced that they would be forming a joint venture, International Dairy and Juice Limited, known as IDJ. They then announced that they would be acquiring Egypt's International Company for Agro-Industrial Projects (Beyti). The company specializes in dairy and juice products, including plain and flavored ultra-high-temperature (UHT) milk, flavored yogurt, cheese and a variety of juices. The brand name was known throughout Egypt and continued to operate under its name as a subsidiary of the IDJ joint venture. During that year, Almarai also moved into the poultry market. This was following the acquisition of Hail Agricultural Development Co. The lucrative poultry business was purchased for $253.2 million in cash and stock to complete the takeover. As part of the PepsiCo partnership, Almarai also moved into the Jordanian drinks market. IDJ acquired a 75% stake in Teeba, a leading Jordanian dairy producer. This helped strengthen Almarai's presence in the country's dairy market, but also Pepsi used the acquisition to launch Tropicana orange juice drinks into the Jordanian market. The expansion and growth of the dairy producer continued into 2010, when it was announced they planned on expanding its operations into Pakistan. The likelihood was that Almarai would invest in the country's dairy market through acquisition. Recent history (2011-present) Almarai announced in 2011 that they would be investing heavily in Saudi Arabia to increase dairy production in the country. Arab News reported that they would be creating an additional 12,000 jobs in the country over the next five years. The joint venture with Pepsi continued to grow, when Reuters announced that both companies would invest a total of $345 million in Egypt's agriculture industry. It was seen as a positive move in the country, following 3 years of economic turmoil following the 2011 revolution in the country. During the same year, they also made an announcement that they would be acquiring a large farming company, based in Argentina. By 2014, the company controlled 44 percent of the dairy market in the Persian Gulf region. Between 2006 and 2016, the company grew rapidly. It was announced that their total staffing numbers had reached 38,000, which means the company created over thirty thousand jobs in a decade. Later in 2016, Almarai announced that it would be acquiring land in the United States to expand its farming operations. The land would be purchased in a number of locations, predominantly in California, USA. In total they acquired around 14,000 acres. In 2017, it was announced that Savola would reduce its stake in Almarai by 2 percent. The Kingdom's sovereign wealth fund announced in late 2017, that they would be acquiring a large share in Almarai, increasing their share to 16.32 percent. Bloomberg valued their investment at $2.4 billion. It was said to be a move by the Saudi Arabian wealth fund to diversify its portfolio away from oil investments. The move proved to be positive with investors, as the shares rose 4 percent following the announcement. In 2018, it was announced that Almarai was the most popular brand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the third year in a row. This was according to a poll carried out by the British market research company, YouGov. Later that year, it was announced that Almarai announced plans to invest $2.8 billion in Middle Eastern production facilities. Between 2019 and 2023, Almarai was said to be focusing on the production facilities at farms in the region, but also its distribution and transportation in the region, so it would be easier to expand geographically throughout the Middle East.  Facilities and sustainability  In June 2012, Almarai invited a number of representatives from both the International press and also financial leaders to visit their main facility in Saudi Arabia, located in Al Kharj. The facility is around 60 miles from the Saudi capital of Riyadh. The Al Kharj facility includes dairy and juice processing operations, along with a bakery facility. It also has the region's first infant nutrition factory. CNN reported on the innovative technology used at the Al Kharj facility, with each cow needing an estimated 3 litres of water each day in the middle of the Saudi Arabian desert, the company uses a method known as the Californian model to run huge diary productions in some of the driest regions across the globe.

Feigner (pronounced FAY- ner) was born in Walla Walla, Washington as Myrle Vernon King. He was a softball player for much of his early life, and turned his attention to the sport full-time following an enlistment in the U.S. Marine Corps. He first assembled his four-man team, known as \\"The King and His Court\\", in 1946 and took on all comers, first in the Pacific Northwest and then around the country. The team was known for performing tricks that entertained the audience. The King and His Court touring team played over ten thousand softball games in a hundred countries from the late 1940s to the beginning of the 21st century and achieved widespread fame similar to that of the Harlem Globetrotters. Feigner's meticulous records claim 9,743 victories, 141,517 strikeouts, 930 no-hitters and 238 perfect games. The Washington Post described him as \\"the greatest softball pitcher who ever lived.\\" Despite his substantial record, Feigner said that while his team was known for taking on local softball teams and often winning by considerable margins, the intent of the King and His Court was to entertain audiences, never to embarrass opposing players. \\"When a man steps up to the plate, we have nothing but respect for him,\\" he was noted for oft quoting. \\"The King and His Court\\" was a four-man team: pitcher, catcher, first baseman, and shortstop. When asked why the team had four members, Feigner answered he had been told no team could take on his pitching so he should reduce the roster to simply himself. Feigner accepted the dare and originally wanted a two-man team of himself and catcher, but increased it to three in case an opposing player got a hit. He then added a fourth player when he realized that if all three of his team were on base, no one would be up to bat. In honor of his time in the Marine Corps, the King and His Court often played against military personnel, often at venues such as Army bases or the decks of aircraft carriers. They had also been known for donating considerable amounts of ticket profits to charity, and following Operation Desert Storm, had put veteran support as the chief charity they played for. On February 18, 1967, Feigner appeared in a celebrity charity softball game against many Major League Baseball players. In the game Feigner struck out Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Brooks Robinson, Roberto Clemente, Maury Wills, and Harmon Killebrew all in a row. Feigner also struck out Alan Chambers three times in a 1976 exhibition game.http://www.union- bulletin.com/local_columnists/etcetera/big-eddie-feigner-fan-discovers-game- program-in-a-box/article_3d19808c-76e7-11e7-b81f-73bcee7f73a8.html Feigner retired from pitching after suffering a stroke in 2000 but continued to tour with his team, acting as emcee and telling stories while the team played. The team was satirized on a 2006 episode of the Fox sitcom King of the Hill entitled \\"You Gotta Believe (In Moderation)\\" by a team called The Ace of Diamonds and His Jewels. Feigner died in February 2007 in Huntsville, Alabama. He is buried in the Huntsville Memory Gardens Cemetery.Eddie Feigner Feigner was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2013.\\"Shrine of the Eternals ‚Äì Inductees\\".

In terms of the Euro-American tradition, the main periods are captured in the bipartite division, Modernist literature and Postmodern literature, flowering from roughly 1900 to 1940 and 1960 to 1990Lewis, Barry. \\"Postmodernism and Literature.\\" The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism NY: Routledge, 2002, p. 121. respectively, divided, as a rule of thumb, by World War II. The somewhat malleable term of contemporary literature is usually applied with a post-1960 cut off point. Although these terms (modern, contemporary and postmodern) are most applicable to Western literary history, the rise of the globalization has allowed European literary ideas to spread into non-Western cultures fairly rapidly, so that Asian and African literatures can be included into these divisions with only minor qualifications. And in some ways, such as in Postcolonial literature, writers from non-Western cultures were on the forefront of literary development. Technological advances during the 20th century allowed cheaper production of books, resulting in a significant rise in production of popular literature and trivial literature, comparable to the similar developments in music. The division of \\"popular literature\\" and \\"high literature\\" in the 20th century is by no means absolute, and various genres such as detectives or science fiction fluctuate between the two. Largely ignored by mainstream literary criticism for the most of the century, these genres developed their own establishments and critical awards; these include the Nebula Award (since 1965), the British Fantasy Award (since 1971) or the Mythopoeic Awards (since 1971). Towards the end of the 20th century, electronic literature developed due to the development of hypertext and later the world wide web. The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded annually throughout the century (with the exception of 1914, 1918, 1935 and 1940‚Äì1943), the first laureate (1901) being Sully Prudhomme. The New York Times Best Seller list has been published since 1942. The best-selling literary works of the 20th century are estimated to be The Lord of the Rings (1954/55, 150 million copies), Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince, 1943, 140 million copies), Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997, 120 million copies) and And Then There Were None (1939, 115 million copies). The Lord of the Rings was also voted \\"book of the century\\" in various surveys. Perry Rhodan (1961 to present) proclaimed as the best-selling book series, with an estimated total of 1 billion copies sold. 1901‚Äì18 The Fin de si√®cle movement of the Belle √âpoque persisted into the 20th century, but was brutally cut short with the outbreak of World War I (an effect depicted e.g. in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, published 1924). The Dada movement of 1916-1920 was at least in part a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war; the movement heralded the Surrealism movement of the 1920s. 1900 * Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad (Poland, England) * The Knights of the Cross by Henryk Sienkiewicz (Poland) Genre fiction * The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L.

It is located on San Diego Bay in southwestern San Diego County, California. In addition to port activities, the Port District controls San Diego Bay and owns and manages the Bay's immediate waterfront under the state's Tidelands Trust. The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics has ranked the Port of San Diego as one of America's top 30 U.S. containership ports bringing in nearly of cargo per year through the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal and the National City Marine Terminal. Together with the National City Marine Terminal, the Port of San Diego is the primary port of entry for Honda, Fiat, Audi, Mazda, Acura, Isuzu, Volkswagen, Nissan, Mitsubishi Fuso, and Hino Motors into America. The Port holds a 24 1/2-year lease with Dole Food Company bringing in much of the country's banana crop. It is also the third-busiest cruise ship port in California. The Port is governed by a seven-member Board of Port Commissioners. One commissioner each is appointed by the city councils of Chula Vista, Coronado, Imperial Beach and National City, and three commissioners are appointed by the San Diego City Council. The Board establishes policies under which the Port's staff ‚Äì supervised by the Executive Director ‚Äì conducts its daily operation. History The San Diego Unified Port District was created in 1962 after the California State legislature passed Senate Bill 41 and the San Diego County Board of Supervisors certified it. In 1964, voters approved a $10.9 million bond for capital improvements. Improvements included the development of a new air terminal, preparation for Harbor Island to be leased, and construction of a new cargo terminal in National City. In 1970, the first cruise ship to offer scheduled cruises out of San Diego since the creation of the Port began making 10-day trips to Mexico. In 1980, the Port completed a wildlife refuge in Chula Vista in an effort to improve the ecological balance of the Bay. In 1983, the San Diego Cruise Industry Consortium was formed to promote San Diego as a cruise destination and homeport. Three years later, the B Street Pier Cruise Ship Terminal was officially dedicated. That year, over 26,000 passengers embarked and disembarked at the terminal. In 1989, the Port-funded, $165 million, waterfront San Diego Convention Center opened. In 1990, The Pasha Group began importing vehicles (Isuzus) at the National City Marine Terminal. A total of 15,589 vehicle units were imported the first year. Pasha now imports over 400,000 vehicles annually. In 1993, the Port and Tenth Avenue Cold Storage Company celebrated the grand opening of San Diego's first on-dock cold storage facility, built for $11 million, at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal. In 2001, the Board of Port Commissioners announced a 20-year lease with Dole Food Company. This signified the Port's entry into the refrigerated containerized cargo market. Dole ships 1.8 billion pounds of bananas annually.40 Fact reflecting 40 Years of Service at portofsandiego.org In 2012, the Port signed a new lease with Dole Food Company for an additional 24 1/2 years. Maritime Port of San Diego Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal The Port of San Diego administers two marine cargo facilities, Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal and National City Marine Terminal. The Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal is a multi-purpose eight berth facility. Inbound cargo includes refrigerated commodities, fertilizer, cement, break bulk commodities, and forest products. The terminal features an on-dock state-of-the-art square foot cold storage facility warehousing a variety of fresh produce and other perishables. The National City Marine Terminal is a seven berth facility operated by The Pasha Group, which processed over 450,000 vehicles during fiscal year 2016. The National City Marine Terminal serves as the primary port of entry for Honda, Acura, Isuzu, Volkswagen, Nissan, Mitsubishi Fuso, and Hino Motors.Maritime Fact Sheet at portofsandiego.orgSan Diego Unified Port District Annual Report 2007 Cruise Port of San Diego B-Street Cruise Terminal The Port's main cruise facility is located downtown. The main facility, at B Street Pier in downtown San Diego, along North Harbor Drive, has three cruise berths. The Port also redeveloped the historic Broadway Pier to create a second cruise- ship pier and terminal, which opened in December 2010. As of 2019, San Diego is the third-busiest cruise port in California. Three cruise lines home-port in San Diego: Holland America, Celebrity Cruises, and Disney Cruise Line. Holland America uses San Diego as a home port during the winter season. Disney and Carnival Cruise Lines have seasonal Mexican cruises in the spring and fall, as well as a Panama Canal cruise at the end of the visit. Multiple other cruise lines use San Diego as a port of call. The Port of San Diego experienced a 44-percent growth in cruise calls between 2002 and 2006, growing from 122 to 219 calls. Passenger numbers more than doubled in that time, from 276,000 in 2002 to 619,000 in 2006.San Diego Unified Port District Annual Report 2006 Cruise ship business peaked in 2008, when the Port hosted 252 ship calls and more than 800,000 passengers. By 2011, the number of ship calls had fallen to 103, a decline blamed on the slumping economy as well as fear of travel to Mexico due to well-publicized violence there. The Mexican government worked to improve the Mexican Riviera destination as well as public safety, driving a return of consumer demand. In 2016, the Port of San Diego's cruise business began an expected rebound, largely driven by growth in business for Holland America Cruise Line and Disney Cruise Lines. The number of ship calls grew from 68 in the 2014-2015 season to 102 in the 2015-2016 season. In 2019-2020 the Port expects approximately 92 cruise calls and nearly 300,000 passengers. Newsworthy events In November 2010 a crippled cruise ship, Carnival Splendor, was towed to the San Diego cruise ship port after drifting for four days without power or electricity following an engine room fire. In May 2013, Celebrity Cruises' Solstice became the longest cruise ship to date to dock in San Diego, during a Wine Country Coastal Cruise. Ships sometimes make unscheduled stops in San Diego because of storm warnings along the Mexico cruise route. During one such diverted call in 2018, San Diego hosted the largest cruise ship ever to dock in San Diego, the 4,500-passenger Norwegian Bliss. The largest ships that normally call in San Diego hold 3,000 passengers. Environment Environmental stewardship is a key role the Port of San Diego plays. The Port engages in public education for both adults and school children regarding pollution prevention. The Port protects San Diego bay through stormwater management and endangered species management. In addition, the bay is protected and improved through removal of hazardous waste and contaminated sediments. Real estate Real estate is one of five strategic activity areas of the Port of San Diego. The Port currently administers approximately 800 separate business agreements. Revenue from real estate assets and developments, primarily building and ground rents and concession fees, was approximately $96 million in FY 2014-2015. The Port of San Diego collects rents from many hotels, restaurants, parking facilities, yacht clubs, etc. around San Diego Bay. Hotels San Diego Bay is home to many large-scale luxury hotels. The Port of San Diego is the landlord for 17 hotels, including the 40-story Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel and the 25-story San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina. An 18th hotel, the San Diego Intercontinental, began construction in June 2016 on the downtown waterfront and opened in September 2018, bringing the InterContinental brand back to the San Diego market after a 30-year absence. The Port also hosts hotels in Point Loma, Harbor Island, and Shelter Island. Shipyards There are currently three shipyards on San Diego Bay, National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), Continental Maritime of San Diego (Huntington Ingalls), and Southwest Marine (BAE Systems). NASSCO is the largest new-construction shipyard on the west coast of the United States; \\"specializing in auxiliary and support ships for the U.S. Navy and oil tankers and dry cargo carriers for commercial markets.\\" Harbor Police The San Diego Harbor Police Department is the law enforcement authority for the Port of San Diego. Harbor Police is the premier police presence in the San Diego Bay, the San Diego International Airport and on all Port Tidelands. Harbor Police jurisdiction extends through the Port's five member cities: Chula Vista, Coronado, Imperial Beach, National City and San Diego. The Harbor Police Department is responsible for Public Safety and Homeland Security on land, sea and in the air. It provides the highest level of security to the entire Port Tidelands and plays an integral role in homeland security. Every sworn Harbor Police Officer is outfitted with a Patrol Rifle, Firefighting and HAZMAT Protective Equipment. Officers are fully sworn Peace Officers in the State of California and Certified Marine Firefighters. The Harbor Police utilizes specialized units to provide high- level security operations which includes; ‚Ä¢ Dive Rescue Team - the premier Police Dive Unit serving the San Diego Region for; Underwater Investigations, Rescue, Underwater Hazardous Device Detection, Body Recovery and bring a complement of advanced underwater technology not typically found on a Public Safety Dive Team such as specialized sonar and robotic technology. ‚Ä¢ Explosive K-9 Unit - these highly trained Dog Handlers and their Canine Partners are the primary response for explosive detection at the San Diego International Airport and serve the San Diego Region for Mutual Aid. ‚Ä¢ Task-Force Officers - Harbor Police Officers may also be assigned to regional special task forces such as the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, Narcotics Task Forces and Maritime Task Forces.

The film stars Richard Widmark as a United States Air Force Air Police Master Sergeant motivated by love and compassion to begin a life of crime. It was based on the 1953 novel by Max Catto. Plot Master Sergeant Joe Lawrence (Richard Widmark) is stationed in Berlin shortly after the end of World War II. He encounters a group of German orphans when one of them tries to steal his Jeep. Joe finds Maria (Mai Zetterling), one of the orphans' caretakers, very attractive. Maria is trying to take the children to Brazil, where they can start life anew. It is being arranged by her employer, Hans Fischer, a very successful German contractor. Hans tells Joe not to return. After thinking it over, Joe disregards him and soon falls in love with Maria. Maria breaks up with Joe, but Joe persists. When he sees Maria returning home and reluctantly submitting to her boss's kisses, he fights with Hans, ending Hans's assistance with the travel arrangements. His buddy, British Corps of Military Police Sergeant Roger Morris (George Cole), has hinted about stealing part of a fortune in recently discovered gold bullion being transferred to England via military transport in a series of four shipments. Joe plans a daring hijacking of the airplane, aided greatly by the fact that he works for the Air Provost Marshal, who shares the security responsibility for the shipments with the British. Roger's uncle Dan puts them in touch with Alfie Stratton, a semi-retired crook who can dispose of the gold. Alfie insists that they use ex-RAF pilot Brian Hammell (Nigel Patrick), to protect his interests. The plan works up to a point. They hijack the C-47 and land at an abandoned airstrip in England. However, the crew manage to retake control of the airplane after only part of the bullion has been unloaded, and try to take off, only to crash into Alfie's car (used to light the runway) and burn. After the gang leave, the crewmen manage to get out unobserved. Thinking they have killed three men, Joe decides to return the gold and turn himself in. Roger and Dan agree. Alfie is regretting getting back into a life of crime, so Joe has no trouble letting him out, in exchange for ¬£5000 to be given to Dan. Brian, who shot at the escaping aircraft and has no qualms against murder, is the only obstacle. Alfie and Dan leave. When Brian wakes up, he does not like the new arrangement. In the ensuing fight, Roger falls to his death and Joe is knocked out. Joe comes to and chases Brian. In his desperation to get away (with a few gold bars), Brian ends up clinging to the edge of a rising drawbridge, finally losing his grip and plummeting into the water far below. When Joe is brought back to Berlin for his court-martial, he sees Maria and the orphans leaving for Brazil.

He also won a silver medal at the 1979 world championships and was a member of the 1980 Olympic team that boycotted the Moscow Olympics. Wrestling career=High School Weaver, who began wrestling at the age of six, won three Pennsylvania state high school titles while competing for Easton Area High School in Easton, Pennsylvania. He won in 1975 and 1976 at the 98-pound weight class and in 1977 at the 105-pound weight class. In 1977 Weaver participated in the Dapper Dan Classic, which features the Pennsylvania all-stars against a national team, and won by a fall in 0:50. He graduated from Easton in 1977 and spent a post-graduate year at Blair Academy, in Blairstown, New Jersey. At Blair he won the National Prep School Championship and the Outstanding Wrestler trophy. College Weaver matriculated at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the fall of 1978. Competing in college was a challenge for Weaver since the lightest NCAA weight class was 118 pounds, well above his freestyle weight class of 105.5 pounds. He red shirted as a freshman at Lehigh and saw little action the following season. However, the next three seasons was a starter for Lehigh at 118 pounds. He won conference titles in 1982 and 1983 and finished third in the 1982 NCAA Division I tournament. He finished his career at Lehigh with a record of 57-14-3 with 16 falls. Freestyle Weaver began competing in freestyle while still in high school. He caused a sensation at the 1976 Olympic trials when he pinned his first eight opponents. He eventually ended up as the alternate on the Olympic team. Then just two years out of high school, Weaver finished second at the 1979 world championships in San Diego, California. Prior to his triumph in Los Angeles, Weaver had won six national freestyle championships, two FILA World Cup gold medals, two World Cup silver medals, gold medals in tournaments in Germany, Poland and Cuba and a silver medal at the demand freestyle tournament in Tbilisi. Weaver was a flamboyant winner, especially when he won by pin. He was known to jump up and down and do somersaults in the air, particularly when he pinned 1976 Olympian William Rosado for the 1980 team berth and when he pinned Takashi Irie in the 1984 48 kg Olympic finals. Following his win in 1984, he circled the arena several times with his young son, Bobby Jr., in his arms. Weaver was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008. He missed the ceremonies because of a serious illness, but was able to attend the following year. Bibliography * Diehl, Denny. 1997. _Mat Power: Lehigh Wrestling Highlights_.

It is said that this family came to Britain with William the Conqueror in the person of Walter, Count de Longueville. However, Barrow states the family were dependents of de Varenne (or de Warenne) and simply came from Longueville-la-Gifart in Seine Maritime. The East Lothian village of Gifford and a nearby stream, Gifford Water, both take their names from this family. Two of this family appeared in Scotland in the train of Ada de Warenne, daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (she married in 1139 Anderson, Alan O., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers AD500 - 1286, London, 1908: 215. Prince Henry (d.1152) son of David I of Scotland (d.1153): Hugh (1) and William, a cleric, who became \\"ecclesiastical advisor\\" to King David I. Hugh (whom Martine calls \\"an Englishman\\") obtained lands in East Lothian, where he settled. William perambulated with King David in Perthshire and was a witness on many important charters, notably the foundation charter of Jedburgh Abbey and others for Countess Ada. He and Hugh witnessed a charter of King David granting lands at Crail. From Malcolm IV of Scotland he obtained lands at Yester (Jhestrith) in the parish of St. Bothans, East Lothian.,Harvey, Charles C.H., & MacLeod, John, editors,Calendar of Writs preserved at Yester House 1166‚Äì1625, Scottish Record Society, Edinburgh, 1930, p.1, no.1, see charter dated between 1166‚Äì1171 by William The Lion who states that Hugh held these lands \\"by grant from my brother King Malcolm and Ada the Countess, my mother\\". Hugh appears in further royal charters till after 1189, and appears to have witnessed many of the charters of King William the Lion (ruled 1165‚Äì1214), under whom he rose to distinction. His son and heir was William de Giffard of Yester, who was sent on a mission to England in 1200 and who also witnessed several charters of William, 'The Lion'. In 1244 he was one of the guarantees of a treaty with England,Anderson, Alan O., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers AD500 - 1286, London, 1908: 355. when he must have been a good age. His son, Hugh de Giffard of Yester (2), was one of the Guardians of Alexander III of Scotland and his Queen; and one of the Regents of the Kingdom appointed by the Treaty of Roxburgh dated 20 September 1255. According to the practice of those feudal times, he had his own sheriff. This Hugh de Gifford built a castle, or tower house, at Yester (half a mile south- east of the present-day Yester House) on a promontory between the Hopes Water and a little tributary, the Gamuelston Burn. To the north is one side of a high curtain wall with an offset base. Beneath it a stair descends to the cavern called Bohall or Hobgoblin Hall, (Goblin Ha'), featured in Sir Walter Scott's Marmion, which Gifford was said to have constructed by magic. Walter Bower thus speaks of him in noting his death in 1267: \\"Hugo Giffard dominus de Zester moritur, cujus castrum, vel saltem caveam et dongionem, arte demoniacula antiquae relationes fuerunt fabricatas,\\" (Scotichronicon, Liber X, cap. 21). Anderson states he left three sons: * William de Giffard of Yester * Hugh (3), ancestor of the Giffards of Sheriffhall. * James, who, with Hugh (4), swore fealty to King Edward I of England in 1296. Burke also gives four daughters, (although it is possible they belong to a later generation) of whom: * Euphemia, who married Sir Archibald Macdowall, Knt., of Makerstoun, Roxburghshire. * Johanna, married Sir Robert Maitland of Thirlestane, to whom she conveyed Lethington.

She was married to Fabrizio Colonna (1460‚Äì1520), duke of Paliano with whom she had six children, among which was the poet Vittoria Colonna. She died, a widow, in 1522 on her way home to Rome, coming back from a pilgrimage at Loreto Sanctuary. Biography Little is known about Agnese's childhood, whose mother died in 1472 when she was only two years old.Millington (1865), 'Vittoria Colonna', p. 6. Her father died in 1482, when Agnese was twelve, after which she was entrusted to the care of her paternal uncle, Ottaviano Ubaldini della Carda, along with her elder sisters. She may have been educated by the humanist Vespasianus Bisticci, a former curator of the library of duke Frederick. However, the education received at the court of Urbino and the influence of female family members helped form Agnese's character, who remained in contact throughout their lives. On 20 January 1489, she married Fabrizio Colonna, who was an important member of the Roman baronial lineage. The marriage contract, signed the year before, asked for the payment of a dowry of 12,000 gold florins. This marriage was part of a strategy to consolidate a network of marriage alliances between the families of Montefeltro and Della Rovere, the Sanseverino, Malatesta, Gonzaga and, indeed, the Colonna. Her son Federico died in 1516 and she became a widow three years later with the death of her husband Fabrizio in 1520.

The lead ship in her class, she was named for the Pasig River (the second U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name) which flows through Manila on the Island of Luzon, Philippines. Originally laid down as SS Mission San Xavier, a Maritime Commission T2-SE-A2 tanker (MC hull 1826) by the Marinship Corporation of Sausalito, California on 18 May 1944; renamed USS Pasig (AO‚Äì91) on 3 July 1944; launched on 15 July 1944, sponsored by Mrs. John A. McCone; redesignated USS Pasig (AW‚Äì3) on 28 August 1944; acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Commission on 21 October 1944; and commissioned on 11 December 1944 with Lieutenant Commander Clarke M. Williams in command. Service history=World War II, 1944-1947 Following shakedown off California, Pasig sailed on 3 March 1945 to begin her mission of distilling and supplying fresh water to units of the Allied navies in the western Pacific. She arrived at Ulithi on 23 March and immediately commenced supplying water to landing craft, preparing for the Okinawa campaign, merchant vessels, and various harbor craft. With no natural water supply at Ulithi, Pasig refilled periodically from tankers from the Philippines, or made trips to the closest natural source. On 7 May she departed for a water run to Manus, whence, redirected, she steamed northeast to Eniwetok. There she joined ServDiv 102 and continued to supply Pacific Fleet units, and bases ashore, with fresh water until ordered back to the United States for inactivation in late 1946. Decommissioned in February 1947, she was berthed at San Diego, California until war again broke out in the Far East. Korean War, 1951-1955 Recommissioned on 15 March 1951 Pasig reported to MSTS WestPac at Yokosuka in April. For 37 continuous months her 120,000 gallon/day distilling plant provided fresh water, for human and machine consumption, to units of the United Nations forces operating in Korean and Japanese waters. In 1954 she was again designated for inactivation and, in May, she departed Yokosuka for the West Coast. Decommissioning Decommissioned for the last time on 15 June 1955, she entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, where she remained until transferred to the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington in June 1960. On 1 July 1960 Pasig's name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Final Disposition, sold for scrapping, 16 October 1975, to Levin Metals Corp.

He began his collegiate career at Georgia Tech before transferring to the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs. He majored in International Affairs at Georgia Tech. He later enrolled as a graduate student majoring in Information Systems Security at Louisiana Tech in the fall of 2008. Football career=High school Taylor Bennett attended Lafayette High School in Wildwood, Missouri from 2000 to 2004. College Bennett was selected as the Yellow Jackets' backup quarterback before the 2004 game against the Maryland Terrapins. Prior to the 2007 season, he started in two games; in 2005 against the Connecticut Huskies when Reggie Ball had viral meningitis, and in the 2007 Gator Bowl against the West Virginia Mountaineers when Reggie Ball was academically ineligible to play. At the Connecticut game, Bennett became only the second quarterback in NCAA history to complete a pass for a touchdown in his first ever collegiate play from scrimmage. The only other quarterback to do this was former Southern California quarterback Matt Leinart. In May 2007, Bennett was given a Spring Team honorable mention by The Sporting News in recognition of his outstanding performance in spring practice. Bennett had a mediocre showing in Georgia Tech's 2007 season, finishing 7-6, 4-4 ACC, including a loss to Fresno State. After the 2007 season, Paul Johnson was named as Georgia Tech's new head coach. Many believed that Bennett would not fit well into Johnson's option offense, and in February 2008 Bennett announced that he planned to transfer to another school for the 2008 season. On April 28, it was announced that Bennett would transfer to Louisiana Tech, and the NCAA would allow him to play in the 2008 season rather than sitting out a season as most transfers are required to do. Bennett won the starting job for the Bulldogs during 2008 fall camp. He led his new team to a victory over the Mississippi State Bulldogs of the Southeastern Conference in the 2008 season opener. Unfortunately, this proved to be the highlight of Bennett's season with the Bulldogs. Over the first five games of the season Bennett completed only 39 percent of his passes. He threw 2 touchdowns and 5 interceptions and led the team to a 2-3 record. After a disappointing loss to Hawaii, in which Bennett threw 2 interceptions, head coach Derek Dooley announced that sophomore Ross Jenkins would start the next game against Idaho. Bennett saw little action for the rest of the season. He went 5 for 11 in only 2 games for no touchdowns and 1 interception. Sweden During the 2009 season Bennett was the starting quarterback for the Stockholm Mean Machines in Stockholm, Sweden. A season that ended with the club's 11th national championship. Bennett finished his season in the EFL playing for the Stockholm Mean Machine with a 6-2 record although the team finished 14-3. The team went on to win the national championship, thus qualifying for the Euro-Championship tournament. Taylor finished the season with 1756 yards passing, 26 touchdowns, and just 1 interception. Political career A member of the Democratic Party, Bennett ran in a special election to replace Republican Mike Jacobs for the right to represent District 80 in the Georgia House of Representatives. He won a runoff election against former Brookhaven, Georgia mayor J. Max Davis on August 11, 2015 to capture the seat. In 2016, Bennett was defeated for reelection by Atlanta attorney Meagan Hanson.http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt-- politics/hanson-defeats-bennett-for-brookhaven-area-house- seat/D22bXSMD1yWnWRcFG4bFzL/ See also * List of Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets starting quarterbacks * 2006 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team * 2007 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team * 2008 Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football team ReferencesExternal links * Georgia Tech profile Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Democrats Category:Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football players Category:Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football players Category:People from St. Louis County, Missouri Category:Players of American football from Missouri Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis ","title":"Taylor Bennett"},{"id":"10057294","text":"The metropolitan area surrounding and including Detroit, Michigan, is a ten- county area with a population of over 5.9 million, a workforce of 2.6 million, and about 347,000 businesses.Regional Profile .

Historic highlights B-24s under construction at Ford's Willow Run line President Franklin Roosevelt referred to America as the \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\". Detroit and its automotive industries played a pivotal role in the Allied victory during World War II. With Europe, Asia, and the Pacific islands under siege by the Axis powers, Henry Ford's genius would be turned to mass production for the war effort. Specifically, the B-24 Liberator bomber, still the most produced allied heavy bomber in history, quickly shifted the balance of power. The aviation industry could produce, if everything went all right, one Consolidated Aircraft B-24 Bomber a day at an aircraft plant. Ford would show the world how to produce one B-24 an hour, and at peak production Ford produced 650 per month at Willow Run by 1944. Ford's Willow Run factory broke ground in the April 1941. At the time, it was the largest assembly plant in the world, with over . Edsel Ford, Henry Ford's son, under stress, died in the Spring of 1943 of stomach cancer prompting Henry Ford to resume day-to-day control of the Ford Motor Company. Willow Run completed its first B-24 in October 1942, with production increasing substantially by August 1943. Pilots and crew slept on the 1,300 cots waiting to fly the B-24s as they rolled off the assembly line at Ford's Willow Run facility.Nolan, Jenny (January 28, 1997).Willow Run and the Arsenal of Democracy .

Biography=Early life Hilda Beatrice Hewlett was born in Vauxhall, London on 17 February 1864 to Louisa Herbert n√©e Hopgood and George William Herbert, a Church of England vicar.1891 Census of Lambeth, RG11/599, Folio 25, Page 1, Hilda Beatrice Herbert, Parsonage, Lambeth (Father George William Herbert is described as Vicar of St Peters) Hilda was one of nine siblings.Pat Irene Winton. 'Hewlett, Hilda Beatrice - Biography', from the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 1-Sep-10 As a young woman she attended the National Art Training School in South Kensington. She specialised in three skills which served her well in her later aviation engineering career: woodwork, metalwork, and needlework. Her art was good enough to be exhibited. When she was 19 she visited Egypt with her parents. At the age of 21 she spent a year training as a nurse at a hospital in Berlin. She was an early bicycle and motor car enthusiast and participated in automobile rallies. She married Maurice Henry Hewlett on 3 January 1888 in St Peter's Church, Vauxhall, where her father was the incumbent. The couple had two children, a daughter, Pia, and a son, Francis, but separated in 1914. Maurice Hewlett was unsympathetic to his wife's involvement in aviation and claimed, \\"Women will never be as successful in aviation as men. They have not the right kind of nerve.\\" The Elmbridge Hundred, 2009, 2010 ‚Äì Article on Hilda Hewlett by Anne Wright. accessed 9 Jan 2012. Achievements in aviation Hewlett attended her first aviation meeting at Blackpool in 1909. Later that year, after adopting the pseudonym \\"Grace Bird\\", she travelled to the airfield at Mourmelon-le-Grand, France, to study aeronautics. She met aviation engineer Gustav Blondeau and they became business partners. Hewlett returned to England with a Farman III biplane, nicknamed the Blue Bird. In the summer of 1910 she and Blondeau opened the first flying school in the United Kingdom at the Brooklands motor-racing circuit at Weybridge, Surrey. Many people gained their first experience of flying at Hewlett and Blondeau's school, including Thomas Sopwith. Thirteen pupils graduated from the school in the year and a half it operated and, with a remarkable safety record for the time, there were no accidents. On 29 August 1911, at Brooklands, Hilda Hewlett became the first woman in the UK to earn a pilot's licence when she received certificate No.122 from the Royal Aero Club after completing the test in her biplane. Hewlett also taught her son, Francis, to fly; he earned pilot's certificate no. 156 on 14 November 1911 and went on to have a distinguished military aviation career in both the UKHe took part in the Cuxhaven Raid, during which he had to ditch his aircraft, a Short Type 135, due to engine failure. He was rescued by a Dutch fishing vessel, which took him to the Dutch port of Ymunden, where he arrived on 2 January 1915; from there he was able to make his way back to England. and New Zealand, making him the first military pilot taught to fly by his mother. He earned a Distinguished Service Order in 1915 and rose to the rank of group captain. Hilda Hewlett participated in airshows and aviation competitions. On 11 September 1911 she flew her Farman biplane in an airshow at Chelson Meadow, Plymouth. In 1912 Hewlett won a quick-start aviation competition. Hewlett and Blondeau started an aircraft manufacturing business, Hewlett & Blondeau Limited, which was managed by Hewlett. They built Farman, Caudron and Hanriot aircraft under licence. The business began at Brooklands, moved to Battersea, London, and finally settled on a site at Leagrave, Bedfordshire, in May 1914. By August 1914 the company had produced 10 different types of aircraft. During the First World War, Hewlett's company manufactured more than 800 military aircraft, a specialised engine which the British government considered vital to the war effort, and employed up to 700 people. After the war the business diversified into making farming equipment, but the factory had closed by the end of October 1920. The site remained unsold until 1926.Hewlett and Blondeau history A road in Luton, Hewlett Road, was named after her in recognition of the importance of the company towards the war effort. Emigration to New Zealand Hewlett had previously spent nine months touring New Zealand, Rarotonga (Cook Islands), and the United States, but it was not until the factory site was sold that she emigrated to Tauranga, New Zealand, with her daughter Pia Richards and Pia's family. Hilda stated, \\"The urge to escape from the three Cs, crowds, convention, and civilization, became strong.\\" She enjoyed the outdoor life, especially camping and fishing. Her family gave her the nickname \\"Old Bird\\". In June 1932 Hewlett was present at the inaugural meeting of the Tauranga Aero and Gliding Club. In July she was elected as the club's first president. In January 1939, at the opening of a new aerodrome in Tauranga, Frederick Jones, New Zealand's then Minister of Defence, named a nearby road after Hilda Hewlett and her son Francis, in recognition of their services to aviation. Death and afterwards Hewlett died on 21 August 1943 in Tauranga, North Island, New Zealand. Following a service on the railway wharf, she was buried at sea. Her grandson's wife Gail has carried out exhaustive research into the lives of both Hilda and Maurice Hewlett and recently published the results of this work;Hewlett, Gail (2010) 'Old Bird ‚Äì The Irrepressible Mrs Hewlett' (Troubadour Publishing Ltd, Leicester, ) the book was officially launched on 26 April 2010 at St Peter's Church in Vauxhall, London.

It broadcasts a Regional Mexican format. History The station signed on December 7, 1946 as WGAY, airing a beautiful music format. It was believed that WGAY was named for one-time owner, Connie B. Gay, though it was merely coincidental; at the time, \\"beautiful music\\" connoted a \\"bright and gay\\" happy sound. However, Gay bought the station in the late 1950s/early 1960s. It was later purported that the station initially broadcast government job openings, and that WGAY stood for \\"Government And You.https://earlyradiohistory.us/hist-dc.htm - This came from an e-mail that stated, at a field trip to the station: \\"...[the e-mailer was] told that the station started out broadcasting gov't. job openings, and that the call letters meant: 'Government And You.'\\"\\" The original owners and operators, Ed Winton and Bob Chandler, are credited with creating the beautiful music format, which was mostly instrumental music, with orchestral covers of showtunes, soundtrack excerpts, and standard popular songs. Chandler was known to arrange for recording of music that he did not have in the station's library. In addition, on Sunday afternoons at 1:00 p.m., Matinee at One played a complete Broadway show soundtrack with an explanation of the plot. Despite its sobriquet of \\"elevator music\\", WGAY was popular, and was soon sold to Connie B. Gay. On February 1, 1960, the WGAY calls were moved to the FM band at 99.5 MHz, while the AM station became WQMR, for \\"Washington's Quality Music Radio.\\" WGAY initially operated as an experimental country music station (Gay was a country and western music promoter) but started simulcasting WQMR full- time around 1961. These simulcasts would usually end nightly at sunset when WQMR had to sign off as required by the FCC, and WGAY was rarely mentioned on the air or in advertisements. WQMR soon increased in power from 1000 watts on the AM band, while WGAY would upgrade from 20 kW to a 50 kW stereo signal. Both WQMR and WGAY moved to the World Building, located on Georgia Avenue, just north of the intersection of Maryland Route 410 (East-West-Highway) in Silver Spring, in 1966. This simulcast arrangement continued well into the 1980s, as WQMR reverted to WGAY. Winton and Chandler sold the station on September 1, 1984 to Greater Media, which in turn ended the simulcast and changed the call letters to WNTR. (The WGAY calls and format afterward were maintained on the FM band on 99.5 MHz, which is now WIHT.) Greater Media subsequently bought WRC (now WTEM) from NBC Radio and sold WNTR to TM Productions. Later, WNTR was sold to Pat Robertson, the televangelist and founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, who used WNTR as the anchor of a conservative talk radio network dubbed \\"The News Talk Radio Network\\". WNTR was also the first station to carry Rush Limbaugh in Washington, before he moved to WMAL (now WSBN; Limbaugh now airs on WMAL-FM). This ended when the World Building studios caught on fire.The Washington Post, February 2, 2007 However, Robertson's company continued to run the station from another building in Silver Spring for a time, initially as part of his network and later in a brokered-program format. In the early 1990s, it became one of two Washington, DC area affiliates of the Radio Aahs network for children. (The WNTR call letters are now in use by an FM station in Indianapolis.) As Radio Aahs, the station's call letters became WKDL (in a simulcast with WKDV in Manassas, Virginia). The concept was not successful at the time, and Metro Radio then bought the station, and switched WKDL to a Spanish language format. When that did not succeed, it briefly carried first the Genesis Radio Network of conservative talk, and then a business radio format under the WPLC callsign. Bonneville International then bought the station in 2004, at which point the station became WFED, carrying \\"Federal News Radio\\", a news/talk format oriented to government employees that Bonneville had launched as an Internet-only station on February 22, 2000. Initially, WFED aired the Associated Press' All News Radio service during the overnight hours, as a complement to Bonneville's main all-news station, WTOP. When AP All News Radio was terminated, the station began an affiliation with CNN Headline News, which itself was phased out in 2007 by provider Westwood One. In November 2007, the 1050 frequency increased its daytime power from 1 kW to 3.5 kW in order to better reach the government office workers in Washington, D.C. who comprise Federal News Radio's core audience. The station's logo as \\"Air America Washington\\" reflected WZAA's operation by Air America. In August 2008, WFED was moved to 1500 AM, following the discontinuation of that frequency's previous occupant, WWWT. This move significantly improved WFED's daytime and nighttime coverage. While the 1500 facility is a 50,000-watt clear channel station, 1050 must power down to 44 watts at night, effectively limiting its nighttime coverage to Prince George's County. After a month-long transition period, 1050 was switched to a simulcast of WTOP-FM, under the WTOP call letters. From June 17, 2009 until January 25, 2010, the station aired a news, talk and information format, mostly provided by Air America, which leased the station from Bonneville; the call letters were then changed to WZAA.launches tonight Air America announced its closure and ended live programming on January 21, 2010, and went off-the-air on January 25; as a result, WZAA reverted to the WTOP-FM simulcast, and changed its call letters back to WTOP on February 1. That June, the simulcast again ceased, and 1050 was leased out to United Media Group, who launched the current regional Mexican format and WBQH callsign. Bonneville announced the sale of WBQH, as well as 16 other stations, to Hubbard Broadcasting on January 19, 2011. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011. Translator In addition to the main station, WBQH is relayed by one FM translator to widen its broadcast area.

Hydrobiologia, 595(1), 365-377 Species are semivoltine, meaning their lifecycles last 1 to 2 years. Adults of the family usually emerge in late spring or early summer, April through June. Larvae are flattened and brown in color, and they are roach-like in appearance because of the expanded thoracic plates covering the bases of their legs, heads, and abdomens. Tapering gills occur on the thorax at the bases of the legs. These tracheal gills are multifunctional and key to many biological processes. No dense tufts or branching gills are found on their thoraces or abdomens, unlike other Plecoptera families. The larvae also possess broad, chisel-like mandibles. Adults have two ocelli in addition to its two compound eyes. Male epiprocts are sclerotized and rod-like in shape, and both genders lack cross-veins in the anal lobe of the forewings.Stark, Bill P, & Stewart, Kenneth W (1981). The Nearctic Genera of Pertoperlidae (Plecoptera). Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. Vol 54: 285-311. Peltoperlidae are generally lotic erosional and depositional. These habitats are flowing streams marked by sediments, vascular plants, and detritus. Roach- like stoneflies are generally found in leaf litter and debris piles trapped in either riffles or pools. This family is considered to be clingers-sprawlers; they attach to surface in erosional habitats or rest loosely on the top surfaces of substrates, respectively. The body of this stonefly is flattened and streamlined to aid in minimizing water resistance in a flowing stream. The Peltoperlidae are classified as in the feeding group shredders-detritivores. They chew and mine through leaf litter in their habitats. They are a significant contributor to leaf breakdown in streams. This family is very sensitive to disturbances in environmental conditions. They are intolerant to loss of coarse particulate organic matter for food and habitat. Given this low tolerance, Peltoperlids make potential bioindicators.Qin, Chun-Yan et al (2014).

Following the war, Mackensen stood trial for war crimes before a British military tribunal in Italy where he was convicted and sentenced to death, however the sentence was later commuted and Mackensen was released in 1952, and died in West Germany in 1969. Early life Eberhard was born on 24 September 1889, in Bromberg, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, the fourth of five children to Field Marshal August von Mackensen and his wife Dorothea (n√©e von Horn). Mackensen joined the Imperial German Army in 1908, where he became a Fahnenjunker of the XVII Corps stationed in Danzig, and was promoted to lieutenant on 22 March 1910. Military career At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Mackensen served as a regimental adjutant in the 1st Hussar Regiment. On 25 February 1915, he was promoted to first lieutenant, but after a severe wound on 23 August 1915, Mackensen was transferred to a staff job in the General Staff of the Army Group Scholtz. On 20 May 1917, he was promoted to captain. Following the armistice in 1918 ending the war, Mackensen remained in the army (now the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic) where he served as chief of the 1st squadron of the 5th (Prussian) Rider Regiment in Belgard, but in 1919 also joined the Freikorps paramilitary group and fought in the Baltic states.Theo Schwarzm√ºller: Zwischen Kaiser und ‚ÄûF√ºhrer‚Äú Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen. Eine politische Biographie. dtv, M√ºnchen 2001, (181.page) . In 1925, Mackensen commanded the army transport department of the German General Staff of the Ministry of the Reichswehr in Berlin. After his appointment as a major on 1 February, 1928, he served from 1930 in the staff of the 1st Cavalry Division in Frankfurt (Oder), and while serving in this position was promoted on 1 October 1932, to lieutenant colonel From 1 November 1933, Mackensen was made chief of the staff of the General Inspectorate of the Cavalry, and was promoted to colonel on 1 September 1934. Mackensen became chief of staff of the X Army Corps in Hamburg, the successor of the cavalry in the newly-formed Wehrmacht. In 1937, Mackensen became commander of the 1st Cavalry Brigade in Insterburg. Mackensen was appointed major general on 1 January 1938, and on 1 May 1939 became commander in the Army Group Command V in Vienna, where he became chief of staff under Field Marshal Wilhelm List. Mackensen (2nd from right) At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, Mackensen served as the chief of staff of the German 14th Army in the invasion of Poland. Later, he was made chief of staff of the 12th Army and fought in France. On 1 January 1940, he was promoted to lieutenant general and eight months later to General der Kavallerie. On 15 January 1941, Mackensen was made commanding general of III Army Corps under the 1st Panzer Army in Army Group South, and on 27 July 1941, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Mackensen's forces were the first to reach Kiev at the First Battle of Kiev during the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In November 1942, when General Paul Ewald von Kleist was given the command of Army Group A, Mackensen took up leadership of the 1st Panzer Army in the Third Battle of Kharkov in March 1943. For his achievements in the Second Battle of Kharkov, Mackensen was honored on 26 May 1942 with the Oak Leaves added to his Iron Cross award, and promoted to colonel general (Generaloberst) on 6 July 1943. Shortly after his promotion to Generaloberst, Mackensen was transferred to Italy as commander of the 14th Army. After the Allies broke through the Winter Line during Operation Diadem, Kesselring fired Mackensen for disobeying orders and Mackensen retired from active service in the army in the summer of 1944.James Holland, Italy's Sorrow. A Year of War, 1944-1945, London, 2008, Harper Press. Trial and conviction On 24 March 1944, SS members shot and killed 335 Italian civilians in the Ardeatine Caves massacre in retaliation for the deaths of 32 German soldiers in a bomb attack. This war crime was ordered by Adolf Hitler in consultation with Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. Mackensen was at this time commander of the 14th Army and subordinate to Kesselring as well as the superior of Lieutenant-General Kurt M√§lzer, military commandant of Rome. All three were convicted of war crimes. Following the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 Mackensen became a prisoner of war, and on 30 November 1946 was convicted of war crimes by a British military court in Rome, where he was sentenced to death. In mid-1947, his sentence was commuted to 21 years imprisonment. He was released on 2 October 1952 after serving five years. After his release, Mackensen lived a secluded life in Alt M√ºhlendorf (now in Warder in Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde district) near Nortorf in Schleswig-Holstein, West Germany.

Ensign commented: \\"What the Justice Department testified yesterday is inconsistent with what they told me. I can't even tell you how upset I am at the Justice Department.\\" A week later, Ensign said \\"I'm calling on the President of the United States and the attorney general to restore Dan Bogden's reputation....Everyone in Nevada thought Dan had done a superb job....I believe a very good man was wronged and a process was flawed.\\" Allegedly, Bogdan was fired for investigating Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons (R) for bribery.Rood, Justin.

Early life Clifford was born Johanna Crow on August 3, 1851 in Catham, Ontario, Canada of Irish immigrant parents. Her family moved to Detroit, Michigan while she was still a child. Later, still in Detroit, she married a man named Conrad Steinbrecher. Saint Paul Widowed in 1886 at the age of 35, Clifford moved to St. Paul. In 1887 she brought two building lots in Washington Street opposite the city morgue and police station. She had two red brick buildings built. Clifford lived in one, no. 145, and started a brothel in the other, no. 147. Washington Street was then the sin district of St. Paul. This was one of the most up-market brothels in St. Paul, and employed the best girls. The interior of the house was well appointed with plush furnishing and marble fireplaces. The waiting area featured crystal chandeliers and Mumm's champagne was served. Business was good, and in 1895 records show that Clifford employed 11 prostitutes and three servants. A musician was also included in 1900 records. By the 1920s the brothel needed two telephone lines. Clifford was known to accept diamonds in payment from clients, She was reputed to have had several hundred uncut diamonds. Clifford frequently appeared in court, as did other madams, and was fined. The fine was effectively a licensing fee. She also paid regular bribes to the police to stay open. She was arrested in 1913 in connection with the corruption case against former police chief Martin Flanagan and detective Fred Turner. Clifford was charged with bribery but avoided a conviction by testifying for the prosecution. Clifford invested her profits in property in Michigan. She ran the business personally until she died of a stroke on July 14, 1929, aged 78, in Detroit while visiting family, and is buried there in Mount Elliott Cemetery. Legacy The house was demolished in 1937. Journalist and twice mayor of St. Paul, Larry Hodgson, wrote a poem to mark the event: > \\"The Lay of Nina Clifford\\" The windows are grimy and covered with dust > In that old house under the hill > The door hinges rusty, the lock is bust > The spider webs cover it still > No longer do gay lights their welcome convey > Inviting the wayfarer in > To choose from the bevy, his favorite lay > To dally a while and sin > Gone are the sofas and plush covered chairs > From the parlor once happy and bright > No longer do douche pans in bedrooms upstairs > Clank busily all thru the night > No more do fat durghers play and carouse > And some pretty blonds on their backs > For Nina is dead and her once famous house > Is sold to pay up the back tax > They'¬íre widening the street so they¬í're tearing it down > The whorehouse that was once the pride of the town > Soon won¬í't be worth more than a fart > It'¬ís stone they are taking the morgue to repair > A purpose appropriate ¬ñ‚Äì true > For many a stiff has been laid in them both > Even as me and you A brick from the brothel is mounted in the Minnesota Club with a plaque below that reads, \\"This brick from Nina Clifford's house is presented to the Gentlemen of the Minnesota Club for their great interest in historic buildings\\". The club renamed its billiard room after Clifford. The ornate crystal chandelier from the waiting room of the brothel was hung in the St. Paul mayor's office after the brothel was demolished. The foundations of the brothel were discovered during excavations for the Science Museum of Minnesota in 1998. A group of archaeologists from the 106 Group unearthed many artifacts. From these they concluded that, although the prostitutes earned nine or ten times the average women's earnings at the time, conditions were unsanitary and harsh. The infamous tunnel to the Minnesota Club is a persistent legend, but no tunnel was found during the excavations. Clifford was memorialized in the 1980s with a play, and then a musical, about her antics. It was entitled Nina! Madam to a Saintly City.

He was its spiritual leader until he was killed in the 2009 Boko Haram uprisingBoko Haram: The Emerging Jihadist Threat in West Africa ‚Äì Background, Anti-Defamation League, December 12, 2011. The group's official name is Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which in Arabic means \\"People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad\\". Born in Girgir village, in Jakusko, present-day Yobe State, Nigeria, Yusuf received a local education.\\"West African Militancy and Violence\\", page 74 Later he studied more of Islam and became a Salafi. Education and beliefs According to scholar Paul Lubeck of the University of California at Santa Cruz, as a young man Yusuf was instructed in Salafism and was strongly influenced by the teachings of Ibn Taymiyyah. He had the equivalent of a graduate education, according to Nigerian academic Hussain Zakaria. Yusuf was reported as speaking proficient English. He believed in strict application of Islamic law, which represented his ideal of justice according to the teachings of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Boko Haram hitmen would murder members of other Muslim sects like the Salafist Izala and the Sufi Tidjaniyya and Qadiriya fraternities. In a 2009 BBC interview, Yusuf stated his belief that the concept of a spherical Earth is contrary to Islamic teaching and should be rejected. He also rejected Darwinian evolution, and the concept of the condensation cycle that produces rain. In the interview he said: > \\"There are prominent Islamic preachers who have seen and understood that the > present Western-style education is mixed with issues that run contrary to > our beliefs in Islam,\\" he said. \\"Like rain. We believe it is a creation of > God rather than an evaporation caused by the sun that condenses and becomes > rain. \\"Like saying the world is a sphere. If it runs contrary to the > teachings of Allah, we reject it. We also reject the theory of Darwinism.\\"  Personal life  Yusuf had four wives and 12 children, one of them being Abu Musab al-Barnawi, who has claimed since 2016 to be the rightful leader of Boko Haram, opposing Abubakar Shekau. He was reported as living a lavish lifestyle, which included ownership and driving of a Mercedes-Benz. Death Following the July 2009 Boko Haram uprising, the Nigerian military captured Yusuf at his parents-in-law's house. They transferred him to the custody of the Nigerian police force. The police summarily executed Yusuf in public view outside the police headquarters in Maiduguri. Police officials initially claimed either that Yusuf was shot while trying to escape, or died of wounds he sustained during a gun battle with the military.

He was the third son of Pietro II Orseolo and Maria Candiano, whom he succeeded at the age of sixteen, becoming the youngest doge in Venetian history.Hazlitt, 115‚Äì133. Early life When the Emperor Otto III sojourned in Verona and granted many privileges to Venice in the March of Verona, he requested Pietro to send his third son to Verona, where the Emperor acted as his sponsor at his confirmation.Norwich, 50‚Äì51. In the Emperor's honour, he was given the name Otto. In 1004, Pietro Otto, in the company of his eldest son and co-doge Giovanni, traveled to Constantinople, where Giovanni married the niece of Basil II, Maria Argyra, and Otto received several honorific titles.Norwich, 59‚Äì61. After Giovanni's sudden death (1006), Pietro raised Otto to the dogeship with him. He then made a testament, giving the majority of his wealth to the poor and the Church, and retired to a monastery, leaving Otto the government. When Pietro finally died in 1008, he left Otto sole doge at the meager age of sixteen.Norwich, 61. Soon after the death of his father, in 1009, Otto married Grimelda, a daughter of the newly Christian G√©za of Hungary and Adelaide.Staley, 315. Because the Chronicon Venetum of John the Deacon ends in Otto's reign, it is necessary to rely on later chronicles. According to the chronicler (and doge) Andrea Dandolo, writing from a vantage point three centuries ahead, Otto was: Reign and deposition (1008‚Äì26) Scandal marked much of Otto's reign, as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism with the elevation of several relatives to positions of power. In 1017, Vitale Candiano, the Patriarch of Grado, died and Otto appointed his elder brother (Pietro's second son), Orso, already Bishop of Torcello, to the vacant patriarchate.Norwich, 62. Otto then filled the vacant Torcello with his younger brother Vitale. These actions lost him the support of the people, though they did not yet clamour for his removal from office. The denunciations of Poppo of Treffen, the Patriarch of Aquileia, incited the Venetians to expel Otto and the patriarch of Grado from Venice, whence they took refuge in Istria from 1022 to 1023. But in that latter year, Poppo sacked the patriarchal palace and church in Grado and the Venetians recalled Otto and Orso. In 1024, Pope John XIX confirmed Orso's right to hold Grado and confirmed the patriarchal rights of his see vis-√†-vis Aquileia. However, Otto continued to use church appointments to his own personal and familial advantage and the enemies of the Orseoli in Venice, with popular support, moved to depose him in 1026. They arrested him, shaved his beard, and banished him to Constantinople.Norwich, 63. There he was well received by Constantine VIII, the uncle of his sister-in-law, who repealed trade privileges previously granted to the Republic under Pietro II. Not for nothing had Otto built up a good rapport with the emperors of Europe: the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II likewise revoked Venetian trade privileges in response to his deposition. Stephen I of Croatia, at the instigation of Otto's son Pietro, attacked the coastal cities of Dalmatia, capturing several from Venice. Death in exile (1032) Meanwhile, the Venetians had grown sick of Otto's successor, Pietro Barbolano, and they deposed him in turn (1032). Vitale of Torcello went to Constantinople to seek out his brother to reassume the ducal throne, while Orso of Grado took the government in his own hands in the interim. Vitale arrived in the Byzantine capital to find Otto on the verge of death and he died before he could return to Venice. Orso resigned the temporal power as soon as news reached Venice, while a relative, Domenico,Norwich, 63, calls him \\"an obscure offshoot of the family,\\" while McClellan, 39‚Äì43, makes him a younger brother of Otto. tried to usurp the throne. He failed and the Venetians turned to one Domenico Flabanico to be their doge. Otto's son Pietro later succeeded Stephen as King of Hungary. Otto had two daughters, Frozza Orseolo and Felicia Orseolo, who married Nicolo Bembo. Their daughter Elena Bembo married Zuane Michiel, son of Vitale Michiel and Felicia Elena Cornaro, and their son was Domenico Michiel. NotesSources *Hazlitt, W. Carew. (1915).

Overview  The mountain reaches a height of 978 metres and therefore qualifies as a Munro, however it is overshadowed by many higher mountains in the area although it is well seen from the main A82 road in Strath Fillan between Tyndrum and Crianlarich.\\"The Munros\\" Page 20 (From Strathfillan ‚Ä¶ Shows whole of its northern flank). The hills name translates as Mountain of the Black Rock,\\"The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland\\" Page 318 (Give translation as ‚ÄúMountain of the Black Rock‚Äú). this refers to the steep and rocky face on the mountains south west slopes above Loch Oss which offer scrambling routes to the summit.\\"In the Hills of Breadalbane\\" Page 121 Gives meaning of translation.  Geography and Biology  Beinn Dubhchraig stands in a group of mountains which rise around the headwaters of the River Cononish and includes two other Munros (Ben Lui and Ben Oss) and the Corbett Beinn Chuirn. The glen of Cononish and the four mountains make up the Ben Lui National Nature Reserve, an area which attracts many biologists who come to study the profusion of mountain plants which grow on the moist rocky cliffs and outcrops. The soil in the reserve is of low acidity and saxifrages grow in abundance. Large herds of deer can be found in the corries around the mountain.Ben Lui NNR website. Gives info on national nature reserve. The mountain stands in an area that has always been popular for hill walking, even before the advent of the motor car, Tyndrum‚Äôs two railway stations gave easy access to these hills.\\"100 Best Routes on Scottish Mountains\\" Page 28 (Easy access to hill). Beinn Dubhchraig‚Äôs best topographic feature is its northern corrie which forms a large basin between the north and north east ridges, the corrie is drained by the Allt Coire Dubchraig which flows north east to join the River Fillan. At the foot of the northern corrie are remnants of an old Scots Pine wood of Coille Coire Chuilc, part of the former Caledonian Forest. These northern foothills of the mountain were once heavily mined for lead and there are still prominent scars on the hillside. The Clan Campbell wrecked the mine workings in 1745 as they were then owned by a prominent Jacobite Sir Robert Clifton. The mine workings closed eventually in 1923.\\"Hamish‚Äòs Mountain Walk\\" Pages 79 & 80 (Gives info pine forest and lead mining). Beinn Dubhchraig is linked to the adjacent Munro of Ben Oss, which lies two kilometres to the west, by the Bealach Buidhe which has a height of 779 metres. The ridge down to the bealach is broad and holds a few small lochans within the schist rock hollows. There are corries to both the north and south of the bealach. Coire Garbh to the south holds Loch Oss, a sheet of water measuring roughly 500 metres by 300 metres with a small island located within it. To the north of the bealach is Coire Buidhe which has a very steep headwall which prevents a direct descent from the bealach down to the Cononish valley to the north.\\"The Munros\\" Pages 20 (Details steepness of Coire Buidhe). To the east, Beinn Dubhchraig falls to the valley of Gleann Auchreoch, much of these lower eastern slopes were planted with conifers in the early 1970s and have become an obstacle to approaches to the mountain from that direction.  Ascents  The ascent of Beinn Dubchraig starts from the hamlet of Dalrigh on the A82 at grid reference and takes the track which crosses the railway and follows the Allt Coire Dubchraig through the wood. The track becomes more muddy and crosses three deer fences by stiles to reach the open mountainside from where it is possible to ascend the northern corrie direct to reach the summit plateau just to the north west of the highest point.\\"The Munros Almanac\\" Page 19 (Gives Route of Ascent). Beinn Dubhchraig is often climbed in conjunction with some or all of the mountains around the Cononish valley. The view from the summit gives fine views of the mountains of Breadalbane to the west and the twin Munros of Ben More and Stob Binnein are well seen to the south east.

The university rector Suraphol Nitikraipot and assistant rector for student affairs Prinya Thewanaruemitkul at Thammasat University, at which Chotiros was a senior at the Faculty of Liberal Arts, forced Chotiros to appear before a press conference with deans of the university, and made her apologize for her actions.

A person called Mahamandaleshwar has been elevated by his peers to the highest level of traditional, Hindu spiritual guardianship. Today India has 530 Mahamandaleshwars who carry on the work begun by Adi Shankaracharya 1200 years ago. Literally, \\"Mahamandaleshwar\\" means \\"Superior of great and/or numerous monasteries\\" or \\"Superior of a religious district or province\\" (maha = great, mandala = district, ishwara = head, sovereign). There are two systems of organization in the dashanami order. Each of the ten names (dasha = ten, nami = name), which is appended to a monk's given name at initiation, is assigned to one of the four cardinal monastic seats founded by Shankaracharya and presided over by his direct successors at Joshimath in North India, Dwarka in the West, Shringeri in the South and Puri in the East. Akhara system The other system is the akhara system of which the Mahamandaleshwaras are a part. Their origin dates from the early days of Islamic invasions into India (around or just prior to 1000 CE) when many monks became the targets of murderous attacks. In order to protect themselves, they formed \\"regiments\\" of monk- warriors who, to this day, preserve the traditional martial arts of India in addition to their spiritual practices. So in addition to being a way to organize the orders at a local level they have historically also served as paramilitary regiments with the Mahamandaleshwaras as generals, as it were, of these regiments. As of now, Shri Ashutoshgiri Goswami (who is also Mahant of Bhimnath Mahadev, Gujarat) is Mahamandaleshwar crowned by Swami Avdeshanandji at the pious (and Equally Popular) Kumbha Mela. At the same time, Swami Avdeshanandji announced Bhimnath Mahadev as a \\"Pith\\" and Mahant of Bhimnath will also be called as \\"Pithadheesh\\".

Influenced by other Jadid journals, Qazaq was considered to be a medium promoting the emerging Kazakh nationalism against Tsarist imperial policies. Qazaq published articles on the Kazakh culture, colonization of lands by Russian settlers, taxation issues, educational issues, pros and cons of Kazakh nomadic life and ongoing settlements etc. The founders of Qazaq newspaper wanted to introduce western style reforms to the Kazakh lands as a first step in the gradual progress of Kazakh people towards autonomy and independence. Influenced by Western scientific and cultural achievements, contributors to the Qazaq newspaper wanted to introduce similar reforms to the nomadic Kazakhs. They thought nomadic life style is backward, and Kazakhs should sedenterize in order to resist Russian imperial policies, which were dislocating the nomadic life style. Although Soviet historians considered Qazaq as conservative, the journal had a strong reformist, progressive agenda. Both the Qazaq and Ay Qap were in favour of sedenterization, literacy, and westernization. Those who favoured more western-style reforms contributed to Qazaq, while those who favoured Middle Eastern cultures as a model published Ay Qap at about the same time. Both journals wanted to realize autonomy and independence for Kazakhs, and they both envisioned reformation of Kazakh culture as a precondition for gradual realization of these goals.

Biography The son of an electrician, and himself an electrician by trade, O'Neill was largely self-taught, although he briefly attended Belfast College of Art life classes, before working with and studying under fellow Belfast artist Sidney Smith. He quickly developed an expressionist technique, and strong romanticism, with imagery, often full of pathos, evoking the themes of love, life and death. The start of his painting career coincided with the outbreak of World War II and after the 1941 Belfast Blitz he salvaged wood and experimented with wood carving. O'Neill's first exhibition was at the Mol Gallery in Belfast in 1941. Within five years, Dublin art dealer Victor Waddington became involved, resulting in O'Neill having a regular income which allowed him to give up his day-job as an electrician, and focus on painting full-time. In 1946 he sold 21 pictures out of 23 at an exhibition at the Waddington Galleries in Dublin and from then on exhibited regularly. In 1949 he visited Paris and was influenced by Georges Rouault, Maurice de Vlaminck and Maurice Utrillo. A number of works followed on which his reputation largely rests, including: Place du Tertre (1949), The Blue Skirt (1949), Knockalla Hills, Donegal (1951) and Birth (1952). His later work, largely brighter in colour, was seen by critics as less successful. In 1951 his work was shown in the Tooth Galleries, London and he also exhibited there with Colin Middleton in 1954. In the 1950s, O'Neill moved from Belfast to Conlig, County Down, where there was a small artist's colony that also included George Campbell and Gerard Dillon. Along with Colin Middleton, Gerard Dillon and George Campbell he was one of a group of artists who respected each other‚Äôs work and kept in touch over the course of their careers. However, after the closure of the Waddington Gallery in Dublin, O‚ÄôNeill found it difficult to exist as a painter. He lived in London from 1958 to 1971 and his work in this period was increasingly introspective and often desolate. In 1970 George McClelland invited O‚ÄôNeill to exhibit a one-man show, Recent Paintings, at his Belfast gallery, and provided O'Neill with accommodation and a studio to work in. It was his first one-man show in 18 years and was a complete sell out. However, this return to good fortune was not sustained as McClelland Galleries was badly affected by the civil unrest in Belfast in the early 1970s. O'Neill returned to Belfast in 1971, where he died in 1974. During his lifetime, O'Neill's works were primarily exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy. More recently, some of his paintings were shown at the Irish Museum of Modern Art as part of a 2005 exhibition of Northern Irish artists. His work is represented in many collections including the Ulster Museum, Queen's University Belfast and the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery, Dublin.

He was a regular collaborator with leading Flemish and Dutch figure painters of his time. Van Thielen was the most popular flower painter in Flanders and his patrons included Diego Felipez de Guzm√°n, 1st Marquis of Legan√©s and Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the art-loving governor of the Southern Netherlands.Jan Philip van Thielen at the Prado Life Van Thielen was born in Mechelen as the son of a minor nobleman by the name of Liebrecht van Thielen. Jan Philip would eventually assume his father‚Äôs title of Lord of Couwenberch. His mother was Anna Rigouts or Rigouldts. He signed some of his paintings with his mother‚Äôs name. Roses and a tulip in a glass vase He left his native Mechelen for Antwerp where in 1631 or 1632 he started his training as a painter with his brother-in-law Theodoor Rombouts.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1132‚Äì1133 Theodoor Rombouts was a prominent history painter who had married Jan Philip's sister Anna in 1627.Philip van Thielen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Theodoor Rombouts at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In 1693 van Thielen married Francisca de Hemelaer. Through his marriage he was the brother-in-law of Erasmus Quellinus II. Erasmus Quelllinus was married to the sister of his wife and would become one of the leading history painters in Flanders after the deaths of Rubens and van Dyck.Erasmus Quellinus, in de voetsporen van Rubens, Exhibition Catalogue, Mus√©e de Flandre, 2014 Quellinus drew van Thielens' portrait that was engraved by Richard Collin for Cornelis de Bie's book of artist biographies Het Gulden Cabinet. Van Thielen and his wife had 9 children. Garland of flowers Because he liked flower painting he changed masters in 1641 and began training with Daniel Seghers, the leading flower painter in Flanders. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1641. In 1660 he moved with his family to his hometown Mechelen where he became a master in the local Guild of Saint Luke the next year. Three of van Thielen‚Äôs daughters became flower painters: Maria Theresa van Thielen (1640‚Äì1706), Anna-Maria (b 1641) and Francisca-Catherina (b 1645). Only works of the eldest sister have come down to us as the two younger sisters entered convents. The sisters must have been exceptional flower painters as they were praised by their contemporary, the artist biographer Cornelis de Bie in his Het Gulden Cabinet published in 1662.Jan Philip van Thielen biography in: Cornelis de Bie, 'Het gulden cabinet vande edel vry schilder const: inhoudende den lof vande vermarste schilders, architecten, beldthouwers ende plaetsnyders, van dese eeuw, Antwerpen, 1661, p. 347 Van Thielen was the teacher of his daughters and also taught a certain N. Bainville in Mechelen. He died in 1667 in Booischot. Work=General Van Thielen painted flower pieces as well as garland paintings with dates ranging from 1646 to 1667. As his paintings are generally signed it has been possible to establish the chronology and development of his oeuvre. He signed with I. P. Van Thielen Rigouldts (after his mother) in the 1640s, I. P. Van Thielen after 1650, and I. P. Van Thielen Heere Van CouwenBerche on later works in the 1660s, after he had assumed the title of Lord of Couwenberch.Jean-Pierre de Bruyn. \\"Thielen, Jan Philips van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 April 2015 Vase of flowers on a ledge Flower pieces The style of his flower pieces is less spontaneous than that of his master Seghers. Each flower stands out individually rather than blending into the composition as a whole. In his flower paintings he demonstrated his skills as a colourist, which contributed to his commercial success. An example is the Roses and a tulip in a glass vase in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.Jan Philips van Thielen, Roses and a Tulip in a Glass Vase at the National Gallery of Art Garland paintings Van Thielen regularly worked on garland paintings in which the staffage was painted by other artists. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hendrick van Balen at the request of the Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo at the beginning of the 17th century.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included his master Daniel Seghers, Andries Daniels and Peter Paul Rubens. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement. It was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image, portrait or other religious symbol (such as the host). The paintings are usually a collaboration between a flower painter and a staffage painter. Stone Cartouche with Virgin and Child in a Garland of Flowers Van Thielen produced multiple garland paintings in collaboration with other artists. His collaborators included his brother-in- law Erasmus Quellinus II, Nicolas de Largilliere, Jan van Balen, Frans Francken the Younger, Cornelis Schut and Cornelis van Poelenburch. The cartouches in the garlands typically depict religious or mythological themes. Unlike his master Seghers whose flower garlands are dynamic, van Thielen arranged the flowers and leaves of his flower garlands in a regular manner. An example of a collaboration of van Thielen and Quellinus on a garland painting is A Stone Cartouche with the Virgin and Child, Encircled by a Garland of Flowers (Chrysler Museum of Art) (1651), which is signed by both artists. Van Thielen painted the flower garland while his brother-in-law Erasmus Quellinus painted the cartouche. The cartouche painted by Quellinus in grisaille represents sculptures of the Virgin and Christ Child subduing the serpent. The serpent clutches the apple of Original Sin. The intricate stone cartouche is crowned at the upper corners with a pair of swans. Van Thielen painted ivy (a symbol of death, remembrance and eternal life) into the cartouches and added a variety of flowers: roses, jasmine, daffodils, snow drops, hydrangea, nasturtium, apple blossoms, anemones. Each flower alludes to the virtues of the Virgin and Child. Van Thielen also added moths and butterflies, which are symbols of the resurrection of Christ and his triumph over death. As the flowers include both spring and summer blooms, they are not based on a real- life bouquet. They symbolize the eternal virtues of the Virgin and Child.A Stone Cartouche with the Virgin and Child, Encircled by a Garland of Flowers at the Chrysler Museum of Art Collections The Ashmolean Museum (University of Oxford), the Fitzwilliam Museum (University of Cambridge), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.) and the Pinacoteca di Brera (Milan) are among the public collections holding paintings by Jan Philip van Thielen.

E. Gracia (born 1942) is a Cuban-born American philosopher who is the Samuel P. Capen Chair, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Department of Comparative Literature in the State University of New York at Buffalo. Gracia was educated in Cuba, the United States, Canada, and Spain, and received his Ph.D. in Medieval Philosophy from the University of Toronto. Gracia has authored or edited over forty books. His areas of specialization include Metaphysics/Ontology, Philosophical Historiography, Philosophy of Language/Hermeneutics, Ethnicity/Race/Nationality Issues, Hispanic/Latino Issues, Medieval/Scholastic Philosophy and Hispanic/Latino/Latin-American/Latinx Philosophy. While Gracia's earlier work was primarily in the areas of Medieval Philosophy and Metaphysics, much of his recent work has focused on issues of race, ethnicity and identity. His contributions to the philosophical study of race and ethnicity have been groundbreaking. It is within this area that Gracia proposed his familial- historical view of ethnicity and his genetic common-bundle view of race. These views of race and ethnicity have helped to shape the field and addressed many issues that previous theories had left unanswered. Gracia was the founding chair of the APA Committee for Hispanics in Philosophy, past president of the Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy, past president of the Society for Iberian and Latin American Thought, past president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association, and past president of the Metaphysical Society of America.  Education  Gracia studied architecture at Universidad de La Habana and also took classes at Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes San Alejandro, both in Havana, Cuba, for a year before coming to United States and earning a B.A. in philosophy at Wheaton College (Ill.) in 1965. In his book Painting Borges, he narrates how he changed his field of study from architecture to mathematics to English literature to philosophy because he became \\"enthralled by language\\" and \\"craved ... to know [its] secret.\\" He received his M.A. in philosophy from University of Chicago in 1966, M.S.L. (Licentiate in Mediaeval Studies) in philosophy from Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in 1970, and Ph.D. in Medieval philosophy from University of Toronto in 1971. During his graduate studies he spent a year (1969-1970) at Institut d'Estudis Catalans for study and research. Work=History of medieval philosophy Gracia has written extensively on the problem of individuation in the early Middle Ages. Within this context, he has explored Boethius and his metaphysical and logical approaches to the problem of individuation. He has also dealt with the metaphysical views of Thierry of Chartres, Gilbert of Potiers, Peter Abailard and others. He wrote the first book on the development of the problem of individuation in the early Middle Ages, the period that goes from the 6th century to the 14th. In this book, he applied a new, analytic problems approach method to the history of medieval philosophy. Gracia has studied and written on the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, focusing on Aquinas' Christian philosophy, his approach to universals, and his metaphysics of thought and existence. History of Spanish philosophy Gracia has explored the work of Francisco Su√°rez, focusing on his metaphysics as well as the issues of individuation and good and evil. He has also translated Su√°rez's Disputations V, X, and XI and published commentaries and editions of these. He has also studied Ramon Llull's work on metaphysics and individuation and written on Jos√© Ortega y Gasset. Contemporary Latin American and Latinx philosophy Gracia has published many articles on the work of Latin American philosophers and explored their work in terms of the impact it has had upon Latin America. The research has also extended to the exploration of Latin American art and literature. He was a pioneer in this field. The anthology on Latin American philosophy he edited in the mid-1980s was the first work of its nature published in English by a philosopher. Philosophical historiography Gracia's work in this area has examined the concept of Hispanic philosophy and presented a historico-relational understanding of it. In addition, Gracia has described the origin of Hispanic philosophy in the 16th century. He presented a historical account of discussions concerning the controversy about the nature of Latin-American philosophy and developed a historiographical model for the understanding of Hispanic thought. Gracia has also focused on a systematic treatment of the main issues involved in philosophical historiography. He has dealt with such topics as the relation of philosophy to its history, the role of value judgments in historical accounts, the value of the history of philosophy for philosophy, the nature and role of texts and their interpretation in the history of philosophy, historiographical method, and the stages of development and progress of philosophical ideas. His book on the historiography of philosophy is the most comprehensive study of this topic in English. Metaphysics Gracia has published many works in the area of metaphysics. He has devoted extensive time dealing with the metaphysical/ontological issues posed by categories. In this work, Gracia has also offered a systematic analysis of the nature of metaphysics which provides an answer as to why metaphysics always recovers from the many attacks to which it has been subjected throughout its history. Apart from a new conception of metaphysics and an explanation of the resilience of the discipline, Gracia presents an understanding of the nature and ontological status of categories, an analysis of the nature of reductionism and its role in philosophy, and a discussion and criticism of the main views concerning the nature of metaphysics developed in the history of philosophy. Gracia also distinguishes six fundamental issues in the metaphysics of individuality: intension, extension, ontological status, the principle of individuation, discernibility, and reference. He has taken new and controversial positions in all these topics. Hermeneutics Gracia has written on the logical and epistemological dimensions of a theory of textuality which takes into account the relevant views of both analytic and Continental thinkers and also of some major historical figures. He has given a logical analysis of the notion of text resulting from a definition that serves as the basis for the distinctions subsequently drawn between texts on the one hand and language, artifacts, art objects, and works on the other; and for the classification of texts according to modality and function. He has used his conclusions in this area to solve the various epistemological issues which have been raised about texts by philosophers of language, semioticians, hermeneuticists, literary critics, semanticists, aestheticians, and historiographers. Gracia has provided an ontological characterization of texts; it explores the issues raised by the identity of various texts; and it presents a view of the identity and function of authors and audiences and of their relations to texts. Philosophy of religion Gracia has written a philosophical understanding of the conditions that must be satisfied by the interpretation of texts which are regarded as revealed by religious communities. He has focused on the issues of revelation, interpretation, various kinds of hermeneutical views (authorial, audiencial, literary, sociological, and theological), definitive interpretations, and the relativity of interpretations. He has argued for the preeminence of theological interpretations, for the logical possibility but the factual difficulty of definitive interpretations of revelation, and for the relativity of, but not relativism in, these interpretations. Gracia has also written on religious skepticism in Latin America. Race, ethnicity, and nationality Gracia has examined the nature of tradition and how a proper metaphysical understanding of this notion as a kind of action clarifies its various uses and helps us understand in turn how communication, the preservation of knowledge, and group identity take place. He has also published a systematic discussion of the notions of race, ethnicity, and nationality. He has written on the metaphysical questions of \\"What is race?\\" and \\"What is ethnicity.\\" It is within this area that Gracia has proposed his familial-historical view of ethnicity and his genetic common-bundle view of race. These views of race and ethnicity have helped to shape the field and addressed many issues that previous theories had left unanswered. Hispanic/Latino Issues Gracia published systematic discussions of social issues that affect Latinos/Hispanics in American society. As well, Gracia presents a familial/relational theory of Hispanic/Latino identity. In addition he discusses such topics as the nature of ethnicity, the proper name for Hispanics/Latinos, the origin of Hispanic/Latino identity, the role of mestizaje in Hispanic/Latino identity, the history of discussions of Latin American identity in Latin America, and the situation of Hispanics/Latinos in American philosophy today. Within this work Gracia takes into account recent research in various disciplines: anthropology, sociology, history, philosophy, literature, and Latino studies.

In October 2018, Liautaud was included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. At this time, Forbes estimated Liautaud's documented wealth at $1.7 billion. Family and early life James P. Liautaud with son, Jimmy John's founder Jimmy John Liautaud Liautaud was born in Arlington Heights, Illinois on January 12, 1964. His father is James Liautaud, longtime entrepreneur, and his mother is Gina Gudaityte Liautaud. He was born the second of four siblings, with brothers Greg and Robby Liautaud and a sister Lara Liautaud Berry. He attended high school at Elgin Academy, a private prep school in Elgin, Illinois, where he became close with and was influenced by the dean, James Lyons. He studied at Eastern Illinois University, but left to grow his up-and-coming restaurant business. Restaurant career Jimmy John Liautaud and Jimmy John's franchise owner Drew Brees After Liautaud graduated from high school in 1982, his father offered him a loan of $25,000 to open a business on the condition that when the business failed, he would enlist in the US Army. Although his father wanted him to enlist, he agreed to loan the money in exchange for a 48% stake in the business. Initially Jimmy John wanted to open a hot dog stand, but after visiting numerous such stands throughout the summer of 1982, he realized the $25,000 would not be enough for such a venture. After a chance encounter at a sandwich shop, Jimmy John realized that he could open a sandwich shop within his available budget by purchasing premium meats at a neighborhood market and baking his own bread. With the help of his family as tasters, he decided to put four sandwiches on his original menu. On January 13, 1983 Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches opened in Charleston, Illinois. Due to the poor location of his first store, Liautaud decided to include delivery of his sandwiches to boost sales. He began by bringing samples door-to-door to the nearby Eastern Illinois University dorms. By the end of his first year, the restaurant started making a profit. At the end of his second year, Liautaud was able to purchase his father's share in the business and he became sole owner. The business continued to grow, and he was able to open his second and third shops in 1986 and 1987. In 1988, Liautaud met businessman Jamie Coulter. At the time, Coulter was a Pizza Hut Franchisee, and later founded and ran Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon and other chains. Coulter helped Liautaud take his business to the next level. In 1994 he sold his first Jimmy John's franchise, in addition to the 10 stores owned by Liautaud himself. By 2002, the company had about 200 stores, 10% of which were corporate stores that Liautaud oversaw himself. Sales at the stores managed by Liautaud were outpacing the franchised stores by a wide margin. Together with his partner, and now President & CEO, James North, he visited 70 of the poorest-performing stores. After 18 months of getting the stores ‚Äúback to basics‚Äù and instilling in them ‚Äúsome of that initial spark‚Äù, he was able to help the stores become more profitable. Jimmy John Liautaud with Jimmy John's president James North In January 2007, Liautaud selected Weston Presidio, a private-equity firm, to help acquire better locations for the expanding company. Weston Presidio bought a 33% stake in the company, and during the first year closed on over 100 real estate deals. In September 2016, Roark Capital Group agreed to purchase a majority stake in Liautaud's company, as Weston Presidio sold their minority investment after 10 years. Terms of the transaction were not immediately disclosed, though it was later clarified that Liautaud retained 35% ownership of the company as part of the deal. As part of the agreement, Liautaud, as the company's founder and largest individual shareholder, continued as chairman of the board. In his 2018 book, Dick Portillo of Portillo's Restaurants called Liautaud his \\"good friend\\" and relayed that Liautaud tried to buy Portillo's before it was ultimately sold to Berkshire Partners. In September 2019, Roark's Inspire Brands announced it was acquiring Jimmy John's for an unspecified amount in a deal unanimously approved by Liautaud and the rest of the Jimmy John's Board of Directors. At the close of the deal, Liautaud said that he will step down as chairman of the company and transition to become an adviser to the brand. The acquisition was completed on October 18. Philanthropy In 2008, Liautaud donated $1 million to his high school, Elgin Academy, on the condition that the building constructed using his donation bear not only his name, but also the name of the man who had been the dean of the school when Liautaud attended: James Lyons. Jimmy John Liautaud donating $1 million to Major Dan Rooney and Folds of Honor. In 2011, Liautaud and his wife pledged $1 million toward the construction of the new Champaign County YMCA. In July 2014, Liautaud donated $1 million to the Folds of Honor Foundation, an organization that supports the spouses and children of America‚Äôs fallen and disabled service-members. In 2017, Liautaud and his wife, Leslie, donated $2 million to help Brewster Academy kick off the fundraising for their new residence hall to house 22 students and 4 faculty residences. In May 2018, the new residence opened, and is called \\"Toad Hall\\" after a common mispronunciation of the family's last name. In January 2019, Camp Southern Ground, a non-profit summer camp founded by musician Zac Brown, announced that the Liautauds had donated over $3.2 million to date to help build the camp's first residential lodge and fund ongoing operations. In non-summer months, the camp's facilities are used to support military veterans and their families transitioning back to civilian life. The Liautaud Family Foundation directed $1.291 million to the Horatio Alger Association to support scholarships for underprivileged students in 2019. Liautaud partnered with his father to create with an endowment gift of $5 million, the Liautaud Graduate School of Business at the University of Illinois-Chicago. The Liautauds donated $1 million to Chicago‚Äôs Youth Guidance Becoming a Man program, which helps disadvantaged young men learn how to handle tough life challenges and give them the tools to succeed in the future. Other causes supported by the Liautauds include: the Frances Nelson Smile Healthy Dental Clinic, the Kickapoo Rail Trail, Crisis Nursery in Urbana, Illinois, Champaign County's Youth Assessment Center,, Champaign Unit 4 schools, Christmas layaway purchases, the American Heart Association, the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine, MD Anderson, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, the Lurie Children‚Äôs Hospital of Chicago, the Goodman Theater, and the Detroit Symphony. Honors Liautaud is a member of the University of Illinois at Chicago's Chicago Area Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame. In 2003, he was named to Chicago's ‚Äú40 Under 40‚Äù by Crain's Chicago Business. In 2004, he was named the Ernst & Young Food & Beverage Entrepreneur of the Year in Illinois. The winners were selected by an independent panel of judges composed of local community and business leaders. In the same year, he was given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the National CEO Conference and inducted into the Collegiate Entrepreneurs' Organization Hall of Fame. In 2007, Liautaud delivered the commencement speech at his alma mater, now known as the Liautaud-Lyons Upper School, a program of Elgin Academy. In 2012, Liautaud was awarded the Nation's Restaurant News Golden Chain award for outstanding accomplishments that have benefited consumers in the food industry. In March 2017, he was named Franchise Times' \\"Dealmaker of the Year\\" for the deal that brought Roark Capital Group in as the company's new majority owner. Beth Ewen, FT's editor-in-chief called the deal \\"one of the best private equity deals of all time in the restaurant business.\\" In December of that year, Liautaud was chosen to receive the Horatio Alger Award for 2018. The Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans recognizes people who have overcome personal challenges to achieve personal and professional success.  Public speaking  Liautaud has spoken at high schools; colleges and universities; and community spaces. Hunting Liautaud is an avid hunter and fisherman. In an interview in 2015 with the Chicago Tribune, Liautaud said that the largest misconception about him is that people still connect him to photos of him posing with big game from 10 years ago. According to Liautaud, he used to hunt big game in Africa on legally organized safaris, but he no longer does. Starting in 2015, his hunting prompted people to call for a boycott of his business. Personal life Liautaud is married to Leslie Liautaud and has three children, Spencer, Lucy, and Fred. Liautaud is an investor in wines and vineyards, at least one of which has been featured on the cover of Wine Spectator. He also owns thousands of acres of farmland in Central Illinois. Liautaud also owns a superyacht named ROCK.IT, a 198-foot ship built with his input by Feadship in 2014. The ship, which can accommodate ten guests with a crew of 13, has been a finalist for a few yacht awards and been featured in a number of industry publications. Leslie Liautaud is a supporter of Donald Trump. She donated $446,500 to the Trump 2016 campaign and at least $100,000 in the 2020 election cycle.

The Spear (Greek: ŒªœåŒ≥œáŒ∑; Slavonic: –ö–æ–ø—ñ–µÃÅ) or Lance is a liturgical implement used during the Divine Liturgy in the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches. The Spear symbolizes the lance of Longinus that was used at the time of Christ's death on the Cross to pierce his side, from which flowed blood and water (). This event is traditionally interpreted as prefiguring the Sacred Mysteries (Sacraments) of the Eucharist and Baptism. The Spear is one of the Sacred Vessels usually kept on the Table of Oblation (Prothesis), where the bread and wine are prepared for the Eucharist. Often when a Chalice and Diskos (Paten) are made, an Asterisk and a Spoon and Spear will be made to match them. The Spear is normally made of precious metal (or at least plated with silver and/or gold), has a point sharp enough to cut the bread, and will often have a cross at the end of the handle. The Spear is used during the Liturgy of Preparation when the priest cuts the Lamb (Host) out of the Prosphoron (loaf of leavened bread) which will be consecrated to become the Body of Christ. The Spear is also used before Holy Communion to cut the Lamb into pieces for the clergy and faithful to communicate from. In the Euchologion there is also a special Prayer of the Spear which may be said by the priest when one is sick. The Spear, being a sanctified object, may not be used for any purpose than the liturgical uses for which it is appointed.

The similarly named Reichsthaler, riksdaler and rijksdaalder were used in Germany and Austria-Hungary, Sweden and the Netherlands, respectively. History During the real union between Denmark and Norway, Danish currency circulated alongside Norwegian. Norway itself issued currency denominated in two different rigsdaler, the rigsdaler courant and the rigsdaler specie, with 96 skilling to the rigsdaler courant and 120 skilling to the rigsdaler specie. In 1816, following the establishment of the union between Sweden and Norway, the rigsdaler specie was renamed the speciedaler and became the standard unit of currency in Norway.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, coins were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 skilling, , , , , and 1 rigsdaler specie. Banknotes In 1695, government notes were issued for 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100 rigsdaler (spelt rixdaler). In 1807, notes were reintroduced by the government, in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 100 rigsdaler courant, with 12 skilling notes added in 1810. In 1813, Rigsbankens Norske Avdeling began issuing notes. in denominations of 1, 5, 50, and 100 Rigsbankdaler. Subsequent series were issued by Norges Midlertidige Rigsbank (1814), Stattholderbevis (1815), and Norges Bank (1817‚Äì22 to the present). Norwegian speciedaler The speciedaler (or specie-dollar) was the currency of Norway between 1816 and 1875. It replaced the rigsdaler specie at par and was subdivided into 5 marks or 120 skilling (called skilling species on some issues), each mark therefore subdivided into 24 skillings. It was replaced by the Norwegian krone when Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union. An equal valued krone/krona of the monetary union replaced the three currencies at the rate of 1 krone/krona = Danish rigsdaler = Norwegian speciedaler = 1 Swedish riksdaler. Coins In 1816, coins in circulation from the previous currency remained in circulation, with only 1 skilling coins being minted. A new coinage was introduced in 1819, consisting of copper 1 and 2 skilling and silver 8 and 24 skilling, and 1 specidaler. Silver 2 and 4 skilling coins were introduced in 1825, followed by copper skilling pieces in 1839, silver 12 skilling in 1845 and silver 3 skilling in 1868. It was made out of Iron.

Suzuka=Main charactersSuzuka Asahina= : * : The titular heroine of the series, she is a talented female high jumper from Yokohama that was scouted by many famous high schools because of her skill. While in Tokyo, she lives in Ayano‚Äôs dormitory, next door to Yamato. She is a serious athlete that puts a lot of pressure on herself to perform so she does not disappoint others. At first, she has a very cold attitude toward Yamato, but according to her sister, Suzuka only shows her arrogant and somewhat moody attitude to someone she likes,. thus showing the characteristics of a tsundere. Because of her past with Kazuki, she was reluctant to express her feelings toward Yamato and ended up trying to push him away for a very long time. Her reaction in the manga and anime was to slap him repeatedly the first time he kissed her. Later in the manga, after they had gone out a short while, he tried to kiss her again and was met with another slap. Then, after a misunderstanding, Suzuka threatened to slap him again, and when he closed his eyes she kissed him, followed up with yet another slap to the face. After a while, she finally admits to herself and to Yamato that she has liked him since the first time they met, and they begin dating. : Their relationship was rocky from the start because of Yamato‚Äôs carelessness and Suzuka's guarded attitude to her thoughts and feelings. She decides to take the offer to study abroad from Sasoka, claiming the training standards are higher and she will benefit more, but it was really because Yamato complimented her on how cool she looked during her high-jump. After the time-skip, Suzuka moved back into her room next door to Yamato. She, like Yamato, was recommended to Seijo University, which she plans on attending. After Yamato told her he wanted to rekindle their relationship, she was against the idea because she was afraid that if they date again, they will begin to hate each other and drift apart. When Yamato shows his devotion to her, they get back together. Things once again became unsettled after Yamato tries to further their relationship to a physical one. She reacted by slapping him when he groped her. After he apologized, she stated that she was simply nervous of the idea, but that if he wanted to, she would take that step forward. After being caught on their secret trip by her father, she is forced to move back home. Meanwhile she feels ill. After Yamato works out the problems with his father, he convinces her to go get the illness checked out. When she comes out, she reveals that the illness was actually morning sickness, as she is three months pregnant. She initially decides to have an abortion because she doesn't want to disappoint their families and friends. However, after much discussion with Yamato, they both decided to keep the baby and get married, and decided to drop out of the university. Even though Yamato has to get employed to support his new family, Suzuka wants him to get a job in a company which has a track team. Their child was revealed to be a girl named F≈´ka. : In the manga sequel, Fuuka, Suzuka's full name is now \\"Suzuka Akitsuki\\" after marrying Yamato. While Suzuka is a loving wife and mother, she and Yamato still fight, often over their children. While Yamato tried to get Fuuka to follow in their footsteps as a track and field athlete, Suzuka disagreed and wanted their daughter to be whatever she chose to be. Suzuka and Yamato have a second daughter named Haruka (Êò•Ëä±, \\"spring, flower\\"; name revealed in Fuuka chapter 74), but their first child, Fuuka, dies in a car accident at age 15. : The given name for Suzuka is derived from the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Sukukaze. In Chapter 174 of A Town Where You Live, she is seen with Akari, Kiyomi and Nanami in a bath. She and F≈´ka make a brief appearance at Fantasy Land in Chapter 126, on board a train in Chapter 257, and in both the OVA's. In Chapter 81 of A Town Where You Live, Suzuka is revealed (indirectly) to be 21 years old. =Yamato Akitsuki= : * : The main protagonist of the series. He moved from his home in rural Hiroshima to his aunt‚Äôs dormitory in Tokyo to change himself. While checking out his new high school, he sees a beautiful high jumper practicing and falls in love at first sight. By chance she happens to be his next door neighbor, Suzuka Asahina. Yamato is clumsy and has a carefree attitude, which often gets him into comprising situations. He has an almost spineless attitude when it comes to defending his position on a subject when confronted and his need to apologize constantly when he thinks he did something wrong makes him a generally weak willed character. When the need arises, he can become focused and determined. He is exceedingly clueless when it comes to girls and their feelings except for the fact the Suzuka is not your typical girl and would be hard for anyone to read. Although not the best in academics, he discovered a natural gift as a sprinter, and joined the track and field team. During his senior year of high school, he became a well-liked and respected track captain. Even though he did not achieve his goal of becoming first nationally during high school in the 100 meters, he was scouted and recommended to attend two universities, either Tohto University or Seijo University. : After being released from his promise with Saki and realizing that he was still in love with Suzuka, he decided to try for acceptance to Seijo University. When he confessed to Suzuka that he wanted to restart their relationship, she stated that she did not because of the fear of getting hurt. Through patience, understanding, and persistence, they made up. During Seijo University's track tryouts, Yamato performed poorly at the start of his race, but showed enough potential at the end for the Selection Committee to unanimously choose him for the scholarship. Pressured by Yasunobu, Yamato decided to take his relationship to the next level. Suzuka initially was against it, but Yamato sets her at ease and they take a step forward in the relationship. Three months later, he learns that Suzuka is pregnant. He is troubled by the decision of her having an abortion and going to the University or keeping the baby and skipping school to work. He admitted to Suzuka that he wants her to keep the baby. After much discussion between the two they both decided to keep the baby and get married, and decided to drop out of the university. It was revealed that they had a daughter named F≈´ka (È¢®Â§è, \\"windy summer\\" or alternately, \\"summer wind\\"). :In the manga sequel, Fuuka, it is revealed that Yamato fulfilled his dreams and became a 100 Meter Olympic athlete champion, and won the silver medal in the world championships against Emerson. He and Suzuka had a second daughter named Haruka (Êò•Ëä±, \\"spring, flower\\"; name revealed in Fuuka chapter 74), who was born on the day he won the silver medal. While he is a loving husband and father, he and Suzuka still fight, often over their children. However, his first daughter, Fuuka, dies in a car accident at age 15. : The character name is derived from the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Akizuki and battleship Yamato. =Honoka Sakurai= : * : She met Yamato from an incident that happened in their childhood at her family‚Äôs shrine that he often went to when visiting his aunt. Ever since, Honoka has had a crush on him, but was too shy to talk to him. Much to her shock, Yamato entered her high school and was even part of her class. Seeing her opportunity, she begins to talk with him and they become friends. When Yamato joins the track team, she decides to become the manager so they do not grow apart. After a little while, she finally confesses her feelings to Yamato and they begin dating. The relationship lasts less than a month because of Yamato‚Äôs carelessness and Honoka‚Äôs own insecurities. After realizing her mistake, she claims that she wants to confess again when she gains more confidence. When she learns that Yamato and Suzuka are dating, she decides to quit being the track manager and take up an offer made by the modeling agency of her best friend, Nana. After a modeling shoot, she happens to run into Yamato again after he has broken up with Suzuka. She clearly still harbors feelings for him but being a popular model, she has become more confident and now can openly talk with him. While at the beach, she asked Yamato if they should be a couple again but in a fit of nervousness played it off as a joke but then asked again. Yamato responded by saying she was important but confused by her earlier nervous play off he asked if it was a joke Because of this incident, she decided to no longer wait for Yamato and began dating a coworker who confessed to her. Honoka met Yamato again and told him they shouldn't meet anymore because she has a boyfriend. Her design was reused for Yuzuki Eba in Kouji Seo's new series A Town Where You Live and she was mentioned briefly on a television show telling about her love situation with Yamato to the audience. She graduated with Yamato and the others. She was also in Suzuka's and Yamato's wedding. =Yasunobu Hattori= : * :Has been friends with Yamato since they were kids. They often met whenever Yamato came to stay with his aunt Ayano; however, Hattori would frequently get Yamato in trouble, since Hattori would take advantage of the fact that Ayano's dormitory also contained a women's bath. He is a ladies' man that, according to Yamato, prefers perverted stuff over eating.. He dreams of dating all the girls in the world and the legalization of polygyny in Japan. Yasunobu is often giving relationship advice to Yamato, with rather amusing results, due to the latter's being clueless and tendency to screw up. Even though he sometimes gets Yamato in bad situations, he usually has Yamato‚Äôs best interests in mind. Much to Yamato and Miki's surprise, Yasunobu has been a straight \\"A\\" student during high school. Yasunobu and Miki recently have made cameos in Chapter 67 of A Town Where You Live where they were meeting each other during Haruto's class trip to Tokyo. : The character name is derived from one of Kouji Seo's real-life friends. =Miki Hashiba= : * : Miki is a first year high school student and member of the school field and track team as a sprinter. She is best friends with Suzuka and later Yamato. Before they began attending the same high school, Miki had often encountered Suzuka during track meets and disliked her because Suzuka came off as cold and aloof. However, once she realized that Suzuka's distant nature resulted from her perfectionist tendencies and dedication to her sport, Miki came to respect Suzuka and they became friends. Although initially attracted to Yamato Akitsuki, upon realizing he was infatuated with her best friend Suzuka, she immediately puts a hold on her own feelings.. Miki is extremely loyal to her friends and will do anything to help them. She meddles constantly in their affairs and can be quite incessant in forcing them to confront their feelings. When asked what is most important to her in life, her answer was simply, \\"Friends!\\"Kouji Seo (Sept 16 2005). \\"Character #3, Hashiba Miki\\", Suzuka Guide Book, Yu Kemuri Renai Hakusho ÊπØ„Åë„ÇÄ„ÇäÊÅãÊÑõÁôΩÊõ∏, original Japanese language version, Kodansha, pp. 155‚Äì71. : The surname is derived from one of the old surnames of warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Girls' dormitoryAyano Fujikawa= : * :Yamato's aunt, who is the landlady of the women‚Äôs dormitory and public bathhouse. She lets Yamato stay rent-free and pays him for cleaning. She seems to be close with her tenants and is even proud of their accomplishments. She often cooks meals for her nephew and Suzuka. Yamato's mother revealed that her marriage was an elopement. Even though her husband is deceased,. she continues to wear her wedding band. =Miho Fujikawa= : * :Ayano's daughter and Yamato‚Äôs younger cousin by two years. She is very attached and protective of Yamato to the point of being jealous of Suzuka. Occasionally, she reminds Yamato of his childhood promise to marry her to cheer him up or as a joke. During the time skip, she became a high school student, moved into Suzuka's old room, and became the track manager. When Suzuka moved back to the apartments, she was forced to give up her room and move back in with her mother. =Yuka Saotome= : * :A boisterous busybody college student from rural Akita that lives in Ayano‚Äôs dormitory. She likes to drink and usually ends up in Yamato‚Äôs room with her best friend Megumi. She has been known to take pictures of Yamato in compromising positions so she can blackmail him later. Even though she considers her relationship with Yamato to be ‚Äúmaster and slave‚Äù,. she often tries to help him with his relationship problems and has admitted that she worries about him. He also seems to be one of the few people she can be vulnerable with. In fact, Yamato is the only one that she has told about her one sided love for Sasaoka, who she has liked since high school. She had confessed to him fifteen times, but Sasaoka took it as a joke because she never seriously followed through. These rejections had a profound impact on her life, driving her to change her appearance and her dating behavior. Before Sasaoka left for the United States, Yamato took her to the airport so she could finally convince him of her feelings. Even though she finally got through to him, he revealed he is already engaged to be married next year. She took this rejection well, claiming that she felt refreshed and not as devastated as she originally thought. After thanking Yamato, she proclaimed she will become a better woman and find an even better man. She has since returned her appearance to the way it was when Yamato first met her. : The character name is likely a nod to Japanese voice actress Yuka Saotome. =Megumi Matsumoto= : * :A soft-spoken, bespectacled college student who also lives in Ayano‚Äôs dormitory. She is often seen trying to reign in Yuka when she is drunk. Ironically, Megumi gets drunk easily, and in that state is even wilder than Yuka, often berating Yamato on how all men are perverts, accusing Yamato of staring at her chest, flashing him her naked breasts for no reason, and then slapping him for looking. She has expressed the desire to become married.. : The character name is likely a nod to Japanese voice actress Megumi Matsumoto. Track AthletesKazuki Tsuda= : * :When Suzuka and S≈çichi were in middle school, Kazuki was their track captain, and was ranked first in the 100 meter. The similarities between him and Yamato are a striking resemblance in terms of looks, personality, and running talent. During track practices, he and Suzuka would often fight because she wanted practices to be serious and he wanted them to be fun. Before the national tournament, he confessed to her and told her not to answer until he had won. On the day of the tournament, when running home to get his spikes that he forgot, he was hit and killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. His death has since weighed heavily on Suzuka, since she never confessed to him that she reciprocated his feelings for her. : The character surname is likely derived from Japanese baseball player Tsunemi Tsuda of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. =Tetsuhito Kinugasa= : * :The track captain when Yamato first joined the team. He competes in shot put and is often seen putting Yamato in a headlock or making him do extra training. His name (Tetsuhito) literally means \\"Iron man\\". He has high expectations for Yamato, so much that during actual tournaments he will not watch Yamato run and often resorts to hiding behind a tree. Even though he has graduated and is now attending Seij≈ç University, he still comes to check on the high school track team. After learning that Yamato and Suzuka got recommendations for Seij≈ç, he offered to show Yamato and Suzuka around the campus. He was personally training Yamato before the start of the academic term, until Yamato decided enter the workforce instead of attending the University. Tetsuhito expressed his disappointment that Yamato did not confide his problems with him. He also made sure that Yamato understood the consequence of his and Suzuka's decision to drop out, since that would mean that Seij≈ç University would probably no longer take members of their high school any more for selections. After seeing Yamato and Suzuka apologizing to the high school track club, he expresses support for their choice. : The character name is derived from Japanese baseball player Sachio Kinugasa of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, whose nickname was Tetsujin (ÈâÑ‰∫∫, lit. Man of Steel) itself derived from Tetsujin 28-go. =Soichi Miyamoto= : * :One of the members of the track team and captain after Kinugasa graduates. A classmate of Suzuka's from junior high school. After hearing about Yamato's performance in physical tests, he actively persuades Yamato to join the track team. When Yamato came to him to help with making better times, he analyzed that data, found that Yamato was reaching his top speed too early, and made a training regimen for him. He believes Yamato has the potential to surpass Kazuki's skill. Before graduating, he chose Yamato to become the next track captain. He is currently part of T≈çto University's track team and was influential in Yamato getting his recommendation. Even though Yamato eventually chose to attend Seij≈ç, he still wanted him to perform his best. : The character name is derived from legendary Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. =Arima Emerson= : * :He is Yamato's main track rival, who is ranked first nationally in the 100 meter sprint. He initially went to T≈çto University High School. During junior high school, he was always beaten by Kazuki, which is still a touchy subject for him. Like Suzuka, he took up the offer to study abroad in United States, during which he stayed informed about Yamato's running times back in Japan. Afterward, he decided to go T≈çto University and run for their track team. He indirectly helped Yamato realize that Suzuka and their unborn child was more important to him than track which led to Yamato's decision to not attend University and become employed to support his family. Near the end of the series, he still expresses hopes that he will have a chance to compete with Yamato in the Olympics. He went on to represent Japan in the 100m sprint. : The character name is derived from Brazilian striker Emerson who played for the Urawa Red Diamonds and the Arima clan of Feudal Japan. =Kenji Kobayakawa= : * :A hard working sprinter of the track team who was on an athletic scholarship. Even though he is a talented sprinter, he is not as fast as Yamato in the 100 meters. He dislikes Yamato because he outperforms him in track and Honoka, the girl he liked, had only had eyes for Yamato. Like Yamato, he was scouted by the universities in his senior year at high school. When Yamato and Suzuka told the high school track club that they dropped out of Seij≈ç University, he was the only member that was upset about their decision. A running joke through the series is that he is often forgotten about by the other characters. He went on to represent Japan in the 200m race. : The character name is derived from Japanese baseball player Takehiko Kobayakawa of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. =Tsuyoshi Kusakabe= : :He is one of classmates of Miho's. He has liked Miho for a long time, but has had little success with winning her affections. During his first year in high school, he joined the track team and it's implied that he hung around Miho, who's usually with Yamato, as much as possible. On the track team, he became arrogant when he was not under Yamato's supervision. This caused Yamato to treat Tsuyoshi in a similar fashion as Kinugasa treated Yamato. With support from Miho and Suzuka and with Yamato's guidance, he was able to take first place at the rookie track meet. : The character surname is likely derived from the Kusakabe clan of Feudal Japan. Other charactersNana Shirakawa= * :A popular singing idol who has been Honoka‚Äôs mentor. Most are surprised to discover this because it is unexpected that someone as timid as Honoka would have such glamorous acquaintances. Even though Nana's famous, she considers Honoka to be her only friend because she treats her normally. Because of this she is very protective of her. : The character surname is likely derived from Japanese idol Yukina Shirakawa. =Suzune Asahina= : * Voiced by\\" Mina Tominaga (Japanese), Laura Bailey (English) :Suzuka's older sister by one year. According to her younger sister, Suzune is slightly dim- witted. Early in the series, every time she meets Yamato, she has the family dog \\"Muku\\" attack him. She is the only character that has an easy time reading Suzuka's thoughts. She shows up later on when Yamato walks home Suzuka from a date. She was apparently very amused when Yamato first met her parents and reveals later that unlike Yamato, her own boyfriend was not allowed into their house by her stern father because he failed to greet Mr. Asahina properly. =Yui Amami= : :One of the girls in the group date that Yasunobu tricked Yamato into going on. She took a liking to him and her feelings only grew when Yamato began working at her family's cafe, which was the only place of employment that Yamato could find that allowed him to work one day a week. After Yamato and Suzuka broke up, she visited Yamato to try and cheer him up. Seeing the state he was in, she tried to comfort him both physically and emotionally, but found that he did not reciprocate her feelings. She was later on invited by Yasunobu to celebrate Yamato and Suzuka's marriage held by their friends, which made Yamato nervous until Yasunobu reassured him that she was not the type to hang on forever. Later on she was in attendance at their wedding ceremony. Yui and her father made cameos in chapter 90 and 225 of A Town Where You Live. :The character name is likely derived from Japanese actress Y≈´ki Amami. =Hiroshi Sasaoka= : :A salesman for the sports equipment company ‚ÄúAdriex‚Äù. One of his jobs is to recruit Japan‚Äôs top student athletes to study abroad and train in the United States, for which all expenses are paid by his company. He was also Yuka‚Äôs crush from high school, but, much to her displeasure, he still treated her like a younger sister. Before transferring him back to the United States for the next 5 to 6 years, Yuka finally convinces him of her feelings for him. He told her that a relationship was not possible because he was already engaged to be married next year. Later on, he comes back to Japan to make wedding preparations, during which he was contacted by Suzuka about any employment opportunities for Yamato. He said there was an opening in an affiliate company and he would be willing to give Yamato a recommendation, which led to Yamato getting employed by a company that has a track team. : The character surname is derived from Japanese baseball player Shinji Sasaoka of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. =Saki Asai= : :Yamato's childhood friend from Hiroshima, who is also the same girl from his original firefly confession. She stayed at Ayano's dormitory for about a week while she toured Touto University, where she wanted to study fashion. She learned that Yamato was recommended to Touto, which she had made him pinky swear they would attend together. During her stay, she showed interest in her childhood friend, but her advances were mistaken by Yamato for her playful nature. After she realized that Yamato was still in love with then ex-girlfriend Suzuka, she released him from the promise before she returned home. Later on she is seen attending Yamato and Suzuka's wedding ceremony. : The character surname is derived from Japanese baseball player Itsuki Asai of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. =F≈´ka Akitsuki= : :Yamato and Suzuka's daughter. She stars as a protagonist in K≈çji Seo's new manga series Fuuka. She closely resembles her mother but has a combination of both of her parents' personalities. She is short-tempered like her mother but is more carefree like her father, and is able to make friends with everyone around her. While she is skilled in track and field, she doesn't share her parents' love for sports and is more interested in music. When she enters in high school, she meets the male protagonist, Yuu, whom she initially thinks is perverted due to an embarrassing encounter from their first meeting. However, she later befriends him and falls in love with him. :However, shortly after starting a music band with various classmates and confessing her love to Yuu, Fuuka is struck and killed by a truck as she was rushing to meet with Yuu and the band for a concert. Her death sends Yuu into a deep depression due to that they had just starting dating and her presence had a profound effect on him. But her death inspires him to continue her goal in becoming a famous band with their friends, and they name band \\"Fallen Moon\\", which was her suggestion prior to her death.

It is part of the Ridgefield School District. It was ranked 119th in Newsweek's 2015 list of the top 1,600 high schools in America and 226th in U.S. News & World Report's 2012 list of the top 4,813 high schools.  Academics  The school's dropout rate has remained consistent over the years at 1%. Daily attendance has been similarly steady at 95%.  Course Offerings  341 students took 754 Advanced Placement (AP) exams in May 2006, with 92.2 percent of exams with scores of 3 or higher. In the eight years up through the 2005-2006 school year, the number of students taking AP exams has tripled. Ridgefield High School offers 20 AP classes, as well as multiple UConn Early College Experience classes and Multi-Variable Calculus (as an honors course, not dual enrollment). In 2012, a number of computer-related subjects were added to the curriculum, including computer art, computer music, engineering (Project Lead the Way), digital design studio, and Advanced Placement Computer Science. However, the latter is only available in alternating years.  District Reference Group A  For the purpose of comparison with the achievement levels of similar schools, the state Department of Education classifies schools and communities in \\"District Reference Groups\\", defined as \\"districts whose students' families are similar in education, income, occupation and need, and that have roughly similar enrollment\\". Ridgefield is one of eight school districts in District Reference Group A (grouped with Darien, Easton, New Canaan, Redding, Weston, Westport, and Wilton).  Student Achievement  Students and alumni of Ridgefield High School have won many prestigious academic honors. RHS regularly produces 8-12 National Merit Scholarship Finalists annually, though the class of 2019 was a notable exception to this trend. Graduates of Ridgefield High School have won full rides to colleges such as Duke University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Michigan. RHS students have also been named Presidential Scholars, a Coca-Cola Scholar, a Lieberman Scholar, a Jefferson Scholar, Stamps Scholars, Morks Family Scholars, A. B. Scholars, and more. The school has also produced multiple student representatives to the Connecticut State Board of Education.  Athletics  About 65% of the student body participates in at least one interscholastic athletic activity. It is a member of the Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference and is in class LL for states. Each year RHS sends many students to play a variety of sports at the collegiate level. In 2019, Ridgefield High School added fencing to its list of sports, on the club level.  Facilities  The school's facilities include a two-story-high, glass-enclosed student center and all marble Student Life Office. The school has a football stadium with turf field and a turf practice field adjacent to that (Tiger Hollow 1 and 2).  Controversies  Over the years, but especially so in the past few, Ridgefield High School has attracted its fair share of controversy.  Student Racism  In October 2017, a video of a Ridgefield High School student along with a then-recent alum painted in blackface with the headline \\"Nigger\\" went viral on social media. The post was shared hundreds of times, and deeply upset some students of color who pointed out that \\"Ridgefield as a town is 96% white.\\" There was also additional controversy regarding the administration's decision to discipline student reporters who shared the information prior to extensive fact-checking, leading to the spread of some misinformation regarding the administration's training of faculty members.  Baseball Field Fire  A wet baseball field was doused with 24 gallons of gasoline and set on fire in a failed attempt to dry the field for a Ridgefield High School varsity baseball game in April 2019. Three RHS varsity baseball coaches were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a police investigation. The cost to restore the field to pre-fire condition was estimated to be in excess of $50,000.  Hazing  In 2014, a series of hazing events left many underclassmen students intoxicated as they attended class. The breadth of students that were affected by this event garnered much media coverage, with the bulk of the students being involved with athletic teams at the school. The hazing occurred as part of the school's Homecoming Spirit Week. In 2019, the school took steps to prevent hazing among its athletic teams.  Swastikas  During the 2017-2018 academic year, there were no fewer than 5 instances of swastikas drawn on or around school grounds. On September 8, 2017, an anti- Semitic symbol was found etched into a table at Ridgefield High School. A little more than 2 months later, on Tuesday, November 21, a swastika was found drawn on the inside of a classroom door at Ridgefield High School. Additional anti-Semitic symbols were found in January, June, and August. All these events led to the creation of a program for town officials to \\"do more than condemn\\" the events.  Threats of Violence  In the 2018-2019 academic year, Ridgefield High School saw a surge in threats of violence against staff and students. In late May 2019, a student was arrested for threatening to initiate a school shooting. The student, whose name was not released because he or she is a minor, was charged with threatening in the first degree and breach of peace in the second degree. Earlier that year, there were instances of bomb threats in December and January. There was also an undisclosed threat made on social media in March of the same academic year.

Calinger (born January 2, 1940) is a former lawyer, former mayor of Omaha and education official. Political career Walter Calinger was a member of the Omaha City Council and served as the 45th mayor of Omaha, Nebraska from April 20, 1988 to June 5, 1989. He was appointed by the city council after the death of Mayor Bernie Simon. Prior to serving on the City Council and as Mayor of Omaha Calinger was a member and elected twice as president of the Omaha Broad of Education. Education career Calinger has a PhD in Education from The Ohio State University (1970) and a J.D. from Creighton University (1977). He has worked the large majority of his career in the education sector beginning as a math teacher and guidance counselor. He was employed by the Norton City School District in Summit County, Ohio, from 1998‚Äì2005, where he was superintendent from 2002‚Äì2005. While there, the district achieved an Excellent rating in 2003 from the Ohio Department of Education for the first time ever. It has retained that rating since. Calinger worked for the Richmond Heights (Ohio) School District from 2005‚Äì2008. In his first year, the district improved five points on the Ohio Achievement Test. And the following year improved one more point. During that time, the RHEA entered into a teachers' strike that lasted for four weeks. When Walter Calinger was hired by Woodland Hills School District outside Pittsburgh, his claims of past accomplishment was discussed by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reporter Brian Bowling. The article begins, \\"The new superintendent for Woodland Hills School District says he significantly raised test scores and closed the achievement gap between black and white students at a suburban Cleveland district.\\" In his position as superintendent (2008‚Äì2011) of the Woodland Hills School District, Calinger challenged the public charter school Propel, about how the School District's test results compared with the Propel charter school. His statement was disputed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette education reporter Eleanor Chute,: Calinger strongly denied the accuracy of the Chute statement. \\"She did not at all deal with the requirement of the law setting up charter schools. It was that law and the charter schools failure to meet its requirements that Calinger was challenging.\\" Calinger continued to make public statements about school data in an op-ed he published in the Post- Gazette in October, 2010. Law career Calinger was a practicing lawyer in Nebraska until his law license was suspended by the Nebraska Supreme Court on December 1, 1995. According to the ruling, Calinger neglected his duties in a worker's compensation case, resulting in the client losing the case, but, in fact, Calinger had, with the Defendant's approval, transferred her case to her present attorney and his partner, some three months before the critical date, when he ceased full-time practice and became Mayor of Omaha. They did not properly enter the case. The original client had obtained a default judgment in her suit against Calinger while he was in Chile and thus he could not assert several valid defenses. She did not serve the claim. Calinger, as Plaintiff, brought an action to set aside the default judgement in the Iowa District Court for Montgomery County wherein the pleadings and testimony show that he was living openly in Santiago, Chile and was, in fact, contacted by TV reporters, newspaper reporters and other United States citizens including his parish priest from Omaha while he was living in Chile. At case No. EQCV019068 on June 8, 2004, the default judgement was set aside. The defendant appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court and the case was heard by the Iowa Court of Appeals which on August 23, 2006 at (No. 6-215/05-00421) affirmed the decision of the District Court.

These parameters are used to describe the electrical behavior of linear electrical networks. They are also used to describe the small-signal (linearized) response of non-linear networks. Y parameters are also known as short circuited admittance parameters. They are members of a family of similar parameters used in electronic engineering, other examples being: S-parameters,Pozar, David M. (2005); Microwave Engineering, Third Edition (Intl. Ed.); John Wiley & Sons; pp. 170-174. . Z-parameters,Pozar, David M. (2005) (op. cit); pp. 170-174. H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters.Pozar, David M. (2005) (op. cit); pp. 183-186.Morton, A. H. (1985); Advanced Electrical Engineering;Pitman Publishing Ltd.; pp. 33-72. The Y-parameter matrix A Y-parameter matrix describes the behaviour of any linear electrical network that can be regarded as a black box with a number of ports. A port in this context is a pair of electrical terminals carrying equal and opposite currents into and out of the network, and having a particular voltage between them. The Y-matrix gives no information about the behaviour of the network when the currents at any port are not balanced in this way (should this be possible), nor does it give any information about the voltage between terminals not belonging to the same port. Typically, it is intended that each external connection to the network is between the terminals of just one port, so that these limitations are appropriate. For a generic multi-port network definition, it is assumed that each of the ports is allocated an integer n ranging from 1 to N, where N is the total number of ports. For port n, the associated Y-parameter definition is in terms of the port voltage and port current, V_n\\\\, and I_n\\\\, respectively. For all ports the currents may be defined in terms of the Y-parameter matrix and the voltages by the following matrix equation: :I = Y V\\\\, where Y is an N √ó N matrix the elements of which can be indexed using conventional matrix notation. In general the elements of the Y-parameter matrix are complex numbers and functions of frequency. For a one-port network, the Y-matrix reduces to a single element, being the ordinary admittance measured between the two terminals. Two-port networks Norton sources with voltage-controlled current sources. reciprocal two-port network. The Y-parameter matrix for the two-port network is probably the most common. In this case the relationship between the port voltages, port currents and the Y-parameter matrix is given by: :\\\\begin{pmatrix}I_1 \\\\ I_2\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} Y_{11} & Y_{12} \\\\ Y_{21} & Y_{22} \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}V_1 \\\\ V_2\\\\end{pmatrix}. where :Y_{11} = {I_1 \\\\over V_1 } \\\\bigg_{V_2 = 0} \\\\qquad Y_{12} = {I_1 \\\\over V_2 } \\\\bigg_{V_1 = 0} :Y_{21} = {I_2 \\\\over V_1 } \\\\bigg_{V_2 = 0} \\\\qquad Y_{22} = {I_2 \\\\over V_2 } \\\\bigg_{V_1 = 0} For the general case of an N-port network, :Y_{nm} = {I_n \\\\over V_m } \\\\bigg_{V_k = 0 \\\\text{ for } k e m} Admittance relations The input admittance of a two-port network is given by: :Y_{in} = Y_{11} - \\\\frac{Y_{12}Y_{21}}{Y_{22}+Y_L} where YL is the admittance of the load connected to port two. Similarly, the output admittance is given by: :Y_{out} = Y_{22} - \\\\frac{Y_{12}Y_{21}}{Y_{11}+Y_S} where YS is the admittance of the source connected to port one. Relation to S-parameters The Y-parameters of a network are related to its S-Parameters by : \\\\begin{align} Y &= \\\\sqrt{y} (1_{!N} - S) (1_{!N} + S)^{-1} \\\\sqrt{y} \\\\ &= \\\\sqrt{y} (1_{!N} + S)^{-1} (1_{!N} - S) \\\\sqrt{y} \\\\ \\\\end{align} and : \\\\begin{align} S &= (1_{!N} - \\\\sqrt{z}Y\\\\sqrt{z}) (1_{!N} + \\\\sqrt{z}Y\\\\sqrt{z})^{-1} \\\\ &= (1_{!N} + \\\\sqrt{z}Y\\\\sqrt{z})^{-1} (1_{!N} - \\\\sqrt{z}Y\\\\sqrt{z}) \\\\ \\\\end{align} where 1_{!N} is the identity matrix, \\\\sqrt{y} is a diagonal matrix having the square root of the characteristic admittance (the reciprocal of the characteristic impedance) at each port as its non-zero elements, \\\\sqrt{y} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\sqrt{y_{01}} & \\\\ & \\\\sqrt{y_{02}} \\\\ & & \\\\ddots \\\\ & & & \\\\sqrt{y_{0N}} \\\\end{pmatrix} and \\\\sqrt{z} = (\\\\sqrt{y})^{-1} is the corresponding diagonal matrix of square roots of characteristic impedances. In these expressions the matrices represented by the bracketed factors commute and so, as shown above, may be written in either order.Any square matrix commutes with itself and with the identity matrix, and if two matrices A and B commute, then so do A and B‚àí1 (since AB‚àí1 = B‚àí1BAB‚àí1 = B‚àí1ABB‚àí1 = B‚àí1A) Two port In the special case of a two-port network, with the same and real characteristic admittance y_{01} = y_{02} = Y_0 at each port, the above expressions reduce to :Y_{11} = {((1 - S_{11}) (1 + S_{22}) + S_{12} S_{21}) \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Y_0 \\\\, :Y_{12} = {-2 S_{12} \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Y_0 \\\\, :Y_{21} = {-2 S_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Y_0 \\\\, :Y_{22} = {((1 + S_{11}) (1 - S_{22}) + S_{12} S_{21}) \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Y_0 \\\\, Where :\\\\Delta_S = (1 + S_{11}) (1 + S_{22}) - S_{12} S_{21} \\\\, The above expressions will generally use complex numbers for S_{ij} and Y_{ij}. Note that the value of \\\\Delta can become 0 for specific values of S_{ij} so the division by \\\\Delta in the calculations of Y_{ij} may lead to a division by 0. The two-port S-parameters may also be obtained from the equivalent two-port Y-parameters by means of the following expressions.Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer, \\"Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics\\", Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons Inc.; 1993, pp. 537-541, . :S_{11} = {(1 - Z_0 Y_{11}) (1 + Z_0 Y_{22}) + Z^2_0 Y_{12} Y_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta} \\\\, :S_{12} = {-2 Z_0 Y_{12} \\\\over \\\\Delta} \\\\, :S_{21} = {-2 Z_0 Y_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta} \\\\, :S_{22} = {(1 + Z_0 Y_{11}) (1 - Z_0 Y_{22}) + Z^2_0 Y_{12} Y_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta} \\\\, where :\\\\Delta = (1 + Z_0 Y_{11}) (1 + Z_0 Y_{22}) - Z^2_0 Y_{12} Y_{21} \\\\, and Z_0 is the characteristic impedance at each port (assumed the same for the two ports). Relation to Z-parameters Conversion from Z-parameters to Y-parameters is much simpler, as the Y-parameter matrix is just the inverse of the Z-parameter matrix. The following expressions show the applicable relations: :Y_{11} = {Z_{22} \\\\over Z} \\\\, :Y_{12} = {-Z_{12} \\\\over Z} \\\\, :Y_{21} = {-Z_{21} \\\\over Z} \\\\, :Y_{22} = {Z_{11} \\\\over Z} \\\\, Where :Z = Z_{11} Z_{22} - Z_{12} Z_{21} \\\\, In this case Z is the determinant of the Z-parameter matrix. Vice versa the Y-parameters can be used to determine the Z-parameters, essentially using the same expressions since :Y = Z^{-1} \\\\, And :Z = Y^{-1} \\\\, NotesReferencesSee also *Nodal admittance matrix *Scattering parameters *Impedance parameters *Two-port network *Hybrid-pi model *Power gain Category:Two-port networks Category:Transfer functions de:Zweitor#Zweitorgleichungen_und_Parameter ","title":"Admittance parameters"},{"id":"10058506","text":"Simchah (Simon) ben Abraham Calimani (1699 ‚Äì August 2, 1784) was a Venetian rabbi and author.

According to human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the government of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter, food, freedom of movement and residence, freedom of assembly and the protection of the law. There are assaults on the media, the political opposition, civil society activists, and human rights defenders. Opposition gatherings are frequently the subject of brutal attacks by the police force, such as the crackdown on an 11 March 2007 Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) rally. In the events, party leader Morgan Tsvangirai and 49 other opposition activists were arrested and severely beaten by the police. Edward Chikombo, a journalist who sent images of the beatings to foreign media, was abducted and murdered a few days later.\\"Zimbabwe journalist murdered 'over leaked Tsvangirai pictures'\\", The Independent, 4 April 2007 After his release, Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC that he suffered head injuries and blows to the arms, knees and back, and that he lost a significant amount of blood. The police action was strongly condemned by the UN Secretary- General, Ban Ki-moon, the European Union and the United States. While nothing that the activists had suffered injuries, but not mentioning the cause of them, the Zimbabwean government-controlled daily newspaper The Herald claimed the police had intervened after demonstrators \\"ran amok looting shops, destroying property, mugging civilians, and assaulting police officers and innocent members of the public\\". The newspaper also argued that the opposition had been \\"wilfully violating the ban on political rallies\\". Police repression There is a widespread consensus among human rights organisations that systematic violations of the right of personal freedom and integrity are frequent in Zimbabwe, especially towards suspected members of the political opposition. The violations are perpetrated by government supporters as well as law enforcement agencies, and include assaults, torture, death threats, kidnappings and unlawful arrests and detentions. In 1999, three Americans ‚Äì John Dixon, Gary Blanchard and Joseph Pettijohn ‚Äì claimed to have been tortured after their arrest. The trial judge accepted their evidence of torture and gave them lenient sentences after their conviction for weapons offences. In the same year, Robert Mugabe condemned judges at Zimbabwe's Supreme Court who asked him to comment on the illegal arrest and torture, by state security services, of two journalists, Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto. The law enforcement agencies are a major source of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe. According to Human Rights Watch there have been a growing number of cases in which police have assaulted and tortured opposition supporters and civil society activists. One notable case was the arrest and subsequent beatings of a group of trade union activists, including the president and secretary general of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions,Emergency Resolution on Zimbabwe of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union at Matapi police station, following peaceful protests on 13 September 2006. The unionists were initially denied medical and juridical assistance. Another similar case was the arrest of student activist leader Promise Mkwanazi on 29 May 2006. Mkwanazi was detained at a police station in Bindura for five days without charge. During that time he was repeatedly stripped, shackled and beaten with batons by policemen, who accused him of trying to overthrow the government. He had been the subject of constant police surveillance since 2000 due to his involvement in MDC party rallies and recruitment with assistance from fellow members and former student activists Tafadzwa Takawira and Tendai Ndira, who had also been victims of police brutality, torture and unlawful detention in cells which were of inhuman conditions and poor sanitary standards with non-flushing toilets and little air ventilation within the cells. From 2001 to September 2006 the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum has recorded over 1200 cases of human rights violations by the law enforcement agencies, including 363 cases of torture, 516 cases of assault, 58 cases of death threats, 399 cases of unlawful arrest and 451 cases of unlawful detention. Many of these incidents include multiple victims. The organisation finds that the law enforcement agencies are encouraged to perpetrate abuses by statements made by high-ranking members of the ruling party ZANU-PF. The United States Department of State reported in a Public Announcement dated 12 July 2007 that the situation in Zimbabwe is continuing to deteriorate as public protest against Mugabe and the ZANU-PF increases. Recent government price fixing on all local consumer goods has led to major shortages of basic necessities, leading to violence between desperate citizens and government forces seeking to enforce the restrictions and quell disruptions. The government has continued to reiterate its mandate to eliminate any dissent or opposition to its policies \\"by any means necessary\\", including lethal force. It has backed up this statement with random and indiscriminate acts of state- sponsored violence from various security forces on anyone perceived to be an opponent; these attacks often occur without provocation or warning as a form of state terrorism. Restricted civil liberties In Zimbabwe the freedom of assembly is severely restricted by law. The legal framework is further stretched in practice, with law enforcement closely monitoring opposition demonstrations and public gatherings. There are many reports of the arrest and subsequent beating of demonstrators. According to the Human Rights Watch report \\"You Will Be Thoroughly Beaten\\": The Brutal Suppression of Dissent in Zimbabwe, laws such as the Public Order and Security Act (POSA) and the Miscellaneous Offences Act (MOA) are used to violently disrupt peaceful demonstrations and justify the arrest of civil society activists. In some cases, the activists are held for more than the legally allowed limit, often without charge. In its 2006 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House finds that Zimbabwe's already very poor freedom of expression and freedom of the press has deteriorated still further. The 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) requires journalists and media companies to register with the government-controlled Media and Information Commission (MIC) and gives the government powers to deny people to work as journalists. An amendment enacted in 2005 introduced prison sentences of up to two years for journalists working without accreditation. Oppositional and independent newspapers have been ordered to close by the authorities, and journalists are intimidated, arrested, and prosecuted, with the support of laws criminalising the publication of \\"inaccurate\\" information. Foreign journalists are regularly denied visas, and local correspondents for foreign publications have been refused accreditation and threatened with deportation. The state controls all broadcast media as well as major dailies such as The Chronicle and The Herald. The coverage is dominated by favourable portrayals of Robert Mugabe and the ZANU-PF party and attacks on government critics. According to Freedom House, the government also monitors e-mail content. According to the US State Department, a local NGO has quoted State Security Minister Didymus Mutasa as stating the authorities would \\"not relent in their determination to hound into extinction the country's few remaining alternative sources of information.\\" While some African election observers deemed the 2005 parliamentary election reflective of the will of the people, the general consensus is that these and prior elections in Zimbabwe have not been free and fair, with widespread electoral fraud. Candidates and supporters of the opposition party, MDC, have been restricted from campaigning openly in some areas, and have faced harassment, violence and intimidation. Government food stocks have been offered to voters in exchange for their votes. The media coverage has been strongly biased in favour of ZANU-PF. On election day, many potential voters, particularly in constituencies dominated by the opposition, were turned away. The main reason for this was that they tried to vote in the wrong constituency due to inadequately publicised redistricting. Election observers also noted voter intimidation at polling stations. In one incident, police took no action when a ZANU-PF candidate threatened to shoot MDC polling agents. Vote reporting discrepancies heavily favouring the ruling party suggest that tolls were manipulated.  Aftermath of the 2007 Zimbabwean alleged coup d'√©tat attempt  The Zimbabwean government claimed to have foiled an alleged coup in May 2007. According to the government, the soldiers planned on forcibly removing President Robert Mugabe from office and asking Rural Housing Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa to form a government with the heads of the armed forces. Several men, either on active duty or retired from the Zimbabwe National Army, were arrested and charged with treason between May 29 and early June 2007. Further arrests took place, as well as executions. The executions were strongly condemned by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, the European Union and the United States and also the then shadow foreign security David Miliband. Discrimination Women are disadvantaged in Zimbabwe, with economic dependency and social norms preventing them from combating sex discrimination. Despite legal prohibitions, customs such as forced marriage are still in place. Domestic violence against women is a serious problem. While labour legislation prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace, such harassment is common and generally not prosecuted. While the law recognises women's right to property, inheritance and divorce, many women lack awareness of their rights. President Mugabe has criticised homosexuals, attributing Africa's ills to them. Common law prevents homosexual men, and to a lesser extent homosexual women, from fully expressing their sexual orientation. In some cases it also criminalises the display of affection between men. The criminal code has been amended to define sodomy to include \\"any act involving physical contact between males that would be regarded by a reasonable person to be an indecent act.\\" Escalating violence during the 2008 national elections In 2008, parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The Opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), led by Morgan Tsvangirai, won both the parliamentary election and the first round of the presidential, sparking a run-off in a latter. The three-month campaign between the first and second rounds of the presidential election was marred by increasing violence targeted at MDC supporters. The MDC stated that at least 86 of its supporters -including Gibson Nyandoro and Tonderai Ndira- had been murdered, and that 200,000 others had been forced out of their homes by pro-government militia.\\"UN 'regrets' Zimbabwe election\\", BBC, 28 June 2008 The election itself was reportedly marked by mass intimidation, with citizens being forced to vote, and required to show their ballot to government party representatives before placing it in the ballot box.\\"Simulacre d'√©lection au Zimbabwe, l'opposition appelle le monde √† la rejeter√©\\" , AFP, 28 June 2008 Torture  It was alleged that Zimbabwe's security forces had a torture camp in the Marange diamond fields; methods include severe beatings, sexual assault and dog mauling. On 8 June 2020, the Amnesty International reported torture and sexual assault of three opposition activists and members of parliament, Joana Mamombe, Cecilia Chimbiri and Netsai Marova. They were arrested and forcibly disappeared on 13 May in Zimbabwe‚Äôs capital, Harare, for leading an anti- government protest over the authorities‚Äô response to the coronavirus pandemic and far-reaching hunger in the country. After two days they were found in a miserable state in Bindura, 87km from Harare. On 26 May, the activists were charged by police for gathering with intent to promote public violence and breach of peace. Crimes against Humanity  There has been widespread reports of egregious crimes against humanity by the Mugabe government between 1980 and 2017. Writing for the Human Rights Quarterly, Rhoda E. Howard- Hassmann claimed that there was \\"clear evidence that Mugabe was guilty of crimes against humanity\\".Howard-Hassmann 2010, p. 909 In 2009, Gregory Stanton, then President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and Helen Fein, then Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of Genocide, published a letter in The New York Times stating that there was sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity to bring Mugabe to trial in front of the International Criminal Court.c Howard-Hassmann 2010, p. 917. Many human rights groups have criticised Western countries of turning a blind eye of the deliberate killing of at least 20,000 people, mostly Ndebele civilians, who were killed by Mugabe's Fifth Brigade between 1982 and 1985 during land seizures. Some scholars and activists believe the true figure could be 80,000.http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-17562-Gukurahundi+killed+80,000.../news.aspx The Mugabe administration has also been criticized by political opponents and groups like Amnesty International for the human rights abuses carried out by the country's security services. A massacre took place in Chikurubi Prison in Harare, on June 29, 1996, where Human Rights Watch estimated that more than 1,200 prisoners were shot and killed in just a matter of hours. In 2006, Amnesty International called for an independent inquiry into the deaths that occurred in Harare maximum security prison during the June 1996 massacre. From 1980‚Äì2017, according to some human rights groups the Mugabe government had been estimated to have been directly or indirectly responsible for the death of between 3 and 6 million Zimbabweans, although some sources differ, one human rights group says hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans have died due to starvation and famine as a result of his policies and actions, there has also been state killings where hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans have also believed to have died, so directly or indirectly, Mugabe could have been responsible for at least a million deaths. On July 24, 2020, Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights raised concerns over arrests of a prominent investigative journalist and an opposition leader citing that Zimbabwe authorities should not use coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to clamp down on fundamental freedoms. On August 5, 2020, the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter campaign drew attention of international celebrities and politicians towards human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, mounting pressure on Emmerson Mnanagwa‚Äôs government. The campaign came after arrests, abductions and torture of high- profile political activists and the incarceration of the journalist, Hopewell Chin‚Äôono, and the Booker prize long-listed author, Tsitsi Dangarembga. On 24 August 2020, Catholic bishops raised their voice for first time on human rights abuses in support of #Zimbabweanlivesmatter. Under the Pastoral Letter of the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops, they criticized President Emmerson Mnangagwa for corruption and abuse of power. Government response The government of Zimbabwe has generally responded to accusations of human rights violations from Western countries by counter-accusals of colonial attitudes and hypocrisy, claiming that countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are guilty of similar or worse transgressions, for example in the Iraq War. In a speech at the inaugural session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 21 June 2006 Zimbabwe's Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Patrick Chinamasa, assured that Zimbabwe would \\"respect the human rights of all its people\\". However, he accused \\"developed countries\\" of funding local NGOs with the goal of \\"undermining our sovereignty, creating and sustaining local opposition groups that have no local support base, and promoting disaffection and hostility among the local population against their popularly elected government\\".

Career Born in Sheffield, Ward started his career at his local club Sheffield United after graduating through the youth ranks. He was promoted to the first team alongside his best friend in professional football, left-winger Dane Whitehouse, who also enjoyed a consistent run in the first eleven. Despite Ward's versatility he initially had a struggle on his hands to hold down a starting place each week and it was due to this fact that he continued to served his apprenticeship on loan with Dario Gradi's Crewe Alexandra. Ward played 7 times for Crewe Alexandra scoring once in the league and grabbing another in the Football League Cup. Ward returned to United full of confidence but was frustrated by former Blades manager Dave Bassett's rotation policy, following a match with Watford in the First Division Ward scored twice yet still found himself on the bench for the following game. It could be argued that Ward's inability to keep his place was not due to his form, more due to his versatility, something that would be as much a burden for Ward as it would a strength, indeed throughout 7 years Ward had played in every area except goal. But for much of his time, when he was in the side, Ward could be found roaming his favoured position, the right-wing before then Blades manager Howard Kendall (who had replaced Bassett in December 1995) converted the versatile pro into an all action full-back, it was in this position that Ward played arguably his best football. During this time Ward became known as a lethal penalty taker with a composure not often seen in a utility player. He spent 8 years in total with Sheff Utd before being sold to Howard Kendall's Everton for ¬£750,000 on 25 November 1997. Kendall had returned to the Toffees after missing out on promotion with the Blades and raided his former club not only for Ward but for United's then record signing Don Hutchison and journeyman centre-back Carl Tiler. Ward's life in Liverpool was not so great, he got off to a bad start as he was on the losing side against Chelsea conceding a penalty in a 2‚Äì0 defeat only a day after signing. Following this nightmare start Ward toiled hard to make an impression in a lacklustre Everton side. But he only had a run of four games before picking up a hamstring injury. An unproductive come-back in February 1998 consisted of only another four matches before he finally succumbed to what was diagnosed as bad ankle ligament damage, however it would be another two months before the true problem was revealed, a fracture of the ankle. Ward would not appear for the Toffees again until October 1998, by this time Howard Kendall had been replaced with former Rangers manager Walter Smith. Smith decided to bring Ward back into the cauldron of the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, Ward did not let him down, showing glimpses of a return to his previous excellent Sheff United form. Ward's reward was the Captain's armband the following season in an ill-fated Football League Cup tie against Oxford. Again injury was to keep Ward out for much of 1999‚Äì2000 season and it was no surprise when his name was linked with a return to Bramall Lane. Overall, he made less than 30 appearances in a three-year span, never finding the back of the net and with a quarter of them coming from the subs bench, his final game was an away match with Leeds United on 8 May 2000. He was eventually sold at the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season to Barnsley for ¬£200,000. Ward enjoyed his return to his Yorkshire roots and found a new lease of life in more central role, operating primarily in defensive midfield ironically under the tutelage of former manager Dave Bassett. Ward spent 3 years at Oakwell, a vital first team player before being released on a free and joining the youngest manager in the League, Chris Brass at York City. Ward was a popular player at Bootham Crescent, however he left before the end of his first and only season with the Minstermen over a contract dispute. Ward played out his professional career with non-league outfit Altrincham whom he joined in 2004.

Lance Mackey disqualified from 2020 Iditarod Idatarod, May 7, 2020  Personal life  Lance's father, Dick Mackey, was one of the founders of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and won the event by one second over Rick Swenson in 1978. Lance's half-brother Rick Mackey also won the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1983. All three of them won the race on their sixth attempt wearing bib number 13. Mackey was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2001 but continued sled dog racing entering the 2002 Iditarod race. After scratching from that race, he took a full year off from racing to recover from the disease. He is now considered cancer-free; however, Mackey suffered nerve damage in his left index finger as a result of the operation to remove the cancerous tumor. The nerve damage caused such unbearable pain in the finger that Mackey chose to have the finger surgically removed. The radiation from the treatments also destroyed his saliva glands, causing his teeth to disintegrate. He has had the infected teeth pulled, and is currently having his teeth rebuilt by dentists.  Awards and honors  Asteroid 43793 Mackey, discovered by Carolyn Shoemaker and David H. Levy at Palomar Observatory in 1990, was named in his honor. Mackey was the subject of a 2015 independent feature-length documentary film called The Great Alone.

United Cigar Stores was a chain of cigar stores in the United States that in its first quarter-century grew to nearly 3,000 shops. It eventually became part of the corporation that bought Marvel Comics and its parent company Magazine Management from their founder in 1968. History Brothers Charles A. Whelan and George J. Whelan founded a tobacco wholesale firm in Syracuse, New York, in 1901, eventually turning to retail. By 1926, the chain had nearly 3,000 stores. Though initially specializing in cigars, it eventually sold many other items, such as Mickey Mouse watches and shoe trees. The chain represented the interests of the Consolidated Tobacco Company, the tobacco trust that controlled the American Tobacco Company and others. In September 1903 a settlement was reached with the chain's competitors and all competition ended. In August 1929, the chain and the affiliated Whelan Drug chain, founded by two of Charles' Whelan's sons, was sold to brothers George Kenan and Frederick Kenan Morrow. The company also was involved in real estate. As the Great Depression deepened, the real-estate subsidiary accumulated huge losses, so in September 1932 the holding company declared bankruptcy. Before its bankruptcy, it had 975 cigar stores and 219 drug stores, but most of its assets were in real estate. The chain recovered and had 1300 outlets in 1951. Corporate progression United Cigar Stores became part of United Cigar-Whelan Stores Corp., then United Whelan Corp. In 1962, it and three other companies merged to form Perfect Film & Chemical Corp., a film-processing and mail-order seller of drugs and vitamins. In 1968, it bought out publisher Martin Goodman, founder and owner of Magazine Management Company, the parent of Marvel Comics and other ventures. The Company renamed itself Cadence Industries Corporation in 1970, and was liquidated in 1986, selling its Marvel Entertainment Group to New World Pictures.

By winning championships and completing bonus rounds (unlocked by five yellow icons during a race but first two-day tracks), players can unlock them which they can use to either upgrade their boat or unlock a higher-powered one. Gameplay Rapid Racer was one of the first PlayStation games to take full advantage of the DualShock controller; the game allow steering with the analog sticks, and the gamepad vibrates during gameplay. The intensity of the vibrations depends on what type of water the player is in; calm rapids mean low vibrations, while heavier rapids give high vibrations. After reaching a certain point in the game, players can unlock the Fractal Generator. This feature allows the player to select from a large number of tracks besides the normal six. Players can either allow the generator to randomly select a track or manually input their own. Development Work on Rapid Racer began in 1995. Six months were spent modeling the physics and behavior of the water. The European version of the game runs at 50 frames per second, while the North American version runs at 60 frames per second. The game's soundtrack was composed by Apollo Four Forty (Loudmouth in Turbo Prop Racing). The game's main theme \\"Carrera Rapida\\" by Apollo 440 was released as a single and on their 1997 album Electro Glide in Blue. Reception Rapid Racer received mixed reviews from critics. GameSpot criticized the courses for being very narrow and limited, but praised the game's \\"hip-hop/techno\\" music, comparing it favorably to that of Wipeout. Edge highlighted the fluid graphics and frame rate, but criticized the unoriginal gameplay and unrealistic boat handling, which can frustrate players. The magazine concluded: \\"As a technological showcase, Rapid Racer is a truly impressive achievement. As a game in its own right, however, it falls disappointingly short of the expectations aroused by its glorious visuals.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Anyone who thinks that PlayStation is finished should check this game out.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1997 video games Category:Naval video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Racing video games Category:Racing video games set in the United States Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in Africa Category:Video games set in Canada Category:Video games set in Miami Category:Water sports video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Rapid Racer"},{"id":"10058679","text":"John Andrew Leslie (born 2 August 1940) is a Canadian philosopher.

Francis Collins references this parable in his book The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief as part of his argument that the Anthropic Principle strongly suggests a Creator with intent.

It is native to Mexico, the West Indies, northern South America, Central America and possibly tropical Florida.Gossypium hirsutum L. wild cotton, U.S. Forest Service Archeological evidence from the Tehuacan Valley in Mexico shows the cultivation of this species as long ago as 3,500 BC, although there is as yet no evidence as to exactly where it may have been first domesticated. This is the earliest evidence of cotton cultivation in the Americas found thus far. Gossypium hirsutum includes a number of varieties or cross-bred cultivars with varying fiber lengths and tolerances to a number of growing conditions. The longer length varieties are called \\"long staple upland\\" and the shorter length varieties are referred to as \\"short staple upland\\".

The Spoon (, Kochli√°rion; Slavonic: –õ–∂–∏—Ü–∞, Lzh√≠tza) in Eastern Christianity is a liturgical implement used to distribute Holy Communion to the laity during the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite. It is also called a cochlear, Latin for \\"spoon\\". In Western Christianity (within traditions such as Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and Methodism) a perforated spoon is used to remove any foreign particulate matter that falls into the wine. It is one of the items, in Western Christian Churches, that lies on the credence table. Purpose In the Early Church everyone, clergy and laity alike, received Holy Communion in the same manner: receiving the consecrated Body of Christ (in the form of bread) in their hands and then placing it in their own mouth, and sipping directly from the chalice. In time, concern over the danger of crumbs being accidentally dropped on the floor or some of the consecrated Blood of Christ (in the form of wine) being spilt, lead to the use of tongs, with which the elements were mingled together and placed carefully into the mouths of the communicants. By the 9th century, the Church began to use the Communion spoon for the same practical reasons, and it is this practice that remains in place today (though the clergy still receive in the ancient manner as they stand at the Holy Table). Usage In the Byzantine Rite, when it comes time for the Communion of the faithful, the Lamb (Host) is cut into smaller portions with the Spear and placed in the Chalice, and thus distributed to the faithful using the Spoon. In this way, the faithful receive both the Body and Blood of Christ, without taking the Sacrament into their hands. At the end of the Liturgy, the Deacon will use the Spoon to consume the remaining Gifts (Body and Blood of Christ), and then ablute the Spoon, Spear and Chalice using wine and hot water (the Diskos (Paten) is usually abluted only with hot water). Since the Spoon is one of the Sacred Vessels it is usually kept on the Table of Oblation (Prothesis), where the bread and wine are prepared for the Eucharist. Often when a Chalice and Diskos are made, an Asterisk, Spoon, and Spear will be made to match them. Because it touches the Body and Blood of Christ, the liturgical spoon should be made of gold, or at least be gold plated. The Spoon is also used to prepare the Presanctified Gifts at the Sunday Liturgies during Great Lent, and the Reserved Mysteries on Great Thursday of Holy Week. The priest will take up the Lamb in his left hand and hold it over the Chalice. With the Spoon in his right hand, he will pour some of the Blood of Christ onto the underside of the Lamb, where the cross had been cut with the Spear during the Proskomedie. The Spoon, being a sanctified object, may not be used for any purpose other than the liturgical uses for which it is appointed, and no one of lower rank than a deacon should touch it. The Maronite Catholic Church stands as an exception, as the faithful are given Communion by dipping a part of the consecrated loaf into the chalice, usually held by a deacon, and His Body, intincted with His Blood, is then placed in the communicants mouth by hand. The spoon is still often found as part of the ware of the altar, but is not normally used. This is also true for the Melkite Greek Catholic Church.

He is known within the industry for having helped originate what became known as the \\"Miami Sound\\", created out of a prominent independent record label of that era, TK Records. He used his innovative sound to create Paris International Records, his own independently owned label, which released multiple dance hits during the era. Early years Mart√≠nez was born in Cuba on October 9 to an American father and a Cuban mother. Although he and his family commuted between the United States and Cuba, Mart√≠nez permanently moved to Miami, Florida, at the age of ten. Having studied piano since the age of five, he graduated from Miami Dade Community College, and continued his higher education at Florida Atlantic University, majoring in Music and Business. He also pursued post-graduate courses. At the age of sixteen, Martinez first became involved with music by playing in local bands. In 1973, while playing at The Seven Seas Lounge, a popular Miami night club, he was asked to join the band, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. This is where Mart√≠nez received his first taste of fame, and started getting involved in the music industry on multiple levels, not just as a performer. Industry career In 1975, Mart√≠nez returned to Miami and went to work at T.K. Records, where he learned his craft from Henry Stone. Starting out as a studio musician, Martinez stayed after hours, watching and learning. He became a recording engineer, later advancing to chief engineer, eventually producing most of the artists at T.K. He went on to produce hits for several small and large music labels worldwide. Artistic career At T.K., Mart√≠nez experimented with his flair for \\"Afro- Cuban\\" percussion, and mixed it with the R & B sound that T.K. was famous for to originate the \\"Miami Sound\\". In 1978, he formed the studio group, Amant, which had disco hits with the tracks, \\"If There Is Love\\" and \\"Hazy Shades of Love\\". Both tracks peaked at number five on the disco chart. As an engineer/producer/artist, he was involved in many Billboard nationally charted records, several gold records worldwide, a Grammy nominee, and several Billboard Awards. In 2006, he was inducted into one of Europe's \\"Dance Music Halls Of Fame\\". Executive career At T.K., Mart√≠nez was influential in introducing the concept of the 12-inch record for promotional purposes. He founded and served as operating president of Paris International, a top independent label. Mart√≠nez taught seminars at the University of Miami in music business and production, and established many new promotion and distribution concepts that later became industry standards. After retirement in the early 1990s, Mart√≠nez continued serving the music industry as a consultant for several music companies and entertainment attorneys. He also ran a family-owned real estate acquisition/investment company. Paris Music Group In 2006, Mart√≠nez decided to come out of retirement, and opened Paris Music Group.

Returning to the castle after exile, they release a group of townsfolk from prison, leading to a huge battle outside. Simon and Shurka face each other on the towers using white and black magic, with Shurka being blasted by his fireball. Simon and Aura are crowned the new King and Queen of Axeholme. Kor departs, looking for more adventure. Production Ed Naha later recalled: > I don't think this movie was so much shot as it was beaten to death.

Reception Wizards of the Lost Kingdom received a mixed-to-positive reception from critics, who consider it a lighter and softer improvement on the Roger Corman Barbarian films of the 80s. Legacy=Sequel In 1989, Wizards of the Lost Kingdom was followed by a sequel (featuring none of the cast or crew of the original film), Wizards of the Lost Kingdom II. Ed Naha stated: > Three years later I'm at a wedding reception for a friend who still works > for Roger. And Roger's there. So we're chatting and kidding around, and I > said, 'Ah, man, remember that \\"Wizards of the Lost Kingdom\\" movie?' And he > said, 'Oh, y'know, that did very well in video. We filmed a sequel!' Mystery Science Theater 3000 On April 14, 2017, both this film and its follow-up were featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 as part of its eleventh season.

The nociceptin receptor is a member of the opioid subfamily of G protein- coupled receptors whose natural ligand is the 17 amino acid neuropeptide known as nociceptin (N/OFQ). This receptor is involved in the regulation of numerous brain activities, particularly instinctive and emotional behaviors. Antagonists targeting NOP are under investigation for their role as treatments for depression and Parkinson's disease, whereas NOP agonists have been shown to act as powerful, non-addictive painkillers in non-human primates. Although NOP shares high sequence identity (~60%) with the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô opioid receptors Œº-OP (MOP), Œ∫-OP (KOP), and Œ¥-OP (DOP), it possesses little or no affinity for opioid peptides or morphine-like compounds. Likewise, classical opioid receptors possess little affinity towards NOP's endogenous ligand nociceptin, which is structurally related to dynorphin A. Discovery In 1994, Mollereau et al. cloned a receptor that was highly homologous to the classical opioid receptors (OPs) Œº-OR (MOP), Œ∫-OR (KOP), and Œ¥-OR (DOP) that came to be known as the Nociceptin Opioid Peptide receptor (NOP). As these ‚Äúclassical‚Äù opioid receptors were identified 30 years earlier in the mid-1960s, the physiological and pharmacological characterization of NOP as well as therapeutic development targeting this receptor remain decades behind. Although research on NOP has blossomed into its own sub-field, the lack of widespread knowledge of NOP's existence means that it is commonly omitted from studies that investigate the OP family, despite its promising role as a therapeutic target. Mechanism and pharmacology= NOP cellular signalling partners  Like most G-protein coupled receptors, NOP signals through canonical G proteins upon activation. G proteins are heterotrimeric complexes consisting of Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ subunits. NOP signals through a variety of GŒ± subtypes that trigger diverse downstream signaling cascades. NOP coupling to GŒ±i or GŒ±o subunits leads to an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) causing an intracellular decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) levels, an important second messenger for many signal transduction pathways. NOP acting through GŒ±i/o pathways has also been shown to activate Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), thereby initiating Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. In contrast to classical OPs, NOP also couples to Pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive subtypes GŒ±z, GŒ±14, and GŒ±16, as well as potentially to GŒ±12 and GŒ±s. Activation of NOP's canonical Œ≤-arrestin pathway causes receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and eventual downregulation and recycling. NOP activation also causes indirect inhibition of opioid receptors MOP and KOP, resulting in anti-opioid activity in certain tissues. Additionally, NOP activation leads to the activation of potassium channels and inhibition of calcium channels which collectively inhibit neuronal firing.  Neuroanatomy  Nociceptin controls a wide range of biological functions ranging from nociception to food intake, from memory processes to cardiovascular and renal functions, from spontaneous locomotor activity to gastrointestinal motility, from anxiety to the control of neurotransmitter release at peripheral and central sites. = Pain circuitry = The outcome of NOP activation on the brain's pain circuitry is site- specific. Within the central nervous system its action can be either similar or opposite to those of opioids depending on their location. In animal models, activation of NOP in the brain stem and higher brain regions has mixed action, resulting in overall anti-opioid activity. NOP activation at the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system results in morphine-comparable analgesia in non- human primates. = Reward circuitry = NOP is highly expressed in every node of the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry. Unlike MOP agonists such as codeine and morphine, NOP agonists do not have reinforcing effects. Nociceptin is thought to be an endogenous antagonist of dopamine transport that may act either directly on dopamine or by inhibiting GABA to affect dopamine levels. In animal models, the result of NOP activation in the central nervous system has been shown to eliminate conditioned place preference induced by morphine, cocaine, alcohol, and methamphetamine. Therapeutic potential= Analgesia and abuse liability  Recent studies indicate that targeting NOP is a promising alternative route to relieving pain without the deleterious side effects of traditional MOP-activating opioid therapies. In primates, specifically activating NOP through systemic or intrathecal administration induces long-lasting, morphine-comparable analgesia without causing itch, respiratory depression, or the reinforcing effects that lead to addiction in an intravenous self-administration paradigm; thus eliminating all of the serious side-effects of current opioid therapies. Several commonly used opioid drugs including etorphine and buprenorphine have been demonstrated to bind to nociceptin receptors, but this binding is relatively insignificant compared to their activity at other opioid receptors in the acute setting (however the non-analgesic NOPr antagonist SB-612,111 was demonstrated to potentiate the therapeutic benefits of morphine). Chronic administration of nociceptin receptor agonists results in an attentuation of the analgesic and anti- allodynic effects of opiates; this mechanism inhibits the action of endogenous opioids as well, resulting in an increase in pain severity, depression, and both physical and psychological opiate dependence following chronic NOPr agonist administration. Administration of the NOPr antagonist SB-612,111 has been shown to inhibit this process. More recently a range of selective ligands for NOP have been developed, which show little or no affinity to other opioid receptors and so allow NOP-mediated responses to be studied in isolation.

He contended in the French presidential election of 2007 under the colours of the Workers' Party (Parti des Travailleurs) of Trotskyist legacy. He came last in the first round of balloting on 22 April, obtaining 0.34% of the popular vote (123,540 votes). Biography Schivardi was born in 1950 in Narbonne. He is married and a father of two. Schivardi has been a master craftsman mason since 1970, and is still in activity as of 2007. From 1973 to 1988, he was president of the syndicate of the masons of Aude. In 1975 he joined the Socialist party. In 1989, he was elected in the city council of Mailhac; in 1995 he became second deputy mayor. He was elected mayor of Mailhac in 2001. He advocated strong public services and increased power and independence of communes, denouncing what he called the \\"forced intercommunality\\". In 2002, Schivardi met Daniel Gluckstein, who convinced him to support his campaign. In July 2003 he was elected representative of the Canton of Ginestas and resigned form the Socialist Party. He then turned \\"Independent socialist\\", and was not a member of a political party afterwards, until he joined the Independent Workers' Party (POI) in 2008. On 20 September 2003 he took position against the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and founded the \\"Comit√© national pour la victoire du vote NON\\" (\\"National committee for victory of NO votes\\"). In 2004, he founded the \\"National Committee for Defense of Communes and Public Services\\" (Comit√© de d√©fense des communes et des services publics). On 18 November, he was selected as candidate supported by a \\"Comit√© National pour la reconqu√™te de la d√©mocratie\\" (\\"National Committee for reconquest of Democracy\\"). On 16 March 2008 he was re-elected as mayor of Mailhac, Aude.  French presidential election of 2007  Schivardi was one of the twelve candidates for the 2007 French presidential election. He was the first \\"small\\" candidate to obtain the 500 sponsorships from elected officials which are necessary to become an official candidate. Schivardi claimed to be an \\"authentic socialist, independent and no affiliate\\". He attempted to run as \\"the mayors' candidate\\" (le candidat des maires), but was barred from doing so after the prime association of French mayors, the Association des Maires de France, obtained an injunction against Schivardi.2 April 2007, Injunction by Isabelle Nicole, first vice-president of the Paris court of large claims A similar decision was reached by the commission overseeing the \\"official campaign\\" of the election; an appeal against this decision was rejected by the Constitutional Council.Decision of 5 April 2007 of the Constitutional Council regarding the request by G√©rard Schivardi (L√©gifrance copy) Schivardi then changed his slogan to candidat de maires, which may be translated as \\"candidate of some mayors\\". The key proposal of Schivardi's programme was that France should withdraw from the European Union and construct a \\"Europe of free people and free nations\\". Several proposals in Schivardi's program, including the election of a new national assembly to suppress the French Fifth Republic's institutions, echo those of Daniel Gluckstein in 2002. In addition to his far-left-wing base of syndicalists and Workers' Party militants, Schivardi was supported by some mayors affiliated of the Socialist Party, French Communist Party, Union for a Popular Movement or Union for French Democracy, who don't support the communal policy of their parties. Schivardi's official site and documentation said that he was supported by the Workers' Party, but he denied being a member of that party, or a trotskyist.

The regions of the brain where the Œ¥-opioid receptor is largely expressed vary from species model to species model. In humans, the Œ¥-opioid receptor is most heavily expressed in the basal ganglia and neocortical regions of the brain.  Function  The endogenous system of opioid receptors is well known for its analgesic potential; however, the exact role of Œ¥-opioid receptor activation in pain modulation is largely up for debate. This also depends on the model at hand since receptor activity is known to change from species to species. Activation of delta receptors produces analgesia, perhaps as significant potentiators of Œº-opioid receptor agonists. However, it seems like delta agonism provides heavy potentiation to any mu agonism. Therefore, even selective mu agonists can cause analgesia under the right conditions, whereas under others can cause none whatsoever.Alvimopan It is also suggested however that the pain modulated by the Œº-opioid receptor and that modulated by the Œ¥-opioid receptor are distinct types, with the assertion that DOR modulates the nociception of chronic pain, while MOR modulates acute pain. Evidence for whether delta agonists produce respiratory depression is mixed; high doses of the delta agonist peptide DPDPE produced respiratory depression in sheep, but in tests on mice the non-peptide delta agonist SNC-80 produced respiratory depression only at the very high dose of 40 mg/kg. In contrast both the peptide delta agonist Deltorphin II and the non-peptide delta agonist (+)-BW373U86 actually stimulated respiratory function and blocked the respiratory depressant effect of the potent Œº-opioid agonist alfentanil, without affecting pain relief. It thus seems likely that while Œ¥-opioid agonists can produce respiratory depression at very high doses, at lower doses they have the opposite effect, a fact that may make mixed mu/delta agonists such as DPI-3290 potentially very useful drugs that might be much safer than the Œº agonists currently used for pain relief. Many delta agonists may also cause seizures at high doses, although not all delta agonists produce this effect. Of additional interest is the potential for delta agonists to be developed for use as a novel class of antidepressant drugs, following robust evidence of both antidepressant effects and also upregulation of BDNF production in the brain in animal models of depression. These antidepressant effects have been linked to endogenous opioid peptides acting at Œ¥- and Œº-opioid receptors, and so can also be produced by enkephalinase inhibitors such as RB-101. ] However, in human models the data for antidepressant effects remains inconclusive. In the 2008 Phase 2 clinical trial by Astra Zeneca, NCT00759395, 15 patients were treated with the selective delta agonist AZD 2327. The results showed no significant effect on mood suggesting that Œ¥-opioid receptor modulation might not participate in the regulation of mood in humans. However, doses were administered at low doses and the pharmacological data also remains inconclusive. Further trials are required. Another interesting aspect of Œ¥-opioid receptor function is the suggestion of Œº/Œ¥-opioid receptor interactions. At the extremes of this suggestion lies the possibility of a Œº/Œ¥ opioid receptor oligomer. The evidence for this stems from the different binding profiles of typical mu and delta agonists such as morphine and DAMGO respectively, in cells that coexpress both receptors compared to those in cells that express them individually. In addition, work by Fan and coworkers shows the restoration of the binding profiles when distal carboxyl termini are truncated at either receptor, suggesting that the termini play a role in the oligomerization. While this is exciting, rebuttal by the Javitch and coworkers suggest the idea of oligomerization may be overplayed. Relying on RET, Javitch and coworkers showed that RET signals were more characteristic of random proximity between receptors, rather than an actual bond formation between receptors, suggesting that discrepancies in binding profiles may be the result of downstream interactions, rather than novel effects due to oligomerization. Nevertheless, coexpression of receptors remains unique and potentially useful in the treatment of mood disorders and pain. Recent work indicates that exogenous ligands that activate the delta receptors mimic the phenomenon known as ischemic preconditioning. Experimentally, if short periods of transient ischemia are induced the downstream tissues are robustly protected if longer- duration interruption of the blood supply is then affected. Opiates and opioids with DOR activity mimic this effect. In the rat model, introduction of DOR ligands results in significant cardioprotection. Ligands Until comparatively recently, there were few pharmacological tools for the study of Œ¥ receptors. As a consequence, our understanding of their function is much more limited than those of the other opioid receptors for which selective ligands have long been available. However, there are now several selective Œ¥-opioid receptor agonists available, including peptides such as DPDPE and deltorphin II, and non-peptide drugs such as SNC-80, the more potent (+)-BW373U86, a newer drug DPI-287, which does not produce the problems with convulsions seen with the earlier agents, and the mixed Œº/Œ¥ agonist DPI-3290, which is a much more potent analgesic than the more highly selective Œ¥ agonists. Selective antagonists for the Œ¥ receptor are also available, with the best known being the opiate derivative naltrindole.

The highway also intersects in Yelm and in McKenna. The first appearance of the roadway on a map was in 1916 and since, two highways, (SSH 5H) and , were established on the current route of SR 507 in 1937 and 1943. They both became SR 507 during the 1964 highway renumbering. Route description State Route 507 (SR 507) begins at a diamond interchange with (I-5), co-signed as (US 12) in Centralia. Traveling east as Mellen, Alder and West Cherry Streets, the highway crosses railroad tracks owned by BNSF Railway and used by Amtrak's Cascades and Coast Starlight routes, both of which serve the Centralia Amtrak station. The roadway later intersects Pearl Street, the only couplet on SR 507, which parallels Tower Avenue through Downtown Centralia. The street then becomes Tower Avenue and turns north to pass the Centralia Amtrak station. SR 507 realigns west as Sixth Street to intersect and become Pearl Street, once again traveling northeast as Downing Road to leave Centralia. Still parallel to BNSF Railway tracks, the road leaves Lewis County, enters Thurston County, passes Bucoda and turns north to intersect an old segment of in Tenino. Within Tenino, the highway stops paralleling the BNSF tracks and goes east through the city as Sussex Avenue and starts to parallel a route of the Tacoma Rail eastward out of the city. Passing through Rainier as Binghampton Street, the roadway intersects the eastern terminus of in Yelm and then turns southeast as Yelm Avenue, before leaving both Yelm and Thurston County to enter Pierce County on a bridge over the Nisqually River. Once in Pierce County, SR 507 intersects in McKenna and continues north as the Spanaway McKenna Highway to Roy, where the highway turns east and then northeast into Fort Lewis. Immediately after leaving Fort Lewis, the roadway ends at an intersection with in Spanaway. Between SR 510 in Yelm and SR 702 in McKenna, the roadway had an estimated daily average of 19,000 motorists in 2007, causing the segment to be the busiest on SR 507. The busiest segment in 1970 was the Maple Street junction in Downtown Centralia, with an estimated daily average of 14,000 motorists. SR 507 is also the southern segment of the East Pacific Highway, which runs from Centralia to Sumas. Couplet Within Downtown Centralia, SR 507 splits into two streets, northbound on Tower Avenue and southbound on Pearl Street, which has been designated SR 507 CO Pearl. The busiest segment of the long couplet was the Cherry Street intersection, with an estimated daily average of 9,700 motorists in 2007. History The first appearance of a highway located on the current route of SR 507 was in a 1916 map of the Chehalis area. A road extending northwest from Centralia to Roy was shown serving the communities that SR 507 currently serves. In 1937, during the creation of the Primary and secondary highways, (SSH 5H) was established, running from Tenino to Spanaway. A section of 507 houses the Tenino Downtown Historic District. In 1943, , running from Centralia to Tenino, was created. In 1964, a highway renumbering replaced both SSH 5H and SSH 1N with SR 507. A left turn lane was installed at the Yew Street intersection east of the (I-5) and (US 12) interchange in Centralia on May 24, 2007. , when completed, is predicted to reduce congestion on SR 507. A section of the highway near Rainier was renamed the Sgt. Justin. D. Norton Memorial Highway in 2017 to honor a local soldier.

Written by Robert Hull and directed by John T. Kretchmer, the episode premiered on The CW on May 1, 2007. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica is hired by an Arab couple who own a Middle Eastern restaurant because their restaurant has recently had the word \\"terrorist\\" spray-painted on it. Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), as acting Sheriff, looks into underage drinking regulations in local bars after the case of a drunk 19-year-old getting hit by a car comes to Keith's attention, eventually finding that Veronica is handing out convincing fake IDs to her fellow students. In addition, Veronica attends a birthday party run by Logan (Jason Dohring) for his new girlfriend Parker (Julie Gonzalo). \\"Un-American Graffiti\\" was the first episode of the series not to be part of a larger story arc. This was a change that had been decided upon midway through the season, and series creator Thomas thought that this would make the series more accessible to new viewers. In addition, the episode aired after a two-month hiatus, during which period Thomas created the idea for season four taking place in the FBI Academy. In its original broadcast, the episode garnered 2.35 million viewers and generally negative reviews from television critics, with many criticizing the case-of-the-week as clich√© and moralistic. Eric Goldman of IGN compared the episode negatively to an after school special, while Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, disliked the portrayal of Rashad.  Plot synopsis  Logan invites Veronica to Parker's birthday party. A woman (Carole Raphaelle Davis) comes into Mars Investigations and says that her restaurant was vandalized. Veronica stakes out the restaurant before the owner's husband (Anthony Azizi) comes out and berates her to leave. However, while they are speaking, a group of troublemakers appear and shoot paintballs at Veronica and the married couple. The husband acquiesces to allow Veronica to investigate both incidents further. Keith, as acting Sheriff, is called in to look into a case involving a 19-year-old who was hit while returning home drunk from a bar using an obviously fake ID. Veronica tracks down the family of the car that was used in the paintball incident and finds that it is under the control of a group of young people. Keith's underlings state that the bars are actually good at keeping out minors. Veronica reviews security cameras at the restaurant and tracks a person down to be a Jewish man with whom the restaurant owner's daughter has been having an affair. An employee named Nasir (Haaz Sleiman) has taken explicit photos of the two, and Amira's father will disown her if the father finds out. Veronica goes to a photo-developing store and retrieves the photos, but one is stuck in the printer and Nasir gets it. Amira's father shows up at her door and angrily berates her and fires Veronica, although she says that her real employer is his wife. Keith catches Wallace and Piz, out for a night on the town, in a bar, discovering that they have high-quality fake IDs from Veronica, leading Keith to reprimand her. Veronica discovers the true vandal after tracking a piece of bait. The vandal's name is Derrick (Cole Williams), who vandalized after seeing Nasir distributing a piece of anti- American propaganda at a mall. Both owners want to meet Derrick before pressing charges. Keith sends Piz (Chris Lowell) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with clearly fake IDs into a bar as a test of his subordinates. He finds that the deputy does not check closely and resents Keith as well. Due to this fact, Keith fires the people who disobeyed his orders. The two restaurant owners meet with Derrick, who does not react politely to them. However, they decide not to turn in Derrick. The husband/father has an awakening about Amira as well and forgives her, turning in Nasir to the police for an expired visa. At Parker's party, Mac (Tina Majorino) connects with Max (Adam Rose), and Veronica shows mild jealousy when Piz shows her his new fling. Logan gets Parker a romantic cake. In order to escape from an awkward suitor whom Logan introduces her to, Veronica asks Piz to pretend to be her boyfriend. Afterwards, Wallace informs her that Piz does have a crush on her. Veronica realizes that she has not realized this because of her preoccupation with her breakup with Logan. She talks to Piz on the deck at the party, and he suddenly kisses her. Piz retreats to the elevator, but Veronica appears and kisses him back. The elevator opens, revealing Logan.  Production  Enrico Colantoni stated prior to the airing of the episode that The CW had seen Thomas's FBI pitch for the next season and rejected it, a comment that was denied by both Thomas and a network representative. \\"Un-American Graffiti\\" was written by Robert Hull and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Hull's second and final writing credit (after \\"Show Me the Monkey\\") and Kretchmer's fourteenth and final directing credit for the series. \\"Un-American Graffiti\\" introduces a romantic storyline between Mac (Tina Majorino) and Max (Adam Rose). Max had appeared in two previous episodes‚Äîas a suspect in \\"Hi, Infidelity\\" and as the main client in \\"Poughkeepsie, Tramps and Thieves\\". From the very beginning of his appearances, Max was planned to begin a romantic relationship with Mac. Rose was roommates with the other main love interest for her, Bronson Pope (Michael Mitchell). When Rose received the call that he would be appearing in more episodes for a romantic storyline with Mac, Rose stated, \\"But I thought that's what my roommate was doing.\\" \\"Un-American Graffiti\\" is the first episode of Veronica Mars not to be part of a broader story arc in the form of a mystery that Veronica solves over several episodes. The crew's plan at the beginning of the season was to have the two-part murder mystery of Hearst's basketball coach, encapsulated in \\"Postgame Mortem\\" and \\"Mars, Bars\\", to stretch over the rest of the season beginning with this episode, but this idea was changed around the airing of \\"Spit & Eggs\\". Series creator Rob Thomas gave two rationales for the creative change. The first was that he believed that the story arcs alienated new or casual viewers, meaning that the change would solve the series' low Nielsen ratings, while the other reason was that he noticed that after the first season, the show had garnered the most narrative criticism about the story arcs. On trying the new narrative structure, Thomas stated, \\"It seems like a good time to do it‚Äîa good fun test balloon. Try it over five [episodes] and see how fans and non-fans react.\\" However, Thomas also commented that the show would continue to exhibit a degree of serialization through Veronica's romantic and personal life. In addition, the new story formula was a way to have episodes focus on Veronica's personal life instead of devoting most of the episode time to advancing rushed mysteries. The episode also features the first kiss of the characters of Piz (Chris Lowell) and Veronica, creating a love triangle between the two and Logan (Jason Dohring) that would last for the rest of the series and the Veronica Mars movie, dividing fans into \\"Team Logan\\" and \\"Team Piz\\", depending on which relationship they preferred. The song \\"Rally\\" by alternative rock band Phoenix plays during Veronica and Piz's kiss. Thomas highlighted the scene in Veronica returns home to find Keith reading classified ads as one of his favorite moments between the father/daughter pair in the season, stating that they both fulfilled the writers' initial vision for the scene and that Kristen Bell in particular interpreted her lines well. The episode was the first to air after nearly a two-month hiatus, during which Thomas came up for the idea for season four to take place in the FBI Academy. Possibly done as a last-resort attempt to save the show from cancellation, the series was very much on the brink of cancellation at this point in production. Prior to the airing of \\"Un-American Graffiti\\", Enrico Colantoni stated that The CW had seen the filmed first ten pages and reacted negatively. However, Thomas denied this testimony and commented that The CW had not yet seen the FBI pitch and would on May 2, the day after the series' return, a statement that was confirmed to be true by a representative for the network. Prior to the episode's airing, information was released stating that middle school students would be involved in the episode, leading BuddyTV to speculate that Logan's young friend from \\"Postgame Mortem\\" would make an appearance.  Reception = Ratings  In its original broadcast, \\"Un-American Graffiti\\" received 2.35 million viewers, ranking 95th of 98 in the weekly rankings. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Papa's Cabin\\", which garnered 2.66 million viewers.  Reviews  \\"Un- American Graffiti\\" received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many criticizing the case-of-the-week as clich√© and moralistic and opining that it was not a strong start for the show's new episode formula. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating that it was \\"good\\". He was very critical of the case-of-the-week and Keith's plotline as Sheriff, comparing them both negatively to an after school special. He disliked what he considered to be the clich√© storyline and stereotyped characters of the restaurant plot, particularly the trope of the disapproving Arab-American father and the plotline ending with a speech about the American dream, concluding that \\"even Veronica pointing out this clich√© didn't make it less so.\\" While opining that Logan's actions were out of character, the reviewer was more positive towards the budding relationships of Veronica and Piz and Mac and Max. Television Without Pity graded the episode a \\"C\\", with the reviewer stating that it was the only episode of the series that they did not like. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, was very negative towards the episode. While stating that it was very preachy and generally boring, particularly in the case-of-the-week, he believed that the episode was just a fluke because he had already been sent the next episode, \\"Debasement Tapes\\", which he enjoyed. While being less critical of the episode's other subplots, he concluded that \\"this wasn't exactly [a] triumphant return.\\" Kelly West of Cinema Blend was mixed towards the episode. While calling the new formula \\"a breath of fresh air,\\" she was not entirely pleased with the final scene featuring Piz and Veronica's kiss, opining that the location and the fact that Veronica ran after Piz and kissed him back were not in keeping with Veronica's character. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club was also critical of the case of the week and the episode in general. While admiring the show's decision to address the controversial issue of Islamophobia in the United States, she did not like the show's characterization of Rashad, the father, noting inconsistencies about whether his storyline was one of redemption or not. \\"There are three seemingly equal interpretations: that Veronica Mars writers believe that the cartoon is worth ruining someone's life over; that Rashad is a complex character who can be petty and vindictive; or, it's just a bunch of stuff that happens and there is no moral.\\"  References  External links  * *\\"Un-American Graffiti\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 3) episodes ","title":"Un-American Graffiti"},{"id":"10059117","text":"Mijiu () is a Chinese rice wine made from glutinous rice.Carlson, Gordon S. (1981). The Rice Journal. Volumes 84-87. p. 263. It is generally clear in appearance with balanced sweetness and acidity, similar to its Japanese counterpart sake and Korean counterpart cheongju. The alcohol content ranges between 15% and 20%. Rice wine was made around or before 1000 BC in ancient China, and then the practice spread to Japan and other East Asian countries. Since then, it has played an important role in Chinese life. In most Chinese supermarkets there are various kinds of rice wines. It is a traditional beverage to the Chinese and some of the families still follow the custom of making rice wine by themselves. The rice wine is made using glutinous rice, Chinese yeast and water. It is also served as an aperitif and is believed to be beneficial in improving metabolism and skin. Mijiu is usually drunk warm, like the Japanese sake and Korean cheongju, and is also used in cooking. The cooking mijiu available in Asian grocery stores are generally of a lower quality, and often contain added salt to avoid an alcohol tax. Mijiu is produced in mainland China and Taiwan. A type of baijiu called rice baijiu () is distilled from mijiu. An unfiltered form of Chinese rice wine containing whole glutinous rice grains of extremely low alcoholic content and often consumed by children is called ji«îni√†ng () or l√°ozƒÅo (). In Taiwan, the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (Monopoly Bureau) is the main manufacturer, branded as Taiwan red label. The alcohol content is 19.5%. Mijiu is commonly used in cooking dishes such as ginger duck, sesame oil chicken, and shochu chicken. Usage The traditional way to use mijiu is to boil three bottles and evaporate the alcohol while cooking with the chicken. It is believed that by using this recipe one can help women's rehabilitation wound. Mijiu is also used in Jiuniang which is a dish that consists of the rice wine, rice particles, and sometimes glutinous rice balls.

Written by John Enbom and directed by Dan Etheridge, the episode premiered on The CW on May 8, 2007. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Piz (Chris Lowell) gets the chance to interview one of the members of his favorite band, a washed-up rock star named Desmond Fellows (Paul Rudd). However, when Desmond's backing tapes that he needs for the show the next night disappear, Veronica is called in to find them. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) enlists Mac's (Tina Majorino) help in creating a presentation for his business class. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) learns that Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) is challenging him in the upcoming Sheriff election. \\"Debasement Tapes\\" features a guest appearance by Paul Rudd. A friend of series creator Rob Thomas and Enbom, they had hoped that Rudd would guest star on the show since its inception in 2004. Announced four months prior to the episode's airing, his appearance was highly anticipated by Thomas, who had high hopes for the pairing of Rudd and Enbom. In its original broadcast, the episode received 1.85 million viewers and mostly positive reviews from television critics, with Rudd's performance and the various subplots being generally well-received, although some disliked the main mystery.  Plot synopsis  Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) watch a movie at her house. She questions him about Piz‚Äôs mood, while Keith enters and says he is currently unopposed in the Sheriff election. Piz runs up to Veronica and states that he has been chosen to be a guide for a rock star named Desmond Fellows. However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks him into his hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and she agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, and it goes terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find a flyer for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond‚Äôs show. Piz and Desmond talk about his past and start to make progress, but he ends up going to a party with Dick (Ryan Hansen) instead of playing guitar with Piz. Logan and Mac continue to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond‚Äôs bag was actually switched with another person‚Äôs. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond‚Äôs unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D‚ÄôAmato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake out where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material. Desmond plays a show entirely of new songs, and the crowd loves it. Piz tells Desmond that he was there the whole time, but he does not react negatively. Mac, Max and Logan finish their report, but the professor cuts Logan off in the middle and dislikes it. Leo becomes a deputy again, while Vinnie enters the Sheriff‚Äôs office and states his intention to run against Keith in the special election.  Production  Paul Rudd guest stars in \\"Debasement Tapes\\". \\"Debasement Tapes\\" was written by John Enbom and directed by supervising producer Dan Etheridge, marking Enbom's seventeenth and final writing credit for the show and Etheridge's first and only directing credit for the series. The episode guest stars actor Paul Rudd as former rock star Desmond Fellows. During casting of the character of Vinnie Van Lowe, Rudd was considered to play the part; however, the role was given instead to Ken Marino, who appears in the episode. Marino and Rudd are friends in real life. Rudd was a friend of Enbom and Etheridge, and he had been signed on to appear in the episode by the airing of \\"Spit & Eggs\\". They had lobbied Rudd to come on the show for several years. Thomas described the reason for Rudd not appearing earlier being that the crew were unable to find a good moment for the character's entry that worked with Rudd's schedule. Series creator Rob Thomas thought that the character would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had high expectations for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present. The scene in which Desmond goes nude swimming was not included in the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.  Reception = Ratings  In its original broadcast, \\"Debasement Tapes\\" received 1.85 million viewers, ranking 96th of 98 in the weekly rankings. This was a moderate decrease from the previous episode, \\"Un-American Graffiti\\", which earned 2.35 million viewers.  Reviews  The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics, with Rudd's performance and the various subplots being generally well-received, although some disliked the main mystery. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode a 7.8 out of 10, indicating that it was \\"good\\". He generally praised Rudd's performance and the case-of-the week, but he was critical of its ending, stating that \\"after last week, it was a bit too much of another 'and that's one to grow on' conclusion.\\" He was also mixed towards the episode's subplots, enjoying Mac's romantic storyline but disliking Logan's continued interest in Veronica. He also referred to Vinnie running for Sheriff as \\"a bit ridiculous\\". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode, particularly Rudd's performance. He stated that Rudd, despite playing a stock character, \\"made me feel like I hadn't seen it a thousand times before.\\" He also enjoyed the pairing of Mac and Max, while he believed that the impact of Vinnie and Leo's reappearances was blunted by the knowledge that the show would likely not return for a fourth season. Television Without Pity graded the episode a \\"B\\". The Los Angeles Times praised Rudd's performance while criticizing his storyline and the mystery-of- the-week. While stating that Kristen Bell is usually the scene stealer, the reviewer thought that Rudd took on that role in this episode. However, the reviewer called his mystery \\"an excuse just to get Rudd on the screen.\\" Missy Schwartz of Entertainment Weekly was also positive towards the episode particularly Rudd's performance and the episode's subplots. While criticizing the case-of-the-week's ending as anticlimactic, she thought that Rudd's singing was better than expected. The reviewer also lauded the comedic portions of the subplots, particularly the scene in which Dick compares himself to a lion and Mac and Veronica compare their romantic interests to cafeteria food. Brill Bundy of Zap2it was mostly positive towards the episode, particularly praising Rudd's comedic timing and the episode's use of supporting series regulars such as Mac and Piz. He also commented positively on the development of the romantic storyline between Piz and Veronica, stating that it was realistic. However, the reviewer did not think that the mystery involving Rudd's character was necessary and that it would have been better to not have a mystery at all. Stereogum referred to the opening scene of the episode as \\"Rudd generally being awesome.\\" Cortney Martin, writing for the Houston Chronicle, was mixed overall. While being complimentary towards Rudd's performance and Greenfield's reappearance, the reviewer disliked the mystery of Desmond's missing tapes, stating, \\"the mystery of the week turns out to be the lamest non-mystery of the show's entire run, I think.\\" The reviewer opined that the subplot involving the Fitzpatricks was boring but that Marino's reappearance was a good surprise. Brian Raftery of Idolator believed that Rudd's character could have been based on a number of different real-life figures but guessed Courtney Love and Matthew Sweet as potential influences. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised the episode as the best of the season so far. He lauded the development of the romantic storylines of both Veronica and Mac, while stating that Veronica's was more realistic, describing the concert scene in which Veronica and Piz hold hands again was genuinely emotional. He also stated that Rudd \\"changes Fellows from a painful stereotype into a pantheon one-off character.\\" The reviewer also opined that the episode's combination of Rudd and the subplot involving Logan and Mac created a very entertaining episode that was exemplary of how well the new story structure could work.

They consist mainly of four groups: prisoners-of-war in the Soviet Union, Japanese accompanying repatriating Zainichi Korean spouses, defectors, and kidnapping victims. The number who remain alive is not known. Background In 1945, with the end of World War II and the collapse of the Empire of Japan, 200,000 Japanese colonists were stranded north of the 38th parallel; however, they were repatriated to Japan soon after. The earliest and largest post-war influx of Japanese to North Korea was involuntary: 27,000 prisoners-of-war from the Soviet Union. Their current whereabouts are unknown; documents from Russian archives suggest that only the physically ill were sent to North Korea, while able-bodied men were retained by Russia to perform forced labour there. Spouses of repatriating Zainichi Koreans Voluntary migration of Japanese to North Korea began in 1959, under a repatriation campaign for Zainichi Koreans sponsored by ethnic activist organisation and de facto North Korean embassy Chongryon. Chongryon received the tacit support of the Japanese and American governments, who saw Koreans in Japan as \\"Communists\\" and \\"criminals\\", in the words of the US ambassador to Japan at the time, Douglas MacArthur II; they welcomed the repatriation campaign as a way of reducing the ethnic minority population. In total, 6,637 Japanese people are estimated to have accompanied Korean spouses to North Korea, of whom 1,828 retained their Japanese nationality. See section \\"Koreans Living Overseas\\". The numbers of both Japanese and Koreans going to North Korea dropped sharply in the 1960s as knowledge of the poor economic conditions, social discrimination, and political repression faced by both Korean and Japanese migrants filtered back to Japan by word of mouth. According to North Korean defector Kang Chol-Hwan, himself the son of participants in the repatriation campaign, Japanese wives of Korean men led Pyongyang's first anti-government demonstration in North Korean history, when they staged a protest appealing for permission to return home. Kang also relayed an anecdote about Kim Il-sung being shocked when one Japanese woman showed up when he was making a \\"spot visit\\" to a mine in South Hamgyong Province and personally begged to him to be allowed to go back to Japan. These two events are said to have been the impetus for the 1970s purges of migrants from Japan, in which many Chongryon members and their families were sent to detention camps or killed. Two-thirds of the Japanese who migrated to North Korea are estimated to have gone missing or have never been heard from. However, in spite of the harsh political situation, migration to North Korea did not stop completely until 1984. , North Korea had refused to provide Japan with a list of surviving Japanese in the country, and had only permitted a few small groups of 10-15 to travel to Japan. They further objected to the Japanese practice of referring to such trips as \\"visits home\\", instead preferring to call them \\"temporary visitors\\" or even \\"government delegations\\". Defections and kidnappings The nine members of the Japanese Communist League-Red Army Faction (the predecessor of the Japanese Red Army) who hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 351 are known to have received political asylum in Pyongyang in 1970; of those, two were later arrested by Japanese police in Thailand, two died in North Korea, and five are still believed to reside in Pyongyang. Four were confirmed to be alive in 2004 when they were interviewed and photographed by Kyodo News. North Korea is also believed to have kidnapped between 70 and 80 Japanese citizens between 1977 and 1983 in order to teach the Japanese language to North Korean intelligence operatives; however, the government of North Korea officially admits to only 16 such kidnappings. In 2003, Kazumi Kitagawa, a Japanese citizen and former member of Aum Shinrikyo, jumped overboard from a Chinese tourist boat on the Yalu River and swam to North Korea where she requested asylum. Her actions made her the first Japanese defector to North Korea since the Flight 351 hijacking. However, after two years of living in a hotel where she reportedly had complaints about her hotel room, clothing, and constant surveillance by guards, she arranged to be returned to Japan.

He made his challenge on February 17, 2007, defeating Kondo to end his 16-month reign, and becoming the youngest junior heavyweight champion in history. Nakajima made his first defense of the title on April 30, 2007, defeating Kondo's Voodoo Murders partner \\"brother\\" YASSHI, as well as Ryuji Hijikata on May 27, 2007. Nakajima once again participated in the Junior League in June 2007, finishing in third place for his block with four points, behind Hijikata and Kondo. The league was won by American wrestler Chris Sabin, setting up a title match between Sabin and Nakajima on August 26, 2007, in which Nakajima was victorious. On September 1, 2007, Nakajima challenged Pro Wrestling Noah's Takeshi Morishima for his ROH World Championship in the main event of a Kensuke Office show, putting up a good fight but losing in the end. On September 19, 2007, Nakajima was pinned in a tag team match by visiting luchador Silver King, who then challenged Nakajima to a future junior heavyweight title match. The match was made official for October 18, 2007 at All Japan's 35th anniversary show; on October 8, 2007, Nakajima suffered a fractured navicular bone in his right hand, forcing him off of several shows on the tour, though he defended the title as scheduled. When the match came, Nakajima and Silver King fought to a no contest, forcing PWF commissioner Hiroshi Hase to hold up the title belt, although Nakajima remained the official champion. Katsuhiko then took time off to nurse his injured hand. 2008 Nakajima returned from injury on February 11, 2008 at Kensuke Office's first anniversary show, defeating fellow Kensuke Sasaki prot√©g√© Ryuji Yamaguchi; he would follow this up with victories over two more Kensuke trainees in Kento Miyahara and Takashi Okita on February 16, 2008 and March 9, 2008 respectively, held in the Kensuke Office exercise hall. On March 1, 2008, in a rematch from their October encounter, Nakajima lost to Silver King in a match to decide the vacant junior heavyweight title. Later that month, Nakajima teamed with Ryuji Hijikata to participate in the six-team Junior Tag League, winning the tournament with six points by defeating the teams of Silver King and Shuji Kondo, MAZADA and NOSAWA Rongai, and T28 and KUSHIDA, as well as Kaz Hayashi and El Samurai in the final, who had defeated them in the group stage. On March 28, 2008, Nakajima faced and defeated Osaka Pro and Dragon Gate wrestler Magnitude Kishiwada on Kensuke Office's first event in the Fukuoka region. In March and April 2008, Nakajima and Sasaki participated in Pro Wrestling Noah's Global Tag League, a 9-team round-robin tag team tournament. The two finished tied in 5th place with 8 points, defeating the teams of Jun Akiyama and Takeshi Rikio, D'Lo Brown and Buchanan, and Go Shiozaki and Akira Taue, and drawing with Takeshi Morishima and Muhammad Yone, and GHC Tag Team Champions Naomichi Marufuji and Takashi Sugiura. On May 25, 2008 in AJPW, Nakajima and Sasaki lost to Taiy≈ç Kea and Minoru Suzuki in a match to determine the #1 contenders to the World Tag Team Championship. On June 13, 2008 at Kensuke Office's \\"Take the Dream Vol. 5\\", Nakajima faced NOAH's Kenta, losing the contest after 27 minutes. The following night in NOAH, Sasaki and Nakajima faced Kenta Kobashi and Kenta, wrestling to a 30-minute time limit draw. On June 29, 2008, Nakajima wrestled what would be his last match in AJPW for the time being, teaming with Kaz Hayashi to defeat Ryuji Hijikata and T28. Nakajima began to wrestle consistently with NOAH starting July 2, 2008, and it was announced the following week that he and the rest of Kensuke Office would be lending their support to NOAH instead of All Japan for the foreseeable future. Among Nakajima's first matches in NOAH were singles contests against former GHC Heavyweight Champions Jun Akiyama and Mitsuharu Misawa on July 5, 2008 and July 13, 2008 respectively, losing both matches. In August and September 2008, Nakajima entered NOAH's annual NTV Cup junior heavyweight tag team league, teaming with DDT's Kota Ibushi in the 8-team tournament. The two finished in fifth place with eight points, including a victory over 2007 winners, as well as the eventual 2008 winners, Kenta and Taiji Ishimori. Nakajima and Ibushi would team once more on September 8, 2008 on a co-production between DDT and SEM, NOAH's offshoot promotion for younger wrestlers, against DDT's HARASHIMA and Antonio Honda. The match originally went to a 20-minute time limit draw, but was restarted and Nakajima pinned Honda shortly thereafter. On September 14, 2008, Nakajima participated in American promotion Ring of Honor's second tour of Japan, teaming with Naomichi Marufuji against Kenta and Kota Ibushi in a special tag match. The two teams went to a 30-minute time limit draw; the match was restarted, but ended once more in a draw after an additional five minutes expired. The following week on September 20, Nakajima wrestled his first match in the United States, challenging GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion Bryan Danielson at ROH's Glory by Honor VII. Danielson would retain his title, making Nakajima submit to the Cattle Mutilation. 2009 Nakajima (right) with Kenta (far left) and Samoa Joe in 2009 Nakajima went to win the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship from Kenta using his Death Roll at the February 11th Kensuke Office event. A notable fact is that this was the second time Nakajima and Sasaki held the Jr. Heavyweight and Heavyweight titles of the same promotion at the same time, the first being All Japan. He would then lose the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship back to Kenta via a Go 2 Sleep at the March 1st Pro Wrestling Noah event; coincidentally, Sasaki would lose the GHC Heavyweight Title later that night. On Nov. 13 Nakajima made his return to Ring of Honor in Novi, Michigan in a losing effort against Kenny Omega. The next night in Mississauga Ontario he was victorious against El Generico in a match that was hard hitting and fast paced. The fans in turn gave Nakajima the \\"please come back\\" chant. 2011‚Äìpresent On September 23, 2011, Nakajima defeated Kotaro Suzuki to win the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. However, he was forced to vacate the title just nine days later, after undergoing surgery for acute appendicitis. Nakajima returned on November 27 and defeated Ricky Marvin in a decision match to regain the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship. On May 9, 2012, Nakajima lost the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship to Yoshinobu Kanemaru, ending his third reign at 164 days. Nakajima along with his mentor Kensuke Sasaki reached the Pro Wrestling Noah Global Tag League final in 2013, but lost to the team of KENTA and Yoshihiro Takayama. Nakajima then took part in a brief feud with Maybach Taniguchi which culminated at the NOAH \\"GREAT VOYAGE 2013 IN TOKYO\\" event. Also at the event Naomichi Marufuji recruited Nakajima into his faction \\"Brave\\". On February 11, 2014, Nakajima earned his first win over his mentor Kensuke Sasaki in the main event of a show celebrating his tenth anniversary in professional wrestling. The match turned out to be Sasaki's retirement match. On July 31, 2015, Nakajima left Diamond Ring. On December 24, 2015, Noah held a press conference announcing that Nakajima would be ending his days as a freelancer and officially joining the promotion on January 1, 2016. On February 24, 2016, Nakajima picked up the biggest win of his career by defeating Minoru Suzuki in the main event of Noah's show in Korakuen Hall. As a result, Nakajima was granted a shot at the GHC Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by Takashi Sugiura on March 19. Nakajima in August 2016 From July 22 to August 13, 2016, Nakajima took part in NJPW's 2016 G1 Climax, where he finished tied third in his block with a record of five wins and four losses, failing to advance to the finals. On October 23, Nakajima defeated Takashi Sugiura to win the GHC Heavyweight Championship for the first time. Nakajima made his first title defense in a match against the 2016 Global League winner, Minoru Suzuki, at One Night Cruise in Korakuen on December 2. Nakajima's second title defense was on December 24 as a part the Winter Navigation tour where he defended his title against his ally and occasional tag team partner, Masa Kitamiya. Following the match, Sugiura challenged Nakajima to a rematch for the title. This rematch would take place on January 7, 2017, which was the first show of Noah's first tour of 2017 \\"The First Navigation.\\" Nakajima ultimately defeated Sugiura thus marking his third title defense. Nakajima defeated Go Shiozaki at \\"Great Voyage in Yokohama\\" on March 12, 2017, marking his fourth title defense. On June 4, 2017 at \\"Navigation with Breeze\\", Nakajima made his fifth title defense against Muhammad Yone. He followed it up with his sixth successful defense against Atsushi Kotoge on June 25, 2017. On July 20, he defeated Brian Cage to make his seventh successful defense. On August 26, Nakajima lost the title to Eddie Edwards in his eighth defense. On March 11, 2018, Nakajima and Kitamiya defeated 50 Funky Powers (Muhammad Yone and Quiet Storm) to win the GHC Tag Team Championship for the first time together, thus marking Nakajima's first reign with the title. However on April 29, they lost the titles to Go Shiozaki and Kaito Kiyomiya in their first defense. After the match, Nakajima and Kitamiya attacked Shiozaki and Kiyomiya, with Nakajima showing a new, more sadistic personality in the following months. They regained the titles one month later only to again lose them in their first defense on July 28 to Naomichi Marufuji and Akitoshi Saito. After Kitamiya unsuccessfully challenged Takashi Sugiura for the GHC Heavyweight Championship, he was challenged to a title match by the champion, which he accepted. Nakajima would also unsuccessfully challenge Sugiura for the title on October 4. Nakajima participated on the 2018 Global League, winning 4 matches and losing 2, failing to advance to the finals. However, after Naomichi Marufuji suffered an injury on his shoulder, a three way match to determine the new finalist between Kenoh, Kohei Sato and Katsuhiko Nakajima happened on November 25, which Nakajima won. On the finals, Nakajima would lost to Kaito Kiyomiya. Naomichi Marufuji and Akitoshi Saito vacated the GHC Tag Team Championship on November 28, a tournament to decide the new champions happened on December 7. Nakajima teamed with Go Shiozaki, and together they would defeat Cody Hall and Maybach Taniguchi at the first round, and Kenoh and Masa Kitamiya at the finals. They would lost the titles 9 days later to Maybach Taniguchi and a debuting Yuji Hino. They got their rematch on January 6, but failed again. However, after Muhammed Yone and Quiet Storm defeated Taniguchi and Hino, Nakajima and Shiozaki challenged the new champions. This led to a match on February 24, which Nakajima and Shiozaki won. Backstage, Nakajima said that his Tag Team with Go Shiozaki has a name, and it is AXIZ. AXIZ made their first successful defense on March 10, against the team of Eddie Edwards and Masa Kitamiya.

Written by Jonathan Moskin and David Mulei and directed by Nick Marck, the episode premiered on The CW on May 15, 2007. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, when a Hearst student and former child soldier in Uganda named Apollo (Nelsan Ellis) publishes a memoir, Veronica receives a phone call from a man claiming to be his father. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Dick (Ryan Hansen) plan to go on a surfing vacation in the summer, coming into conflict with several people. In addition, Piz (Chris Lowell) must decide between two summer internships. \\"I Know What You'll Do Next Summer\\" incorporates the organization Invisible Children, Inc. into its storyline and includes a public service announcement for the group at the end of the episode. Hansen and Bell are celebrity supporters of the organization, and series creator Rob Thomas was inspired to devote an episode to the subject of child soldiers when Hansen gave him a book about Uganda the previous Christmas. In its original broadcast, the episode received 2.10 million viewers and generally positive reviews from television critics, with many praising the character development of Dick and the case-of-the-week.  Synopsis  Veronica and Piz hang out at her house. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) tests Veronica on her upcoming private investigator exam, and Piz states that he is interviewing a former child soldier and Hearst student, Apollo, for his radio show. Keith informs his deputies that a robbery wave has been occurring. Piz interviews the student before telling Veronica that he has been offered an internship by Pitchfork Media. Veronica receives a 95% on the PI exam before being called by a man stating that Apollo is his son. Keith speaks to a suspect in some of the robberies and discovers that he is connected to the Fitzpatricks. Logan meets Parker's (Julie Gonzalo) parents, who are very uptight. Veronica speaks to Apollo, posing as a reporter for the school newspaper, finding that Apollo's mother's handwriting is very similar to the letter his father claimed to have from his mother. Logan tells Parker that he will not be seeing her in the summer because he will be on a surfing trip with Dick. Mac (Tina Majorino) and Max (Adam Rose) spend all their time together. Piz tells Veronica about another internship in Neptune, but she dodges his attempts to ask which one he should take. Keith meets Liam Fitzpatrick (Rod Rowland), who states that the robberies will not stop. Apollo learns that Veronica was not assigned by the school paper, and Veronica tells him the truth, but he refuses a paternity test. Some people begin to grow dissatisfied with Keith's handling of the robberies, while Apollo's father claimant appears in Neptune. Veronica searches for Apollo, learning from his former roommate that Apollo did not actually write the book, and he was never a child soldier. However, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) urges her not to expose him as a hoax, as his book as actually helping charities that aid child soldiers. At the job fair, Wallace is seen signing up for Invisible Children, Inc. Apollo tells Veronica that he actually does want the paternity test. Dick's father, who was involved in a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn't appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that he actually was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn't so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff's office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed. After seeing an ad for Vincent Van Lowe's campaign for sheriff, Veronica gets the news that she has been accepted into the FBI's internship program.  Production  \\"I Know What You'll Do Next Summer\\" was written by Jonathan Moskin and David Mulei and directed by Nick Marck, marking Moskin's third and final writing credit, Mulei's second and final writing credit, and Marck's tenth and final directing credit. The episode contains several references to the charity Invisible Children, Inc., which aims to increase awareness for the use of child soldiers in the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. The episode also ends with a public service announcement delivered by Jason Dohring, Kristen Bell and Ryan Hansen out-of- character. Bell is an active supporter of the organization, while Hansen is the brother-in-law of founder Jason Russell. Series creator Rob Thomas was initially worried about including the reunion between Apollo and Kizza because he thought that such scenes did not play to his strengths as a storyteller. However, he was pleased with the result because of the two actors' performances. The two performers had never met each other prior to this scene, and they were filming within four minutes of setup time. One quip by Vinnie (Ken Marino) about the office's secretaries was a callback to a similar joke in \\"Of Vice and Men\\". Thomas was inspired to focus an episode on a former Ugandan child soldier by two incidents. The first was when he was initially informed about the situation by a former student of his mother's, while at Christmas the previous year, Hansen had given books about Ugandan child soldiers to all the writers. In the episode, Apollo is scheduled to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show; Oprah's Book Club was discussing a book about a child soldier at the time, but this was a coincidence. In the episode, Piz states that he has been given an internship with Pitchfork Media at their headquarters in New York City; however, the location is incorrect.  Reception = Ratings  In its original broadcast, \\"I Know What You'll Do Next Summer\\" received 2.10 million viewers, ranking 87th of 90 in the weekly rankings. This was an increase in roughly 250,000 viewers from the previous episode, \\"Debasement Tapes\\", which earned 1.85 million viewers.  Reviews  The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics, many of whom praised the case-of-the-week and the character development of Dick Casablancas. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating that it was \\"great\\". He lauded the episode's handling of its political subject matter and the return of older storylines. He argued that \\"I Know What You'll Do Next Summer\\" used its political message much better than \\"Un-American Graffiti\\", which aired two weeks prior; he thought that this episode's story made its political message more subtle than the previous episode. The reviewer also enjoyed the development of Dick's character that occurred with the return of his father, stating that the scene in which Dick yelled at his father \\"an excellent moment that helped bring a lot of new shading to the funny, but usually one-note character.\\" Keith's storyline was another center of praise, with the reviewer stating that he thought the Fitzpatricks' plot line had been too rushed earlier in the season. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly was generally positive as well, noting the romantic uncertainty between Veronica and Piz, Logan and Parker, and Mac and Max, drawing parallels between this aspect of the episode and the series' uncertain future. In addition, the reviewer thought highly of Dick's confrontation with his father and the case-of-the-week. Television Without Pity graded the episode a \\"B+\\". In a review written during the success of the film campaign Kony 2012 on the internet, Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club thought that he found himself frequently comparing the episode's treatment of child soldiers with the discussion of Invisible Children at the time. \\"This isn't a bad thing. It's a representation of how television, like any art form, can have multiple meanings, which evolve over time.\\" However, the reviewer knew that Apollo was not going to be a fraud given the cast members' support of the organization. The reviewer also praised Hansen's reaction to his father's return. Kelly West of Cinema Blend wrote that \\"tonight's episode of 'Veronica Mars' was a cornucopia of emotions.\\"  References  External links  * *\\"I Know What You'll Do Next Summer\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 3) episodes ","title":"I Know What You'll Do Next Summer"},{"id":"10059404","text":"View of Rama Cay, Nicaragua Rama Cay is an island in the Bluefields Lagoon on the eastern coast of Nicaragua.

Borthwick, ‚ÄòDouglas, George, fourth earl of Angus (c.1417‚Äì1463)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. was a Scottish nobleman. He was the son of William Douglas, 2nd Earl of Angus and Margaret Hay of Yester. Known as the Great Earl of Angus,https://archive.org/stream/douglasbook02fras#page/119/mode/2up he succeeded to the Earldom following the death of his childless brother James Douglas, 3rd Earl of Angus in 1446. He was to become the first Red Chief of Douglas. Red Douglas and the Stewart connection The chief line of the family were the Earls of Douglas which represented the \\"Black\\" line, whereas Angus represented the \\"Red\\" Line. Both branches were descended through bastardy from William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas. The Earl of Douglas descended through Archibald the Grim, an illegitimate son of Sir James Douglas. The 4th Earl of Angus' grandfather was an illegitimate child of William, 1st Earl of Douglas. Although the representatives of both lines of the House wore the \\"three stars argent\\" and \\"Man's Heart gules\\" on their arms the 4th Earl of Angus and the 8th Earl of Douglas were third cousins. Angus had closer ties with the House of Stewart than his Douglas cousins however, being the great-grandson of Robert III of Scotland through his grandmother Princess Mary of Scotland, Countess of Angus. This was to have major implications in the downfall of the Black Douglases and the rise of the Red line. Douglases united In June 1448, Angus joined with his kinsmen the Earl of Douglas and his brother Hugh Douglas, Earl of Ormonde on a punitive raid into England and despoiled the countryside as far as Alnwick which they burnt and \\"come hame wele\\". This was in response to attacks led by the Earl of Northumberland and Robert Ogle in which they had burnt Dunbar Castle in the east, and by the Earl of Salisbury who had laid waste to Dumfries in the west. The score was evened in July when the Douglases invested Warkworth Castle and \\"did gret scaith\\"Maxwell, Vol II, p14 and the victory over Northumberland at the Battle of Sark. This action in 1448 would be the last time that the two branches of the House of Douglas would act in partnership, and ride together against their hereditary foes of Percy and Neville. In 1449 Angus was made Warden of the Middle Marches. The Douglas Rebellion In 1452 the 8th Earl of Douglas was murdered at Stirling Castle, by his monarch James II while under assurances of safe-conduct. Other notable magnates assisted King James in the act. The whole of Douglasdale rose in rebellion under the late Earl's younger brothers, James the new 9th Earl of Douglas, his twin Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray, and the younger Hugh Douglas, Earl of Ormonde, and John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie. During this time of intermittent internecine strife in Scotland, it might have been expected that Angus would have thrown his lot in with his Douglas cousins. However, relationships between the Black Douglases and the Red Douglases had always been tense. Moreover, as alluded above the ties of kinship between Angus and King James were close, being first cousins within one degree. A magnate as powerful as Angus could not abstain from declaring himself either way. So, when the rebellion began in earnest in early 1455, and the King took to the field against the Douglas brothers, Angus came out in full support of his Monarch, and was given high command within the Royal army. It has been suggested that Angus accompanied the King at the siege of Abercorn. Following the defection of James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton, Douglas' chief lieutenant to the King's side, the Earl of Douglas fled to England in an attempt to gain support from Henry VI of England. Douglas' brothers stayed in Scotland to continue the struggle. The brothers had appeared in force in Annandale and King James sent Angus to deal with them. Angus mustered the Border Clans and encountered the rebels on the 18th of May near Langholm. The ensuing Battle of Arkinholm was a rout for the Douglas brothers, Moray was killed and Ormonde captured (to be executed soon after) and only Balvenie escaped to England. That summer the Black Douglases were attainted and their estates declared forfeit. Angus appended his seal to the charter in token of approval. Ascendancy of the Red Douglas Following the acts of attainder, Angus received the vast fiefdom and superiority of the Lordship of Douglas, obtaining a charter of confirmation in 1457 In 1460, Angus accompanied King James to the siege of Roxburgh Castle, held by the English. The castle, which had been a thorn in the side of successive Scottish monarchs, contained a garrison loyal to the House of York. James had decided to back the House of Lancaster. On the 3rd of August James' queen, Mary of Gueldres, had arrived to inspire enthusiasm amongst the besiegers. Overseeing the cannonade to greet his wife, James stood too close to one of the bombards. When it exploded, it killed him, and wounded Angus, his constant companion. Though wounded, Angus was still able to take command of much of the siege, and the castle was stormed and taken within the week. On the 10th of August, Angus attended the coronation of James III at Kelso Abbey , where he placed the Crown upon the nine-year-old King's head, as was his right as Lord Abernethy. He is supposed to have proclaimed: \\"There! Now that I have set it upon your Grace's head, let me see who will be so bold as to move it.\\"Maxwell Vol II, p.17 Angus had already become enormously powerful during the reign of James II and during the Regency for his son; his power continued to grow. Following the forfeiture of the Black Douglases, the Scots parliament had decreed that no Douglas should have a hereditary right to the wardenship of the Marches, Angus continued to exercise command over the East and Middle Marches, and was appointed lieutenant of the Realm by the Queen-regent Mary of Gueldres. In the following year, Angus spent a great deal of time consolidating his estates, placing trusted vassals in charge of the more far-flung properties. In 1462, he received all of the goods, lands and rents of the adherents of the forfeited Douglases in Roxburghshire, apart from those already owned by his brother William Douglas of Cluny. In the same year, Angus was involved in negotiations with the Lancastrian Henry VI of England. Henry had obtained a bond from Angus to aid him with \\"a stipulated force for the recovery of that realm [England] from Henry's rebels and enemies\\". For Henry's part, he had promised Angus, on the recovery of his kingdom, \\"to make the saide erle sufficiently and suerly after the lawes of England a duke withynne the said reavme of England, with stile, astate, honure and name of a duke.‚Äù The dukedom brought with it a castle and land to the value of 2000 marks.Maxwell Vol II, p.19 Angus was unable to pursue his plans for an English dukedom: He died on 12 March 1463 at Abernethy.

Brood XIII (also known as Brood 13 or Northern Illinois Brood) is one of 15 separate broods of periodical cicadas that appear regularly throughout the midwestern United States. Every 17 years, Brood XIII tunnels en masse to the surface of the ground, lays eggs, and then dies off in several weeks. Although entomologist C. L. Marlatt published an account in 1907 in which he argued for the existence of 30 broods, over the years a number have been consolidated and only 15 are recognized today as being distinct. Brood XIII is among the 12 different broods with 17-year cycles. Its most recent appearance was in the spring and early summer of 2007, throughout an area roughly enclosed by northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin, and a narrow strip of Indiana bordering Lake Michigan and Michigan. It will emerge again in 2024 and 2041. The 4-centimeter long black bugs do not sting or bite. Once they emerge, they spend their short two-week lives climbing trees, shedding their exoskeletons and reproducing. They can number up to a million per hectare. The Northern Illinois brood, which will emerge in late May 2024, has a reputation for the largest emergence of cicadas known anywhere. Ravinia In the northern Chicago suburb of Highland Park, there was a concern about how the cicadas might drown out the music at the Ravinia Festival during May and June, the peak months of cicada activity. According to the Chicago Tribune, Ravinia adjusted the schedule so that Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) concerts took place in July, after the outbreak in 2007. Other concerts before this time could have been moved indoors if the noise of the cicadas would have detracted from the music. However, the dates of all concerts, except those for the CSO, took place as scheduled.  2020 Sub-Brood  Some of the Northern Illinois Sub-Brood (part of Marlatt's XIII) cicadas emerge 4 years early, particularly in the Chicago area in 2020.

Korea‚Äî Seoul Rigged to Look Like North Korea, Goal of Leftist Students\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 1, 1970, p1. Japan's Vice Minister for Transport, Shinjiro Yamamura, had volunteered to take the place of the remaining hostages, and the hijackers accepted \\"Japanese Hijackers Release 100 on Plane\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 3, 1970, p1. They then proceeded to Pyongyang's Mirim Airport, with Yamamura now as hostage, where they surrendered to North Korean authorities, who offered the whole group asylum. The hijackers' motive was to defect to North Korea. Using North Korea as a base, they thought they could promote rebellion in South Korea and elsewhere across East Asia. The plane carrying Vice Minister Yamamura and the remainder of the crew was released two days later and returned to its gate at Haneda Airport at 9:39AM on April 5. Later events The alleged mastermind of the hijacking, who did not take part in the actual operation, was Takaya Shiomi. Shiomi was arrested, convicted, and served almost 20 years in prison in Japan. After his release in 1989, suffering from poor health, Shiomi obtained a lowly paid job as an attendant at a multi-level parking facility in Kiyose, Tokyo, where he was working as late as 2008.Botting, Geoff, \\"From terror to parking cars\\", Japan Times, May 11, 2008, p. 9. He has said that they had intended to go to Cuba via North Korea. He joined an antibase movement in Okinawa and an antinuclear campaign, and wrote several books related to the Red Army Faction. In April 2015, he ran in the city assembly elections in Kiyose, campaigning on an anti-Abe platform and against the city's policies which are \\"bullying\\" the elderly. He died on November 14, 2017 of heart failure at a Tokyo hospital. Moriaki Wakabayashi was an early member (bass player) in the long-running avant-garde rock band Les Rallizes D√©nud√©s. In a March 2010 interview with Kyodo News, Wakabayashi stated that the hijacking was a \\"selfish and conceited\\" act. Wakabayashi added that he wished to return to Japan and was willing to face arrest and trial for his role in the hijacking.Kyodo News, \\"Ex-Red Army Faction Member Says Airplane Hijacking Was 'Selfish'\\", March 31, 2010. In April 2014 he was still alive, and residing in North Korea together with other members of his group. In 1985, Yasuhiro Shibata returned to Japan in secret to raise money for the group, was arrested, and was sentenced to five years in prison. Yoshimi Tanaka was arrested in Thailand with a large amount of counterfeit money and repatriated to Japan in March 2000, where he was sentenced; he died before its completion. However, the other hijackers remain at large, according to Japan's National Police Agency. The leader of the group, Takamaro Tamiya, died in 1995 and Kintaro Yoshida sometime before 1985. Takeshi Okamoto and his wife Kimiko Fukudome were probably killed trying to flee North Korea.. The suspicious deaths of Yoshida and Okamoto are referred to on pages 136 and 137. Her research is based on the journalistic work of Takazawa Koji. Takahiro Konishi, Shiro Akagi, Kimihuro Uomoto and Moriaki Wakabayashi still reside in North Korea; all except Takeshi Okamoto were confirmed to have been alive when they were interviewed by Kyodo News. In June 2004, the remaining hijackers made a request to North Korean authorities that they be allowed to return to Japan, even if they are to be punished for the hijacking. Notable passengers The future Roman Catholic Archbishop and Cardinal Stephen Fumio Hamao was one of the passengers on the flight. Another passenger was Shigeaki Hinohara. Hinohara was one of the world's longest- serving physicians and educators.

The reason this cycle was called \\"futile\\" cycle was because it appeared that this cycle operated with no net utility for the organism. As such, it was thought of being a quirk of the metabolism and thus named a futile cycle. After further investigation it was seen that futile cycles are very important for regulating the concentrations of metabolites. For example, if glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were to be active at the same time, glucose would be converted to pyruvate by glycolysis and then converted back to glucose by gluconeogenesis, with an overall consumption of ATP. Futile cycles may have a role in metabolic regulation, where a futile cycle would be a system oscillating between two states and very sensitive to small changes in the activity of any of the enzymes involved. The cycle does generate heat, and may be used to maintain thermal homeostasis, for example in the brown adipose tissue of young mammals, or to generate heat rapidly, for example in insect flight muscles and in hibernating animals during periodical arousal from torpor. It has been reported that the glucose metabolism substrate cycle is not a futile cycle but a regulatory process. For example, when energy is suddenly needed, ATP is replaced by AMP, a much more reactive adenine. Example The simultaneous carrying out of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is an example of a futile cycle, represented by the following equation: \\\\mathrm{ATP + H_2 O {\\\\rightleftharpoons} ADP + P_i} + H For example, during glycolysis, fructose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1). ATP + fructose-6-phosphate ‚Üí Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + ADP But during gluconeogenesis (i.e. synthesis of glucose from pyruvate and other compounds) the reverse reaction takes place, being catalyzed by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-1). Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + H2O ‚Üí fructose-6-phosphate + Pi Giving an overall reaction of: ATP + H2O ‚Üí ADP + Pi \\\\+ Heat That is, hydrolysis of ATP without any useful metabolic work being done. Clearly, if these two reactions were allowed to proceed simultaneously at a high rate in the same cell, a large amount of chemical energy would be dissipated as heat. This uneconomical process has therefore been called a futile cycle.Nelson, D. L., Lehninger, A. L., & Cox, M. M. (2008). Lehninger principles of biochemistry (5th ed., pp. 582-583). New York: W.H. Freeman.  Futile Cycle's role in Obesity and Homeostasis  There are not many drugs that can effectively treat or reverse obesity. Obesity can increase ones risk of diseases primarily linked to health problems such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and even certain types of cancers. A study revolving around treatment and prevention of obesity using transgenic mice to experiment on reports positive feedback that proposes miR-378 may sure be a promising agent for preventing and treating obesity in humans. The study findings demonstrate that activation of the pyruvate-PEP futile cycle in skeletal muscle through miR-378 is the primary cause of elevated lipolysis in adipose tissues of miR-378 transgenic mice, and it helps orchestrate the crosstalk between muscle and fat to control energy homeostasis in mice. Our general understanding of futile cycle is a substrate cycle, occurring when two overlapping metabolic pathways run in opposite directions, that when left without regulation will continue to go on uncontrolled without any actual production until all the cells energy is depleted. However, the idea behind the study indicates miR-378-activated pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate futile cycle plays a regulatory benefit. Not only does miR-378 result in lower body fat mass due to enhanced lipolysis it is also speculated that futile cycles regulate metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis. miR-378 has a unique function in regulating metabolic communication between the muscle and adipose tissues to control energy homeostasis at whole-body levels.  Examples of futile cycle operating in different species  To understand how presence of a futile cycle helps maintain low levels of ATP and generation heat in some species we look at metabolic pathways dealing with reciprocal regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The swim bladder of many fish; such as zebrafish for example - is an organ internally filled with gas that helps contribute to their buoyancy. These gas gland cell are found to be located where the capillaries and nerves are found. Analyses of metabolic enzymes demonstrated that a gluconeogenesis enzyme fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase (Fbp1) and a glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) are highly expressed in gas gland cells. The study signified that the characterization of the zebrafish swim bladder should not contain any expression fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene. The tissue of the swim bladder is known to be very high in glycogenic activity and lacking in gluconeogenesis, yet a predominant amount of Fbp was found to be expressed. This finding suggests that in the gas gland cell, Fbp forms an ATP-dependent metabolic futile cycle. Generation of heat is critically important for the gas gland cells to synthesize lactic acid because the process is strongly inhibited if ATP is accumulated. Another example suggest that heat generation in fugu swim bladder will be transported out of the site of generation, however it may still be constantly recovered back through the rete mirabile so as to maintain the temperature of the gas gland higher than other areas of the body. _The overall net reaction of the futile cycle involves the consumption of ATP and generation of heat as follows:_ ATP + H2O --> ADP + Pi + Heat Another example of futile cycle benefiting in generation of heat is found in bumble bees. The futile cycle involving Fbp and Pfk is used by bumble bees to produce heat in flight muscles and warm up their bodies considerably at low ambient temperatures.

Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds, 1772? The Streatham Worthies is the collective description for the circle of literary and cultural figures around the wealthy brewer Henry Thrale and his wife Hester Thrale who assembled at his country retreat Streatham Park and were commemorated by a series of portraits by Joshua Reynolds. Reynolds painted these portraits over the course of about ten years. As well as the twelve bust-length male portraits, Reynolds also painted a double portrait of Thrale's wife Hester, and their daughter Hester Maria, nicknamed 'Queeney'. The usage the 'Streatham Worthies' was first coined by the novelist Fanny Burney to describe the portraits. It is generally believed to be a playful reference to the celebrated 'Temple of British Worthies' at Stowe House. The portraits were hung above the bookshelves in the library at Streatham Park. Burney noted that Thrale wanted: :\\"the persons he most loved to contemplate‚Ä¶ to preside over the literature that stood highest in his estimation\\". Charles Burney, 1781 The members of the Worthies were: *Oliver Goldsmith - Irish novelist and playwright, :This c.1772 portrait is now in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin *Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti literary critic and translator. :This 1773 portrait is now in a Private Collection *Edmund Burke - philosopher :This 1774 portrait is now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh *Joshua Reynolds - painter :Reynold's 1775 self portrait is now in at Tate Britain *Samuel Johnson - author and lexicographer :This portrait, perhaps of 1772 (before 1778 in any case), is also now at Tate Britain *Charles Burney - composer and music historian :This 1781 portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery, London *David Garrick - actor :This 1775 portrait is now in the Hyde Collection at Houghton Library, Harvard University. *Arthur Murphy *Edwin Sandys *William Henry Lyttelton *Sir Robert Chambers - jurist and judge *Henry Thrale himself :This 1777 portrait is now in the Hyde Collection at Houghton Library, Harvard University. The double portrait of Hester Thrale and eldest daughter Hester Maria Thrale is also normally regarded as part of the set. This 1777-8 portrait is in the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, New Brunswick. The portraits were dispersed on the sale of the contents of Streatham Park in 1816. In 2005 the first six portraits of the worthies as listed above were reunited in a single room with Reynold's portrait of Mrs Thrale and Hester Maria for the Tate Britain exhibition Joshua Reynolds - The Creation of Celebrity. Mrs Thrale wrote that Sir Philip Jennings-Clerke had pressed her to include him in the list of Worthies.

Alexeyev was an accomplished designer of hydrofoil ships, such as the Raketa, and became a prominent developer of ground effect vehicles, particularly the Caspian Sea Monster and the A-90 Orlyonok. Biography Rostislav Evgenievich Alexeyev was born on December 18, 1916, in Novozybkov, Chernigov Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Bryansk Oblast, Russia) to an agronomist father and a teacher mother. In 1933 his family moved to Gorky, and in 1935 enrolled in a shipbuilding course at the Gorky Industrial Institute. Alexeyev graduated on October 1, 1941, after successfully defending his final thesis on hydrofoils, and was awarded the title of engineer-shipbuilder. He was sent to work at the Red Sormovo shipbuilding factory, but the entry of the Soviet Union into World War II following the German invasion of the Soviet Union earlier that year meant the factory was instead manufacturing tanks for the war effort rather than ships. Hydrofoils Alexeyev initially served as a foreman for tank production, but in 1942 was reallocated by the Soviet Navy to developing hydrofoils for combat use. His designs were not completed by the end of the war in 1945, but the Soviet government maintained interest in them and 340 hydrofoil vessels had been planned by the late 1940s. Alexeyev continued working on hydrofoils and became chief designer of the Raketa, the first passenger hydrofoil commercially produced in the Soviet Union, which began production in 1957. The Raketa was presented at the International Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow that year, and interest in hydrofoils grew even further. Alexeyev was chief designer for numerous passenger hydrofoil designs produced at Red Sormovo, including the Meteor, the Kometa, the Sputnik, the Burevestnik, and the Sunrise. Ground effect vehicles A-90 Orlyonok (\\"Eaglet\\") in Moscow. In 1962, Alexeyev began working at the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau which specialized in the secret development of ground effect vehicles, named ekranoplans. In the 1950s the Soviet Union saw a great interest in ground effect vehicles, which at the time were largely ignored by the rest of the world, and had been developing them at a rapid pace. Ground effect vehicles were technically aircraft, but operated using ground effect to travel only several meters above flatter surfaces, particularly bodies of water, leading them to be classified as ships by the Soviet government. The Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau planned a massive ekranoplan utilizing the \\"Wing In Ground\\" (WIG) effect, and Alexeyev was invited to participate in development due to his expertise with hydrofoils. Only two years after development began the project resulted in the Korabl Maket (KM), better known in English as the Caspian Sea Monster, with Alexeyev as the chief designer and V. Efimov as the lead engineer. When the KM's functioning prototype of the project was completed in 1966, it was largest and heaviest aircraft in the world, but as it was a secret project at the time this benchmark was unknown to the world. It was powered by eight Dobrynin VD-7 turbojet engines on the front of the fuselage, and two on the tail for extra thrust during takeoff.KM Specifications The KM was produced at the Red Sormovo factory in Gorky, then secretly transported along the Volga river to Kaspiysk, where it would be stationed to undergo testing by the Soviet Navy in the Caspian Sea operated by test pilots of the Soviet Air Force. On its first flight on October 16, 1966, the KM was co-piloted by Alexeyev himself, which was unusual as aircraft designers never normally operated their own creations. The KM was at first seen as a promising vehicle specialized for use by military and rescue workers but its design caused many difficulties, progress slowed and Alexeyev quickly moved on to other ekranoplan projects. The most successful project was the A-90 Orlyonok, which made its first flight in 1972, and was commissioned by the Soviet Navy in 1979. The Orlyonok saw limited use as a military transport vehicle, and three of the five units produced were in active service until 1993. Death Monument of Rostislav Alexeyev in Nizhny Novgorod, Bugrovskoye cemetery On January 14, 1980, Alexeyev was injured in an air crash that occurred while testing a new ekranoplan to be presented at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The vehicle lost lift and lowered into the water at high speed, and immediately after the accident Alexeyev was removed as chief designer at the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau and was hospitalized three days later. Alexeyev died on February 9, 1980, following two operations. Alexeyev received numerous prestigious awards, including the Stalin Prize second degree in 1951, the Lenin Prize in 1962, the USSR State Prize in 1984, the Order of the October Revolution, the Order of the Badge of Honour, and the Honoured Inventor of the RSFSR. The KM crashed in 1980 shortly after Alexeyev's death due to pilot error, and the project was subsequently cancelled but was used as a foundation for the Lun-class ekranoplan. After the fall of the Soviet Union development of ekranoplans was almost totally ended, but the details of Alexeyev's work became known to the general public and generated a lot of interest, and he is now generally considered as a father of the ground effect vehicle.

Customers also have access to Consumer Reports (website) and a series of research databases for homework and college prep, genealogy services, health information and more. History Maricopa County started a free library system the day after the stock market crash in 1929. The enormous population increases in the 1960s and 1970s led the County Library System to undergo reorganization to meet the demands of the residents. In 1986 the State Legislature passed a bill allowing Arizona counties to establish library districts. In 1987 the County Board of Supervisors voted to form the Maricopa County Library District (separate governmental and tax entities). The County Board of Supervisors serves as the District's Board of Library Directors. In 2007, the Maricopa County Library District opened Perry Library, which abandoned the traditional Dewey Decimal System in favor of categorical shelving (i.e., Shelf Logic). Their Sun City Library moved to Shelf Logic in 2009 as did its Gila Bend (2012) North Valley Regional and El Mirage Libraries in 2013. During fiscal year 2007-08, the library district welcomed more than 3 million customers and loaned more than 5 million units of materials. November 2008‚ÄîThe Queen Creek Branch Library opened a new building, expandable to . March 2009‚ÄîThe Goodyear Branch Library opened in temporary quarters in the Goodyear City Hall. May 2009‚ÄîThe Library District took over the once privately held Sun City Bell Branch Library and renamed it the Sun City Branch Library. In 2014, the Library District began offering digital content to its customers. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors voted to eliminate overdue fines at County Libraries on May 22, 2019. Awards and recognition The Library District has received national awards for its programs and technology. In 2005 MCLD was awarded the John Cotton Dana Library Public Relations Award for The Mystery Club of Luna Drive, an original online serial novel. The library district was awarded the Pioneer Award for Quality by The Arizona Quality Alliance in 2006. In 2006 the district turned the book Tom√°s and the Library Lady by Pat Mora into a world premiere stage play adapted and performed by a professional children's theater company that toured schools and reached over 70,000 children. First Lady Laura Bush saw the play on invitation from the district. The theater company toured it nationally in 2007. In 2009, the library district received the National Book Foundation‚ÄîInnovation in Reading Prize for developing innovative means for creating and sustaining a lifelong love of reading ‚Äî awarded to the District for its \\"Dewey-less\\" libraries.

This is a category because the composition of two Cp maps is again continuous and of class Cp. One is often interested only in Cp-manifolds modeled on spaces in a fixed category A, and the category of such manifolds is denoted Manp(A). Similarly, the category of Cp-manifolds modeled on a fixed space E is denoted Manp(E). One may also speak of the category of smooth manifolds, Man‚àû, or the category of analytic manifolds, Manœâ. Manp is a concrete category Like many categories, the category Manp is a concrete category, meaning its objects are sets with additional structure (i.e. a topology and an equivalence class of atlases of charts defining a Cp-differentiable structure) and its morphisms are functions preserving this structure. There is a natural forgetful functor :U : Manp -> Top to the category of topological spaces which assigns to each manifold the underlying topological space and to each p-times continuously differentiable function the underlying continuous function of topological spaces. Similarly, there is a natural forgetful functor :U‚Ä≤ : Manp -> Set to the category of sets which assigns to each manifold the underlying set and to each p-times continuously differentiable function the underlying function.  Pointed manifolds and the tangent space functor  It is often convenient or necessary to work with the category of manifolds along with a distinguished point: Man‚Ä¢p analogous to Top‚Ä¢ \\\\- the category of pointed spaces. The objects of Man‚Ä¢p are pairs (M, p_0), where M is a C^pmanifold along with a basepoint p_0 \\\\in M , and its morphisms are basepoint-preserving p-times continuously differentiable maps: e.g. F: (M,p_0) \\\\to (N,q_0), such that F(p_0) = q_0. The category of pointed manifolds is an example of a comma category - Man‚Ä¢p is exactly \\\\scriptstyle {(\\\\bull \\\\downarrow \\\\mathbf{Man^p})}, where \\\\bull represents an arbitrary singleton set, and the \\\\downarrowrepresents a map from that singleton to an element of Manp, picking out a basepoint. The tangent space construction can be viewed as a functor from Man‚Ä¢p to VectR as follows: given pointed manifolds (M, p_0)and (N, F(p_0)), with a C^pmap F: (M,p_0) \\\\to (N,F(p_0)) between them, we can assign the vector spaces T_{p_0}Mand T_{F(p_0)}N, with a linear map between them given by the pushforward (differential): F_{*,p}:T_{p_0}M \\\\to T_{F(p_0)}N.

Golf course The club was founded in 1925 as a nine- hole golf course on the Locust Hill farm of Frank Zornow in the Town of Henrietta, bordering the Town of Pittsford. In 1927, members purchased the Brei Farm on the south side of Jefferson Road in Pittsford, and it reopened as an 18-hole course in 1931. This par 72 (35, 37) course is one of the country's top courses, along with Rochester's Oak Hill Country Club, and Country Club of Rochester. Despite being a relatively short course at , it has proven to be difficult year after year with tight fairways and tough greens. The course rating is 72.8 with a slope rating of 138. In 1966, a charity event was held at LHCC in which RDGA members played with stars such as Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. Nicklaus drove the green on a par 4 and two-putted for birdie, while Palmer holed out for eagle on the eighth hole. Both stated their love for the course after their rounds. LPGA From 1977 to 2009, Locust Hill CC was the host of the annual Wegmans LPGA tournament, one of the most popular annual events on the LPGA Tour. The tournament was formerly known as the Bankers Trust Classic (1977‚Äì78), Sarah Coventry (1979‚Äì81), Rochester International (1982‚Äì97), Wegmans Rochester International (1998‚Äì2001) and Wegmans Rochester LPGA (2002‚Äì05). Locust Hill was the site of Nancy Lopez's fifth consecutive LPGA tournament victory in 1978, a record-setting performance. From 2010 to 2013, it hosted the LPGA Championship in June, one of the four major championships. The 2010 title was won by Cristie Kerr at 269 (‚àí19), a dozen strokes ahead of the field. In 2011, Yani Tseng won by ten strokes, again at 269 (‚Äì19). With longer rough in 2012, Shanshan Feng won her first event on tour by two strokes with a 282 (‚Äì6).

It has a mixed population of Muslims and Christians. It is one of the most religiously diverse areas of the city, and is one of the two major districts of the Christian community in Baghdad, along with Dora. All of the Christians of the district congregate in Inner Karrada, where most of the Churches are located, with congregations of Chaldeans, Assyrians, Melkite Greeks, and Armenian Catholics. It has two sub-districts, being Nazaith and Masbah. Karrada is on the northern part of the peninsula, which was created by a sharp turn in the Tigris river. As a result, the district has much waterfront property, making it a desirable and expensive district. The district of Karrada has had multiple terrorist attacks over the years, which occurred in part to the presence of its large Christian population and wealth. The area is relatively free from sectarianism otherwise, with the actual people of the district coexisting quite well. The airline Al-Naser Airlines has its head office in Karrada, in an area next to Al Jadirya Private Hospital.\\"Contact Us .\\" Al-Naser Airlines.

Other districts on the peninsula Karrada shares the peninsula with Al-Jadriya district. It is a small district which lies at the southern tip of the peninsula, where the Tigris river makes its major turn and heads to the north-east. Its significance comes from its quality of life, and its real estate is, along with Karrada, some of the most expensive in Baghdad. The design and building of the University of Baghdad Campus in 1958 also added to its value since the University has become one of the most important locations in the city, and its campus takes up the entire right half of the district. The University of Baghdad campus was designed by Walter Gropius, AIA, Louis Mcmillen and Robert McMillan of The Architects Collaborative. There is one subdistrict of the city: Babil, likely named for the Babylon hotel that has its location in the district.

Only Windows Media, JPEG, and MP3 formats are supported. WMS is the successor of NetShow Services. In addition to streaming, WMS also has the ability to cache and record streams, enforce authentication, impose various connection limits, restrict access, use multiple protocols, generate usage statistics, and apply forward error correction (FEC). It can also handle a high number of concurrent connections making it suitable for content providers. Streams can also be distributed between servers as part of a distribution network where each server ultimately feeds a different network/audience. Both unicast and multicast streams are supported (multicast streams also use a proprietary and partially encrypted Windows Media Station (*.nsc) file for use by a player.) Typically, Windows Media Player is used to decode and watch/listen to the streams, but other players are also capable of playing unencrypted Windows Media content (Microsoft Silverlight, VLC, MPlayer, etc.) 64-bit versions of Windows Media Services are also available for increased scalability. The Scalable Networking Pack for Windows Server 2003 adds support for network acceleration and hardware-based offloading, which boosts Windows Media server performance. The newest version, Windows Media Services 2008, for Windows Server 2008, includes a built-in WMS Cache/Proxy plug-in which can be used to configure a Windows Media server either as a cache/proxy server or as a reverse proxy server so that it can provide caching and proxy support to other Windows Media servers.

She was built as Iris for service on the River Mersey. In 1918 she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy for action during the Zeebrugge Raid. She was renamed Royal Iris in recognition of her part in this action and returned to civilian duties. She was sold in 1931 and renamed Blarney in 1946. She was scrapped in December 1961. History=Pre war Iris was built by Robert Stephenson & Sons of Newcastle. She was launched in 1906 and completed in June 1906. She was put into service as one of the Mersey ferries operating between Liverpool and Wallasey. Zeebrugge Raid In 1918 Iris was requisitioned by the Royal Navy to take part in the Zeebrugge Raid, being renamed HMS Iris II. On St George's Day 23 April 1918, Iris along with another Mersey ferry, Daffodil, was towed across the English Channel to Zeebrugge by . Embarked were four platoons - known as \\"A\\" Company (or \\"The Chatham Company\\") of the Fourth Battalion of Royal Marines, and a storming party of sailors - known as \\"D\\" Company - commanded by Major Eagles and Lieutenant Commander George Nicholson Bradford respectively. They were supported by two Vickers machine-gun sections and two Stokes mortar crews. When the ship neared the Zeebrugge Mole she cast the two ferries aside. Iris endeavoured to pull up to the mole under heavy fire in order to off-load the raiding parties which were on board. The first attempt failed as the grapple-hooks were not large enough. Two naval officers, Lieutenant Commander Bradford and Lieutenant Hawkings bravely climbed ashore and under heavy fire attempted to secure the ship. Both were killed and Bradford received a posthumous Victoria Cross. Iris continued to sustain heavy fire and at one point a shell burst through the deck into an area where 56 marines were preparing to land. 49 were killed and the rest seriously injured. After the war, a brass plaque, listing those who died aboard the Iris was mounted on the vessel. When she was decommissioned, the plaque was given to the Imperial War Museum collection. Return to Liverpool Iris and Daffodil returned to the Mersey on 17 May 1918, to a heroes' welcome. After repairs at Chatham, both vessels returned to service on the Mersey. Post war After the raid, she was renamed Royal Iris on command of King George V and returned to the Mersey. In 1923 she was converted for use as a cruise ship, and in October 1931 she was sold to Palmer's of Dublin. In 1946 she was sold again, to the Cork Harbour Commissioners, and renamed Blarney. She was eventually sold for scrap at Passage West in December 1961.

Although the bridges cross over the Missouri River, they do not cross the county line. When the Missouri River was rerouted in 1949, it cut across the northern part of Jackson County, Missouri. This left part of the county north of the river, which is known as River Bend. The original Liberty Bend Bridge was located about two miles to the north, which then crossed over into Clay County, Missouri. The main span length is 460.1 feet and the total length is 1,883.3 feet. Vertical clearance is 16.5 feet. History The original Liberty Bend Bridge was built in 1927 and was dismantled in 1973. After the new river channel was cut and the new bridge built over it in 1949, the old bridge continued to carry traffic from the bottoms up to Arsenal Hill, spanning the old riverbed and also crossing the railroad tracks. The then 291, now Southview Dr, continued north. In the early 1970s, the new four-lane divided 291 was built along the east side of the old highway, and the new Independence-Liberty Bridge (the pair of bridges now carrying 291 across the railroad) was built alongside the old Liberty Bend Bridge. It was then, that the old bridge was torn down. Northbound The northbound bridge was built 1949 (with the rerouting, and new channel of the Missouri River) and rehabilitated 1986. With the completion of the new bridge (southbound), all traffic was moved over to the new span. Work immediately began on the northbound bridge during the years 2001‚Äì05. The bridge was rehabilitated once again, and deck was completely removed and replaced. The northbound bridge reopened in 2005. The northbound deck is 23.9 feet wide. Southbound The southbound bridge was started in 1996, completed and opened in 2001 with a deck width of 40 feet. July 2009 Emergency Closure On July 7, 2009, a routine inspection revealed serious problems with the northbound bridge. MoDOT immediately closed the span indefinitely. In a few days a temporary (permanent/paved) crossover was constructed, allowing the rerouting of northbound traffic to share the southbound bridge while repairs were completed. The span opened for traffic in September 2009.http://libertytribune.com/200907074553/breaking-news/breaking- news/northbound-missouri-highway-291-bridge-closed.html See also *List of crossings of the Missouri River References *Bridgehunter.com profile Category:Bridges in Kansas City, Missouri Category:Bridges completed in 1949 Category:Bridges completed in 2001 Category:Buildings and structures in Clay County, Missouri Category:Buildings and structures in Jackson County, Missouri Category:Road bridges in Missouri Category:U.S. Route 71 Category:Steel bridges in the United States ","title":"Liberty Bend Bridge"},{"id":"10060163","text":"The MP3 Party was a British political party founded in 2002 that promised to \\"delete one regulation per day, one law per week, one subsidy per month and one tax per year\\".Manifesto of MP3 PARTY This was based on the idea that when social, legal and administrative systems reach a certain level of complexity they cease functioning.

Born Maung Shwe Waing and later Badon Min, he was the fourth son of Alaungpaya, founder of the dynasty and the Third Burmese Empire. He was proclaimed king after deposing his nephew Phaungkaza Maung Maung, son of his oldest brother Naungdawgyi, at Ava. Bodawpaya moved the royal capital back to Amarapura in 1782. He was titled Hsinbyumyashin (Lord of the White Elephants), although he became known to posterity as Bodawpaya in relation to his successor, his grandson Bagyidaw (Royal Elder Uncle), who in turn was given this name in relation to his nephew Mindon Min. He fathered 62 sons and 58 daughters by about 200 consorts. Military expeditions Depiction of King Bodawpaya at the Amarapura palace in 1795 (British Embassy of Michael Symes). Also known as Bodaw U Waing, he invaded Arakan in 1784 sending his royal armies led by his son, the Heir Apparent Thado Minsaw, across the Western Yoma range of mountains. The capital of Arakan Mrauk U was captured on the last of 1784. The Mahamuni Buddha image, among other treasures such as the Khmer bronze statues, were brought back to mainland Burma; these can still be seen in Mandalay. Also taken were 20,000 captives as slaves to pagodas and temples, and the nobility at Amarapura. Once Arakan was annexed as a province of Burma, her borders became contiguous with British India. The Arakanese revolted in 1794, and the British Governor of India Sir John Shore (later Lord Teignmouth) sent Captain Michael Symes on an embassy, fully equipped to gather as much information as possible about the country, to the Court of Ava as the kingdom was still known to the outside world. Bodawpaya invaded Siam in 1785, and was defeated. The Governor of Tavoy revolted in 1791 with the aid of the Siamese, but a punitive expedition sent by Bodawpaya by sea laid siege ending in peace negotiations in 1793 and the ceding of the Tenasserim coast to the Burmese. He invaded Siam again in 1809, but was fended off by Maha Senanurak and the heroines, Chan and Mook. In 1816, the Ahom governor of Guwahati in Assam, Badan Chandra Borphukan visited the court of Bodawpaya to seek help in order to defeat his political rival Purnananda Burhagohain, the Prime Minister of Ahom Kingdom in Assam. A strong force of 16,000 under the command of Gen. Maha Minhla Minkhaung was sent with Badan Chandra Borphukan. The Burmese force entered Assam in January, 1817 and defeated the Assamese force in the battle of Ghiladhari. Meanwhile, Purnananda Burhagohain died, and Ruchinath Burhagohain, the son of Purnananda Burahgohain fled to Guwahati. The reigning Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha came in terms with Badan Chandra Borphukan and his Burmese allies. The King appointed Badan Chandra Borphukan as Mantri Phukan (Prime Minister) and an Ahom princess Hemo Aideo was given for marriage to Burmese King Bodawpaya along with many gifts. The Burmese force retired from Assam soon after. A year later, Badan Chandra Borphukan was assassinated and the Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha was deposed by rival political faction led by Ruchinath Burhagohain, the son of Purnananda Burhagohain . Chandrakanta Singha and the friends of Badan Chandra Borphukan appeal for help to Bodawpaya. In February 1819, the Burmese forces invaded Assam for second time and reinstalled Chandrakanta Singha on the throne of Assam.E. A. Gait 1926 A History of Assam: 225‚Äì227Dr. S.K.

A statue of Badon Min (Bodawpaya) in the Mahamuni Buddha Temple in Mandalay Bodawpaya proclaimed himself the next messianic Buddha or Maitreya (Arimittya), but his claim was firmly rejected by the Sangha. During his reign, scholarship flourished due to the discipline and stability achieved by establishing a chapter of Sangharajas or senior monks charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the purity of the Sangha. He had successfully arbitrated in favour of orthodoxy to cover both shoulders on the alms round in the controversy concerning the correct way of wearing the robes, and the Order of Monks was unified under the Thudhamma order. Burma became the custodian of Buddhism in the region, and the upasampada ordination was re-introduced to Sri Lanka where it established the Amarapura Nikaya. The unfinished Mantalagyi Stupa, intended to be the largest stupa in the world In 1790 Bodawpaya began the construction of a gigantic stupa called Mantalagyi (Great Royal Stupa) at Mingun, up the River Irrawaddy from Mandalay on the west bank. It was however never finished after a prophecy went round saying Payagyi l√® apyi that, moksoe thonnya kap ‚Äì \\"Once the great pagoda has been wrought, the Moksoe dynasty will come to nought\\" (). It was meant to have stood , tall enough to be seen from Shwebo in the west, the birthplace of the dynasty, towering above the Minwun Hills. An earthquake in 1838 left huge fissures in the structure, and also caused the heads of the two gigantic chinthes to fall into the river. There was also a gigantic 90 ton bell dedicated to the stupa called the Mingun Bell, cast between 1808 and 1810. It was the largest ringing bell in the world, as the larger bell in Moscow Kremlin called the Tsar bell is broken, until the larger Bell of Good Luck was cast and first rung for the new year in 2000. During his reign Bodawpaya also proved to be a great patron of the performing arts; he appointed a minister called Thabin Wun (), and established strict regulations by royal decree ( a meint daw). He also ordered a major economic survey of the kingdom in 1784. Bodawpaya was succeeded after his death in 1819 by his grandson, Prince of Sagaing, who later became known as Bagyidaw.

The team is member of the Texas League, and serves as the Double-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. The Naturals play at Arvest Ballpark, which opened in 2008 and is located at the intersection of Gene George Boulevard and Watkins Avenue. The team relocated from Wichita, Kansas, in 2008, where they were known as the Wichita Wranglers. Origin The Wichita Wranglers had struggled with low attendance numbers and an aging Lawrence‚ÄìDumont Stadium throughout Bob Rich Jr.'s 18-year ownership of the team. In 2006, he sought a move to Springdale, contingent on a citizen vote to approve financing for a new stadium. The pro-baseball movement in Springdale had counted on the support of Ronnie Floyd, influential pastor of local megachurch First Baptist Church of Springdale. In June 2006, Floyd abruptly pulled his support after he discovered that the team would serve alcohol at games,NWAnews.com :: Northwest Arkansas' News Source making professional baseball a contentious and evenly split issue in Northwest Arkansas. The July vote on a measure to extend a one-cent sales tax to raise $50 million for the stadium passed by only 15 votes.NWAnews.com :: Northwest Arkansas' News Source Team name The team's nickname plays off the state's nickname as the \\"Natural State,\\" as well as the Robert Redford film, The Natural. The Rich Family owes much of its baseball success to the film. In 1983, Bob Rich Jr. bought the Double-A Buffalo Bisons, who had suffered low attendance the previous season, for $100,000. That year, Hollywood producers approached Rich about filming scenes for The Natural at Buffalo's War Memorial Stadium. Following the release of the film, local interest in the team rose and attendance at the Bisons' games nearly tripled. Rich was then able to finance the Bisons' move to the Triple-A American Association. In something of a coincidence, the Triple-A Bisons were formerly the Wichita Aeros, meaning Rich has purchased two teams that had played previously in Wichita, Kansas. The \\"Naturals\\" name was chosen after receiving 33 percent of the votes in an online fan poll, beating the second-place choice, \\"Thunder Chickens,\\" by six percent.NWAnews.com :: Northwest Arkansas' News Source The \\"Thunder Chickens\\" moniker was a nod to Springdale-based Tyson Foods, which is the nation's largest supplier of poultry products, and to the region's poultry industry.
