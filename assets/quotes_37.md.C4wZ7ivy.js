History Developed in the early 2000s, following the work of the Camborne and University of Cornwall Support Group (a pressure group that is composed mostly of Cornish graduates), professionals founded the CUC in 1997 to seek a collaboration of all HE providers in Cornwall in working towards the establishment of a free-standing Cornish university in the future and to oppose the loss of the Camborne School of Mines from the depressed towns, Camborne and Redruth. With funds from the European Union Objective One and the South West Regional Development Agency, the CUC serves to fight the \\"brain drain\\" of students to the rest of the United Kingdom. Historically, most Cornish students have had to leave the county to obtain higher education, and they then never returned to contribute their knowledge and skills to the Cornish economy. The establishment of CUC is itself a contribution to the expansion of the Cornish economy, and all proposed developments within the CUC umbrella are required to show how they will contribute to Cornish prosperity. Like a number of other recent projects in UK higher education, CUC involves collaboration between several institutions, but it is probably unique in the number and range of institutions involved. It is conceived on a \\"hub and spokes\\" model, with different institutions offering different kinds of provision in different locations.

Halls of residence are provided, and the campus attracts students on a national and international basis, though it is also intended to be attractive to local students. The second hub is the \\"health spa\\" at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Treliske site, which provides facilities for the Peninsula Medical School (a joint operation of the University of Exeter, the University of Plymouth, and the National Health Service in Devon and Cornwall), and for the Institute of Health Studies of the University of Plymouth, which teaches nursing and other subjects allied to medicine.

It has a rodlike neck, a hollow wooden soundbox, and two silk strings, and is held vertically on the knee of the performer and played with a bow. It is also popularly known as (), (), or (). The haegeum is one of the most widely used instruments in Korean music. The haegeum is used in court music as well as (ordinary people's music). The haegeum's range of expression is various despite having only two strings, with sounds ranging from sorrowful and sad to humorous. The haegeum is made using eight materials: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, hide, and wood, and so it is called (eight sounds). Jung Su-nyun playing The () is a modernized fiddle with four strings, used only in North Korea and in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China.photo The haegeum is a Korean musical instrument played with a wooden bow between two strings, standing in line with a large wooden block standing vertically on top of the ring box. The haegeum is a string instrument, but it is classified as a wind instrument rather than a string at the concert. In traditional Korean music, the string instrument refers to an expression instrument that can not be played properly like a or , and the string instrument that can be used to make a continuous bow like a haegeum or is similar to a wind instrument.  History  There are no records about the exact era when the haegeum was first introduced in Korea. According to several sources, references to the haegeum can be found in (the unrhymed verse and songs of the royal scholars) made in the Goryeo dynasty, so it can be inferred that the haegeum has been played at least since then. In the Joseon Dynasty, the haegeum was used in various music: that of roifoidgdxijohdbox The way the haegeum is played changed dramatically since the Joseon Dynasty. Before middle Joseon period, musicians played the string in method (placing and stopping with no pulling on strings like western bowed-string instrument), but since then they have begun to play in method (pulling the string). Accordingly, it is possible to make a wide variety of sounds by pulling and releasing strings since it has no fingerboard. To improve the acoustic ability of the haegeum, various modifications have been introduced since the 1960s. In 1965, Park Hun-bong and Kim Bun-gi developed a low-tune Haegeum, and in 1967 Kim Gisu made a small haegeum.Ïû•ÏïÖÏõê, Ïö∞Ï£ºÏùò ÏÑ†Ïú®ÏùÑ Îã¥Îã§, ÏÜ°ÏßÄÏõê ÏßÄÏùå See also *Erhu *Huqin *Korean music *Traditional Korean musical instruments  References  External links  *Haegum photo *Traditional Korean Instruments Category:Korean musical instruments Category:Huqin family instruments ","title":"Haegeum"},{"id":"3759292","text":"Please Teach Me English (; lit. \\"The Complete Mastering of English\\") is a 2003 South Korean comedy about a young woman who begins English lessons after she is unable to help a foreigner at her government office. Synopsis Park Mun- su (Jang Hyuk) and Na Young-ju (Lee Na-young) are classmates in a private English class. Mun-su frequently chases women while working in his shoe shop. However, Young-ju has an unreciprocated interest in him. They eventually become friends, and frequently sit together in class. One day, Young-ju boasts about a pig on her grandparents' farm who can recognize the English alphabet. The class decide to visit the pig, only to discover it has been eaten the same day and Young-ju just invented the whole story. Young-ju tries to train a piglet to recognize the alphabet; and when Mun-su finds out about her efforts, he tries to help her. However, the pig escapes, and has to be recaptured. The class and Young-ju's family have a party that night. One day, while riding the bus, Young-ju catches Mun-su showing the photo of a woman who she mistakenly believes to be his girlfriend. Discouraged by this, Young-ju skips English classes. Her teacher, an Australian woman, tries to convince her to return to the classes. Young-ju attends a farewell party for the class, but Mun-su is not there. Afterwards she meets Mun-su's mother, who is looking for him. She discovers that his mother is about to meet the girl in the photo. The girl, known as Victoria or Mun-young, speaks no Korean and needs Young-ju to translate. Dressed in a hanbok, Mun-su's mother and talking to Victoria, Young-ju, who thinks Victoria is her rival, purposefully translates incorrectly telling Victoria; \\"You looked more beautiful in the photo.\\" Victoria is astonished. Young-ju tells Victoria that everybody hates her because she is not Korean. Victoria asks her to tell Mun-su's mother that she came with good intentions and leaves. Mun-su arrives to find his mother weeping. Young-ju hides. Victoria has checked out of the hotel, but Young-ju stops her car, and admits that she lied. Victoria reunites with Mun-su and his mother. Ashamed, Young-ju boards a train but Mun-su follows her, leaving his family behind. She tries to hide from him, but Mun-su finds Young-ju, loudly confessing to her that Victoria is not his girlfriend, but his long-lost sister from New York. They make up, kissing in the train, with the entire train cheering them on. They marry and have a baby.

It is a loose remake of George A. Romero's 1985 film of the same name, the third in Romero's Dead series, and it is the first of two remakes of the original 1985 film; the other is Day of the Dead: Bloodline (2018). The 2008 film was directed by Steve Miner and written by Jeffrey Reddick. Day of the Dead (2008) was principally shot in Bulgaria, with limited shooting in Los Angeles, California. Tyler Bates provided the soundtrack, and screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick has a cameo appearance as an ill-fated police officer.  Plot  In May 2008, in Leadville, Colorado, Trevor and his girlfriend, Nina, have a romantic encounter in an abandoned building. As they return to their respective parents' homes, they encounter a military roadblock. An angry man demands medical care for his child, revealing an outbreak has occurred. The teens meet Captain Rhodes and Corporal Sarah Cross, Trevor‚Äôs sister. Soon afterward, Privates Bud Crain and Salazar show up, and Bud immediately falls in love with Sarah. Sarah and Bud visit her sick mother, and she visits her brother, Trevor. Sarah also visits Trevor's friend, Kyle, after she learns his symptoms are similar to her mother's. When Bud and Sarah arrive at Kyle's house, they find the mauled bodies of his parents stashed behind a curtain and Kyle missing. They radio Captain Rhodes and take Nina, Trevor, and their mother to the local hospital. There, Sarah talks to Dr. Logan at the urging of Rhodes, while out in the waiting room all the infected become catatonic. Bud runs to alert Sarah when all the infected suddenly reanimate. They turn into zombies, transforming while catatonic. They have superhuman strength that allows them to run, jump long distances, and crawl on the ceiling. Nina and Trevor escape, seeking refuge in the local radio station. Captain Rhodes fights off the zombies before perishing. After becoming trapped in a storage room, Sarah, Dr. Logan, and Bud crawl through ceiling ducts into another room, where they find Salazar. Uninfected, he returns with them through the ducts to the storage room. The transformed Rhodes, also in the room, pursues them through the duct and nearly catches up with Sarah. Although she escapes, Rhodes bites Bud's hand as Bud replaces the ceiling grill. After dispatching Rhodes, the four escape from the hospital by jumping from the storeroom window into the car park, which is overrun with zombies. Here, they discover the zombies can be killed by shooting them in the head or setting them on fire. In the confusion, Dr. Logan deliberately pushes a non-infected girl into the path of the zombies and escapes in an abandoned vehicle. Sarah, Bud, and Salazar win their battle with the zombies and drive away in a military vehicle. They make a stop at the gun store while Bud stays in the vehicle. When Sarah and Salazar return they find Bud has transformed. Instead of killing him, Sarah insists they take him with them, because Bud is restrained by plastic wrist- ties and poses no threat. Sarah and Salazar hear Trevor call for help on the radio and go to the radio station to rescue his group. While driving there Sarah crashes into her zombified mother and kills her before rescuing Trevor and Nina from the radio station. The group heads back to the abandoned warehouse. When Bud does not attack his friends, Sarah believes it is because he was a vegetarian, but Salazar speculates Bud is attracted to Sarah. The group finds an underground bunker, where they reunite with Dr. Logan. They learn about a government project directed by Dr. Engel, which accidentally created the virus that turned the townspeople into zombies. The group explores the bunker, but Dr. Engel attacks and kills Logan. Later, Salazar is swarmed by zombies and - as he perishes - allows Sarah to escape and reunite with Trevor and Nina. While hiding, the trio finds several large gas cylinders. Sarah decides to lure the zombies into the storeroom and burn them with the cylinders. They begin modifying the cylinders into a giant flamethrower. Sarah finds and attracts a mob of zombies. The zombified Dr. Engel drops down from the ceiling behind Sarah and grabs her, but before she is bitten, Bud shoots at Engel. This leads Engel and the other zombies to attack Bud, dismembering him. Sarah leads the zombies to the room where Trevor and Nina are hiding, and they torch the zombies. The three escape the bunker and drive off as a zombie suddenly jumps in front of the camera.  Cast  Sarah is referred to as Cross during the film, but she and her brother are listed as Bowman in the credits.  Production  Reddick, who adapted the script from Romero's original concept, has stated that this film does not have any connection to Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead (although Ving Rhames had also appeared in that film, but as a different character). He told ComingSoon.net: \\"It's going to be a separate movie...We wanted to pay homage to the original with the military and the scientists and the socially relevant stuff that George Romero always does, but we wanted to put a fresh spin on it.\\" Variety announced the project in July 2006, and shooting ended on September 7, 2006, after six weeks in Sofia, Bulgaria. Re-shoots took place in June 2007.  Release  First Look Pictures released it on DVD in the United States on April 8, 2008.  Reception  The film was poorly received by both fans and critics. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 13% of 8 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 2.66/10. Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and called it \\"dead on arrival\\". Barton called Cannon's performance offensively stereotypical. Buz Wallick, also writing for Dread Central, rated it 1.5/5 stars and called it \\"an awful film with awful special features that will hopefully fade from memory in time\\". Heather Seebach of Shock Till You Drop called it \\"cheap horror for indiscriminate genre fans\\" that \\"tiptoes on so-bad-it-is-funny territory\\". Brian Orndorf of DVD Talk rated it 0/5 stars and called it \\"a vile, pathetic, slapdash motion picture\\".

Transcript of interest has uracil at +1 (unknown before assay). 2) Synthesize an 5‚Äô end-labeled primer (using [Œ≥32P] ATP. 3) Make cDNA by extending primer with reverse transcriptase to 5‚Äô-end of transcript. 4) Result is a radioactively labeled extended primer cDNA that is denatured and separated on a polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Typically, a sequencing ladder using the same primer is also on the gel, allowing for rapid identification of the +1 nucleotide (shown in purple.) Primer extension is a technique whereby the 5' ends of RNA can be mapped - that is, they can be sequenced and properly identified. Primer extension can be used to determine the start site of transcription (the end site cannot be determined by this method) by which its sequence is known. This technique requires a radiolabelled primer (usually 20 - 50 nucleotides in length) which is complementary to a region near the 3' end of the mRNA. The primer is allowed to anneal to the RNA and reverse transcriptase is used to synthesize cDNA from the RNA until it reaches the 5' end of the RNA. By denaturing the hybrid and using the extended primer cDNA as a marker on an electrophoretic gel, it is possible to determine the transcriptional start site. It is usually done so by comparing its location on the gel with the DNA sequence (e.g. Sanger sequencing), preferably by using the same primer on the DNA template strand. The exact nucleotide by which the transcription starts at can be pinpointed by matching the labelled extended primer with the marker nucleotide, who are both sharing the same migration distance on the gel. Primer extension offers an alternative to a nuclease protection assay (S1 nuclease mapping) for quantifying and mapping RNA transcripts. The hybridization probe for primer extension is a synthesized oligonucleotide, whereas S1 mapping requires isolation of a DNA fragment. Both methods provide information where a mRNA starts and provide an estimate of the concentration of a transcript by the intensity of the transcript band on the resulting autoradiograph. Unlike S1 mapping, however, primer extension can only be used to locate the 5‚Äô-end of an mRNA transcript because the DNA synthesis required for the assay relies on reverse transcriptase (only polymerizes in the 5‚Äô ‚Üí 3‚Äô direction). Primer extension is unaffected by splice sites and is thus preferable in situations where intervening splice sites prevent S1 mapping. Finally, primer extension is more accurate than S1 mapping because the S1 nuclease used in S1 mapping can ‚Äúnibble off‚Äù ends of the RNA-DNA hybrid or fail to degrade the single-stranded regions completely, making a transcript either appear shorter or longer.

He won the Wimbledon men's singles title two years in a row, in 1893 and 1894. He won the Wimbledon men's doubles in 1890 and 1893. Family life Joshua Pim, known as Josh, was born on 20 May 1869 at 1&2, Millward Terrace, Meath Road, Bray, County Wicklow. His parents were Joshua, a barrister who served in the Royal Tyrone Fusiliers, and Susannah Maria, n√©e Middleton.Dublin Evening Press, 18 July 1857. Derry Standard, 26 May 1869. His father died when Josh was barely two years old, leaving a widow and five young children. As a child Pim lived for a while in Crosthwaite Park, Kingstown. In adulthood he moved with his wife Robin to Killiney. They had one son and three daughters. He died at Secrora, his home in Killiney, on 15 April 1942 aged 72, and was survived by his wife and four children. He was a keen swimmer and golfer, and a member of Killiney Golf Club. Medical career Pim studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Royal College of Physicians in London. He was Medical Officer at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown for 42 years. Tennis Pim was a member of Lansdowne club, then known as the All Ireland Lawn Tennis Club, where he was coached by Thomas Burke His first tennis triumph was in 1890, when he won both the English and Irish doubles championships alongside the Dubliner, Frank Stoker, a cousin of the writer Bram Stoker. He reached the semifinals of the English singles championship, but lost to Willoughby Hamilton from Kildare. The following year he reached the Wimbledon men's singles final, and in 1892 (when he was suffering from typhoid) he reached the \\"challenge round\\", but he lost on both occasions to an English player, Wilfred Baddeley. In 1893, Pim returned to Wimbledon and won both the singles and (with Stoker) the doubles championships. In 1894 he won the singles again. In 1895 he competed in America rather than in England. In 1896, Harold Mahony won at Wimbledon, while Pim concentrated on his medical career, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons that year. Pim played for Ireland against England in 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1896. In 1902, he was summoned from retirement to be the token Irishman in the British Davis Cup squad to face America. Pim was derided for having put on excessive amounts of weight, despite the fact that he shed thirty pounds in six weeks. He lost both his matches and laid down his racket thereafter.

Career Labadie worked in the car industry in Detroit, Michigan. Labadie became an anarchist author, at first mainly republishing articles of previous anarchist authors, and in the late 1930s he would start to publish his own work. In Anarchism Applied to Economics Labadie writes: \\"In a world where inequality of ability is inevitable, anarchists do not sanction any attempt to produce equality by artificial or authoritarian means. The only equality they posit and will strive their utmost to defend is the equality of opportunity. This necessitates the maximum amount of freedom for each individual. This will not necessarily result in equality of incomes or of wealth but will result in returns proportionate to services rendered. Free competition will see to that.\\" (Labadie's emphasis) Labadie was a supporter of jury nullification in an anarchist society. He criticised Murray Rothbard's proposed judicial system which would not allow jury nullification, saying it would uphold, \\"the very economic evils which are at bottom the very reason for human contention and conflict.\\" quoted by Mildred J. Loomis and Mark A. Sullivan, \\"Laurance Labadie: Keeper Of The Flame\\", pp. 116-30, Benjamin R. Tucker and the Champions of Liberty, Coughlin, Hamilton and Sullivan (eds.), p. 124 Labadie was involved with multiple anarchist journals. Besides his \\"Discussion\\", he was also a contributor to \\"A Way Out\\", \\"The Interpreter\\" and \\"Journal of Human Relations\\". There he would often engage in debates with or critique contemporary anarchists and libertarians, such as Murray Rothbard, S.E. Parker and Ayn Rand. Personal life Labadie was born on June 4, 1898. He was youngest child of Sophie and Jo Labadie. He was influenced by his father, and by age of 16 he would get involved in labor movement. He worked as a machinist in Detroit and was self taught. During the Great Depression, he would start his anarchist career with his periodical \\"Discussion - A Journal of Free Spirits\\". In World War II, Laurence would retire from his work and mainly focus on anarchism. He would meet Ralph Borsodi and his School of Living in late 40s and would stay friends with him until his death. After the death of Borsodi's wife, he would move to (and purchase) Borsodi's Doghouse Homestead in Suffern, New York. He would spend the rest of his life as a recluse, contributing to various libertarian journals. He died on August 12, 1975. Laurence Labadie was also a friend of monetary theorist Edwin Clarence Riegel and anarchist revisionist historian James J. Martin.

The airline operated out of the old commuter terminal in Concourse A at Stapleton.OAG Travel Planner & Hotel/Motel Guide, 1972, Reuben H. Donnelley Corp.

Rocky Mountain Airways de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operating a scheduled commuter flight at Denver's Stapleton International Airport in 1971 Vail Airways began operations with Cessna 310 piston twin aircraft, followed by the Rockwell Aero Commander piston twin. In 1969, Rocky Mountain Airways expanded with the 19 passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter twin engine turboprop.PodOmatic, Gordon Autry interview podcast. Retrieved: January 23, 2013. (subscription required) On February 3, 1978, Rocky Mountain Airways took delivery as the worldwide launch customer of the larger, 50 passenger de Havilland Canada Dash 7-102 four engine turboprop. In 1983, Rocky Mountain had placed an order for six 37-passenger de Havilland Canada Dash 8 twin turboprops, coincident with the type's rollout, but in the event, no Dash 8 aircraft were delivered to Rocky Mountain. Both the DHC-6 Twin Otter and the DHC-7 Dash 7 featured short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance. This enabled Rocky Mountain Airways to serve destinations that otherwise would not have received scheduled passenger air service. One example was the Avon STOLport (WHR) located in close proximity to the Vail ski resort which was served with the Dash 7. Another example was the Steamboat Springs Airport (KSBS or SBS) which was also served with the Dash 7. With a relatively short runway length of 4,452 feet and an airfield elevation of 6,882 feet, the Dash 7 was well suited for passenger operations from this small airport located near the Steamboat Springs ski resort. Rocky Mountain Airways also operated Twin Otter flights from Lake County Airport (LXV) in Leadville, Colorado. With an airfield elevation of 9,927 feet, Leadville is the highest airport ever to have received scheduled passenger air service in the U.S. The Avon STOLport, which was a private airstrip controlled by the airline at Vail, no longer exists. Airline service to Vail is now provided via the Eagle County Airport, 35 miles to the west via Interstate 70. Steamboat Springs is now served by the Yampa Valley Airport, 25 miles to the west via U.S. 40. Leadville no longer has airline service. Another primary route served by the airline was between Aspen-Pitkin County Airport and Denver. RMA flew the Twin Otter between the two destinations and then introduced Dash 7 service. The major competitor at the time in Aspen was Aspen Airways which flew Convair 440 piston engine prop aircraft which were subsequently replaced with Convair 580 turboprops. Aspen Airways then began operating British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jet aircraft on the route. Rocky Mountain and Aspen Airways competed for many years from Aspen. Currently, Aspen-Denver service is flown by SkyWest Airlines operating as United Express with Canadair CRJ-700 regional jets. Upon its sale to Texas Air Corporation in 1986, Rocky Mountain Airways began serving as a Continental Express air carrier in order to provide passenger feed at this major airline's hub operation in Denver at the time. The Twin Otter and Dash 7 aircraft were painted in Continental Airlines distinctive white livery with orange, red, and gold striping and \\"Continental Express\\" titles. The Continental Express service at Denver was shared at first with Trans-Colorado Airlines and was greatly expanded in 1987 when Trans-Colorado ceased operating at Denver. The Twin Otters were later retired and new ATR-42 and Beechcraft 1900C turboprop commuter airliners were acquired which became the standard aircraft for all Continental Express regional air carriers at the time. The Dash 7s were retained for their STOL ability to serve the Aspen airport and were also used to operate service into the Telluride Airport with its airfield elevation of 9,070 feet.Feb. 1, 1987 Continental Airlines system timetable All Rocky Mountain aircraft received the new blue and gold livery introduced by Continental in 1990.

Its use is important in diagnosing and monitoring various eye conditions associated with glaucoma. The goniolens or gonioscope The goniolens allows the clinician - usually an ophthalmologist or optometrist - to view the irideocorneal angle through a mirror or prism, without which the angle is masked by total internal reflection from the ocular tissue. The mechanism for this process varies with each type of goniolens. Three examples of goniolenses are the: * Koeppe direct goniolens: this transparent device is placed directly on the cornea along with lubricating fluid, to avoid damaging its surface. The steeper curvature of this goniolens' exterior surface optically eliminates the total internal reflection problem and allows a view of the iridocorneal angle. Unfortunately it requires the patient to be lying down, and so it cannot be so easily used with an ordinary slit lamp in an optometric environment. In an ophthalmological setting, an operating microscope is one available option. * Goldmann indirect goniolens: this truncated-cone like device utilises mirrors to reflect the light from the iridocorneal angle into the direction of the observer (as shown by the schematic diagram). In practice the image comes out roughly orthogonal to the back surface (nearer the practitioner), making observation and magnification with a slit lamp easy and reliable. The small, curved front surface does not rest on the cornea, but instead vaults over it, with lubricating fluid filling the gap. The border of the front surface rests on the sclera. While the view obtained is smaller than that of the Koeppe goniolens, it can be used with the patient sitting upright, and other mirrors within the device can be used to obtain views of other parts of the eye, such as the retina and the ora serrata. * Zeiss indirect goniolens: this instrument uses a similar method to the Goldmann, but employs prisms in the place of mirrors. Its four symmetrical prisms allow visualisation of the iridocorneal angle in four quadrants of the eye simultaneously, and works well with a slit lamp. Most importantly, the size and shape of the instrument - a smaller front surface that rests on the cornea without requiring lubricating fluid, only the patient's tear film - allows for indentation gonioscopy, which can be used for further diagnosis. There are many other goniolenses available for use, including modified versions of the aforementioned, which prove valuable for surgical use (goniotomy). The gonioscopy process Although the details vary based on the type of goniolens used, in general the gonioscopy process involves: * briefly explaining the procedure to the patient * cleaning and sterilising the front (curved) surface of the goniolens * applying lubricating fluid to the front surface if appropriate * anaesthetising the patient's cornea with topical anaesthetic * preparing the slit lamp for viewing through the goniolens * gently moving the patient's eyelids away from the cornea * slowly applying the goniolens to the ocular surface, forming suction * fine- tuning the slit lamp to optimise the view * interpreting the gonioscopic image * swivelling the goniolens to view each section of the iridocorneal angle * when satisfied, very carefully breaking suction via the eyelids * cleaning the instruments and irrigating the patient's eyes with [saline] if desired Interpreting the gonioscopic image The typical view through most goniolenses is illustrated by these idealistic schematic diagrams. In reality the clinical picture can vary both within and between individual patients. This view of the iridocorneal angle provides information in several ways: Sample View of Wide Angle Sample View of Narrow Angle Sample View of Anterior Synechiae Sample View of Anterior Synechiae with Indentation Gonioscopy * Iridocorneal angle width: The width of the iridocorneal angle is one factor affecting the drainage of aqueous humour from the eye's anterior chamber. A wide angle allows sufficient drainage of humour through the trabecular meshwork (unless obstructed), whereas a narrow angle may impede the drainage system and leave the patient susceptible to acute angle-closure glaucoma. Gonioscopy indicates the angular width of the iridocorneal angle by the number of ocular structures visible above the rim of the iris. Generally the more structures visible, the wider the angle. However, not all structures may be easily discriminated, especially the faint Schwalbe's line at the top of the stack. Further information is obtained if a very narrow slit lamp beam may be shone upon the angle, as the angle width is generally proportional to the separation of the corneal beam and iris beam when they meet in the angle. * Anterior synechiae: Anterior synechiae are simply strands of the iris attaching to the iridocorneal angle or surrounding tissue. This may be exacerbated by ocular inflammation, which can render the angle 'sticky' with inflammatory cells and substances, or by structural defects in the iris which lead to strands floating free into the anterior chamber, as may occur with iris atrophy and congenital iris defects. Gonioscopy allows a direct view of these synechiae, and is thus especially helpful for the more subtle cases. * Indentation gonioscopy: An extension of the above two concepts, indentation gonioscopy involves the applied pressure of the goniolens against the eye, acutely raising the intraocular pressure in the anterior chamber and subsequently opening up the iridocorneal angle mechanically, allowing a greater understanding of the nature of the anterior synechiae. In the absence of synechiae, indentation gonioscopy may reveal the area where the cornea and iris are truly anatomically attached, as compared to where they are simply apposed against each other. * Sampaolesi line: Hyperpigmentation at, or anterior to, Schwalbe's line, which can signify pigment dispersion syndrome or pseudoexfoliation syndrome.

It ended operations on December 5, 1989 and its assets subsequently liquidated. Shortly before that time, employees received a pay cut for two pay periods in an attempt to improve cash flow at the airline. At one point just before its demise, Presidential operated an odd mix of fleet types: twelve British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and Jetstream 32 commuter turboprops (some of which were contracted), two early model Beechcraft 1900 commuter turboprops, eight BAe 146 jets and one aging Boeing 737. The BAe Jetstream turboprops were operated as United Express flights as were the Dash 8 propjets. The 737 primarily flew roundtrip service between Washington Dulles (IAD) and MacArthur-Islip (ISP) on Long Island, New York. In 1988, the 737 was used as the campaign plane for first Republican Senator Robert Dole and then Massachusetts Governor and Democratic nominee for president, Michael Dukakis. Reporters assigned to Dukakis nicknamed the plane \\"The Sky Pig\\" because it was so slow. Of these aircraft, the Beechcraft 1900s were the first to go as they were sold to pay bills. There was also an odd mix of paint schemes. Some Jetstream turboprops were painted in the red, white and blue Presidential scheme while others featured the United Express livery featuring a white fuselage with colored stripes. The BAe Jetstream aircraft contracted from Metro Airlines were branded in an Eastern Airlines mainline paint scheme (and flown by pilots of Metro Airlines which were assigned to the Eastern Metro Express division). At least one BAe 146 jet was painted in Continental Express colors as well.

Biological activity Resiniferatoxin has a score of 16 billion Scoville heat units, making pure resiniferatoxin about 500 to 1000 times hotter than pure capsaicin.National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center Department of Perioperative Medicine Chemical from cactus-like plant shows promise in controlling surgical pain, while leaving touch and coordination intact, rat study shows News release December 21, 2017, retrieved 28 February 2018. Resiniferatoxin activates transient vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) in a subpopulation of primary afferent sensory neurons involved in nociception, the transmission of physiological pain. TRPV1 is an ion channel in the plasma membrane of sensory neurons and stimulation by resiniferatoxin causes this ion channel to become permeable to cations, especially calcium. The influx of cations causes the neuron to depolarize, transmitting signals similar to those that would be transmitted if the innervated tissue were being burned or damaged. This stimulation is followed by desensitization and analgesia, in part because the nerve endings die from calcium overload.  Total synthesis  Figure 1. A partial synthesis of a resiniferatoxin derivative based on the method put forth by the Wender group of Stanford University. This partial synthesis shows how to create the three-ring backbone of RTX A total synthesis of (+)-resiniferatoxin was completed by the Wender group at Stanford University in 1997. The process begins with a starting material of 1,4-pentadien-3-ol and consists of more than 25 significant steps. , this represented the only complete total synthesis of any member of the daphnane family of molecules. One of the main challenges in synthesizing a molecule such as resiniferatoxin is forming the three-ring backbone of the structure. The Wender group was able to form the first ring of the structure by first synthesizing Structure 1 in Figure 1. By reducing the ketone of Structure 1 followed by oxidizing the furan nucleus with m-CPBA and converting the resulting hydroxy group to an oxyacetate, Structure 2 can be obtained. Structure 2 contains the first ring of the three- ring structure of RTX. It reacts through an oxidopyrylium cycloaddition when heated with DBU in acetonitrile to form Structure 4 by way of Intermediate 3. Several steps of synthesis are required to form Structure 5 from Structure 4, with the main goal of positioning the allylic branch of the seven-membered ring in a trans conformation. Once this conformation is achieved, zirconocene- mediated cyclization of Structure 5 can occur, and oxidizing the resulting hydroxy group with TPAP will yield Structure 6. Structure 6 contains all three rings of the RTX backbone and can then be converted to resiniferatoxin through additional synthesis steps attaching the required functional groups. An alternative approach to synthesizing the three-ring backbone makes use of radical reactions to create the first and third rings in a single step, followed by the creation of the remaining ring. It has been proposed by the Inoue group of the University of Tokyo.  Toxicity  Resiniferatoxin is rather toxic and can inflict chemical burns in tiny quantities. The primary action of resiniferatoxin is to activate sensory neurons responsible for the perception of pain. It is currently the most potent TRPV1 agonist known, with ~500x higher binding affinity for TRPV1 than capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot chili peppers such as those produced by Capsicum annuum. Animal experiments on the rat suggest that, in humans, ingestion of 1.672 g may be fatal or cause serious damage to health. It causes severe burning pain in sub- microgram (less than 1/1,000,000th of a gram) quantities when ingested orally.  Research  Sorrento Therapeutics has been developing RTX as a means to provide pain relief for forms of advanced cancer. The nerve desensitizing properties of RTX were once thought to be useful to treat overactive bladder (OAB) by preventing the bladder from transmitting ‚Äúsensations of urgency‚Äù to the brain, similar to how they can prevent nerves from transmitting signals of pain; RTX has never received FDA approval for this use. RTX has also previously been investigated as a treatment for interstitial cystitis, rhinitis, and lifelong premature ejaculation (PE).

In the late 19th century it reportedly had an area of .Europe by √âlise√© Reclus, p. 152 History The Scutari Vilayet was established in 1867. The Sanjak of Scutari was established when Ottoman Empire acquired Shkodra after the Siege of Shkodra in 1478‚Äì9. A big part of Principality of Zeta was added to territory of Sanjak of Scutari in 1499. In 1514 this territory was separated from the Sanjak of Scutari and established as separate Sanjak of Montenegro, under the rule of Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá. When he died in 1528, the Sanjak of Montenegro was merged with Sanjak of Scutari, as unique administrative unit with certain degree of autonomy. In 1867, the Sanjak of Scutari merged with the Sanjak of Skopje and became the Scutari Vilayet. Its sanjaks were Sanjak of Scutari, Prizren, and Sanjak of Dibra. In 1877, Prizren passed to the Kosovo Vilayet and Debar passed to the Monastir Vilayet, while Durr√´s (Dƒ±ra√ß) township became Durr√´s Sanjak. After the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) Bar, Podgorica, ƒ∞≈üpozi and Zabyak townships were ceded to Montenegro in 1878. Also √úlg√ºn one was ceded to Montenegro in 1881. In the late Ottoman period, unlike in other areas of the empire, Albanian Catholics in ƒ∞≈ükodra vilayet had access to emerging Albanian language schooling subsidized by Austria-Hungary. Local Catholic clergy were also involved in developing mostly religious Albanian literature, aimed at preserving and strengthening the Roman Catholic faith in the region. Due partly to the location of being near the border with Montenegro the state exempted the townspeople of ƒ∞≈ükodra from regular military service and unlike other urban dwellers within the empire they paid fewer taxes. Ottoman control mainly existed in the few urban centres and valleys of the vilayet and was minimal and almost non-existent in the mountains, where Malisors (Albanian highlanders) lived an autonomous existence according to kanun (tribal law) of Lek Dukagjini. Disputes would be solved through tribal law within the framework of vendetta or gjakmarrja (blood feuding) and the activity was widespread among the Malisors, while Ottoman officials strongly disproved of the practice. Nineteen percent of male deaths in ƒ∞≈ükodra vilayet were caused by murders due to vendetta and blood feuding during the late Ottoman period. Malisors viewed Ottoman officials as a threat to their tribal way of living and left it to their bajraktars (chieftains) to deal with the Ottoman political system. The Malisors (highlanders) lived in three geographical regions within ƒ∞≈ükodra sanjak. Malesia e Madhe (great highlands) with its religiously mixed Catholic-Muslim five large (Hoti, Kelmendi, Shkreli, Kastrati and Gruda) and seven small tribes; Malesia e Vogel (small highlands) with seven Catholic tribes such as the Shala, Shoshi, Toplana, Nikaj; and Mirdita, which was also a large powerful tribe that could mobilise 5,000 irregular troops. The government estimated the military strength of Malisors in ƒ∞≈ükodra sanjak as numbering over 30,000 tribesmen and Ottoman officials were of the view that the highlanders could defeat Montenegro on their own with limited state assistance. Dƒ±ra√ß sanjak contained the fertile plain of Zadrima between Mirdita and the Drin river. Political life in the sanjak was dominated by a few powerful Albanian landowners such as the Toptani family who controlled the area around Kruja and Tirana as a personal fiefdom with family holdings amounting to some 123,000 acres. To protect economic interests landowning beys in the area maintained small private armies numbering between 200-500 men that also served as bodyguards during travel. In the 1880s from an Albanian point of view the sanjaks of ƒ∞≈ükodra and Dƒ±ra√ß along with the whole of ƒ∞≈ükodra vilayet belonged to the region of Geg√´nia. In 1912 and beginning of 1913 it was occupied by members of Balkan League during the First Balkan War. In 1914 the territory of Scutari Vilayet became a part of Principality of Albania, established on the basis of peace contract signed during London Conference in 1913. Administrative divisions Sanjaks of the Vilayet: # Sanjak of Scutari (Shkod√´r, Lezh√´, Orosh, Puk√´) # Sanjak of Dira√ß (Durr√´s, Tirana, Kruj√´, Kavaj√´)  Demographics  During the 1880s, the population of ƒ∞≈ükodra vilayet ranged between 200,000-300,000 people, split between the two sanjaks of ƒ∞≈ükodra (Catholic majority) and Dƒ±ra√ß (Muslim majority). Albanians were the main ethnicity in the vilayet consisting more than 90 percent of the population. Ottoman-Albanian intellectual Sami Frash√´ri during the 1880s estimated the population of Shkod√´r as numbering 37,000 inhabitants that consisted of three-quarters being Muslims and the rest Christians made up of mostly Catholics and a few hundred Orthodox. 1874 estimation According to Russian consulate Ivan Yastrebov's estimations, there were 80.000 Catholic males, 20.000 Orthodox males, and 9.500 Muslim males in the Sanjak of Scutari. The majority of the population spoke the Albanian language.

Early life Lawrence Adamson was born at Douglas, Isle of Man, the second son of Lawrence William Adamson.Coat of Arms: Vert goutte d'eau a Cross invected in the first quarter a Key in pale in the second a Lion passant Or LL.D., Grand Seneschal of the IoM and his wife Annie Jane n√©e Flint. In 1866 the family went to Newcastle- on-Tyne, where his father served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1900. At fourteen years of age Lawrence went to Rugby School, where he educated in the Classics, and represented his school at football. At the University of Oxford he read Classics and Jurisprudence, taking the degree of MA, before being called to the Bar in 1885. Adamson, suffering from a bad attack of pleurisy, was advised to live in a warmer climate. On 20 December 1885 he emigrated to Australia, to practise at the Sydney Bar, but the humidity in summertime did not suit his condition, so he moved to Melbourne. Teaching career Adamson applied for admission to the Melbourne Bar, and while waiting occupied himself with private coaching; in January 1887 was appointed senior resident master at Wesley College, Melbourne under Arthur Way. He also became sports master and chairman of the games committee, and, with James Cuthbertson of Geelong Grammar School, helped to frame a code of rules for inter-school athletics. In 1892 he became second master and was also resident tutor and lecturer at Trinity College. In 1893 he became resident tutor at Trinity College (University of Melbourne) and until 1896 lectured there in the evenings while teaching at Wesley by day. In 1898 he joined Otto Krome as joint-headmaster of the University High School. Four years later he was appointed headmaster of Wesley College after he indicated he would be responsible financially for the school's growth. Inheritances had made Adamson a wealthy man. Headmaster of Wesley College Melbourne had been slowly recovering from the effects of a land boom and all the public schools had suffered and Wesley's troubles had been greater than all others. When Adamson took charge only one hundred boys of the previous year had returned to school. By the end of the year, 243 were on the roll and the attendance gradually rose until it reached 600 in 1930. Adamson wanted no more because he did not believe in large public schools, and always held that it was impossible for the head to know the boys in a school whose numbers were much over 500. While promoting scholarship, Adamson encouraged athletics at Wesley and quickly set up an ideal of sportsmanship of which the keynote was that boys should learn to 'win decently and lose decently'. He advocated good manners with pithy illustrations on the effect of them, he instilled a sense of honour, he believed in hero-worship, but all the while he was mindful of practical things. His school was the first to have medical examinations for all boys, and the knowledge of a boy's physical condition was applied to his work in class. Justice was the basis of all his work, and he became not only efficient as a headmaster but thoroughly popular with the boys. There was no want of respect in his nickname \\"Dicky\\" and there was a really genuine affection. Influence and committees Adamson left a stamp of influence outside his school. He was active during the early years of the Victorian Amateur Athletic Association (president 1901‚Äì1905). For 37 years he was president of the Victorian Amateur Football Association, and he did good work for the Victorian Cricket Association during difficult times as a delegate, honorary treasurer and president. In education he was not merely the headmaster of a public school. As early as 1892 he was one of the founders of the Victorian Institute of Schoolmasters, and his continual interest in the whole question of education enabled him to do valuable work, before and after the passing of the Registration of Schools Act in 1905, as a member of the registration board, the council of public education, the Faculty of Arts at the University of Melbourne, and the University Council. This by no means exhausts the list of committees on which he served but none of these interfered with his work as headmaster, which went steadily on until a long illness led to his retirement in October 1932. He died a few weeks later on 14 December 1932. Adamson became headmaster of Wesley at age 42, a quiet, somewhat portly man of medium height. He made no special claim to scholarship, he was far too busy to be able to give much time to studies, but he liked to take a class and he got to know the many generations of boys who passed through his hands. He was fond of poetry, he wrote the words and music of some of the school songs, and he collected and appreciated old silver, china and furniture. He was the first to import an aeroplane into Australia, a Wilbur Wright biplane in 1909, although he did not fly it himself. Adamson could still delight in stories like Treasure Island and A Gentleman of France, and he could read Rudyard Kipling's Stalky & Co. with an appreciation granted to few schoolmasters. He was a lay canon of St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, and a practical Christian of the kind that boys could understand. To read so moving an address as that given to the boys after the close of the War enables one to realise his power over them. He never married. His portrait by William Beckwith McInnes is at Wesley College. External links * Wesley College home * L. A.

Early life McNicoll was born in the Melbourne suburb of Emerald Hill, on 27 May 1877. He was the only son and eldest of three children to William Walter Alexander McNicoll (1852‚Äì1937) and Ellen McNicoll (n√©e Ramsay, 1852‚Äì1900). He trained as a teacher in the Victorian Education Department and at Melbourne University. He held posts in various country schools in Victoria, then as senior master at Melbourne High School and, from 1911 to 1914, founding principal of Geelong High School. At the same time he had been active in the Victorian militia, which at the outbreak of the First World War became part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). First World War As a lieutenant colonel, McNicoll commanded the 6th Battalion, 2nd Australian Brigade, at Gallipoli and was seriously wounded during an infantry charge in the Second Battle of Krithia on 8 May 1915. The brigade suffered 36 percent casualties in the course of two hours of action. He was found on the battlefield that evening by Charles Bean, then a war correspondent‚Äîlater, Australia's official war historian. Bean piled discarded packs around McNicoll as protection against the still-continuing small arms fire and returned in the night with a stretcher party. McNicoll was invalided to Alexandria and then to London, where a second operation finally located and removed the bullet from his abdomen. Following a year's recuperation in Melbourne, McNicoll was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 10th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Division‚Äîunder the command of Major General John Monash and, later, John Gellibrand. From December 1916 to the armistice nearly two years later, the brigade was part of numerous actions on the Western Front, including Messines, Ypres, the Somme, and Amiens. Later life After the war McNicoll returned to teaching as founding principal of what is now the Argyl School in Goulburn, in southern New South Wales. In 1931 he stood for and won the seat of Werriwa (extending from Goulburn to the coast) in the federal parliament, running as a member of the Country Party. He resigned towards the end of his first term, however, when he was appointed Administrator of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. He served in that position from 1934 up to the time of the Japanese invasion in 1942. (In this period, the northern part of what is now Papua New Guinea, including New Britain and Bougainville, was administered by Australia under a League of Nations mandate; the southern part, Papua, was an Australian colony.) The manifold responsibilities of Administrator ranged from education and justice to defence, with often conflicting advice or direction coming from the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Australian government and pressures as well from the various religious missions and commercial mining and plantation interests‚Äîthe latter nearly the sole source of the Territory's revenues. Keenly interested in exploration, he led an expedition to the upper Sepik in 1935 (the party included the young J.K. McCarthy) and subsequently sponsored the Hagen-Sepik Patrol (1938‚Äì39) which explored the last great unknown tract of the Territory. He was knighted for his work organising relief efforts after the 1937 volcanic eruption that nearly destroyed the territory's capital, Rabaul. He married Hildur Marschalk Wedel Jarlsberg, from a distinguished Norwegian family, on 10 June 1905. Their marriage produced five children, all sons: Ronald Ramsay McNicoll (1906‚Äì1996); Sir Alan Wedel Ramsay McNicoll (1908‚Äì1987); Colin Wedel Ramsay McNicoll (1909‚Äì1921); Frederick Oscar Ramsay McNicoll (1910‚Äì1989); and David Ramsay (aka Jack Meander) McNicoll (1914‚Äì2000). Ronald and Alan both attained senior positions in the Australian military‚Äîbecoming a major general and vice admiral respectively‚Äîwhile David was a well known Sydney-based journalist.

The poem discussed the history of colonialism, neocolonialism, imperialism, the War on Terror, environmental racism, and structural violence as well as the attacks. The poem begins: > Before I start this poem, I'd like to ask you to join me In a moment of > silence In honour of those who died in the World Trade Center and the > Pentagon last September 11th. The poem goes on to critique that notion of a moment of silence. The majority of the poem serves as a list of historical crimes by governments and the West against indigenous peoples or the Third World and how the structures which perpetuate those crimes slip through the cracks, on a scale far beyond the September 11th tragedy. The poem was controversial at the time of its publication because it contested the established weighting of human experiences.

History The airline was founded in 2001 with a mix of tax credits and government loans totaling $27 million and expanded rapidly, filing with the Air Transportation Stabilization Board for a guarantee of $17 million from a $25 million loan, though this was rejected, as the Board deemed the airline's business plan to be too risky. The airline filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in 2004 after attempts to secure additional financing and investments were unsuccessful. After it ceased operations, all five of the company's aircraft were repossessed by creditors and all other property belonging to the airline was auctioned off. The airline's foundation was based upon giving Oklahoma City and Tulsa travelers quality and affordable non-stop service to a number of destinations, ultimately with flights to underserved heavily traveled business destinations on the east and west coasts. To assist in starting the airline, the operating certificate was purchased from Ozark Airlines, an airline not related to the original Ozark Airlines, but a small airline operating Dornier 328JETs. The airline also took over operation of Ozark's two aircraft, and later expanded the fleet to five aircraft including a Dornier 328 turbo-prop by the time of the airline's closure. In 2002 Great Plains joined with commuter airline Rio Grande Air to provide a feeder network from Albuquerque to the smaller New Mexico cities of Alamogordo and Taos as well as to Durango, Colorado.

The play is set during the period of the Third Crusade. Originally conceived by Tim Rice during his collaboration with Andrew Lloyd Webber, the project was originally titled \\"Come Back, Richard, Your Country Needs You\\" and a single of the same title was recorded in 1969. The project was shelved until Rice met Stephen Oliver in the 1970s, and the pair began working on a musical centering on King Richard I of England; as it developed, the project shifted its focus to a minstrel in the King's court, vying for pop-stardom, and his 'progressive' girlfriend. Though the musical is largely a comic romp, it does tackle some serious issues. Historically, Blondel lays out the basic goings-on of the Third Crusade as told through the eyes of the English political environment. Although the musical frequently mentions the Crusade, it is never actually shown, excepting Richard's imprisonment in Austria upon his return trip. The play also deals with one of the many assassination attempts made on Richard, and an attempt by Prince John to steal the throne of England from his brother. As the Monks say at the end of Act One, 'Who said this piece wasn't educational?' Blondel opened in London on 2 November 1983 and played in two different theatres in the West End, eventually closing after less than two years. After more than twenty years away from a professional London stage, it returned at the Pleasance Theatre in Islington. The new production starred Abi Finley, semi finalist of the hit BBC1 show How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?, and Chris Grierson, a regular from the teen soap, Hollyoaks. Produced by Pete Shaw, and directed by Patrick Wilde, the revived version of Blondel appeared for a limited season of six weeks. Rice continued to develop the script and has recently created a new version of the show. This re-worked version (now titled Lute!) was scheduled to have its world premiere at the University of Texas at El Paso Dinner Theater and run from 27 January 2012 until 12 February 2012.El Paso Times, \\"Tim Rice, of 'The Lion King' fame, will be in El Paso next week\\" Although many productions have been staged worldwide, Blondel has never appeared on Broadway. Synopsis ;Act I The opening words of the musical (above) as sung by a group of Monks explain the situation (\\"Monks' Introduction\\"). Blondel is an unappreciated musician trying to make his big break by writing a song for the King, Richard the Lionheart. Fiona, his girlfriend, feels that it's a waste of time to write for the King as the monarchy can't possibly be around for much longer. Even though she does enjoy the tune, she suggests he get a real job to help support her. Blondel explains that he can't. He says that he \\"nearly hit big with 'Send in the Jesters'\\" and feels a breakthrough coming and to give up now would be impossible. Fiona leaves Blondel and decides to take her well-being into her own hands. (\\"Blondel and Fiona/I'm a Monarchist\\") The Monks open the Ministry of Feudal Affairs (\\"incorporating the Departments of Unemployment, the Environment, Social Security, and Gratuitous Executions\\"), which is \\"presided over by HRH Prince John\\" at which Fiona promptly shows to ask for her freedom. Unwilling and unable to pay the fee, Fiona is first denied her request by Prince John and later denied it by the King who explains that \\"running this joint's not as cheap as it looks\\". Fiona is swept aside in order for the King to announce that he will be embarking on the Crusade and that John will be in charge while the King is away. Fiona is enraged by this notion as it will expend more money to go on the Crusade than it would to grant her freedom and she leaves the court. (\\"The Ministry of Feudal Affairs\\") Fiona and Blondel soon find themselves together again. He manages to convince her that his song for the King will grant them all their wishes and she agrees to help him. (\\"The Least of My Troubles\\") \\"Thus reunited, what a touching scene\\" the Monks proclaim as Fiona and Blondel set off to meet the King at Dover before he embarks on his journey. Once there Blondel is unable to present his song to Richard as the King is anxious to leave and doesn't have time for such things. Richard suggests Blondel should take it up with John instead and the Crusaders leave for the Holy Land. (\\"Lionheart\\") Back at the Ministry of Feudal Affairs, Blondel and Fiona present the song to John who promptly throws the song away and proclaims that all songs should from now on be dedicated to him and not Richard. (\\"No Rhyme for Richard\\") John then tasks Blondel to write a song about him but Blondel refuses, saying it's an important job but that his heart's just not in it. Fiona is outraged by Blondel's refusal of work saying that this is the break he's been waiting for. As Blondel lists his reasons for not wanting to write a song dedicated to his Prince, both John and Fiona grow increasingly angered. The scene culminates in John banishing Blondel to the Continent and declaring \\"snub a prince but realize you've sunk a singing career\\". (\\"Trio\\") Promptly realizing he's made a mistake by sending Blondel after Richard, John's mood becomes depressed. A mysterious man appears by John's side and offers to take care of the problem for him, for a price, but misidentifies the target as Blondel and can't identify the real target, the King, at all. Once all is set straight, the Assassin sets off on Richard's trail. (\\"Assassin's Song\\") The act closes with Fiona, realizing that Blondel doesn't love her as much as he loves his music and that she'll never get the kind of social change she wants. Even through her realizations, Fiona decides to chase after Blondel, unsure of what she's actually looking for. (\\"Running Back for More\\") ;Act II Act Two opens on the Continent, Blondel in hot pursuit of King Richard. Blondel journeys through France, Spain, and Italy wowing crowds of natives with his music and searching high and low for his King (\\"Have you seen my King?\\" \\"NO!\\") but to no avail. As the trek continues, Blondel begins to lose hope that he'll ever find Richard. Meanwhile, the Assassin chases after Blondel, his patience with the troubadour's music thinning. At the point of giving up on the chase, Blondel runs into Fiona who tells him that Richard is being held prisoner in Austria by Duke Leopold and the pair take off to find the King together. (\\"Blondel in Europe\\") While sitting in prison, Richard laments about his situation and longs for the days of the Crusade when he was free to do as he pleased. Back in London, John, pleased with his own cleverness and handiwork, prepares himself for becoming King of England. (\\"Saladin Days/I Can't Wait to be King\\") Arriving in Salzburg, the pursuers come to rest in an inn just before completing the last leg of the journey to the King's cell. The Assassin admits that he's becoming extremely discouraged by the whole situation and that the \\"job is killing me\\". Blondel, on the other hand, has a renewed sense of ambition and refuses to give up declaring that the King will soon be found. Fiona suggests that lingering would not behoove anyone at this point and they should press on before time has run out though she is still unsure whether or not she really wants to help. The Assassin decides that he'd \\"rather murder Prince John\\" but will soldier on while John announces that Richard has died on his Crusade and that he will be assuming the throne of England. (\\"The Inn at Salzburg/Blondel's Search\\") Having found the King in his prison, Fiona decides to speak with the Duke of Austria about letting Richard go and the Assassin nears his victim, poised for the murder. The Duke dictates a letter to Prince John, demanding a million-crown ransom. Fiona sweet-talks and flatters the Duke in order to get him to release Richard, which the Duke agrees to. (\\"The Duke of Austria's Quarter\\") Ready to give up the search, Blondel, quite by accident, runs into Richard. With Richard now released, the Duke's English visitors make their way out of the castle but just as they're about to walk out the door, the Duke has a sudden change of heart and decides that he's not going to let them go after all. The Duke will only let Blondel and Richard go if Fiona will stay with him in Austria. Unwilling to stay with Leopold, Fiona tricks him into walking outside toward someone she says is better-suited for him at which point the Assassin, seeing the crown on the Duke's head, attacks, killing him. Richard, Blondel, and Fiona declare it to be \\"a most important day\\" and decide it's time to go back to England. However, before they leave, Fiona demands a pardon and her freedom from the King in exchange for keeping her mouth shut about the monarchy to which the King agrees reluctantly. Meanwhile, the Assassin, having killed the wrong man, laments about his \\"first failure\\" and wonders if he can make a comeback. However he goes on to discover that he didn't even really kill the Duke (\\"Leopold is a-okay\\") and the two men find comfort in the other's mistakes. (\\"The Cell\\") Blondel, Fiona, and Richard make their way back to England where John is proceeding with his plans to become King. Having declared Richard dead, John impatiently awaits his coronation. At the moment before the crown is placed on John's head, Richard bursts through the doors and puts a swift end to the illegal ceremony. (\\"Westminster Abbey\\") Having stopped his brother's coronation, Richard declares Blondel the \\"country's foremost composer\\" and at last allows him to perform his song. With the help of the Blondettes, Blondel becomes the pop sensation he'd been waiting to become. (\\"I'm a Monarchist (Reprise)\\") Having been absolved their indiscretions and declared friends and heroes of the monarchy, Blondel and Fiona renew their relationship and declare their love for each other. (\\"Running Back for More (Reprise)\\") Production history=The London Stage Tim Rice and Patrick Wilde (Matt Harrop in foreground) at rehearsals for London revival of BlondelBlondel opened in Bath on 12 September 1983 and soon moved to Manchester where it stayed for two weeks before moving to the newly refurbished Old Vic on 2 November. Lord Olivier spoke the prologue at a Gala performance on 8 November.Olivier, Terry Coleman, 2005, p585 The show remained at the Old Vic for eleven months before moving to the Aldwych on London's West End. Because of high production costs and decreasing revenues, Blondel closed in the Aldwych after only eight months. Original Cast *Blondel - Paul Nicholas *Fiona - Sharon Lee-Hill *Richard - Stephen Tate *John - David Burt *The Assassin - Chris Langham *Leopold - Kevin Williams *The Monks - Cantabile (group) - Richard Bryan, Nicholas Ibbotson, Stewart Collins & Michael Steffan The London revival of the show opened at the Pleasance Theatre on 23 November 2006. The production saw the show revamped and rearranged by Tim Rice and director Patrick Wilde. Young composer Mathew Pritchard took Stephen Oliver's original score and completely rearranged the work, also adding new material. The story was sharpened, particularly in the second act, to produce a punchier (and funnier) version particularly well suited for an ensemble production. 2006 London Cast *Blondel - Chris Grierson *Fiona - Abi Finley *Richard - Mark Inscoe *John - Matt Harrop *The Assassin - Napoleon Ryan *Leopold - David Paul West *Monks - James Durrant, Gavin James, Charlie Tighe, Nick Trumble *The Blondettes - Zoe Harrison, Polli Redston, Rebecca Seale Blondel in the United States The first production of Blondel in the United States was staged at the University of Texas in El Paso by the Union Dinner Theatre. It opened on 11 April 1985. Blondel was again produced in the United States by Farmingdale High School in Long Island, New York during May 1985. Both productions were attended by Tim Rice. Since the mid-1980s, Blondel has been produced by theaters and amateur groups all around the world but has yet to take its place on the Broadway stage.

Naima Akef was born in Tanta on the Nile Delta. Her parents were acrobats in the Akef Circus (run by Naima‚Äôs grandfather), which was one of the best known circuses at the time. She started performing in the circus at the age of four, and quickly became one of the most popular acts with her acrobatic skills. Her family was based in the Bab el Khalq district of Cairo, but they traveled far and wide in order to perform. Dancing The circus disbanded when Naima was 14, but this was only the beginning of her career. Her grandfather had many connections in the performance world of Cairo and he introduced her to his friends. When Naima‚Äôs parents divorced, she formed an acrobatic and clown act that performed in many clubs throughout Cairo. She then got the chance to work in Badia Masabni's famous nightclub, where she became a star and was one of the very few who danced and sang. Her time with Badeia, however, was short-lived, as Badia favored her, which made the other performers jealous. One day they ganged up on her and attempted to beat her up, but she proved to be stronger and more agile and won the fight. This caused her to be fired, so she started performing elsewhere. A star The Kit Kat club was another famous venue in Cairo, and this is where Naima was introduced to film director Abbas Kemal. His brother Hussein Fawzy, also a film director, was very interested in having Naima star in one of his musical films. The first of such films was ‚ÄúAl-E√Øch wal malh‚Äù (bread and salt). Her costar was singer Saad Abdel Wahab, the nephew of the legendary singer and composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab. The film premiered on the 17th of January 1949, and was an instant success, bringing recognition also to Nahhas Film studios. Retirement and death Naima quit acting in 1964 to take care of her only child, a son from her second marriage to accountant Salaheldeen Abdel Aleem. She died two years later from cancer, on April 23, 1966, at the age of 36.

The Act empowers the President to activate special powers during a crisis but imposes certain procedural formalities when invoking such powers. The perceived need for the law arose from the scope and number of laws granting special powers to the executive in times of national emergency. Congress can terminate an emergency declaration with a joint resolution signed into law. Powers available under this Act are limited to the 136 emergency powers Congress has defined by law. The legislation was signed by President Gerald Ford on September 14, 1976. , 60 national emergencies have been declared, more than 30 of which remain in effect. Background The first President to issue an emergency proclamation was Woodrow Wilson, who on February 5, 1917, issued the following: This proclamation was within the limits of the act that established the United States Shipping Board. The first president to declare a national emergency was President Abraham Lincoln, during the American Civil War. Starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, presidents asserted the power to declare emergencies without limiting their scope or duration, without citing the relevant statutes, and without congressional oversight.H. Rep. No. 95-459, at 7 (1977) The Supreme Court in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer limited what a president could do in such an emergency, but did not limit the emergency declaration power itself. A 1973 Senate investigation found (in Senate Report 93-549) that four declared emergencies remained in effect: the 1933 banking crisis with respect to the hoarding of gold,Executive Order 6102 a 1950 emergency with respect to the Korean War, a 1970 emergency regarding a postal workers strike, and a 1971 emergency in response to inflation. Many provisions of statutory law are contingent on a declaration of national emergency, as many as 500 by one count. It was due in part to concern that a declaration of \\"emergency\\" for one purpose should not invoke every possible executive emergency power, that Congress in 1976 passed the National Emergencies Act. Presidents have continued to use their emergency authority subject to the provisions of the act, with 42 national emergencies declared between 1976 and 2007. Most of these were for the purpose of restricting trade with certain foreign entities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701‚Äì1707). Provisions=Termination of presidential authority A prior Senate investigation had found 470 provisions of federal law that a President might invoke via a declaration of emergency.Senate Report 93-549, Emergency Powers Statutes The Act repealed several of these provisions and stated that prior emergency declarations would no longer give force to those provisions that remained. Congress did not attempt to revoke any outstanding emergency declarations per se, as these remained the President's prerogative under Article Two of the United States Constitution. Procedure for new emergencies and rescinding emergency declarations The Act authorizes the President to activate emergency provisions of law via an emergency declaration on the condition that the President specifies the provisions so activated and notifies Congress. An activation would expire if the President expressly terminated the emergency, or did not renew the emergency annually, or if each house of Congress passed a resolution terminating the emergency. After presidents objected to this \\"Congressional termination\\" provision on separation of powers grounds, and the Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha (1983) held such provisions to be an unconstitutional legislative veto, it was replaced in 1985 with termination by an enacted joint resolution. A joint resolution passed by both chambers requires presidential signature, giving the president veto power over the termination (requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses in the case of a contested termination). The Act also requires the President and executive agencies to maintain records of all orders and regulations that proceed from use of emergency authority, and to regularly report the cost incurred to Congress. Exceptions Certain emergency authorities were exempted from the act at the time of its passage: * 10 USC 2304(a)(1) ‚Äì allowing exemption of national defense contracts from competitive bidding * 10 USC 3313, 6386(c) and 8313 ‚Äì regulating the promotion, retirement and separation of military officers * 12 USC 95(a) ‚Äì regulating transactions in foreign gold and silver * 40 USC 278(b) ‚Äì regulating federal property purchases and contracts * 41 USC 15 and 203 ‚Äì limiting the assignment of claims against the federal government * 50 USC 1431‚Äì1435 ‚Äì enabling the President to make national defense contracts outside of otherwise applicable rules The list of exceptions has from time to time been revised. For example, Public Law 95-223 (1977) repealed the emergency clause of 12 USC 95(a) and arranged for its authority to expire according to the normal provisions of the NEA. Emergency powers Congress has delegated at least 136 distinct statutory emergency powers to the President, each available upon the declaration of an emergency. Only 13 of these require a declaration from Congress; the remaining 123 are assumed by an executive declaration with no further Congressional input. Congressionally- authorized emergency presidential powers are sweeping and dramatic, and range from suspending all laws regulating chemical and biological weapons, including the ban on human testing (, passed 1969); to suspending any Clean Air Act implementation plan or excess emissions penalty upon petition of a state governor (, passed 1977); to authorizing and constructing military construction projects (, passed 1982) using any existing defense appropriations for such military constructions ($10.4 billion in FY2018); to drafting any retired Coast Guard officers (, passed 1963) or enlisted members (, passed 1949) into active duty regardless of ineligibility for Selective Service. Invocations As of March 2020, 60 national emergencies had been declared, with 31 of them being renewed annually. These include the eight that were declared prior to the passage of the 1976 Act. The longest continuing national emergency dates back to November 1979 by the Carter administration blocking Iranian government property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Since passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976, every U.S. President has declared multiple national emergencies: Carter (2); Reagan: (6); H.W. Bush (4); Clinton (17); W. Bush (12); Obama: (13); Trump (7).

Pre-Socratic usage  The word œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ is a verbal noun based on œÜœçŒµŒπŒΩ \\"to grow, to appear\\" (cognate with English \\"to be\\"). In Homeric Greek it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.Odyssey 10.302-3: . (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature.) Odyssey (ed. A.T. Murray). In pre- Socratic philosophy, beginning with Heraclitus, physis in keeping with its etymology of \\"growing, becoming\\" is always used in the sense of the \\"natural\\" development, although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the Ionian School, the word could also be used in the comprehensive sense, as referring to \\"all things\\", as it were \\"Nature\\" in the sense of \\"Universe\\".Gerard Naddaf, The Greek Concept of Nature, SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3. Guthrie, W. K. C., Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus (volume 2 of his History of Greek Philosophy), Cambridge UP, 1965. In the Sophist tradition, the term stood in opposition to nomos (), \\"law\\" or \\"custom\\", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.Things in, by or according to nature are (physei; DAT sg of physis). Things in, by or according to law, custom or convention are (nom≈çi; DAT sg of nomos). The contrast of physis vs. nomos could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of \\"nature vs. nurture\\".  In Plato's Laws  In book 10 of Laws, Plato criticizes those who write works peri physe≈çs. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely \\"naturalistic\\" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of \\"intention\\" or technƒì, and thus becoming prone to the error of naive atheism. Plato accuses even Hesiod of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod \\"grow\\" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.Gerard Naddaf, The Greek Concept of Nature (2005), 1f. \\"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist by nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise.\\" ::‚Äî Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) ‚Äì translation by Benjamin Jowett  Aristotle  According to Aristotle, \\"physis\\" (nature) is dependent on \\"techne\\" (art) Aristotle sought out the definition of \\"physis\\" to prove that there was more than one definition of \\"physis\\", and more than one way to interpret nature. \\"Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of \\"physis\\" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of \\"physis\\" requires the different perspectives of the four causes (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final.\\"Atwill, Janet. \\"The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance.\\" Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print. Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of \\"physis\\" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that \\"physis\\" (nature) is dependent on techne (art). \\"The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself.\\" What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end (telos). Biblical usage Though œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul). Its meaning varies throughout Paul's writings. One usage refers to the established or natural order of things, as in Romans 2:14 where Paul writes \\"For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.\\" Another use of œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ in the sense of \\"natural order\\" is Romans 1:26 where he writes \\"the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another\\". In 1 Corinthians 11:14, Paul asks \\"Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?\\" This use of œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ as referring to a \\"natural order\\" in Romans 1:26 and 1 Corinthians 11:14 may have been influenced by Stoicism. The Greek philosophers, including Aristotle and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a natural law of universal validity, but Gerhard Kittel states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ (law) and œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ (nature) to produce the concept of \\"natural law\\" in the sense that was made possible by Judeo-Christian theology. As part of the Pauline theology of salvation by grace, Paul writes in Ephesians 2:3 that \\"we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, \\"by grace you have been saved.\\"  Usage in patristic theology  Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In Antiochene circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In Alexandrine thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to hypostasis without being a synonym.Kelly, J.N.D. Early Christian Doctrines A&C; Black(1965) p.318 While it refers to much the same thing as ousia it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.Prestige, G.L. God in Patristic Thought, SPCK (1964), p.234 Although found in the context of the Trinitarian debate, it is chiefly important in the Christology of Cyril of Alexandria.  Modern usage  The Greek adjective physikos is represented in various forms in modern English: As physics \\"the study of nature\\", as physical (via Middle Latin physicalis) referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the human body. The term physiology (physiologia) is of 16th-century coinage (Jean Fernel). The term physique, for \\"the bodily constitution of a person\\", is a 19th-century loan from French. In medicine the suffix -physis occurs in such compounds as symphysis, epiphysis, and a few others, in the sense of \\"a growth\\". The physis also refers to the \\"growth plate\\", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

Moffat (1839-1911) David Halliday Moffat (July 22, 1839 ‚Äì March 18, 1911) was an American financier and industrialist. Moffat was one of Denver's most important financiers and industrialists in late 19th and early 20th century Colorado, and he was responsible for the development of the Middle Park area. He served as president, treasurer and as a board member of railroads, banks and city government posts. Over the years he had claims to over one hundred Colorado mines and nine railroads. Moffat died on March 18, 1911 in New York City at the age of seventy three. Some had said that he had vainly spent fourteen million dollars on the dream of a railroad directly west from Denver. The Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway had cost him $75,000 a mile, and Rollins Pass had cost him the rest of his fortune. He was in New York city trying to raise more money, and was stopped by what would later be learned was the doing of E. H. Harriman and George Jay Gould I. He was one of the greatest threats they had faced in years. Although Moffat was looked at the time as a vain dreamer, he would later be viewed by many as ahead of his time. His legacy would leave Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad and later Union Pacific Railroad with a railroad that would outlast most other rail lines in Colorado. He would have Moffat Tunnel and Moffat County, Colorado named after him. History Moffat's private rail car, named for his daughter, Marcia. Built by Pullman in 1909, it is permanently based in Craig, Colorado. Moffat was born in Washingtonville, New York to David and Catherine Gregg. In 1851, when he was twelve years old, he moved to New York City, where he began work as a messenger boy in the New York Exchange Bank, now the Irving Exchange National Bank. His starting position was minor, but he was eager to learn the banking business. Moffat was noted by the president, and advanced to the position of assistant teller. In 1855 he made his way to Des Moines, Iowa and became teller in the bank of A. J. Stevens & Company. Moffat then became cashier of the Bank of Nebraska, owned by B. F. Alien, of Des Moines Iowa. He moved to Denver, Colorado in 1860 where he opened a bookstore on 15th and Larimer. The book and stationery store was not highly profitable, so after a few years he went back to banking. On April 17, 1865 the First National Bank of Denver, was organized. It had little success until 1867, when Moffat was elected cashier. He remained the controlling mind in the institution until his death, being elected to the presidency in 1880. He instituted policies and methods which led to the growth and success of the bank for years to come. Railroad involvement=Denver Pacific Railway The construction of the Denver Pacific Railway linking Cheyenne and Denver was widely credited at the time for reviving the city of Denver, which had been founded less than a decade before during the Colorado Gold Rush. The decision to build the transcontinental railroad to the north had left the Denver area stranded from the major transportation routes. As a result, Thomas Durant, vice president of the Union Pacific, pronounced Denver \\"too dead to bury.\\" Colorado Territorial Governor John Evans declared that \\"Colorado without railroads is comparatively worthless.\\" As a result, Evans, together with other local business leaders, including David Moffat, William Byers (founder of the Rocky Mountain News), Bela M. Hughes and others partnered with East Coast investors to form a railroad company that would link Denver and the Colorado Territory with the national rail network. The company was incorporated on November 19, 1867 as the \\"Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company\\". The company broke ground on its Cheyenne line on May 18, 1868, at a spot near where the Denver Coliseum now stands. The line took approximately two years to complete. It followed the South Platte River through present-day Greeley. Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad The Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad got its start in 1872 when a group of Denver businessmen headed by Colorado Governor John Evans, David Moffat, other local business leaders to form a railroad company that would link Denver and South Park and the mining country. It was a historic narrow gauge railway that operated in Colorado in the western United States in the late 19th century. The railroad opened up the first rail routes to a large section of the central Colorado mining district in the decades of the mineral boom. The railroad took its name from the fact that its main line from Denver ascended the Platte Canyon and traversed South Park. The company operated as an independent railroad from its founding in 1872 until it was sold in foreclosure proceedings in 1889. Its lines later became part of the Colorado and Southern Railway. Denver and New Orleans The Denver and New Orleans Railroad, later to be known as the Denver, Texas & Gulf Railroad and would become part of the Colorado and Southern Railway, was started by Colorado Governor John Evans, David Moffat and other associates in 1881 to give Denver an outlet to the Gulf. They built from Denver to Pueblo, when the work was taken over by General Dodge and others and completed to Fort Worth. Denver Tramway Denver Tramway was started by Colorado Governor John Evans, David Moffat and other associates in 1886. Denver Tramway was the first trolley line in Denver. Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway The Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway is an Abt system rack railway in Colorado (United States), climbing the well-known mountain Pikes Peak. The base station is in Manitou Springs, Colorado near Colorado Springs. The railway is the highest in North America by a considerable margin. It was built and is operated solely for the tourist trade. The railway was started by Zalmon G. Simmons, inventor and founder of the Simmons Beautyrest Mattress Company and David Moffat. The company was founded in 1889 and limited service to the Halfway House Hotel was started in 1890. The summit was reached the following year. Denver & Rio Grande In 1885 David Moffat was elected to Denver & Rio Grande board. Then in 1887 Moffat was elected president of the Denver & Rio Grande. Moffat built the Glenwood to Grand Junction, standard gauging Pueblo to Grand Junction, and the Tennessee pass tunnel. David H. Moffat resigned as president of D&RG; in 1891 due to foreign bondholder's displeasure with Denver management of company. Moffat had wanted to build directly west from Denver to Salt Lake City and had spent $200,000 of the D&RG;'s money on surveys in the James Peak neighborhood. He would later go on to build the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway in the same place. Creede Branch 1892 David Moffat next developed a railroad to Creede from Wagon Wheel Gap, Colorado. Along the banks of the Rio Grande to Creede, which was then a booming silver camp, where he owned mining claims. The Denver & Rio Grande Railroad wanted nothing to do with it, so Moffat built the road entirely at his own expense, forming the Rio Grande Gunnison Railway Company.Rio Grande Gunnison Railway Company Collection (MSS #889), Colorado Historical Society, Denver, Colorado. Then when it began to make a profit he sold it at a heavy profit to the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway (Moffat Line) David H. Moffat and his business associates established the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway. It originated in Denver and was planned to terminate in Salt Lake City, Utah, though it went bankrupt before reaching that city. Moffat built his own depot for his railroad at Fifteenth and Bassett, which was three blocks west of Denver's Union Station. By 1913, reorganized as the Denver & Salt Lake Railway, it reached Craig in Moffat County, Colorado, along the Colorado-Utah border. Moffat Tunnel David Moffat envisioned a tunnel through the continental divide west of Denver. Construction of the Moffat Tunnel took place from 1923 to 1927. It was officially opened on February 28, 1928 with much fanfare and several trainloads of special guests in attendance at the East Portal. D&SL; locomotive 205, a 2-6-6-0 compound locomotive, pulled the first official passenger train through the new tunnel. The Moffat Tunnel is 6.2 miles long and is the 6th largest tunnel on earth.

History The Newman School was founded as Newman Preparatory School in 1945, the centennial of John Henry Cardinal Newman's conversion to Roman Catholicism, by Dr. J. Harry Lynch and a group of Catholic laymen, for the purpose of providing college preparation to veterans returning from service to their country in World War II. Over the years, Newman Prep evolved into a co-educational, diploma-granting program, and eventually began to accept younger students into the ninth grade. During the 1960s, the school operated The Newman School for Boys as a separate four-year (grades nine through twelve) and then six-year (grades seven through twelve) college preparatory school. Walter J. Egan was head of the School for Boys during most of its existence. Now known as The Newman School and headed by J. Harry Lynch Jr., son of the founder, Newman provides a liberal arts education to a diverse group of approximately 200 American and international students. The student body is composed of students from the Greater Boston area; 50 percent of come from the city of Boston itself. International students come from Brazil, Hong Kong, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Greece, Switzerland, Thailand, Austria, Iran, Czech Republic, China, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan, among other countries.

It ran through the suburbs of Woodville, Woodville North, Pennington and Ottoway, connecting the Outer Harbor line with the Dry Creek-Port Adelaide line. It serviced four stations; Actil, Woodville North, No. 18 Shed, and Finsbury Stores. It closed in 1979 and was dismantled in 1985. Route The Finsbury line departed from the main Outer Harbor line north west of Woodville station, and headed north, parallel to the eastern side of the Cheltenham Park Racecourse, where the Actil station was located, 8.2 kilometres from Adelaide station. It crossed Torrens Road and turned due north, parallel to Audley Street through Woodville North and Glenroy Street, Pennington. The Finsbury station was located where the al-Khalil mosque now stands, at the corner of Torrens Road and Audley Street. The line then crossed Grand Junction Road and travelled parallel and between Eastern Parade and Agnes Street, before meeting the Dry Creek line. History The Finsbury line was opened in September 1940 and departed from the main Port Line at Woodville station. It headed in a northerly direction and serviced a wartime munitions works at Cheltenham Park (Actil Station) and a Government Supply Depot at Finsbury station. It was built primarily to service wartime industrial plants. Following the conclusion of the war, the industrial activity in Athol Park was maintained for a period, before declining to an extent that the Finsbury line was regarded as unnecessary, leading to its removal. A few remnants like the rail corridor and ballast at Gillman Junction, a former platform at Woodville, a goods platform and some track covered by concrete are all that exist of the line today.

Founded in 1981, initial routes connected the islands of Kauai, O'ahu, Maui and Hawaii (the Big Island). Its primary competitors were established air carriers Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Airlines. When it operated in the Midwest, its headquarters were on the grounds of Indianapolis International Airport in Indianapolis, Indiana.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International.

April 3, 1982. 852. \\"550 Palea Street, Honolulu, Hawaii 96820, USA.\\" History In contrast to Hawaiian and Aloha, Mid Pacific Air's fleet was made up primarily of NAMC YS-11 turboprop planes; Hawaiian and Aloha operated jet aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (Hawaiian) and Boeing 737 (Aloha) on the same interisland routes. Mid Pacific added Fokker F28 Fellowship twin jets in 1985. In October 1982, the airline wet leased a Boeing 707 from Arrow Air and operated a short lived service from Honolulu to Pago Pago, American Samoa using the name Mid Pacific Arrow. In 1984, Mid Pacific leased four of its YS-11's to Fort Worth Airlines in Texas, and in February 1985 it became one of that airline's largest shareholders. That same month, the airline expanded to the southwestern United States, where it operated low-fare service between from Las Vegas, Nevada and the Grand Canyon to Burbank and Orange County, California, and also flew nonstop between Orange County and Fresno, California. In January 1986, Mid Pacific was sold to KOA Holdings, and shortly thereafter the F28 jets were removed from service. Although Mid Pacific was able to lure customers with low fares and promotions that compensated for the slower, noisier turboprop aircraft, the airline was unable to compete with Hawaiian and Aloha and ended passenger flights in Hawaii on January 19, 1988, and ended cargo flights there a month later. Following the termination of the Hawaii operation, Mid Pacific moved to the midwestern United States and operated all cargo freighter flights using the YS-11s from a base in Lafayette, Indiana, and in the 1990s operated commuter service via a code sharing agreement with Reno Air under the name Reno Air Express using British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 turboprop aircraft. These Reno Air Express flights provided connecting passenger feeder service at the Reno Air hub located at the San Jose International Airport (SJC) in northern California. In 1992 and 1993, the airline operated a British Aerospace BAe 146 jet in cargo freighter service on behalf of TNT between New York City and Bermuda. The airline ceased operations in 1995.

In older switches, however, a Permanent Signal Holding Trunk (PSHT) would play either a off-hook tone (howler tone) or a 480/500 Hz high tone (which would subsequently bleed into adjacent lines via crosstalk). Off- hook tone is a tone of increasing intensity that is intended to alert telephone users to the fact that the receiver has been left off the hook without being connected in a call. Permanent signal can also describe the state of a trunk that is seized but has not been dialed upon, if it remains in a busy condition (sometimes alerting with reorder). In most mid-20th-century switching equipment, a permanent signal would tie up a junctor circuit, diminishing the ability of the switch to handle outgoing calls. When flooded cables or other conditions made this a real problem, switch staff would open the cable, or paper the off-normal contacts of the crossbar switch, or block the line relay from operating. These methods had the disadvantage of blocking all outgoing calls from that line until it was manually cleared. Manufacturers also sold devices that monitored the talk wires and held up the cutoff relay or crossbar hold magnet until the condition cleared. Some crossbar line circuit designs had a park condition allowing the line circuit itself to monitor the line. Stored program control exchanges finally solved the problem, by setting a bit mask in the scanning program and running a low priority periodic checking program against the wetlist. Depending on software version, a wetlisted line may also be in PLO or lockout state.

Early life and education Bannister was born in Steyning, Sussex, son of John Bannister. He matriculated at The Queen's College, Oxford, in December 1808 and graduated B.A. 1813, M.A. 1815.Joseph Foster Alumni Oxonienses 1715‚Äì1886 Career Bannister volunteered for active service when Napoleon escaped from Elba. With a captain's commission, he was on his way to Belgium when the Battle of Waterloo ended the war. He retired from the army on half-pay and was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn. Attorney-Generalship of New South Wales Bannister was appointed the first attorney-general of New South Wales in March 1823, and he arrived in Sydney early in 1824. On 17 May 1824, he was sworn in at the first sitting of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He had been given a salary of ¬£1,200 a year with the right to practise as a barrister, but he became discontented with his position; in October 1825, he was in conflict with Governor Thomas Brisbane on the question whether he was bound to draft a bill which seemed to him to be repugnant to the laws of England. Bannister appeared to have taken his office and his responsibilities far too seriously; and, though Governor Ralph Darling spoke of Bannister as \\"often misled by an injudicious zeal, but indefatigable, conscientious and honourable in the highest degree\\", Bannister found it extremely difficult to work with him. In September 1826, in a dispatch to under-secretary Hay, Darling described one of Bannister's letters to the governor as \\"very offensive and insolent\\". Resignation as Attorney-General of New South Wales In April 1826, Bannister wrote to Darling to say that he could no longer hold his office at its present remuneration. On 13 October 1826, he was informed that his resignation had been accepted. This furnished Bannister with a grievance for the rest of his long life. He left for England on 22 October 1826 and afterwards did a large amount of writing; the British Museum Catalogue lists about 30 of his publications. Many are pamphlets but among the longer works are: Statements and Documents relating to Proceedings in New South Wales in 1824, 1825 and 1826 (1827), Humane Policy; or Justice to the Aborigines (1830), British Colonization and Coloured Tribes (1838), and William Paterson, the Merchant Statesman (1858). Death Bannister died at Thornton Heath, England, on 16 September 1877, survived by his wife and a daughter, Mrs Wyndham.

According to the local historian Myrsilus of Methymna, local tradition held that the head of Orpheus had floated south from the Hebros after he was decapitated and floated south to land on the shore of Antissan territory: the spot was marked by a tomb where, according to Myrsilus, the nightingales sang more sweetly than they did elsewhere.Myrsilus of Methymna FGrHist 477 F 2 = Antigonus of Carystus, Historiarum Mirabilium 5. Foundation Almost nothing is known about the early history of Antissa. The late 1st century AD writer Herennius Philo claimed that Antissa was named after the homonymous daughter of Macar, the legendary king of Lesbos.Philo, Brill's New Jacoby 790 F 26 = Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. ·ºåŒΩœÑŒπœÉœÉŒ±. An anonymous scholiast commenting on Homer alternatively claimed that the Antissa in question was Macar's wife.Œ£ vet. Homer, Iliad 24.544c. Since the practice of positing mythical figures to explain the origins of otherwise unexplained toponyms was common - for example, the same is claimed of Methymna, Mt. Lepetymnos, Mytilene, Eresos and Lesbos itself - this tradition about Macar and a female relative named Antissa only indicates that the Greeks themselves did not know the origin of the name.Diodorus Siculus 5.8.6-7, Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. ·ºúœÅŒµœÉŒøœÇ. An alternative tradition attempted to etymologize (Antissa) as (ant' Issa), exploiting the meaning 'opposite to' of the Greek preposition (anti). Re-dividing toponyms to yield explanations for their origin was a common practice, and in this region we encounter it, for example, in the mythological tradition for Antandros in the Troad.Antandros: Foundation. This tradition appears to originate with Myrsilus, a local historian from neighbouring Methymna who wrote in the first half of the 3rd century BCE. He wrote that Antissa was formerly an island, so called because it was 'opposite Issa', which at that time, he claims, was the name of Lesbos.Myrsilus of Methymna FGrHist 477 F 16 = Strabo 1.3.19. In addition to Strabo, Myrsilus is also followed by Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis 2.204, 206 and Ovid, Metamorphoses 15.287-8. This tradition appears to reflect the situation of Antissa's promontory, which was located on a low rise (elevation ~13 metres) jutting out to sea a short distance from its acropolis.W. Lamb, 'Antissa' The Annual of the British School at Athens 31 (1930-1931) 166. The excavator of Antissa, Winnifred Lamb, noted that subsistence was a problem in the low-lying land between the promontory and the acropolis, and so the tradition may relate to an actual change in the landscape; alternatively, it could be the product of learned speculation.W. Lamb, 'Antissa' The Annual of the British School at Athens 31 (1930-1931) 167. Another interpretation is that the name Antissa comes from the Hittite words \\"hanti i≈°a\\", meaning \\"near the face\\", in the sense \\"near the port\\". History Antissa joined the Mytilenaeans in their revolt from Athens in 428 BCE during the Peloponnesian war, and successfully defended itself against the Methymnaeans who attacked it.Thucydides 3.18.1-2. But after Mytilene had been compelled to surrender to the Athenians, Antissa was recovered by them also.Thucydides 3.28.3. In 371 the Athenian general Iphicrates fled to Antissa, and later to Drys, after he fell out with his father-in-law Cotys, King of the Thracians, when he refused to besiege the strongholds of his fellow Athenians in the Thracian Chersonese.Demosthenes 23.132. In the 330s BCE was ruled by a tyranny which also controlled the neighbouring city of Eresos until it was overthrown by the forces of Alexander the Great in 332.Pseudo-Demosthenes 17.7. Antissa was destroyed by the Romans after the defeat of Perseus, king of Macedonia in 168 BCE because the Antissans had received in their port and given supplies to Antenor, the admiral of Perseus. The people were removed to Methymna.Livy 45.31.13-14, Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis 5.139, H. J. Mason, 'The end of Antissa' American Journal of Philology 116.3 (1995) 399-410. Archaeological excavations carried out by Winifred Lamb for the British School of Archaeology at Athens revealed parts of the city wall and Iron Age buildings including an apsidal structure.W. Lamb, 'Antissa' The Annual of the British School at Athens 32 (1931-1932) 42-8. The original island site is now joined to the mainland by a sandy isthmus; its most conspicuous remains are those of a medieval castle. Traces of the harbour mole may also be seen on the eastern side of the city. In popular culture Antissa is the name of the first song in the first album by the band E.S. Posthumus, 'Unearthed'. All of the songs in that album are named after historical cities.

It is a retelling of part of the Old English poem Beowulf from the perspective of the antagonist, Grendel. In the novel, Grendel is portrayed as an antihero. The novel deals with finding meaning in the world, the power of literature and myth, and the nature of good and evil. In a 1973 interview, Gardner said that \\"In Grendel I wanted to go through the main ideas of Western civilization ‚Äì which seemed to me to be about ... twelve? ‚Äì and go through them in the voice of the monster, with the story already taken care of, with the various philosophical attitudes (though with Sartre in particular), and see what I could do, see if I could break out\\".Joe Don Bellamy & Pat Ensworth, \\"John Gardner\\", in Conversations With John Gardner, Allan Chavkin, ed., University Press of Mississippi, 1990, p.10 On another occasion he noted that he \\"us[ed] Grendel to represent Sartre's philosophical position\\" and that \\"a lot of Grendel is borrowed from sections of Sartre's Being and Nothingness\\".Barry Silesky, John Gardner: Literary Outlaw, Algonquin Books, 2004, p.165 Grendel has become one of Gardner's best-known and best-reviewed works. Several editions of the novel contain pen and ink line drawings of Grendel's head, by Emil Antonucci. Ten years after publication, the novel was adapted into the 1981 animated film Grendel Grendel Grendel. Background The basic plot derives from Beowulf, a heroic poem of unknown authorship written in Old English and preserved in a manuscript dating from around AD 1000. The poem deals with the heroic exploits of the Geat warrior Beowulf, who battles three antagonists: Grendel, Grendel's mother, and, later in life, an unnamed dragon. Gardner's retelling, however, presents the story from the existentialist view of Grendel, exploring the history of the characters before Beowulf arrives. Beowulf himself plays a relatively small role in the novel, but he is still the only human hero that can match and kill Grendel. The dragon plays a minor part as an omniscient and bored character, whose wisdom is limited to telling Grendel \\"to seek out gold and sit on it\\"; his one action in the novel is to endow Grendel with the magic ability to withstand attacks by sword (a quality Gardner found in the original). Gardner himself explained that his Grendel character is modeled on Jean-Paul Sartre, with whom Gardner claimed to have a love-hate relationship: \\"he's a horror intellectually, figuratively, and morally, but he's a wonderful writer and anything he says you believe, at least for the moment, because of the way he says it ... What happened in Grendel was that I got the idea of presenting the Beowulf monster as Jean-Paul Sartre, and everything that Grendel says Sartre in one mood or another has said\\". Plot In the opening scene, Grendel briefly fights with a ram when frustrated with its stupidity. He then mockingly asks the sky why animals lack sense and dignity; the sky does not reply, adding to his frustration. Grendel then passes through his cave and encounters his mute mother before venturing out into the night where he attacks Hrothgar's mead hall, called \\"Hart\\" in Grendel. Later, Grendel reminisces about his early experiences in life, beginning with his childhood days of exploring the caves inhabited by him, his mother and other creatures with which he is unable to speak. One day, however, he arrives at a pool filled with firesnakes, which he enters. Upon exiting, he eventually becomes wedged and trapped in a tree. Helpless, he eventually falls asleep, only to wake surrounded by humans. Although Grendel can understand the humans, they cannot understand him and they become frightened, which leads to a fight between Grendel and the Danish warriors, including Hrothgar. Grendel is barely saved from death at the hands of the humans by the appearance of his mother. During Hrothgar's rise to prominence, a blind poet appears at the doors of Hart, whom Grendel calls \\"the Shaper\\". He tells the story of the ancient warrior Scyld Shefing, which enraptures and seduces Grendel. The monster reacts violently to the power the beautiful myth has on him and flees. Grendel continues to be enraptured by the tales. After seeing a corpse and two lovers juxtaposed, he drags the corpse to Hart, bursting into the hall and begging for mercy and peace. The thegns do not comprehend his actions and see this as an attack, driving him from the hall. While fleeing the men, he curses them, yet still returns later to hear the rest of the Shaper's songs, half enraptured and half enraged. When Grendel returns to his cave, he attempts and fails to communicate with his mother, thus leaving him with a sense of total loneliness. He becomes filled with despair and falls through the sea, finding himself in an enormous cave filled with riches and a dragon. The omniscient dragon reveals to Grendel that the power of the Shaper is simply the ability to make the logic of humans seem real, despite the fact his lore possesses no factual basis. The dragon and Grendel cannot agree about the dragon's statements that existence is a chain reaction of accidents, and Grendel exits the cave in a mixed state of confusion, anger, and denial. While listening to the Shaper, he is spotted by sentries, who try to fight him off again, but he discovers that the dragon has enchanted him, leaving him impervious to weapons. Realizing his power, he begins attacking Hart, viewing his attacks as a perpetual battle. Grendel is challenged by a thane named Unferth, to which he responds mockingly. Grendel awakens a few days later to realize that Unferth has followed him to his cave in an act of heroic desperation. He continues to mock Unferth until the Dane passes out from exhaustion, then takes him back to Hart to live out his days in frustrated mediocrity, stopping him from having a heroic death. In the second year of the war, Grendel notes that his raids have destroyed the esteem of Hrothgar, allowing a rival noble named Hygmod to gain power. Fearing deposition, Hrothgar assembles an army to attack Hygmod and his people, the Helmings. Instead of a fight, Hygmod offers his sister Wealtheow to Hrothgar as a wife after a series of negotiations. The beauty of Wealtheow moves Grendel as the Shaper had once before, keeping the monster from attacking Hart just as she prevents internal conflicts among the Danes. Eventually, Grendel decides to kill Wealtheow, since she threatens the ideas explained by the dragon. Upon capturing her, he realizes that killing and not killing are equally meaningless, and he retreats, knowing that by not killing Wealtheow, he has once again confounded the logic of humanity and religion. Later, Grendel watches as Hrothgar's nephew Hrothulf develops his understanding of the two classes in Danish society: thegns and peasants, then further explores them with a peasant named Red Horse, who teaches Hrothulf that government exists only for the protection of those in power. Grendel watches a religious ceremony and is approached by an old priest named Ork, who thinks that Grendel is their main deity, the Destroyer, and engages him in conversation. When three other priests approach and chastise Ork, Grendel flees, overwhelmed with a vague dread. Watching the Danes, Grendel hears a woman predict the coming of an illustrious thegn and then witnesses the death of the Shaper. Returning to his cave, his mother seems agitated. She manages to make one unusual unintelligible word, which Grendel discounts, and then goes to the Shaper's funeral. Later, in the cave, he wakes up with his mother still making word-like noises, and once again feels a terrible foreboding. Grendel reveals that fifteen travellers have come to Denmark from over the sea, almost as though the way was set before them. The visitors, who reveal themselves to be Geats ruled by Hygelac, have an uneasy relationship with the Danes. Upon their arrival, Grendel notices the firm nature of their leader, Beowulf, and the fact that his lips do not move in accordance with his words, and sees a great lust for violence in Beowulf's eyes, convincing Grendel he is insane. At nightfall, Grendel attacks. When he believes that all the men are asleep, he breaks into the hall and eats one man. Grabbing the wrist of another, he realizes that it is an alert Beowulf, and that he has grabbed his arm. They wrestle furiously, during which Beowulf appears to become a flaming, dragon-like figure and repeats many of the ideas that the dragon revealed to Grendel. The Geat slams Grendel into the walls of the hall, then rips off Grendel's arm, causing the monster to flee in pain and fear. Grendel proceeds to toss himself into an abyss (whether or not Grendel jumps is left up to the perception of the reader), and dies wondering if what he is feeling is joy, understanding what the dragon meant by the accident statement, and cursing existence. Characters  Gardner includes all featured characters from the original poem in his novel, but greatly changes many roles. Beowulf himself, for example, appears only in the last portion of the novel and has little dialogue or interaction with other characters. The author also introduces a handful of incidental minor characters. *Grendel ‚Äì the main protagonist and self-described monster, given the narrator's voice in the novel. *Grendel's mother ‚Äì another antagonist from Beowulf who lives in an underwater cave with her son. Unlike her son, she is incapable of speech and holds no curiosity of the world outside her cave. *Beowulf ‚Äì a Geatish hero who ultimately kills Grendel. He is never referred to by name in the novel. He is given qualities similar to the dragon *Hrothgar ‚Äì warrior and king of the Danes. *The Shaper ‚Äì a blind harpist and storyteller in Hrothgar's court. He creates the Dane's image of Grendel as a threat by telling fictional stories. *The Shaper's assistant ‚Äì the young apprentice who replaces the Shaper upon his death. *Unferth ‚Äì a Scylding warrior who challenges but fails to defeat Grendel. *Wealtheow ‚Äì queen of the Danes and wife to Hrothgar. *Hrothulf ‚Äì Hrothgar's orphaned nephew. *Freawaru ‚Äì Hrothgar's teenage daughter. *Hygmod ‚Äì King of the Helmings and Wealtheow's brother. *The dragon ‚Äì an ancient, omniscient beast guarding a vast hoard of treasure to whom Grendel goes for advice. It possibly is a figment of Grendel's imagination. It is also possible the dragon was meant to be the same dragon that appeared in the epic poem Beowulf as he does reference how he has foreseen his own death at the hands of a human, he also alludes that his death would be the end of his kind implying that he is the last dragon. *Red Horse ‚Äì Hrothulf's elderly advisor. *Ork ‚Äì an old and blind Scylding priest. Portrayal of Grendel Pulitzer Prize winning author Jane Smiley suggests that John Gardner uses Grendel as a metaphor for the necessity for a dark side to everything; where a hero is only as great as the villain he faces. Using Grendel's perspective to tell at least part of the story of Beowulf in more contemporary language allows the story to be seen in a new light not only in terms of the point of view but also brings it into the modern era. Where Grendel is portrayed mainly as a physical creature in the original work, here a glimpse into his psyche is offered. Grendel lives in isolation and loneliness with his mother, who in her old age is unable to provide any real companionship to her child. As the only being of his kind, he has no one to relate to and feels the need to be understood or have some connection. Grendel has a complex relationship with the humans who hate and fear him. He feels that he is somehow related to humanity and despite his desire to eat them, he can be moved by them and their works. His long life grants him the ability to act as a witness to how their lives transpire and their behavior and logic bewilders him. He is cursed to a life of solitude, also being portrayed as having eternal life, which furthers his plight and loneliness as he can only fall in battle and he is immune to all human weapons. He is only freed from his tormented life through his encounter with Beowulf.Smiley, Jane. 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel. Toronto: Random House of Canada, 2005. Film adaptations An Australian-produced animated movie, Grendel Grendel Grendel, based on Gardner's novel, was released in 1981, in limited quantities on VHS.

In 2004 the soundtrack to the film, by Bruce Smeaton, was released on the 1M1 Records label. Reception D. Keith Mano praised Grendel lavishly in The New York Times Book Review, saying: \\"John Gardner's Grendel is myth itself: permeated with revelation, with dark instincts, with swimming, riotous universals. The special profundity of Gardner's vision or visions is so thought-fertile that it shunts even his fine poet's prose to a second importance\\".\\"Grendel\\", The New York Times Book Review, September 19, 1971, p. 6. Another Times reviewer, Richard Locke, declared the novel \\"an extraordinary achievement ‚Äì very funny, original and deft, altogether lovable, poignant, rich with thought and feeling\\".\\"Grendel Is a Beauty of a Beast\\", The New York Times, September 4, 1971. Kirkus Reviews also reviewed Grendel favorably, saying \\"Gardner demonstrates his agility at juggling metaphysical notions while telling a diverting tale\\".Grendel review The book was nominated for the 1972 Mythopoeic Award for best novel.1972 Mythopoeic Award. It was given special mention by Diana Athill in her memoir Stet, covering her decades as an editor with UK publisher Andr√© Deutsch: \\"Having to read Beowulf almost turned me against Oxford, so when a New York agent offered me this novel I could hardly bring myself to open it. If I hadn't, I would have missed a great pleasure ‚Äì a really powerful feat of imagination.\\"Diana Athill, Stet: An Editor's Life, Granta Books, 2000. Musical adaptations=Rock In 1982, the British neo-progressive rock band Marillion recorded a 17-minute opus entitled \\"Grendel\\" that was based on the book.

The tone characteristics vary by country or telephone administrations. In North America it is a dual-frequency tone of 620 Hz and 480 Hz interrupted 120 times per minute at a cadence of 0.25 seconds on, 0.25 off, i.e., two beeps per second. The British reorder tone is the same 400 Hz tone as the busy tone, instead with a cadence of 0.4 seconds on, 0.35 seconds off, 0.225 seconds on, 0.525 seconds off. The signal is used to indicate that the destination is unreachable, either because all circuits (trunks) are busy, the called number is out of service, the call is unroutable, or sometimes that an invalid code has been dialed. A PBX also often indicates an invalid extension, while dialing an invalid telephone number on the PSTN usually results in playing the triple special information tone and a recorded announcement. Many telephone companies in North America and in the United Kingdom often play the reorder tone after the reading of a recorded announcement explaining the reason of call failure, typically when the other party fails to receive the call after ringing for several minutes. The reorder tone is sometimes confused with the busy signal because they use the same frequencies and differ only in that the busy signal's beeping sounds have a slower cadence than those of the reorder tone.

He is widely known for performing the opening and closing themes for the popular TV series, The Boondocks, as well as his pioneering and innovative efforts to forward the Hip Hop Education movement. Early life As a youth, many of Asheru's musical influences came from a wide range of Hip Hop artists such as Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-One, Public Enemy, N.W.A, Slick Rick, Doug E. Fresh, Native Tongues, Pharoahe Monch, and more, as well as the classic Soul, R&B;, and Pop records of the 1970s and 1980s eras that his mother used to play throughout the house. At the age of 16, he graduated from high school and attended the University of Virginia, where he finished in 1996 with a B.A. degree in Anthropology. In the college, he formed relationships with colleagues, a group of like-minded individuals that shared a similar passion for Hip Hop music and the collective Black experience. After college, one of those colleagues, Wesley Jackson, founded an independent Hip Hop label, Seven Heads Entertainment, and in 1996 signed its first group, Unspoken Heard, made up primarily of Asheru and Jackson's older brother, Robert Jackson, also known as ‚ÄúBlue Black\\". Asheru and Blue Black went on to release a series of 12‚Äù singles and EPs, and in 2001 released their first album, ‚ÄúSoon Come‚Äù, a critically acclaimed debut, still widely considered a classic in many Hip Hop circles. In 2003, the group released their second album ‚Äú48 Months‚Äù, followed by the ‚ÄúNo Edge Ups in South Africa‚Äù album, a compilation album of other 7 Heads artists featuring the hit, ‚ÄúMood Swing‚Äù with Talib Kweli. Asheru, both as a solo artist as well as with the group Unspoken Heard, has gone on to travel extensively throughout Europe, Canada, the US and Japan, performing alongside artists and groups like Common, Mos Def, Jill Scott, Bilal, Ludacris, Edo G, J-Live, Wordsworth, and The Roots, while collaborating and being featured on projects with Hip Hop greats such as Pete Rock, and DJ Jazzy Jeff. His lyrics are categorized by reflection upon the state of affairs of the current-day Black American. Through his music, he demonstrates a desire to improve the attitude of Black people towards liberation through education and self-empowerment. He currently travels with a live band, The ELs, made up of a three (sometimes four)-piece band of accomplished veteran musicians and producers, namely SLimkat 78, Mr. Hu, and Zo!. The Boondocks Asheru collaborated with Aaron McGruder to write and perform several songs for the hit TV series,The Boondocks, including the show's theme song. Asheru's contribution to the controversial \\"Return of the King\\" episode of the Boondocks series helped him to earn the prestigious Peabody Award for Journalism in 2006, making him the first rapper (emcee) to win such an award. Education Alongside his career as a hip hop artist Asheru has also served as a teacher within Washington, DC Schools since 1997, specializing in curriculum development and arts-based instruction. In 2004, he went on to earn a Master's degree in Education from National-Louis University.

She was Shi Hu (Emperor Wu)'s first empress, but not his first wife. Life Zheng Yingtao became a concubine of Shi Hu's, apparently when he was in his late teens, circa 312. Traditional historians implied that she was a prostitute before becoming Shi Hu's concubine. Shi Hu favored her greatly, and she was purportedly involved in persuading him to kill his first two wives, Lady Guo and Lady Cui. She bore him at least two sons, his oldest son Shi Sui (Áü≥ÈÇÉ) and Shi Zun. In 333, after the death of Shi Hu's uncle Shi Le, the founding emperor of Later Zhao, Shi Hu quickly took power in a coup, holding Shi Le's heir Shi Hong as a puppet, and he forced Shi Hong to create him the Prince of Wei. Lady Zheng was created the Princess of Wei, and her son Shi Sui the Crown Prince of Wei. Empress After Shi Hu deposed Shi Hong in 334, he did not immediately give Princess Zheng a greater title, but after he claimed the \\"Heavenly Prince\\" (Tian Wang) title in 337, he created her empress and created Shi Sui crown prince. Later that year, however, after discovering that Shi Sui, unable to stand his constant rebukes and whippings, had plotted to kill him, he killed Shi Sui and deposed Empress Zheng to the title of Duchess Dowager of Donghai. (This title implied that she had another son who was the Duke of Donghai, but historians did not record who was the Duke of Donghai; it did not appear to be Shi Zun's title, since he was the Duke of Pengcheng.) The empress title went to Du Zhu. Empress dowager Nothing further was recorded of her activities until Shi Hu's death in 349. Initially, Shi Hu's youngest son Shi Shi was proclaimed emperor pursuant to Shi Hu's wishes, but Shi Zun soon overthrew him and his mother Empress Dowager Liu in a coup and claimed imperial title. The former Empress Zheng became empress dowager, and Shi Zun consulted her on major decisions. In late 349, Shi Zun, at a meeting with a number of his brothers and Empress Dowager Zheng attending, announced a plan to execute Shi Min the Duke of Wuxing‚ÄîShi Hu's adopted grandson and a fierce general, but one whose ambitions had made Shi Zun apprehensive of him. The princes all announced agreement, but Empress Dowager Zheng opposed, reasoning that Shi Min had contributed much to Shi Zun's coup against Shi Shi and it would be ungrateful to execute him. Shi Zun hesitated, while one of his brothers, Shi Jian the Prince of Yiyang, reported the plot to Shi Min, who quickly surrounded Shi Zun's palace and executed him.

After the invasion of Poland in World War II, in December 1939 Pogonowski, aged 18, left Warsaw with the intent of joining the Polish Armed Forces in the West. He was arrested in Dukla by the German authorities on suspicion of aiming to join the resistance. He was moved between prisons and camps for five years thereafter. Interned at the Krosno, Jas≈Ço, and Tarn√≥w prisons among others, he was sent with 500 prisoners to Auschwitz, and from there, several months later, to Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen.

After the second army mutiny of 1996, he and Jean Serge Ouafio set up the 'Karako' militia forces, which Patass√© then brought into the military to balance the predominance of southern Yakoma in the armed forces inherited from the Kolingba era. After attending a dinner to celebrate the first anniversary of Patass√©'s second term on 21 October 2000, Mandaba suddenly felt sick and died at home of a heart attack. His family claimed that Mandaba was in fact poisoned at the dinner party, as he supposedly was thought to be planning a coup to overthrow Patass√©. Their suspicion was strongly supported when his 31-year-old son Herv√© died under similar circumstances a few weeks later. He performed a final surgery hours before he died.

In Islamic belief, revelations are God's Word delivered by his chosen individuals ‚Äì known as Messenger prophets ‚Äì to mankind. Quran In Islam, the Quran is considered a wahy given to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The word awha ( ') occurs in a number of shades of meaning in the Quran, each of them indicating the main underlying idea of directing or guiding someone or something. For example, \\"And inspired in each heaven its command,\\" (Fussilat-12). \\"And your lord inspired to the bee,\\" (An Nahl-68). \\"And we inspired to the mother of Mosses,\\" (Al Qasas-7). Islamic scholars say that there is a clear difference between these kind of wahy and wahy to the Messenger Prophet. The prophets were very much conscious about revelations and they firmly believed that the revelations were true and came from the Almighty God. The word wahy (revelation) is derived from awha. In Islamic tradition, Quran 42:51 serves as the basis of understanding for Wa·∏•y. :\\"It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah's permission, what Allah wills\\".Abdullah Yusuf Ali Based on this, Islamic scholars have described three ways in which God's revelation can reach his chosen individuals, especially prophets.Muhammad Shafi Usmani, Maariful Quran, see commentary on 42:51 * An inspired message ‚Äì not a word but an idea ‚Äì can enter the heart of the chosen individuals either in the state of consciousness or in dream. * The second mode, it is said, is the word heard by the person spoken to, like, from behind a veil. * In the third mode, the revelation is sent from God through archangels like Gabriel and is delivered to the prophets. It is the highest form of revelation, and Muslims believe the whole Quran was revealed in this mode. Purpose According to Islamic scholar Muhammad Shafi Usmani, God has created three media through which humans receive knowledge: the senses, the faculty of reason, and the divine revelation; and it is the third one that addresses the liturgical and eschatological issues, answers the questions regarding God's purpose behind creating mankind, and acts as a guidance for the mankind as to choosing the correct way. In Islamic belief, the sequence of divine revelation came to an end with Muhammad. Mode of descent As regard to revelation received by Muhammad, Muslim sources mention various modes in which they believe revelation came to him. Muslim scholar Muhammad Shafi Usmani has summarized five modes of descent. The common mode was that Muhammad would hear sound like \\"the ringing of a bell\\" after which he found the message committed to his memory. Sometimes, the archangel would come in human shape, most often of Dahya al-Kalbi. In two cases, Gabriel appeared in his real form. Once, on the night of Miraj, Muhammad is believed to have had a direct conversation with God. In the fifth mode, Gabriel would let the revelation enter into Muhammad‚Äôs heart.

Buk have been used for Korean music since the period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BC ‚Äì 668 AD) in light of mural paintings in Anak Tomb of Goguryeo (37 BC ‚Äì 668 AD) and records of Book of Sui on the kingdoms, Goguryeo and Baekje (18 BC ‚Äì 660 AD).

He was the President of the Civic Forum party. Early life Timoth√©e Malendoma was born in Dekou (now in the Central African Republic) in 1935, joining the French Army in 1953. After fighting for France in the First Indochina War, he was trained as a military administrator in Montpellier. Political career He was chosen by President Jean-B√©del Bokassa to become Minister of the National Economy in January 1966, and spent his time attempting to shut down diamond smuggling. However, the following year the influence of the smugglers proved too great and he was removed from his post. He returned to politics on 27 September 1979 when he was named Minister of State in the government of President David Dacko. He later formed his own political party in 1990. Under Malendoma's leadership, the Civic Forum party participated in the \\"grand national debate\\" initiated by President Andr√© Kolingba in 1992, although such participation was opposed by the Consultative Group of Democratic Forces, an opposition coalition of which the Civic Forum was a member, which resulting in a suspension of the party by the coalition. On 4 December 1992, Malendoma was appointed as Prime Minister of the Central African Republic by Kolingba to succeed Edouard Frank; however, in February 1993, Kolingba accused Malendoma of \\"blocking the democratic process\\" and dismissed him. Malendoma was the candidate of the Civic Forum in the August 1993 presidential election, receiving 2.03% of the vote and taking sixth place. Subsequently Malendoma was a deputy in the National Assembly and the Civic Forum was an opposition party under President Ange-F√©lix Patass√©. As President of the Church of Christ - the King and the Faculty of Evangelical Theology of Bangui, he sought to attend a meeting of Protestant churches in New Caledonia but was barred from leaving the Central African Republic by the government on 12 October 1999. After Fran√ßois Boziz√© seized power in 2003, Malendoma remained in opposition. In March 2004 he objected to the presence of ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in the Central African Republic, arguing that Aristide was \\"a dictator\\"--\\"we have had our fair share and we don't need anymore\\"--and that the country should not be \\"a dumping ground\\". He also said that in the Central African Republic \\"democracy is a luxury and opposition is a foreign concept\\". In the 2005 parliamentary election, he ran for a seat in the National Assembly as a candidate of the Civic Forum from Mala constituency in K√©mo Prefecture, but was defeated in the second round of voting by Fred Jacob Karouna. Death Malendoma was admitted to Bangui General Hospital in late November 2010 suffering from a hypertensive emergency, and died on 12 December at the age of 75. Following his death, the Civic Forum did not participate in the subsequent election.

She was Shi Hu (Emperor Wu)'s third and final empress. She served as regent in 349. Life The future Empress Liu was the youngest daughter of the final Han Zhao emperor Liu Yao. After her father was captured by Later Zhao's founding emperor Shi Le in 329, she accompanied her brothers Liu Xi the Crown Prince and Liu Yin the Prince of Nanyang in fleeing from the Han Zhao capital Chang'an to Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu). Later that year, Liu Yin tried to recapture Chang'an and was defeated by Shi Hu, who marched on to Shanggui and captured it, killing Liu Xi and Liu Yin. She was captured by his subordinate Zhang Chai (ÂºµË±∫) and offered to him. She, at 11, became his concubine. In 339, she gave birth to his youngest son, Shi Shi. He was created the Duke of Qi. Empress In 348, after executing his second crown prince Shi Xuan (Áü≥ÂÆ£) for having assassinated his younger brother Shi Tao (Áü≥Èüú) and for plotting against himself, Shi Hu considered whom to make his new crown prince. Zhang, believing that he could hold power jointly with Consort Liu if she were to become empress dowager, suggested to Shi Hu that the reasons why his prior crown princes rebelled was that their mothers were of low birth. Shi Hu agreed, and he created Shi Shi crown prince and Consort Liu empress. Regent In early 349, Shi Hu grew ill, and he ordered that his sons Shi Zun the Prince of Pengcheng and Shi Bin (Áü≥Êñå) the Prince of Yan be made joint regents for Shi Shi. This interfered with Empress Liu's and Zhang's plans to control the government, and they issued false edicts sending Shi Zun away and executing Shi Bin. Shi Hu soon died, and Shi Shi succeeded him. Empress Liu became empress dowager, and she served as regent, holding power jointly with Zhang. She tried to placate Shi Zun and Shi Jian the Prince of Yiyang by giving them high posts. However, Shi Zun did not accept and marched on the capital Yecheng. Empress Dowager Liu tried to placate him by offering him the regent office and the nine bestowments, but that could not stop him from entering the capital and seizing power. He executed Zhang, and then forged an edict by Empress Dowager Liu deposing Shi Shi and giving him the throne. Shi Shi was created the Prince of Qiao, and Empress Dowager Liu was given the title of Princess Dowager of Qiao, but soon Shi Zun executed both of them.

It screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film opens up with an assassination attempt on the king of Joseon Dynasty at some sort of reception. The attempt is foiled by a special security squad, and specifically by its leader, Gyu-yup. A series of deaths of prominent politicians leads to a nighttime battle in which one member, a female, of what is apparently an assassin duo, is captured. Gyu-yup recognizes this female, and after her torture in prison (of which Gyu-yup is left in charge when she refuses to divulge any information), the film flashes back to Gyu-yup's past. Shortly after the Japanese invasions of Korea in the middle of the Joseon Dynasty, a military unit of elite soldiers (made up of students of the Clear Wind Shining Moon sword school) is created to ensure the peace and the security/safety of the country. In its center, the two best swordsmen, Ji-hwan and Gyu-yup, are also two inseparable friends. But a political coup d'etat plot (it is referred to as a \\"rebellion\\" in the film) forces Gyu-yup, threatened with the death of his entire unit of elite soldiers, to not only kill his fencing master, but also Ji-hwan, who is seeing the female assassin from the night battle, Shi-young (who was also a warrior at the time, and the daughter of the school's fencing master). Having had to behead his master, kill his best friend and his best friend's lover, and lead his troops against members of their own training school (as one character protests, \\"we have killed the brothers with whom we shed blood\\"), we are led to understand that Gyu-yup loses some part of himself. The film returns to the present, five years after the events in the flashback. Gyu-yup is known as a cold and cruel commander, nicknamed \\"the human butcher.\\" The discovery of a sword during the night battle that carries the seal of Gyu-yup's old unit (such swords, with the exception of Gyu-yup's, were apparently destroyed and at least not in use by this time, so the only other person who could be wielding one is Ji-hwan) confirms the fact that Ji-hwan is back as well (and not dead as Gyu-yup had thought). The current king (the usurper general who, in Gyu-yup's flashback, is the commander who forces him to choose between the deaths of his men and leading his men against Ji-hwan, Shi-young, and the training master) himself becomes embroiled in what amount to attempts to cover up his tracks and betrays at least one of his foremost commanders by ordering his assassination. The king then plans an excursion aimed at drawing out Ji-hwan and Shi-young (who we are made to understand was allowed to be freed by Ji-hwan in disguise under Gyu-yup's watch) into the open where they are meant to be killed. The excursion (of which Ji-hwan and Shi-young become aware) takes place, and the king is almost killed by Ji-hwan, but he is momentarily distracted by the death of Shi-young at the hands of the king's elite bodyguard and troops. The king, stabbing Ji-hwan with a heretofore hidden dagger, pushes Ji-hwan away; and the king continues to look on as Ji-hwan battles more troops. Almost defeated, Gyu-yup, finally moved by compassion and his past relationship with Shi-young and Ji-hwan, comes to Ji-hwan's rescue. He pleads for his and Ji- hwan's freedom (Gyu-yup had promised his neck to the current king during the rebellion in order to save his own troops from execution, and the now-king took this to mean this promise was binding in perpetuity), and when that is met with silence, he and Ji-hwan engage the troops that have surrounded them. The movie ends by freezing the old friends, united in battle again, in action against the usurper king's troops.

The design of the flag is based on the British Civil Air Ensign, which is divided into quarters by a dark blue cross with a white fimbriation. There is a Union Jack in the upper hoist quarter, and the other quarters light blue. When an Australian version was first adopted in 1935, it included the stars from the Australian National Flag in yellow, and with the Southern Cross rotated by roughly 45 degrees, meaning that the smallest star was completely inside the arm of the blue cross. In 1948, the colour of the stars was changed to white to improve the flag's recognition when viewed from a long distance. Originally, civil air ensigns were intended to be flown at airports and by civilian aircraft on the ground. While the practice of flying flags from landed aircraft has not commonly continued, this flag has been used by agencies such as the Civil Aviation Authority and is still used by the Minister for Transport.

The initial paid up capital of SR 1 million (US$267,000) was subsequently increased to the present level of SR 750 million (US$200 million). Saudi Oger was a private company, wholly owned by the Rafik Hariri family. After struggling for a long period, Saudi Oger closed down on 31 July 2017.  Business lines  The Oger Telecommunications subsidiary provides fixed-line and mobile communication, and Internet services in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, and South Africa. In 2008, Saudi Telecom Company (STC), acquired Oger Telecom for $2.56 billion with a 35% stake in the company. Criticism Due to alleged mismanagement, corruption and falling oil prices, Saudi Oger suffered a significant financial impact, and failed to provide monthly salaries to its employees as of November 2015. The French government appealed to the government of Saudi Arabia to assist 200 distressed French employees of Saudi Oger. About 9,000 Filipino workers were appealing to both local officials and their country‚Äôs embassy to help them resolve their escalating labor problem in terms of eight to nine months‚Äô salary due, some not having been paid since November 2015. The company had recently shut down the canteen for foreign workers. Some workers continue to rely on food donations from some community groups and embassy personnel. The workers cannot leave their accommodations because their residence permits known as ‚ÄúIqama‚Äù have expired. Only their employers can renew the expired permits. This would entail enormous costs given the immigration penalties involved per worker. If caught, they will be given prison sentences. The expiration of their ‚ÄúIqama‚Äù also complicates other matters, such as closing of bank account and inability to call home because retail outlets look for these permits before selling SIM cards or mobile-phone credits. Their lack of mobility due to lack of a valid permit also prevents these workers from going to the nearest embassy or consulate to seek help. Crime has risen inside the workers‚Äô accommodations and company premises. Company cars were overturned, housing units burned to the ground, and pickets have continued. The reason why workers cannot leave the country is because they need to have a valid exit clearance to be able to leave, which only the management can provide. Most workers have already resigned from their jobs and filed for their exit clearances. However, the company could not provide airplane tickets, end of service benefits, and most importantly salaries which have resulted in their dire situation as stranded workers.

Biography=Early life Ma√Ødou was born on 14 February 1936 in Bangui. His father, Maurice Ma√Ødou, was an official and his twin brother, Christophe Ma√Ødou, who served as the Central African Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Yugoslavia, Japan, Taiwan, France, and the United States. Henri Ma√Ødou came from an academic background and worked as a geography professor. Political career His entry into politics came on 25 June 1970, when President Jean-B√©del Bokassa named him Minister of Educuation. He became Minister of Youth, Sports, and Arts (along with Education) on 26 April 1971. Ma√Ødou was appointed Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs on 16 October 1973. On 15 June 1974, he became Minister of Urbanism and Territorial Administration. His second stint as Minister of Educuation, Youth, Sports, Arts, and Culture began on 4 April 1976. Ma√Ødou became Second Vice Prime Minister of the Central African Revolution Council on 4 September, with his portfolio consisting of national education and education reform. The council was disbanded on 14 December. Soon afterward, Bokassa transformed the country into the Central African Empire, with himself as Emperor Bokassa I. Bokassa was unsatisfied with the results of the 1977 baccalaureate and sought to reform the school system. Ma√Ødou's solution was to remove French teachers, an option Bokassa rejected. At the bidding of Bokassa, Ma√Ødou announced on 2 February 1978 that all schoolchildren must wear a specific type of uniform by 1 October. Jewelry and hats were forbidden, and students faced suspension from school if they refused to comply. The uniforms were costly, and were manufactured by a company owned by Bokassa's family, the Compagnie industrielle ouanguienne des textiles. This sparked student protests, and their suppression resulted in the \\"Bangui children's massacre\\". Around 100 children perished in the massacre. Prime Minister Ange-F√©lix Patass√© suffered a heart attack in March 1978 and went to France to recuperate. In his absence, Bokassa dissolved his government and appointed Ma√Ødou prime minister on 14 July 1978. Ma√Ødou broke with Bokassa in May 1979, after having to read a statement that denied that the children's massacre ever happened. He feared the wrath of the citizens if Bokassa's regime fell. He was likely involved in the plot that overthrew Bokassa on 20 September 1979. On 26 September, President David Dacko appointed him vice president. While vice president, Ma√Ødou gave an interview with Jeune Afrique, stating that he and Dacko were not faithful members of the regime but followed along out of terror. \\"Some terror,\\" Bokassa responded from exile, \\"with loads of CFA francs, beautiful cars, beautiful villas, beautiful women, and beautiful business. Look at him [Ma√Ødou] in the photograph, with the face of a bon vivant and playboy.\\" Ma√Ødou was removed from this position on 22 August 1980 and subsequently placed under house arrest, as many opposition groups opposed his appointment. Ma√Ødou founded the Parti republicain pour le progres on 27 December and contested the March 1981 presidential election. He finished fourth with 3.2 percent of the vote and subsequently left politics. Later career Ma√Ødou testified at Bokassa's trial in December 1986, stating he wanted to stage a coup even earlier but was unable due to the extensive espionage network. On 1 March 1988, Ma√Ødou became president of the Union bancaire en Afrique centrale (UBAC). President Patass√© named him deputy coordinator of the Dialogue national in November 2002. The Dialogue national was a national reconciliation conference, convened to reduce tensions in the country. He became an adviser to General Francois Bozize in July 2003, several months after Bozize seized power. In September, he resigned as head of the Dialogue national. Ma√Ødou was the president of the first summit of the media conference Etats generaux des media centrafricains, held between 27 August and 1 September 2007. Between December 2008 and February 2009, he was second deputy chairman of the Dialogue political inclusif, at which point he became chairman of its monitoring committee.

As an adult he moved to England, and became a British subject. His most famous work was Constitution de l'Angleterre (The Constitution of England, 1771), which was subsequently published in English as well. In it, de Lolme advocated a constitutional form of government enshrining the principle that monarchy, aristocracy and democracy should be balanced against each other. He also praised the element of representative democracy in the constitution, and urged an extension of suffrage. The work influenced many of the framers of the United States Constitution. Early life De Lolme was born in the then independent Republic of Geneva in 1740. He studied for the bar, and had begun to practise law when he was obliged to emigrate on account of a pamphlet he wrote entitled Examen de trois parts de droit (Examination of Three Parts of Rights), which gave offence to the authorities of the town. He took refuge in England, where he lived for several years on the meagre and precarious income derived from occasional contributions to various journals. Writing career The title page of a 1789 edition of de Lolme's Constitution de l'Angleterre (The Constitution of England). During his protracted exile in England, De Lolme made a careful study of the English constitution, the results of which he published in his Constitution de l'Angleterre (The Constitution of England, Amsterdam, 1771),. of which an enlarged and improved edition in English appeared in 1775,. and was several times reprinted. The work excited much interest as containing many acute observations on the causes of the excellence of the English constitution as compared with those of other countries. However, it was termed by the 11th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1911) as \\"wanting in breadth of view, being written before the period when constitutional questions were treated in a scientific manner\\". In the book, de Lolme advocated a constitutional form of government enshrining the principle of balanced government, balancing the one, the few, and the many, or the ideas of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He criticised the power of the British parliament and coined an expression which became proverbial: \\"parliament can do everything but make a woman a man and a man a woman\\". Nonetheless, de Lolme extolled the British government because, in his view, which was influenced by his own observations and study as well as by the previous writings of Voltaire and Montesquieu, the unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom embodied the ideal of balanced government better than any other government of the time. In particular, he praised the element of representative democracy in the constitution, and urged an extension of suffrage. De Lolme developed and refined his political thinking to a large extent in opposition to the more radical theory of direct democracy advocated by his compatriot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whom he accused of being unrealistic. De Lolme is sometimes identified as a probable candidate for being the person behind the pseudonymous political commentator Junius. De Lolme also wrote in English A Parallel between the English Government and the Former Government of Sweden (1772);. The History of the Flagellants (c. 1776),. based upon a work by Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux;. An Essay, Containing a Few Strictures on the Union of Scotland with England (1787);. and one or two smaller works. Later life In 1775, de Lolme found himself compelled to accept aid from a charitable society to enable him to return home. He died at Seewen, a village in the Canton of Schwyz, on 16 July 1806. Legacy De Lolme's Constitution de l'Angleterre, along with a translation of David Hume's History of England (1754‚Äì1761), supplied philosophers of the time with most of their ideas about the English constitution. It was therefore used somewhat as a political pamphlet. The work influenced many of the framers of the United States Constitution. One Founding Father who was not present in Philadelphia, but whose Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States (1787). influenced the delegates there, was John Adams, who praised De Lolme's book as one of the best on the subject of constitutionalism ever written. Some have argued that De Lolme's work also influenced the Constitution of Norway. Selected works *. Later editions: **. **. **. *. *. *.

It is one of the official residences for a serving President of Egypt. Under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt and Sudan, it was a royal palace. Ras El Tin Palace is the oldest royal Egyptian palace still in use. History The palace is located in the Ras el- Tin quarter of Alexandria overlooking the city's Western Harbour. It was built on a promontory which in antiquity had been the site of the island of Pharos. The palace has a long historical association with Egyptian royalty. It is one of few palaces in Egypt to witness the initiation of the long-lasting Muhammad Ali dynasty by Muhammad Ali Pasha (r. 1805‚Äì1848) during the early 19th century. A number of foreign architects and engineers were commissioned by Muhammad Ali for the design and construction of the palace.including Yezi Bek, his assistant La Vial, and Le Veroige. Building activities began in 1834, taking eleven years to complete the original design in 1845. Complementary work and the construction of additional wings continued for two more years until 1847, when it was officially inaugurated. Built on a rise above the harbour on the eastern seashore of Alexandria, the palace is one of a number of construction developments in the city initiated by Muhammad Ali to serve as a vice-regal palace. Initially based on the shape of a Roman fort, the palace was given a classical portico. It is said by tradition to be the site of negotiations between Muhammad Ali and Admiral Sir Charles Napier during the Oriental Crisis of 1840. The palace was used as a royal summer residence by the Muhammad Ali dynasty and as a government headquarters. During the Anglo- Egyptian War of 1882, a British naval landing party led by Captain Jacky Fisher was quartered in the palace. Fisher described it as \\"very magnificent, but a mass of fleas and dirt\\". A seaplane base was established next to the palace during the period of British rule in Egypt as part of the British naval base at Alexandria. Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 the penultimate monarch of Egypt and Sudan, King Farouk, sought refuge in the palace where he was besieged by Egyptian army forces. Farouk signed his abdication in the palace and departed from it to leave Egypt and go into exile. The palace was subsequently nationalized, as were the other former royal palaces in the country. It was used as a presidential residence and for hosting state guests. Style Ras El Tin Palace has the shape of a large Italian Renaissance palace, with architectural elements and ornamentation inspired by that era, along with Baroque and Moorish elements. It was erected on a foundation of , surrounded by elaborate gardens of 12 feddans (13 acres). Fig trees (Arabic ‚Äì teen) were already on the palace site, inspiring its name Ras Al-Teen. Through the reign of successive kings the complex was used as their residence and the government headquarters during the summer season. Various rulers made changes to the palace. It was totally reconstructed by King Fuad I in the 1920s, with modern services and redecoration making it similar to the opulent Abdeen Palace (built 1863), the larger royal complex in central Cairo. The interior d√©cor combined Renaissance elements with Byzantine, French and Modern. The redesign and construction was overseen by the Italian engineer Ernesto Verrucci Bey.cost = L.E$400,000 The palace included a swimming pool with a large attached glass pavilion hall. Much of the opulent furniture during this redecoration was supplied by the Parisian √©b√©niste, Fran√ßois Linke, on a scale not seen since Versailles 200 years earlier.Christopher Payne, Fran√ßois Linke 1855‚Äì1946, The Belle √âpoque of French Furniture, Antique Collector's Club 2003, p.269 At one end of the building was the harem, but this had become disused. After the Second World War, King Farouk had a marine pool built on the Mediterranean breakwater. The pool was linked to Ras Al-Teen with a narrow and long paved lane atop the breakwater, with a jeep used to pass through waves breaking over it. The adjacent pool house included a sitting room, bed chamber, fully equipped small kitchen, and rooms for staff and storing recreation and fishing gear. Current usage The formal garden is open to the public, but not the palace itself. A naval base is located next to the palace. The palace has been used for hosting state guests and events in recent years. There is no public museum, unlike the Montaza Palace royal gardens and museum, also in Alexandria.

Life Vazirov was born in Shusha (then Elisabethpol Governorate, Russian Empire, present-day Azerbaijan) where he also received his primary education. He was sent to school when he was 12. He learned how to read and write within three months. A year later he was sent to college where he was assigned to a professor to teach him Russian alphabet. His new professor was an Armenian named \\"Mkirtich\\" who used to beat him unfairly. He ended up running from school because he was unable to tolerate to all the tortures. A man from \\"Khish\\" (Azerbaijani city) took him and tried to take a license indicating that Vazirov knew Russian so that he could be able to write formal letters. In 1868, despite his mother did not wanted him to leave, he came to Baku. His mother wanted him to remain in his previous position because life could have been more comfortable for him. His mom used to work and earned money. Upon coming to Baku, he was accepted to school because he was smart. He stayed in Baku for a year and lived with his relatives. A year later, he was given a scholarship and was provided with a place to live. He graduated from a gymnasium (secondary school) in Baku with a silver medal. In 1873, when he was in the sixth grade, for the first time he went to a Russian theater. He admired the play. The next day he asked his gymnasium professor called \\"Hasanbay Malikov\\" whether were there any Azerbaijani theater plays. Malikov found a play called \\"Haci Qara\\" by the author \\"Mirza Fatali Akhundov\\". He decided to the comedy play in his school together with other Azerbaijani students. Everyday after dinner, they rehearsed the play. His professor \\"Hasanbay Malikov\\" used to help during the rehearsals. There were lot of people in the day of play as well as the mayor of Baku \\"Staroselski\\" where everybody enjoyed the play. After the play the secretary of the mayor \\"Hasanbay Habibbayov\\" made a banquet for the students. That night his professor \\" Hasanbay Malikov\\" sent a congratulatory letter to \\"Mirza Fatali Akhundov\\" who was the author of the original play. \\"Mirza Fatali Akhundov\\" replied with a two page long letter stating that he was very content. The last two years when he was studying in the gymnasium he started to give lessons. Gymnasium gave him a room where he taught lessons until the noon where later on he was studying. Even though he became weaker because of studying too much, he was still working hard. When he finished the gymnasium he had 600 manats. Vazirov got admitted to the Petrovsko-Razumovskaya Academy of Agriculture and Forestry in Saint Petersburg. When his money finished, he asked for financial help where nobody helped him financially nor replied back to his letter. Because of weather conditions in Saint Petersburg he became very sick. A Russian woman started taking care of Vazirov. He was very thankful to her taking care of him like a mother. Doctors said that he should move back to Moscow. In 1874, he moved back to Moscow and was enrolled to \\"Petrovski Academy\\". By then he had only 80 manats. He paid 50 of it for the tuition. When he had no money left he used to sleep under a rug on streets. Because he was very smart, he took a test where he was given a full scholarship. His professor \\"Hasanbay Malikov\\" started to write articles in the newspaper called \\"Akinchi\\" and Vazirov also started to write articles for that newspaper. He became friends with a very famous Russian journalist and writer \\"Vladimir Korolenko\\". After finishing his post-secondary studies in the 1870s, Vazirov obtained the position of a forest warden in Dilijan (present-day Armenia) but was soon laid off due to the mistrust of the authorities towards the Petrovsko-Razumovskaya Academy alumni many of whom were known for their revolutionary views. He said that he was proud to be a graduate of Petrovski and he was oppressed unfairly. The nation loved him and he was popular among the people. When he was laid off he started to engage in national literature. He wrote as much as he could. In his book he wrote : \\" If I don't die and stay alive, I will continue to write and I appreciate the ones who tracked me became the reason why\\" He then settled in Baku and passed a law course which enabled him to serve as a lawyer at the city court. He also started publishing articles and essays for the newly founded Azeri newspaper Akinchi. Najaf bey Vazirov . Axtar.az By that time Vazirov had already written several dramatic pieces, mostly comedies reflecting the everyday life of contemporary students and families. Starting from the 1890s Vazirov's liberal views on politics start influencing his works. Vazirov continues the tradition initiated by Mirza Fatali Akhundov characterised by bringing in realist ideas into the Azerbaijani literature. In his first tragedy entitled Musibat-i Fakhraddin (\\"Fakhraddin's Grief\\", 1896) touches upon the theme of fanaticism suppressing young educated minds who struggle against reactionism and ignorance. This work is considered the first example of the realistic tragedy genre in the Azerbaijani literature. In his subsequent works such as Pahlivan-i Zamana (\\"Heroes of Our Time\\", 1900) he criticised the corrupt nature of the government institutions and remnants of the patriarchal social system. Azerbaijani Literature by Garayev et al. His last work, Taza asrin ibtidasi (\\"The Beginning of the New Century\\", 1924), was written after Azerbaijan became part of the Soviet Union and was dedicated to women's emancipation. He died in Baku in 1926. Vazirov's works significantly enriched the repertoire of the then young Azerbaijani theatre and decisively established realistic genre as the dominant one in the Azerbaijani drama. The Lankaran State Drama Theatre is named after Najaf bey Vazirov.

Such human-built canyons are made when streets separate dense blocks of structures, especially skyscrapers. Other examples include the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, Los Angeles' Wilshire Boulevard corridor, Toronto's Financial District, and Hong Kong's Kowloon and Central districts. Urban canyons affect various local conditions, including temperature, wind, light, air quality, and radio reception, including satellite navigation signals.  Geometry and classification  Ideally an urban canyon is a relatively narrow street with tall, continuous buildings on both sides of the road. But now the term urban canyon is used more broadly, and the geometrical details of the street canyon are used to categorize them. The most important geometrical detail about a street canyon is the ratio of the canyon height (H) to canyon width (W), H/W, which is defined as the aspect ratio. The value of the aspect ratio can be used to classify street canyons as follows: * Regular canyon ‚Äì aspect ratio ‚âà 1 and no major openings on the canyon walls * Avenue canyon ‚Äì aspect ratio < 0.5 * Deep canyon ‚Äì aspect ratio ‚âà 2 A sub-classification of each of the above can be done depending on the distance between two major intersections along the street, defined as the length (L) of the street canyon: * Short canyon ‚Äì L/H ‚âà 3 * Medium canyon ‚Äì L/H ‚âà 5 * Long canyon ‚Äì L/H ‚âà 7 Another classification is based on the symmetry of the canyon: * Symmetric (or even) canyon ‚Äì the buildings that make the canyon have approximately the same height; * Asymmetric canyon ‚Äì the buildings that make the canyon have significant height differences. Another specific type is: * the step-up canyon ‚Äì a street canyon where the height of the upwind building is less than the height of the downwind building. The effect of a street canyon on local wind and air quality can greatly differ in different canyon geometries and this will be discussed in detail in sections below. Other important factors taken into account in studies of urban canyons are the air volume, orientation of the canyon (north‚Äìsouth, east‚Äìwest etc.) and the sky view factor. The air volume of the street canyon is the air contained within the buildings on either side which act as walls, the street which is the bottom boundary, and an imaginary upper boundary at roof level called the 'lid' of the canyon. The sky view factor (SVF) denotes the ratio between radiation received by a planar surface and that from the entire hemispheric radiating environment and is calculated as the fraction of sky visible from the ground up. SVF is a dimensionless value that ranges from 0 to 1. A SVF of 1 means that the sky is completely visible, for example, in a flat terrain. When a location has buildings and trees, it will cause the SVF to decrease proportionally. Effects The modification of the characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer by the presence of a street canyon is called the street canyon effect. As mentioned earlier, street canyons affect temperature, wind speed and wind direction and consequently the air quality within the canyon. Temperature Urban canyons contribute to the urban heat island effect. The temperature inside the canyon can be elevated 2‚Äì4 ¬∞C. Studies of temperature phenomena consider irradiance, angle of incidence, surface albedo, emissivity, temperature and SVF. For a high SVF, the urban canyons cool quickly, because more sky is available to absorb the heat retained by the buildings. With a low SVF, the canyon can retain more heat during the day, creating a higher heat release at night. A study done by Nunez and Oke investigated the energy exchanges in an urban canyon in mid-latitudes in fine summer weather. The study showed that the amount of surface energy at various times within the canyon depends on canyon geometry and orientation. Canyons with north‚Äìsouth orientation were found to have the floor being the most active energy site. In such a canyon, 30% of midday radiant surplus is stored in the canyon materials (the buildings). At night, the net radiant deficit (meaning the lack of solar radiation) is countered by the release of energy that was being stored in the canyon materials. This phenomenon contributes heavily to the urban heat island effect. Wind Street canyons can modify both the speed and the direction of winds. The vertical wind velocity approaches zero at the roof level of the canyon. Shear production and dissipation are high at the roof level and a strong thin shear layer is created at the building height. Turbulence kinetic energy is higher near the downwind building than near the upwind building because of stronger wind shears. The resulting flow patterns inside the canyon depend on the wind direction with respect to the street orientation direction. =Wind parallel to canyon= When the roof level/background wind direction is parallel to the street, a channelization effect is seen where winds tend to be channeled and accelerated through the canyon. Where the street width is non-uniform, a Venturi effect is seen when winds funnel through small openings, further enhancing the acceleration of winds. Both these effects are explained by the Bernoulli's principle. The along-street wind and transport can be significantly different for short and long canyons as the corner vortices have a stronger influence in short canyons. =Wind perpendicular to canyon= When the roof level/background wind direction is perpendicular to the street, a vertically rotating wind flow is created with a centered primary vortex inside street canyons. Based on the aspect ratio, different flow regimes are defined in street canyons. In the increasing order of aspect ratio these flow regimes are: isolated roughness flow, wake interference flow and skimming flow. The total number of vortices made and their intensities depends on many factors. Numerical model studies done for isolated street canyons have shown that the number of vortexes made increases with increasing aspect ratio of the canyon. But there is a critical value of the ambient wind speed, above which the number and pattern of vortexes become independent of the aspect ratio. The comparison of (a) isolated roughness flow and (b) skimming flow regimes in a street canyon (after Oke, 1988) Numerical and wind tunnel studies have shown that for symmetric canyons with an aspect ratio = 0.5, a ground level secondary vortex can be seen near the leeward side building wall. For symmetric canyons with aspect ratio ‚â• 1.4, a weaker ground level secondary vortex can be seen near the windward side building wall and for aspect ratio ‚â• 2 secondary vortexes are seen right below the primary vortex. In asymmetric and step-up canyons the formation of secondary vortexes can be more common. Wind tunnel studies have shown that, in a step-up canyon where the upwind building is shorter, a stagnation point can be identified on the windward face of the taller building. The region below this stagnation point is called the interaction region, since all streamlines in this region are deflected downward into the street canyon. The characteristics of the vortex flow patterns inside the canyon strongly depend the height ratio of buildings on either side of the canyon. For a downwind building height Hd to upwind building height Hu ratio of 3, a single primary vortex has been observed. But for Hd/Hu=1.67, counter-rotating vortexes can occupy the whole depth of the canyon. Other factors that have an effect on the strength of this re- circulation flow are traffic induced turbulence and roof shapes of the buildings. Physical model studies have shown that two way traffics increases the turbulence in the lower half of the canyon and that pitched roof on either side of the canyon shifts the main area of turbulent production downstream and reduced the intensity of the re-circulation flow inside the canyon. In the skimming flow regime, the wind vortex made inside a street canyon, when mean wind direction is perpendicular to the street (after Oke, 1988) Under these perpendicular wind conditions, mainly at the street level, at each end of the canyon, horizontally rotating corner/end vortexes are made. The horizontal extent of these corner vortexes are different at each end of a canyon and this leads complex surface level wind patterns at intersections. Field experiments have further shown that corner vortexes can extend in the whole depth of canyon but with changing horizontal extent with height. The structure of the neighboring area of a street canyon; for instance a series of street canyons, add more complexity to flow field. All the above-mentioned results are for situations with no heating effects. A numerical model study have shown that, when a surface in a street canyons heats up, it changes the characteristics of the vortex flow. And heating of different surfaces; upwind wall, downwind wall, canyon floor, changes the vortex flow in different manners. Air quality The modification of temperature and wind by the presence of a street canyon, consequently affect the air quality inside the street canyon. When the direction of the mean wind is parallel to the street, the channelization and Venturi effects described above, increases the dispersion of pollutants inside the street canyon. This often act to 'flush out' the air pollutants and increase the air quality inside the street canyon. But in instances where air pollutant sources are present upwind, channeling winds could transport pollutants to downwind locations far from the source and contribute to bad quality at the downwind locations. When the mean wind direction is perpendicular to the street, the vortex flow formed inside the canyon acts to confine air flow, reduce dispersion of pollutants and increase the pollution concentrations inside the street canyon. Pollution from local source inside the canyon and also pollution entrained in to the canyon from the mean wind flow, is carried by the vortex flow and is re-circulated within the canyon. In urban environments, vehicle tail pipe emissions are the major source of many air pollutants such as ultrafine particles, fine particles, carbon dioxide, NOx. These pollution plumes created on the street, at the surface level, are pushed toward the lee side of the canyon by the vortex flow, making the surface level pollution concentrations much higher at the leewardside of the street compared to the windward side. Secondary vortexes in the lower portion of the canyon can further act to stagnate pollutants on the side walks; specially on the leeward side. One field study has reported ultrafine particle concentrations four times higher on the leeward side sidewalk compared to the windward side. GPS signal reception When using GPS receivers in street canyons with tall buildings, the shadowing and multipath effects may contribute to poor GPS signal reception.

Adaptations An abridged audiobook version, read by the author, was released on LP and cassette. A film adaptation, written and directed by Terence Ryan, was released in 2002. It stars Sean Hughes as the renamed \\"Dan Madigan\\" and Richard Attenborough (in his final film role) as the narrator (after Spike Milligan's poor health prevented him from taking the part), along with British, Irish and American character actors including Elliott Gould, Griff Rhys Jones, Milo O'Shea, David Kelly, Marc Sinden, Daragh O'Malley, Nickolas Grace and Freddie Jones. Jane Milligan (Spike's daughter) appeared in the small role of Mrs. Madigan. The film was cast by Jo Gilbert and shot in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Puckoon was adapted for the stage in 2009, and toured Ireland and the United Kingdom. An adaptation by Ian Billings, narrated by Barry Cryer and starring Ed Byrne as Dan Milligan and Pauline McLynn was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2019.

Population details taken at the 2011 census can be found under Himley. It is situated on the A463 road, between Sedgley and Wombourne. It was historically part of the ancient manor of Sedgley, becoming part of the Sedgley urban district in 1894, remaining part of this authority until 1966, when it became part of the Seisdon Rural District in 1966, despite the bulk of Sedgley being absorbed into Dudley County Borough. This in turn was replaced by the South Staffordshire District in 1974. However, it still has a Sedgley DY3 postcode. The main entrance to the Baggeridge Country Park, opened in the early 1980s on the site of the former Baggeridge Colliery, is situated to the west of the village. Also in the village was the original works (and former headquarters) of Baggeridge Brick, finally part of Wienerberger AG, which by 2012 had closed down as the factory's owners agreed a deal with David Wilson Homes to build a new housing estate on the site. The factory buildings were demolished but the iconic brick chimney was retained, being a local landmark and one of the last of its kind to remain locally. Construction of the new estate began in 2014 and the first houses were occupied by the spring of 2015, with the estate being almost complete by 2018. The focal point of the village is the Summer House, a public house in the east of the village, which was built in the early 19th century. The building has since been expanded.. Until 1986, the village had a regular hourly bus service 564 between Sedgley and Wolverhampton via Penn Common. However this service was deemed not commercially viable and was operated by a succession of operators under contract to Staffordshire County Council to a gradually reduced frequency. The last regular service, operated by Arriva Midlands, was withdrawn due to lack of use. On 1st August 2020, The Green Bus reintroduced a bus service through the village on Saturdays only between Wolverhampton and Kidderminster via Wombourne and Penn on a commercial basis. This route is due for withdrawal on 30th August 2020.

Main Building, University of Texas, Austin, Texas (postcard, circa 1905) The Main Building in 2019 The crowded stacks at the Life Science Library. The old Victorian-Gothic Main Building served as the central point of the campus's forty-acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes beginning in 1882. However, by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. All that remains of the Old Main Building are its old chime bells (called the Burleson BellsThe Carillon The University of Texas. Accessed March 29, 2006.), which are now exhibited as part of a permanent display outside the university's Bass Concert Hall. The modern-day Main Building and Tower were constructed in its place.  1935-present  The present Main Building designed by Paul Philippe Cret. Ye shall know the Truth and the Truth shall make you free\\". Originally, the university planned to use the Tower as a library space, using a dumbwaiter system to carry books from the upper floors to the students requesting them in the circulation room on a lower floor. Library employees were stationed on every other floor; students filled out paper book-request slips, which were sent upstairs by a pneumatic tube. The books were sent down to the students using an 18-story dumbwaiter. This proved ineffective, and the dumbwaiter is no longer used for that purpose. The building now mainly contains administrative offices, though it does still house a three-floor life sciences library and the Miriam Lutcher Stark Library of early and significant editions of English Romanticist works. Two separate sets of elevators serve the building; one in the front, one in back. In the floors above the stacks and below a few top-floor offices, several floors contain the university herbarium (Plant Resources Center). U.S. Census data are compiled and analyzed on some of these floors. Lastly, two secure elevators provide access to all 27 floors of the Tower while an elevator on the 27th floor provides access to the 28th-floor Observation Deck. There is also a book elevator in the stacks that serves floors 2 through 17. The 307-foot (94 m) tower was designed by Paul Philippe Cret. Completed in 1937, the Main Building is located in the middle of campus. At the top of the Tower is a carillon of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. The carillon is played daily. During World War II, an air raid siren built by the chief communications engineer for the University, Jack Maguire, was placed on top of the Tower to notify Austin residents of incoming air attacks. As there was never an air attack on the city, this siren was only tested and never truly used. The decommissioned siren was superseded by four electronic warning sirens that were installed in early 2007. = 1966 massacre = On August 1, 1966, Charles Joseph Whitman, an architectural engineering student at the university, barricaded himself in the observation deck of the tower of the Main Building with a scoped Remington 700 deer rifle and various other weapons.

The number 12 in lights refers to the graduating class of 2012. The Tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening, but is lit in various color schemes for special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments. To mark more somber events, such as the passing of a former president of the university, the Tower remains darkened with a soft grey glow through the night. Carl J. Eckhardt Jr., head of the Physical Plant in 1931, supervised the construction of the Main Building Tower. Eckhardt devised a lighting system to take advantage of its commanding architecture to announce university achievements. Beginning in 1937, orange lights were used to symbolize important events at the university; by 1947, standard guidelines for using the orange lights were created, and these have been updated since. Today there are many different options for lighting, including a darkened tower to signify solemn occasions.

It is also known as Slovak Bomber, Freelove or Explosion-II. It infects the master boot record (MBR) of the hard disk, and any files with extensions .COM, .SCR and .EXE. However, it will not infect files that have SCAN, CLEAN, FINDVIRU, GUARD, NOD, VSAFE, MSAV or CHKDSK in the name. It is also known as one of the first viruses to implement a technique of \\"patchy infection\\", introduced in Bomber. OneHalf has about 20 different variants, all with functionally similar behaviour.  Payload  OneHalf is known for its peculiar payload: at every boot, it encrypts two unencrypted cylinders of the user's Hard disk, but then temporarily decrypts them when they are accessed. This makes sure the user does not notice that their hard disk is being encrypted like this, and lets the encryption continue further. It also hides the real MBR from programs on the computer, to make detection harder. The encryption is done by bitwise XORing by a randomly generated key, which can be decrypted simply by XORing with the same bit stream again. Once the virus has encrypted half of the disk, and/or on the 4th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, 20th, 24th, 28th and 30th of any month and under some other conditions, the virus will display the message: > Dis is one half. > > Press any key to continue ...  Removal  OneHalf's unique payload makes removal harder: simply removing the virus and cleaning the MBR will leave the data encrypted, requiring backups to restore it. As such, special tools are needed to decrypt the hard disk before removing the virus. One such tool was developed for SAC (Slovak Antivirus Center) to do this job.

The magazine is based in Valencia, California, and is one of the oldest titles dedicated to martial arts in the United States. History and profile The magazine was founded in 1961 by Mitoshi Uyehara. It was published by Uyehara under the company \\"Black Belt, Inc.\\" based in Los Angeles until 1973. Although the publication went mainstream in 1961, the first magazine was produced and sold for ten cents and was put together on the kitchen floor of Uyehara's home in 1958. By the first year of producing a full publication in 1961, Uyehara was in debt for $30,000. This story has been one that he has shared with his children and grandchild to believe in oneself and fight against the odds. Bruce Lee contributed many articles to the publication during the 1960s. Uyehara, a martial artist in his own right, was a key personage in arranging Lee's material for publication. Uyehara is a 3rd Dan in Aikido but studied many other arts. He is the student of Tohei Sensei, an Aikido master. Uyehara believed that Americans could benefit from the discipline of martial arts, and his love for the art is what led to turning a hobby into a living. What began as a humble endeavor of opening the first Aikido dojo in Los Angeles, grew into a magazine, and sports exhibition. His relationship with Bruce Lee was mutual. While Uyehara immediately saw Lee's talent and featured him in his publications, Lee reciprocated by his loyalty in only providing direct interviews to Uyehara once he reached stardom. The two men knew they were both minorities in an art that was not embraced by Americans at the time. The two remained close friends until Lee's death. Uyehara has never had another best friend since the death of Lee. Uyehara, in his own humble way, and because he recognized the value of Lee's talent, continued to perpetuate Lee's art through his own children and grandson, currently a cadet at the United States Military Academy, West Point, N.Y. Uyehara founded \\"Rainbow Publications\\" in 1974 (based in Los Angeles, later Burbank, CA and Santa Clarita, CA), where he acted as president, but he ceased acting as an editor from this time. Uyehara moved to Honolulu in 1980, from where he continued to act as a publisher until 1998. Uyehara was originally from Lahaina, Maui, and saw the value of returning home to be close to his family. During this transitional period, the magazine underwent a frequent change in editorship (Bob MacLaughlin 1974, Rick Shively 1976, Richard Zimmerman 1978, John R. Corbett 1980, John Steward 1980, John Hanson 1981, James Nail 1982-83) until Jim Coleman became executive editor in 1984, serving until 1997. Robert W. Young succeeded Coleman in 1997/8, shortly before the acquisition of the magazine by Sabot Publishing, and remains executive editor as of 2016.

Both full- time residents of the Coachella Valley as well as seasonal visitors from the northern part of the United States and Canada made KWXY one of the most successful stations in the area both in demographics as well as revenue. In addition, the on-air lineup boasted Dave Hull, named one of the top ten greatest broadcasters in Los Angeles radio history, and his KFI colleague Scott Ellsworth. KWXY also broadcast news reports from Canada for Canadian citizens who visit the Coachella Valley during the winter season. In January 2010, it was announced that KWXY-FM would cease broadcasting on 98.5 FM and broadcast only on the 1340 AM frequency. Dave Hull signed off the FM station at 11:59 pm February 1. KDES, another R&R; Broadcasting station originally broadcasting at 104.7, has taken over the 98.5 frequency allocation and will continue with its classic hits programming. Licensing of the 104.7 frequency then moved from Palm Springs to Riverside. In June 2014 the station began simulcasting on KDES-HD2 and on a leased FM translator at 107.3 and changed its branding to \\"Legend 107.3: The Sound of the Desert\\". The branding was later amended to \\"107.3 MOD-FM\\". In November 2015 KWXY changed to a syndicated liberal talk format while the programming rights to its previous standards format and the 107.3 translator (due to a sale to Alpha Media) moved to KDES- HD2 as Mod 107.3 FM but continues to play classic songs from The Great American Songbook as well as easy listening favorites, but no instrumentals. On August 12, 2016, KWXY and sister station KPSI (now KKGX) went silent. In October 2016, Desert Broadcasters agreed to acquire both stations from R&R; Radio Corporation. On March 14, 2017, KWXY returned to the air as \\"Relaxing Music 1340\\" and once again airs an Adult Standards music format. The sale to Desert Broadcasters was consummated on March 31, 2017. A simulcast on FM translator K222DA (92.3 FM) was added on April 23, 2018. on August 4, 2020 KWXY's Website is hinting a change is happening on the station its unknown if the format is gonna be changed and the station is running liners saying \\"Change is coming to KWXY and we think your gonna like it\\" On August 13th KWXY announced that there FM translator K222DA 92.3 was getting the power boosted from 60 watts to 99 watts.

The locomotives are equipped with a Caterpillar 3516 DI-TA prime mover, which provides a power output of and a starting tractive effort of . Twenty locomotives were delivered in 1996, largely based on MaK's previous production series, the Dutch NS Class 6400 and German DE 1002, although receiving some upgrades to the specifications. NSB took delivery of the class to replace the aging Di 3, and the units have been used on freight trains on un-electrified lines, including the Nordland Line and the R√∏ros Line. They were transferred to CargoNet in 2002, when NSB's cargo division was demerged. Ten units were sold to GB Railfreight in 2011 and are used at the Scunthorpe Steel works in Scunthorpe, United Kingdom. History During the late 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new locomotive type to replace its aging fleet of Di 3 diesel-electric locomotives, which made up the back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as freight and passenger trains on the Nordland Line, and to a lesser extent on the R√∏ros Line.N√¶ss: 138 In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five Di 4 from Henschel.N√¶ss: 72 Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued,N√¶ss: 100 as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives. Twin Di 8 unit hauling a CargoNet freight train across Saltfjellet on the Nordland Line A MaK-built DB Class 240 locomotive was test- run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board decided to order ten similar units, later expanded to twelve, which would primarily be used in passenger trains. During the procurement process, NSB started to pursue the smaller locomotives for freight trains, and turned to MaK to investigate their smaller locomotives. NSB's need for hauling power was dire enough that the company leased two locomotives of two classes of diesel-electric locomotives, the SJ T44 from the Swedish State Railways and the MaK-built NS 6400 from Nederlandse Spoorwegen. The NS 6400 was built through a cooperation between MaK and Brown, Boveri & Cie in Mannheim, with 120 units having been built between 1988 and 1992. It was again based on the DE 1002, which had been built in twenty-four copies for the H√§fen und G√ºterverkehr K√∂ln 1982 and 1993. Another variant of the DE 1002 and NS 6400 is the Eurotunnel Class 0001, built in 1991. The Di 8 was technically similar, although slightly larger and more powerful, than the Dutch and German variants. Delivery of both the Di 6 and 8 commenced in 1996. The first Di 8 was delivered on 8 June 1996 and the last on 10 June 1997. NSB hoped that the combined 32 locos would be sufficient to replace all the Di 3s. However, the Di 8s were at first put into use on freight trains in Eastern Norway, largely running on electrified lines and thus not replacing the Di 3. Unlike their larger counterparts, which were unsuitable for service and returned to the manufacturer, the Di 8 proved a sufficiently reliable to remain in operation. The Di 8s were gradually introduced on the Nordland Line and Mer√•ker Line to replace the Di 3 on freight trains. The Di 8 operated in pairs, which proved to be an optimal power ratio and driving times on the Nordland Line. On the other hand, the locomotives had high operating costs, in part because of the twin configuration, and proved less reliable than NSB had hoped. No. 714 was plagued with operational problems because of errors in a generator. Delivered in January 1997, it was retired in late 2000 and started being used for parts from 2002. This makes it the among the shortest-serving locomotives in NSB's service. NSB's initial motivation for the smaller units was to haul conventional local freight trains and affiliated heavy-duty shunting. With the reorganization of the railways during the late 1990s and early 2000s, this job fell out of use, making the locomotives poorly suited for NSB's network. The locomotives passed to CargoNet in 2002, after the split of Norwegian State Railways (NSB) into passenger and freight companies. From the mid-2000s CargoNet started looking for a replacement for the Di 8 in the freight trains, especially for on the Nordland Line. The company decided to lease six EMD Class 66 units, which entered service in Norway in 2005. The Di 8 remained in service, but in other trains. Two CargoNet units, in new and original livery, hauling a lumber train near Hjerkinn on the Dovre Line On 4 April 2011, a fire broke out on a Di 8 locomotive at Kl√∏fta on the Trunk Line while hauling a 16-wagon train of jet fuel to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The fire started in an electrical cabinet after a diesel pipe running over it had cracked. The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as he thought it was an electric train. The damages were so severe that the locomotive was scrapped. The Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized CargoNet for not having sufficient maintenance routines for diesel pipes, as they were neither part of the maintenance procedure nor where there specified intervals for replacement. With the delivery of the Class 66 and later the Vossloh Euro, CargoNet's need for the uneconomical and underdimensioned Di 8 fell through. The Euro was put into service on the Nordland Line and the Rauma Line, and NSB started looking for a possibility to sell the locomotives. In October 2011, GB Railfreight was awarded the contract for the operation of the railway after Sahaviriya Steel Industries had bought and reopened Teesside Steelworks in Redcar, United Kingdom. They were thus in need for locomotives to haul the internal torpedo trains with liquid steel between the steelwork's blast furnaces and continuous casters. Ten Di 8s were thereby sold, of which the first five were shipped on 12 December 2011, and arrived on 20 December, and the last were delivered in January 2012. Eight of the ten locomotives will be used in revenue service; the other two will be used for parts. At that point, seven Di 8s remained in service with CargoNet, with one having been retired and one used for parts. No. 714 was, as the first Di 8, scrapped on 10 July 2013. On closure of Teesside Steelworks in 2015, the locos were leased to Tata Steel (now British Steel) for use at their Scunthorpe works to replace the ageing Janus fleet Fleet List NSB Number ‚Üí Status 8.701 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.702 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.703 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.704 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.705 ‚Üí In Service NSB Berging og Beredskap AS 8.706 ‚Üí In Service NSB Berging og Beredskap AS 8.707 ‚Üí In Service NSB Berging og Beredskap AS 8.708 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.709 ‚Üí In Service NSB AS 8.710 ‚Üí In Service NSB AS 8.711 ‚Üí Out of Service, for parts in Redcar (GB) 8.712 ‚Üí Out of Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.713 ‚Üí In Service NSB Berging og Beredskap AS 8.714 ‚Üí Scrapped Norway (Reliability Issues) 8.715 ‚Üí In Service NSB Berging og Beredskap AS 8.716 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.717 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.718 ‚Üí Out of Service, for parts British Steel Scunthorpe 8.719 ‚Üí In Service British Steel Scunthorpe 8.720 ‚Üí Out of Service British Steel Scunthorpe Source:https://www.flickr.com/photos/boulbymine/sets/72157629162140659/ Source:https://www.loks-aus-kiel.de/ Specifications Di 8.708 hauling a timber train at H√∏nefoss Station The Di 8 is a diesel-electric locomotive with a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. They have a weight of and are built for standard gauge. The locomotives are long, wide and tall. The wheelbase on the bogies is , while the wheelbase between the bogies is . The wheels have a diameter of when new. Each locomotive is equipped with a Caterpillar 3516 DI-TA prime mover and a fuel capacity of . This provides a power output of at 1,800 revolutions per minute, allowing for a maximum operating speed of . They have a starting tractive effort of 270 kilenewtons. The locomotives employ a Siemens Sibas 32 control system, along with an electrical transmission system from the same manufacturer. It takes advantage of water-cooled gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) semiconductor technology for pulse-width modulation inverters to supply power to the alternating current traction motors, located on a nose- suspended drive. The auxiliary electrical equipment was powered by an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter. NSB's Di 3, Di 4, Di 6 and Di 8 can all be run with together with up to three locomotives in multiple. The class is characterized by motormen as a comfortable locomotive with a good working environment. Due to their loading gauge, the Di 8s cannot be used on the British mainline railways, and are limited to being used on the internal steelworks railways. In comparison to the NS 6400 and DE 1002, the Di 8s are (NS) and longer. The electrical transmission system saw ABB systems replaced by Siemens and the installation of GTO and IGBT systems. The power output was significantly improved, from between . Caterpillar replace the other systems MTU and MWM motors. The increased power came at only a two-tonne weight penalty over the NS 6400.

Located on \\"Milchgasse\\" (\\"Milk Street\\"), it was the official residence for the Scharfrichter (executioner) of the city of Passau. It is now a jazz and cabaret stage on which political cabaret is performed.  History  Early historical documents, from the 13th century until 1443, mention the building as the feared \\"Prislig\\" prison. Around 1620, during the 30 years war, then- executioner Kaspar would distribute small slips of paper that would make the owner invulnerable. This went into the history books as \\"Passauerkunst\\" or Art of Passau. In the 1970s, the city of Passau was under the very strong influence of the conservatives of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Passau, and the Passauer press (Passauer Neue Presse, PNP). Consequently, a counter cultural movement developed and a political cabaret was formed in Passau. The main cabaret performers in this movement were Bruno Jonas and Siegfried Zimmerschied. In opposition to this counter culture movement, the chief editor of the PNP established a news embargo on the cabaret organization. The \\"Generalvikar\\" (high Catholic Church functionary) of the diocese took the movement to the court charging blasphemy. As a result, the city of Passau imposed a ban on the cabaret‚Äôs performances. The Scharfrichterhaus of today was founded in March 1977 by Walter Landshuter and Edgar Liegl. It has developed quickly to be an important jazz and cabaret stage on which political cabaret is performed. In 1979, the Passauer Cabaret Days was celebrated for the first time. This is a festival for art, theatre, music and cabaret. Since 1983 the Scharfrichterhaus, in collaboration with the Bavarian TV channel and a Munich newspaper, awarded the \\"Executioner‚Äôs Hatchet\\". German comedian Hape Kerkeling received this award in 1983. The Scharfrichterhaus, a place of cultural communication, as it names itself, is even known beyond the regional and national borders. Musicians and cabaret artists offer entertainment in a special atmosphere. Events in the Scharfrichterhaus include regular performances of jazz, readings, cabaret, chanson or theatre. Due to space restrictions, some of the events take place in the nearby \\"Redoute Passau\\".  Modern features  Today the Scharfrichterhaus has two main features for visitors. The first is a cafe that is part of the house and is modeled after a Viennese coffeehouse of the 19th and 20th century. The second feature is a restaurant with selected food and wine, and an additional wine-cellar. The patio of the Scharfrichterhaus The Scharfrichterhaus also contains the independent \\"Scharfrichter-Cinema\\". The Passauer film operator Manfred Vesper has rented its rooms since 5 February 1987, based on an initiative from Walter Landshuter for a cinema, fitting to the remaining program of the Scharfrichterhaus. Those rooms had been already used for some years to present a weekly ambitious cinema, but these events had not been widely accepted by the audience. A distinct feature of the new institution is the repertory cinema. With its detailed program the visitor knows already weeks in advance what is available. A program guide called \\"Trailer\\", the cinema's main advertising, is spread out in a circulation of 6000 copies and laid out in various shops, sent by post or email. The selection of movies, which fit into the other Scharfrichterhaus program, aims to reach viewers interested in non-mainstream movies and is primarily chosen by Vesper. In addition, there is also a program advisory board. It consists of Landshuter and Vesper, two professors of the university of Passau, and two employees who work out together the different film rows at their regular meetings and submit them to the annual competition of the Federal Minister of the Interior for support of the cinema (German: Filmf√∂rderanstalt). Up to now every year the cinema won the prize of 5000 euro. These prizes must be used for re-investments.

It is provided by Cambridge English Language Assessment through authorised Cambridge English Teaching Qualification centres and can be taken either full-time or part-time. The course was originally known as DELTA (Diploma in English Language Teaching to Adults) and is still referred to in this way by some course providers. However, in 2011 the qualification title was amended on the Ofqual register to the Cambridge English Level 7 Diploma In Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (Delta) in order to reflect that the wider range of students that teachers might have, including younger learners. Delta is designed for candidates with previous English language teaching experience. Candidates have usually completed an initial teaching qualification and typically have at least one year's teaching experience. It is suitable for first language and non-first language speakers of English who are teaching English as a second or foreign language (ESL and EFL) in primary, secondary and adult contexts. Candidates should have English language skills equivalent to at least level C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Delta consists of three modules, which can be taken together or separately, in any order, and over any time period. Module Two requires course attendance at an authorised Delta centre so that teaching practice can be supported and assessed. There is no requirement to take a course at a recognised Delta centre for Modules One and Three, although most candidates do. Successful candidates receive a certificate for each module passed, as well as an overall certificate upon the successful completion of all three modules. All three modules emphasise both theory and practice, although teaching practice is only directly assessed in Module Two. Delta also gives teachers an opportunity to pursue areas of specialism in Module Three (an extended assignment on syllabus design, course planning and assessment in the context of a selected ELT specialist area, or an extended assignment on ELT management in the context of a selected management specialist area).

Candidates wishing to enter Module Two are required to take Module Two at an authorised Delta centre. Centres have their own selection procedures for entry onto Module Two.http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/images/181161-delta-handbook-for-tutors- and-candidates-document.pdf Accessed 18 May 2015 Delta aims and main features Delta is aimed at those wanting to update their teaching knowledge and improve their practice. It is designed to help candidates to: * Extend knowledge and understanding of the principles and practice of English language teaching * Critically examine current beliefs and practices as a teacher * Apply new knowledge and understanding to a current teaching role * Extend knowledge of English language teaching in contexts other than adult learners * Develop their career and to apply for more senior roles.http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching- qualifications/delta/why-take-delta/ Accessed 18 May 20115 Delta consists of three modules, each of which is separately assessed and certified. Achievement of a Pass in all three modules confers the status of a full Delta qualification. Candidates may choose to do any or all of the modules; there is no time limit for the completion of all three modules and there is no limit on the number of times a candidate can take a module. The modular framework aims to provide an accessible professional development programme with flexible entry points. Candidates can take the modules in any order, although it is most practical to take them in order, as Modules Two and Three assume the candidate has knowledge and competencies gained in the previous module(s).http://www.englishlanguagehouse.co.uk/downloads/139463-delta- candidate-leaflet-document.pdf Accessed 18 May 2015 The three Delta Modules are: Module One ‚Äì Understanding language, methodology and resources for teaching * This module focuses on the background to teaching and learning English in a range of ELT contexts Module Two ‚Äì Developing professional practice * This module focuses on developing awareness and expertise in relation to the principles and professional practice of teaching English in a range of ELT contexts Module Three ‚Äì Option 1: Extending practice and English language teaching specialism or Option 2: English language teaching management. * This module focuses on broadening candidates‚Äô knowledge of a chosen specialism and developing understanding of syllabus design, testing and assessment (Option 1), or of ELT management (Option 2). All three modules focus on both theory and practice, though teaching practice is only directly assessed in Module Two. Candidates have the opportunity to focus on a specialist area of teaching in Modules Two and Three. Candidates may either follow a course at a centre or prepare independently for Modules One and Three. Module Two requires course attendance at an approved Delta centre so that teaching can be supported and assessed. A Module Two course will involve 200 learning hours, including 100 tutor facilitated hours and 100 independent learning hours (reading and research and assignment preparation). The course dates, fees, course format (e.g. face-to-face learning, distance learning) are determined by each centre. The exact nature of each course will vary from centre to centre,http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching- qualifications/delta/how-to-register/ Accessed 18 May 2015 but all courses will cover the same content points, as set out in the Delta syllabus developed by Cambridge English Language Assessment. Course syllabus The Delta syllabus includes three modules, which are assessed by a combination of exams, teaching practice and written coursework, and an extended essay. * Module One: written exam * Module Two: practical assessment and portfolio of coursework * Module Three: extended essay The following section outlines the main content points of each module. The full learning outcomes and indicative content are available in the course syllabus.

Module Two is set at a postgraduate level (with 20 credit value). Assessment takes place during the course through assessed teaching practice, assignments and background essays as well as via a teaching practice assignment which is externally assessed by a Cambridge English assessor. Module Three ‚Äì Extending practice and ELT specialism (option 1) or ELT management (option 2) Candidates have a choice of two options for Module Three: * Option One: Extending practice and English language teaching specialism. This focuses on needs analysis, syllabus design, course planning and assessment in the context of a selected specialism (e.g. English for academic purposes, teaching exam classes, young learners, one-to-one teaching). * Option Two: English language teaching management. This focuses on situation analysis and planning, and implementing change in the context of a selected management specialism.http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching- qualifications/delta/about-the-delta-modules/ Accessed 18 May 2015 Module Three is set at a postgraduate level (with 20 credit value).http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/images/22096-delta-syllabus.pdf Accessed 18 May 2015 It is assessed through an externally marked extended assignment of 4,000 ‚Äì 4,500 words focused on a chosen teaching specialism (Option 1) or a chosen ELT management specialism (Option 2). Option One ‚Äì Extending practice and ELT specialism Option One has six syllabus content points: # Research into specialist areas # Syllabus design: principles, influences on, methodological effects of, and major syllabus types as applied to the specific learning context # Designing syllabus and teaching programmes to meet the needs of learners in the specific context of their selected specialism # Course design and development in the specific context of their selected specialism # The principles and practice of testing and assessment and application to the candidate's specialist area # Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness and quality of courses and programmes of study. Option Two ‚Äì English language teaching management Option Two has four syllabus content points: # Research into a chosen management specialism # Methods of situation analysis # Design of change proposals # Implementation of change proposals. Candidates will need access to management data from a relevant language teaching context.http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching- qualifications/delta/about-the-delta-modules/ Accessed 18 May 2015 Assessment Assessment is conducted on a module-by-module basis. Module One ‚Äì Understanding language, methodology and resources for teaching Module One has a written examination (externally set and marked), which consists of two 90-minute written papers with a 30-minute break between each paper (3 hours 30 minutes total). Paper 1 has five tasks, requiring labelling, short answer and longer written responses. Paper 2 has three tasks, requiring longer, written responses. All tasks are compulsory. Paper 1 ‚Äì total of 100 marks available Task 1 (6 marks) has six definitions of ELT-related terms. Candidates supply the correct term for each definition. Task 2 (12 marks) has four ELT terms. Candidates supply a definition and an appropriate example for each term. Task 3 (12 marks) has a writing or speaking skills task from a published ELT course or exam material and a number of language features (e.g. ordering information, linking information, use of appropriate salutation) that learners would need to use to complete the activity successfully. Candidates identify three further appropriate language features which learners would need to use to complete the task. Task 4 (20 marks) contains an authentic spoken (transcribed) or written text produced by a learner. Candidates identify a total of four strengths and weaknesses in the text based on specified areas, e.g. use of collocation, communicative success, cohesion. Task 5 (50 marks) contains an authentic text, e.g. a newspaper article, a leaflet, a brochure, a form. Candidates identify features of the text which are typical of the genre and explain the form, meaning, use and phonological features of three different language items/areas highlighted in the text. For one of the areas, candidates may be asked to identify possible learner problems with form, meaning, use and pronunciation, as appropriate. Paper 2 ‚Äì total of 100 marks available Task 1 (18 marks) contains an extract from or a description of a test, along with the context and purpose of its use. Candidates provide an evaluation of its effectiveness for the stated purpose, making six points. Task 2 (42 marks) contains an extract from a published course book. In Part a, candidates identify the purpose of specified individual activities and stages in the material. In Part b, candidates identify how specified activities and stages in the material combine with those discussed in Part A. In Part c, candidates comment on key assumptions about language learning and skills development that are evident in some or all of the activities and stages. Task 3 (40 marks) contains ELT-related input, e.g. from a methodology / resource book, lesson plan extract, transcript of teachers discussing a lesson, tutor feedback. Candidates answer specific questions about the material and discuss implications this view of teaching has for classroom practice. This could involve analysis of current and historical perspectives on approaches and methodologies, theories of language acquisition, resources, and learner and teacher roles. Candidates are marked on the points they make and on the depth of their answer. Module Two ‚Äì Developing professional practice Module Two is assessed through five assignments: * A two-part Professional Development assignment * Two Language System assignments * Two Language Skills assignments. The assignments consist of written essays (2,000-2,500 words per essay) and for the Language System and Language Skills assignments: the planning, teaching and evaluation of a lesson. Assignments are completed throughout the course at intervals determined by the centre. The Professional Development assignment and three of the Language Systems and Language Skills assignments are internally assessed by Delta course tutors. One of the Language Systems or Skills Assignments is externally assessed by a Cambridge English approved external assessor. Assessment of the lesson includes the candidate's evaluation of the lesson, which is sent to the assessor by the centre within 48 hours of the lesson taking place. Professional Development assignment This assignment has two parts: * Part 1: Reflection and action (2,000-2,500 words). A reflective assignment worked on at different stages of the course. * Part 2: Experimental practice (1,500-2,000 words). An investigation into an area of practice which is new for the teacher. The assignment is based on an action plan developed at the start of the course and one observed lesson, which is a diagnostic observation of teaching that informs the rest of the programme. The assignment aims to encourage teachers to reflect on their teaching and experiment with procedures, techniques, materials and resources. The assignment is completed during the course and includes observation and reflection on others‚Äô teaching as well as tutor observation of the candidate's own teaching. The Experimental Practice can be set at any time during the course. Language Systems assignments The assignments consist of a background essay (2,000-2,500 words) exploring an area of language systems and related teaching and learning issues, and the planning, teaching and evaluation of a lesson related to the chosen area. Each of the two assignments must focus on a different area of language systems, e.g. grammar, lexis, phonology, discourse. Language Skills assignments The assignments consist of a background essay (2,000-2,500 words), with research and analysis of an aspect of language skills and related teaching and learning issues, and the planning, teaching and evaluation of a lesson related to the chosen area. One of the assignments must focus on a productive skill (speaking or writing) and the other assignment must focus on a receptive skill (reading or listening). Module Three ‚Äì Extending practice and ELT specialism (option 1) or ELT management (option 2) Module Three is assessed through an Extended Assignment (4,000-4,500 words excluding appendices). Option 1: Extending practice and ELT specialism Candidates carry out an independent investigation, leading to the design of a course programme related to their chosen specialist area. Candidates can select one of the following specialisms: * Business English * Teaching young learners or young adults (age group with 5-year range, e.g. 8-13, 14-19) * English for Specific Purposes (ESP) * English for Academic Purposes (EAP) * Teaching examination classes * Teaching one-to-one * ESOL learners with literacy needs * CLIL / Embedded ESOL * Teaching monolingual classes * Teaching multilingual classes * Teaching in an English-speaking environment * Teaching in a non-English speaking environment * Teaching learners online / through distance or blended learning * Teaching English to learners with special requirements, e.g. visual / hearing impairment, dyslexia * Language development for teachers * Language support, e.g. mainstream teaching programmes, specialist skills support. Candidates can narrow down their specialist area to research a particular aspect in appropriate depth. For example, English for Special Purposes could be narrowed down to: Teaching communication skills to doctors working in a general hospital. Assignments should cover the following five categories in the mark scheme (total marks available 140): * Grasp of topic (maximum 35 marks) ‚Äì review of relevant literature; understanding of key issues; application of knowledge to practice. * Needs analysis and comments (maximum 28 marks) ‚Äì key principles of needs analysis and diagnostic testing; analysis of the diagnostic test and identification of learner needs; discussion and justification of priorities. * Course proposal (maximum 35 marks) ‚Äì key principles of syllabus and course design; justification of learning aims, teaching approach and the course in terms of learner needs; design of course. * Assessment (maximum 28 marks) ‚Äì key principles of different types of assessment; justification of assessment procedures in terms of course design and learner needs; application of assessment procedures. * Presentation and organisation (maximum 14 marks) ‚Äì academic writing, language and referencing; presentation, coherence and organisation; clarity of argument and quality of ideas. Option 2: ELT management Candidates research a chosen ELT Management specialism, leading to the design of a change proposal and implementation plan to overcome issues identified in their analysis. Candidates select one of the following specialisms: * Academic management * Human resource management * Customer service * Marketing Candidates can narrow down their specialist area to research a particular aspect in appropriate depth. For example, Human resource management could be narrowed down to: Staff development. Assignments (4,000-4,500 words in total) should cover the following five categories in the mark scheme: * Introduction: review and key issues (max 1,200 words) ‚Äì rationale for the choice of specialism and review of the key issues including literature review, general ELT management principles and specific principles relating to the chosen specialism * Situation analysis and commentary (max 1,000 words) ‚Äì analysis of the language teaching operation and how the results of this analysis were used to clarify the areas requiring attention * Proposal and justification (max 1,200 words) ‚Äì discussion of the content and structure of the proposed changes in relation to the key issues and principles discussed in Part 1 and the priorities for improvement identified in Part 2 * Implementation (max 900 words) ‚Äì explanation of how the proposed change will be implemented and why (with reference to relevant literature) accompanied by a detailed action plan * Conclusion (max 200 words) ‚Äì consideration of how the proposal is linked to the key issues outlined in the introduction.http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/images/181161-delta-handbook-for- tutors-and-candidates-document.pdf Accessed 18 May 2015 Results Candidates receive a certificate for each module.

Based in Melbourne, the group is most notable for being the first in the series of bands that featured Ross Wilson and Ross Hannaford, which culminated in the hugely successful Daddy Cool. History The Pink Finks formed in early 1965 when 16-year-old R&B; fanatic Ross Wilson joined forces with Rick Dalton and Ross Hannaford's schoolboy outfit The Fauves, which played mainly covers of The Shadows and The Ventures. They were a part-time band, since the members were all still at school at the time. Hannaford, who was only 14 when the band formed, was often driven to concerts by his mother, and had to be sneaked in and out of the licensed venues they played at because he was underage. Money was short and Hannaford played on a low cost acoustic guitar fitted with a Moody sound hole pick-up (without controls) through a Burns Tri-Sonic amplifier provided by Wilson. Inspired by the onslaught of English groups like The Rolling Stones, The Pretty Things and The Yardbirds, the young band's repertoire was chiefly R&B; and blues covers. David Cameron replaced original rhythm guitarist Rick Dalton in early 1965, with Dalton later joining Running Jumping Standing Still, which included Andy Anderson and Doug Ford, both formerly of The Missing Links and Ian Robinson on drums. The Pink Finks released four singles during their brief career; their first, released on their own Mojo label, was a raunchy version of The Kingsmen's \\"Louie Louie\\" and it gave them an early taste of success when it became a local hit (#16) in Melbourne in June 1965. These were followed by covers of The Shirelles' \\"Untie Me\\", Howlin' Wolf's \\"Back Door Man\\" and Spencer Davis Group's \\"It Hurts Me So\\". Franklin, Cameron and Ratz left to go to university in early 1966. It appears from the information in Who's Who of Australian Rock that they were replaced, by Kinman (bass), Lansdown (drums) and Niven (keyboards). Michael Edwards was added on trumpet and sax in August 1966. Jimmy Niven was later a member of the Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band (1973‚Äì76) and The Sports (1976‚Äì80). Richard Franklin later became a successful feature film director; his Australian credits include The True Story of Eskimo Nell, Fantasm, Roadgames and Patrick. After moving to Hollywood he directed Psycho II, Cloak & Dagger, Link and FX2: The Deadly Art of Illusion. In the 1990s, he returned to Australia where he directed Hotel Sorrento, Brilliant Lies and Visitors, before he died of cancer in 2007. David Cameron graduated from NIDA and became an actor, beginning with a role in the ABC's Bellbird, in 1969 and since appeared in string of Australian TV series, miniseries and feature film appearances, including Against the Wind, Dawn!, Water under the Bridge (for which he received a Logie nomination), My First Wife and Mad Max. In 1995, he turned to directing television, commercials and corporate documentaries, including Stingers, SeaChange, Good Guys Bad Guys, State Coroner, Fergus McPhail, The Wayne Manifesto (for which he won an AFI award), Life and Dogwoman. Cameron is currently a teacher at The Australian Film & Television Academy (TAFTA). Wilson and Hannaford moved on to notable bands such as The Party Machine, Sons of the Vegetal Mother, Daddy Cool, and Mighty Kong. Chris Kinman returned to Brisbane in the late 1960s and turned to making guitars and in 1996 invented and patented a new kind of noiseless guitar pick-up. With that event he founded a business called Kinman Guitar Electrix to commercialise his invention. Currently Kinman pick-ups are sold all over the world via www.kinman.com. Hannaford acquired a set of Kinman pick-ups circa 1998. Leigh Lansdown and UK arriviste Duncan Fry formed local band \\"The Harris Tweed Band\\" in 1965 which is still performing mainly in Melbourne's southern suburbs.

Format KOMA broadcasts a classic hits music format featuring popular songs from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. 92.5 history 92.5 was first known as KXLS in 1966. The easy listening music formatted station was owned by Bob Williams, the owner of a high-end sound store. Williams' transmitter and studio combo were located near N. 50th and Santa Fe in Oklahoma City. In the late sixties, KXLS-FM was owned by Bill Dawson's, Dawson Communications, Inc. which also owned (at that time) KMOD-FM, Tulsa, Oklahoma; KXXK-FM, Dallas, Texas; and KMSC-FM, Houston, Texas. The call letters were changed once again in 1973 to KKNG while owned by Swanson Broadcasting. The easy listening format remained in place until the early 1990s. The owners at the time, Wilks Schwartz Broadcasting, determined they wanted to take the station more toward an adult contemporary format to compete with KMGL. AM to FM transition The KOMA call letters made the transition to 92.5 FM on June 22, 1992, after Chicago-based Diamond Broadcasting (then owner) entered a local marketing agreement with Wilks Schwartz Broadcasting. 1520 KOMA continued its simulcast of its FM sister until February 2003, when it was decided that the 50,000-watt AM station would better serve the public as a News/Talk outlet, now known as KOKC. HD radio KOMA along with sister station KRXO-FM broadcast on HD Radio. KOMA airs an alternative rock format on its HD2 subchannel (as \\"92.9 The Edge\\" (simulcast on translator K225BN 92.9 FM Oklahoma City), a classic hip hop format on its HD3 subchannel (as V103, simulcast on translator K276EX 103.1 Oklahoma City). Station ownership changes In May 1998, it was announced that KOMA and sister station, KRXO, were to be purchased by Renda Broadcasting. New digital studios in NE Oklahoma City were constructed. At 3pm on November 9, 1998, KOMA began broadcasting from the new location. The studios, ironically, once housed KOMA's rival, WKY. Danny Williams, Ronnie Kaye and Fred Hendrickson all worked in the building during the 1970s when they were disc jockeys for WKY. After 37 years of broadcasting in Moore, KOMA's studios became vacant and remained unoccupied until 2016 when the building was razed. On July 15, 2012, Ty and Tony Tyler's Tyler Media entered into an agreement with Renda Broadcasting to purchase that company's Oklahoma City radio cluster (KMGL, KOMA, KRXO and KOKC) for $40 million. In accordance to limits imposed by the Federal Communications Commission on the number of radio stations a single broadcasting entity can own in a single market, Tyler sold KTLR and KKNG to WPA Radio for $1.6 million.Is Renda Cashing Out? , RadioInk, July 16, 2012.In Oklahoma City, Tyler spins two so it can buy four from Renda (for $40M) , RadioInfo, July 16, 2012.

The original building, built by Cockram & Cooper Builders and designed by C.R. Heather A.R.V.I.A., consisted of a white dome and two wings (each with a hall). The building was officially opened on 1 April 1922, by the Earl of Stradbroke, and Mayor W.E. Cash. The foundation stone reads: \\"Built in honour of those who served in the Great War 1914-18\\", referring to World War I. The stone on the Eastern Wing (now near the new office extension) reads: \\"C.E. Williams for efforts to establishing a free Public Library in Coburg. 30 June 1923\\". The Coburg Town Hall had the first installed, Australian-designed and constructed film projection unit (Raycophone) in 1930. At the opening night Mayor Cr. Campbell read letters from the Premier and PM Scullin who wrote: \\"If similar steps were taken extensively the present depression would be vastly relieved\\". It is also reported that the dome at the front of the theatre used to show a neon sign saying \\"Talkies\\" until the late 1940s. On the corner of Elm and Urquhart Street is the \\"Coburg City Band and Truby King Rooms\\". The foundation stone was laid on 10 October 1925 by Sir Truby King, and completed on 24 July 1926, with a keystone laid by Mayor Cr. J. Robinson. It was designed by D.McC.Dawnson C.E. and now houses the Elm Grove Infant Welfare Centre. After the amalgamation of the City of Coburg with the City of Brunswick and the southern portion of the City of Broadmeadows in 1994 to form the City of Moreland, the City Hall became the corporate headquarters of the new Moreland City Council (City of Moreland). Following the amalgamation, the City Hall was extended from Bell Street through to Urquhart Street, and included additional function rooms built in 2000.

The equation is named after Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev.

The series converges for x<1 (note, x may be complex), as may be seen by applying the ratio test to the recurrence. The recurrence may be started with arbitrary values of a0 and a1, leading to the two-dimensional space of solutions that arises from second order differential equations. The standard choices are: :a0 = 1 ; a1 = 0, leading to the solution :F(x) = 1 - \\\\frac{p^2}{2!}x^2 + \\\\frac{(p-2)p^2(p+2)}{4!}x^4 - \\\\frac{(p-4)(p-2)p^2(p+2)(p+4)}{6!}x^6 + \\\\cdots and :a0 = 0 ; a1 = 1, leading to the solution :G(x) = x - \\\\frac{(p-1)(p+1)}{3!}x^3 + \\\\frac{(p-3)(p-1)(p+1)(p+3)}{5!}x^5 - \\\\cdots.

Medicine Lake is from the Assiniboine description of the lake, \\"Bda wauka\\" (medicine water). The refuge was established in 1935 to protect habitat for various wildlife and especially migratory birds. The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1980, the Medicine Lake Site was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. Fauna 283 distinct bird species have been documented and of these 125 are known to nest on the refuge. The fifth largest colony of American white pelicans, representing 4,000 breeding pairs, has been recorded. In 2003, a whooping crane was photographed on the refuge and is the first documented sighting of this endangered species ever in the state of Montana. There are only an estimated 300 whooping cranes believed to be in existence. There is one endangered and two threatened species of birds known to inhabit the refuge at least seasonally. Mammals such as the black bear, wolverine, moose, mule deer, bobcat, caribou and pronghorn can be found here as well.

In view of importance of the functions assigned to the Ministry, for it has been developed and simultaneously with ukaz about establishment of the ministries was published Establishment and the order to minister of police, which became a normative basis of its organization and activity. A component of it were Rules of the especial responsibility of minister of police. Operating in force-majeure (definition and conditions force-majeure were not given), minister of police could demand in the order of an army, bypassing military minister and giving direct orders to commanders of regiments. The special paragraph of the General establishment of the ministries provided exemption from liability of minister for excess of authority if it operated in kinds of the general safety. Except for protection of internal security the Ministry of police was allocated with the right to supervise for final execution of laws on all in general to the ministries. Minister of police had the right to demand data from all local bodies, bypassing the corresponding ministries. Decrees, the circulars concerning activity of the local bodies of the various ministries, went to provinces for the official of the Ministry of police who by means of police watched their observance. That the police stood apart from the administrative system, was above it, supervising its activity. Such order has been fixed in Establishment of the Ministry of Finance where was specified that the use of the sums, allocated for local provincial bodies should be made under supervision of the Ministry of police. Leaders of Ministry First minister of police was the general-aide-de-camp of emperor Alexander I Alexander Balashov, who has been appointed into the front-line army from the beginning of Patriotic War of 1812, carrying out especially important missions of Emperor, including negotiations with Napoleon. Acting and actually minister of police, till 1819 was Sergey Vyazmitinov, in the past - the first Minister of Land Forces. Heading the Ministry of police, he was simultaneously the War Governor of Saint Petersburg. By testimonies of contemporaries, how many useless victims of suspicion would fall in Petersburg (in 1812), if not experience and philanthropy of S.K.Vjazmitinov. Structure of Ministry Ministry consisted of three departments: * Department of economic police. The competence of this department included the control over observance of provisioning of cities, especially Saint Petersburg and Moscow, suppression of profiteering, and also supervision for prisons and workhouses. * Department of executive police. This department was formed on the basis of Expedition of the state accomplishment (–≠–∫—Å–ø–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Department consisted of three sections. ** First Section recruited staff for the various police services, collected statistical data, registered the incidents, the facts of a birth and death for what special forms of the account have been introduced. ** Second Section carried out supervision of investigations on criminal cases, and also polices of judgement affairs, supervised execution by police of adjudications. ** Third Section was entrusted for promoting in the organization and carrying out of the general audits of governorates. Capture of deserters and other problems were assigned to it also the maintenance of militia. * Medical department managed sanitary inspection, the organization of efforts on prevention of epidemics and epizootic, supply by medicines. * Also the general and especial offices of minister. Elimination Creation of the Ministry of police has been apprehended by a significant part influential state and public figures with displeasure. Nikolai Karamzin sneered at that when have noticed excessive multicomplexity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, have realized the next reorganization of the central bodies and have created the Ministry of police so multicomplex and not clear for Russian. Incomprehensibility consist, first of all, in granting to the Ministry of police of the right to supervise local bodies of other ministries that put it as though above local institutions. Practice of functioning of the Ministry of police has proved, that its creation has not given expected result but complicated and has confused interaction of local bodies. After the audits of police institutions, the emperor was convinced of the weakness of the police administration. Liquidation of the ministry was predetermined. Viktor Kochubey, in 1819 again appointed to the post of Minister of Internal Affairs, has proved to the czsar necessity of returning of functions of police management to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and liquidation of not popular Ministry of police. After death of Sergey Vyazmitinov a new minister was not appointed. The management of the ministry was temporarily transferred to chairman of Committee of Ministers and manager of Especial office of minister of police reported on his activity personally to the czar. Elimination of the Ministry of police and transfer of its functions to the Ministry of Internal Affairs was regarded by the majority of high-ranking officials of empire as the correct decision. But in the beginning of the reign of emperor Nicholas I the question of creation of the Ministry of police was discussed again.

The game was later ported to the Sord M5 and the MSX. A sequel game, titled Warpman, was released in 1985 for the Family Computer, and featured additional enemy types, powerups and improved graphics and sound. Gameplay Screenshot The player must take control of a \\"Monster Fighter\\", who must shoot tongue-sticking aliens named \\"Berobero\\" (a Japanese onomatopoeic word for licking) in the \\"Space World\\" without letting them touch him. If he kills three Berobero of the same colour in a row, a mysterious alien will appear that can be killed for extra points. When the Warp Zone in the centre of the screen flashes (with the Katakana text in the Japanese version or the English text \\"WARP\\" in the US versions), it is possible for the Monster Fighter to warp to the \\"Maze World\\", where the Berobero must be killed with time-delay bombs. The delay is controlled by how long the player holds the button down - but every time he kills one, his bombs will get stronger, making it easier for the Monster Fighter to blow himself up with his own bombs until he returns to Space World.

Early career Cook grew up in Carnarvon where he played for the Warriors FC and he spent his last year of school and underage football with St Patricks in Geraldton. In 1993 he was a member of the WA Under 18 team playing alongside future team-mates Shaun McManus and Peter Bell. Cook played 40 games for Perth in the West Australian Football League between 1994 & 1996 and was runner-up in the Sandover Medal in 1996. Sydney Swans At the 1996 AFL Draft Cook was chosen at pick 26 by the Swans. Cook spent the next 3 years developing his skills under coach Rodney Eade. During his time at Sydney he perfected one of his greatest assets, his tackling. He also worked with assistant coach Damian Drum who he would later meet again at Fremantle. Fremantle Dockers On his return to WA in 2000 Cook immediately showed he was determined to be a part of the Fremantle line-up with a strong pre-season and impressive early form. By the end of the season he had played all 22 games, lead the club in disposals and was named the club champion. 2003 onwards Cook played all 88 regular season games (a club record for consecutive games at the time) in his first four seasons at Fremantle, but broke his ankle in the final round of 2003, forcing him to miss Fremantle's first ever finals match. Recovering from the broken ankle, he started the 2004 season in the WAFL before eventually playing 18 games. He missed two games late in the season with a hamstring strain and was used mainly in defence. As hard at the ball as ever and, despite his slow start to the season, was fifth on Fremantle's tackles list. On 26 August 2007 Cook announced that 2007 will be his final season of AFL football. He played his 150th and final match in Round 22, 2007, against Port Adelaide, earning him life membership of the Fremantle Dockers.

History In 1941 the Australian Broadcasting Commission decided to nationalise its Children's programs, broadcast from Sydney with Ida Elizabeth Osbourne as its first producer. In 1942 she commissioned Ruth Park to write a dramatised series, The Wide‚ÄìAwake Bunyip. The first episode was aired in January 1943, with \\"Joe\\" (Albert Collins) in the title role. When he died, in 1951, Ruth changed the title to The Muddle‚ÄìHeaded Wombat, with Leonard Teale the first to play the part. When Leonard left, John Ewart \\"Jimmy\\" made it his for the next 18 years. The part of his friend \\"Mouse\\" in both incarnations was played by the current female co-presenter. When John E. C. Appleton was made Supervisor of Children's Programs and keen to be involved, the part of \\"Tabby Cat\\" was created for him. The narrator throughout was \\"Mac\\" (Atholl Fleming). The popularity of the series (which ended when the Children's Hour was cancelled in 1970) led Ruth Park to write her Muddle‚ÄìHeaded Wombat books. Synopsis The Muddle-Headed Wombat books follow the Muddle-Headed Wombat and his friends, a good-natured, practical female mouse and a vain, neurotic male tabby cat. The characters call each other simply Wombat, Mouse and Tabby. Wombat's speech is peppered with malapropisms and spoonerisms, e.g. treely ruly for really and truly, lawn the mow for mow the lawn and Cindergorilla for Cinderella. He has a bicycle with red wheels, of which he is intensely proud and which he anthropomorphises, e.g. complaining that it bit him when he accidentally injured himself trying to repair it.

This small village of migrant farmers and native Adivasi communities has been developing as an important centre of Idukki. Various spice products provide the life blood for this village and market. Murickassery is situated in Vathikkudy Grama Panchayath. History The history of Murickassery can be divided into the pre peasant migratory period and the post peasant migratory periods. The landmass now known as Murickassery and its surrounding regions were once thickly inhabited by the indigenous populace called the Mannans. The term Murickassery is itself derived from the Mannan dialect. There are two contradictory views regarding how the place got the name Murickassery. In the opinion of the first group the name Murickassery is derived from the term Muikkencheri or the Chery or the residential place of the Mannan Kani or headman of the region named Murikken. On the other hand, it has been said that, there was a large Kattu Mulmurikku or a thorny plant in Murickassery. The Mannans of the region named the Chery or the place or region where the Kattu Mulmurikku grew as Murickkin Chery and in the course of time it became Murickassery. The non-existence of a Mannan kudi in Murickassery and the non-usage of Chery as the suffix of their kudis by the Mannan (instead, the Mannan used the term kudi to specify their settlements, as in Thopramkudy, Vathikkudy, Maniyarenkudy) shows that the second argument may probably be more convincing.

Pavanatma College is the backbone of this small centre of education. St Mary's Higher Secondary school has enlightened two generation of students. Now they live in the various parts of the world. This was also a place for private tutorial colleges and tuition centres. Unemployed youths found bread from these small educational institutions. Lower middle class farmers of Murickassery and nearby villages including Thopramkudy, Padamugham, Moongappara, Parathode, Mannathara, Rajamudy, Pathinaramkandam, Poomamkandam, Kambilikandam, Melechinnar etc. find a better place for school and college education in Murickassery.

It is a commonly taken teaching qualification in the field of English language learning and teaching (ELT). It is one of various TEFL qualifications available. About the qualification The Trinity CertTESOL is designed for those with little or no experience of teaching English. It provides the basic skills and knowledge needed to take up a first post as an ESOL teacher. The program also gives an introduction to theory and an insight into the challenges facing the learner and the role of the teacher. It is also suitable for those with classroom experience, but without any formal TESOL training or qualifications. The qualification is awarded upon passing a course which includes supervised and observed teaching practice, written assignments and an interview with an external moderator. The CertTESOL is accredited in the United Kingdom by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority at Level 5 on the UK National Qualifications Framework. Extension certificates=Teaching Young Learners Extension Certificate (TYLEC) The Trinity TYLEC module is intended for already qualified teachers‚Äîparticularly those with pre-existing CertTESOL certificates. Its aim is to instruct ESL teachers on how to correctly teach English as a foreign language to children and teens (Ages 7-16) The TYLEC is roughly equivalent to the now discontinued Cambridge CELTA-YL extension. Availability The Trinity CertTESOL is available in many different countries throughout the world, and some institutions offer a portion of the course in the form of distance learning. The course can be taken part-time over several months to a year, or full-time in a four- or five-week period. The Trinity College London Certificate in TESOL is available as a full-time course for 5 weeks at Cochin International Language Academy (CILA) located in Angamaly, Cochin, Kerala. The website of CILA, Kerala is www.cilakerala.com Experienced teachers can further their career by taking a more advanced diploma, the LTCL DipTESOL. This is often seen as a follow-up to the CertTESOL. Admission requirements The Trinity CertTESOL is open to all those for whom English is a first, second or foreign language. Your own use of spoken and written English will need to be of an appropriate standard for you to be a role model of English for your learners and help them understand the nature of the language. The validation guidelines set out the requirements - these include a minimum age of 18 and evidence of qualifications achieved for entry to higher education in the UK (A levels) or equivalent. Comparative qualifications The Trinity CertTESOL, as per CELTA, is recognized and accepted by the British Council as an initial TESOL qualification for teachers in its accredited teaching organisations in the UK and in its own teaching operations overseas. Both have at least one hundred hours of instruction and six hours of supervised teaching practice. Similarly, the LTCL DipTESOL, as per DELTA, is accredited in the UK at Level 7 on the National Qualifications Framework, as are postgraduate diploma, aka PGDip.

Career Juan Manuel Lebron began his show business career as a youngster, then when he became a singer at the Sexteto Ritmico group. Not long after, Lebron became the lead singer of Orquesta Sensacional, a popular salsa orchestra of the era. In 1976, Lebron made his debut as an actor, when he was hired to play \\"JuanMa\\" in channel 2's comedy show, \\"En Casa de JuanMa y Wiwi\\" (\\"At JuanMa and Wiwi's Home\\"). Lebron acted alongside Awilda Carbia, who played \\"JuanMa\\"'s wife \\"Wiwi\\". The pair became one of Puerto Rico's most popular television couples in history, and their show lasted fourteen years on Puerto Rican television. In 1978, Lebron was recognized with the Diplo comedian of the year award, an award given to Puerto Rican comedy actors. By 1980, he had been recognized by the Puerto Rican Junior Commerce Chamber as one of the \\"top ten Puerto Rican youngsters\\". Having already participated in his first album (as a member of Orquesta Sensacional), Lebron in 1982 released a single. \\"Amores sin Sentido\\" (\\"Pointless Loves\\"), which became a chart topper in Puerto Rico. By then, he formed part, alongside Lourdes Chacon, Otilio Warrington, Shorty Castro and Adri√°n Garc√≠a, among others, of another comedy show, \\"Los Kakukomicos\\" (\\"The Telemundo Comedians\\"). In \\"Los Kakukomicos\\", Lebron formed part of a mock music group that satirized Menudo, a well known boy band of the era. He and Warrington also became popular as a comic duo as time went by. In 1985, Lebron represented Puerto Rico in the Festival OTI for Latin American singers. He sang \\"Represento\\", a major hit song that was written by Lou Briel. One of the people who backed the choosing of Lebron as Puerto Rico's participant at that festival was Lola Flores. In 1986, Lebron was awarded the \\"Buho de Oro\\" trophy in Panama as a popular entertainer in that Central American country, where he earned a golden album that same year, for the sales produced by his album, \\"Represento\\". During the 1980s also, Lebron was a popular talk show visitor, being invited to many of Puerto Rico's talk shows on multiple occasions. In 1990, production of \\"En Casa de JuanMa y Wiwi\\" ceased, and Lebron released another album, \\"El Primero\\" (\\"The First One\\"), of which one single, \\"Ella y Tu\\" (\\"You and Her\\"), earned Lebron a nomination for salsa singer of the year at the Premios Lo Nuestro awards. The album reached number-one on the Billboard Tropical Albums chart. By 1992, Lebron was chosen by channel 2 as their spokesman for the yearlong celebrations of the quicentennial of the discovery of the Americas by Cristobal Colon. He represented Puerto Rico at the Expo '92, which was held that year in Sevilla, Spain. Lebron in 1993 received the Paoli award as Puerto Rican salsa singer of the year. He has released a total of nine albums or CD's; these include dedications to Nat King Cole and Tito Rodriguez and a production, \\"Una Obra de Amor\\" (\\"An Act of Love\\"), which was later re-edited and dedicated to children with HIV. In 1995, Lebron made his Hollywood debut in \\"Assassins\\", with Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas. \\"Assassins\\" remains as Lebron's only Hollywood movie. Juan Manuel Lebron and Junior Abrahms, a former sportscaster turned actor and show host, are in charge of hosting a game show named \\"Atrevete\\" (\\"Dare\\"). Nevertheless, he has dabbed in on Telemundo Puerto Rico's main rival, WAPA-TV, making sporadic appearances at WAPA shows, usually when friends of his work at a particular WAPA show. He also acted in \\"Los Seijo-Dones\\" (\\"The Seijo-Dones Family\\") and \\"Anda Pa'l Cara\\" (which loosely translates to \\"Holy Cow!\\"). Lebron has also collaborated on many television commercials, for companies such as AT&T;, Eastern Air Lines, Gulf Oil and Church's fried chicken, among others. Juan Manuel Lebron has also acted on theater plays. In 2005, he participated in his third film, (along with Conexion Caribe and Assassins) Puerto Rican production \\"El Vacilon: The Movie\\" (\\"Goofing Off: The Movie\\").

It was in 1980 that Dr√∂scher was introduced to the reclusive German physicist Burkhard Heim, thereby becoming one of the few physicists to collaborate with Heim. Research Dr√∂scher quickly familiarised himself with the theory and so was able to ensure that Volume II of Heim's work on elementary particle physics was essentially error free. Volume I contained errors that were only later corrected, with the help of Dr√∂scher and others. As he got to know the theory better, he saw that by re- introducing the 7th and 8th dimensions discarded from what had become Heim's 6-dimensional theory, two new forces could be derived which are related to normal gravity.

During his reign, he at times used the Jin-created title of Duke of Xiping, but when forced to submit to Han Zhao and Later Zhao, he used the title Prince of Liang. Late in his reign, even when not under Later Zhao's pressure, he claimed the title of \\"Acting Prince of Liang.\\" During the brief reign of his son Zhang Zuo, he was honored as Prince Wen of Liang (Ê∂ºÊñáÁéã). The Book of Jin describes Zhang Jun as having an extraordinary appearance and was talented at literature, however he was also an extravagant and dissipated man.  Early life  Zhang Jun was the son of Zhang Shi (ÂºµÂØî), the Jin governor of Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, modern central and western Gansu) and the Duke of Xiping. In 320, Zhang Shi was assassinated by his guards Yan She (ÈñªÊ∂â) and Zhao Ang (Ë∂ôÂç¨), who were followers of the magician Liu Hong (ÂäâÂºò), who had falsely prophesied that he would be the ruler of Liang Province. Zhang Shi's brother Zhang Mao captured and executed Liu and his followers. Because Zhang Jun was still young (aged 13) at the time, Zhang Shi's subordinates requested that Zhang Mao take over the governorship. (Because Zhang Mao also declared a general pardon at the time, a power normally reserved for an emperor, this was often viewed as the date of Former Liang's independence from Jin.) Zhang Mao made Zhang Jun a general, and later in the year named him his heir. In 324, Zhang Mao died, and Zhang Jun succeeded him. Because Zhang Mao had previously been forced to submit to Han Zhao and was given the title the Prince of Liang, Zhang Jun carried that title as well, even though internally he used the Jin-vested title of Duke of Xiping.  Early reign  In 326, Zhang Jun, in fear of Han Zhao, forcibly relocated the people of Longxi (Èö¥Ë•ø) and Nan'an (ÂçóÂÆâ, collectively roughly Dingxi, Gansu) Commanderies to the capital Guzang (ÂßëËáß, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). He also sought peace with Cheng Han's emperor Li Xiong and further tried to persuade Li Xiong to become a Jin vassal. Li Xiong agreed to peace and further did not completely rebuff Zhang Jun's overture, but also did not actually become a Jin vassal. In 327, after hearing news that Han Zhao had suffered losses at Later Zhao's hands, Zhang Jun disavowed all titles granted by Han Zhao and returned to Jin titles, and attacked Han Zhao's Qin Province (Áß¶Â∑û, modern eastern Gansu). Han Zhao's prince Liu Yin counterattacked, and, after defeating Former Liang general Han Pu (ÈüìÁíû), captured all Former Liang territory south of the Yellow River and further crossed the river, but did not advance further. However, Zhang Jun did not resubmit to Han Zhao. As Han Zhao disintegrated and fell to Later Zhao in 329 after its emperor Liu Yao was captured by Later Zhao forces, Former Liang took the opportunity to regain lands south of the Yellow River. In 330, Later Zhao's emperor Shi Le sent messengers to persuade Former Liang to submit (by granting him honors, including the nine bestowments), but Zhang Jun refused and detained Shi Le's messengers. Later in the year, however, after Later Zhao's general Shi Sheng (Áü≥Áîü) the Prince of Hedong defeated the nearby Xiongnu chieftain Shi Qiang (Áü≥Áæå), Zhang Jun became apprehensive and submitted to Later Zhao. In 333, in the aftermaths of Shi Le's death and the coup by his nephew Shi Hu, a number of Later Zhao generals rebelled and tried to seek Jin and Former Liang assistance. Former Liang tried to ally itself with one of these generals, the Di chief Pu Hong (Ëí≤Ê¥™). However, in light of Shi Hu's victory over most of the other generals, Pu soon submitted to Shi Hu. Shi Hu, however, did not appear to consider attacking Former Liang, and, not having to fight Later Zhao for years, by 335 Zhang Jun's domain was described as being so rich and strong and under his capable leadership that it also became overlord over a number of Xiyu (Ë•øÂüü, collective name for modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) kingdoms, which offered tribute to Zhang Jun. He submitted a plan to Emperor Cheng of Jin requesting to attack Later Zhao and/or Cheng Han jointly with Jin forces, but the plan was not acted upon by Emperor Cheng.  Late reign  In 339, Zhang Jun transferred some of his authorities to his heir apparent, Zhang Chonghua. In 340, he offered tribute to Shi Hu, but in his petition he used arrogant words. Shi Hu was angered and wanted to kill his messenger, but Shi Hu's official Shi Pu (Áü≥Áíû) was able to persuade him to overlook Zhang Jun's arrogance. In 344, a battle between Former Liang and Later Zhao forces was mentioned, perhaps indicating that the relationship was not as peaceful as before. In early 346, Zhang Jun attacked the Xiyu kingdom Yanqi (ÁÑâËÄÜ, in modern Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang), and Yanqui submitted to him. By this point, he was described as having taken the title Acting Prince of Liang (ÂÅáÊ∂ºÁéã) and using styles that were usually reserved for emperors. In summer 346, Zhang Jun died, and was succeeded by his heir apparent Zhang Chonghua.  Era name?  Most historical sources indicate that Zhang Jun, like his father Zhang Shi and his uncle Zhang Mao, continued to use Emperor Min of Jin's era name Jianxing (both to show continued allegiance to Jin and to distance himself from Emperor Yuan of Jin and his line) but some sources indicate that he changed era name to Taiyuan (Â§™ÂÖÉ t√†i yu√°n 324‚Äì346). A current theory is that his era name was used internally while the Jianxing era name was used when communicating with other states.

The Security Council decided that a solution to the Kosovar crisis was to be based upon the agreed principles contained in the annexes of the resolution.The Security Council Resolution n. 1244/1999 could give pardon to NATO intervention ‚Äì by reference to the armistice agreements between NATO and the Yugoslav government, made into paragraph 10 of its Annex 2 ‚Äì only if the prohibition of the use of force (provided in Article 2 paragraph 4 UN Charter) is seen as a rule which can be waived with the consent of the international community: It welcomed Serbia's (then part of the \\"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\") acceptance of the principles and demanded co-operation in their implementation. At the same time, the Council demanded that the Serbia put an end to repression in Kosovo and begin a phased withdrawal; after withdrawal a small number of Yugoslav and Serbian military and police personnel could return to Kosovo, if authorized by the international military presence, to carry out functions contained in the annex of the resolution. The resolution then authorized an international civil and security presence in Kosovo. The Secretary-General was requested to appoint a Special Representative to co- ordinate the implementation of the international presence. The Council authorized countries and international organisations to establish a security presence in Kosovo, affirming the need for the immediate deployment of the international civil and security presences. The responsibilities of the international security presence included deterring new hostilities, monitoring the withdrawal of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, demilitarising the Kosovo Liberation Army and other Kosovo Albanian groups and ensuring a safe environment in which refugees could return. The Secretary-General was authorized to establish an international civilian presence in Kosovo to provide an interim administration whereby Kosovo could exercise governance ‚Äì pending a final status solution ‚Äì through the establishment of provisional institutions of self-government. The main responsibilities of the international civil presence included the promotion of autonomy for Kosovo, performing civilian administrative functions, overseeing the development of the institutions including the holding of elections, maintaining law and order, protecting human rights and ensuring the safe return of refugees. The Council emphasized the need for humanitarian relief operations and encouraged all states and organisations to contribute towards economic and social reconstruction. All parties, including the international presence, had to co- operate with the ICTY. It demanded that armed Kosovar groups end their offensives. Finally, it was decided that the international civil and security presences were to be established for an initial period of 12 months, while the Secretary-General was requested to keep the Council informed on developments. Unusually for UN peace-keeping missions, this one was to continue after the initial 12-month period unless the Security Council determined otherwise: normally, the continuing mandate of missions is subject to resolutions after 12 months which allow for revisions to the original mandate. Summary The main features of Resolution 1244 were to: *Demand in particular that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia put an immediate and verifiable end to violence and repression in Kosovo; *Complete verifiable phased withdrawal from Kosovo of all military, police and paramilitary forces according to a rapid timetable, with which the deployment of the international security presence in Kosovo will be synchronized; * Place Kosovo under interim UN administration (performed by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK); * Authorize international peacekeeping force with substantial NATO participation in Kosovo (currently performed by the Kosovo Force, KFOR); * Allow for the return of an agreed number of Yugoslav and Serbian personnel to maintain a presence at Serbian Patrimonial sites and key border crossings; * Direct UNMIK to establish provisional institutions of local self-government in Kosovo (PISG); * Reaffirm the commitment of UN member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region, as set out in the Helsinki Final Act and annex 2 of UNSCR 1244 (an annex that both affirms the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and envisions, inter alia, a Kosovo status process); * Require the UN to assure the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes in Kosovo and to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all inhabitants of the province; * Require that the KLA and other armed Kosovo Albanian groups be demilitarized; * Authorize the United Nations to facilitate a political process to determine Kosovo's future status. Kosovo's future status would take into consideration the Rambouillet Agreement which Serbia refused to sign in 1998, and which calls for the \\"will of the people of Kosovo\\" to be one of the guiding principles in defining Kosovo's status, another being the respective compliance of the disputing parties to the Agreement. The resolution reaffirms calls for \\"substantial autonomy and meaningful self-administration for Kosovo\\".  Significance = Serbian stance  Article 1 of the Helsinki Final Act places a high value on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of existing states. In a similar fashion the references to autonomy in 1244 articles indicate a desire by UN Member-States at that time to return Kosovo to a pre-1990 autonomous status, if possible. But the EU's Venice Commission noted that: \\"With respect to substantial autonomy, an examination of the Constitution, and more specifically of Part VII, makes it clear that this substantial autonomy of Kosovo is not at all guaranteed at the constitutional level, as the Constitution delegates almost every important aspect of this autonomy to the legislature....it is clear that ordinary law can restrict the autonomy of the Provinces. This possibility of restricting the autonomy of the Provinces by law is confirmed by almost every article of Part 7 of the Constitution... Hence, in contrast with what the preamble announces, the Constitution itself does not at all guarantee substantial autonomy to Kosovo, for it entirely depends on the willingness of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia whether self-government will be realised or not.\\" \\"Substantial autonomy\\" under the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution required Kosovo acceptance of any laws restricting its authority. Serbia sought international validation for its stance, and in October 2008 requested a judgement from the International Court of Justice. However, the Court ruled that the declaration of independence was legal.  Kosovo Albanian stance  On 17 February 2008 representatives of Albanians living in Kosovo, acting outside the UNMIK's PISG framework (not representing the Assembly of Kosovo or any other of these institutions),The identity of the authors of the declaration of independence, ICJ ruling, par.102‚Äì109 issued a declaration of independence establishing the Republic of Kosovo. On 22 July 2010 the International Court of Justice ruled that the declaration of independence of 17 February 2008 did not violate general international law, Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) or the Constitutional Framework, because the authors of the declaration, who named themselves \\"representatives of the people of Kosovo\\" were not bound by those documents. The declaration of independence was legal. A key argument on the Kosovars' side was that Article 1 and article 8 of the Helsinki Final Act makes the continued territorial integrity of sovereignty of states conditional upon their willingness and ability to guarantee the fundamental human rights also defined in the Final Act.

Storm Warning was the follow-up novel to the highly successful 1975 bestseller The Eagle Has Landed. Higgins takes to the sea in this wartime thriller which matches the standard of his novels of this period. The setting is the sailing ship, 'Deutschland' and we are placed on it with the rest of the crew. Plot introduction A German Barque merchant ship is attempting to return to Germany from Brazil at the end of August 1944 via a crossing of the Atlantic which is full of enemy shipping and warships. With a crew of twenty-two men and five nuns as passengers, the boat makes its remarkable journey, but after being severely battered by a storm, is wrecked off the coast of Scotland on the Washington Reef in the Outer Hebrides. The conclusion may sound familiar to some as Higgins has obviously taken some ideas (especially the ones regarding the shipwreck) from an earlier novel he wrote called 'A Game For Heroes', in which German soldiers and British citizens try to rescue the crew of a ship that has foundered off the coast of the Jersey islands. Once again, the protagonists are enemies that come together to help each other in time of need.

He was also Baron of Loughneagh (1660, Ireland), 6th Baron Oriel (1790, Ireland), and 6th Baron Oriel (1821, UK), and served as a Deputy Lieutenant for County Antrim. He succeeded his father in 1956 and regularly attended the House of Lords. Early years Educated at Eton College, in 1939 Whyte-Melville-Skeffington married Annabelle Kathleen, daughter of the late Henry D. Lewis, of Combwell Priory, Kent. They had one son, the future 14th Viscount and one daughter. He was a lieutenant in the Black Watch regiment 1933‚Äì36, and again in 1939, invalided out in 1940 due to wounds received in action. He served in the Small Vessels Pool, Royal Navy, in 1944. He was Gold Staff Officer at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Political activities Viscount Masserene and Ferrard was President of Brighton Kemptown Conservative Association, and Vice-President and Treasurer of the Ashford, Kent, Conservative Division. He was a member of the Inter- Parliamentary Union Delegation to Spain in 1960, and Commodore of the House of Lords Yacht Club, 1972 - 1985. He was Joint Deputy Chairman (1965 - 1970) and Whip of the Conservative Peers Committee (IUP) in the House of Lords 1965 - 1970. Lord Masserene and Ferrard was responsible for introducing to Parliament the Deer Act in 1963, the Export of Animals for Research Bill 1968, the Riding Establishments Act 1970, the Valerie Mary Hill and Alan Monk (Marriage Enabling) Bill 1984, and moved debates on Overseas Information Services and other matters. He was Commissioner to the Hunterston Ore Terminal Hearing, Glasgow, 1973. In 1976, he was on the parliamentary delegation to Malawi, and the same year served on the Parliamentary Select committee on the Anglian Water Authority Bill. He was for over twenty years an active member of the Conservative Monday Club. In 1981, he succeeded the 6th Marquess of Salisbury as Club President, a post he held until January 1991, when he stood down. Business and other activities Lord Massereene was the driver of the leading British car in the Le Mans Grand Prix D'endurance in 1937, and promoted the first scheduled air service between Glasgow-Oban-Isle of Mull, 1968. He was a Freeman of the City of London, and a liveryman of the Shipwrights' Company. He was one of the original pioneers in the commercial development of Cape Canaveral, and a director of numerous companies. He was for some time a member of the Senechal Council of Canterbury Cathedral, a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, and a Vice-President of the Kent branch of the Royal British Legion. He was also chairman of the Victoria League, Kent. Estates A very extensive landowner, his English seat was at Chilham Castle, Kent. The Norman Keep of the Castle, which is the oldest building in the village and still inhabited, dates from 1174 and was said to have been built for King Henry II. But archaeological excavations carried out in the 1920s suggest that it stands on the foundations of a much older Anglo-Saxon fortification, possibly dating from the 5th century, and there is evidence of earlier Roman habitation in the vicinity. The Jacobean building, now known as the Castle, was constructed in 1616 for Sir Dudley Digges, reputedly to a design by Inigo Jones. It is one of the finer mansions in the south-east and commands exceptional views across the valley of the River Stour, Kent. The gardens, originally laid out by John Tradescant the elder, were redesigned in the 18th century under the guidance of Capability Brown and include a fine terrace leading down to a fishing lake. The walls to the grounds also date from this time (1720), although the two gatehouses were only added in the 1920s He also owned the Knock estate on the Isle of Mull, as well as estates in Ireland, notably Antrim Castle near the Six Mile Water in county Antrim, Ulster. It was set alight in a night time raid by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1922 and destroyed. Massereene was in the castle with his parents at the time. All that remains is an octagonal tower.

Sam Jordison, The Guardian, 4 December 2007. Retrieved 1 February 2014. The book details three generations of a family during the aftermath of a nuclear war. The survivors of the blast suffer through radiation, nuclear winter, feuds between rival groups and radiation-induced mutations, eventually evolving into a new species, Homo superior. The new species has adapted to the loss of the ozone layer and the abundant radiation, and will become the dominant species on the planet. The book contains three sections, one for each generation. The novel offers some hope that humanity could survive the horrors of war (as an allegory for the current age) in order to form a new world. Plot summary=Sarah When the air raid sirens go off, Sarah, a schoolgirl in England, runs home to help her stepmother, Veronica, prepare the living room to protect the family from a nuclear fallout. Sarah and Veronica assemble living provisions, rudimentary sanitary supplies, and clothes and toys for Veronica's son William (aged five) and daughter Catherine (aged eight). The family then shelter inside as the bombs fall. Sarah realises that the water the rest of the family has been using has become contaminated with radioactive particles from the unblocked chimney, and all apart from Catherine are likely to contract radiation sickness. Veronica displays symptoms first and leaves the house several times to collect canned (safe) food for Catherine. She tells Sarah that community members have gathered in the church and a local farmer is giving away contaminated meat for free. Later, when her symptoms become worse, Veronica leaves, presumably to die. William also begins to suffer from radiation sickness, and when he is near death and Sarah begins to weaken she leaves the house, bundling Catherine up against contamination. She gathers food for her from the house of the town farmer and takes her to the remote home of Johnson. Johnson has been prepared for the war, and appears unaffected by radiation sickness. During the time of the nuclear fall out Sarah has to take on the role as a mother due to Veronica saying that she is going to give up but Sarah refuses to let Veronica give up on herself. Ophelia This section begins with a flashback to the day of the war, which reveals that Sarah's father, Bill, a lecturer at Bristol University, was driving to a meeting when a woman named Erica flagged him down. As a leading authority on cellular cloning, she had a pass granting her (and anyone accompanying her) shelter in a government bunker. Bill takes Erica to the bunker at Avon, but had mixed feelings about surviving when his wife and children did not. Within two months of the war, Britain is gripped by a nuclear winter. When the nuclear winter finally ends, the authorities send helicopters on reconnaissance missions, which reveal that against all odds, there are people still alive outside. They also learn that the ozone layer has been damaged, so anyone who goes outside must wear protective clothing. Erica feels it is her duty as a woman still of child-bearing age to help repopulate society, so she marries Bill and gives birth to a daughter, Ophelia. Bill is assigned to teach the bunker's teenagers, and, though he is officially meant to teach science-based subjects, introduces subjects such as English literature and politics into the curriculum. Ophelia spends the first sixteen years of her life in the bunker, where she calmly accepts the restrictions on her life. But other youngsters, in particular an Anglo-American youth named Dwight Allison, are not so accepting. Under the influence of Bill's teachings, Dwight has come to believe that General MacAllister, the man in charge of the bunker, has too much authority and, one day, spray-paints a slogan denouncing MacAllister as a \\"fascist pig\\". As a punishment, Dwight is sentenced to a year of hard labour and expelled from school. Some time later, a large herd of cattle is found in one of the outside communities. MacAllister orders Dwight's father, Colonel Jeff Allison, to bring the cattle to the bunker for \\"government protection\\". Dwight believes it would be wrong to take the cattle when the outsiders depend on them for survival and hurries to tell Bill. Bill and Dwight decide that the best course of action would be to leave the bunker and warn the community which owns the cattle; Ophelia accompanies them, but she does so because they are the people she is closest to, not because she feels they are doing the right thing. Outside, the world is recovering from the effects of the war and Ophelia is able to experience things she has previously only known about via her father's lessons. They discover the cattle owners are Johnson's community, and Bill is soon reunited with Catherine, who is heavily pregnant with her eighth child. She married Johnson when she was in her teens, but six of the children she has already given birth to have died in infancy due to genetic mutation. Since Johnson is old enough to be Catherine's father, Ophelia is disgusted, thinking the outsiders are uncivilised compared to the people in the bunker. Dwight retorts that the latter are like \\"dinosaurs\\", attempting to maintain pre-war standards of living and not adapting to the changed conditions in the world. During the course of the day, Ophelia meets Catherine's only surviving daughter, Lilith, who was born with white eyes and pale hairs all over her body. Since there is no other community which can handle a herd the size of Johnson's, Bill and Dwight are unable to get the cattle away before Colonel Allison and his men come to collect them. Johnson attempts to compromise by offering Colonel Allison enough cattle to form the basis of a herd, but Colonel Allison says he is not in a position to negotiate. Realising the discussion is going nowhere, Dwight sabotages all but one of the Army trucks, making it impossible to take the cattle back to the bunker, and escapes into the wilderness. Ophelia wants to return to the bunker, even though doing so means she will never see Dwight again. The section ends with Ophelia in tears, as Lilith (with her newborn sister in her arms) smiles at her pityingly. Simon Five decades after the war, the bunker is decaying and fuel supplies have run out, and the people in the bunker have been forced to seek sanctuary among outside communities. On one such expedition, Ophelia's son, Simon, sees a pack of wild dogs stalking a person who is searching the ruins of an old house. He fires his gun, killing one of the dogs and scattering the rest, then goes to help the person they were stalking. proves to be a mutant girl named Laura, who tells him that \\"weapons are evil\\" and that he has no right to kill a living thing. When Simon sees that Laura's body is covered with hair (which protects her skin from being damaged by ultra-violet radiation), he is repulsed by her, thinking she is an \\"ape\\". Shortly after meeting Laura, Simon injures his leg on a rusty nail. Since his people have no means to treat injuries, he is taken to Johnson's community, where Laura lives. Rather than having separate homes for each family, the community consists of a large \\"house\\" which reminds Simon of a Tibetan monastery. Seeing the well-ordered community where people have learned to make everything they need themselves, Simon begins to feel that his own people are \\"failures\\", having tried to restore pre-war standards at the expense of their children's futures. Simon meets Catherine, now known as \\"Blind Kate,\\" blind after years of exposure to ultraviolet radiation and covered in festering sores. Simon sees in her a glimpse of his own future and, on learning that she is Laura's grandmother, is so repulsed at the thought of being related to a mutant that he can not bring himself to acknowledge it. Instead, when Laura asks if he has ever heard of the people who once came to the community to take the cattle, he claims not to know them. The next morning, Simon finds himself the topic of much discussion among the mutants. Unable to bear being the subject of pity, he storms out of the dining hall and, following a vitriolic lecture from blind Kate, leaves the settlement even though his leg is not fully healed. He plans to catch up with the rest of his party, but a pack of dogs chases him into a ruined church. While there, he sees a glider flying overhead. The glider's pilot alerts Laura's people to Simon's whereabouts. Laura rides to the rescue on her horse and uses her psychic powers to send the dogs away. She tells Simon that she and the rest of the mutants have developed telekinetic powers and the ability to communicate telepathically. She believes the mutants are a new species of humans, but they need the technical knowledge Simon's people have kept alive if they are to reach their full potential. Simon comes to terms with what his ancestors did to the world and realises that although he can not change the past, he can do something positive with his own life by helping his people collaborate with the mutants. He comes to believe that the nuclear war was meant to happen, so that Laura (whom he finally acknowledges as his cousin) and the rest of her kind could be born. Catherine initially acknowledged Ophelia who she met during the cattle mission, but Simon denied any knowledge of her. However at this point he finally admits to Laura that he is in fact her son. Laura was angry at first for Simon lying to her and denying an old woman the pleasure of meeting another family member, but then comes to terms with the situation. She takes Simon on her horse back to the house where he will reveal all and use his knowledge to allow the new generation to expand their skills and make the new way of life a better place like it once was.

A cycloalkyne consists of a closed ring of carbon atoms containing one or more triple bonds. Cycloalkynes have a general formula CnH2n‚àí4. Because of the linear nature of the C‚ÄìC‚â°C‚ÄìC alkyne unit, cycloalkynes can be highly strained and can only exist when the number of carbon atoms in the ring is great enough to provide the flexibility necessary to accommodate this geometry. Large alkyne-containing carbocycles may be virtually unstrained, while the smallest constituents of this class of molecules may experience so much strain that they have yet to be observed experimentally. Cyclooctyne (C8H12) is the smallest cycloalkyne capable of being isolated and stored as a stable compound.Cycloalkyne (chemical compound) ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia Despite this, smaller cycloalkynes can be produced and trapped through reactions with other organic molecules or through complexation to transition metals. Background Ring size determines the stability of simple cycloalkynes Due to the significant geometric constraints imposed by the R‚ÄìC‚â°C‚ÄìR functionality, cycloalkynes smaller than cyclodecyne (C10H16) result in highly strained structures. While the cyclononyne (C9H14) and cyclooctyne (C8H12) are isolable (though strongly reactive) compounds, cycloheptyne (C7H10), cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclopentyne (C5H6) only exist as transient reaction intermediates or as ligands coordinating to a metal center. There is little experimental evidence supporting the existence of cyclobutyne (C4H4) or cyclopropyne (C3H2), aside from studies reporting the isolation of an osmium complex with cyclobutyne ligands. Initial studies which demonstrated the transient intermediacy of the seven-, six- and five-membered cycloalkynes relied on trapping of the high-energy alkyne with a suitable reaction partner, such as a cyclic dienes or diazo compounds to generate the Diels‚ÄìAlder or diazoalkane 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition products, respectively. Stable small- ring cycloalkynes have subsequently been isolated in complex with various transition metals such as nickel, palladium and platinum. Despite long being considered to be chemical curiosities with limited synthetic applications, recent work has demonstrated the utility of strained cycloalkynes in both total synthesis of complex natural products and bioorthogonal chemistry. Angle strain Angle strain in cycloalkynes arises from the deformation of the R‚ÄìC‚â°C bond angle which must occur in order to accommodate the molecular geometry of rings containing less than ten carbons. The strain energies associated with cyclononyne (C9H14) and cyclooctyne (C8H12) are approximately 2.9 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol, respectively. This upwards trend in energy for the isolable constituents of this class is indicative of a rapid escalation of angle strain with an inverse correlation to ring size. Analysis by photoelectron spectroscopy has indicated that the alkyne bond in small cyclic systems is composed of two non-degenerate œÄ bonds ‚Äì a highly reactive strained bond perpendicular to a lower-energy œÄ bond. Cis-bending of the R‚ÄìC‚â°C bond angle results in the drastic lowering of the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, a phenomenon which accounts for the reactivity of strained cycloalkynes from the perspective of molecular orbital theory. Synthesis Initial efforts toward the synthesis of strained cycloalkynes showed that cycloalkynes could be generated via the elimination of hydrochloric acid from 1-chloro-cycloalkene in modest yield. The desired product could be obtained as a mixture with the corresponding allene as the major product. Further work in this area was aimed at developing milder reaction conditions and generating more robust yields. To circumvent the generation of the undesired allene, the Kobayashi method for aryne generation was adapted for the synthesis of cycloalkynes. More recently, a superior method for generating strained cycloalkynes was developed by Fujita. It involves base induced Œ≤-elimination of vinyl iodonium salts. The vinyl iodonium proved to be a particularly useful synthetic precursor to strained cycloalkynes due to its high reactivity which arises from the strong electron withdrawing ability of the positively charged iodine species as well as the leaving group ability of the iodonium. In addition to the elimination-type pathways described, cycloalkynes can also be obtained through the oxidation of cyclic bis-hydrazones with mercury oxide as well as through the thermal decomposition of selenadiazole. Reactions Strained cycloalkynes are able to undergo all addition reactions typical to open chain alkynes. Due to the activated nature of the cyclic carbon‚Äìcarbon triple bond, many alkyne addition-type reactions such as the Diels‚ÄìAlder, 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions and halogenation may be performed using very mild conditions and in the absence of the catalysts frequently required to accelerate the transformation in a non-cyclic system. In addition to alkyne reactivity, cycloalkynes are able to undergo a number of unique, synthetically useful transformations. Cyclohexyne ring insertion One particularly intriguing mode of reactivity is the ring insertion of cyclohexyne into cyclic ketones. The reaction is initiated by the alkoxide-mediated generation of the reactive cycloalkyne species in situ, followed by the Œ±-deprotonation of the ketone to yield the corresponding enolate. The two compounds then undergo a formal [2+2]-photocycloaddition to yield a highly unstable cyclobutanolate intermediate which readily decomposes to the enone product. This reaction was utilized as the key step in Carreira's total synthesis of guanacastapenes O and N. It allowed for the expedient construction of the 5-7-6 ring system and provided useful synthetic handles for subsequent functionalization. Copper- free click reaction with cyclooctyne Cyclooctyne, the smallest isolable cycloalkyne, is able to undergo azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition under mild, physiological conditions in the absence of a copper(I) catalyst due to strain. This reaction has found widespread application as a bioorthogonal transformation for live cell imaging. Although the mild, copper-catalyzed variant of the reaction, CuAAC (copper-catalyzed azide‚Äìalkyne cycloaddition) with linear alkynes had been known, development of the copper-free reaction was significant in that it provided facile reactivity while eliminating the need for a toxic metal catalyst.

Gameplay Pitt (and Patti) must walk around the mazes, collecting items and avoiding enemies (which include the Heitai from Toy Pop along with the Pookas and Fygars from Dig Dug); however, they have the power to drop their Tinker Balls, which are both invulnerable to the enemies, and move around by pressing the Line button, therefore creating a line between them and their balls. Releasing the button makes their balls come back to them; the enemies are killed by having the balls slam into them. There are also pieces of popcorn which can be picked up around the mazes - and pressing the Popcorn button, Pitt and Patti can throw them at the enemies, and they shall bounce off the walls until they hit one (or evaporate if they have not done so by the end of the stage). Killing all enemies in a maze advances the player to the next stage; however, in the event of one enemy remaining, he will make for the nearest corner of the maze, say \\"Bye-bye!\\", and disappear (which shall detract from the \\"Pursuit Bonus\\" that the players will receive after they defeat Mao at the end of the game). Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Tinkle Pit on their April 15, 1994 issue as being the twenty- first most-successful table arcade game of the year. Retrospectively in 2015, Retro Gamer found the game to be strange yet charming, liking its level variety and simplistic mechanics. They blamed the genre's severe decline in popularity and its confinement to Japan as the reasons for its obscurity, and said that it would appeal to Namco fans for its amount of references and cameos to their other properties. Retro Gamer also viewed it as a good example of the transitioning video and arcade game scene of the decade, writing: \\"If you ever need reminding that the arcade market of the early Nineties was a weird, transitional scene, Tinkle Pit should serve well.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1993 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Crossover video games Category:Japan- exclusive video games Category:Maze games Category:Namco arcade games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Tinkle Pit"},{"id":"3760695","text":"Girish (also spelled as Gireesh) is a Hindu name which means \\"lord of the mountain \\" in Sanskrit (\\"giri\\" means rock/mountain and \\"isha\\" means shiva).

Schnabel was the son of pianist Artur Schnabel and operatic contralto and lieder singer Therese Behr and elder brother of the American actor Stefan Schnabel. An internationally celebrated teacher of the piano, his students include, among others, Leon Fleisher, Claude Frank, Richard Goode, Kwong-Kwong Ma, Stanislav Ioudenitch, Jon Nakamatsu, Murray Perahia, and Peter Serkin. Biography Karl Schnabel was born in Berlin on August 6, 1909. He began studying piano at the age of five. From 1922‚Äì1926 he studied at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik with Leonid Kreutzer and Paul Juon. He had a distinguished career as a master piano teacher and as an international performer. Schnabel left Berlin in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power, settling briefly at Lake Como; he emigrated to the United States in 1939, shortly before World War II. In the same year he married the American pianist Helen Fogel (1911‚Äì74),Not to be confused with Helen Fogel the jazz singer. with whom he played a large repertory of piano duets. They had a daughter, Ann. During World War II he interrupted his musical career to do war work as head of an electronic laboratory in Massachusetts. Schnabel's extra-musical interests included rock-climbing and photography. For several years, he was active producing motion pictures; in 1932, he was producer, director and cinematographer of a feature-length film based on a German fairy tale. As a young man, he participated in table tennis tournaments. During this time, Karl Ulrich Schnabel also maintained an elaborate miniature electric train set, complete with timetables. Family friend Paul Hindemith assisted in running the trains. Karl Ulrich Schnabel died in Danbury, Connecticut, on August 27, 2001. He was buried in the family plot in Schwyz, Switzerland, adjoining his parents and wife. Karl Ulrich Schnabel's papers are held at the Music Archive of the Akademie der K√ºnste in Berlin. His daughter Ann Schnabel Mottier currently manages the Schnabel Music Foundation, together with her husband Francois Mottier. Performance career=Solo Karl Ulrich Schnabel inherited from his parents an approach that united dramatic intensity of expression with absolute fidelity to the printed text. He is remembered for his imaginative interpretation of the Schubert song cycles. In 1926 he made his recital d√©but in Berlin, and subsequently gave recitals throughout Europe, North and South America, Russia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. He accompanied his mother at home and for concerts and recordings. Beginning at an early age he played for her voice lessons and coached her students. Schnabel made many recordings, solo and four-hand, for HMV, EMI, Philips, Musical Heritage Society, Sheffield, and TownHall, among others. He was the author of the well-known book Modern Technique of the Pedal (1950). He also published editions of compositions by Schubert and Weber. Piano duos Schnabel dedicated himself passionately to the revival of the largely neglected music for piano four hands, recording music by Schubert, Mozart, and Schumann, among others. Four-hand performance, Schnabel remarked, was an entirely different enterprise than solo performance: \\"Four-hand playing is a complex art that requires enormous time and patience. You are half of a whole rather than a whole in yourself. The four-hand repertory possesses qualities of chamber music, symphonic music, and virtuoso music -- sometimes all in the same piece.\\" Karl Ulrich Schnabel started duo performances and recordings with his father as partner. Some of these early performances are memorialized on record. The two switched Primo and Secondo parts, and made a pact never to reveal who played which part on the recordings. In 1939, he and his wife, American pianist Helen Fogel, founded the Piano Duo Schnabel, which performed concertos for two pianos and orchestra as well as recitals for one piano, four hands. In 1956, the duo participated at the Holland Festival in five performances with orchestra, and in 1972 they performed at the Edinburgh Festival. Reviews of the ensemble demonstrate that the Schnabels mastered the challenges of four- hand playing with skill and passion: \\"The four hand piano concert [...] came closer to perfection than any recital we have heard this year [...] They achieved a sheer transparency of sound, at once the most important and the most difficult requisite of four-hand piano music. It is incredibly difficult for two people to play a piece on one piano and be exactly together in timing, phrasing, and expression, yet the Schnabels were beautifully together and made of every note a work of art.\\" Five years after his wife‚Äôs death, in 1979, Karl Ulrich Schnabel formed a new duo with the Canadian pianist Joan Rowland. This duo, as well, was regularly praised for what the Washington Post deemed its \\"combination of spirit and jaunty elegance.\\" Karl Ulrich Schnabel as a teacher Karl Ulrich Schnabel is best known today as an internationally celebrated teacher of the piano. He began teaching at the age of 13 as his father's assistant. In 1940, he became head of all the instrumental departments at New York City‚Äôs Dalcroze School. Beginning in 1947, he resumed a family tradition: annual international summer master courses at Lake Como, Italy. In addition, he taught master courses in England, Scotland, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, Israel, Brazil, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and all over the United States, including at the Ravinia Festival. He became a faculty member at the Manhattan School of Music in 1985, and remained there until his retirement in 2000. Beginning in the early 1960s he taught numerous master classes throughout the world. Pianists who have played in Schnabel's master classes include Murray Perahia, Richard Goode, Wyung Whon Chung, Ursula Oppens and George Watson. His former students include Leon Fleisher, Claude Frank, and Peter Serkin. Edward Turgeon and Anne Louise- Turgeon, winners of the Murray Dranoff International Two Piano Competition, studied with Karl Ulrich Schnabel, as did Van Cliburn competition winners Stanislav Ioudenitch (2001) and Jon Nakamatsu (1997). Schnabel's passion for teaching led him to theorize extensively about how to achieve the correct relationship between piano technique and musical expression--the former \\"was always to remain in the service of the spirit of the music.\\" He emphasized a technique that required \\"arm participation\\": the pianist should use wrists and arms as well as fingers. He paid scrupulous attention to the subtle yet meaningful effects achieved through pedaling, setting these down in the book Modern Technique of the Pedal (1950). This volume has been translated from the original English into Italian, Korean, Chinese, and other languages. He even developed techniques to crescendo on a note and to achieve vibrato, which he explains on camera in the film Con Brio. Karl Ulrich Schnabel: Master Teacher of Piano (2001). Schnabel's teaching was characterized by a fine attention to emotion. Most pianists, he believed, played using just three or four emotions. But music demanded more than that: \\"To be really interesting, you must play with all the emotions.\\" He asked his students to make lists of all the emotions they could think of. One of his students came up with a list of over five hundred emotions, and \\"her playing was never dull again.\\" He also had a flair for imagery, describing the grotesque of Schumann's Fantasie as \\"a whole army of three-legged trolls advancing\\" and the turbulence of Chopin's Fantaisie as \\"Poseidon stirring up the waves with his big fork.\\" Such vivid language features prominently in English author Richard Rhodes's new book The Teaching of Karl Ulrich Schnabel, in which Rhodes, a long-time amateur student of Schnabel's, discusses Schnabel's comments on works by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Schubert, and Schumann.

The species is found on continental Australia and its offshore islands, including Tasmania. The species was originally split in 1999 by Schodde and Mason, and as the original collection by Gmelin was from Norfolk Island, this retained the name of multicolor, and is now known as the Norfolk robin. Taxonomy There are three recognised subspecies of Petroica boodang: the nominate subspecies P.b.boodang is found in mainland southeastern Australia; P.b.leggii is found in Tasmania and Flinders Island in the Bass Strait; and P.b.campbelli occurs in southwestern Western Australia.Gill, F. and D. Donsker, eds. (2020). IOC World Bird List (v 10.1). Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1. http://www.worldbirdnames.org/ Description Like the rest of the Australasian robins, the scarlet robins are stocky passerines with large heads. They range in size from 12 to 13.5 cm in length and weigh between 12 and 14 g. The plumage is sexually dimorphic. The males have black heads, backs and tails, black and white wings, a scarlet red breast, and white belly, forehead and rump. The female matches the male in pattern, but is duller, with brown plumage instead of black, a much more washed-out red on the breast, and a buff belly. Juvenile birds resemble the female without the reddish wash on the breast. Distribution, movements and habitat The scarlet robin is endemic to Australia, where it is found near the coast from southern Queensland to central South Australia, Tasmania and southwest Western Australia. The species is mostly sedentary over its range, but some mainland populations undergo small local movements in the autumn and winter, either to more open habitats or to lower elevations.Boles, W (2007) \\"Family Petroicidae (Australasian Robins)\\" in del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. and Christie D. (editors). (2007). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 12: Picathartes to Tits and Chickadees. Lynx Editions. pp. 482‚Äì483 The scarlet robin is most commonly found in eucalyptus woodland and forest, from sea level to 1000 m, particularly the more open habitats with grassy and shrubby understories. During the winter, more open environments, including urban habitats, are frequented. Behaviour The scarlet robin feeds on arthropods, such as insects and spiders. It adjusts its foraging behaviour seasonally, feeding mostly on the ground during the winter, but during the summer and spring prey is more commonly snatched from bark and foliage. Breeding biology The scarlet robin is a territorial and monogamous species, and defends its nesting territories both from others of the same species and from pairs of the related flame robin. Territories are established and breeding commences before the migratory flame robin arrives in its range (where the two co-occur). Both the male and the female participate in selecting the nesting site, but only the female constructs the nest, a task which takes four to ten days. The clutch size is between one and four eggs, with three being the average. The eggs are grey, green or pale blue, and marked with brown to olive-brown splotches and spots, usually concentrated around the large end. Only the females incubate the eggs, and the males feed the females on the nest. The chicks hatch after 14 to 18 days. At first, they are brooded by the female and fed by the male; when brooding ends, they are fed by both parents. Nesting success is generally low, between 8 and 40%. Scarlet robin nests are raided by snakes, and they are victims of brood parasitism by various species of cuckoo.

J. Walser Jr. residence in the Chicago, United States, neighborhood of Austin was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for real estate developer Joseph Jacob Walser Jr. The cruciform two-story house is typical of Wright's Prairie School period. History Joseph J. and Grace Walser purchased the lot at 417 South Central Avenue (re-designated 42 North Central Avenue in 1909) in Austin, Chicago on February 20, 1903. Walser worked for his father, Jacob Walser, a real estate developer who focused on the Austin market. At the time, Central Avenue was undeveloped, despite its location near a Lake Street Elevated Railroad station. The Walser family grew up in a house one block to the north and Jacob still lived there.https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000185.pdf It is not known how the Walsers came in contact with architect Frank Lloyd Wright. As developers, the Walsers were more knowledgeable about local architectural trends and probably were aware of Wright's rising status. A permit for Walser's house was approved on May 22, 1903. The house cost $4,000 and was completed by the end of the year. It is not certain who was tasked with building the structure, as C. Iverson is listed on the permit but later sources attribute it to Elmer E. Andrews. After completion, the house appeared in \\"Plaster Houses and their Construction\\", an article in House Beautiful in September 1905. The house was also part of Wright's Wasmuth Portfolio. The Walsers lived in the house for seven years. In 1910, when the Walsers moved six blocks east, the house was sold to George Donnersberger. Since then, the house has had a dozen owners, although it has remained in the hands of the Teague family since 1970. The house was recognized by the City of Chicago as a Chicago Landmark on March 30, 1984 and recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 2013. Architecture The east (main) facade of the Walser House faces Central Avenue. Today, it is one of the few single-family homes in the neighborhood, as most of Central Avenue is now walk-ups and apartment buildings. The exterior of the house is mostly white stucco. A two-story living room and bedroom block dominated the main facade. Typical of the Prairie School, it has a low-pitched hipped roof with deep overhanging eaves. Along the second story, immediately under the roof-line, is a horizontal band of five square casement windows with dark wood frames. The first floor has a centered, large window assembly with a picture window flanked with narrow casement windows. Flanking the main section are one-story porches, recessed from the front of the house. These porches were enclosed some time after 1903. The main entrance is to the west of the southern porch; like many of Wright's designs, it is hidden from street view. An addition, one room deep, was constructed on the west some time after 1903. The garage in the rear of the property was built at or near the time of the house construction. The design of the house served as the basis for Wright's Barton House in Buffalo, New York.

He was a highly influential piano teacher at the Berlin Academy of Music (Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Musik), together with Egon Petri. Amongst Kreutzer's students were W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman, Hans-Erich Riebensahm, Vladimir Horbowski, Karl-Ulrich Schnabel, Franz Osborn, Boris Berlin, Ignace Strasfogel, Franz Reizenstein and Grete Sultan. Leonid Kreutzer also gave musically and technically demanding solo recitals, mostly dedicated to specific composers or themes. At some of these, notably in June 1925, he performed works of contemporaries or modern, avant-garde composers of his time or of the recent past such as C√©sar Franck, Claude Debussy, Paul Hindemith and Paul Juon.

Although inlay can be done on any part of a guitar, it is most commonly found on the fretboard, headstock‚Äîtypically the manufacturer's logo‚Äîand around the sound hole of acoustic guitars. Only the positional markers on the fretboard or side of neck and the rosette around the sound hole serve any function other than decoration (the rosette serves as reinforcement). Nacre (\\"mother of pearl\\"), plastic and wood are the materials most often used as inlay. Some very limited edition high-end or custom-made guitars have artistic inlay designs that span the entire front (or even the back) of the guitar. These designs use a variety of different materials and are created using techniques borrowed from furniture making. While these designs are often just very elaborate decorations, they are sometimes works of art that even depict a particular theme or a scene. Although these guitars are often constructed from the most exclusive materials, they are generally considered to be collector's items and not intended to be played. Large guitar manufacturers often issue these guitars to celebrate a significant historical milestone.  Fretboard  Side of the fretboard inlays: note the small dot that marks 3rd fret Some popular fretboard inlays include rhombuses, parallelograms, isosceles trapezoids, shark fins and rectangles. Circular markers are the easiest and least expensive to produce, because drilling circular indentations and cutting circular inlays (from sheets or rods) require the least time and resources. They are typically of a color contrasting with the color of the fretboard: For example, whereas a luthier might use black for a light-colored fretboard such as maple, that same luthier would likely use white, silver, or mother-of-pearl for a fretboard made of a darker wood such as rosewood or ebony. Many manufacturers use a distinct shape for their fret markers to create a brand identity set themselves apart from competitors. Gibson uses isosceles trapezoids while Fender uses dots, but others include lightning bolts, letters and numbers. Smaller dots are also usually inlaid into the upper edge of the fretboard or the neck so as to be more visible to the player who views the instrument from the side. LEDs or optical fiber can be employed to illuminate the markers. This is mostly employed by players who perform in front of live audiences where the lighting is either insufficient or constantly changing. Image:Ibanez440rs6.jpgDots (used by Fender, Gibson and on most guitars) Image:Fretboard trapezoids.jpgIsosceles trapezoids (Gibson-style) Image:Prs birds.jpgBirds (PRS) Image:C1-classic-inlay.pngIntricate Vine Image:Inlay_-_Copy.jpgMorning Glory Flower pot Image:Fretboard_girl.jpgWomen in sexually suggestive poses  Schemes  100px On guitars, there are two popular fretboard inlay schemes: * The most popular (1) involves single inlays on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, double inlays on the 12th, single inlays on the 15th, 17th, 19th, and 21st, and if present, double inlays on the 24th. Advantages of such scheme include its symmetry about the 12th fret and symmetry of every half (0‚Äì12 and 12‚Äì24) about the 7th and 19th frets. However, playing these frets, for example, on the E string would yield the notes E, G, A, B, C# that barely make a complete musical mode by themselves. *: ** Resonator Guitars usually have inlays like the first scheme shown above but with a single inlay on the 12th, and double inlays on the 15th. *: * A less popular scheme (2) involves inlays on 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 12th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 22nd and 24th frets. Playing these frets on the E string yields the notes E, G, A, B, D that fit perfectly into the E minor pentatonic scale. Such a scheme is very close to the coloring of a piano's keys and is of some use on classical guitars. Some guitars like the Gibson Les Paul Custom will also have a single inlay on the 1st fret, then follow one of the above schemes.  Headstock, neck and pickguard  Typical headstock inlay Beyond the fretboard inlay, the headstock and sound hole are also commonly inlaid. The manufacturer's logo is commonly inlaid into the headstock and pickguard, if present. Sometimes a small design such as a bird or other character or an abstract shape also accompanies the logo. The sound hole designs found on acoustic guitars vary from simple concentric circles to delicate fretwork. Many high-end guitars have more elaborate decorative inlay schemes. Often the edges of the guitar around the neck and body and down the middle of the back are inlaid. Skunk stripe inlay Because some electric guitars (like the Fender Telecaster and Stratocaster) do not have a separate fretboard under which they can fit a truss rod, they fit it in the back of the neck and cover it with a strip of dark wood. This has popularly become known as a \\"skunk stripe,\\" and while it is not inlay, some makers use inlay to simulate it.  Sound hole  Martin guitar The edge of the soundboard around the sound hole of an acoustic guitar is almost always decorated with a rosette inlay. Main body One of Jerry Garcia's guitars, named \\"Rosebud.\\" Note the inlay work on the fret board and the dancing skeleton inlay work on the guitar's main body. Many guitars also have inlays on the main guitar body itself, often for decorative purposes.  Binding  Close examination of this guitar's body shows intricate multi-layered bindings (white-black-white)) Binding on acoustic guitars serve to protect the edges of the wood from impact and, particularly where end grain would be exposed, moisture damage. After the back, front and sides are joined a small ledge is cut out on the edge which is then inlaid before finishing the guitar. On solid-body electric guitars it serves only a cosmetic purpose. Fretboards are sometimes also \\"bound\\".  Purfling  Purfling is similar to binding, but differs in that it is offset a small distance from the edge surface. It is typically found around the edges of the front, back and sound holes of violins. Purfling helps prevent cracks at the edge from extending deeper into the wood.

The squadron is based at Joint Base McGuire‚ÄìDix‚ÄìLakehurst, NJ and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 49 (MAG-49) and the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW). Due to re- organization within Marine aviation, the squadron relocated to Joint Base MDL on July 1, 2016. History=Early years The squadron was originally established in September 1958 as Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron 773 (HMR-773) at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan and assigned to the Marine Air Reserve Training Command.\\"Lineage of Marine Attack Helicopter Squadron 773\\", HQMC 1990 They operated the Piasecki HUP-2 Retriever which were shared with the Naval Reserve. On April 1, 1962, the squadron was redesignated Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 773 (HMM-773). Four months later August 31 the squadron was deactivated. On April 15, 1968, HMM-773 was reactivated at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos and assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 46 of the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing. The squadron's personnel and aircraft, HUS-1 Sea Horses, came from sister squadron HMM-764. HMM-773's existence was short-lived; the squadron deactivated in September 1969. On September 1, 1971, Marine Attack Helicopter Squadron 773 (HMA-773) was stood up at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The squadron was assigned AH-1G Cobras, many of which had seen action with Marine squadrons in Vietnam. HMA-773 relocated to NAS Atlanta, Georgia during June 1976, absorbing the personnel of HML-765 which had just been deactivated. In late 1978, HMA-773 transitioned to the twin-engine AH-1J Sea Cobra which they operated for the next fourteen years. Bell AH-1G Cobra of HMA-773 squadron at NAS Atlanta in 1976 In November 1990, HMA-773 was the first reserve helicopter squadron to be activated and deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. While embarked aboard the USS New Orleans and USS Tripoli, the squadron distinguished itself with minesweeping escort and combat missions during the war. In recognition of their exemplary performance during combat HMA-773 received the Navy Unit Commendation. In the fall of 1992, the squadron received eight, state of the art AH-1W SuperCobras. In November 1993, HMA-773 began receiving UH-1Ns and personnel from other disestablished units. In October 1994, HMA-773 reorganized and re-equipped with the addition of the UH-1N utility helicopter, pilots, and personnel from HML-776, NAS Glenview, Illinois. Having re-designated as a Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 773, the squadron now mirrored the active-duty HMLA structure and enabled rapid total force integration for current and future combat and contingency operations. Since reorganizing, the \\"Red Dogs\\" of HMLA-773 have deployed on numerous counter-narcotics operations throughout the United States, the Caribbean, and the West Indies. In May 1995 the Squadron deployed to the island nation of Antigua for the first in a series of \\"Weed eater\\" marijuana destruction missions. They have further developed their eradication tactics on the islands of St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, and Nassau, Bahamas. HMLA-773 counter-narcotics missions in the United States have included joint operations with the Army, Coast Guard and several US Law Enforcement Agencies in Kingsville, Texas, El Paso, Texas, Naco, Arizona, Palm Beach, Florida, and El Centro, California. In the space of two years, the Red Dogs aided in the destruction of over $20 billion worth of illegal narcotics. HMLA 773 Cobras in Afghanistan In 2009, HMLA-773(-), HMLA-773 Det A and HMLA-773 Det B, separated to three locations yet come together to form one complete HMLA squadron that was capable of fulfilling any assigned HMLA mission in the Marine Corps. The current squadron organization is structured to maintain 1/3 of the squadron at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia 1/3 of the squadron at NAS Belle Chasse, LA (Det A) and 1/3 of the squadron at McGuire Dix Lakehurst Joint Forces Base, NJ (Det B). Currently, HMLA-773 Red Dogs are the largest HMLA squadron in the Marine Corps both in terms of personnel and aircraft. Global War on Terror Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, HMLA-773 prepared for participation in the Global War on Terror. The squadron activated in October 2003 and deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan, for further deployment along the international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since Oct 03, the Red Dogs have been flying combat missions in support of Combined Joint Task Force 180 and Combined Joint Task Force 76. In addition, the Red Dogs have instituted Operation Red Dog, in which the Marines and Sailors of the unit gather school supplies and other humanitarian items and distribute them to the local population. The squadron was the subject of exclusive documentaries for the Military Channel and ABC Nightline in Afghanistan during its deployment there. This film, \\"Task Force Red Dog\\" captured the squadron at war in a way that no other documentaries had done on helicopters in recent memory. Filmmakers Richard Mackenzie and William Skinner spent six months with the Marines of HMLA-773 at the front line in Afghanistan. After 18 months of continuous combat operations in Afghanistan, the squadron deployed to Camp Pendleton, CA in support of Revised Combined Arms Exercise (RCAX) to assist in the preparation of ground forces for duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. During this time, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the home to many of the Marines of HMLA-773. The squadron was one of the first military units to arrive in the city for rescue and relief operations. Beginning in October 2005, the reserve Marines of HMLA-773 began to demobilize and return to civilian life. And in February 2006, HMLA-773 returned to the status of drilling reserve unit. In September 2007, HMLA-773 replaced HMLA-269 in Al Asad Air Base in Iraq for a 6 to 7-month deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On July 30, 2008, a ground breaking ceremony was held at Robins Air Force Base for the hangar that is being constructed for HMLA-773. The hangar was completed in early 2010 and the squadron officially moved on July 1, 2010 during a change of command ceremony.

Gekic is a citizen of the United States, Serbia and Croatia. Early life Kemal Gekiƒá was born in Split, Croatia, to a Croatian mother (a descendant of the old notable family Buj from Split) and a Bosniak father. The maternal side of his family was extremely musical, and his father, an orthopedic surgeon, displayed a lifelong passion for music. Gekic displayed his musical gift extremely early even by the usual child prodigy standards - by picking up melodies by ear and accurately playing them on the piano at the age of one-and-half. Kemal received most of his early training from his maternal aunt, Prof. Lorenza Baturina, at the Music School \\"J.Hatze\\" in Split. He entered the class of Prof. Jokuthon Mihailoviƒá (a graduate of Moscow Conservatory) at the Art Academy of the University of Novi Sad, Serbia at age 16, earning his bachelor's degree in 1982 with the highest mark ever granted a diploma exam recital, after which he was immediately given a faculty appointment by the piano department, which he eventually directed until 1999. Education and performances During his studies Gekic won prizes at many international piano competitions (F.Liszt in Parma, Italy, Viana Da Motta in Lisbon, Portugal), but it was after he earned his master's degree in 1985 -the year of his appearance at the Chopin Competition in Warsaw, Poland, that marked a turning point in his career. He began receiving invitations to perform abroad, including several from the Chopin Society of Hannover, Germany which had awarded him a special prize for best sonata performance at the competition. A recording of his Warsaw performances sold 60,000 copies in Germany and 80,000 copies in Japan. Upon hearing these live performances the producers of JVC VICTOR from Japan signed an exclusive contract with Gekic (1988), which resulted in a series of prominent albums featuring solo and orchestral compositions by Mozart, Chopin, Liszt, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. This also led to his longtime association with Japan, where he became a pianistic idol whose numerous concerts are frequently televised on the national television (NHK) and also regularly recorded live by The Kemal Gekic Society and supported by the Kemal Gekic Fan Club of Japan. In the years following the 1985 Chopin Competition, in addition to extensive concert activity in Germany,Switzerland, France,Spain,Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Brazil, Guatemala, Venezuela, Bolivia, the US, Canada, and of course Yugoslavia, he completed tours of the USSR, Japan, South Korea,Taiwan, Thailand,Egypt and Kuwait. Since that time, Kemal Gekic has performed a great number of solo concerts and has played with many orchestras such as Warsaw Philharmonic, Royal Philharmonic of London, Japan Philharmonic Symphony, Leipzig Gewandhaus Symphony, Czech National Symphony Orchestra and others.

He is the author of 16 books, most notable of which is the memoir, Report from Engine Co. 82, a chronicle of his career as a firefighter with the New York City Fire Department in a South Bronx firehouse from the late 1960s and into the 1970s.Amazon: report From Engine Co. 82 Smith served for 18 years as a New York City firefighter,New York State Writers Institute: Dennis Smith from 1963 to 1981, and is the most well-known advocate for firefighters in the United States. After 9/11, he chronicled the 57 days he spent in rescue and recovery operations at the World Trade Center collapse in a bestselling book, Report from Ground Zero.https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/books/best-sellers- april-7-2002.html Early life and career According to his autobiography, Dennis Smith is of Irish ancestry and grew up in a tenement on the East Side of Manhattan. In 1963, Smith took the New York City Civil Service Test and became a firefighter in the New York City Fire Department. He was first assigned to Engine Company 292, a fire company located in Queens. Three years later, in 1966, Smith transferred to the busiest fire company in the city, and perhaps the world at the time, Engine Company 82, located in the South Bronx. In the mid-1970s, shortly after his first book was published, Smith transferred to Ladder Company 66 in the North Bronx. During the duration of his career, Smith lived with his family in the Orange County suburb of Washingtonville, New York, before moving to East 84th Street in New York City. Firehouse magazine In 1976, Smith founded Firehouse magazine. The magazine became the journal of record for the American fire service, and accorded Smith as its editor the opportunity to educate himself on most of the nation's emergency management concerns. He sold Firehouse in 1991, but continued as founding editor. At the time, Firehouse was a monthly trade magazine with a circulation of 120,000, and a readership of 700,000 within the community of firefighters. While serving as the editor and publisher of Firehouse, Smith also created the Firehouse Muster and Convention in Baltimore (now in Nashville). He was presented with the Legacy Award of Firehouse Magazine in 2016. Civic life Dennis Smith is a leader in New York City and national charitable organizations. He was the founding chairman of the New York Academy of Art. He was also the founding chairman of the New York City Fire Museum on Spring Street. From 1975 to 1995, he was president or chairman of the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club in the Southeast Bronx, where 9000 youngsters were members. He also served on the national board of advisors of Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and was elected to that institution's prestigious \\"Hall of Fame\\". His bronze bust resides in the lobby of the BGCA's Atlanta headquarters. Smith was a trustee of the New York Fire Foundation, a charity that supported special projects and needs of the fire commissioner. The foundation purchased pass alert devices for firefighters, computer services for firehouses, and was at the forefront of investigating the needs of firefighters and their departments. In 1991, he created the Foundation for the Health and Safety of American Firefighters with the royalties from one of his books. The foundation supported health and safety efforts through grants to leading organizations in the fire service. He was also a founding member who served on the board of the Congressional Fire Services Institute, an organization created by an Act of Congress. It provides emergency service management information and conclusions to the congress, and has been honored by visits from presidents George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, Homeland Security head Tom Ridge, and many congressional leaders. For eight years after 9/11, Smith served as a trustee of the New York Police & Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund, a charity that benefits the families of firefighters and police officers killed in the line of duty. Awards Smith's service to firefighters and his leadership in their causes have been recognized in numerous awards by the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the National Fire Academy, and the International Association of Fire Chiefs. The International Association of Fire Chiefs award cited Smith: Smith received a B.A. in English from New York University in 1970, and an M.A. in Communications from NYU in 1972.

There are medieval predecessors, such as the Burgundian Le jeu de la hache (\\"The Play of the Axe\\") of ca. 1400, but the history of the classical French school begins with the foundation of the Acad√©mie des Maistres en faits d‚Äôarmes de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie du Roy (also known as the √âcole fran√ßaise d‚ÄôEscrime) by Charles IX of France in December 1567. One master produced by this school was Henry de Saint-Didier, author of a 1573 treatise titled Traict√© contenant les secrets du premier livre (Treatise containing the secrets of the first book on the single sword), dedicated to Charles IX. Rapier treatises are known from the early seventeenth century, such as Fran√ßois Dancie's Discours des armes et methode pour bien tirer de l'esp√©e et poignard (c.1610) and L'esp√©e de combat (1623) and Andr√© Desbordes' Discours de la th√©orie et de la pratique de l'excellence des armes (1610), with both authors citing the Italian origins of their systems. Earlier, in 1597, the great traveller Seigneur de Villamont translated Girolamo Cavalcabo of Bologna‚Äôs treatise into French, along with a shorter piece by Paternostrier of Rome.foilalt=left Fencing in France was developed into a sport during the 17th century, with codification of rules and terminology and a system of teaching, by masters such as Le Perche du Coudray (1635, 1676, teacher of Cyrano de Bergerac), Besnard (1653, teacher of Descartes), Philibert de la Touche (1670) and L'Abbat of Toulouse (1690, 1696).L'Abbat The Art of Fencing (English translation, 1734) The modern foil was developed in France as a training technique in the middle of the 18th century; it provided practice of fast and elegant thrust fencing with a smaller and safer weapon than an actual dueling sword. Fencers blunted (or \\"foiled\\") its point by wrapping a foil around the blade or fastening a knob on the point (fleuret, \\"blossom\\"). German students took up that practice and developed the Pariser (\\"Parisian\\") thrusting small sword for their academic fencing bouts. By the 18th century, the French school had become the western European standard to the extent that Domenico Angelo, an Italian-born master teaching in England, published his L'√©cole des Armes in French in 1763. It was extremely successful and became a standard fencing manual over the following 50 years, throughout the Napoleonic period. Angelo's text was so influential that it was chosen to be included under the heading of \\"√âscrime\\" in Diderot's Encyclop√©die. The emergence of classical sports fencing in the 19th century was a direct continuation of the French tradition.

Although relatively low, Stoke Bishop's population has increased due to substantial infilling on the Smelting Works sports ground and The Grove which used to belong to Clifton High school. The population of Stoke Bishop varies throughout the year because of the influx of students to the large campus of Bristol University halls of residence situated on the edge of the suburb and the Downs during term time. Stoke Bishop is also the name of a council ward, which also includes Sneyd Park, The Downs open green space, much of the Avon Gorge. and a small area of Sea Mills along the River Trym. The suburb is concentrated around a small village hall and a row of shops on Druid Hill, with a number of small local businesses. The association with Druids arose from a megalithic monument, apparently the remains of a burial chamber, discovered in 1811 off what is now Druid Hill. Druid Stoke House, a Grade II listed building west of Druid Hill, dates from the late 18th or early 19th century.Images of England website The suburb of Druid Stoke was developed in the grounds of Druid Stoke House in the 1930s. Within Stoke Bishop there is a church, St Mary Magdalene (CofE); one primary school, Stoke Bishop C of E Primary, sometimes called Cedar Park, because of its location; and a village hall, which is used for a variety of activities from dog training to karate. The historic Stoke House and Park lie in Stoke Bishop. The house was built in 1669 as a family mansion for Sir Robert Cann, Member of Parliament, Mayor of Bristol and Merchant Venturer. Stoke House is a Grade II* listed building and is currently occupied by Trinity College, Bristol. Stoke Lodge Stoke Lodge, built in 1836, is a Grade II listed building and hosts the Stoke Bishop Adult Adult Education Centre. Alongside Stoke Lodge is a playing field, arboretum and a children's play park owned by Bristol City Council, the entire site has been held as education land since 1947. The playing fields are leased on a long term basis to Cotham School; these fields are the subject of a protracted legal dispute which reached the High Court in 2018 with the decision of the court being that Bristol City Council Public Rights of way committee \\"erred erroneously and unlawfully\\" when making its decision to register the playing fields as a Town/Village Green (TVG) in 2016. Following the TVG application being finally rejected in June 2018 by the Public Rights of Way committee (in light of the findings of the court), Cotham School erected new signage on the site and announced plans to fence the site to allow the school to use the playing field in a safe and secure manner, the fence was finally completed in March 2019. Since the failure of the previous TVG application a new application to register the land was made to the Commons Registration Authority in September 2018, this application is yet to be decided.

After studying together at Edinburgh College of Art, Pope and Guthrie completed MAs in London and began collaborating as artists in 1995, with their installation \\"Somewhere Over the TV\\" at the Collective Gallery in Edinburgh, followed by their live online travelogue \\"A Hypertext Journal\\" in March 1996. Somewhere has long-term collaborators including the composer Tim Olden and the technologist Dorian Moore. In 2007, Guthrie and Pope won the first Northern Art Prize. Works=The Floating Cinema In 2010/11, Somewhere was appointed as guest artists to programme and create content for the Floating Cinema, part of Up Projects' Portavilion series of temporary cultural spaces for London. Housed in a customised narrowboat designed by the architects Studio Weave, the Floating Cinema was an Olympic Development Authority commission taking place across summer 2011 on the canals in the East End of London. Guest speakers and performers aboard included the Olympic polemicist Iain Sinclair, the broadcaster Michael Smith (who premiered his first filmm as director, Drift Street, aboard) and the nature writer Richard Mabey. The project was recommissioned by the Legacy List (the charity leading the transformation of the former 2012 Olympic Park) to relaunch in 2013 with a new vessel designed by the London architects Duggan Morris. Jaywick Escapes The third feature documentary produced and directed by Guthrie and Pope was also shot by the directors, in 2010/11. This atmospheric and poignant film follows the stories of a handful of residents of the blighted seaside town of Jaywick in Essex, cited in government statistics as Britain's most deprived place. The film was premiered at the Sheffield Doc/Fest in summer 2012. What Will the Harvest Be? In 2008, Somewhere gained a major public commission from the London Borough of Newham to rejuvenate a barren site with Scheduled Ancient Monument Status close to the site of the 2012 Olympics in East London. The resulting proposal - What Will the Harvest Be? - became a major project to create an unregulated, publicly accessible harvest garden where anyone could grow and harvest vegetables and flowers. Working with an active residents' group, Friends of Abbey Gardens (FOAG), from spring 2009, the ruins of 19th-century housing and a medieval Cistercian gatehouse were stabilised and protected, and the plot was transformed with bespoke raised beds offering 1,000 linear metres of growing space. The garden design was influenced by historical research (e.g. the Plaistow Landgrabbers' Triangle Camp and the legacy of Cistercian gardens) and includes many specially designed elements which create a spectacular public space. What Will the Harvest Be? was initiated as a temporary site-specific project, and Somewhere also created a permanent design for the site. There are no plans to implement the permanent scheme. FOAG now manages the garden, holding diverse events for the community and visitors. Living with the Tudors The culmination of four years spent incognito within the UK historical re-enactment scene, \\"Living with the Tudors\\" is a documentary feature film shot entirely inside the 2007 Tudor (16th century) \\"re-creation\\" at Kentwell Hall in rural Suffolk. Among the 500 volunteers spending their summer holidays re-creating every aspect of 16th century English life, the film meets a core of loyal and protective re-enactors whose real-life stories form a fascinating counterpoint to their chosen Tudor roles. Shepherding through the thousands of paying visitors who keep Kentwell afloat is its owner, Patrick Phillips, a distantly paternal leader who describes the epic spectacles as his \\"game\\". Bata- ville: We are not afraid of the future In 2005, Somewhere co-produced Pope and Guthrie's first feature film, the unorthodox documentary travelogue Bata- ville: We are not afraid of the future, which was selected for the 2005 Edinburgh International Film Festival and has since become something of a cult success. The film follows a group of former Bata Shoes factory workers travelling from the UK to Zlin in the Czech Republic on a free coach trip hosted by the artists. The film sees them visit the origins of the global shoe empire built up by the early 20th century Czech entrepreneur Tomas Bata, in search of what his maxim \\"We are not afraid of the future\\" can mean in a changing Europe. The film originated in a commission by the agency Commissions East and the project has since become a benchmark for the contemporary public art genre. Bata-ville has been shown in many festivals and art venues, including at Tate Britain, SXSW Festival (Austin, Texas) 2006 and the Zlin Film Festival 2006. TV swansong In 2002, Somewhere produced the innovative media art project \\"TV swansong\\", the first live UK-based webcast of artists' projects commissioned specifically for the World-Wide Web, which took as its subject the demise of television in the age of convergent media. Featured artists were Graham Fagen, Jordan Baseman, Jessica Voorsanger, Zoe Walker and Neil Bromwich, Rory Hamilton and Jon Rogers, Chris Helson, Giorgio Sadotti. /broadcast/ (29 pilgrims, 29 tales) In 1999, Pope and Guthrie organised a contemporary version of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which was 1999's Tate Modern (Bankside) Annual Event. For this event, they chose 29 people to act as pilgrims and, on 11 September, they broadcast the pilgrims'stales live in Borough Market in Southwark, as well as webcasting them from this site onto the Internet. The website is now a record of the day's events, containing all the pilgrims' tales and prologues. The website contains an index, \\"The order of the day\\" and there a link to each pilgrim's home page, with details of the journeys they made to their chosen destinations within the project's 24-hour period. The contributors tales were as follows: The Fisherman's Tale, The Poet's Tale, The Artist's Tale, Interlude, The Management Consultant's Tale, The Tarot Reader's Tale, The Parishioner's Tale, The Scientist's Tale, Interlude, The Van Driver's Tale, The Analysand's Tale, The Friend's Tale, The Punter's Tale, The Counsellor's Tale, The Nun's Tale, The Fiddle Maker's Tale, The Phototherapist's Tale, The Writer's Tale, Interlude, The Scholar's Tale, The Diver's Tale, The Environmental Manager's Tale, Interlude, The Passenger's Tale, The Shopper's Tale and The Dilettante's Tale.

It is sometimes given the anglicised spelling Trevine, particularly on older maps, although the official name is Trefin in both English and Welsh. Trefin's name comes from the Welsh Trefaen meaning 'village on the rock outcrop'. The rock outcrop can be seen in many places around Trefin, especially its centre. The village lies within the parish and community of Llanrhian. History The Mill at Aberfelin Although small, Trefin is an historical village. It is linked to the Archdruid Crwys, who was born in Craig Cefn Parc, Glamorganshire, and the historic mill at Aberfelin is the subject of his poem Melin Trefin. The mill was in use for around 500 years and was used by the villagers of Trefin and surrounding areas. Wheat was milled to produce flour for bread and barley was ground into winter feed for livestock. By the 1900s cheap grain was being imported from overseas and milled in larger mills in towns and cities and Trefin Mill closed in 1918. The mill stones remain in the ruins of the roofless mill. Community Trefin is an area of outstanding beauty, surrounded by the Irish Sea and on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, between Porthgain and Abercastle. It is on the route of the Strumble Shuttle bus service, part of the Pembrokeshire Greenways public transport service. Trefin lies within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, the only coastal area included in the National parks of the United Kingdom. Trefin is a small village of around 130 people, and houses a weaving centre, The Mill cafe, two chapels (both now closed), a pub The Ship Inn, a hostel 'Old School Hostel' as well as holiday accommodation.

Built in 1892, it is one of the few surviving residential works of Louis Sullivan, and features major contributions by Frank Lloyd Wright, who was then working as a draftsman in the Adler & Sullivan architecture firm. The house is owned and operated as a museum and organization headquarters by The Society of Architectural Historians (SAH). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The Charnley Residence is located in Chicago's Gold Coast north of the commercial downtown, at the southeast corner of North Astor Street and East Schiller Street. It is three stories in height, with a raised basement of stone and 2-1/2 stories of largely austere brickwork. The facade is divided into three parts, the center portion housing the main entrance in a stone surround flanked by paired sash windows. Above it is a projecting ornate wooden balcony that obscures the fact that the wall behind it is recessed. The flanking sections each have single sash windows set on large expanses of brick, in deep rectangular openings with splayed soldier brick lintels. The third level is separated from the lower levels by a stone stringcourse, and has two deeply recessed square windows in each section. The interior of the house is a marked contrast to its relatively plain exterior. It has high-quality woodwork throughout, with builtin bookcases featuring doors with glass of varying shapes and sizes. The main library features a fireplace of African rose marble, and the dining room has extensive use of mahogany, a favorite wood of Louis Sullivan's. History The house was completed in 1892 for Charnley, a Chicago lumberman who lived in the house with his family for about a decade. It is a distinctive and original design of Sullivan's, in which a modern aesthetic was brought to an essentially Classical symmetrical form. It is unclear exactly how much influence Wright had on the design, but it is clear that it is found in both interior and exterior features. The building was later owned by members of the Waller family, who invested in real estate. The house was purchased by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in 1986 and subsequently restored. Seymour Persky purchased the house in 1995 and donated it to the SAH who renamed the building to the Charnley‚ÄìPersky House to honor their benefactor.

It tells the story of a pandemic that shuts down London, and a group of three teenagers that survive the outbreak. The book takes an apocalyptic view and details the experiences of the three principal characters at the end of the year 1999, as the plague wipes out the population of London in the course of a few weeks. It was written during the Cold War and reflects many aspects of the fears of the time. The principal characters are Fran, her best friend Harriet, and a schoolmate, Shahid. The book has two sequels set 100 years later called Come Lucky April (also published as After the Plague) and Watchers at the Shrine, which did not receive as much praise as the first by some readers. Come Lucky April follows the story of the descendants of Fran and Harriet, Daniel and April. Daniel, Fran's great-grandson, travels to her home town to find her diary. There he discovers a feminist community founded by Fran's friend Harriet, who was sexually harassed in the original book.

The unit was established in 1982Monica Rikoll: Forsvarets spesialkommando feiret 50-√•rs-jubileum NRK, 1 September 2012, due to the increased risk of terrorist activity against Norwegian interests, including the oil platforms in the North Sea.\\"- VIKTIG √Ö BESKYTTE: Forsvarets spesialkommando (FSK) har jevnlig realistiske √∏velser i terror mot norske oljeplattformer i Nordsj√∏en\\" On 1 January 2014, the Norwegian Special Operation Forces (NORSOF), also known as Armed Forces' Special Forces, was established uniting the FSK and the Navy Special Operation Command () (MJK) under the one command in the Norwegian Armed Forces. In 2014, FSK established an all female unit Jegertroppen (Jeger Troop). Introduction Very little is known publicly about FSK, since the Norwegian government denied their existence and participation in any military operations for a long time. Some details have however emerged after FSK's participation in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The establishment of FSK was briefly mentioned in an article in the Norwegian newspaper, Aftenposten, in 1983. During a hijacking in Norway in 1985, it was reported that FSK operatives had been put on alert in their base at Trandum, but not requested to assist in any action. A proposal to disband the FSK in 1988, as a financial measure, was met with protests, especially from the oil industry and the military. The plan was shelved after much media attention. Aftenposten reported on the unit as a \\"special military command composed of highly trained operators from H√¶rens Jegerkommando at Trandum and Marinejegerkommandoen, in addition to other specialists. The first time FSK was publicly mentioned by a representative of the armed forces, was in connection with the hijacking of SAS Flight 347 at Gardermoen Airport in September 1993. The following year, the magazine Vi Menn published an article about the FSK. In 1990 the FSK was also mentioned in a research paper: \\"The Armed Forces' Special Command (FSK) is specially trained to be used in the event of terrorist attacks against oil installations - especially hijacking situations.\\" FSK's existence was only publicly acknowledged by the Norwegian Armed Forces for the first time in 1999, when a piece about the unit appeared in the Armed Forces Magazine Forsvarets Forum (The Defence Forum).\\"Daler ned i skjul\\", Forsvarets Forum. FSK cooperate with special operations forces from several other countries, including the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) of the United Kingdom, Delta Force, Navy SEALs/DEVGRU, and the 75th Ranger Regiment of the United States, and KSK and GSG-9 of Germany. History Forsvarets Spesialkommando can trace its roots back to the Second World War, when Norwegians served in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (NOR.I.C.1) of the British Special Operations Executive including the famous Operation Gunnerside raid of the heavy water plant at Rjukan. On 25 March 1962, the Army Parachute Ranger School () was created. The focus of this school initially was to provide parachute training for certain groups of personnel within the Norwegian Armed Forces, and eventually the Paratrooper Platoon () was established in 1965. Specially selected personnel from this platoon were assigned to Ranger Command 1 in the old mobilization army of the Cold War and were on standby in case of war. In 1971, the Army Parachute Ranger School changed its name to the Army Ranger School () (HJS) to emphasize the training of Army Rangers. The main focus over the next decade was long-range reconnaissance patrols (LRRP). Based on an increase in international terrorism and Norway's newly developed offshore oil services, the government decided in 1979 to establish a counter-terrorism capacity within the Norwegian Armed Forces. In 1982, a decision was finally made that this task be given to the Army Ranger School with Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK) established as part of the Army Ranger School. On 1 June 1984, the 38 man unit was operational following assistance from the British Special Air Service and Special Boat Service. From the mid-1990s there was an increasing focus on international operations. To show that the Army Ranger School now had an operative arm as well as the traditional training role, it changed its name to the Army Ranger Command () in 1997. The same year, HJK moved from Trandum to Rena, where the unit is based today. During the 2000s, HJK changed its name to FSK/HJK, to reflect the two units that make up the command (FSK being the operative wing and HJK being the training wing). In 2004, the unit commenced reporting directly to the Chief of the Army. In 2013, the FSK/HJK name was discontinued and the operative SOF-unit is simply known as FSK. Official FSK website Today FSK has gone from being a cadre and training-unit for paratroopers and the mobilization army, to being a professional unit with substantial experience, robustness, competency and capacity. The unit has been deployed internationally on several occasions and has received international recognition for its efforts. The unit has a considerable amount of support from Norway's political and military leaders. The Norwegian Parliament has decided that the Norwegian SOF are to be strengthened. FSK recruits, selects and trains paratroopers and SOF operators, and produces officers for the rest of the Norwegian Armed Forces. FSK is on both national and international standby for special operations and counter-terrorism operations (alongside Marinejegerkommandoen). In addition, FSK is the competency and training centre for all parachute and counter-terrorism training in the Norwegian Armed Forces. International operations=Kosovo FSK and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) cooperated in various ways during the Kosovo conflict.Hjalp vi forbryterne til makten? - Kultur - Dagbladet.no FSK, operating alongside the British SAS, was the first special operations force to enter Pristina.

In wartime, their tasks are mainly: * to gather intelligence * to localize and identify enemy supplies and activity * to carry out offensive operations against strategically important targets * to provide support for rescue missions of important personnel * to provide protection for personnel and departments Selection and training Currently anyone who has completed their military service with Norwegian Armed Forces can apply. The road to becoming an elite soldier of the FSK is long and hard. First, one must go through a general selection to separate out those who do not have physical and mental strength to start the special forces recruitment school. This selection lasts three days. A candidate must do 45 push-ups and 50 sit-ups in two minutes, 8 pull-ups, swim 400 meters in under 11 minutes, and march 30 kilometers carrying 25 kilograms in less than 4 hours and 50 minutes. It is emphasized that this is the bare minimum, and that candidates should ideally be able to do more than that. The female troop has lower standards, with one pull-up; 20 push-ups; 35 sit-ups in two minutes or less; 20 back extensions; swim 200 metres (660 ft), with no underwater phobia; and perform a 7-kilometre (4.3 mi) road run carrying 22 kilograms (49 lb) in 59 minutes. After passing the general selections, an applicant attends SOF selection. This selection lasts three weeks and comprises hard physical and mental exercises with little food and little sleep. Very few of those who enter the school get through. Following selection, the potential operator starts basic training (one year). This training involves all basic disciplines required to serve as a SOF operator. Not all who begin basic training get through. After training, one is eligible for operational service in FSK, including training in specialist roles, such as sniper, combat medic, forward air controller, etc. Further training is conducted in Norway or abroad at allied training facilities.

It consists of three distinct settlements, separated from each other by an open area of downland called Telscombe Tye. Telscombe village is a small village on the South Downs, six miles (10 km) south of Lewes. It includes the parish church, with origins dating back to the 10th century. The village has a population of fewer than 50 people. The parish retains its ancient boundaries, which reach from the village to the coast, and the major part of the population is in the two coastal settlements. At the eastern end of the parish, about 4500 people live at Telscombe Cliffs, developed in the 20th century effectively as an extension of the town of Peacehaven over the town boundary. At the western end, the remaining 2500 population forms part of the community of Saltdean, the remainder of Saltdean being within the city of Brighton and Hove. In 1929, thanks to the growth in population, Telscombe gained a parish council: in 1974 it became a town, with a mayor. The new civic centre in Telscombe Cliffs came into use in 2000. The Prime Meridian crosses the northeast corner of Telscombe parish. The town has a school, Telscombe Cliffs Primary. The parish includes part of the Brighton to Newhaven Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest. The cliffs are mainly of geological interest, containing many Santonian and Campanian fossils. The SSSI listing includes flora and fauna biological interest too. History The manor of Telscombe is recorded as early as the 10th century, when it was given by King Edgar to the minster of Hyde, and remained in those hands until the dissolution in 1538. The manor and village passed through many hands in the following centuries; in 1900 James Andrew Harman became Lord of the Manor, and in 1924 it was acquired by Charles Willam Neville (born Charles William Neville Ussher in 1881), the developer who had founded Peacehaven in 1916. The village was part of the Holmstrow hundred until the abolition of hundreds in the 19th century. Telscombe Village St. Laurence's Church Although the ancient village of Telscombe is located less than two miles (3 km) from the coast, there is no public road linking the village with the coastal part of the parish. The byway was closed to all traffic in 2015. The village is found at the end of a winding dead end road leaving the Lewes‚ÄîNewhaven road at Southease. Telscombe is a small cluster of buildings around a church dedicated to St Laurence. It is a 10th-century foundation with a 13th-century font, largely rebuilt and decorated in the 20th century. The manor house was for many years used as Judge's Lodgings, occupied when High Court judges were sitting at Lewes Crown Court. This practice was controversial because of the costs of providing and maintaining this accommodation, including the employment of butlers and other staff, and was phased out by the Labour government from 2001. The cost of the Telscombe lodgings was put at ¬£147,893. Telscombe Tye Telscombe Tye is an area of open land with the status of common, extending from Telscombe village to the coast. The Tye forms a natural break between the settlements of Saltdean and Telscombe Cliffs/Peacehaven, and marks the eastern end of a continuously built up area (Greater Brighton) from Shoreham in West Sussex. The Tye is contained within the South Downs National Park, and is one of the few places where the park boundary reaches the seafront. As designated common, the land was unenclosed and on a map dated 1811 is shown as \\"Sheep Down\\" on which local stockholders had grazing rights. One such landowner in the early 20th century was Ambrose Gorham. He managed a stud farm and trained racehorses, including the 1902 winner of the Grand National. On his death in 1933 he bequeathed his property in the village in trust to be administered by the Brighton Corporation, stating in the trust deed: At this time Neville, the developer of Peacehaven owned the Tye itself, while the trustees of Gorham's Gift owned the rights of common: a situation which led to frequent disputes. In January 1979 the land was registered as common under the Commons Registration Act, and in 1989 the Tye was put up for auction by the Neville family (Charles Neville had died in 1960) and purchased by Telscombe Town Council. Governance Telscombe Town Council consists of 13 elected councillors, five representing East Saltdean and eight from Telscombe Cliffs. Elections are held every four years and, as in neighbouring Peacehaven town council, are contested by candidates of the main political parties. The town is represented by three councillors on Lewes District Council. Telscombe and Peacehaven jointly form the Peacehaven & Telscombe Towns electoral division which elects two councillors to the East Sussex county council. Telscombe is in the Brighton Kemptown constituency for the UK Parliament.

These were constructed in the backyards of the communes, to further the Great Leap Forward's ideology of the rapid industrialization of China. People used every type of fuel they could obtain to power these furnaces, from coal to the wood of coffins. Where iron ore was unavailable, they melted any steel objects they could get procure, including utensils, household objects like chairs and doors, bicycles, and even farming equipment, the intended end product being steel girders. The result was not steel, but high-carbon pig iron, which needs to be decarburized to make steel. Not until 1959 did the Party realize that only large industrial smelting plants were making steel of any value. Almost all of the iron from the communes was practically useless. In regions where the steelmaking tradition had survived unbroken and the old skills of the ironmasters had not been forgotten, the pig iron was indeed further refined into steel, and steel production actually did increase. In regions that had no tradition of steelmaking, where the old ironmasters had been killed, or where there was no theoretical understanding of the blast- furnace process needed to refine pig iron, the results were unsatisfactory. At worst, the fuel used was high-sulfur coal, which produced pig iron that needed to be re-smelted and desulfurized before it could be refined into steel. Even worse, the tending of the furnaces denied peasants the time and opportunity to produce food, effectively starving many and directly contributing to the Great Chinese Famine.

Arthur Way, son of the Rev. William Way and his wife Matilda, n√©e Francis, was born at Dorking, England. He was educated at Kingswood School, Bath, and graduated M.A. at University of London. From 1870 to 1876 he was classical lecturer at Queen's College, Taunton, vice-master of Kingswood School, 1876 to 1881, and in 1882 became headmaster of Wesley College, Melbourne. He had already published his translation of the Odyssey of Homer, and while at Wesley brought out his translation of the Iliad. (See English translations of Homer#Way.) At Wesley he fostered the teaching of natural science, and also brought in the teaching of commercial principles for boys likely to pursue a business career, but the number of students went down during his period, largely because of the financial depression which began in 1889. He resigned in 1892 and spent most of the rest of his life in translating from the classics. The list of his translations in Miller's Australian Literature includes the Odyssey; the Iliad; works of Euripides, Aeschylus, and Sophocles; the Epodes of Horace; Vergil's Georgics; the Nibelungenlied; the Chanson de Roland; works of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus; the New Testament Biblical letters of Paul and Hebrews entitled, The Letters of St. Paul to Seven Churches and Three Friends with The Letter to the Hebrews; works of Aristophanes, Hesiod, Lucretius, and others. Way was also the author of Homer (1913), Greek through English (1926), and Sons of the Violet-Crowned, a Tale of Ancient Athens (1929). Way had been president of the Melbourne Shakespeare Society and a councillor of the Royal Society of Victoria. Way died at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, on 25 September 1930.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 10, 2002. The episode was written by Aaron Ehasz and directed by Peter Avanzino. Al Gore guest stars as his own preserved head in a jar, his second appearance in the series. The episode tackles the topic of global warming as the Planet Express crew is sent to retrieve Earth's yearly ice supply in order to keep the planet cool. When they are unable to retrieve the ice, the Earth is forced to search for other ways to solve their global warming problem. In 2003, the episode was nominated for an Environmental Media Award. Plot On Earth, the days are getting hotter and hotter. The crew, looking for an explanation, watch an old movie about global warming. The film explains a temporary solution for global warming was found by dropping a mountainous slab of ice into the ocean on a regular basis to cool it. The Planet Express crew is assigned the task of gathering a new slab of ice to drop in the ocean. The crew goes to Halley's Comet, but finds that it is out of ice. With no ice left, the world's top scientists are called to a conference in Kyoto, Japan. Ogden Wernstrom uses a giant mirror to deflect 40% of the sun's rays, but a stray asteroid causes it to reflect the rays into a highly destructive beam. Professor Farnsworth reveals that robots, with their high-pollution emissions, are the cause of the crisis. The scientists, led by Wernstrom, decide to destroy all the robots on Earth. Meanwhile, Bender is moved to tears after witnessing a news report on the migration of turtles due to the heat and decides to rescue one from Holland. When questioned by the crew Bender says he has many things in common with the turtle. He claims that both have a tough outer shell but a rich inner life. More importantly, he also confides the inability to get up if he falls directly on his back. Earth President Richard Nixon's head organizes a party for the unsuspecting robots on the remote Galapagos Islands, where he plans to destroy the entire robot population with an electromagnetic blast from an orbiting EMP cannon made from Wernstrom's mirror. Bender, who was at the meeting of scientists and thus knows of the plan, decides, for the sake of the turtles, that he will accept his fate and attend the party. At the party, Bender is overheard saying that all the robots are doomed, causing panic. Farnsworth arrives with Fry and Leela and delivers a solution to the robots; every last one needs to blast their exhaust vents at the same time, straight up in the sky, in order to push the Earth farther from the Sun, thus cooling the Earth and causing the EMP cannon to miss its target. During the panic Bender and the turtle are knocked onto their backs and cannot get up, leaving not enough exhaust to move the Earth. As Bender is lamenting his fate, the turtle rocks from side to side and rolls to its feet. Shocked and inspired, but not to be shown up, Bender does the same, allowing him to release his massive exhaust, just barely saving the robots from the EMP. Farnsworth receives a medal of pollution for his work, and the extra week caused by the new orbit of the Earth is declared Robot Party Week. Production The episode focuses on global warming in part because David X. Cohen's father had insisted upon it; however, Cohen jokes that his father was disappointed with the episode. Halley's Comet was originally going to be white and snowy in this episode, since that was what the staff's idea of a comet looked like; however, they later realized that, since the comet was \\"out of ice\\", it should be brown. The location chosen for the robot party was the Galapagos Islands because the writers thought that, if they were actually going to push the Earth out of orbit, they would need to be near the equator. Al Gore was unable to attend the table reads of the script, so Maurice LaMarche read his lines. He notes in the DVD commentary that Gore's daughter Kristin, who wrote for Futurama, was also at the table read, and he jokes that this was one of the highlights of his career. Additional voice roles in the episode include Tress MacNeille as Joan Rivers' preserved head in a jar and LaMarche as the headless body of Spiro Agnew. Billy West, who voices Nixon's head, says that his impression of Nixon is not meant to be an accurate impression but it intentionally plays up certain quirks and flaws. West also voices the C-3PO-esque robot which appears early in the Professor's flashback. He accomplished the voice effect by speaking into a coffee cup during the recording of the lines. Continuity *This is the second guest appearance by Al Gore who previously appeared in the episode \\"Anthology of Interest I\\". Cultural references * Al Gore's head makes reference to the book Earth in the Balance, written by Al Gore in 1992; the second, more popular book, entitled Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth, is a reference to the Harry Potter book series. Broadcast and reception Al Gore as depicted in the Futurama episode \\"Crimes of the Hot\\". This episode was nominated for an Environmental Media Award in the television episodic-comedy category in 2003, it lost to the King of the Hill episode \\"I Never Promised You An Organic Garden\\". The episode has been used to highlight the dangers of global warming, particularly the retro-style public service announcement shown to the Planet Express employees at the beginning of the episode. A short clip from the episode was later used in An Inconvenient Truth to humorously explain how global warming works. Gore's appearance on Futurama is considered to be a part of his \\"carefully choreographed\\" reemergence after his loss in the 2000 Presidential election. The appearance also allowed him to show a different side of himself rather than the \\"personified synonym for woodenness\\" he had previously been known for in order to promote his book Joined at the Heart. The episode received a \\"B\\" rating from Sci Fi Weekly noting that, while the episode was not one of the best in the series, it was still a solid effort and was \\"funny and irreverent\\". The reviewer praised the voicing in the episode, particularly Gore's performance, calling him \\"a stitch\\". He noted that there were many humorous moments in the episode, bur overall it was too \\"scattered\\". ReferencesExternal links Crimes of the Hot at The Infosphere.

It also had the judicial functions of interpreting and enforcing awards and hearing other criminal and civil cases relating to industrial relations law. The Court was declared invalid by the High Court of Australia in the Boilermakers' case,. and was replaced by two bodies: the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Commonwealth Industrial Court. History The Court was created in 1904 by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904,. an Act of the Parliament of Australia. The Court was initially less important than the various State industrial conciliation commissions, which had jurisdiction over all disputes which occurred within their respective states. The Court's workload was so low that it made only six awards in the first five years of its existence. Amendments in 1926 reformed the Court. The changes included replacing the office of President with that of Chief Judge alongside other judges, and ensuring all cases involving the basic or living wage would be heard by a full bench of the Court. The changes also allowed for the appointment of Conciliation Commissioners, with a role similar to mediators. Further changes were made to the Court in 1947 to increase the role of the Commissioners, leaving the judges to conduct the judicial work, and a select few matters of arbitration including the basic wage and the minimum wage for women. In 1956, the High Court of Australia in the Boilermakers' case held that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as a tribunal exercising the non-judicial power of arbitration, could not also exercise judicial power as a Chapter III Court under the Australian Constitution. The decision has come to stand for the important doctrine of the separation of powers in Australia. The decision effectively rendered the Court defunct. Following the decision, two new bodies were created to perform the function of the now-defunct Court. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was created in 1956 to carry out the non-judicial functions.. It was renamed the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1973,. the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in 1988,. Fair Work Australia in 2010,. and the Fair Work Commission in 2012.. The Commonwealth Industrial Court was created to exercise the Court's judicial powers. In 1973 the Industrial Court was renamed the Australian Industrial Court, and in 1977 its functions were transferred to the new Federal Court of Australia.. Notable decisions One of the Court's early awards was the landmark Harvester case (Ex Parte H.V. McKay of 1907), delivered by Justice H.B. Higgins, which introduced the concept of the living wage into Australian industrial relations. Within 25 years, the concept of a living wage had been extended to most of the Australian workforce, and influenced later decisions establishing certain types of paid leave, and equal pay for indigenous Australians and women. During the Great Depression, the Court reduced wages by 10%. The Court also decided cases setting the standard working week in Australia. In 1904, the standard working week was 48 hours. In 1930, the Court reduced the working week to 44 hours. In 1947, the Court reduced the working week to 40 hours in a case that took two years to hear.

Manson rode back and forth on the line until he located the factory. The structure was an exercise in concrete construction technique. It is one of the least decorative designs of Wright's career. Wright's original design for the factory included an elaborate scheme for an open court between side wings at the rear. The plans for the court were found at Taliesin but were never executed.

Minard was, among other things, noted for his representation of numerical data on geographic maps, especially his flow maps.  Early life  Minard was born in Dijon in the Saint Michel parish. He was the son of Pierre Etienne Minard and B√©nigne Boiteux. His father was a clerk of the court and an officer of the secondary school. Minard was baptized at Saint Michel on the day of his birth. From Posted by Edward Tufte. He was very bright and his father encouraged him to study at an early age. At age four he learned to read and write, and when he was six his father enrolled him in an elementary course in anatomy. He completed his fourth year of study at the secondary school at Dijon early, and then applied himself to studying Latin, literature, and physical and math sciences. At age 15 and a half, he was admitted to the prestigious √âcole Polytechnique, where he studied from 1796 to 1800. He subsequently studied civil engineering at √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es (ca. 1800‚Äî1803).  Work = Civil engineering  In September 1810 he was sent by the government to Antwerp and then almost immediately to the port of Flessingue. There, he solved a critical problem with a cofferdam that was leaking water faster than it could be removed. He solved the problem by using pumps driven by a steam engine, only the third time this solution had been applied to a project. He worked for many years as a civil engineer on the construction of dams, canals and bridge projects throughout Europe. On November 1, 1830, he was named superintendent of the School of Bridges and Roads, where he continued to serve through 1836. While there he was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honor. From 1839 he was inspector of the Corps of Bridges, and from 1846 inspector general and a permanent member of the Conseil g√©n√©ral des ponts et chauss√©es. He retired in 1851 at the mandatory retirement age of 70, after which he dedicated himself to private research, including most famously the creation of a comprehensive body of statistical maps.  Information graphics  Minard created 51 thematic maps during his lifetime and is considered \\"a cartographic pioneer in many respects\\".Arthur H. Robinson (1967), \\"The Thematic Maps of Charles Joseph Minard\\", Imago Mundi, Vol. 21, (1967), pp. 95‚Äì108 =Early works= Minard's earliest known diagram is from 1825, but he did not start regularly producing statistical graphics until the 1840s. During this period he became interested in studying passenger and freight traffic to aid in the design of railroads. He created bar charts in which the width of each bar represents the length of the corresponding railroad segment, and its height the number of passengers. Analysis of such graphs led Minard to conclude that passengers and freight traveling for short distances between intermediate stations (and not just end-to-end traffic) were of primary importance in designing rail lines. =Flow maps= Minard created his \\"revolutionary\\" first flow map in 1845 to inform the discussion about routing the rail line in the area between Dijon and Mulhouse. The map shows traffic on the pre-existing roads in the area. Two hundred copies of it were distributed to various stakeholders, and it dominated the debate among the deputies and engineers. In subsequent decades Minard created tens of flow maps, illustrating subjects such as French wine exports and coal imports, British coal exports, freight traffic on French rivers and railways, European cotton imports, and international migration flows. A comprehensive portfolio of his works is today kept at the √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es. =The map of Napoleon's Russian campaign= Minard is best known for his cartographic depiction of numerical data on a map of Napoleon's disastrous losses suffered during the Russian campaign of 1812 (in French, Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l'Arm√©e Fran√ßaise dans la campagne de Russie 1812‚Äì1813). The illustration depicts Napoleon's army departing the Polish- Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon's troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard's interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers. This type of band graph for illustration of flows was later called a Sankey diagram, although Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey used this visualisation 30 years later and only for thematic energy flow. Charles Minard's map of Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign of 1812. The graphic is notable for its representation in two dimensions of six types of data: the number of Napoleon's troops; distance; temperature; the latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates. The original description in French accompanying the map translated to English: A modern redrawing of the map, translated into English: degrees R√©aumur to degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius  Recognition  Eug√®ne Rouher painted by Alexandre Cabanel, ca. 1861. A map by Charles Joseph Minard is draped over the chair in the background. Minard's information graphics, many of which illustrated the flows of goods and people in transportation networks, were appreciated by public works officials during his lifetime. Eug√®ne Rouher, the secretary of agriculture, commerce, and public works in the government of Napoleon III, subscribed to Minard's prints, allowing him to publish ten thousand copies of maps on various subjects. Rouher also presented Minard's maps to Napoleon III and included one of them in the background of his portrait, exhibited at the 1861 Paris Salon. Modern information scientists say the 1869 map of Napoleon's Russian campaign may be the best statistical graphic ever drawn. French scientist, physiologist and chronophotographer √âtienne-Jules Marey praised \\"its brutal eloquence, which seems to defy the pen of the historian\\". Information designer Edward Tufte says it \\"may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn\\"Edward R. Tufte (2001).

It was released on August 24, 1999 by Bong Load Records in collaboration with Wax Tadpole Records, an independent record label that the band formed after being dropped by Reprise Records in 1997. L7 recorded the album as a trio formed by founding members Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner, and longtime drummer Demetra Plakas, following the departure of bassist Gail Greenwood. It was made with a low budget and produced by the band and their friend Brian Haught. Unlike previous L7 albums, Slap-Happy features more varied and slower-paced songs, some of which borrowing elements from other genres like hip hop. Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews from music critics and suffered dismal sales partly due to the poor distribution and support by Bong Load. Some critics found the album predictable and too similar to previous L7 albums, but others highlighted certain songs for their nifty musical style. Background and recording Slap-Happy is the follow-up to L7's 1997 album The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum. Like its predecessors, The Beauty Process was released by Slash Records in collaboration with Reprise, a major record label owned by the Warner Music Group. After the release of The Beauty Process, bassist Gail Greenwood, who replaced founding member Jennifer Finch in 1996, left the band due to uncoordinated schedules; Greenwood was rooted in Rhode Island, while L7 was based in Los Angeles, California. L7 would then continue as a trio formed by founding members Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner, and longtime drummer Demetra Plakas. In 1998, the band released a live album, Live: Omaha to Osaka, through the independent record label Man's Ruin Records. After being dropped by Reprise in 1997, L7 was interested in maintaining an independent, do it yourself approach. Sparks and Gardner explained that the band wanted to release an album in 1999, and if they opted for another major label opportunity, they would certainly have to wait until 2000 for a release slot. As a result, the band signed a deal with Bong Load Records and formed Wax Tadpole Records, an independent record label named after the first song of their self-titled debut album. Although the band had left the indie music scene before due to distribution problems, Sparks said that she would be watching the Bong Load deal to ensure the distribution of Slap-Happy, noting that \\"there's nothing more painful to tour for a record and the fans not being able to find your record in stores.\\" Most of the songs on Slap-Happy were recorded before the band decided to form Wax Tadpole. Sparks and Gardner wrote all the songs, usually at Gardner's home, even though the whole group contributed to the album in one form or another. Unlike its predecessor, Slap- Happy was made with a low budget. According to Sparks, \\"We utilized a lot of home studios, did a lot of our tracking ourselves, used a lot of first takes. I think there's a lot of life in this record, and yet I think when we started our own label we were fearing having to take a major step down in production because of the financial aspects.\\" The album was produced by Brian Haught, a friend of the band who let the band use his studio \\"just out of the kindness of his heart.\\" It was recorded and mixed at Synical Labs, PCS Studios, Sound City, de Prume Studios, Sonors Studios, and King Sound and Pictures in Los Angeles. Audio mastering took place at Precision Mastering in Los Angeles. Music and lyrics Slap-Happy was considered more varied than previous L7 albums. Although the album features several songs with aggressive guitar riffs that are reminiscent of the band's previous releases, as seen in the tracks \\"On My Rockin' Machine\\", \\"Long Green\\" and \\"Mantra Down\\", it also contains slow-paced and guitar-driven ballads like \\"Livin' Large\\" and \\"Freezer Burn\\". The former song was described by Marc Weingarten of Rolling Stone as \\"a kind of rallying cry for the indie-rock underclass\\", while the latter was seen as a melodic song that \\"juxtaposes harsh words delivered in mellow, floating vocals.\\" Slap-Happy also contains songs that borrow elements from genres other than rock. For example, the song \\"Little One\\" contains elements of both polka and country music. As Sparks noted, \\"We're all into all kinds of music, but I listen to very little rock, actually. Our approach was to pretty much do what we've always done, but we're not concerned with sticking with a particular style. There's diversity in our songwriting.\\" The track \\"Freeway\\", which was referred by the band as \\"the feel bad dance hit of the year\\", features a hip hop-influenced style with sampled voices. Its lyrics were inspired by an article in Los Angeles Times about a man who stopped his truck on a Los Angeles freeway and committed suicide after litting his truck on fire and obstructing the traffic. The sampled voices were taken from Casio keyboards that Sparks and Suzi had previously bought at a Guitar Center store. The album features humorous and irreverent lyrics. Sparks noted that many songs are \\"double-sided. There's a lot of masking of fuck-you's going on.\\" She also said that Slap-Happy was \\"almost a spit in the eye of our label, who had dropped us. It was like, 'Fuck you, we‚Äôre going to make another record anyway, so fuck off!' Some of the writing on [the] record is very angry, because we were pissed.\\" The opening track \\"Crackpot Baby\\", which is the first L7 song that features a three-part vocal harmony, features \\"unforgiving lyrics about plastic L.A. types\\", while \\"Stick to the Plan\\" is about a \\"chronic masturbator / With love in his eyes\\". Promotion and release Slap-Happy was released on August 24, 1999 on vinyl and CD. A different version of \\"Freeway\\" was released by the online record label Atomic Pop in February 1999. To promote the album, a plane flew over the crowd during the Lilith Fair concert tour at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California on July 17, 1999, with a banner that read: \\"Bored? Tired? Try L7.\\" The following day, an airplane towed a banner over the crowd during the Warped Tour at the Stone Pony lot in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The banner read: \\"Warped Needs More Beaver, Love L7.\\" The band supported the album with a tour across the US that started on August 15, 1999 in San Diego, California and ended on September 24, 1999 in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Bassist Janis Tanaka, formerly of the San Francisco band Stone Fox, joined the band as part of the touring group. The band also toured across Europe in 2000. Unlike previous L7 albums, Slap-Happy did not chart in either the US or the UK. In 2008, Sparks revealed that the album suffered dismal sales partly due to the poor distribution and support by Bong Load. Critical reception Upon release, Slap-Happy received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Marc Weingarten of Rolling Stone praised the band for \\"doing punk metal right\\", commenting that Slap-Happy \\"is all hopped-up, pared-down riffage with no apologies or gratuitous change-ups.\\" Q magazine highlighted the album for its \\"distinctive punk noise\\", which \\"stays roughly the same but evolves enough to be interesting.\\" In contrast, Craig Daniels of Exclaim! criticized the album's sound for being \\"sterile and lacking in energy\\" compared to previous L7 albums, but overall considered Slap-Happy to be \\"a fairly solid record\\". Entertainment Weekly editor Natasha Stovall highlighted the album's different approach, stating that although the \\"neo-Go-Go's vibe\\" of songs like \\"Livin' Large\\" and \\"Little One\\" can be disappointing \\"for those addicted to the ultra-macha-punk throb of L7 watersheds\\", Slap-Happys \\"harmonious pop sweetness\\" has \\"a super-catchy, Joan Jett-meets-the-Breeders feel that zestfully floors the accelerator.\\" Jason Hardy of Daily Nebraskan stated similar pros, noting that the album's new style introduced a \\"groovy\\" side of L7 that \\"most probably didn't know existed.\\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as \\"a respectable but predictable effort\\", stating that it \\"leaves very little lasting impression\\" even though \\"a few of the songs hit hard, and the band sounds energetic and muscular.\\" Not all reviews were favorable, though. Erik Himmelsbach of Spin criticized Slap-Happy for essentially being the same as all of the band's previous albums, commenting \\"What was once fast and loose and dump now sounds lazy and stupid\\". Raoul Hernandez of The Austin Chronicle heavily criticized the second half of the album for being \\"one long, nasal, wise-ass line after wise-ass line from Donita Sparks, who [...] is quickly becoming self-parody.\\" Although the album received a mixed reaction from media outlets, Sparks retrospectively regards Slap-Happy as \\"a good record\\", and considers it her third favorite L7 album, behind The Beauty Process and Smell the Magic.

Rock Lodge Club and Sky Farm, also based in New Jersey, were founded in 1932 as the first permanent nudist communities in the United States. Both clubs are active today. History Rock Lodge Stone House circa 1938 This newspaper ad probably ran in the 1940s during World War II given its reference to saving gasoline and \\"rubber\\" tires, and touting Rock Lodge Club's proximity to New York City. In the ad, AGA stands for the American Gymnosophical Association, the group promoting social nudism at the time. The eponymous Rock Lodge Stone House was built as a model fireproof farm house by engineer A. L. A. Himmelwright in 1907, and presently used as a residence and overnight rental facility at Rock Lodge Club. In the late nineteenth century, A. L. A. Himmelwright, an engineer at the Roebling Construction Company, bought the land that today is used by Rock Lodge nudist club. Prior to this, the property in the New Jersey Highlands, was used for timber and agriculture. There is also evidence of iron prospecting, possibly connected to a Thomas Edison mine works located nearby. In 1904‚Äì1905, Himmelwright used oxen to dredge a swamp, and built a dam to create a lake fed by a stream located near the lake, as well as by 17 underwater springs. This main spring is mentioned in deeds and early leases as a water supply for surrounding neighbors as well as for Rock Lodge. In 1907, Himmelwright erected a \\"model fireproof farmhouse\\", now known as the Stone House, which features a poured concrete roof, stained glass, a basement with coal furnace, and a state-of-the-art (in its day) water supply system which pumped water from the spring to a holding tank on the third floor. In 2007, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Stone House, the original plans for the construction of the building were reproduced. Other historic buildings that are maintained and in use today included a stable (now known as the Hacienda that houses the Club's office), an ice house, where, prior to the availability of refrigeration, ice harvested from the lake in the winter was stored for use through the summer. Around 1919, Himmelwright built a bungalow (clubhouse), when the property was being used as a training camp for boxers‚Äîduring the Roaring Twenties the property was a training camp for Jack Dempsey, boxers and wrestlers. Ben Roller, a physician and world class professional wrestler, ran the Rock Lodge Health Farm as per display advertisement in the NY Times 1921. Display ads also ran in the Magazine of Wall Street in 1922. Amenities included an indoor world class handball court and coal heat, with a fireplace and living room. Two historic cabins from the 1940s build from kits produced by the E. F. Hodgson Company are on the grounds and used as residences. During the Great Depression, Herman Shoshinsky leased the property as the proprietor of the American Gymnosophical Association (A.G.A.), and nudism came to Rock Lodge. In 1938 or 1939, the property was bought by Francis E. dePaolo, a chiropractor who lived across Rock Lodge Road near the spring. In 1942, Dr. dePaolo and Shoshinsky had a falling out, and the A.G.A. moved to Newfoundland, New Jersey. Rock Lodge as a cooperative nudist club began that year with a one- year lease. In 1946, a 10-year lease was negotiated with dePaolo, and summer cabins began to appear, though some may have been built in the 1930s. In 1957, a 40-year lease was signed, and a building boom occurred. Along with summer cabins, much of the club infrastructure was built in the late 1950s and 1960s. By the late 1980s, the end of a 40-year lease was in the near future, and several attempts were made to organize a purchase by members. In 1990, Rock Properties Inc. was formed as a non-profit organization, and money was raised by members for the purchase of . Another land purchase was made in 1995, bringing the total present club to . Rock Lodge Club is a member of the American Association for Nude Recreation.

It is jointly owned by Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited and Hong Kong Caterers Ltd. Founded in 1956, the company operates over 1,000 outlets in Hong Kong, China, Cambodia and Vietnam. These include bakeries, fast food shops restaurants and Starbucks coffee shop licences. Maxim's restaurants have been targeted by conservation campaigners concerned with Maxim's support of shark finning, and for controversial comments made by Annie Wu, daughter of one of Maxim's founders, during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. History Maxim's Caterers was founded by brothers S.T. Wu and James Wu. The grand opening of the first Maxim's restaurant in Hong Kong, located in the basement of Telephone House in Central, took place on 3 December 1956. Initially positioned as a \\"first-class restaurant and night- club\\", the arrival of competing international hoteliers in the 1960s prompted the company to focus more on \\"morning tea\\", lunch, and snacks. A holding company, Maxim's Caterers Limited, was formed in October 1972 to acquire the Maxim's and Jade Garden restaurant brands. By early 1973, the group operated 15 restaurants. Longtime company managing director S.T. Wu stepped down in early 2000, and was replaced by his 29-year-old grandson Michael Wu Wei-kuo, who had previously served as chief financial officer. Brands Simplylife Bakery Cafe in Queensway Plaza, Admiralty In 1998, Maxim's launched a restaurant series named m.a.x. concepts, which managed restaurant brands including MAX, Cellini, Mecca, Thai Basil, eating plus, Mezz, caf√© Landmark, Emporio Armani Caff√©, and modern restaurants Kiku and Miso. In 2004 the company opened the French-Vietnamese restaurant chain Rice Paper. In the same year, Maxim's Fast Food began producing ready meals and appetisers to be sold in 7‚Äì11 and Wellcome supermarkets. Maxim's bought Genki Sushi in early 2006, and the company introduced the American restaurant chain Lawry's The Prime Rib to Hong Kong the same year. Maxim's and Australian chef Geoff Lindsay opened the restaurant \\"Pearl on the Peak\\" in the Peak Tower. The company is the licensee of Ippudo ramen, Shake Shack and The Cheesecake Factory in various territories. In May 2000, Maxim's partnered with Starbucks Coffee International, Inc. to form Coffee Concepts Ltd., holding licences for both Hong Kong and Macau. In 2005, Maxim's have rebranded most of its restaurants as MX.  Controversies  Shark fin protestors at Maxim's HQ, Hong Kong in 2018 Shark fin controversy Maxim's have been targeted by campaigners regarding the company's support of shark finning. On 10 June 2017 dozens protested at their flagship 'Maxim's Palace' restaurant for selling threatened and endangered shark species. 50 protestors attended a demonstration at Maxim's branch at The University of Hong Kong on 10 February 2018. On 15 June 2018 protestors directly targeted Maxim's headquarters in a demonstration that also targeted Starbucks' regional licensee being Maxims. 2019‚Äì20 boycott campaign Maxim's outlets have been the target of boycotts and vandalism during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests after Annie Wu, the daughter of Maxim's co-founder James Wu, denounced the pro-democratic movement during an appearance at the United Nations. She has also repeatedly denounced Hong Kong youth, stating that Hong Kong should \\"give up\\" on two generations of \\"lost\\" youngsters, and claimed that she would \\"not waste [her] time talking to them, as they have no idea what they are doing\\". She criticised young Hong Kongers for their alleged anti-China sentiment, which she blamed on a lack of Chinese history education starting from the kindergarten level. Wu called on the Chinese Foundation Secondary School, which she founded, to fire faculty and expel students who boycotted classes. Her actions, considered as suppression of freedom of speech, aroused the anger of protesters. Annie Wu holds only 0.33 per cent of the shares of Hong Kong Caterers Ltd which owns 50 per cent of Maxim's Caterers Ltd, and has no managerial responsibilities in the company. However, it was revealed by David Webb that Annie Wu received HK$1.3 million in dividend payouts for the 2018 fiscal year.

James Cuthbertson was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the eldest son of William Gilmour Cuthbertson and his wife, Jane Agnes Cuthbertson. James was educated at the secondary school, Trinity College, Glenalmond, Perthshire, where he played on the school cricket team. He studied for the Indian civil service, and having been admitted as a probationer went on to Merton College, University of Oxford, England. He failed to pass a necessary examination and was obliged to abandon the idea of a career in India. His father had become manager of the Bank of South Australia at Adelaide, and in 1874 Cuthbertson decided to go to Australia also. In 1875 Cuthbertson joined the staff of the Geelong Grammar School as classical master under the pretense that he had completed his degree at Oxford. He founded the School Quarterly, to which he contributed many poems, and the first collection of these was published at Geelong under the title Grammar School Verses in 1879, an exceedingly rare little pamphlet not listed in the bibliographies of either Serle or Miller. In 1882 he returned to England and continued his course at Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1885. He immediately returned to Australia and rejoined the staff of Geelong Grammar School. In 1893 Barwon Ballads by \\"C\\" was published in Melbourne, and at the end of 1896 Cuthbertson was encouraged to resign his position by the new Head Master Leonard Harford Lindon, who found his erratic behaviour unacceptable, and Cuthbertson agreed to do so. He had enjoyed a close relationship with the students of the school and the former Head Master, John Bracebridge Wilson, however, his alcoholism was well known and boys were placed on \\"Cuthy duty\\", which involved at times pulling him out of the gutter. After a visit to England he lived for a period at Geelong and then near Melbourne, still occasionally sending verse to the school magazine. He died suddenly from an overdose of veronal while staying with a friend at Mount Gambier on 18 January 1910. After his death a memorial edition of his poems, Barwon Ballads and School Verses, with portrait frontispiece, was published by members of the Geelong Grammar School. Much of Cuthbertson's work is occasional verse, only of interest to old boys of the school he loved so much and of a generally low standard; but he sometimes wrote verse with simplicity and restraint, which gives him a place among the poets of Australia. He is represented in several anthologies. As a school-master he was a strong influence, and set standards which have become traditions of the school.

Plot summary  Pangbourne Village is an estate for the upper middle class, protected by security fences and discreet guards. Its ten families are wealthy, respectable, 40-something couples with adolescent children on whom they lavish everything money can buy. One morning it is discovered that all the adult residents have been killed and the children have disappeared without trace. Dr Richard Greville of Scotland Yard puzzles over the scanty evidence: it gives no leads to the identity of the murderers and kidnappers. No demands for ransom are received. No terrorist group claims responsibility. The reader soon realizes that the missing children are also the missing murderers. Their controlled upbringing has left them no way to establish their own identities except by rebelling into criminal savagery. However, in a tradition of obtuse policemen going back to Inspector Lestrade in the Sherlock Holmes stories, Greville resists drawing this obvious conclusion - until the children strike again.

He was Vice President of Argentina during the first 10 months of President Fernando de la R√∫a's term, and headed the ALADI Secretariat from 2011 to 2017. Biography √Ålvarez was born in Buenos Aires. His father was a printing worker, and the younger √Ålvarez's first experience in politics would be in the splinter trade union CGT de los Argentinos, formed in 1968 by Raimundo Ongaro. He earned his degree in history at the University of Buenos Aires. √Ålvarez married three times in his youth: Marta Chojo, Gloria L√≥pez Lecube, and Liliana Chiernajowsky. He had two daughters with his second wife, though his third marriage would be the most enduring. He met Liliana Chiernajowsky, who had spent 7 years as a political prisoner during the Dirty War, shortly after her release in 1981. They had one daughter. He served as an adviser at the Regional Economies Commission of the Argentine Senate from 1983 to 1989. √Ålvarez established Unidos in 1985, a periodical in support of the progressive wing of the Justicialist Party that would become influential in Argentine universities through the student organization APU. He was elected National Deputy for the Justicialist Party in 1989, but split from the party shortly afterward over disagreements with President Carlos Menem's turn to the right, creating an independent caucus known as The Group of Eight. √Ålvarez joined a group of politicians of different progressive parties, as well as former Justicialists, in 1991 to create the Frente Grande coalition party. He was again elected congressman for the 1993‚Äì97 period, as well as a member of the Constitutional Convention that drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. He took part in the creation of the FrePaSo coalition in 1994. Nominated candidate for vice-president on Jos√© Octavio Bord√≥n's ticket, they obtained second place in the 1995 presidential elections. FrePaSo joined the Radical Civic Union in 1997 to form the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (usually known as the Alianza). √Ålvarez was reelected that year to the Chamber of Deputies, this time within the Alianza, in 1997. He ran again as a vice-presidential nominee in 1999, and was elected Vice President of Argentina with Alianza nominee Fernando de la R√∫a in the 1999 presidential elections. Revelations of bribery on the part of President de la R√∫a in the passage of a labour flexibility law bill in 2000 led √Ålvarez to resign his post on 6 October 2000, denouncing corruption in the administration and in the Senate. His resignation was followed a year later by de la R√∫a's own resignation in the face of the December 2001 riots in Argentina. He retired from public life for five years. His marriage to Liliana Chiernajowsky ended, and his notable later relationships included those with politician Vilma Ibarra and actress Soledad Silveyra. He was appointed as President of Mercosur's permanent representatives committee, CRPM (Comisi√≥n de Representantes Permanentes del Mercosur). He took office on 9 December 2005, was reelected in 2007, and served until December 2009. √Ålvarez underwent vascular bypass surgery in 2009, and recovered. He took office as General Secretary of the Latin American regional trade organization, ALADI (Asociaci√≥n Latinoamericana de Integraci√≥n), on 1 September 2011 and served in that capacity for six years.

It is known for its Art Nouveau interior decor. In the mid 20th century Maxim's was regarded as the most famous restaurant in the world. History An 1899 menu, printed on a handkerchief Maxim's was founded as a bistro in 1893 by Maxime Gaillard, formerly a waiter. It became one of the most popular and fashionable restaurants in Paris under its next owner, Eugene Cornuch√©. He gave the dining room its Art Nouveau decor, installed a piano,Piano ma non solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Paris, Anagramme Editions, 2012, p. 8-9. and made sure that it was always filled with beautiful women. Cornuch√© was accustomed to say: \\"An empty room... Never! I always have a beauty sitting by the window, in view from the sidewalk.\\" It was so famous that the third act of Franz Leh√°r's 1905 operetta The Merry Widow was set there. In 1913, Jean Cocteau said of Maxim's: \\"It was an accumulation of velvet, lace, ribbons, diamonds and what all else I couldn't describe. To undress one of these women is like an outing that calls for three weeks' advance notice, it's like moving house.\\" In 1932, Octave Vaudable, owner of the restaurant Noel Peters, bought Maxim's. He started selecting his clients, favouring the regulars, preferably famous or rich, beginning a new era of prestigious catering under the famous Vaudable family which lasted more than half a century. Famous guests of the 1930s included Edward VIII and Jean Cocteau, a close friend and neighbor of the Vaudables. The playwright Georges Feydeau wrote a popular comedy called La Dame de chez Maxim (\\"The Lady from Maxim's\\"). During World War II, Maxim's was the most popular Parisian restaurant of the German high command and collaborationist celebrities. Hermann G√∂ring, Otto Abetz, and Ernst J√ºnger favored Maxim's when in Paris. Due to the support of officials, Maxim's enjoyed protected status during the occupation: its employees were not deported and it was exempt from food restrictions. The French resistance closed Maxim's after the liberation, but it reopened in September 1946. Maxim's was also immensely popular with the international celebrities of the 1950s, with guests such as Aristotle Onassis, Maria Callas, the Duke of Windsor and his wife Wallis Simpson, Porfirio Rubirosa, Max Oph√ºls, and Barbara Hutton. When the restaurant was renovated at the end of the decade, workmen discovered a treasure trove of lost coins and jewelry that had slipped out of the pockets of the wealthy and been trapped between the cushions of the banquettes. In 1956, the fame of the restaurant led to it becoming the namesake for a Western-inspired restaurant in Hong Kong, Maxim's Boulevard. The restaurant achieved rapid success and eventually developed into the conglomerate Maxim's Caterers, the largest catering corporation in Hong Kong by revenue and market share, and one of the largest in all of East Asia. In the 1970s, Brigitte Bardot caused a scandal when she entered the restaurant barefoot. Other guests of this time period were Sylvie Vartan, John Travolta, Jeanne Moreau, Barbra Streisand, and Kiri Te Kanawa. It was during the fifties, sixties and seventies that Maxim's, under the management of Octave Vaudable's son, Louis Vaudable, became the most famous restaurant in the world and one of the most expensive ones as well. With his wife Magguy, Louis Vaudable assured Maxim's international reputation. Fran√ßois Vaudable, who had been directing the restaurant by his father's side for years, pursued the work of his family which gave Maxim's its era of glory. In 1981, more attracted by the scientific field than by the jet-set, the Vaudables offered to sell Maxim's to fashion designer Pierre Cardin. A rich Arab had offered to buy the restaurant, but they were upset at the idea of it falling into foreign hands. Cardin eventually accepted the offer. Under his management, an Art Nouveau museum was later created on three floors of the building and a cabaret was established, which Cardin filled each night with songs from the beginning of the 20th century. The chefs who worked at Maxim's included a young Wolfgang Puck. A New York location was opened in 1985, but it closed in 2000. Today The fa√ßade of Maxim's in 2012 Today, the restaurant and the Maxim's brand belong to Pierre Cardin. Other Maxim's restaurants have been opened in Tokyo, London, Beijing, Monaco, Geneva, Brussels, and Doha. The Maxim's brand has been extended to a wide range of goods and services.

The framework is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License and is a standard part of the Linux kernel since Linux 2.6. AppArmor, SELinux, Smack, and TOMOYO Linux are the currently accepted modules in the official kernel.  Design  LSM was designed to provide the specific needs of everything needed to successfully implement a mandatory access control module, while imposing the fewest possible changes to the Linux kernel. LSM avoids the approach of system call interposition as used in Systrace because it does not scale to multiprocessor kernels and is subject to TOCTTOU (race) attacks. Instead, LSM inserts \\"hooks\\" (upcalls to the module) at every point in the kernel where a user-level system call is about to result in access to an important internal kernel object such as inodes and task control blocks. The project is narrowly scoped to solve the problem of access control to avoid imposing a large and complex change patch on the mainstream kernel. It is not intended as a general \\"hook\\" or \\"upcall\\" mechanism, nor does it support Operating system-level virtualization. LSM's access control goal is very closely related to the problem of system auditing, but is subtly different. Auditing requires that every attempt at access be recorded. LSM cannot deliver that, because it would require a great many more hooks, so as to detect cases where the kernel \\"short circuits\\" failing system calls and returns an error code before getting near significant objects. The LSM design is described in the paper Linux Security Modules: General Security Support for the Linux Kernel presented at USENIX Security 2002. At the same conference was the paper Using CQUAL for Static Analysis of Authorization Hook Placement which studied automatic static analysis of the kernel code to verify that all of the necessary hooks have actually been inserted into the Linux kernel.  Adoption  *AppArmor *SELinux *Smack *TOMOYO  History  At the 2001 Linux Kernel Summit, the NSA proposed that SELinux be included in Linux 2.5. Linus Torvalds rejected SELinux at that time, because he observed that there are many different security projects in development, and since they all differ, the security community has not yet formed consensus on the ultimate security model. Instead, Linus charged the security community to \\"make it a module\\". In response, Crispin Cowan proposed LSM: an interface for the Linux kernel that provides sufficient \\"hooks\\" (upcalls) from within the Linux kernel to a loadable module so as to allow the module to enforce mandatory access controls. Development of LSM over the next two years was conducted by the LSM community, including substantial contributions from the Immunix Corporation, the NSA, McAfee, IBM, Silicon Graphics, and many independent contributors. LSM was ultimately accepted into the Linux kernel mainstream and was included as a standard part of Linux 2.6 in December 2003. In 2006, some kernel developers observed that SELinux was the only widely used LSM module included in the mainstream Linux kernel source tree. If there is to be only one widely used LSM module, it was reasoned, then the indirection of LSM is unnecessary, and LSM should be removed and replaced with SELinux itself. However, there are other LSM modules maintained outside of the mainstream kernel tree (AppArmor, Linux Intrusion Detection System, FireFlier, CIPSO, Multi ADM, etc.), so this argument led to two results: 1. that developers of these modules started putting effort into upstreaming their respective modules, and 2. at the 2006 Kernel Summit, Linus once again asserted that LSM would stay because he does not want to arbitrate which is the best security model. LSM is likely to remain since additional security modules Smack (version 2.6.25), TOMOYO Linux (version 2.6.30, June 2009) and AppArmor (version 2.6.36) were accepted in the mainline kernel.  Reception  Some Linux kernel developers dislike LSM for a variety of reasons. LSM strives to impose the least overhead possible, especially in the case where no module is loaded, but this cost is not zero, and some Linux developers object to that cost. LSM is designed to provide only for access control, but does not actually prevent people from using LSM for other reasons, and so some Linux kernel developers dislike that it can be \\"abused\\" by being used for other purposes, especially if the purpose is to bypass the Linux kernel's GPL license with a proprietary module to extend Linux kernel functionality. Some security developers also dislike LSM. The author of grsecurity dislikes LSM because of its history, and that because LSM exports all of its symbols it facilitates the insertion of malicious modules (rootkits) as well as security modules. The author of RSBAC dislikes LSM because it is incomplete with respect to the needs of RSBAC. In particular, the author of RSBAC argues that: \\"LSM is only about additional, restrictive access control. However, the RSBAC system provides a lot of additional functionality, e.g. symlink redirection, secure_delete, partial Linux DAC disabling. All this has to be patched into kernel functions in a separate patch.\\". The Dazuko project argued that targeting the LSM API is a moving target, as it changes with each kernel release, leading to extra maintenance work. Other developers would like to have LSM modules stacked, e.g. the developer of the Yama LSM.

M. Morris for his 2001 novel Fiddleback.  Biography  He currently lives in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, in a 200-year-old stone house, with his wife, the artist Nel Whatmore. They have two children.  Career  Morris began his writing career in 1988 as part of the (now defunct) Enterprise Allowance Scheme, which was at that time paying claimants ¬£30 a week to be self-employed. His first novel, Toady, was published in 1989 (re- titled The Horror Club, and its text shortened by one-third for the US market) and several further books followed: Stitch, The Immaculate, The Secret of Anatomy, Mr Bad Face, Longbarrow, Genesis and Nowhere Near an Angel. Before Toady, he had written a novel called The Winter Tree, which was rejected by publishers, but allowed him to gain him some familiarity with them. In addition to his major works, Morris has published, as chapbooks, the novellas The Dogs (for Barrington Stoke, an imprint for 'reluctant readers') and The Uglimen. Morris has written a great deal of other short fiction, too, his first published short story being 1988's \\"Homeward Bound,\\" published in the magazine Dark Dreams (#6, 1988) and continuing well into the 21st century (for example, 2014's \\"Sins Like Scarlet,\\" co-written with Rio Youers) in the anthology Dark Duets: All-New Tales of Horror and Dark Fantasy. Morris has contributed many book reviews to the genre field, as well as essays. He has also published two volumes of short stories, Close to the Bone and Voyages into Darkness (with Stephen Laws) and a novel as \\"J.M. Morris\\": Fiddleback (which was renamed The Lonely Places and had a slightly longer epilogue for the US market, which the author claims was \\"in order to (quote from US editor): 'clarify matters for a US readership.'\\"). A further collection of short fiction, Separate Skins, was due for release from British small press publisher Tanjen, but the publisher went out of business around that time and the book ‚Äî introduced by Graham Joyce - remains unpublished. A fan of Doctor Who since being terrified by the show as a child, Morris has so far written several books for the BBC Books Doctor Who ranges. For the Eighth Doctor Adventures he wrote The Bodysnatchers, for the Past Doctor Adventures the novel Deep Blue, then Forever Autumn and Ghosts of India as part of the New Series Adventures, with the Torchwood novel Bay of the Dead being released on 29 May 2009. He has also written Doctor Who-related audio plays for Big Finish Productions including False Gods, Plague of the Daleks, House of Blue Fire, Moonflesh and The Necropolis Expresshttp://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/jago- litefoot-series-two-box-set-559 for the Jago and Litefoot spin-off series. The novel Nowhere near an Angel was intended to be his second J. M. Morris novel for Macmillan, but they rejected it as they considered 'J. M. Morris' to be a female writer (Fiddleback was written from a female point of view), despite Mark's publicity appearances for the novel.

History=Early Years Original squadron patch HMH-769 was originally activated as Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron (HMR) 769 on April 15, 1958. Based at Naval Air Station Oakland, CA, HMR-769 flew the compact single radial engine, twin overlapping rotor utility helicopter developed and produced by Piasecki Helicopter Corporation. In April 1959, HMR-769 transitioned to and begun flying the Sikorsky built HSS-1/SH-34G. A HMH-769 CH-53A Sea Stallion - circa January 1979 On April 1, 1961, HMR-769 was redesignated Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM) 769 and relocated to Naval Air Station Alameda, CA in July of that same year. H-34Ds touching down The squadron continued to fly the H-34 until 1971 when it transitioned to the Sikorsky built CH-53A \\"Sea Stallion\\" and on September 1, 1971, was redesignated Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron (HMH) 769. The squadron remained HMH-769 until June 1, 1980 when it was deactivated. The squadron's remaining personnel and aircraft were then consolidated into the other Marine Reserve Heavy Helicopter Squadron, HMH-772, redesignated HMH-772 Detachment A and given the callsign, \\"Roadhogs\\". Persian Gulf War and 1990s In April 1990, HMH-772 Detachment A became the first Marine unit to transition to and fly the former minesweeper RH-53D. With its minesweeping gear removed, the RH-53D proved to be a powerful replacement to the aging CH-53A airframe. On November 27, 1990 HMH-772 Det A was activated and deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of combat operations for Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm and served under Marine Aircraft Group 26. HMH-772 operated from Al Jubayl and the expeditionary combat base \\"Lonesome Dove\\" while supporting the assault. Upon conclusion of hostilities in the Persian Gulf, HMH-772 Det A embarked aboard the USS Tarawa (LHA-1) for the return to CONUS. While en route, the Roadhogs were called upon to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) to the country of Bangladesh during Operation Sea Angel. On 1 April 1993, HMH-772 Det A was redesigned as HMH-769. On May 1, 1996, the Roadhogs relocated from NAS Alameda to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, CA. While there, the squadron received its first CH-53E \\"Super Stallion\\" on August 23, 1996, replacing its aging RH-53D with the newer, more powerful airframe. In July 1998, the Roadhogs were the recipient of the Marine Corps Aviation Association's 1998 Pete Ross award for 4th MAW safety. On May 1, 1999, the Roadhogs relocated to Edwards Air Force Base located in Rosamond, CA. Global War on Terror In July 2001, the Roadhogs were the recipient of the Marine Corps Aviation Association's 2001 Pete Ross award for 4th MAW safety. The Roadhogs were activated for a third time on January 27, 2002 and deployed two aircraft and 17 Marines with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (SOC) to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa; Detachment Commanded by LtCol Jeff Freeman. This deployment marked the first time that a reserve squadron augmented an Active Forces MEU. HMH-769 Squadron photo taken in Afghanistan 2005 HMH-769 Pilot Maj.

Activated for their final time on January 5, 2004, the Roadhogs commanded by LtCol Rick Mullen deployed in March of that same year to Bagram air base, Afghanistan for seven months in support of Combined Joint Task Forces 180/76 for Operation Enduring Freedom 4 and 5. Midway through their deployment to Afghanistan, the Roadhogs were selected as the Marine Corps Aviation Association's 2005 Keith B. McCutcheon Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron of the year. On April 2, 2007, Headquarters Marine Corps directed the deactivation of HMH-772 Det A, with a completion date of no later than September 2008. The following year saw a flurry of activity as the squadron marched toward this milestone, transferring aircraft and personnel consistently throughout the year while still maintaining a rigorous schedule. On July 23, 2008, aircraft 45 commanded by Major Jodi Maroney departed Edwards AFB for MCAS New River. Major Maroney and her crew arrived MCAS New River on July 27, 2008. On the night of Saturday March 22, 2008, the Roadhogs began their last Annual Training period by executing section High Level Light (HLL) Night Vision Device (NVD) Confined Area Landings (CAL) in the local training area. Upon the sections return to base, the aircrew were informed that there was an injured climber located approximately 90 miles north on Mount Whitney. The aircrew gathered and reviewed all available information to include location and weather. After conducting deliberate planning and briefing the hop, the aircrew boarded their aircraft and took off for the injured climber. Once airborne, the aircrew flew direct to Lone Pine Airport, landed and conducted a face-to-face brief with the ground rescue coordinator. When complete with the brief, the aircraft took off and headed direct for the 12,000 MSL plus landing zone (LZ) that had been identified by rescuers at the injured climbers location. With both aircraft climbing to 14,000 MSL, the section was able to identify the LZ due to GPS coordinates and the headlamps that the ground rescuers were wearing. As lead started setting up to land, dash 2 remained in the overhead to provide coverage and radio relay. After lead had been in the LZ for roughly 15 minutes, the aircraft departed the LZ with the injured climber aboard and both aircraft returned to Lone Pine Airport to execute the patient transfer to civilian medical services. Once transfer complete, both Roadhog aircraft took off from Lone Pine and headed south to return to Edwards AFB landing around 0300. Due to the quick actions and professionalism of the aircrew, the injured climber reportedly survived his traumatic injuries. On Monday July 14, 2008, the Roadhogs launched their last two aircraft (section led by Col Phillips) from Edwards AFB for MCAS New River, NC. On Friday July 18, 2008 the section landed at MCAS New River, where the aircraft were transferred to HMH-461, Marine Aircraft Group 26, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. On August 2, 2008 at 1200, HMH-769 was deactivated at Edwards AFB. Reactivation The squadron will reactivate in 2026, equiped with the CH-53K King Stallion.https://www.aviation.marines.mil/portals/11/2019%20avplan.pdf Unit Awards A unit citation or commendation is an award bestowed upon an organization for the action cited.

Believers in SLI allege that they experience it on a regular basis with specific lamps and street lights and more frequently than chance would explain; however, SLI has never been demonstrated to occur in a scientific experiment, and those who claim the ability have been found to be unable to reproduce the effect on demand.Linton Weeks. \\"Bad Karma, Or Just Bad Lightbulbs?; The Mystery Of Blinking Street Lights.\\" The Washington Post.

Others claim the alleged phenomenon is caused by individuals having psychic or psychokinetic ability.  Reception  Author Massimo Polidoro writing in Skeptical Inquirer has considered claims of SLI to be examples of correlation not implying causation, or of confirmation bias: people are much more likely to notice when a nearby street light turns on or off than they are to notice a light turning on or off at a distance, or a street light in a steady state at any distance. This is compounded by a failure mode of street lights, known as \\"cycling\\", in which street lights of the high pressure sodium type turn off and on more frequently at the end of their life cycle.Cecil\\" Adams. \\"Can some people extinguish streetlamps by means of their bodily emanations?\\" In \\"The Straight Dope\\", October 28, 1994.

More recently varietal diversification, good plant breeding and the availability of effective fungicides have played a prominent part in cereal disease control. Use of break crops and good rotations are also good cultural control measures. The demise of UK straw burning in the 1980s also increased the importance of good disease control. Active control measures include use of chemical seed treatments for seed-borne diseases and chemical spray applications for leaf and ear diseases. Development of resistance by diseases to established chemicals has been a problem during the previous 30 years. In the USA Wheat is subject to more diseases than other grains, and, in some seasons, especially in wet ones, heavier losses are sustained from those diseases than are in other cereal crops. Wheat may suffer from the attack of insects at the root; from blight, which primarily affects the leaf or straw, and ultimately deprives the grain of sufficient nourishment; from mildew on the ear; and from gum of different shades, which lodges on the chaff or cups in which the grain is deposited.

P. Boatman (born 1956 in St Pancras, London), is an English professional poker player and the oldest member of the poker-playing foursome known as The Hendon Mob. He is the older brother of Ross Boatman, and resides in Archway. During his lengthy poker career, Boatman became one of the pioneers of poker on television by regularly appearing in the Late Night Poker television series. He was also the first person to reach three consecutive final tables at the World Series of Poker (WSOP), and came close to winning a WSOP bracelet. In 2013, Boatman won his first career World Series of Poker bracelet in Event #49, $1,500 No-Limit Hold'em, winning $546,080. Early years Boatman grew up to socialist parents in Somerstown, London. He left school at his earliest opportunity, following pressure from his ongoing truancy. He went on to travel for some time early in his life, and has both lived and worked in Barcelona, Australia, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka. He has worked as a bartender, builder, English teacher, journalist, computer programmer (for P&O;), and as a legal advisor in Bermondsey, where he never lost a trial. He credits a near-death experience he had in a motorcycle accident, and the death of his younger sister Jo from cancer of giving him a sense of perspective in life. Boatman's hobbies include sky diving, snowboarding, and scuba diving. He is the godfather to his brother Ross' son. Boatman used to play poker at home with friends and later taught his brother, Ross, how to play. They began to attend poker tournaments together at the Vic on Edgware Road, where he won the first tournament he entered, a seven-card stud event paying around ¬£2,000. Together they went to a private poker game run by Joe Beevers and Ram Vaswani, with whom they became good friends. The four went on to be called The Hendon Mob. Together, they were invited by Nic Szeremeta to take part in the brand new Late Night Poker television series, where he reached the Grand Finals in series 3 and 4. During series 5 and 6, he commentated for the show, alongside Jesse May. Poker career=World Series of Poker Boatman first cashed in a World Series of Poker (WSOP) event in 2000 in the $3,000 no limit hold'em event. 4 days later he finished in the money in the $10,000 no limit hold'em main event, finishing in 16th place. (According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, he was the chip leader for much of the tournament.) He also finished in the money of the main event in 2001 (33rd) and 2006 (854th). Boatman narrowly missed out on a WSOP bracelet in the 2002 $2,000 pot limit hold'em event. His runner-up finish earned him $77,160 after outlasting a field including Erik Seidel, Johnny Chan, Phil Gordon, and John Juanda. This 2nd-place finish was one of a record three back-to-back final tables, which earned him a win in the European Poker Awards Tournament Performance of the Year category. He also finished one place off a fourth consecutive final table. At the 2013 WSOP, Boatman bested a field of 2,247 entries to win Event #49, $1,500 No-Limit Hold'em. He defeated Brian O'Donoghue in a three-hour, back-and-forth heads-up match to win his first bracelet and $546,080.

It stars Steve Guttenberg, Elizabeth McGovern and Isabelle Huppert, and was shot in Baltimore in the Mt. Vernon neighborhood. Based on a novel The Witnesses, by Anne Holden, it tells the story of a young executive who starts an affair with the wife of his boss which then escalates into nightmare after he lies to the police in order to protect her. Plot Terry (Steve Guttenberg) asks his boss's wife Sylvia (Isabelle Huppert) to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims that it was he who was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise (Elizabeth McGovern) is able to pick out the attacker, Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms. He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack. Disguising herself, she goes to a bar where Carl is drinking and signals her availability. Terry follows her as she leaves to go home and, when Carl attacks, the two are able to repel him. He escapes, only to be caught by the police who Terry forewarned.

Olsen as Late Night Shopper *Leon Rippy as Seedy Bartender Production=Development Curtis Hanson read the novel The Witness by Anne Holden and tried to get the film rights. They had been bought by Paramount who had them for 15 years. Hanson did a deal with the studio to write the script. His adaptation added the character of Denise, the assaulted waitress. Casting Hanson says Elizabeth McGovern was his \\"only choice\\" to play Denise. \\"Robert De Niro was obsessed with McGovern in Once Upon a Time in America. Dudley Moore was obsessed with her in Lovesick. So it's fun to have her play a part where her beauty is secondary. At a certain point she takes over the plot. She's the victim who becomes the aggressor.\\" In the script Sylvia was American but Hanson decided to cast Isabelle Huppert. \\"She gives the movie a little extra something,\\" said Hanson. \\"Being French, she has a veneer of sophistication. She's glamorous and belongs to a world that he aspires to. Isabelle also added a contrast with Elizabeth, to whom Steve's character was initially unattracted.\\" Hanson says Steve Guttenberg was not his first choice for the lead but rather a suggestion of Dino DeLaurentiis. \\"Dino thought that if the movie wasn't successful, at least he'd have a young person in the lead who is liked and is known for comedy,\\" said Hanson. Guttenberg was very enthusiastic to do the film and Hanson agreed to cast him after they had dinner together. \\"I thought the picture should have his enthusiasm and his humor,\\" Hanson said. \\"Steve was dying to play the part. It was something different for him. He perceived his character as more of a leading man than a comedian.\\" Shooting The film was shot in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland and in North Carolina at DeLaurentiis' DEG studios in Wilmington. Music The music for the film was composed by Michael Shrieve and Patrick Gleeson, and released as the official soundtrack album on LP in 1986. Critical reception Upon its original release, The Bedroom Window was met with a negative feedback by Vincent Canby in The New York Times. The film subsequently received mixed to mildly positive reviews from other film critics. James Berardinelli gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and called it \\"a promising thriller [gone] badly wrong\\". Jack Sommersby recommended it as \\"a first-rate thriller that only occasionally missteps\\", but reflected negatively on its story. Derek Armstrong described it as \\"a diligent, suspenseful thriller\\" with \\"a tense, focused story\\", pointing out, however, the inferiority of the third act to the rest of the film as well as loose plot threads. As of August 2020, the film holds a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bedroom_window See also * Isabelle Huppert on screen and stage ReferencesExternal links  Category:1987 films Category:1980s crime thriller films Category:1987 independent films Category:1980s psychological thriller films Category:Adultery in films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American thriller drama films Category:De Laurentiis Entertainment Group films Category:English-language films Category:Films about miscarriage of justice Category:Films based on crime novels Category:Films directed by Curtis Hanson Category:Films produced by Martha De Laurentiis Category:Films set in Baltimore Category:Films set in Maryland Category:Films shot in Baltimore Category:Films shot in Maryland Category:Films shot in North Carolina Category:Rape and revenge films Category:American serial killer films Category:American neo-noir films ","title":"The Bedroom Window (1987 film)"},{"id":"3761241","text":"320px The River Shin (, ) is a river in the Scottish North West Highlands.

Pinney was the former president of the New York Herpetological Society and the author of The Snake Book. He was also an ardent spelunker and the author of Cave Exploration. Roy Pinney worked for the New York Daily News (Brooklyn Section, editor Jack Hoins) for 18 years working as photographer and writer, a familiar figure around New York City arriving on assignments on his 1928 Indian chief motorcycle. He later freelanced for Life, Look, Colliers, and Woman's Day and other magazines often going on his assignments in his World War II BT-13 plane. He was a founder and trustee of the ASMP. He was the photographer on more than seventy scientific trips. He was the producer of the American TV series \\"Secrets of Nature\\" (1955‚Äì59) and the cameraman and director of the Wild Cargo series in 1961. He was the oldest surviving of the 500 war correspondents to cover the D-Day invasion of Normandy before his death in 2010. He lived in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, the city of his birth. Family history and name change Pinney was born Pinyehrae Schiffer to Polish immigrant father Max Schiffer and mother Sarah Schiffer on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1911. His parents emigrated from Galicia in eastern Europe in the border region between Poland and Ukraine. At the age of 18 he Americanized his conspicuously Polish/Jewish name by altering his first name Pinyehrae into the last name Pinney and adopting the first name Roy in honor of Roy Chapman Andrews. Roy Pinney Biography The son of grocers, Pinney was born and raised on the Lower East Side. Pinney caught his first venomous snake, a rattler, at age 12 while attending Boy Scout camp. He was chastised, but it did not take. He attended high school at DeWitt Clinton High School, an all-boys public school at that time on 10th Avenue and 59th Street in New York City with classmates and lifelong friends Bernard Herrmann and Abraham Polonsky. In 1928 Pinney learned to use a camera and was employed by Underwood & Underwood through March 8, 1929. Pinney bagged more than 1,000 venomous serpents all over the planet. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals gave him stray snakes in need of homes and he kept the best for himself. His first love was photography. Pinney was wounded while photographing the Normandy invasion (\\"just a piece of shrapnel, nothing serious\\"), and later shot pictures of the Yom Kippur War. He sold his work to Life and Look Magazine when they were the pinnacle. He moved on to shooting advertising photos, \\"where the big bucks are,\\" he explained. He changed his life's course through his collaboration with the nature writer Ivan T. Sanderson, who brought a different animal to show off to Dave Garroway, the talk show host, each week. Pinney was Sanderson's producer and cameraman. He went on to work as cameraman for such nature show gurus as Marlin Perkins and Lorne Greene. Pinney wrote 2,000 articles and over 20 books, about everything from tribal cultures to how to survive the atomic bomb. The last was The Snake Book, published in 1981. He made more than 160 expeditions to remote destinations. A 1971 divorce left him bitter, so he threw away many of his cameras and stopped taking pictures. He once invested his personal savings in a new television series about a 25-year- old zoologist's adventures, shot 39 episodes and couldn't sell it. \\"She really has a special charisma with animals,\\" he insists to this day. On August 9, 2010 Pinney died at the age of 98, just four days before his 99th birthday. Pinney lived in Sanderson's former apartment, as he had since the divorce, surrounded by artifacts from endangered cultures, an undisclosed number of snakes, and 50,000 aging photographs. Herpetology Pinney was a world traveling herpetologist who collected venomous and nonvenomous snakes the world over. He was an active member of the New York Herpetological Society, serving as that organization's president for four years ending in 1989. Throughout his career Pinney developed a reputation as the go-to man for expert information on the care of snakes and other reptiles. During the 1980s and early 1990s the then active duty New York City police officers and now notorious \\"mafia cops\\", Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa, routinely gave Roy Pinney the exotic pets they would seize from drug dealers after the arrests they would regularly make. Over the years Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa gave Pinney several pythons, an anaconda and even a live Galapagos tortoise among other exotic animals. Photography and films In 1929 at the age of 18 Pinney became a freelance photographer and journalist for the Brooklyn section of the New York Daily News. He was also the camera man for a series of animal TV programs for Marlin Perkins, Ivan Sanderson and Arthur Jones. The program with Marlin Perkins was called Wild Kingdom and the program with Arthur Jones was called Wild Cargo. Later in his career Pinney owned and operated Photo-Library Inc., a stock photography business with nearly half a million photographs on file. The library included animals, architecture, babies, children, flowers, food, geography, girls, industrial, medical, personalities, romance, scenic views and sports. On its business cards Photo- Library Inc. touted its \\"100,000 Color Transparencies and 300,000 Black and White stock photographs.\\" Pinney's portrait of a baby won first prize in a Popular Photography photography competition beating out 46,000 other contestants and winning Pinney a new Packard convertible. In 1963 Pinney won the first prize for television commercials at the Cannes Film Festival. . In 2002 a 13.5x10.5 print of Pinney's 1936 photograph of hands \\"Reading Braille\\" was displayed in the Guggenheim Museum as part of the Buhl Collection photography exhibition on hands. In 2007 Pinney's photograph of two swimmers underwater in a pool appeared in a large coffee table book entitled POOLS by Kelly Klein. The book was published by Rizzoli. The ISBN number is 0-8478-2918-9 Author Pinney is the author of 24 books including: *The Snake Book (1981) () *Pets from Wood, Field and Stream (1969) *Vanishing Tribes (1968) () *Quest for the Unknown: Explorers of Today (1965) *Wild Animal Pets (1965) *Animals of the Bible (1964) (ASIN: B0007DV4UU) *Careers with a Camera (1964) *Advertising Photography: A Visual Communication book (1962) *The Complete Book of Cave Exploration (1962) *The Golden Book of Nature Crafts (1962) *How to Survive an Atomic Attack (1961) *The Golden Book of Wild Animal Pets (1959 *Underwater Archeology *Slavery: Past and Present *Animals, Inc. *Vanishing Wildlife *Young Israel *Wild Life in Danger *Collecting and Photographing your Microzoo Since their publication all of his books have gone out of print and have not been re-released. Roy Pinney also wrote a number of books that were never published including The Python Book, Our Vanishing Animal Friends, Animals Lost Forever, The Encyclopedia of Snakes, Vanishing Amphibians, and a book on his time as a war correspondent. War correspondent In 1944 Pinney became a war correspondent when he covered the D-day invasion of \\"Omaha beach\\" Normandy, France for Liberty magazine. He went on to cover more than a half dozen wars and conflicts around the world including conflicts in Afghanistan, Guyana, Spanish Morocco, Colombia, the Philippines and South Africa. In 1973 Pinney also photographed and reported on the Yom Kippur War in the Gaza Strip. Among the approximately 500 war correspondents covering the Normandy Invasion Roy Pinney at 98 years old was the oldest survivor. Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes fame was also among the oldest survivors. At the time of Pinney's death he had written an unpublished book on being a war correspondent which included detailed stories of his travels in World War II Europe. Friends and Associates Pinney went to elementary school with and was lifelong friends with Bernard Herrmann who scored Citizen Kane, Psycho, and Taxi Driver. He was lifelong friends with Abraham Polonsky. He was also friends with writer Ivan T. Sanderson.

In 1927 Roy competed in a Boy Scout essay contest to accompany Martin and Osa Johnson on one of their wild-life movie-making trips to Africa, but didn't make it. Years later, after Martin Johnson was killed in a plane crash, Osa and Roy became lifelong friends. In 1929 Roy traveled on an expedition to British Guiana with Somerset Maugham. Pinney was friends with the American photographer and model Bunny Yeager. In the book Bunny's Honeys Bunny mentions Pinney in her story of the origin of the phrase \\"the world's prettiest photographer\\" that is used to describe her. He was also friends with artist William Ward Beecher and with artist Ugo Mochi who designed his letterhead. Pinney was an early patron of George Nakashima, commissioning 18 pieces of furniture starting in 1947. He was also friends with Jim Fowler and Marlin Perkins of Wild Kingdom fame and filmed many of the episodes. Finally, Pinney was friends with John Steinbeck when Steinbeck lived in New York.

Mercer is also remembered for his attempt in 1990 to merge the two major Edinburgh clubs, Hearts and Hibs. Mercer reasoned that the Old Firm had far greater financial power than either Edinburgh club and that the only way to realistically compete was with a united Edinburgh club. Hibs fans suspected that the \\"merger\\" was more of a takeover by Hearts and they strongly resisted Mercer's bid to acquire a majority share in Hibs. The fans of Hibernian did not take kindly to the threat of a takeover and Wallace received death threats and other various abuse. One supporter was apprehended outside Mercer‚Äôs house with an axe. Mercer was eventually forced to abandon his plans as some key shareholders refused to sell to him, denying him the level of shareholding needed to liquidate Hibs. Sir Tom Farmer eventually took financial control of Hibs instead. In 2010, Mercer's widow and children issued a statement to the Edinburgh Evening News reiterating the reasons for the proposed merger of Hearts and Hibs. The statement also claimed that the increased dominance of the Old Firm since 1990 had vindicated the proposal. Death Mercer died of cancer on 17 January 2006.

After improving his grades, Nesson was accepted. Nesson surprised himself by achieving and retaining a ranking of first out of five hundred students. He is rumored to have achieved the highest grade point average since Felix Frankfurter graduated in 1907.

It was created in 1027 and existed until 1802, when it was secularised and absorbed into the County of Tyrol held by the House of Habsburg. Trent was a Hochstift, an Imperial State under the authority of a prince-bishop at Trento.  History  :See Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trento for ecclesiastical history Middle Ages A first Bishop of Trent is recorded as a participant of the synod at Aquileia in 301. The area was part of the Lombard Kingdom and the Kingdom of Italy, until the 951 campaign of German king Otto I against King Berengar II of Italy. In 952 Berengar had to cede the March of Verona to Otto, who enfeoffed his younger brother Duke Henry I of Bavaria. Trento Cathedral From 1004 Emperor Henry II the Saint and his successor Conrad II separated several smaller territories in the northeast of the Veronese march and granted them to the Trient diocese. Originally a Bavarian fief, by 1027 the prince-bishopric was established, together with the similar Prince-Bishopric of Brixen. The states were created to favor passage to Imperial armies across the Alps towards Italy along the two ancient roads, the Via Claudia-Augusta and the Via Altinate, entrusting the area to two bishops instead of often rebellious lay princes. The prince-bishops were true Holy Roman Empire princes, and enjoyed the right to take part to Imperial diets. The princes of Trento maintained a strong allegiance to the Emperor, even when the latter was excommunicated: this because they need his protection against the growing power of subjects like the counts of Tyrol, who controlled the area around Bozen, those of Eppan, and others. In one of the attempts to reassure his temporal authority over these lesser but fierce nobles, the bishop Adelpreto was slaughtered at Arco, on September 20, 1172, by the lords of Castelbarco. The supremacy of the prince-bishops of Trento and Brixen were however re-established by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1179 and again by his son Henry VI of Hohenstaufen. The bishop earned the right to have a coin of his own and to impose tolls. The Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen interwoven with the Habsburg County of Tyrol, 18th century The principate was reorganized and reformed by bishop Federico Wanga (1207‚Äì18), a relative of Emperor Otto IV. Allied with the Bishop of Brixen and allowing wide estates to the Teutonic Knights he managed to thwart at all the nobles' strength, and recovered much of the territories lost in the past years. In order to state in a definitive way his authority he also collected all the official documents certificating the bishop's authority in the so-called Book of St Vigilius (Codex Wangianus), Vigilius being the patron saint of Trento. Moreover, Federico supported trading over the Adige way across the Alps, and made concessions to the middle class. The drying of the valley allowed the area to become one of the most renowned of Italy for the production of wine. The statute issued by Federico on June 19, 1208, is considered the most ancient official document concerning the Alps mining industry. The city was encircled with a new line of walls and towers, and the building of the Cathedral was commenced. The death of Wanga in the Holy Land, during a Crusade, stopped his reforms. In 1236 Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen deposed the bishops and ensured to himself the authority over the important military area of Trento, annexing it to the Mark of Treviso ‚Äî the administration was entrusted to his faithful friend, Ezzelino III da Romano at Verona. In the 13th century the Counts of Tyrol took advantage of the confused situation to carve out a conspicuous power as a Vogt for himself, much at the loss of the Bishops of Chur, Brixen, the Archbishopric of Salzburg and Trento itself. Count Meinhard II of Tyrol (1258‚Äì1295), also Duke of Carinthia from 1286, totally subjected the bishops of Trento and Brixen under his power, and reorganized his new state along the more modern lines inspired to those of other Italian principalities. In the 14th century, during the disputes between the rival emperors Charles IV of Luxembourg and Louis IV of Wittelsbach, the principality suffered several destructions and was temporarily again annexed to the latter's Bavarian territories. The threat by Tyrol increased, when in 1363 Countess Margaret Maultasch ceded her lands to Rudolf IV of Austria from the mighty House of Habsburg. 15th and 16th centuries In 1419 the bishop George I of Liechtenstein (1390‚Äì1419) escaped the subjugation to Tyrol submitting directly to the emperor, but this did not prevent the bishops to lose further authority over the city and the countryside in the course of the 15th century, even though an attempt by the citizens to create a republic in 1407 was bloodily suppressed. In 1425 Trento was declared a commune. Another revolt broke out ten years later, and Austro-Tyrolese troops invaded the territory of the principality. In the following year, the bishops struggled in order to thwart the growing power of the Habsburgs, and in the end the principality reduced to an effective subjugation to Austrian authority. In June 1511 the two principalities of Trento and Brixen received the status of \\"perpetual confederate\\" states among Austrian possessions. The peace of 1516 with the Republic of Venice, however, reduced the principality to a discontinuous enclave between large Habsburg possessions. During the war against Venice, in 1509, the territory had been ravaged by Landsknechts returning from a failed expedition against Vicenza. This was followed by pestilences in 1510 and 1512, famines in 1512, 1519 and 1520, and an earthquake in 1521: these grievous happenings spurred the beginning of forms of resistance against Habsburg rule. A true rebellion broke out in 1525, called Bauernkrieg or \\"contadine revolt\\". The rebellers were led by Michael Gaismayr, who had devised a complex plan of liberation of all the territories of Brixen and Trento and program of social freedom based on equalitary principles (Landesordnung). The rebels, however, lacked organisation and were easily suppressed in 1526 by Austrian mercenaries and by the bishop Bernardo Clesio, who ferociously exterminated them in the battles of the Eisack valley and Sterzing. The rebellion leaders were beheaded, hanged or mutilated, while the simple followers were released but with a \\"mark of infamy\\" impressed on their brow. Any dream of further revolt ended when Gasmayr was murdered by the archduke's killer in Padua in 1532. Some thousand of Tyrolese and Trentine rebels took shelter in Moravia, near Auspitz, where they established \\"fraternal farms\\" (Bruderh√∂fe). Bishop Cardinal Bernardo Clesio is considered the true refounder (Neubegr√ºnder) of the authority of the princes of Trento. An adviser of emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg and a friend of Erasmus of Rotterdam, he played an important role in the election of Emperor Charles V of Habsburg at Frankfurt in 1519, and in that of his brother Ferdinand I as King of Bohemia in 1526. His personal charisma reverted the subalterne status of the Trento state between the Habsburg territories, gaining the seignory of Castelbarco and Rovereto. His statute of the city, issued in 1528, remained in use until 1807. Under Clesio's rule Trento was renovated with a new urbanistic asset, and a new great church, S. Maria Maggiore: these were needed in order to host the important and influential Council of Trent (1545‚Äì63), and, after the sudden death of Clesio in 1539, were completed by his successor, cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo. Also the economy and services were greatly improved. The presence of famous intellectual and scholars during the Council, spurred the diffusion of Renaissance in the principality. The introduction of the Counter-Reformation in the principality brought also a general recover of the Italian language over the German one, as the Protestant ideas had found more followers in the German-speaking population. This \\"Golden Age\\", however, was ended by Emperor Ferdinand I, who invaded the Trentine territories, occupying Rovereto and, in 1567, declaring the Confederation Treaty over. The dispute was settled only in 1578, when the Imperial Diet reinstated the prince-bishops' suzerainty. Modern Age In the 17th century the principality suffered for the economical consequences of the Thirty Years' War and of the decadence of Venetian trades. The principality was held by the Madruzzo family (who also indirectly controlled Brixen) until 1658, with the death of Carlo Emanuele. Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg assigned therefore the principality to his cousin Archduke Sigismund Francis, regent of Tyrol and Further Austria. Relationships with the Austrian Empire were again settled in 1662. Three years later, however, Sigismund Francis died and the principality was included in the Habsburg emperors' direct dominions. This however did not mean the loss of his semi-independent status, and several outstanding results were obtained anyway ‚Äî the balance active of 1683, the completion of the Castello del Buonconsiglio in Trento, and the drying of the marshes in the Adige valley. Rice cultivation was introduced in the lands obtained. The situation worsened at the beginning of the 18th century, when the Trentino and the Tyrol were invaded by French and Bavarian armies, and Trento itself was bombed for six days in September 1703. But the most dangerous menace to the principality status were the claims of emperor Charles VI of Habsburg to reunite under the Habsburg crown all the hereditary territories of his house. The bishops continued their struggle for independence against the growing Austrian prominence, until Napoleon's invasion of 1796.  Aftermath  The Principality of Trent (in pink) in 1804 Following the 1801 Treaty of Lun√©ville, the prince-bishopric in 1803 was secularized as the Principality of Trent, later part of the County of Tyrol, an Alpine crown land of the Austrian Empire from 1804. With Tyrol it was annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria according to the 1805 Peace of Pressburg, passed to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1810 and in 1814 was again incorporated into the Austrian crown land of Tyrol. Due to its predominantly Italian speaking population, the Trentino (Venezia Tridentina) was claimed by the Italian irredentism movement. It however remained a part of the Tyrolean crown land (Welschtirol), even after Austria had to cede the adjacent Veneto region after the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. According to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain the territory of the former Trent bishopric together with the southern part of the original County of Tyrol fell to the Kingdom of Italy.

He is best known for his time in WWE, where he won the WWE Tag Team Championship once with Santino Marella. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts. Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, notably having a small role in Spike Lee's 25th Hour., and a walk-on role in the second season of the HBO series The Wire. Prudius also had a role in Grindhouse, appearing in the \\"Werewolf Women of the SS\\" trailer; in addition to his credit under his real name and his WWE persona for the appearance as well as being a former Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) Heavyweight Champion, Prudius was the first Ukrainian to ever wrestle for the WWE.  Before wrestling  Prudius has won numerous achievements, becoming the 2005 USA Open Heavyweight Sambo Champion and a United States Kick-Boxing Association (USKBA) International Heavyweight Grappling Champion. He has also played American football for the Ukrainian National Team as well as Santa Barbara City College.  Professional wrestling career = World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE  Deep South Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling (2006‚Äì2008)= Prudius in August 2007 On January 17, 2006, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) announced that Prudius had signed a developmental deal and was sent to Deep South Wrestling (DSW). On April 7, 2006, he debuted under his real name and had his first match in DSW against Bobby Walker. On May 5, 2006, Prudius had his first untelevised WWE match during a house show in San Jose, California, defeating Rob Conway. The next night, at another house show in Sacramento, California, Matt Striker cut a promo on Prudius, calling him a \\"filthy immigrant\\", causing Prudius to attack him. Prudius then picked up the microphone and said he that he is \\"proud to be in America\\". On the December 18, 2006 episode of Raw, Prudius made an appearance as a WWE prospect named Vladimir Kozlov or Moscow Mauler, which became his ring name. For the next several weeks, Kozlov was interviewed on WWE programming, proclaiming his love for \\"Double Double E\\" (WWE), but also began drawing a villainous response after declaring his superiority over whatever wrestlers were competing at the time, saying \\"I could beat both of them\\". He then was taken off television for over a year while working in the developmental system and participating in a number of dark matches, including one at Armageddon 2006, all of which he won. On July 28, 2007 in Louisville, Kentucky, Kozlov won the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Paul Burchill, but gave the championship the same night to Michael W. Kruel due to an agreement they made before. = WWE Championship pursuits (2008‚Äì2009) = On the April 4, 2008 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov made his official WWE debut as a villain, with the unique quirk of having no entrance music and no Titantron video ‚Äì his \\"entrance\\" consisted of complete darkness except for a solitary spotlight following him to the ring. He defeated Matt Bentley in his first match, and over the following weeks, Kozlov would go on to easily win several matches, first against local talent and then established names including Colin Delaney, Funaki, Nunzio, Shannon Moore, Jimmy Wang Yang, Jamie Noble, and Domino. On the July 11 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov debuted an entrance theme and Titantron video as he defeated Stevie Richards. Kozlov on SmackDown in 2008 In the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he began demanding \\"better competition\\". On the September 12 episode of SmackDown, he started to seek that competition, attacking Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose feud between the three of them over the WWE Championship. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE title at Survivor Series after defeating The Undertaker by disqualification after he was attacked by Jeff Hardy. The match was originally intended to include Kozlov, Jeff Hardy, and Triple H, although Hardy was removed due to a storyline injury. The result of this was the addition of Edge to the match while it was in progress, and ultimately Edge would go on to pin Triple H and win the title. Continuing his pursuit of the WWE Championship, Kozlov competed in and was unsuccessful in winning a Beat the Clock Challenge match against ECW Champion Matt Hardy for another title shot. This led to the two meeting at Armageddon, where Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating Hardy in a non-title match. Kozlov competed in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering as the sixth participant, but was eliminated by Triple H after eliminating The Great Khali, Carlito, and Montel Vontavious Porter. He then qualified to be part of the No Way Out Elimination Chamber match, where he was pinned for the first time after receiving a Last Ride from The Undertaker, though he still remained unpinned in one-on-one competition. Kozlov's undefeated streak in televised singles competition ended on the March 2, 2009 episode of Raw, in which he was defeated by Shawn Michaels; this match was for the opportunity to face The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV. His first televised singles loss on SmackDown came against The Undertaker himself on March 13. = The Ruthless Roundtable (2009‚Äì2010) = On April 13, 2009, Kozlov was drafted to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 WWE draft, as ECW's only pick of the night. Shortly after the draft, his character was tweaked to further highlight the training he received within the Russian military. He won his first match on the brand when he easily defeated a local competitor. On the June 30 episode of ECW on Syfy, he teamed with William Regal to defeat Christian and Tommy Dreamer. His first defeat in singles competition on ECW came on the July 7 episode of ECW, where he lost a #1 contenders match to Christian for Tommy Dreamer's ECW Championship at Night of Champions. On July 21, Kozlov began an angle with Ezekiel Jackson in which, week after week, after one of them had easily defeated a local competitor, the other would come out and execute their finishing move on the fallen opponent in a game of one-upmanship. On the August 18 episode of ECW, Jackson was set to team with ECW Champion Christian against the team of Kozlov and number-one contender William Regal. Jackson turned on Christian, forming an alliance with Regal and Kozlov. Kozlov and Jackson aided Regal in his feud with Christian over the ECW Championship, but Regal was unable to capture the title. On the December 15 episode of ECW, Kozlov came out with Regal to face Jackson in an ECW Homecoming battle royal qualifying match. During the match, Regal turned on Kozlov by pulling his feet while at ringside, which ultimately cost him the match. After the match, Kozlov attempted to attack Regal, but Jackson jumped him from behind and both proceeded to attack Kozlov. This split Kozlov from the Ruthless Roundtable. = Teaming with Santino Marella (2010‚Äì2011) = Kozlov and Marella in November 2010 on Raw in Manchester, England When the ECW brand came to an end, Kozlov, along with all other ECW talent, became a free agent. Kozlov would make his debut for the Raw brand on March 8, 2010 in a handicap gauntlet match with John Cena competing against Kozlov, Mr. McMahon, Batista, Mark Henry, Drew McIntyre and Jack Swagger. On the May 3 episode of Raw, he would team again with his former tag team partner William Regal to face the WWE Tag Team Champions The Hart Dynasty, Kozlov and Regal were defeated when Regal tapped out to David Hart Smith's Sharpshooter. On the May 10 episode of Raw, he appeared backstage with Santino Marella, William Regal, and Flavor Flav in a backstage segment, where Marella asked to join him in a tag team. However, Kozlov refused to join, stating that \\"he (Marella) always loses\\". On the May 31 episode of Raw, Kozlov turned face for the first time when he slammed William Regal behind the referee's back during a mixed tag team match, allowing Santino Marella and Eve Torres to pick up the win. On the June 7 episode of Raw, he and Santino Marella were forced to compete in a dance-off, which Kozlov won. On June 14 episode of Raw, Kozlov served as a special referee for the match between Regal and Marella which Marella won after Kozlov intentionally gave him a fast count. On the June 28 episode of Raw, he fought Marella one on one with the stipulation being if Kozlov loses he would become Marella's tag team partner. He won, however, with Regal interfering after the match, Kozlov stopped Regal with a big boot to the chest and then carried Marella backstage. The following week, Kozlov teamed with Marella, defeating William Regal and The Great Khali. In the following weeks, Kozlov and Santino would continue their undefeated streak on both Raw and Superstars. At the Night of Champions, Kozlov and Marella competed in a tag team turmoil match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful as the titles were won by Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes. On the November 15 episode of Raw, Kozlov and Marella defeated The Usos (Jimmy and Jey) to be number one contenders for WWE Tag Team Championship. Kozlov and Marella challenged Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Survivor Series, but were unsuccessful. On the December 6 episode of Raw, Kozlov and Marella captured the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating the defending champions Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel, Mark Henry and Yoshi Tatsu, and The Usos in a four-way elimination tag team match. At TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs, Kozlov and Marella defeated Slater and Gabriel via disqualification to retain the title.

It was originally released in 1991 for MS-DOS; this version received an expansion in 1992. The Amiga, PC-98, Amiga CD32 and PlayStation versions were released in 1993, 1994 and 1996 respectively (the PlayStation version was retitled as simply Gunship, but was sometimes still referred to as Gunship 2000). A sequel, Gunship!, was released in 2000. Gunship 2000 significantly enhanced and expanded the features and gameplay from the original Gunship. Besides improved audio and graphics, key areas of change were enhanced terrain, the ability to fly multiple helicopter types, and the ability to command a team of helicopters and their crews.  Gameplay  AH-64 Apache ready for take off from a helicopter base in the Middle East theater (DOS) Gunship 2000 utilised roughly the same format as most of the other MicroProse flight simulators of the time: the player had a profile, chose their combat theatre, and either performed single missions or a campaign. The primary similarity was the randomly generated 'primary-secondary' mission types where the player was given a primary mission (destroy a target / pickup or drop off troops or cargo / recon an objective) and a less valuable secondary objective that included the same kind of tasks as a primary. The campaign strung these missions together in a 'tug-of-war' system. Victories advanced the player's side towards victory and harder missions, defeat went the other way (though the missions sometimes got harder too). Initially the player flies a lone helicopter to complete missions, choosing between AH-1 Cobra, AH-64 Apache, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, MD 530MG and UH-60 Blackhawk. As the player's rank increased, the RAH-66 Comanche and the AH-64B Apache Longbow were unlocked (the 'B' designation is due to the game being designed before the Longbow Apache was in service as the 'D' model). Using less powerful helicopters resulted in a higher mission score, though this had to be balanced with the likelihood of having enough fuel/weapons to complete the mission. Realistic tactics such as nap-of-the-earth flight and 'pop-up' attacks can be employed on account of the reasonably detailed terrain. Planning is often an important part of the game: fuel consumption is unrealistically high (to adjust for a limited game world), and the player can rarely lift off with full fuel and the best weapons loaded. Terrain and enemy presence are also to be considered (the intel briefing may often tell the player what to expect near targets). Usually a Forward Arming Refuel Point (FARP) is present in the mission. This is important, as the player may have to refuel or rearm during the course of the mission depending on the density of enemy and distance to objectives. On promotion to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, the player may gain control of several other helicopter wingmen whose helicopters can also be configured to the same extent as the player's. Wingmen can remain with the player or be sent off for separate tasks (such as completing the secondary objective), so a great deal of flexibility is present for tactical planning. The terrain modelling is much more advanced than in the original Gunship, with desert wadis and twisting ridgelines being well represented (this is very important for simulating helicopter combat, as cover using terrain is one of the primary tactics). The game has two primary theatres: the Middle East and Europe. Terrain was designed separately for each theatre; for instance, desert really was desert, and not just European farmland painted brown. Visuals in other areas were about on par for the private flight simulator technology at the time (the later PlayStation version of the game features much better graphics, including full textures on all 3D objects). Enemy forces include infantry, vehicles, tanks, anti-aircraft gun and missile systems, and airplanes. Other game objects included moving trains, civilian buildings, and even animals. Development The cockpit graphics were based on photos of actual army helicopters, though switches and buttons with no in-game function were left out to avoid screen clutter.  Expansion  MicroProse released the Gunship 2000: Islands & Ice expansion pack in 1992. It added two theatres of war (Antarctica and The Philippines), all previously released patches, and a mission editor. Gameplay followed closely on the heels of Gunship 2000, but added unique aspects for the two new theaters as well as a number of additional functions and new player aids, including: in-flight mission changes, air and artillery support, wind and weather (including whiteouts and magnetic disturbances in Antarctica), maintenance and weapon system downtimes, improved autopilot, targeting, navigation, and the addition of a HUD mission clock. One of the most innovative features was the mission builder. This tool enabled players to create and edit missions of their own design. Every aspect of a typical Gunship 2000 mission was available for use in the mission builder. It also provided a number of shortcut steps to enable players to quickly create new missions without having to, for example, place every defender on the map one-by-one. Players can even export a standard Gunship 2000 mission into the mission builder as a template for editing. Once completed, mission could be saved for play, editing or free exchange with other players. Very advanced for its day, the mission builder set the tone for many follow on products by enabling players to determine fun by their own standards.  Ports  A port of Gunship 2000 for the Atari Jaguar was announced in November 1993 after MicroProse was signed to be a third-party developer by Atari Corporation for the system, and despite kept being advertised for a late 1994 release, this version of the game went unreleased for unknown reasons. The PlayStation version was re-released on the PlayStation Store for download on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita on November 17, 2010 in Europe and on March 18, 2014 in North America. Reception In 1991, Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer, United States Army AH-64 pilot Bryan Walker, criticized Gunship 2000 for presenting a helicopter that \\"flies like an overloaded Huey\\", but nonetheless concluded that \\"the designers have succeeded in creating the best helicopter simulator game currently available, thorns included\\". Cited flaws included inaccurate flight models and avionics; awkward controls; and mediocre graphics and lack of ground texture. Strengths included a wide variety of accurately modeled weapons and the ability to control multiple types of helicopters in a squadron. 1992 and 1994 surveys in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game four stars out of five, and the magazine named it one of 1992's best simulation games. The game received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon. Walker reported that the Islands and Ice expansion and patches provided an improved flight model, the option to fly with two joysticks and other peripherals, and target designation. He found that he could recreate missions from his career with the scenario editor with \\"surprising accuracy\\", and concluded that the expansion \\"has helped transform what was a mediocre title into a much better gaming value ... my vote as 'Most Improved Game of the Year'.\\" PlayStation Magazine gave the PlayStation version of Gunship 2000 a score of 7/10, calling it an \\"immersive helicopter flying sim with engrossing, varied missions.\\"PSM 8. Next Generation gave it two out of five stars, remarking that \\"the shoddy graphics, sparse sound effects, and annoying gameplay will have you reaching for a pack of Tums.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Gunship 2000 at the Hall of Light * Category:1991 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Amiga 1200 games Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:CD32 games Category:Cold War video games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:DOS games Category:MicroProse games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Real-time tactics video games Category:Strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by David Whittaker Category:Video games scored by Jeff Briggs Category:Video games with expansion packs ","title":"Gunship 2000"},{"id":"3761352","title":"Gerard Kearns"},{"id":"3761357","text":"Albrighton may refer to: *Albrighton, Bridgnorth, a large village and civil parish in Shropshire, England, north-west of Wolverhampton *Albrighton, Shrewsbury, a small village in North Shropshire, England, north of Shrewsbury *Albrighton Hunt, a UK foxhound pack *Albrighton (surname) ","title":"Albrighton"},{"id":"3761381","text":"Bricklayers' Arms roundabout and flyover.

However, as south of the river living has become more popular, these have been supplemented on previously commercial and industrial sites on the route by private sector condominium units, extending and broadening the residential nature of the area and creating a more varied mixed tenancy population. This has been reinforced by the development of two large university halls of residence: Great Dover Street Apartments, a hall of Residence belonging to King's College London, principally for the nearby Guy's Hospital Campus teaching hospital and neighbouring this that for the London School of Economics 'Sidney Webb House' containing some 1,000 bedsitting/ study units.

It is located on the corner of Spring Garden Road and South Park Street across from the Halifax Public Gardens. It was built in 1927 by a consortium of investors led by the Canadian Pacific Railway who wanted a Halifax anchor to the chain of hotels operated by its Nova Scotian subsidiary, the Dominion Atlantic Railway.*\\"Lord Nelson Hotel\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Institute Along with the rival Canadian National Railway's Hotel Nova Scotian which began the same year, the Lord Nelson was Halifax's first modern hotel. The hotel was named after Admiral Horatio Nelson, who ironically never came to Halifax in his famous naval career (notably there is also an apartment building in Burlington, Ontario and a public school in London, Ontario both named after Lord Nelson: neither of which he attended), but whose name stood for naval traditions strongly associated with the heritage of Halifax.  History  On Friday, October 21, 1927, construction on the Lord Nelson Hotel began at the corner of Spring Garden Road and South Park Street on the old Dwyer property. The turning of the first sod was done by Mayor Kenny of Halifax, supported by a group of friends and well-wishers. The Lord Nelson Hotel opened for business on October 23, 1928. The hotel has changed hands over the years and is now privately owned. The task of supervising the construction was assumed by O.C. Gross, architect, with construction carried out by H.L.

The building has a reinforced concrete foundation, topped with a course of granite to support the brick walls. The hotels closest in style to the Lord Nelson Hotel at the time of construction was the Van Curler Hotel at Schenectady, New York, which was built for the General Electric Company & the Newfoundland Hotel, in St. John's. The walls of the Lord Nelson are of bluenose brick with ornate frame and Nova Scotia trip, with the concrete framework being covered in by brick. The aim of the construction was to use local materials and to award contracts locally. As much as possible materials available in Nova Scotia were used, although some had to be imported. The main entrance to the hotel is on South Park Street, and originally featured a semi-circular driveway with trees and shrubs. The Georgian style has been incorporated in the construction of the hotel, featuring special decorations pertaining to Lord Nelson. From the lobby you can see a large mural of Nelson addressing his men on the deck of his flagship HMS Victory, just before the Battle of Trafalgar. This painting was done by Sister Agnes Berchmans, a native of New Brunswick. Her family moved to Eelbrook, Nova Scotia and young Julia Landry entered the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, where she was professed as Sister Agnes Berchmans at the turn of the century. There are two of her paintings in the hotel, the large mural, and smaller one located in the Georgian Lounge. The gold leaf lobby ceiling is copied from the ceiling in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and was hand-finished by an Italian craftsman. There are floral and other motifs on the inverted sections, with the C.P. Railways logo among them. The lobby is 80 feet by 40 feet, and the Georgian Lounge is 60 feet by 28 feet. The original ballroom, which is called the Regency is 88 feet by 38 feet and still has the original hardwood floor and crystal chandeliers. The original section of the hotel had seven stories with 200 rooms. There have since been two additions, and the hotel now features 260 rooms. The 8th and 9th floors were added in 1966, and the North Tower section was added in 1975. The hotel helped make Spring Garden Road into a major shopping district. Spring Garden Road shops at the time of construction simply consisted of a beauty shop, a barber shop, and a large grill; a drug store now occupies the space that was once the grill. Cultural impact Actor Austin Willis and pianist Dick Fry perform from the CHNS Studio in the Lord Nelson Hotel, 1928 The Lord Nelson Hotel was named after England's greatest naval hero: Horatio Nelson. A young student, Oswald Schenk, won a contest for suggesting the name of the hotel. The hotel opened during the early days of radio and because of its height, CHNS, which began in 1926, moved its broadcast studio from the old Carleton Hotel to the roof of the new Lord Nelson in 1928.William March, 1986, Red Line: The Chronicle-Herald and The Mail-Star 1875-1954, Halifax: Chronicle Agencies Limited, p. 216 Nova Scotia Archives, Broadcasting from the Lord Nelson hotel, 1928 It inspired a critically acclaimed novel by Ray Smith called Lord Nelson Tavern, first published in 1974.Biblioasis, Lord Nelson Tavern The Lord Nelson also inspired the fictional hotel featured in the award-winning 1998 novel The Museum Guard by Howard Norman.

Leonard Hinder, better known by his pseudonym of Paul Leonard and also originally published as PJL Hinder, is an author best known for his work on various spin-off fiction based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Leonard has acknowledged a debt to his friend and fellow Doctor Who author Jim Mortimore in his writing career, having turned to Mortimore for help and advice at the start of it. This advice led to his first novel, Venusian Lullaby being published as part of Virgin Publishing's Missing Adventures range in 1994. Virgin published three more of his novels before losing their licence to publish Doctor Who fiction: Dancing the Code (1995); Speed of Flight (1996) and (as part of their New Adventures range) Toy Soldiers (1995). Following the loss of their licence, Virgin also published the novel Dry Pilgrimage (co-written with Nick Walters) in 1998 as part of their Bernice Summerfield range of novels. Leonard also wrote for the fourth volume of Virgin's Decalog short story collections. Following this, he was asked to co-edit the fifth volume of the collection with mentor Jim Mortimore. Leonard's experience in writing for Doctor Who led to him being asked to write one of the first novels in BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures series, the novel Genocide. This led to four further novels for the range, of which The Turing Test received particular acclaim for its evocative use of real-life historical characters and first person narrative. Leonard has also written short stories for the BBC Short Trips and Big Finish Short Trips collections.

He won key victories against the Parthians which resulted in the deaths of key leaders ‚Äì victories which redeemed the losses of Crassus and paved the way for Antony's incursions. According to Plutarch in his \\"Life of Antony\\", the three military victories of Ventidius over the Parthians singularly resulted in the only award (up to the time of Plutarch's writing) to a Roman general of the triumphal ceremony for victory over Parthians. History Ventidius was from Picenum. He and his mother were captured during the Social War, and both were marched as prisoners in Pompey Strabo's triumph through the streets of Rome. He was forced to work as a muleteer and quickly saw the Roman Army as his path to advancement. Ventidius attracted Caesar's notice during the Gallic Wars, and while he does not receive mention in Caesar's commentaries, he did execute Caesar's orders with ability during Caesar's civil war, and became one of Caesar's favorites. Ventidius chose to stand back during the early stages of Mark Antony's struggle with Octavian, eventually throwing his lot in with Antony. After the formation of the Second Triumvirate, Ventidius was appointed suffect consul. During Antony's absence in Egypt in 41 BC, Ventidius did nothing to support Antony's brother Lucius Antonius or Antony's wife Fulvia during their struggle with Octavian. After Antony had come to an agreement with Octavian off of Cape Misenum (probably in August 39), he sent Ventidius with several legions in response to a Parthian invasion launched in 40 BC. Ventidius' first major success came when he defeated Quintus Labienus and Phranipates (the best of King Orodes' military commanders) at the Battle of the Cilician Gates and the Amanus Pass. After hearing of the battles while in Athens, Antony put on a public feast in the town, then proceeded to the Levant to join him. Despite this setback, the Parthians launched another invasion into Syria led by Pacorus, the son of King Orodes. Ventidius met Pacorus' huge army in the Battle of Cyrrhestica where he inflicted an overwhelming defeat which resulted in the death of Pacorus. This victory was the culmination of Ventidius' campaigns, which confined the Parthians within Media (Medes) and Mesopotamia, and psychologically avenged the losses of Crassus, particularly at Carrhae. Ventidius could have pursued the Parthians even further: but, according to Plutarch, Ventidius had concerns regarding the possible jealousy of Antony; and, he preferred to subdue those who had rebelled against Roman authority to pursuing the Parthians with his forces. One such rebel was Antiochus of Commagene, whom he besieged in Samosata. Antiochus tried to make peace with Ventidius, but Ventidius told him to approach Antony directly. Wanting some of the glory for himself, Antony would not allow a treaty and proceeded to take over the siege. Antony's siege proved to be less effective than Ventidius', and Antony made peace. Whereas the treaty Antiochus originally offered Ventidius contained an indemnity of 1,000 talents, the final treaty with Antony had an indemnity of only 300 talents. After peace was concluded, Antony sent Ventidius back to Rome where he celebrated a triumph, the first Roman to triumph over the Parthians. After celebrating his triumph, Ventidius isn't mentioned again. In Shakespeare Ventidius appears briefly in Shakespeare's play Antony and Cleopatra, where he is shown leading the Roman forces against Parthia. He muses over whether to risk rousing his superior's jealousy by going further than he has; after which he disappears from the play.

The Hotel Saskatchewan was the fourteenth hotel in a nationwide chain constructed and owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway's earlier hotels, such as the Ch√¢teau Frontenac in Quebec City, the Chateau Lake Louise and the Banff Springs Hotel were designed in a distinctive ch√¢teau style, but by the late 1920s this had been abandoned in favor of a much simpler and less expensive style although the Canadian National Railway's Bessborough hotel in Saskatoon was built from 1928 to 1932. The Hotel Saskatchewan was the hub of the city's social life, and today operates as part of the Marriott International chain. Hotel Saskatchewan, circa 1930 Artistic rendering of the planned and partially constructed Chateau Qu'Appelle History Postcard of the building-in-progress Chateau Qu'Appelle published and distributed in or about 1913 Hotel Saskatchewan under construction 1925 A prior attempt at construction of a grand railway hotel for Regina, the Chateau Qu'Appelle, failed when the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway went bankrupt. The partially constructed Chateau Qu'Appelle‚Äînow the site of the Royal Saskatchewan Museum on the corner of Albert Street and College Avenue‚Äîremained derelict for some years until Canadian Pacific purchased the disused girders for use in the construction of the Hotel Saskatchewan and the large excavation was finally filled. The foundations remained in the ground, however, substantially accounting for the positioning of the Provincial Museum (now the Royal Saskatchewan Museum) at the corner of College Avenue and Albert Street but diagonally and substantially back from the streets. It is of course uncertain that if the Chateau Qu'Appelle had successfully been completed it would remain standing, but comparable palatial railway hotels in Quebec City, Montreal, Toronto, Saskatoon, Banff Springs, Vancouver, Victoria, BC and elsewhere remain standing and thriving. The hotel's opening in 1927 meant that Government House was no longer needed to accommodate official guests as it had previously done for visitors such as the future King George V and Queen Mary, who visited the then-Territories in 1901 as Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York; Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, his wife and their daughter Princess Patricia in 1912, the Prince of Wales in 1927. On February 19, 2014, Winnipeg- based Temple Hotels, owners of Moose Jaw's Temple Gardens, Saskatoon Inn and Regina's Wingate hotel, announced it would purchase Hotel Saskatchewan for $32.8 million and would undertake a three-year $6 million improvement campaign.

The 1992 treaty aims to protect the European archaeological heritage \\"as a source of European collective memory and as an instrument for historical and scientific study\\". All remains and objects and any other traces of humankind from past times are considered to be elements of the archaeological heritage. The archaeological heritage shall include structures, constructions, groups of buildings, developed sites, moveable objects, monuments of other kinds as well as their context, whether situated on land or under water.\\" (Art. 1) The Valletta Convention is an international legally binding treaty within Europe. It places the revised Convention in the framework of activities of the Council of Europe concerning the cultural heritage since the European Cultural Convention came into force. It deals with the protection, preservation and scientific research of archaeological heritage in Europe. In particular, the revised Convention focuses on the problem of conservation of archaeological heritage in the face of development projects. Other threats to the archaeological heritage are: *Natural disasters *Illicit and unscientific excavations *Lack of public awareness In accordance with the Preamble, objectives of the revised Convention are: *To integrate the conservation and archaeological investigation of archaeological heritage in urban and regional planning policies; *To establish a co-operation and consultation processes between archaeologists, and project developers; *To set standards for funding and archaeological and conservational methods used in studying the ‚Äúknowledge of the history of mankind‚Äù; *To promote educational actions and public awareness of the necessity of the protection and investigation of archaeological heritage in Europe; and *To foster international co-operation and joint action among all European countries in the field of archaeological resource management by means of developing and exchanging relevant scientific information, technologies and expertise. Definition of the archaeological heritage In Article 1 of the revised Convention archaeological heritage is defined. The article aims to emphasise the importance of both protection and scientific investigation of archaeological heritage as \\"a source of the European collective memory\\". Considering the ICOMOS Charter for the Protection and Management of the Archaeological Heritage 1990, \\"archaeological knowledge is based principally on the scientific investigation of the archaeological heritage\\". Consequentially, destructive as well as non-destructive scientific methods can be carried out with the provision that an excavation is seen as an ultima ratio to gain knowledge about the archaeological heritage of Europe. An element of archaeological heritage is given if there is any trace of human existence of the past displaying an interaction with the natural environment and enhancing our knowledge of the history of human kind, which was discovered by archaeological techniques. Therefore, not only artefacts of an archaeological site are of value but \\"all remains and objects and any other traces of mankind\\". Furthermore, the article gives examples of elements that are included in its concept of archaeological heritage: *Immovable objects: Structures, walls, groups of buildings, sites, monuments, burials etc. *Movable objects: Sculptures, artefacts, etc. *The context (land or sea) Identification of the heritage and measures for protection=Article 2 States parties to the revised Convention shall: *‚ÄúInstitute a legal system for the protection of the archaeological heritage‚Äù, which shall contain the following provisions: *‚ÄúMaintain an inventory of its archaeological heritage and designate protected monuments and areas\\", which activities are allowed in a protected area are left to the States party; *‚ÄúCreate archaeological reserves\\" designating zoning areas, in which forms of land use, e.g. disturbance of the soil, and excavations are restricted and supervised by the relevant authorities; and *Implement a \\"mandatory reporting to the competent authorities\\" for a finder of a \\"chance discovery of elements of the archaeological heritage\\". Article 3 Whether on public or private land, each Party agrees to establish a certain code of conduct of archaeological work and preservation methods. Article 3, paragraph i states that each Party needs to implement a controlled procedure of archaeological activities preventing ‚Äúany illicit excavation or removal of elements of the archaeological heritage‚Äù and assuring that archaeological resource management is applied in a scientific way. That principle includes that every investigation shall be as minimal as possible in its impact and uncovered findings are proper conserved during or after excavation. Excavations must be under the control of qualified, specially authorised persons (see Art. 3, para ii). In addition, \\"the use of metal detectors and any other detection equipment must be subject to specific prior authorization\\" (see Art. 3, para ii). Otherwise the arbitrary use of such equipment leads to destruction of context by digging up anything that the machine registers without knowing what it actually is. Integrated conservation of the archaeological heritage Article 5 deals with the relationship between the preservation of archaeological heritage and development projects. Each Party agrees to involve archaeologists in the complete planning policy (Art. 5, para. i). For example, archaeological sites and their settings shall be considered if environmental impact assessments are required (Art. 5, para. vi). It is essential that \\"archaeologists, town and regional planners systematically consult one another\\" (Art. 5, para. iii) to modify development plans that may have an adverse effect on archaeological heritage (para. iv), saving a considerable amount of time and money. The consultation process can only be successful, if the State parties make \\"relevant surveys, inventories and maps of archaeological sites\\" (Art. 7, para. i) available. Though damage will be caused to some archaeological heritage, important projects are implemented anyway. In that case, emergency excavations should be carried out; and it is necessary that States ensure \\"sufficient time and resources for an appropriate scientific study of the site\\" and the publication of its findings are allocated. Article 6 of the revised Convention gives details about the source of funds for archaeological research and rescue archaeology. If excavation works discover elements of archaeological heritage during a project, Article 5, paragraph vii makes provisions for ‚Äúconservation in situ when feasible\\". However, that paragraph does not say how this will be done. An option may be to excavate the site and conserve the remains with soil or a special covering afterwards, so that the construction can occur on top of it. The site and its elements are thus partially or fully available for potential investigations in the future. Financing of archaeological research and conservation States are required to arrange public, either on local, regional or national level, financial support for archaeological research. In addition, and that is important, the actor, either public or private, who is responsible for the concerning development project, has the obligation to allocate funding of any necessary related archaeological activities, such as rescue excavations (Art. 6, para. ii). This means, that public or private development plans should provide funds in the budget for archaeological survey work and full recording and publication of the findings in the same way that provision is made for environmental impact studies (Art. 6, para. ii b). Control of the application of the (revised) Convention As compliance mechanism the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe set up a committee of experts to monitor the implementation and application of the revised Convention (Art. 13). This monitoring includes: periodic reports on the situation of archaeological heritage protection policies and the realisation of the Convention‚Äôs principles in the States (Art. 13, para. i). The reports and any other recommendations or proposals are directed to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. Furthermore, the committee of experts may propose measures to improve the implementation of the revised Convention by recommendations for amendments, multilateral activities, informing the public (Art. 13, para. ii), or invitations to other States to accede to this Convention (Art. 13, para. iii). Signatures and ratifications Every State party that is consent to be bound by an international treaty needs to follow a procedure so the treaty can come into effect on the national and international level: *Signature *Ratification/Acceptance/Approval *Deposition of the Ratification Document *Entry into Force The European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (revised) is \\"open for signature by the member States of the Council of Europe and the other States party to the European Cultural Convention. It is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval\\" (Art. 14, para. 1). Before or simultaneously depositing the ratification to the revised Convention, the State party must denounce The European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage of 1969 (Art. 14, para. 2). The revised Convention shall enter into force six months after the date of the deposit of the instrument of ratification by any signatory State (Art. 14, para. 5). In the process of signing or ratifying the treaty, States may specify/limit the territory to which this revised Convention shall apply (Art. 16). Every State party can denounce the revised Convention by notification to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe (Art. 17). As of 2018, the convention has been ratified by 46 states, which includes 44 Council of Europe member states plus the Holy See. The last signatory to ratify the convention was Luxembourg in 2017. The two Council of Europe states that have not signed or ratified the convention are Iceland and Montenegro.

The tale was first published on 2 October 1838 as the first installment in Andersen's Fairy Tales Told for Children by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark. It has been adapted to various media including ballet, television, and film. It is categorized as an Aarne-Thompson type 451 (\\"The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds\\"). Other type 451 variants include such as The Twelve Brothers, The Six Swans, The Seven Ravens, The Twelve Wild Ducks and Udea and her Seven Brothers. Synopsis Illustration from 'the book Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen, London: Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle, 1872 In a faraway kingdom, there lives a widowed king with his twelve children: eleven princes and one princess. One day, he decides to remarry, but marries a wicked queen who is a witch. Out of spite, the queen turns her eleven stepsons into swans (they are allowed to become human by night) and forces them to fly away. The queen then tries to bewitch their 15-year-old sister Elisa, but Elisa's goodness is too strong for this, so the queen has her banished. The brothers carry Elisa to safety in a foreign land where she is out of the reach of her evil stepmother. There, Elisa is guided by the queen of the fairies to gather stinging nettles in graveyards to knit into shirts that will eventually help her brothers regain their human shapes. Elisa endures painfully blistered hands from nettle stings, and she must also take a vow of silence for the duration of her task, for speaking one word will kill her brothers. The king of another faraway land happens to come across the mute Elisa and falls in love with her. He grants her a room in his castle where she continues her knitting. Eventually he proposes to crown her as his queen and wife, and she accepts. However, the Archbishop is chagrined because he thinks Elisa is herself a witch, but the king will not believe him. One night Elisa runs out of nettles and is forced to collect more in a nearby church graveyard where the Archbishop is watching. Ghoulish spirits that devour the bodies of the dead are also in the churchyard, and the archbishop believes that Elisa is in league with them. He reports the incident to the king as proof of witchcraft. The statues of the saints shake their heads in protest, but the Archbishop misinterprets this sign as confirmation of Elisa's guilt. The Archbishop orders Elisa put on trial for witchcraft. She can speak no word in her defense, and is sentenced to death by burning at the stake. The brothers discover Elisa's plight and try to speak to the king but fail, thwarted by the rising sun. Even as the tumbril bears Elisa away to execution, she continues knitting, determined to continue up to the last moment of her life. This enrages the people, who are on the brink of snatching and destroying the shirts when the swans descend and rescue Elisa. The people interpret this as a sign from Heaven that Elisa is innocent, but the executioner still prepares for the burning. When Elisa throws the shirts over the swans, her brothers return to their human forms (unfortunately, the youngest brother has a swan's wing instead of an arm, as Elisa did not have time to finish one sleeve of his shirt). Elisa is now free to speak and tell the truth but faints from exhaustion, so her brothers explain. As they do so, the firewood around Elisa's stake miraculously takes root and bursts into flowers. The king plucks the topmost flower and places it on Elisa's chest. She is revived by the white flower, and the king and Elisa are married.

He was born in Graz and was educated at a Jesuit school in Feldkirch and also in Munich, Dresden and Graz before studying law, philosophy and political science at the university of Vienna. He soon turned his energies to music and attended the composition classes of Felix Otto Dessoff until 1864. Early on he was attracted to the music of Richard Wagner, but after studying J. S. Bach's works he became an adherent of the classical tradition and an advocate for the music of Brahms. In 1866 he married Elisabet von Stockhausen, who had been a piano pupil of Brahms; Brahms's letters to and from both Herzogenbergs form one of the most delightful sections of his correspondence. They lived in Graz until 1872, when they moved to Leipzig. In 1874, with the Bach scholar Philipp Spitta, Herzogenberg founded the Leipzig Bach-Verein, which concerned itself with the revival of Bach‚Äôs cantatas. Herzogenberg was its artistic director for ten years, during which time Ethel Smyth was one of his composition pupils. From 1885 he was Professor of Composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin. It was in this capacity that he advised the young Ralph Vaughan Williams to study with Max Bruch. He died suddenly in Wiesbaden, aged 57; in his last years he used a wheelchair due to necrosis of the joints. Herzogenberg was a well- schooled composer of definite gifts. In 1876 he wrote a set of Variations on a theme of Brahms (his op.23, for piano four hands, on the Brahms song, Die Trauernde, op.7 no.5), but despite Elisabet‚Äôs cajoling Brahms almost never expressed approval of his works. It has been suggested that Brahms was piqued that Herzogenberg had married Elisabet, of whom he was himself extremely fond. Toward the end of his life, Brahms grudgingly relented somewhat, writing ‚ÄúHerzogenberg is able to do more than any of the others.‚Äù While Herzogenberg has been characterized as a mere epigone of Brahms, many of his compositions show little or no overt Brahmsian influence. For example his two string trios Op.27 Nos. 1 & 2, while some early compositions pre-dating his acquaintance with Brahms have features in common with the older composer. Towards the end of his life he concentrated on providing music for communal worship in the Lutheran Evangelical Church in Strasbourg, under the influence of Friedrich Spitta, brother of Philipp Spitta, who was professor of theology there, though Herzogenberg himself remained Roman Catholic. His models in these pieces were the Bach oratorios and passions, with chorales designed to be sung by the congregation and played by only a small instrumental ensemble. He also wrote a large-scale Mass in memory of Philipp Spitta, for which Friedrich Spitta selected the text. Several of Herzogenberg‚Äôs major works were thought to have been destroyed during World War II but resurfaced during the 1990s.

The range lies to the south and west of the Alas River that flows east from the Gayo highlands of central Aceh before turning south through Karo Batak country in North Sumatra province. The Leuser region is of ancient uplifted formations - it is non-volcanic. The region is billed as the largest wilderness area in South-East Asia. It is often assumed, incorrectly, that the highest peak is Mount Leuser when in fact it is Mount Tanpa Nama. Mount Leuser is the lowest of the three peaks.

The mountain has two knolls: a painted sign on the lower knoll (3,455 m, 11,335 ft) reads ‚ÄúPuncak Tanpa Nama‚Äù (summit of Mount Tanpa Nama). On the higher, more prominent knoll to the north-east, the true summit, a plaque embedded in a cement block reads, ‚ÄúProf Dr Syamsuddin Mahmud, Governor Aceh, 1997 ...‚Äù. The name, Mount Tanpa Nama, is used in the absence of a formally recognised name. BAKOSURTANAL does not attribute a name to this peak on its 1977 map series; only the altitude of the lower knoll is indicated. A formal name may appear if and when BASKOSURTANAL issues new topographical maps of Sumatra.  Mounts Loser and Leuser  Mounts Loser and Leuser, by comparison with Mount Tanpa Nama, rise from the east with precipitous drop- offs on their western faces over the rugged escarpment towards the west coast of Aceh. Most trekkers set Mount Loser as their objective being the higher and more accessible of the two peaks. The origin of the names, Loser and Leuser, are obscure.

Local folk lorePers Com., Mr. Rajajalli, guide/operator, Rain Forest Lodge, Kedah, www.gunung-leuser-trek.net provides a not-unrelated story: a Dutch officer was hunting deer on the Leuser Range in colonial times and accidentally shot his hunting partner on the Loser peak.

The Act creates a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature. Provisions The Act has the following provisions: *creates an executive body‚Äîthe Welsh Assembly Government (known since May 2011 as the Welsh Government)‚Äîthat is separate from the legislative body, that is, the National Assembly for Wales. The Welsh Government is therefore altered from being a committee of the National Assembly to being a distinct body *forbids candidates both contesting constituencies and being on a regional list *provides a mechanism for Orders in Council to delegate power from Parliament to the Assembly, which will give the Assembly powers to make \\"Measures\\" (Welsh Laws). Schedule 5 of the Act describes the fields in which the assembly has Measure making powers. *provides for a referendum for further legislature competencies, to be known as \\"Acts of the Assembly\\" *creates a Welsh Seal and a Keeper of the Welsh Seal (the First Minister) *creates a Welsh Consolidated Fund *creates the post of Counsel General as a member of the Welsh Government and its chief legal adviser. *assigns to the Queen new functions of formally appointing Welsh ministers and granting royal assent to Acts of the Assembly. The bill received Royal assent on 25 July 2006. Schedule 5 of the Act Schedule 5 of the Act describes the 20 \\"Fields\\" and \\"Matters\\" in which the National Assembly for Wales has Legislative competence i.e. the ability to pass Assembly Measures (or, since 2011, Acts). A Field is a broad subject area, such as education and training, the environment, health and health services, highways and transport, or housing. A Matter is a specific defined policy area within a Field. The Assembly can gain further legislative competence by the amendment of Schedule 5. There are two ways in which this can happen: either as a result of clauses included in legislation passed by an Act of Parliament at Westminster, or by Legislative Competency Orders (LCOs) granted by Parliament in response to a request from the National Assembly itself (LCOs may be proposed by the Welsh Government, or by individual members, or by Assembly Committees, but must be approved by the National Assembly before they can go forward). The result of either method is to amend any of the 20 Fields by inserting specific Matters. The Assembly then has competence to pass legislation on those Matters. Schedule 5 is regularly updated as result of these two processes. An up-to- date version of the Schedule (which also indicates where amendments are proposed) is available on the National Assembly's website.Schedule 5  NAFW . Assemblywales.org.

It began in the early ninth century as the local community began to grow autonomous as Byzantine power lagged in the Mediterranean and the peninsula due to Lombard and Saracen incursions. The primary source for the history of Gaeta during its ducal period is the Codex Caietanus, a collection of charters preserving Gaetan history better and in greater detail than that of its neighbouring coastal states: Naples, Amalfi, and Sorrento. In 778, it was the headquarters from which the patrician of Sicily directed the campaign against the Saracen invaders of Campania. Rise of the Docibilans The square tower of the Castle of Itri, attributed to Docibilis I. The first consul of Gaeta, Constantine, who associated his son Marinus with him, was a Byzantine agent and a vassal of Andrew II of Naples. Constantine defended the city from the ravages of Muslim pirates and fortified it, building outlying castles as well. He was removed, probably violently, by the Docibilis I, who established a dynasty and made Gaeta de facto independent. The Docibilian dynasts regularly worked to advance Gaetan interests through alliance with whatever power was most capable of such at the time. They joined forces with the Saracens against their Christian neighboursPatricia Skinner (1995), Family Power in Southern Italy: The Duchy of Gaeta and its Neighbours, 850-1139 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 2-3. and with the Pope against the Muslim pirates at the Battle of Ostia. They constructed a massive palace and greatly increased the city's prestige and wealth. The Gaetans remained nominally Byzantine in allegiance until the mid tenth century, fighting under their banner at the Battle of the Garigliano. The chief success of the Docibilians lay, however, in extracting Gaeta from the Ducatus Neapolitanus. It was Docibilis II (died 954) who first took the title of dux or duke (933). Docibilis saw Gaeta at its zenith but began the process whereby it was chiefly weakened. He gave Fondi to his second son Marinus with the equivalent title of duke and set a precedent for the partitioning of the Gaetan duchy and its encastellation, which corroded ducal authority over time. Decline of ducal power In 962, Gaeta put itself under Pandulf Ironhead, the Lombard prince of Capua. In 963, however, only the municipal rulers appeared in the charters. In 976, the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto II, and the pope were the recognised suzerains of Gaeta. A complete revolution had occurred since the assumption of the ducal title and the Western Emperor had replaced the Eastern as overlord. Gaeta declined in importance in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. In 1012, a succession crisis weakened it further. John IV died, leaving one son by his wife Sichelgaita, a sister of Sergius IV of Naples. This son, John V, ruled under the disputed regency of his grandmother Emilia. His uncle Leo I usurped the duchy only to be removed in a few short months and his other uncle, Leo II, fought over the regency with Emilia. It wasn't until 1025 that the situation was settled. After that, John V sheltered the fleeing Sergius of Naples and aided him in retaking his city with Norman assistance. For this, John V earned the enmity of Pandulf IV of Capua and his duchy was conquered in 1032. The local dynasty, descended from Docibilis, would never recover its duchy. Lombard period Gaeta was conquered by the Lombards in 1032. In 1038, the conqueror, Pandulf of Capua, was deposed and replaced by Guaimar IV of Salerno. Guaimar did not reign personally for long before appointing the chiefest of his Norman mercenaries, Ranulf Drengot, as duke. On Ranulf's death, however, the Gaetans elected their own Lombard candidate, Atenulf, Count of Aquino. Under Atenulf and his son, Atenulf II, Gaeta remained practically independent, but Richard I of Capua and his son Jordan subjugated it in 1058 and then again in 1062. In 1064, the Lombard ruler was expelled and a Norman, William of Montreuil, took his place and married the Lombard widow of Atenulf I, Maria, daughter of Pandulf. The place of women in the rule of Gaeta was significant. Norman period The Norman overlords of Gaeta appointed dukes from various families of local prominence, Normans mostly, until 1140, when the last Gaetan duke died, leaving the city to the king of Sicily, Roger II, to whom he had pledged himself in 1135. The first Norman duke after the brief tenure of Ranulf Drengot under Guaimar was William of Montreuil, appointed in 1064. He tried to legitimise his rule by marriage to the widow of his Lombard predecessor, but after his expulsion by his Norman overlord, the prince of Capua, Richard I, it was not necessary for any subsequent dukes to legitimise themselves: the Normans had established their power. From 1067 or 1068 to 1091, Gaeta was ruled by the Norman Ridello family. Their power was set in Gaeta and Geoffrey Ridello ruled from Pontecorvo, but the Gaetans were not completely weaned from their independent past yet. On the death of Jordan I of Capua, Gaeta rebelled against Norman rule and set up as their duke one Landulf. He ruled successfully until 1103, because the Norman prince of Capua, Richard II, was exiled from his capital. In 1103, William Blosseville conquered the city and in turn was conquered by Richard of Aquila in 1105. Richard was a de facto independent duke as were his successors. The death of Jordan I had sapped the Norman dynasty of Capua of its authority and this had a great effect on Gaeta. After Richard's death (1111), Gaeta was ruled by Andrew Dell'Aquila until 1113, when Richard of Caleno got it. Finally, in 1135, Richard of Caleno was forced to make submission to King Roger, who had forced the last prince of Capua, Robert II, to make submission the same year. Economy The city of Gaeta was always the economic, political, and ecclesiastical centre of the duchy. The probable origins of the Docibilan dynasty as Amalfitan merchants perhaps explains the interest they had in amassing movable as well as landed wealth. The Gaetan forum (market) was located near the ducal palace. Warehouses (medialocae), some even owned by foreigners, like Pisans, were commonplace.Medialoca was Latin for \\"middle place\\" and probably indicated the middle storey of a three- floor structure, where the ground and top floors were open shops and living quarters, respectively, c.f. Patricia Skinner (1995), \\"Politics and Piracy: the Duchy of Gaeta in the Twelfth Century,\\" Journal of Medieval History, 21, 309. In the tenth century Gaetans, Amalfitans, and Salernitans were present cum magno negotio (\\"with great business\\") in Pavia. At Constantinople the Gaetans had a colony. Liutprand of Cremona even records that the deposers of Romanus II claimed the support of the \\"men of Caieta\\" and Amalfi. While it is known that Amalfi imported Byzantine silk, a single reference to \\"Gaetan silk\\" in a will of 1028 suggests that Gaeta may have been involved in its production.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 310. A cloak bearing an eagle, a common imperial symbol, mentioned in this same will may indicate the presence of Byzantine textiles industry in Gaeta. By 1129 the Jewish community at Gaeta was heavily involved in the industries of cloth-dyeing, salt extraction, and olive oil production.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 314. The replacement of the Docibilan dynasty in the mid-eleventh century caused a municipal power shift which had implications for trade and commerce. The established nobility, whose wealth was based on land, was displaced by the families of the rising merchant class, whose new wealth was got by trade. These new families had established ties with Ptolemy I of Tusculum by 1105. The Crescentii, the traditional rivals of the Tusculani in Rome, had taken over Terracina, formerly Gaetan territory, and were establishing martial ties with the Docibilans still ruling at Fondi in the late eleventh century. These two Roman families were soon vying for influence among the merchant clans of Gaeta; the Crescentii appeared to have had upper hand.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 311. In the twelfth century Gaetan trade expanded, while the duchy's Norman dukes took less interest in the city itself. In 1128 Gaeta is recorded as paying less, only twelve denarii, for docking a ship at Genoa than any other city (Amalfi, Naples, Rome, or Salerno), perhaps suggesting longstanding relations with Genoa.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 311, cites the Gaetan ship which attempted to transport a group of Cassinese monks to Sardinia in 1063 as the only prior evidence for a Gaetan relationship with Genoa, since the Genoese were in competition with the Pisans for control of Sardinia at that time. The Gaetan-Genoese relationship had deteriorated by 1140, when, according to Caffaro di Rustico: During the period of the consuls, Gaeta seems to have been heavily involved in piracy, if with little permanent success. The consuls are often recorded acting to restore merchandise to foreigners.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 316. There is reference to a war with the city of Salerno and to apparent commercial rivalry, resulting in piracy, with Atrani. Consulate In 1094 a major shift in the government of Gaeta was first recorded. In that year boni homines (\\"good men\\") first took part in the political process. In 1123 consuls, four in number, are first recorded, though the dukes had always borne the consular title as an imperial honorific.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 312. This makes Gaeta one of the \\"more precocious cities\\" by Daniel Waley's criteria.Daniel Waley (1978), The Italian City-Republics (London: Longman), 35. The use of consuls may have been the result of Genoese or Pisan influence, though consuls from Rome were recorded participating in Gaetan affairs in 1127.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 312, prefers the Genoese answer. The record of consular government in Gaeta lasts only until 1135. Two general factions can be defined: those families aligned with the Crescentii and those aligned with the Tusculani. The former dominated the consulate.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 314, provides a table of known consuls and their \\"factions\\". In 1123 Duke Richard II confirmed the copper coinage and promised the consuls not to change it. In 1127 the building that housed the curia he ceded to them.Skinner, \\"Politics and Piracy\\", 317. The submission in 1135 and death in 1140 of the last Gaetan duke correspond, respectively, with the last consular record and the failed attack on Genoa. It is probably that increased Norman oversight of Gaetan affairs is responsible for the eclipse of both the consuls and the pirates.

The city and its territory were originally part of the larger ducatus Neapolitanus, governed by a patrician, but it extracted itself from Byzantine vassalage and first elected a duke (or doge) in 958. During the 10th and 11th centuries Amalfi was estimated to have a population of 50,000‚Äì70,000 people. It rose to become an economic powerhouse, a commercial center whose merchants dominated Mediterranean and Italian trade in IX and X century, before being surpassed and superseded by the other maritime republics of the North, like Pisa, Venice, and Genoa. In 1073, Amalfi lost its independence, falling to Norman invasion and subsequently to Pisa in 1137. History The city of Amalfi was founded as a trading post in 339. Its first bishop was appointed in 596. In 838, the city was captured by Sicard of Benevento with help from traitors within the city, who led him in through the waterward defenses. Many of the Amalfitans in Salerno sacked that city and left. In 839, Amalfi freed itself from Lombard domination and elected a prefect. Nearby Atrani participated in these early prefectural elections. Subsequently, Amalfi helped to free Siconulf to oppose the ruling Prince of Benevento. In 897, the self-governing republic, still nominally tied to the Byzantine Empire, was defeated in a war with Sorrento, supported by Naples, in which her prefect was captured, later ransomed. In 914, the prefect Mastalus I was appointed first judge. In 903 the Amalfitans joined forces with Naples to attack the Arabs that had established themselves on the banks of the Garigliano river. However the combined forces of Amalfi and the Naples were driven back by the Arabs and their allies, the Italian city state of Gaeta. In 915 Amalfi did not join the Battle of Garigliano to fight against the Arabs. This was most likely due to the fact that since 909 Amalfi had been heavily trading with the Fatimid Caliphate and did not want to jeopardize relations with this powerful trade partner. In 958, Mastalus II was assassinated and Sergius I was elected first duke (or doge). From 981 to 983, Amalfi ruled the Principality of Salerno. In 987, the Amalfitan bishopric was raised to archiepiscopal status. From 1034, Amalfi came under the control of the Principality of Capua and, in 1039, that of Salerno. In 1073, Robert Guiscard conquered the city and took the title dux Amalfitanorum: \\"duke of the Amalfitans.\\" In 1096, Amalfi revolted, but this was put down in 1101. It revolted again in 1130 and was finally subdued in 1131, when the Emir John marched on Amalfi by land and George of Antioch blockaded the town by sea and set up a base on Capri. In 1135 and 1137, Pisa sacked the city and the glory of Amalfi was past. The Arab traveller Ibn Hawqal, writing in 977 during the great reign of Manso I, described Amalfi as: The title \\"Duke of Amalfi\\" was revived in the later 14th century as a title used within the Kingdom of Naples.  Importance  After the Amalfitans broke free of Lombard control they did not return to Neapolitan control but instead stated their independence. After 839 Amalfi was an independent entity and created a strong maritime presence. Amalfi had strong ties with both the Byzantine Empire ( a term used to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantium, or the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages) and the Fatimid Caliphate. The Amalfitans had a permanent and important presence in Constantinople during the 10th and 11th centuries. Amalfitans also created Latin Christian outposts in the Levant around 1040 and hostels for Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem and Antioch. During the 10th and 11th centuries Amalfi was dominating trade and commerce with North Africa and the Levant, and one of the major exports from Amalfi during the Middle Ages was the chestnut.  The legacy of the Duchy of Amalfi  Statute of Flavio Gioia in Amalfi by Alfonso Balzico, 1900While the Duchy of Amalfi never regained its independence after 1137, the city of Amalfi was still important to maritime trade for the next 200 years, until 1343, when an earthquake and a storm destroyed most of its harbor. The most important contribution Amalfi made during those 200 years was probably the perfection of the modern-day box compass. Between 1295 and 1302, Flavio Gioia turned the compass from a needle floating in water to what we use today, a round box with a compass card that rotates 360 degrees attached to a magnetic element.

Origin and early usage modern orthography), Irish for 'Dublin Brigade', a variant name for the Dublin Volunteer Brigade. The badge was designed in 1913 by Eoin MacNeill, a founding member and chairman of the Irish Volunteers.

It was governed by a military commander (dux), and rapidly became a de facto independent state, lasting more than five centuries during the Early and High Middle Ages. The modern city of Naples remains a significant region of Italy, today. First local duchy In 661, Naples obtained from the emperor Constans II the right to be ruled by a local duke, one Basil, whose subjection to the emperor soon became merely nominal. Among his titles were patrikios (\\"patrician\\") and hypatos (\\"consul\\"). At that time the Ducatus Neapolitanus controlled an area corresponding roughly to the present day Province of Naples, encompassing the area of Vesuvius, the Campi Flegrei, the Sorrentine Peninsula, Giugliano, Aversa, Afragola, Nola, and the islands of Ischia and Procida. Capri was later part of the duchy of Amalfi. He had authority over the neighbouring seaports of Gaeta, Amalfi, and Sorrento, though each of these was largely autonomous, especially during the later years of the Neapolitan duchy. In this era, the duchy coined monies with the effigy of the emperor and Greek inscriptions. Greek was the official language. Papal suzerainty In 763, the duke Stephen II switched his allegiance from Constantinople to Rome, putting Naples under papal suzerainty. Already during the reign of the imperially appointed John I (711- ca 719), the papacy had come to the duke's aid against the Lombards, while Byzantine assistance seemed remote. Stephen II's reign is considered a period of transition in the history of Naples: it moved away from the iconoclastic East and towards the papal West. The Byzantine Greeks were soon to become as much a threat to the Neapolitans as the Lombards. Sometime around the beginning of the ninth century, the dukes began striking coinage with Latin inscriptions, as Latin replaced Greek in official usage. Saint Januarius replaced the emperor on the coins. Acts were still dated by the imperial reign, but the emperor was of no consequence in regular Neapolitan affairs. In 813, when Leo V the Armenian called for the fleet of the entire ducatus to aid the Byzantine admiral in combating the Saracen pirates preying on Sicily, Duke Anthimus could ignore the order; only Amalfi and Gaeta responded with contingents. Apparently, the Neapolitans felt themselves practically independent already and their underlings felt themselves independent of Naples. The duchy was not yet hereditary; in 818, the patrician of Sicily appointed Theoctistus without imperial approval. He revoked this appointment, and appointed one Theodore II in 821, but he was chased from the city the same year in favour of the elected Stephen III. This Stephen first began to mint pieces with his own initials on them and not those of the Eastern Emperor. Hereditary duchy In 840, Duke Sergius I made the succession to the duchy hereditary, and thenceforth Naples was de facto independent. In this age, the city was mainly a military centre, ruled by an aristocracy of warriors and landowners, even though it had been compelled to surrender to the neighbouring Lombards much of its inland territory. Naples was not a merchant city as other Campanian sea cities like Amalfi and Gaeta, but had a respectable fleet who took part in the Battle of Ostia against the Saracens in 849. Anyway, Naples did not hesitate to ally with infidels if this turned to its advantage: in 836, for example, it asked support to the Saracens in order to push off the siege of Lombard troops coming from the neighbouring Duchy of Benevento. After its dukes rose to highest prominence under the Duke-Bishop Athanasius and his successors--of whom Gregory IV and John II participated at the Battle of the Garigliano in 915--Naples declined in importance in the tenth century, until it was captured by its traditional rival, Pandulf IV of Capua. Struggles for relevance in the Norman South In 1027, duke Sergius IV donated the county of Aversa to a band of Norman mercenaries led by Rainulf Drengot, whose support he had needed in the war with the principality of Capua. In that period he could not imagine the consequences, but this settlement began a process which eventually led to the end of Naples' independence itself. Sergius cemented his position with marital alliances with the Normans, but when these broke down, he was abandoned by his mercenaries and retired to a monastery. His son, John V, cosied up to Guaimar IV of Salerno and eventually did homage to him. Naples was the last of the southern Italian states which the Normans had met when they first entered Italy. It survived the fall of the Lombard principalities: Capua, Salerno, Benevento. It had survived the fall of its fellow Greek duchies: Amalfi, Gaeta, Sorrento. In 1137, Duke Sergius VII was forced to surrender to Roger II of Sicily, who had had himself proclaimed King of Sicily seven years earlier. Under the new rulers the city was administrated by a compalazzo (palatine count), with little independence left to the Neapolitan patriciate. In this period Naples had a population of 30,000 and yet got its sustenance from the inland country: commerce activities were mainly delegated to foreign people, mainly from Pisa and Genova. Apart from the church of San Giovanni a Mare, Norman buildings in Naples were mainly lay ones, notably castles (Castel Capuano and Castel dell'Ovo), walls and fortified gates.

According to the Puranas, he was born in the most fearless Andhaka clan of the mighty Yadavas, and son of H≈óidika.Pargiter, F.E. (1972). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.105. Analysis As is typical with the characters in the Mahabharata, Kritavarma is juxtaposed with Satyaki. Unlike the more hotheaded, independent-thinking Satyaki, Kritavarma is more subdued and traditional. When Satyaki breaks bonds with the Narayani army, holding his ties to his teacher Arjuna and his relative Krishna, as well as the righteousness of the Pandava cause, over his loyalty to the army (sworn to Duryodhana), Kritavarma fights for the Kauravas, since Krishna had promised Duryodhan that his Narayani army will fight for Kauravas . Throughout the war, Kritavarma takes part in many acts. He engages in the killing of Abhimanyu (his own student), he checks Bhima's advance on the 14th day, and defends Jayadratha against Arjuna. He also does not protest when Ashwatthama proposes they kill the Pandavas in their sleep. Far from being morally accepting of such acts, Kritavarma is portrayed as a very dutiful soldier. What his senior officer commands, he will execute without failure.http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/mahabharata-bori.html See also *Ashwatthama *Bhagavata Purana *Kripacharya *Krishna *MahƒÅbhƒÅrata *Syamantaka *Vishnu Purana ReferencesExternal links *Yadu genealogy *Mahabharata translated by C Rajagopalachari *Srimad Bhagavatam *Vishnu Purana Category:Characters in the Mahabharata ","title":"Kritavarma"},{"id":"3761573","text":"ParamƒÅrtha (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§• ParamƒÅrtha; ) (499-569 CE) was an Indian monk from Ujjain in central India, who is best known for his prolific Chinese translations which include Vasubandhu's Abhidharmako≈õa. ParamƒÅrtha is considered one of the greatest translators of sutras in Chinese Buddhism, along with KumƒÅrajƒ´va and Xuanzang. Biography Typical countryside of the Malwa region in India Emperor Wu of Liang was ParamƒÅrtha's patron in China ParamƒÅrtha was born in 499 CE in the autonomous kingdom of Malwa in central India, at the end of the Gupta Dynasty. His given name was KulanƒÅtha, meaning \\"savior of the family\\", and his parents were Brahmins belonging to the BhƒÅradvƒÅja clan. His Buddhist name of ParamƒÅrtha means \\"the ultimate meaning,\\" parama: uppermost, artha: meaning. In the Buddhist context, this refers to the absolute, as opposed to merely conventional truth. ParamƒÅrtha became a Buddhist monk in India and received support from royalty for his travels to spread the teachings of Buddhism. He most likely received royal patronage from BƒÅlƒÅditya II or KumƒÅragupta III. The Maukhari ruler Dhruvasena I may have also supported ParamƒÅrtha, as his kingdom was a well-known bastion of the type of YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings advocated by ParamƒÅrtha. The first destination of ParamƒÅrtha was the kingdom of Funan, or pre-Angkor Cambodia. Here in Funan, ParamƒÅrtha's reputation grew to the extent that Emperor Wu of Liang sent ambassadors to bring ParamƒÅrtha to the Chinese imperial court. ParamƒÅrtha arrived in China through Guangdong (then called Nanhai) on 25 September 546 CE.23 The conditions of Paramartha's arrival at the capital are described in a Chinese introduction written by Pao Kuei in 597 CE: In China, ParamƒÅrtha worked with a translation team of twenty accomplished monks. Paramartha's work was interrupted by political events and the general chaotic state of China during this period, which included the murder of Emperor Wu. Several years later, ParamƒÅrtha was able to continue translation efforts in earnest with his translation team, beginning with the Golden Light Sutra (Skt. Suvar·πáaprabhƒÅsa S≈´tra). During much of his later life, ParamƒÅrtha continued a pattern of continually translating texts while traveling from region to region in China. He also continued to review his older translations for any areas in which the words and the general meaning were in conflict. By 563 CE, Paramartha had won prominence throughout southern China and had acquired a supportive following of disciples, many of whom traveled great distance to hear his teachings, especially those from the MahƒÅyƒÅna Sa·πÉgraha. Despite his success in China, ParamƒÅrtha wished to return to India toward the end of his life, but felt that this journey back to the west would be \\"impossible.\\" Instead, he accepted the patronage of Ouyang Ho and continued his translation efforts at a rapid pace. In 569 CE, at the age of 70, he died, and a st≈´pa was built in his honor. ReferencesSources * Further reading * Boucher, Daniel, \\"Paramartha\\". In: Buswell, Robert E. ed. (2003).

History The school was officially opened on 26 March 1930 as the New Windsor Council School by Sir Charles Trevelyan, the President of the Board of Education. It was renamed Trevelyan School in his honour in 1954. Since 1979, it has been a co- educational comprehensive middle school, catering for pupils between the ages of nine and thirteen. In 1998, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead assumed responsibility for the school from the former Royal County of Berkshire Council. In 2002 the school moved from its Green Lane home for the previous 72 years to a new site in Wood Close. Classes and Houses Trevelyan Middle School has twenty classes of students, arranged in four year groups of five classes each. Year 5 is the youngest year group in the school, and year 8 the eldest. Students belong to one of the school's five houses: ARFAEST meaning Respectful (BLUE house) EADIG meaning Happy (GREEN house) TOETHIAN meaning Inspire (RED house) TILUNG meaning Nurture (YELLOW house) MERCIAN meaning Creativity (PURPLE house) Prefect System Lunchtime, break time and before school is overlooked by a team of numerous Prefects, 4 Senior Prefects, a Deputy Head Boy, a Deputy Head Girl, a Head Boy and a Head Girl, all from year 8.

Lauria had taken his fleet to Augusta, eastern Sicily, after a report of an Angevin galley fleet landing invasion troops there. He landed his troops, who recaptured the town, leaving the Angevins holed up in the castle. However, the invasion was a decoy and the Angevin galleys had sailed around the south of Sicily and linked up with their allies, forming a fleet about twice the size of Lauria's. Their plan was to land troops in the south-west of Sicily. Lauria searched for the allied fleet and finally found it at Naples. Unable to attack it close to the city, he bombarded the nearby coast to lure it out, as he had done in 1284, and sent in a formal challenge. The Angevin fleet came out arranged in five squadrons, each commanded by a count (hence the name of the battle). They were Reynald III Quarrel of Avella, Hugh of Brienne, the Count of Aquila, Count Jean de Joinville and Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola. Each of their flag-galleys was surrounded to each side by four other galleys and to the rear by two galleys. The fleet flag-galley had two galleys to its front also. This made 63 galleys, and there may have been a small reserve since about 70 of the about 84 Angevin galleys are said to have come out to fight. Two tarides carried the Papal and Angevin banners. Lauria had around 40-45 galleys. He followed his usual tactic and retreated until the Angevin galleys had become disorganized, weathered their initial attack, then counter attacked from the sides, damaging the Angevin galleys oars. In a battle lasting much of the day, Henry di Mari again fled, leaving about 40 Angevin galleys to be captured, along with 5,000 prisoners, including many counts and barons.

Unlike most such programs, which compress numerous files into a single archive for transmission, DiskDoubler was intended to compress single files \\"in place\\" to save space on the drive. When such a file was opened, DiskDoubler would decompress the file before handing it off to the application for use. A later addition, AutoDoubler, added background compression, finding and compressing files automatically when the computer was idle. DiskDoubler was created by Terry Morse and Lloyd Chambers, fellow employees at a small software firm that went out of business in 1989. Chambers had already released a version of the Unix Compress utility on the Mac as MacCompress, and while working on another \\"real\\" project, Chambers wrote DiskDoubler in his spare time. When demonstrating their new product at a local Mac store, they noticed that it was DiskDoubler that got all of the attention. It was first shown publicly at the San Francisco MacWorld Expo in April 1990 (normally in January, but delayed that year) and by the end of the show had sold 500 copies. By the summer they were selling 1000 copies a month. Realizing they needed real marketing muscle, they approached Symantec, who agreed to include it in their Symantec Utilities for Macintosh (SUM) package for a pittance. Unimpressed by the offer, they instead asked Guy Kawasaki to front them a $25,000 development loan, raised a similar amount on their own, and formed Salient Software. After four months sales were over $50,000 a month. When System 7 shipped in June 1991 sales took off, as the new system was rather hungry for drive space. The company was eventually sold to Fifth Generation Systems in 1992. They also repackaged it in a suite as SuperDoubler 4.0, including AutoDoubler, DiskDoubler, and a file-copy speedup known as CopyDoubler. For some time, DiskDoubler was the second-best selling product on the Mac, second only to After Dark, the popular screen saver. Fifth Generation was later sold, somewhat ironically, to Symantec, who re-released it as a fat binary as Norton DiskDoubler Pro 1.1. Symantec \\"sat\\" on the product and it slowly disappeared over the next year. DiskDoubler concentrated on speed, originally supporting only a single variety of the LZ78 compression algorithm used in Compress/MacCompress to avoid having to try different settings. Nevertheless, the compression results were quite reasonable, notably on text files. Better yet, DiskDoubler was extremely fast, generally twice as fast as StuffIt, and 50% faster than Compact Pro, the two main archivers in use on the Mac in the 1990s. DiskDoubler also had the capability of decompressing StuffIt and PackIt files, which it did much faster than those programs could. Over the years DiskDoubler eventually ended up with four different algorithms, typically using the fastest compressor, DD1, for a first pass, and then running the most effective, DD3+, when the machine was idle. DiD3+ provided the highest compression of any Mac-based compression software, using knowledge of specific file types to improve over a \\"generic\\" LZW scheme. Users typically interacted with DiskDoubler via an additional menu placed in the Macintosh Finder. Selecting a file, or group of them, the user selects \`Compress\` from the \`DD\` menu. The file in question is quickly compressed and replaced by a similar icon stamped with a small \\"DD\\" tag to indicate it was compressed. The original Classic Mac OS did not include any sort of composite icon support, so DiskDoubler had to copy and modify every icon it found and then hand those modified icons back to the Finder with a new file type. When a file was compressed, its (hidden) file type flag was changed to the one DiskDoubler \\"made up\\", making the Finder display the modified icon. AutoDoubler (AD) was a small software daemon for which speed was the main concern, since AD was intended to be used \\"invisibly\\". For this reason it first used the AD1/DD1 \\"fastest\\" method to compress as many files as possible as quickly as it could, and then when that was complete it would go back and re-compress with DD3+ if the machine was still idle. DD/AD was so invisible that it would compress anything outside the System folder, including applications and various resources. The main reason for better performance was the fact that compressing a file and writing it was faster than writing the original file as the bottleneck was to be found in hard disk I/O times. The same is correct for reading and decompressinga files. The product also included a freeware (but closed source) decompressor known as DDExpand. Since DiskDoubler was intended to compress \\"in place\\" and generally be invisible, most users set up DiskDoubler to decompress automatically when copying files to other media so that it would open fine on other people's machines. Additionally, since the program decompressed files as they were opened, the simple action of archiving files using another utility like StuffIt automatically decompressed the files before they were inserted into the new archive. For these reasons the DiskDoubler format was rarely seen \\"in the wild\\", and DDExpand was rarely needed. DiskDoubler did include an option for this, however, which would combine several files into one archive. These could sometimes be found in software libraries, but was generally frowned upon. DiskDoubler created a market for similar products. The first attempt to produce a similar product resulted in SuperDisk!, which, when released, was faster than DiskDoubler but offered less compression. SuperDisk! also offered \\"on the fly\\" compression, which DiskDoubler had not added at that point. An updated version of DiskDoubler fought back with a new compression scheme that ran entirely in the 256-byte cache of the 68020, which greatly improved performance. AutoDoubler was also included as a new feature. Now Software also introduced a product in this space called Now Compress. Aladdin Software eventually brought out their own solution as well, as StuffIt SpaceSaver. All of these products had a following during the era of small hard drives. Eventually, a combination of shrinking Mac marketshare, changes to the underlying filesystem and ever- increasing drive space killed off this product niche. With the introduction of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Apple introduced a similar technology known as Transparent Compression into HFS Plus.

Along with John Trenchard, he published The Independent Whig, which was a weekly periodical. From 1720 to 1723, Trenchard and Gordon wrote a series of 144 essays entitled Cato's Letters, condemning corruption and lack of morality within the British political system and warning against tyranny. The essays were published as Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious, at first in the London Journal and then in the British Journal. These essays became a cornerstone of the Commonwealth man tradition and were influential in shaping the ideas of the Country Party.Marie P. McMahon (1990). The radical Whigs, John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon: libertarian Loyalists to the new House of Hanover. His ideas played an important role in shaping republicanism in Britain and especially in the American colonies leading up to the American revolution. Zuckert argues, \\"The writers who, more than any others, put together the new synthesis that is the new republicanism were John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, writing in the early eighteenth century as Cato.\\" Life Portrait by Maria Verelst of Anne Blackett (d.1783), Mrs John Trenchard, later Mrs Thomas Gordon. He was born in Kirkcudbright towards the end of the seventeenth century. He possibly attended the University of Aberdeen. He went to London as a young man and taught languages. Two pamphlets on the Bangorian controversy commended him to John Trenchard, a Whig politician; one was probably A Letter to the Lord Archbishop (i.e. William Wake) in 1719, who had written a Latin letter reflecting upon Hoadly, addressed to the church of Zurich. Gordon became Trenchard's amanuensis. Robert Walpole made Gordon first commissioner of the wine licenses, a post which he held till his death on 28 July 1750. Gordon was twice married, his second wife being Trenchard's widow. Works A tract called the Independent Whig, published at the time of the rejection of the Peerage Bill (December 1719), was followed by a second part in January 1720, on the peace with Spain and the value of Gibraltar to England, several editions of which were issued. A weekly paper of the same name was then started, and carried on through the year, the articles by Trenchard, Gordon, and a third contributor, 'C.' [Anthony Collins], being distinguished in the fifth edition. It was first collected in one volume in 1721. To the fifth edition (1732) were appended 'The Craftsman,' a sermon, in the style of Daniel Burgess, also published separately, a letter to a 'Gentleman of Edinburgh,' and an epitaph on Trenchard. In a sixth edition (1735) there was added a third volume containing Gordon's letter to William Wake of 1719 and other tracts; a seventh edition appeared in 1743, and a fourth volume was added in 1747 containing tracts written during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. The book was mainly an attack on the High Church party, and on the title-page of later editions is called 'A Defence of Primitive Christianity ‚Ä¶ against the exorbitant claims of fanatical and disaffected clergymen.' Thomas Wilson, bishop of Sodor and Man, tried to exclude it from his diocese, and got into trouble in consequence. It was translated into French by the Baron d'Holbach. In 1720 Gordon and Trenchard began the publication of Cato's Letters. They appeared in the London Journal and then in the British Journal until Trenchard's death in 1723, and were reprinted in 4 vols. in 1724. Gordon published, by subscription, a translation of Tacitus, in 2 vols. 1728 (dedications to the Prince of Wales and Walpole), which went through several editions, and seems to have been the standard translation till the end of the century. Edward Gibbon read it in his youth (Misc. Works, i. 41). In 1744 he published The Works of Sallust, with Political Discourses upon that author; to which is added a translation of Cicero's \\"Four Orations against Cateline.\\" He published an 'Essay on Government' in 1747, and a 'Collection of Papers' by him appeared in 1748.

Background With the increasing popularity of bands such as The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy, the band was encouraged by their new label to move towards a heavier sound. The outcome was a marked change in direction which, whilst retaining some of the pop rock sensibilities of earlier recordings, saw the songs drenched in extreme levels of distortion. The effect was to create an album which divided opinion amongst even the most devoted of Wildhearts fans. Continuing an uninterrupted run of top 40 singles that had started with \\"Caffeine Bomb\\" back in 1994, both singles from the album - \\"Urge\\" and \\"Anthem\\" - entered the top 30. The album, however, stalled at No. 41. Within months, the band would be on 'hiatus', following internal tensions, making this the last official album that the band would release until \\"The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed\\" in 2003. \\"Heroin\\" is a cover of \\"Heroine\\" by The Dogs D'Amour. The Japanese version of the album featured a cover of the Elvis Costello song \\"Pump It Up\\". This was initially issued as an anonymous promo to DJs prior to the release of the album. DJ's were invited to guess who the band was on the return form. Around half guessed right, although one unnamed DJ ended up bizarrely thinking it was the work of former Beatle Paul McCartney. Other promotional CDs for the release of Endless Nameless caused controversy by depicting animals being hung as well as shot. Some sources say the album was named after Nirvana's 1991 song \\"Endless, Nameless\\", the hidden track at the end of their Nevermind album, though Ginger claims to have been unaware of the song's title at the time. The sonic booms heard in various tracks on the album were reused by former band member Devin Townsend multiple times on his album Infinity, such as the track \\"War\\" ending with the boom that ends Endless Nameless.

In these models, the rate of return of an asset (hence the converse its price) is a random variable whose realization in any time period is a linear combination of other random variables plus a disturbance term or white noise. In practice, a linear combination of observed factors included in a linear asset pricing model (for example, the Fama‚ÄìFrench three-factor model) proxy for a linear combination of unobserved risk factors if financial market efficiency is assumed. In the Intertemporal CAPM, non-market factors proxy for changes in the investment opportunity set. Risk factors occur whenever any sort of asset is involved, and there are many forms of risks from credit, liquidity risks to investment and currency risks. Different participants of risk factors contain different risk factors for each participant, for example, financial risks for the individual, financial risks for the Market, financial risks for the Government etc.  Financial risks for the individual  Financial risks for individuals occur when they make sub-optimal decisions.

It was built between 1768‚Äì1771 by Joseph Pickford. The hall was sold by the Wedgwoods in the 19th century and is now part of a hotel. History Serving-plate from Wedgwood's Frog Service for Catherine the Great, 1774, showing the hall The Wedgwoods Etruria Hall was built between 1768-1771 by Joseph Pickford, for Josiah Wedgwood, near his new recently built, Etruria works. The majority of the 'ceilings, ornamental friezes and chimney pieces' were designed by John Flaxman between 1781-1787. An entry in the 1784-1785 Wedgwood company ledger indicates that at least one of the ceilings was designed by William Blake, although it cannot be certain that this design was ever implemented. The hall was the site of the innovative research into photography by Thomas Wedgwood in the 1790s. There is a small commemorative plaque on the Hall. Due to financial difficulties Etruria Hall was sold in the 1840s by Francis Wedgwood, who moved to the smaller Barlaston Hall nearby. Recent history The building was given Grade II listed status in 1973. The house was restored as part of the 1986 Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival, the second of Britain's national garden festivals, and incorporated as the centre-piece of the festival to lend it a 'historical dimension'. After the end of the festival, the hall was one of the few buildings on the site allowed to remain. It was developed as part of the four-star Stoke on Trent Moat House, a member of the Best Western chain of independent hotels. It is now the hotel's meeting and events centre and the rooms are named after Josiah's business colleagues and friends including the Prince of Wales and Earl Granville. The walls of the hall are lined with prints of the Wedgwood family and Wedgwood pottery. The cellars beneath Etruria Hall were where Josiah Wedgwood performed some of his work developing new pottery bodies. Architecture and design The hall consists of a central block of three storeys flanked by two pavilions, both of two storeys. The building is built in the neo-classical style, with the central block featuring a large pediment. The majority of the work is in brick, with stone dressings. There is some evidence that the upper floor may have been rebuilt during extensive 19th century remodelling.

The Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra was chosen because, first, it represents significant area of forests on the island of Sumatra, because of the biodiversity, of lowland and mountain forest. This once vast island of tropical rainforest has been condensed to secluded areas, in the space of 50 years. Second, the national parks that make up the heritage are all located on the well-known key spine of the Bukit Barisan Mountains, known as the ‚ÄòAndes of Sumatra‚Äô, and that all around it there are magnificent views. The mountains of each site represent important mountainous backdrops to the established and developed lowlands of Sumatra.

He was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice in Salt Lake City, Utah. He entered politics and served as executive secretary to the Governor from 1915 to 1917.

The building is currently the second wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum. The other wing of the museum is located at the Old Tao Nan School building along Armenian Street. History The west fa√ßade of Empress Place Building, next to Raffles Landing Place. The north fa√ßade of Empress Place Building, near the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall. Sculptures depicting activities carried on the banks of the Singapore River on the south front of the Empress Place Building. A statue of Sir Stamford Raffles denotes his landing place in 1819, located next to the Empress Place Building. During the colonial era, the Empress Place Building was known simply as Government Offices. The first civic buildings were planned here in Sir Stamford Raffles' day. Originally intended to be a courthouse, the Empress Place Building instead became offices for the government departments located in the adjacent Maxwell's House (later the old Parliament House). Maxwell's House, designed by George Drumgoole Coleman, was a two-storey house built for a merchant, John Argyle Maxwell, in 1827. However, it was never occupied by him and it became a courthouse and lands office. Subsequently, it was converted to Government Offices and additions were made in 1839 and 1847. Constructed in four phases from 1864 to 1920, Government Offices was built to provide much needed space for the growing colonial administration. The original section of the building was designed by colonial engineer J.F.A. McNair and built by convict labour between June 1864 and December 1867. This original section now forms the part of the building nearest to the old Parliament House. Yet another courthouse was built in 1865; this is now the core of the Government Offices. In 1873‚Äì1875, the old courthouse was extended towards the river and this is where the Supreme Court of the Colony held its sessions from 1875 until 1939 when the first Supreme Court was built. Maxwell's original house became the Assembly House in 1954 after extensive renovations and reconstruction. The decision to build a new Town Hall was made in 1854; the building was completed in 1862. Government Offices that were housed included the Secretariat, Audit Office, Registration of Deeds Office, Land Office, Public Works and Medical Department, Treasury and Stamp Office, and the bureaux of the Colonial Engineer, the Official Assignee, and the Inspector General of the Police Force. The Legislative chamber occupied a room on the upper floor. In front of the building was a public square which was given the name Empress Place by the Municipal Council in 1907 in honour of Queen Victoria. It may well be the oldest pedestrian space in Singapore. Over time, Government Offices became associated with Empress Place and its name changed to what we know it today. As the demand for more government office space increased, three major extensions were added in 1880, 1904‚Äì1909 and 1920. Fortunately, every one of these extensions were faithful to McNair's Neo-Palladian design and the building maintained a harmonious overall look. In the surrounding area also known as Empress Place, the Memorial Hall and Tower were added in 1905 and extensive renovations were carried out from 1954 till 1979. Raffles' statue, now in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall and Theatre, as it is now called, was first erected on the Padang in 1887 but later removed to its present site in 1919. A second statue, a copy of the first one, was erected at Raffles Landing Place in 1972. The Dalhousie Memorial was originally located at Dalhousie Pier but found its present place in 1886. Cavenagh Bridge was built in 1869 and was converted to pedestrian traffic after the erection of Anderson Bridge. These are the major elements which have contributed to the developing qualities of Empress Place. The Empress Place Building was used by government departments until the late 1980s. It is perhaps best known as the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Citizenship Registry, and the Immigration Department. In the late 1980s, plans were made to convert Empress Place Building into a museum. Extensive restoration began, culminating in the opening of the Empress Place Museum on 7 April 1989 by the then Second Deputy Prime Minister Ong Teng Cheong. Although the museum was afflicted with structural and logistical problems from its inception, it nonetheless managed to organise five outstanding exhibitions on Chinese history in six years. The first of these exhibitions, which featured royal objects from the Qing Dynasty, put on display many precious artefacts never seen before outside China. By 1995, the museum's problems got the better of it and on 30 April that year, it closed its doors. Subsequently, the Empress Place Building underwent renovations and opened as the second wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum on 2 March 2003, exhibiting Southeast, South, and West Asian collections. The Empress Place Building was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992. Architecture Located at the mouth of the Singapore River, the Empress Place Building's imposing Neo-Palladian exterior with timber-louvred windows and pitched clay tile roofs caught the attention of immigrants and visitors sailing into Singapore harbour. A 1905 Singapore guidebook says of Government Offices and its neighbouring buildings, \\"Apart from the cities of India, there is, perhaps, no place in the East which boasts such a handsome group of [government] buildings as viewed from the sea.\\" Inside, the rooms are stately, with high ceilings, handsome Doric columns and exquisite plaster mouldings and cornices. Elegantly proportioned, the building is laid out symmetrically along a central axis.

Population Up to a half of the village's residents are First Nations people. The village is in traditional Kwakwaka'wakw territory. Two Indian Reserves take up the rest of Cormorant Island, Alert Bay 1 on the east side of the island, Alert Bay 1A on the west. Facilities and features Alert Bay has a credit union, grocery store, museums, a traditional \\"big house\\", a hospital, an RCMP station, a drug store, a post office, three restaurants and retail gift shops, a BC liquor store, a Royal Canadian Legion, a pub, doctors' offices, a dental clinic, a drug and alcohol treatment centre, and 4 automated teller machines (one in the bank, legion hall, restaurant and one inside Bayside Pub). The town has three airports (Alert Bay Airport, a public airport, and the Alert Bay Water Aerodrome). There is a boat harbour and a BC Ferries terminal with service to Sointula and Port McNeill. There is an elementary school (Alert Bay Elementary School for children in kindergarten and grades 1 to 7 and the T'lisalagi'lakw School (independent) owned and operated by the 'Namgis First Nation for children in Nursery, Kindergarten and grades 1 to 7. Students in Grades 8 to 12 travel by foot or ferry/water taxi to a school in nearby Port McNeill on Vancouver Island, along with students from Sointula on nearby Malcolm Island and others on North Island. There is also one campground and an ecological park consisting of a cedar swamp and a small area of old-growth trees. Alert Bay is home to the world's tallest totem pole. U'mista Cultural Centre In 1921, the Government of Canada, in an effort to stop the potlatch custom of dance, song, and wealth distribution under Section 116 of the Indian Act, confiscated many items including wooden masks, copper shields, and dance regalia. During the 1970s and 80s, the Kwakwaka'wakw regained their possessions after long negotiations. The returned artifacts are housed in a museum at the U'mista Cultural Centre. Origin of the name The settlement was named c.1860 after the Royal Navy ship HMS Alert, which conducted survey operations in the area.  Climate  Alert Bay has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) with a strong drying tendency in summer. Alert Bay is heavily moderated by the proximity to the Pacific Ocean and being located in the pathway of low-pressure systems from said ocean, heavy annual rainfall ensues. Winter is the wettest season, but snowfall is rare due to the average lows above freezing. Geology Volcanic features in the geography around Alert Bay are part of the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt. It appears to have been active in Miocene and Pliocene times. No Holocene eruptions are known, and volcanic activity in the belt has likely ceased.

The character made several appearances in the show as a small-time talent agent, the first in 1972, and later as a series regular from 1986 to 1992. He reappeared briefly in July 1995, and returned for a longer stint between April 1996 and December 1998. Alec is best known for his tempestuous marriage to long-running character Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear). Storylines Alec is introduced as the manager of a Working Men's Club, but soon progressed to being a theatrical agent with acts such as Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) under his control. In 1986, Alec took over the Graffiti Club on Rosamund Street, which enjoyed increased trade due to the fire at the Rovers Return. Through this Alec met Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear). It was after meeting Bet that Alec became a regular in Coronation Street and his character was fully explored by the show's writers. Alec was mugged in September 1988, which caused Bet to wonder if he was operating an insurance fiddle. Cecil Newton (Kenneth Alan Taylor) and the police suspected the same, but on this occasion Alec had been telling the truth and was being honest. He was deeply hurt that nobody had believed him. In 1992, Alec left Bet after being offered a full-time job with Sunliners in Southampton. Alec later returned in July 1995 to visit his granddaughter Vicky (Chloe Newsome), revealing that he was the regional manager of a travel agents, called Sunliners. He disapproved of Vicky's fianc√©, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), believing that Steve was only after Vicky because of her money. Alec tried to bribe Steve into calling the wedding off and leaving Vicky but was unsuccessful. Vicky severed ties with her grandfather and left for St. Lucia with Steve where they married. Alec refused to say goodbye to them and returned to Southampton. Alec returned permanently in April 1996. In May 1997 he was made redundant from Sunliners. This didn't keep Alec down for too long, however, as he began a partnership with Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) at The Rovers Return, since Alec helped bail Jack and Vera out of a VAT bill. In July 1998, Alec saved Rita Sullivan's (Barbara Knox) life after discovering her unconscious from carbon monoxide poisoning in her flat. It was caused by a faulty gas fire that Steve had fitted. The two subsequently became close, and Alec proposed to Rita. She accepted the proposal and when they both got cold feet, Alec decided to fit a door between their adjoining flats. They were both happy with the arrangement, ignoring the sniggers from other residents of the street. Relationships between Alec and the Duckworths soon became very strained and they finally agreed to dissolve their partnership, with Alec paying ¬£30,000 for Jack and Vera's share of the business. However, Alec allowed them to continue living and working at the Rovers. This arrangement didn't work out, and when Jack and Vera wanted to spend Christmas in Blackpool, Alec refused. They ignored him and still went, causing Alec to change the locks. Rita thought that Alec had gone too far, contacting the Duckworths in Blackpool and apologising. A three-day siege took place with no one willing to back down. When Alec discovered it was Rita who had phoned the Duckworths, he felt totally betrayed, and showing that money meant far more to him than affection, ended their relationship. To Rita's dismay Alec boarded up the doorway between their flats. When Vicky unexpectedly turned up at Christmas 1998, it gave Alec the change to contemplate his life and reassess his priorities. Alec suggested to Vicky that he could go in partnership with her at her new wine bar in Brighton. Alec jumped at the chance to get away, selling the Rovers to Natalie Barnes (Denise Welch), and leaving the street. Development=Departures In 1988, with his contract due to expire, Barraclough decided to quit the programme, citing typecasting as a reason for his departure. His exit storyline was in early planning stages when he had a surprise change of heart, as Bill Podmore recalls: \\"He insisted on leaving before he became better known as Alec Gilroy than Roy Barraclough, and all my efforts to dissuade him failed. Suddenly, out of the blue, he had a change of heart and the scriptwriters were spared the task of inventing a plausible exit for Alec. Barraclough references this in a 1990 interview: \\"For the foreseeable future, I will continue playing Alec because I'm enjoying it, but two years ago I thought I was going to pack it all in. The actor's instinct is to do it, move on and tackle another challenge. With soap, once you have established the character, it's just a case of learning a different situation each week. There's nothing else to explore. But Granada outlined all sorts of interesting ideas they had to develop the character and it sounded smashing.\\" Barraclough remained non-committal about his future with Coronation Street, a situation not helped by the addition of a third weekly episode in October 1989. Barraclough said: \\"It's damned hard work. If you're featured prominently in a storyline for five or six weeks, the pressure begins to get to you and the strain really starts to tell. It's very much bed and work. At the moment it's OK, but one could foresee a time when it could all get too much. I spent my life permanently tense.\\" In 1992, Barraclough quit the Street, and this time he did not change his mind. Although he expressed a desire for Alec to be killed off, writers instead chose to send him away to Southampton to resume his entertainment career, believing that Bet's new status as a separated woman had dramatic potential. When Julie Goodyear decided to leave her role as Bet Lynch after 25 years in 1995, Roy Barraclough was persuaded to return as Alec for a storyline which saw the Gilroys reunite to stop Vicky marrying Steve McDonald. The story saw Bet and Alec pick up where they left off, entertaining viewers with their bickering one last time. Alec next appeared in direct-to- video Coronation Street - The Feature Length Special, also in 1995, before returning to the regular programme full-time from April 1996 onwards. In September 1998, tabloids carried the story of Barraclough's resignation from the Street, with the Daily Mirror carrying a quote from the actor: \\"It's true I've told them I want to go at the end of my six-month contract. It's hard work these days and I've just completed a 19-week stint at the studios.\\" His final episode aired in December 1998. Reception The character has been described as \\"squat and snivelling\\", and not one of the \\"better choices\\" of Bet. He has also been described as being \\"Bet's long-suffering inamorata\\".

It can be thought of as a vector field which moves as time passes. For every instant of time, it associates a vector to every point in a Euclidean space or in a manifold. Definition A time dependent vector field on a manifold M is a map from an open subset \\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times M on TM :X: \\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times M \\\\longrightarrow TM ::::(t,x) \\\\longmapsto X(t,x)=X_t(x) \\\\in T_xM such that for every (t,x) \\\\in \\\\Omega, X_t(x) is an element of T_xM. For every t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} such that the set :\\\\Omega_t={x \\\\in M  (t,x) \\\\in \\\\Omega } \\\\subset M is nonempty, X_t is a vector field in the usual sense defined on the open set \\\\Omega_t \\\\subset M. Associated differential equation Given a time dependent vector field X on a manifold M, we can associate to it the following differential equation: :\\\\frac{dx}{dt}=X(t,x) which is called nonautonomous by definition. Integral curve An integral curve of the equation above (also called an integral curve of X) is a map :\\\\alpha : I \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\longrightarrow M such that \\\\forall t_0 \\\\in I, (t_0,\\\\alpha (t_0)) is an element of the domain of definition of X and :\\\\frac{d \\\\alpha}{dt} \\\\left.{!!\\\\frac{}{}}\\\\right_{t=t_0} =X(t_0,\\\\alpha (t_0)). Relationship with vector fields in the usual sense A vector field in the usual sense can be thought of as a time dependent vector field defined on \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times M even though its value on a point (t,x) does not depend on the component t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. Conversely, given a time dependent vector field X defined on \\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times M, we can associate to it a vector field in the usual sense \\\\tilde{X} on \\\\Omega such that the autonomous differential equation associated to \\\\tilde{X} is essentially equivalent to the nonautonomous differential equation associated to X. It suffices to impose: :\\\\tilde{X}(t,x)=(1,X(t,x)) for each (t,x) \\\\in \\\\Omega, where we identify T_{(t,x)}(\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times M) with \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times T_x M. We can also write it as: : \\\\tilde{X}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial{}}{\\\\partial{t}}+X. To each integral curve of X, we can associate one integral curve of \\\\tilde{X}, and vice versa. Flow The flow of a time dependent vector field X, is the unique differentiable map :F:D(X) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\longrightarrow M such that for every (t_0,x) \\\\in \\\\Omega, :t \\\\longrightarrow F(t,t_0,x) is the integral curve \\\\alpha of X that satisfies \\\\alpha (t_0) = x. Properties We define F_{t,s} as F_{t,s}(p)=F(t,s,p) #If (t_1,t_0,p) \\\\in D(X) and (t_2,t_1,F_{t_1,t_0}(p)) \\\\in D(X) then F_{t_2,t_1} \\\\circ F_{t_1,t_0}(p)=F_{t_2,t_0}(p) #\\\\forall t,s, F_{t,s} is a diffeomorphism with inverse F_{s,t}. Applications Let X and Y be smooth time dependent vector fields and F the flow of X. The following identity can be proved: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .{!!\\\\frac{}{}}\\\\right_{t=t_1} (F^*_{t,t_0} Y_t)_p = \\\\left( F^*_{t_1,t_0} \\\\left( [X_{t_1},Y_{t_1}] + \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .{!!\\\\frac{}{}}\\\\right_{t=t_1} Y_t \\\\right) \\\\right)_p Also, we can define time dependent tensor fields in an analogous way, and prove this similar identity, assuming that \\\\eta is a smooth time dependent tensor field: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .{!!\\\\frac{}{}}\\\\right_{t=t_1} (F^*_{t,t_0} \\\\eta_t)_p = \\\\left( F^*_{t_1,t_0} \\\\left( \\\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t_1}}\\\\eta_{t_1} + \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left .{!!\\\\frac{}{}}\\\\right_{t=t_1} \\\\eta_t \\\\right) \\\\right)_p This last identity is useful to prove the Darboux theorem.

They are known as the \\"Railway Rapists\\" and the \\"Railway Killers\\".  The attacks  In 1982 a woman (KJ) was raped by two men near Hampstead Heath railway station. Eighteen more women were attacked over the next year. Even more attacks occurred during 1984, and then three women were raped, on the same night, in 1985 in Hendon. West London Police initiated an urgent investigation, named \\"Operation Hart\\", to apprehend the perpetrators. On 29 December 1985 Alison Day, aged 19, was on her way to meet her boyfriend at work in Hackney Wick. She was followed off a train at Hackney Wick station by Duffy and Mulcahy, who grabbed and repeatedly raped her. She was then strangled with a ligature and tourniquet. Her body was sunk into the River Lea using discarded cobbles (granite setts). The Metropolitan Police in east London set up a further separate investigation, Operation Lea.\\"A Dangerous Place: The Story of the Railway Murders by Simon Farquhar\\" Police further stepped up their search for the attacker who had been nicknamed by the press the \\"Railway Rapist\\". The murder of Day changed this name to the \\"Railway Killer\\", a tag reinforced by the rape and murder of 15-year-old Maartje Tamboezer in West Horsley in Surrey on 17 April 1986. As well as rape and strangulation, Tamboezer's body was set on fire. Surrey Police set up Operation Bluebell. Meanwhile, the Day murder enquiry was taken over by Detective Superintendent Charles Farquhar (a highly experienced east London murder investigator) and he linked that murder with the previous railway rapes. He then drew a link with the murder of Tamboezer when he spotted that a belt and twig in a scene photo were the parts of a tourniquet ligature. A month later on 18 May 1986, Anne Lock, a 29-year-old secretary at London Weekend Television was abducted and murdered after she alighted from a train at Brookmans Park railway station, Hertfordshire. This heralded the first multi-police force murder enquiry (Operation Trinity) since the badly executed Yorkshire Ripper enquiry. It was the first such investigation to utilise basic computers and an early version of HOLMES (Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). The name of Duffy, a martial arts exponent and former railway carpenter, was identified by Det. Supt. John Hurst as a suspect among thousands of other names. He was known to police as he had been charged with the rape of his wife. He is known to have informed of his belief the act of rape was a \\"natural male instinct\\".[1] A rare type of string called 'somyarn' was found in his parents' house. This linked him to the second murder victim. His experience of traditional bow saws linked him to the unusual method of strangulation using a self-fashioned tourniquet, and his knowledge of the South Eastern railway system was part of his former job. David Mulcahy was also questioned, owing to his close friendship with Duffy, but victims were still traumatised and unable to pick him out of an identity parade (at that time, identity parades required the victim to physically touch the offender and get close to him). Mulcahy was released for lack of evidence.\\"A Dangerous Place: The Story of the Railway Murders by Simon Farquhar\\"  New methods  To help their inquiries, the police brought in a psychologist from the University of Surrey, Dr David Canter, who was working in the field of geographical psychology at the time. There had been no previous use in Britain of \\"psychological offender profiling\\" as it was known, but something fresh was required as two women and a child had been murdered and numerous others raped, with little progress being made. Canter examined the details of each crime and built up a profile of the attacker's personality, habits and traits. While this continued, another attack took place, when a 14-year-old girl was raped in a park. This enquiry led Dr Canter to set up investigative psychology.  Breakthrough  As well as working together with Mulcahy, Duffy had started to rape alone; he was arrested while following a woman in a secluded park. He was also questioned about the spate of rapes and murders, and the next day he was charged on all counts. Police knew that he had not committed the offences alone, but Duffy was not forthcoming about his accomplice.  Trial and conviction  Duffy went on trial in February 1988 and was convicted of two murders and four rapes, although he was acquitted of raping and killing Anne Lock (Lock's body had not been found until weeks after her murder, meaning DNA evidence could not be found on her body). He was given a minimum tariff of 30 years by the judge, later extended to a whole life tariff by the Home Secretary. A European Court of Human Rights ruling later removed the right of politicians to reset sentence tariffs, and so Duffy's stay in prison was reverted to the original 30 years.biography.com Following the trial, much was made of the psychological profile constructed by Canter, as Duffy fitted 13 of the 17 observations he had predicted regarding the attacker's lifestyle and habits. Such profiling became commonplace in policing thereafter.Criminal Profiling: Searching for Suspects p. 63  Accomplice is found  Following his conviction, Duffy revealed to a forensic psychologist what the police knew already: that he had not attacked the women alone. However, he chose to reveal no more until 1997, when he implicated Mulcahy, a lifelong friend from whom Duffy had been inseparable since their days together at school in Haverstock, North London. Whilst in school they were once excluded after being found laughing and covered in blood, following their bludgeoning a hedgehog. Duffy also admitted his involvement in the attack on Anne Lock, although he could not be re-tried for this under the double jeopardy rule (now abolished). However, Mulcahy‚Äîa married father of four‚Äîcould still be implicated, and following Duffy's claims he was tracked for several months by police prior to his arrest; DNA tests (which were not yet in use during the original investigation) also conclusively proved his involvement. Duffy appeared at the Old Bailey as a witness against Mulcahy in 2000, and gave detailed evidence over fourteen days. It was the first time a highest-category prisoner had given evidence against an accomplice. Prosecution evidence at the trial presented Mulcahy as the chief perpetrator and the first to decide that sexual stimulation was not enough of a thrill any more, so turning to murder. Mulcahy was convicted of three murders and seven rapes and handed three life sentences, with a 30-year recommendation. He was not later given a whole life tariff, as the ruling barring politically-set tariffs had been made by the time his case was due for review. Duffy was convicted of 17 more rapes and received a further 12 years. Neither man is expected ever to be released from prison. Police suspect them of countless other sex attacks, some dating back to the mid-1970s, while Mulcahy is also suspected of attacks which took place after Duffy was jailed. There has been occasional publicity concerning the pair since Mulcahy's imprisonment, including newspaper claims that Duffy was paid ¬£20,000 in return for information about his accomplice, and that Mulcahy has become a feared loan shark from his prison cell. In 2001, a television documentary Witness of Truth: The Railway Murders was broadcast. In 2016, a book was written about the case by Simon Farquhar (the son of DS Charles Farquhar), entitled A Dangerous Place: The Story of the Railway Murders.

In addition to medicine, Varella is a public commentator on issues such as prison conditions, social welfare, government, literature and his professed atheism and skepticism. Varella came from a family of Portuguese and Spanish descent from S√£o Paulo. He studied medicine at the Medical School of the University of S√£o Paulo. While a student, he was one of the founders of a pre-med preparatory course with Jo√£o Carlos di Genio and other colleagues, and where he taught chemistry for several years. This course later became the larger private educational system in Brazil, the Universidade Paulista and the Sistema Objetivo. Varella received the Pr√™mio Jabuti literary award in 2000 for his book Esta√ß√£o Carandiru. Medical career After graduation, he specialized in infectious diseases with Prof. Vicente Amato Neto, at the University of S√£o Paulo and at the Hospital do Servidor P√∫blico de S√£o Paulo. This work led him to develop an interest in immunology and in the last 20 years he worked at the Hospital do C√¢ncer of S√£o Paulo, specializing in oncology. As a medical professor, he works at Universidade Paulista, but has taught also in several other institutions in Brazil and abroad, such as the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Karolinska Institute, Hiroshima University and the National Cancer Center of Japan. One of his main fields of works has been AIDS, specially the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma. He has had an active role in prevention and educational campaigns about AIDS, being the first one to have a radio program on the subject. From 1989 to 2001 he volunteered to work as an unpaid physician in one of the largest prisons of Brazil, the Carandiru, in order to tackle the fearsome AIDS epidemics raging among male inmates. As a result of this experience, he wrote the best-seller book Esta√ß√£o Carandiru describing the harrowing life of the inmates, which later became a movie picture (Carandiru, directed by Hector Babenco), both winning accolades from the public and specialised national and international critics. As the chairman of a cancer research institute at Universidade Paulista, Varella presently heads a research program on the potential of Brazilian Amazon medicinal plants for treating neoplasms and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This research is supported by the S√£o Paulo Research Support Foundation. Science writing Varella is also very active in the public understanding of science, particularly in the medical area. He writes columns for the largest Brazilian newspapers and was invited by the Globo TV Network to host a series of programs on the human body, the brain, first aid, smoking, pregnancy, obesity and others, which were exhibited at the Fant√°stico show on Sundays. He is also the producer and host of a TV talk show on medicine and health, which is broadcast on several TV channels. For his work as a writer, Varella received several prizes and awards, among them the Pr√™mio Jabuti from the Brazilian Book Chamber, the International Book Fair of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, and The International Book Biennal of Rio de Janeiro (2001). He has also written fiction for adults and children and often a vocal supporter of scientific skepticism. Works * Carcereiros (2012) * AIDS Hoje.

History  The company was founded on January 20, 1934 as Fuji Shashin Film K.K. (ÂØåÂ£´ÂÜôÁúü„Éï„Ç£„É´„É†„à±, later translated as Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.), producing several sorts of film. It was an offshoot of Dai- Nippon Celluloid K.K. (Â§ßÊó•Êú¨„Çª„É´„É≠„Ç§„Éâ„à±), founded in 1919. The company's first CEO was Asano Sh≈´ichi (ÊµÖÈáé‰øÆ‰∏Ä). The plants were located in the village of Minami- Ashigara (ÂçóË∂≥ÊüÑÊùë, now a city) in the prefecture of Kanagawa (Á•ûÂ•àÂ∑ùÁúå), at the foot of Mt. Hakone (ÁÆ±Ê†πÂ±±). It is said that the name \\"Fuji\\" (ÂØåÂ£´) was chosen by Asano Sh≈´ichi because of Mt. Fuji (ÂØåÂ£´Â±±), situated not far from Mt. Hakone, but was already registered by a third party, to which the rights were bought for ¬•8,000, an important sum at the time. The company started to produce optical glass during the early 1940s for military use. The dependent company Fuji Shashin K≈çki K.K. (ÂØåÂ£´ÂÜôÁúüÂÖâÊ©ü„à±, meaning \\"Fuji Photo Optical Co., Ltd.\\") was founded in 1944, from the assets of Enomoto K≈çgaku Seiki Seisakusho (Ê¶éÊú¨ÂÖâÂ≠¶Á≤æÊ©üË£Ω‰ΩúÊâÄ), but this was absorbed back into Fuji Shashin Film after 1945.Many other Fuji companies were created after the war, all of them dependent of the main Fuji Shashin Film company and eventually of the Fujifilm Group (ÂØåÂ£´„Éï„Ç£„É´„É†„Ç∞„É´„Éº„Éó). Fuji began producing cameras in 1948 with the Fujica Six. Until the late 1970s, many cameras made by Fuji were called Fujica, a contraction of Fuji and camera (cf Leica, Yashica etc.). The company started producing digital cameras in 1988. Fujifilm was the most agile among film makers in adapting to digital imaging. Today it offers leading technology in smaller digital consumer cameras with high-sensitivity CCDs (see Super CCD); it also sells DSLRs.

During his brief career, he played as an inside forward for CF Belenenses and the Portugal national football team, and was considered by many to be Portugal's best player of the time. Despite the young age at which he died, P√©pe won two Portuguese Championships (Ta√ßa de Portugal) and three Lisbon Championships (Campeonato de Lisboa). Early Life Jos√© Manuel Soares Louro, better known as \\"Pepe\\", was born to a poor family at No. 17 Rua do Embaixador, in Bel√©m, western Lisbon, on January 30, 1908. Club career At the age of 18, Pepe made his first appearance for Belenenses on 28 February 1926 against Benfica, entering the match in the 75th minute with Belenenses down 4-1. In the subsequent 13 minutes, Belenenses scored three goals, tying the contest at 4-4. In the final minute, Benfica were called for a foul in the penalty area. With none of the Belenenses players stepping forward to take the penalty, Pepe, the rookie, was called in by his captain to take the shot. He did not fail. Belenenses won 4-5, giving birth to the expression \\"a quarter- hour to Belenenses,\\" an expression still used in Portugal. Soares played 140 games in his club career, all with FC Belenenses. In the 1929/30 Lisbon Championship season, P√©pe played 14 games, scoring 36 goals (a stunning average of 2.57 goals per game). This included a single-game record of 10 goals scored in a 12-1 victory over Bom Sucesso (a record that stands to this day). Caricature postcard of CF Belenenses star ‚ÄúP√©pe‚Äù Soares International career Pepe made his international debut for Portugal at the age of 19, in a friendly against France played in Lisbon on 16 March 1927. Pepe scored two goals in his national side‚Äôs 4‚Äì0 victory. In total, he played 14 games for the Portuguese national team, scoring 7 goals. P√©pe also played for Portugal at the 1928 Olympic Games football tournament in Amsterdam. Portugal defeated Chile (4-2) and Yugoslavia (2-1), but subsequently lost to Egypt (1-2) in the quarter-finals. Egypt later lost to Argentina in the semi-finals and to Italy in the match for the bronze medal. Pepe's last appearance for Portugal was in Porto on 23 February 1930, a 2‚Äì0 win over France. P√©pe Soares - international debut for Portugal against France, Lisbon, 16 March 1927 Death On 23 October 1931, Pepe collapsed at work ‚Äì he worked as a lathe operator, in a time when playing football in Portugal was often not a sole source of income. He was taken to the Naval Hospital in Lisbon with severe abdominal pain, and died the next day. He was just 23 years old. There is still no consensus as to the specific circumstances behind Pepe's death, which was due to food poisoning. The best-known story tells of a tragic mistake made by his mother while preparing a meal on 22 October, two days before his death. P√©pe‚Äôs mother, who could not read, mistakenly exchanged caustic soda for salt when she made chorizos. The next day, P√©pe took a sandwich containing the chorizo to work with him and consumed the corrosive compound. Of note, other relatives who had eaten the meal had also been hospitalized, but survived, and a cat that had consumed the chorizo died. Funeral procession for Pepe in 1931 Pepe's funeral was an event of mourning on an almost-national scale. Thirty thousand people attended to pay their respects to the young star, whose loss shook the Portuguese sports world. Attendees also came from outside Portugal, including one of the greatest goalies in the history of football, Spaniard Ricardo Zamora. Legacy Statue of Jos√© Manoel Soares Pepe In 1932, the year after his death, Belenenses erected a memorial to P√©pe at the Sal√©sias Stadium in Lisbon. The stadium itself was later re-named in Pepe's honor. When CF Belenenses moved to Restelo stadium in Lisbon in 1956, the memorial to Pepe was placed at the stadium entrance. It is a tradition that whenever FC Porto visits CF Belenenses for a match, the team always leaves a wreath in front of the statue before the game.

King James II of Aragon and Frederick III of Sicily were present with their fleets at the battle. The larger Aragon-Angevin fleet was trapped on a lee shore but was able to win the battle with the intervention of its 6-galley reserve that attacked the rear of the Sicilian fleet. The Sicilians fled when the flagship, with Frederick aboard, pulled back after the king collapsed from heat and exhaustion. Eighteen Sicilian vessels were captured and their crews massacred. The battle allowed for the invasion of Sicily but James, breaking with his Angevin allies withdrew his force to Aragon and Frederick was able to defeat the Angevin army on land and secure the independence of Sicily in the Peace of Caltabellotta.  Background  As part of his attempt to conquer Sicily James II of Aragon amassed a fleet of 46 Aragon (or Catalan) and 10 Angevin galleys at Naples, together with a number of cargo ships. James intended to use his fleet to carry an army to Patti, around 30 miles west of the Sicilian capital of Messina. However he learnt his enemy, Frederick III of Sicily, had put 40 galleys to sea in an attempt to intercept the invading force. To try to avoid the Sicilian fleet James altered his plans and instead landed further to the west at Cape Orlando. Aware that the Sicilian fleet was not far off James disembarked his stores, horses and sick at Cape Orlando and transferred infantrymen from his transport ships to his fighting galleys. Frederick delayed his fleet at sea, awaiting the arrival of an additional 8 vessels from Cefalu, some 40 miles away, and in doing so lost the element of surprise. James gave command of his fleet to his admiral Roger of Lauria.  Battle  Lauria, caught in a lee shore and unable to put to sea, positioned his fleet close to the shore, with his centre slightly further forward and all ships closely chained together to strengthen his formation. It is considered probable that Lauria also ordered flying bridges constructed to allow the reinforcement of his crews by soldiers from the shore. Frederick approached with his flagship in the centre of his line, 20 vessels to his left and 19 to the right, and also in a closely chained formation. Initially the battle was conducted at a distance with both lines of ships exchanging crossbow fire. However one of Frederick's captains, eager to close with the enemy, cut his chains and pushed forwards. Other Sicilian vessels followed his lead and soon both battle lines were broken with all vessels engaging in close quarters fighting. James' fleet had just captured the first Sicilian ship when a force of six of his vessels, held back in reserve by Lauria, attacked the Sicilian rear. At about this time King Frederick is said to have collapsed from heat exhaustion, causing his flagship to withdraw to ensure his safety. This caused the flight of the Sicilian fleet. Lauria, who had fought for Frederick when Aragon was allied to Sicily, captured 18 Sicilian galleys and ordered the massacre of their crews in revenge for the recent death of his nephew at the hands of Frederick. Some sources state that James ordered that Frederick be allowed to escape unharmed.  Aftermath  Despite the battle wiping out the Sicilian defence fleet and leaving the island open to invasion James did not make use of his good fortune. He fell out with his Angevin allies and returned to Spain. The Angevin force was defeated in land battles and by the signing of the Peace of Caltabellotta in 1302 Frederick had guaranteed the independence of Sicily. The battle secured Lauria's position as commander of the Angevin navy.

The village is seven miles (12 km) south of Lewes. In the 1890s the village's population grew from less than 100 to over 500 after a cement manufacturing plant opened nearby. The village is now associated with the urbanised area of Newhaven. There is no place called North Heighton although part of the South Downs above the village is called Heighton Hill, from which one can get to Norton, which lies north-east of South Heighton, and north of Bishopstone. It is a regular thoroughfare and point of rest for ramblers, and features a series of ponds, known locally as 'The Three Lakes', which were until the early 1990s open to the public. It remains a popular destination for local visitors, with its public house, The Hampden Arms, and until recently, its corner-shop and post office, which has now closed and been converted into a residential dwelling. South Heighton is one of many villages in the area which maintains a bonfire society, celebration and parade. South Heighton is famous for its secret tunnels, built and used for defence during the Second World War, which lie underneath most of the village, with the main entrance at Denton House. In 1998, when work finished on the conversion of Denton House into flats and of the surrounding area into houses, the road was called Forward Close, after the ship associated with Newhaven and the secret tunnels, . Notable residents, past and present, include Ralph Reader, originator of the Scouting Gang Show and Ursula Mommens, the great- granddaughter of Charles Darwin and the great-great-granddaughter of the potter Josiah Wedgwood. Governance On a local level, South Heighton is governed by the South Heighton Parish Council. Council meetings are held every six weeks in the South Heighton village hall. Their responsibilities include footpaths, street lighting, playgrounds and minor planning applications. The parish council has seven seats available although only four were filled in the uncontested May 2007 election. The next level of government is the district council. The parish of South Heighton lies within the Ouse Valley and Ringmer ward of Lewes District Council which returns three seats to the council. The election on 4 May 2007 elected two Liberal Democrats and one local Conservative. East Sussex County Council is the next tier of government, for which South Heighton is within the Ouse Valley East division, with responsibility for Education, Libraries, Social Services, Civil Registration, Trading Standards and Transport. Elections for the County Council are held every four years. The Liberal Democrat Pat Ost was elected in the 2005 election and again in a 2009. In 2013, UKIP candidate Peter Charlton was elected, who was displaced by local Liberal Democrat candidate, Darren Grover, in 2017. The UK Parliament constituency for South Heighton is Lewes. The Liberal Democrat Norman Baker was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewes in East Sussex from his election in 1997 to his defeat in 2015. He was replaced with Maria Caulfield, a Conservative Party politician At European level, South Heighton is represented by the South-East region, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament. The June 2004 election returned 4 Conservatives, 2 Liberal Democrats, 2 UK Independence, 1 Labour and 1 Green, none of whom live in East Sussex.

Moore (born October 21, 1956) is an Irish and American virologist and epidemiologist who co-discovered together with his wife, Yuan Chang, two different human viruses causing the AIDS-related cancer Kaposi's sarcoma and the skin cancer Merkel cell carcinoma. The couple met while in medical school together and were married in 1989 while they pursued fellowships at different universities. Education and career Moore received a Bachelor of Science in chemistry and biology from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, an M.S. degree from Stanford University, and M.D. and MPhil degrees from the University of Utah, and an M.P.H. degree from the University of California, Berkeley. As an epidemiologist working at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), he developed widely used international guidelines to control meningococcal meningitis epidemics and led a team of CDC epidemiologists during the 1992 Somali Civil War. Civilian death rates documented during this civil war-famine were among the highest ever reported. The extreme mortality statistics helped to solidify international support behind the US-led military intervention Operation Restore Hope. He received the CDC Langmuir Prize for his work on epidemic meningitis control. After leaving the CDC, Moore served briefly as a New York City epidemiologist but quit to search for new human viruses with his wife, Yuan Chang who was then a newly appointed assistant professor at Columbia University. Unemployed, he worked in his wife's laboratory, allowing him to rapidly pick up training in molecular biology. Despite having no research funding, Moore and Chang used a new molecular biology technique, representational difference analysis, to search for a virus causing Kaposi's sarcoma, the most common malignancy among AIDS patients. In 1994, they discovered a new human herpesvirus, KSHV, in a KS tumor and along with several collaborators showed that it was the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Moore was hired onto the faculty at Columbia and the Chang-Moore Laboratory secured research funding to investigate this new virus. They subsequently sequenced KSHV, identified oncogenes encoded by the virus, demonstrated transmission during transplantation and developed diagnostic tests to detect infection. His laboratory currently seeks to understand the role of tumor virus immunoevasion of the innate immune system as a cause for viral tumorigenesis. In 2002, he moved his laboratory to the University of Pittsburgh where he is the director of the Molecular Virology Program at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Chang and Moore jointly developed a new technique to find human tumor viruses called digital transcriptome subtraction (DTS). Using this approach, they identified the most recently discovered human polyomavirus infecting Merkel cells. This virus is the likely cause of Merkel-cell carcinoma and hence is named Merkel cell polyomavirus. Moore and Chang have discovered two of the seven known human viruses causing cancer. Awards *Moore and Chang have been awarded the 1997 Meyenburg Cancer Research Prize, 1998 Robert Koch Prize, the 2003 General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Charles S.

The Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway was authorised to build a line from Peckham Rye railway station to a terminus at Crystal Palace in 1862, in order to serve the attraction of the Crystal Palace.  History  The station was opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway on 1 August 1884. It was temporarily closed from 1 January 1917 until 1 March 1919, and again between 22 May 1944 and 4 March 1946. Permanent closure occurred on 20 September 1954. Upper Sydenham station was the penultimate station on the route before Crystal Palace, sitting in the wooded area at the top of Sydenham Hill, overlooking Dulwich and Sydenham. The station and the line was poorly used despite new houses being built in the area as passengers preferred to use other stations near-by (Sydenham Hill, Crystal Palace (Lower Level) and Sydenham) which were on more direct routes. The line was one of the first of the former South Eastern and Chatham Railway to be electrified by Southern Railway, under \\"South Eastern Electrification - Stage 1\\" in July 1925. The destruction of the Crystal Palace in 1936 saw patronage reduced. During the Second World War the branch line suffered damage from enemy action. After the war the cost of repairing the war damage with declining receipts led to the decision to close the line to close on 20 September 1954, the first permanent closure of a Southern Electric line. The dismantling of the station took place in 1957.  Current  Today all that remains of Upper Sydenham Station is the booking office and station house, which is now a private residence on Wells Park Road, the railway tunnel which is now blocked off but intact as well as some ruined huts and a few muddy hints of where the line and platform once ran. It is thought that the station platforms were buried when the area was landscaped and some platform fragments are visible in the ground adjacent to the tunnel mouth. The station's location sits in Dulwich Woods, providing a popular local footpath.

Early life and career Goddard was born in Fontabelle, Saint Michael, Barbados, into a family that controlled one of the leading trading companies in Barbados.Gideon Haigh, The Summer Game, ABC Books, Sydney, 2006, p. 43. He was a younger brother of the writer, lecturer and mystic Neville Goddard. He attended The Lodge School in Barbados, where he excelled at cricket, soccer and athletics.Keith A. P. Sandiford, Cricket Nurseries of Colonial Barbados, University of West Indies Press, Kingston, 1998, p. 51. He played for Barbados from 1936‚Äì37 to 1957‚Äì58. A middle-order batsman, he scored five first-class centuries in his career, all for Barbados in the period from 1942‚Äì43 to 1946‚Äì47, when in 12 matches he made 1219 runs at an average of 67.72. His highest score was 218 not out, against Trinidad in 1943‚Äì44, when he and Frank Worrell added 502 in 404 minutes in an unbroken partnership for the fourth wicket.Barbados v Trinidad 1943‚Äì44 He captained Barbados from 1946‚Äì47 until his retirement. Test career to 1950 He made his Test debut in the West Indies' first series after the Second World War, when England toured in 1947‚Äì48. Goddard played in all four Tests, taking over the captaincy in the Third and Fourth Tests. His medium-paced off-spin bowling was more successful than his batting (he ran through the England top order in the Third Test to take 5 for 31,West Indies v England, Georgetown 1947‚Äì48 and in the series took 11 wickets at 26.09 and made 122 runs at 24.40) but it was in captaincy that he excelled. The first two Tests had been drawn, but under Goddard West Indies won the last two easily. After the Third Test, Wisden announced that West Indies had \\"discovered a really efficient captain\\";Wisden 1949, p. 754 after the Fourth Test it spoke of his \\"inspiring leadership\\" and called him \\"a great captain\\".Wisden 1949, pp. 758‚Äì59. He led the West Indies in 1948‚Äì49 on their first tour of India, winning the five match series 1‚Äì0. Wisden noted: \\"The West Indian team found great inspiration in the leadership of Goddard, whose sound judgment and circumspection were attributes that counted so much for the success of the tour. A talented player and expert tactician, he commanded the respect of his men and so got the best out of them.\\"R. W. Thick, \\"West Indies in India\\", Wisden 1949, pp. 795‚Äì96. He made 190 runs at 47.50 and took 9 wickets at 39.00 in the series. The 1950 tour of England was a triumph for the West Indies. In their three previous tours of England they had never won a Test match ‚Äì this time they won the series 3‚Äì1. Wisden commented: \\"A heavy responsibility falls on any touring captain, and Goddard with his strong personality showed ability to control his men both on and off the field. All of them had the utmost faith in him ... there can be no question that the flourishing state of cricket in the Caribbean to-day is partly due to his shrewdness and leadership.\\"Norman Preston, \\"West Indies in England, 1950\\", Wisden 1951, p. 208. Goddard made only 106 runs at 26.50 batting at number eight, and bowled only 74.4 overs in the four Tests, taking 6 wickets at 20.33. At this stage Goddard had captained West Indies in 11 Tests, winning six and losing only one. Test career after 1950 He was awarded the OBE in 1951.Sandiford, p. 52. The tour of Australia in 1951‚Äì52, however, resulted in a 4‚Äì1 win to Australia, and the 1‚Äì0 victory in the two-Test series that followed in New Zealand was insufficient compensation. Goddard made 182 runs at 26.00 and took 5 wickets at 32.20 in the six Tests he played (he stood down for the Fifth Test, allowing Jeff Stollmeyer to captain the side ‚Äì to a 202-run defeat). By this time his captaincy was beginning to arouse dissent. As Australia inched towards a one-wicket victory in the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Goddard argued on the field with Stollmeyer and Gerry Gomez about who should bowl, and Sonny Ramadhin, who had bowled 39 overs and taken 3 wickets, got fed up and walked off the field.Alan McGilvray, The Game is Not the Same, ABC Books, Sydney, 1985, p. 130. After the tour, Stollmeyer, who had been Goddard's vice-captain in India, England, Australia and New Zealand, said that Goddard had received too much credit for the success of the 1950 tour, and that the other senior players of the side had received too little. His comments led to long-standing animosities and divisions in the West Indian camp.Cricinfo story 'Will Chanderpaul go the Goddard way?' Later, when Goddard was picked to captain the team in the tour of England in 1957, Stollmeyer quit first-class cricket for good. Goddard did not play in the home series against India in 1952‚Äì53, England in 1953‚Äì54, or Australia in 1954‚Äì55, when Stollmeyer was the captain for most of the time. He returned to the side as player- manager of the team to New Zealand in 1955‚Äì56, when Denis Atkinson was captain and Stollmeyer did not tour. Playing in the first three Tests of the four- match series, Goddard scored 147 runs for once out, including his highest Test score of 83 not out in the Second Test at Christchurch, when he added 143 for the seventh wicket with Atkinson after West Indies had been 169 for 6.New Zealand v West Indies, Christchurch 1955‚Äì56 West Indies won all three Tests, then lost the Fourth, in which Goddard did not play. The 1957 tour to England resulted in a 3‚Äì0 defeat in the five-match series. Goddard himself made only 112 runs at 16.00 and took 2 wickets at 64.00. His resolute defence helped the team draw the First and Third Tests. In the Third, West Indies followed on 247 runs behind and were 194 for 6 when Goddard came to the wicket, and he made 61 in 215 minutes in a partnership of 154 with Collie Smith that left England too little time to score the winning runs.England v West Indies, Nottingham 1957 His final tally from 22 Tests as captain was eight wins, seven losses and seven draws. Apart from his captaincy and his batting and bowling, he was also a fine fielder close to the wicket, \\"notably at silly mid-off\\".Christopher Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers, Rigby, Adelaide, 1983, p. 339. Goddard died in London in 1987 while visiting for the celebrations of the bicentenary of the MCC.Wisden 1988, p. 1204.

The last of the Virginia Shacklefords apparently sold their generations-old holding in 1805, when James Shackleford (the spelling of the name varies) of Carteret County sold his holdings on the Banks to Roger and John Shackleford of Georgetown, South Carolina, where a branch of the Virginia Shackleford family had eventually migrated. That deed specified \\"a certain parcel of land on Old Topsail Inlet, beginning at Whaler's Creek on said Banks and across to the sea; thence back to Old Topsail Inlet.\\" (The Shackleford family traced their Virginia origins to the village of Shacklefords in King and Queen County.) John Shackleford's garrison is listed in Colonial Records, January 19, 1712. \\"John Shackleford at the garrison at the Shackleford Plantation to be allowed to plant Corne on said Plantation, plant, tend and gather Corne during time they keep a garrison there.\\" This shows troops were stationed at the garrison and the soil was tillable on the Banks during 1712. He was appointed to see \\"Every ship drawing eight feet of water anchoring at Shackleford Banks to charge three shillings six pence per foot\\". In 1886, after a ship named the Chrissie Wright was wrecked on Shackelford Banks, some of the bodies of the drowned crew were buried in Beaufort. Remembering the Chrissie Wright Shackleford Banks once had permanent residents. The now-abandoned settlement of Diamond City was located on the Banks, but the last occupants had relocated by 1902.Diamond City, North CarolinaDiamond City, North Carolina Until 1933, Shackleford Banks was connected to the Core Banks. Barden Inlet was opened by the 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane, separating the Shackleford Banks from South Core Banks.\\"Barrier Island Ecology of Cape Lookout National Seashore,\\" NPS Scientific Monograph No. 9, Chapter 3  Today  A feral horse on Shackleford. Shackleford Banks is known for the feral horses that roam there. The National Park Service closely monitors and studies these \\"Banker horses\\". They provide a glimpse into how horses lived in the wild before their domestication. The manner in which the horses arrived is still a mystery; legend has it that these horses are descendants of Spanish Mustangs that survived a shipwreck. Visitors can take a ferry to the island from Morehead City, Beaufort, or Harkers Island. Since the horses roam the island, visitors may have to search for them. People ought to keep away from the horses, for they are feral and not accustomed to humans. If provoked, the horses may attack.

Her case was profiled on the television program Unsolved Mysteries and On the Case with Paula Zahn. Jessica was chased down a country road naked except for one sock and a bra. She had duct tape around her hands and her head covering her mouth. She was raped and beaten before she was killed. Before the murder Jessica Lyn Keen, a 15-year-old girl from Columbus, Ohio was a model student‚Äîan honor student and a cheerleader. However, she quit cheerleading and her grades dropped after meeting Shawn Thompson, an 18-year-old from Central Ohio. Her parents objected to her seeing Thompson but did not know what to do. They placed her in a home for troubled teens on March 4, 1991. Body discovered After being missing for two days, Jessica Keen's body was found at the back of Foster Chapel Cemetery, 20 miles from the teen facility. She had been raped and badly beaten. She was still wearing her ring and watch, but a pendant with the word \\"taken\\" was nowhere to be found. Her boyfriend was the prime suspect, but DNA tests proved he was not responsible. Police theorized that she had escaped her abductors and ran to the cemetery. Evidence in the cemetery shows she tried to hide behind grave stones‚Äîone of her socks was found, and a knee imprint in the mud behind a grave stone was found with or near the sock. She was killed near a fence in the cemetery, presumably by her abductors, who had followed her. A cross with her name on it was placed where her body was discovered near the fence in the cemetery. Arrest On April 9, 2008, police in Burlington, North Carolina arrested Marvin Lee Smith, Jr. Based on DNA evidence, Smith was charged with unlawful sexual conduct on Keen, a felony, and was extradited to Ohio to face charges. In 2009, Smith admitted to a Madison County courtroom that he had in fact raped and murdered Keen. Smith told the court that Keen had escaped his car and run into Foster Chapel Cemetery, where she collided with a fence post and fell. Smith said that he beat Keen to death with a tombstone, then discarded it over the fence nearby. Reports show that police had indeed found bloodied pieces of a tombstone where Smith had indicated. In exchange for his confession, Smith avoided a death penalty trial that was set for March 2009. He pleaded guilty to one charge of aggravated murder, with specifications of rape and murder, and was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.

The village is located five miles (8 km) south of Lewes, on the A26 road to Newhaven. The south west border of the parish runs along the River Ouse, the parish extending into the South Downs. Landmarks The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, is a Grade I listed building. It was built in the 13th century and has a 14th-century font. Two other Grade II listed buildings, the Manor Farmhouse and associated barn, are within the parish. Governance On a local level, the parish is governed with a Parish meeting although there have been no representations in recent years. The next level of government is the district council. The parish of Tarring Neville lies within the Ouse Valley and Ringmer ward of Lewes District Council, which returns three seats to the council. East Sussex County Council is the next tier of government, for which Tarring Neville is within the Ouse Valley East division, with responsibility for Education, Libraries, Social Services, Civil Registration, Trading Standards and Transport. Elections for the County Council are held every four years. The UK Parliament constituency for Tarring Neville is Lewes. At European level, Tarring Neville is represented by the South-East England constituency, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament. Name Tarring is believed to be derived from either Tare(tar) ing(fort or stronghold) or Torr(Tower) ing(fort or stronghold) so it translates to the Tar Fort or Tower Fort. The most likely explanation for this name is to mean that this was where ships were waterproofed with tar. The place names ending in ing, inge or ings were usually found on higher ground, or in places which control strategic points, and appear to surround areas first settled by the Saxons. The Neville suffix was added after the Norman conquest in 1066 when the Neville family took ownership of the village. Commerce South of the village, along the A26 road, is the Tarring Neville chalk quarry. The quarry produces high quality chalk used locally for the manufacture of plaster. The quarry has reserves to last until 2019.

The band is still active, more than 30 years after its foundation. History The group was started in 1985 by the composer Hanne Haller. The members of the band at that time were Alexander \\"Ala\\" Heiler, Christiane von Kutschenbach, Rainer H√∂glmeier, Willie Jakob, Sami Kalifa and Petra Scheeser. The group has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for Germany three times. The first time was shortly after the formation of the band, in Eurovision 1985. With the song \\"F√ºr alle\\" (\\"For All\\") they finished second, just behind the winning duo Bobbysocks from Norway. In 1987 Wind returned to the contest, performing \\"La√ü die Sonne in dein Herz\\" (\\"Let the Sun in Your Heart\\") in Brussels, Belgium. Once again they achieved a second place, this time behind Johnny Logan who represented Ireland. \\"La√ü die Sonne in dein Herz\\" has since become the band's trademark tune, including welcoming visitors to their official website. Wind entered Eurovision for a third time in 1992 in Malm√∂, Sweden, with the song \\"Tr√§ume sind f√ºr alle da\\" (\\"Dreams Are For Everyone\\"). This time they were not as successful, finishing 16th of 23 participants. According to John Kennedy O'Connor in his book The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History,O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. Carlton Books UK. Wind are the only act to ever finish second in the contest on two occasions. The group is a heavy hit-producing band. In the period since 1997 they have released more than 15 singles. Rainer H√∂glmeier left the group in the mid-1980s and relocated to the United States.

This image shows how building height and density (and therefore value) has increased near rail transit stations.Value capture is a type of public financing that recovers some or all of the value that public infrastructure generates for private landowners. In many countries, the public sector is responsible for the infrastructure required to support urban development. This infrastructure may include road infrastructure, parks, social, health and educational facilities, social housing, climate adaptation and mitigation tools, and more. Such infrastructure typically requires great financial investment and maintenance, and often the financing of such projects leans heavily on the government bodies themselves. Public entities, tasked with creating and maintaining this infrastructure, are constantly in search of mechanisms which can allow for fiscal support of these investments. One such mechanism of financing is Value Capture. Value capture schemes secure and recover a portion of the benefits delivered by public investments, in order to offset the costs of the investment itself. Value Capture strategies operate under the assumption that public investment often results in increased valuation of private land and real estate. \\"Capturing‚Äù the subsequent increase in value, governments are able to recuperate funds, which can ultimately be used to generate additional value for communities in the future. Description Public investments, such as building transportation or sewer facilities, can increase adjacent land values, generating an unearned profit for private landowners. The unearned value (increases in land value which otherwise profit private landowners cost- free) may be \\"captured\\" directly by converting them into public revenue (see georgism). Thus, value capture internalizes the positive externalities of public investments, allowing public agencies to tax the direct beneficiaries of their investments. Urban planners and finance officials are often interested in value capture mechanisms, for at least two reasons: 1) because they offer a targeted method to finance infrastructure benefiting specific land, and 2) because some such investments can generate private investment in the area, which will more widely benefit the city (e.g., by providing employment opportunities, shopping and other amenities, and a more robust and diverse tax base.) It can be politically useful to capture for the city treasury a share of the positive externalities of city-financed investment. This can help address public concern about the fact or perception of unfair windfalls when specific owners‚Äô land values increase after urban infrastructure investment is paid from general city revenues. Although it is not always talked about as such, the most common value capture mechanism is the general real property tax, with no special features other than regular assessment of market value; this is because the common real estate tax includes the less known land value tax. The value of any given land is determined by its proximity to various amenities (both public and private). Thus, for example, when a new subway station or highway interchange is installed, land near the new facility becomes more valuable. Investment in capital improvements to land can synergistically generate capital investment in other nearby locations, which further increases land value. Thus, even if the rate of taxation does not change, the tax revenue generated from properties which benefit goes up by way of higher land values and increased development. The effectiveness of value capture depends, of course, on a smoothly functioning ad valorem property or land value tax system, with regularly updated assessments. Examples Value capture strategies can be applied to developers or landowners, and they can be applied before or after a public improvement is built.CTS Featured Research: Value Capture In the case of new public transit facilities, the property value premium nearby can be as high as 167%.Transit and Value Capture - Reconnecting America Types of value capture include the following:A Decision-Support Framework For Using Value Capture to Fund Public Transit: Lessons From Project-Specific Analyses  Mineta Transportation Institute Research Report * Land value tax (LVT) * Tax- increment financing (TIF) * Special assessment districts or improvement districts * Infrastructure impact fees (such as traffic or utility fees) * Joint development * Air rights * Exactions, public easements, or other nonpossessory interests See also * Externality * Georgism / Geolibertarianism * Pigovian tax * Property tax * Wealth tax  References = Citations  Sources  * David M.

He started the sushi chain YO! Sushi in 1997, and appeared as a \\"Dragon\\" on the first UK series of Dragons' Den. Woodroffe conceived and launched YO! Sushi after an early spell in television. The business established conveyor belt sushi bars featuring call buttons, robot drinks trolleys, Japanese TV, self heating plates and other such novelties. He currently speaks around the world at corporate and promotional events, and has appeared on stage at the Edinburgh Festival to discuss his YO! ventures including YO! Company.

The family lived in a five-bedroom detached farmhouse in Essex. Woodroffe left Marlborough College towards the end of the 1960s, at the age of 16, with 2 O-levels.  Business career  Woodroffe founded YO! Sushi in 1997 without the need for start-up capital. At the time that his first restaurant opened, despite its popularity, he was unable to obtain financing from banks. Instead, Woodroffe asked his largest supplier for extended terms to pay off his debt. The company had believed YO! Sushi would be a \\"safe bet\\" because it had the support of Honda, Sony, and All Nippon Airways. In a 2008 interview, Woodroffe revealed that in fact those three companies had provided only very limited sponsorship for the business: some cheap televisions and a motorcycle. In September 2003, Woodroffe sold his controlling interest in YO!

FMT is an effective treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). It may be more effective than vancomycin. Side effects may include a risk of infections, therefore the donor should be screened. FMT involves restoration of the colonic microflora by introducing healthy bacterial flora through infusion of stool via colonoscopy, enema, orogastric tube, or by mouth in the form of a capsule containing feces from a healthy donor, which in some cases is freeze-dried. With CDI becoming more common, FMT is gaining increasing prominence, with some experts calling for it to become the first-line therapy for CDI. FMT has been used experimentally to treat other gastrointestinal diseases, including colitis, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's. In the United States, human feces has been regulated as an experimental drug since 2013. In the United Kingdom, FMT regulation is under the remit of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.  Medical uses = Clostridioides difficile infection  Clostridioides difficile 01 Fecal microbiota transplant is approximately 85‚Äì90% effective in people with CDI for whom antibiotics have not worked or in whom the disease recurs following antibiotics. Most people with CDI recover with one FMT treatment. A 2009 study found that fecal microbiota transplant was an effective and simple procedure that was more cost-effective than continued antibiotic administration and reduced the incidence of antibiotic resistance. Once considered to be a \\"last resort therapy\\" by some medical professionals, due to its unusual nature and invasiveness compared with antibiotics, perceived potential risk of infection transmission, and lack of Medicare coverage for donor stool, position statements by specialists in infectious diseases and other societies have been moving toward acceptance of FMT as a standard therapy for relapsing CDI and also Medicare coverage in the United States. It has been recommended that endoscopic FMT be elevated to first-line treatment for people with deterioration and severe relapsing C. difficile infection.  Other conditions  In May 1988, Australian professor Thomas Borody treated the first ulcerative colitis patient using FMT, which led to longstanding symptom resolution. Following on from that, Bennet published the first case report documenting reversal of Bennet's own colitis using FMT. While C. difficile is easily eradicated with a single FMT infusion, this generally appears to not be the case with ulcerative colitis. Published experience of ulcerative colitis treatment with FMT largely shows that multiple and recurrent infusions are required to achieve prolonged remission or cure.  Adverse effects  Adverse effects were poorly understood as of 2016. They have included bacterial blood infections, fever, SIRS-like syndrome, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease in people who also had that condition, and mild GI distress which generally resolve themselves soon after the procedure, including flatulence, diarrhea, irregular bowel movements, abdominal distension/bloating, abdominal pain/tenderness, constipation, cramping, and nausea. There are also concerns that it may spread COVID-19. A person died in the United States in 2019 after receiving an FMT that contained drug-resistant bacteria and another person who received the same transplant was also infected. The FDA issued a warning against potentially life-threatening consequences of transplanting material from improperly screened donors.  Technique  There are evidence-based consensus guidelines for the optimal administration of FMT. Such documents outline the FMT procedure, including preparation of material, donor selection and screening, and FMT administration. The gut microbiota comprises all microorganisms that reside along the gastrointestinal tract, including commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic organisms. FMT is the transfer of fecal material containing bacteria and natural antibacterials from a healthy individual into a diseased recipient.  Donor selection  Preparing for the procedure requires careful selection and screening of the potential donor. Close relatives are often chosen on account of ease of screening; however, in the case of treatment of active C. diff., family members and intimate contacts may be more prone to be carriers themselves. This screening involves medical history questionnaires, screening for various chronic medical diseases (e.g. irritable bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, gastrointestinal cancer, etc.), and laboratory testing for pathogenic gastrointestinal infections (e.g. CMV, C. diff., salmonella, Giardia, GI parasites, etc.).  Specimen preparation  No laboratory standards have been agreed upon, so recommendations vary for size of sample to be prepared, ranging from of fecal material for effective treatment. Fresh stool is used to increase viability of bacteria within the stool and samples are prepared within 6‚Äì8 hours. The sample is then diluted with 2.5‚Äì5 times the volume of the sample with either normal saline, sterile water, or 4% milk. Some locations mix the sample and the solvent with a mortar and pestle, and others use a blender. There is concern with blender use on account of the introduction of air which may decrease efficacy as well as aerosolization of the feces contaminating the preparation area. The suspension is then strained through a filter and transferred to an administration container. If the suspension is to be used later, it can be frozen after being diluted with 10% glycerol, and used without loss of efficacy compared to the fresh sample. The fecal transplant material is then prepared and administered in a clinical environment to ensure that precautions are taken.  Administration  After being made into suspensions, the fecal material can be given through nasogastric and nasoduodenal tubes, or through a colonoscope or as a retention enema.  Mechanism of action  One hypothesis behind fecal microbiota transplant rests on the concept of bacterial interference, i.e., using harmless bacteria to displace pathogenic organisms, such as by competitive niche exclusion. In the case of CDI, the C. difficile pathogen is identifiable. Recently, in a pilot study of five patients, sterile fecal filtrate was demonstrated to be of comparable efficacy to conventional FMT in the treatment of recurrent CDI. The conclusion from this study was that soluble filtrate components (such as bacteriophages, metabolites, and/or bacterial components, such as enzymes) may be the key mediators of FMT's efficacy, rather than intact bacteria. It has now been demonstrated that the short-chain fatty acid valerate is restored in human fecal samples from CDI patients and a bioreactor model of recurrent CDI by FMT, but not by antibiotic cessation alone; as such, this may be a key mediator of FMT's efficacy. Other studies have identified rapid-onset but well-maintained changes in the gut bacteriophage profile after successful FMT (with colonisation of the recipient with donor bacteriophages), and this is therefore another key area of interest. In contrast, in the case of other conditions such as ulcerative colitis, no single culprit has yet been identified. However, analysis of gut microbiome and metabonome changes after FMT as treatment for ulcerative colitis has identified some possible candidates of interest.  History  The concept of treating colon diseases with fecal matter originated in India. Charak Samhita and many other ancient Ayurveda text that date back to more than 3,000 years recommend intake of cow dung and cow urine for multiple stomach-related disorders. Fourth-century Chinese medical literature also mentions use of fecal matter to treat food poisoning and severe diarrhea. Twelve hundred years later Ming dynasty physician Li Shizhen used \\"yellow soup\\" (aka \\"golden syrup\\") which contained fresh, dry or fermented stool to treat abdominal diseases. \\"Yellow soup\\" was made of fecal matter and water, which was drunk by the person. The consumption of \\"fresh, warm camel feces\\" has also been recommended by Bedouins as a remedy for bacterial dysentery; its efficacy probably attributable to the antimicrobial subtilisin produced by Bacillus subtilis was anecdotally confirmed by German soldiers of the Afrika Korps during World War II. The first use of FMT in western medicine was published in 1958 by Ben Eiseman and colleagues, a team of surgeons from Colorado, who treated four critically ill people with fulminant pseudomembranous colitis (before C. difficile was the known cause) using fecal enemas, which resulted in a rapid return to health. For over two decades, FMT has been provided as a treatment option at the Centre for Digestive Diseases in Five Dock, by Thomas Borody, the modern-day proponent of FMT. In May 1988 their group treated the first ulcerative colitis patient using FMT, which resulted in complete resolution of all signs and symptoms long term. In 1989 they treated a total of 55 patients with constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease with FMT. After FMT, 20 patients were considered \\"cured\\" and a further 9 patients had a reduction in symptoms. Stool transplants are considered about 90 percent effective in those with severe cases of Clostridium difficile colonization, in whom antibiotics have not worked. The first randomized controlled trial in Clostridium difficile infection was published in January 2013. The study was stopped early due to the effectiveness of FMT, with 81% of patients achieving cure after a single infusion and over 90% achieving a cure after a second infusion. Since that time various institutions have offered FMT as a therapeutic option for a variety of conditions.  Society and culture = Regulation  Interest in FMT grew in 2012 and 2013, as measured by the number of clinical trials and scientific publications. In the United States, the FDA announced in February 2013 that it would hold a public meeting entitled \\"Fecal Microbiota for Transplantation\\" which was held on May 2‚Äì3, 2013., February 25, 2013 In May 2013 the FDA also announced that it had been regulating human fecal material as a drug. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) sought clarification, and the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) stated that FMT falls within the definition of a biological product as defined in the Public Health Service Act and the definition of a drug within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It argued since FMT is used to prevent, treat, or cure a disease or condition, and intended to affect the structure or any function of the body, \\"a product for such use\\" would require an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. In July 2013, the FDA issued an enforcement policy (\\"guidance\\") regarding the IND requirement for using FMT to treat C. difficile infection unresponsive to standard therapies (, July 18, 2013). In March 2014, the FDA issued a proposed update (called \\"draft guidance\\") that, when finalized, is intended to supersede the July 2013 enforcement policy for FMT to treat C. difficile infections unresponsive to standard therapies. It proposed an interim discretionary enforcement period, if 1) informed consent is used, mentioning investigational aspect and risks, 2) stool donor is known to either the person with the condition or physician, and 3) stool donor and stool are screened and tested under the direction of the physician (, February 26, 2014). Some doctors and people who want to use FMT have been worried that the proposal, if finalized, would shutter the handful of stool banks which have sprung up, using anonymous donors and ship to providers hundreds of miles away.. FMT for recurrent C. difficile infections can be done without mandatory donor and stool screening, whereas FMT for other indications cannot be performed without an IND. The FDA has issued three safety alerts regarding the transmission of pathogens. The first safety alert, issued in June of 2019, described the transmission of a multidrug resistant organism from a donor stool that resulted in the death of one person. The second safety alert, issued in March of 2020, was regarding FMT produced from improperly tested donor stools from a stool bank which resulted in several people hospitalizations and two deaths. A safety alert in late March, 2020, was due to concerns of transmission of COVID-19 in donor stool. To date, there are no FDA-approved FMT products available in the United States.  Stool banks  In 2012, a team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology founded OpenBiome, the first public stool bank in the United States Across Europe, numerous stool banks have emerged to serve the increasing demand. While consensus rapports exists, standard operation procedures still differ. Institutions in the Netherlands have published their protocols for managing FMT, and in Denmark institutions manages FMT according to the European Tissue and Cell directive.  Research  Cultured intestinal bacteria are being studied as an alternative to fecal microbiota transplant. One example is the rectal bacteriotherapy (RBT), developed by Tvede and Helms, containing 12 individually cultured strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria originating from healthy human faeces. Research has also been done to identify the most relevant microbes within fecal transplants, which could then be isolated and manufactured via industrial fermentation; such standardized products would be more scalable, would reduce the risk of infections from unwanted microbes, and would improve the scientific study of the approach, since the same substance would be administered each time.  Veterinary use  Elephants, hippos, koalas, and pandas are born with sterile intestines, and to digest vegetation need bacteria which they obtain by eating their mothers' feces, a practice termed coprophagia. Other animals eat dung. In veterinary medicine fecal microbiota transplant has been known as \\"transfaunation\\" and is used to treat ruminating animals, like cows and sheep, by feeding rumen contents of a healthy animal to another individual of the same species in order to colonize its gastrointestinal tract with normal bacteria.  Terminology  Previous terms for the procedure include fecal bacteriotherapy, fecal transfusion, fecal transplant, stool transplant, fecal enema, and human probiotic infusion (HPI). Because the procedure involves the complete restoration of the entire fecal microbiota, not just a single agent or combination of agents, these terms have now been replaced by the new term fecal microbiota transplantation.

He was a notable parliamentarian and chaired the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations. He is the longest-serving member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Missouri. Biography Born in Elsberry, Missouri, the son of John Randolph Cannon, a farmer and merchant, and Ida Glovina Whiteside. Reflecting his family's influence and his rural, border-state background, Cannon maintained a lifelong devotion to the Southern Baptist faith and the Democratic party. He also possessed a firm belief in the superiority of the agrarian lifestyle and small-town values. In 1901, Cannon graduated from La Grange Junior College (now known as Hannibal-LaGrange College) in Hannibal, Missouri, from William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri in 1903, and from the law school of the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1908. After working as a high school teacher and principal, he served as an instructor of history at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri from 1904 to 1908. Though he retained a lifelong interest in the American past and wrote several books on family and local history, Cannon deemed the academic life too sedentary. Accordingly, he studied law at the University of Missouri while teaching at Stephens College. He earned an LL.B. and joined the bar in 1908. He established a law practice in Troy, Missouri, but soon transferred it to his home town of Elsberry. Cannon was initiated into the Alpha-Omega chapter of the Kappa Sigma fraternity while an undergraduate at William Jewell in 1903. In 1906, Cannon married Ida Dawson Wigginton; they had two daughters. The couple formed a close working relationship. Ida Cannon became her husband's most trusted political adviser. Starting in the 1920s, she traveled extensively over the back-country roads of northeastern Missouri campaigning for her spouse, while he remained at his congressional desk in Washington, D.C. Politics Cannon eagerly sought elective office, but his first two campaigns, for county school superintendent and state representative, ended in defeat. His political fortunes changed after his congressman, Champ Clark, hired him as a confidential secretary in 1911. When Democrats elected Clark Speaker of the House that year, Cannon found himself near the center of power in Washington. Enjoying Clark's patronage, Cannon advanced to the positions of House journal clerk from 1914 to 1917 and House parliamentarian from 1917 to 1920. A quick study, he rapidly established himself as a leading authority on parliamentary procedure. His skills proved so impressive that the Republicans retained him after winning the House in 1918. In 1920 he became parliamentarian of the Democratic National Convention, a position he held through 1960. Cannon exercised lasting influence over the workings of Congress through publications such as Procedure in the House of Representatives (1920) and Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives (1936). After resigning as House parliamentarian, Cannon returned to his law practice in Elsberry. Clark was defeated by Republican Theodore W. Hukriede in the 1920 Republican landslide. Cannon challenged Hukriede for his mentor's seat in the House of Representatives in 1922 and won. Popular with his constituents, he repeatedly won reelection, often without opposition, until his death. Years in Congress Heeding the concerns of his rural district, Cannon emerged as a leading advocate of agricultural interests. He supported parity payments to maintain farmers' incomes, low-interest federal farm loans, and soil conservation and flood control projects. The latter two were of special concern in Cannon's district, and one of the congressman's most enduring legacies involved securing federal funding for what eventually became the Clarence Cannon Dam and Reservoir in northeastern Missouri. Cannon also played a major role in the establishment of the rural electrification program and in obtaining government funds for agricultural research. \\"No farm legislation was approved by Congress during the Cannon years,\\" a contemporary observer noted, \\"that did not bear the impress of Cannon's knowledge of parliamentary procedure and his influence in Congress.\\" With the notable exception of farm supports, the Missourian primarily gained a reputation as a budget-slashing fiscal conservative, especially after he became chair of the House Appropriations Committee in 1941. Cannon retained this powerful position, except for four years of Republican control, until his death. He urged a quick reduction in military expenditures immediately after World War II, denounced foreign aid as waste, and ridiculed the space program as \\"moondoggle\\" (the word had been coined by Norbert Wiener). Cannon's desire to hold tight the nation's purse strings grew with the years. In 1962, he bitterly denounced the first \\"$100-billion Congress\\" in a much-publicized speech on the House floor, angering House Speaker John W. McCormack and other fellow Democrats. Always outspoken, sometimes irascible, Cannon earned a reputation for pugnacity. He once lampooned a fellow House member, \\"Of all the 'piddlin' politicians that ever piddled 'piddlin' politics on this floor, my esteemed friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin, is the greatest piddler that ever piddled.\\" During an argument in 1945, Cannon punched in the face Representative John Taber of New York, the ranking Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee. Cannon noted gleefully that Taber ran out of the room with a bleeding lip. In 1962, Cannon engaged in an unseemly and well- publicized dispute with U.S. Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona, another octogenarian Democrat, over obscure matters of parliamentary precedent. In 1955, Cannon bypassed several more senior Democrats to appoint Otto Passman of Monroe, Louisiana, as the chairman of the pivotal House Foreign Operations Subcommittee, with jurisdiction over foreign aid. A long-term critic of most foreign-aid expenditures, Passman said at a meeting at the Eisenhower White House that \\"never in the history of the world has the mind of man conceived such an unreasonable and unworkable program\\" as foreign aid.Billy Hathorn, \\"Otto Passman, Jerry Huckaby, and Frank Spooner: The Louisiana Fifth Congressional District Campaign of 1976\\", Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Vol. LIV, No. 3 (Summer 2013), p. 335 Cannon did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, but voted present on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Cannon's irascibility extended beyond the halls of Congress. In January 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy wrote to him expressing her appreciation for his help in establishing the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, adding, \\"I know the fight was not easy.\\" Cannon retorted to the recently widowed first lady: \\"You say the fight was not easy, but on the contrary, we had cooperation from everyone. It was done practically by acclamation.\\" Death Cannon died of heart failure at the Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C.Rep. Clarence Cannon Dies Suddenly Tuesday; Joplin Globe; Joplin, Missouri; Page 1; May 13, 1964 He had already announced his intention to seek reelection later in the year. His lengthy service in Congress made him an influential if somewhat contradictory representative. During his 41-year congressional career, he served well his rural Missouri constituents, securing passage of farm supports and funding for local projects that some critics denounced as \\"pork barrel\\" politics. At the same time, he advocated stricter fiscal responsibility in other branches of the federal government. Beyond the scope of legislation, Cannon's publications on congressional procedure have achieved the status of holy writ for successive generations of lawmakers. His contributions to agricultural and appropriation policies and parliamentary procedure, enhanced by his colorful personality, have ensured him a place as one of the major congressional figures of the twentieth century. Legacy Cannon was the author of A Synopsis of the Procedure of the House (1918), Procedure in the House of Representatives (1920), and Cannon‚Äôs Procedure (1928), subsequent editions of the latter being published periodically by resolutions of the House until 1963. He was the editor and compiler of Precedents of the House of Representatives (Cannon's Precedents) by an act of Congress. He also served as regent of the Smithsonian Institution from 1935 to 1964. He is interred in Elsberry City Cemetery, Elsberry, Missouri. The Clarence Cannon Dam, in Ralls County, Missouri, creating Mark Twain Lake, is named in his honor due to his involvement in securing funding for the dam's construction. For several years the airport in Kirksville, Missouri was known as Clarence Cannon Memorial Airport. However, in the 1980s the name was changed to Kirksville Regional Airport. The terminal is still known as the Clarence Cannon terminal in honor of his role in securing and maintaining commercial air service to Kirksville.A Book of Adair County History, Published by the Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976. A high school athletic conference that serves much of his former district is known as the Clarence Cannon Conference. A National Wildlife Refuge near Annada, Missouri also bears his name: the Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge.

Whitlock (1813-1878) was an American blackface performer. He began his career in entertainment doing blackface banjo routines in circuses and dime shows, and by 1843, he was well known in New York City. He is best known for his role in forming the original minstrel show troupe, the Virginia Minstrels. Early career Whitlock was born in New York City in 1813. He worked as a typesetter for a religious journal, then went to work for the New York Herald. Whitlock claimed to have met America's pre-eminent banjoist, Joel Sweeney, in 1838 and to have taken some banjo lessons from him. He joined P. T. Barnum's circus in 1839, where he began his blackface act. By 1840, Whitlock was performing circuses, museums, and variety shows and had taken the epithet \\"King of Banjo players, and the Emperor of Extravaganza Singers\\".18 July 1840. Announcement from Vauxhall Gardens in the New York Morning Herald. Quoted in Nathan 65. He paired with John Diamond for a time, playing banjo and singing while Diamond danced. Frank Lynch eventually replaced Diamond, though he took \\"Frank Diamond\\" as his stage name. Whitlock also partnered with Dan Gardner, who would dress in drag as Whitlock's character \\"Sambo Squash\\" made romantic overtures. This playbill, written in the stereotyped African American Vernacular English that characterized blackface entertainment, describes Whitlock's basic act: > Now dat Massa Whitlock plays so partic'lar combustious, and will sing dat > 'fecting song of Jinny git your Hoe Cake done! and dat first rate ballad of > Jim Along Josey! defying all de niggers in de world to charm de people after > dat same manner.

Quoted in Nathan > 115. Many years later, Whitlock claimed that his Negro impersonations were based on reality. He would \\"quietly steal off to some negro hut to hear the darkeys sing and see them dance, taking with him a jug of whiskey to make them all the merrier.\\"April 13, 1878. New York Clipper. Quoted in Emerson 97. Virginia Minstrels In early 1843, Whitlock became one of the founding members of the Virginia Minstrels. Whitlock's version of the group's founding holds that Whitlock asked fiddler Dan Emmett to practice with him. They did so on a few occasions, but during one such session, Frank Brower dropped by unannounced and decided to join in on bones. Richard Pelham soon followed with his tambourine.April 13, 1878. New York Clipper. Quoted in Nathan 116‚Äì17. The Virginia Minstrels put on a full minstrel show at the New York Bowery Amphitheatre on 6 February 1843. Whitlock was the most famous of the foursome,Nathan 115. but soon all four names became well known as they toured New York and Boston. Whitlock's banjo was long-necked and four-stringed, though a fifth was added by 1844. He played the instrument by striking the strings with his fingernail.Nathan 126. Whitlock also did a \\"Locomotive Lecture\\", a predecessor to the stump speech, wherein he feigned a complete lack of knowledge about steam engines and the railroad. Whitlock wrote some music, as well; his \\"Miss Lucy Long\\" became a hit for both the Virginia Minstrels and Christy's Minstrels.Emerson 94. Whitlock and the troupe left for Liverpool, on April 21. They performed several minstrel shows in the British Isles, but they broke up after a performance on July 14, 1843, possibly due to low profits. Whitlock returned to New York City with the group's manager, George Wooldridge. Later career Back in America, Whitlock returned to his circus blackface act. For a time, he joined T. G. Booth, Cool White, and Barney Williams as a member of the Kentucky Minstrels. On July 28, 1845, Whitlock joined Emmett, Jerry Bryant's Minstrels, Dan Gardner, and Charles \\"Charlie\\" White to form the Operatic Brothers and Sisters. The group put on a week of outdoor performances in Hoboken, New Jersey. On October 23, he performed at a benefit concert along with Emmett, Gardner, and other prominent blackface entertainers. His last public blackface performance was at a circus in 1855.Stark 20. NotesReferences * Crawford, Richard (2001). America's Musical Life: A History. W. W.

The Columbus club, a member of the Association continuously since 1902, was previously known as the Columbus Senators ‚Äî a typical appellation for a team based in a state (or national) capital. It was independently and locally owned through the 1920s. The economic distress of the Great Depression was accompanied by the rise of the farm system ‚Äî pioneered by the St. Louis Cardinals' Branch Rickey. The Cardinals purchased minor league teams at all levels to develop their talent as if on an assembly line, and when they needed a second top-level farm club (St. Louis already owned the Rochester Red Wings of the International League), they purchased the struggling Senators club and dubbed it the Red Birds, a popular nickname for the big-league club. The first business manager of the Red Birds was a baseball novice named Larry MacPhail. A bold promoter, he supervised the building of Redbird Stadium, championed night baseball games, and tried to make baseball more fan-friendly. Attendance tripled between 1930 and 1932. MacPhail left Columbus after a dispute with the Cardinals' ownership, and moved up to Major League Baseball as the general manager of three teams between 1933 and 1947, and earned a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The 1933 Red Birds were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. Columbus produced a number of great players, including Hall of Famers Enos Slaughter and Billy Southworth. Slaughter (who batted .382 for the 1937 Red Birds with 245 hits), and won Association titles in 1933, 1934, 1937, 1941‚Äì43 and 1950. Southworth managed the 1932 Red Birds. In the early 1950s a series of losing teams, and the encroachment of television, depressed the Red Birds' attendance, and the club moved to Omaha, Nebraska, for the 1955 season and was re-christened the Omaha Cardinals. Columbus immediately gained a new AAA team when the Ottawa A's franchise of the International League began playing there in 1955. This club, the Columbus Jets, moved to Charleston, West Virginia, in 1970. Ohio's capital was without baseball for seven years until 1977, when the Columbus Clippers joined the IL. The Clippers have played there ever since, most notably as the longtime AAA affiliate (1979‚Äì2006) of the New York Yankees. After a two-year stint as the Washington Nationals' top affiliate, in 2009 they became the AAA affiliate of the Cleveland Indians.

Accessed June 2, 2011. \\"Andover-born singer/songwriter Rob Freeman‚Ä¶\\") is the guitarist, backing vocalist and primary songwriter for the pop punk/post- hardcore group Hidden in Plain View. He owns/works at The Pilot Studio as a record producer, recording various up and coming artists. Biography=Hidden in Plain View Upon forming in August 2000, Hidden in Plain View began playing concerts somewhat frequently, in hopes of being able to make a living out of their music. Freeman, from Stanhope, New Jersey, joined other musicians from North Jersey in establishing the band.Woliver, Robbie. \\"MUSIC; For Punk Band, Success Counts\\", The New York Times, April 1, 2011. Accessed October 9, 2015. \\"The band members -- Chris Amato, 23, bass player of Chatham; Joe Reo, 20, vocalist of Stanhope; Bob Freeman, 19, guitarist vocalist and songwriter of Stanhope; Kenny Ryan, 19, guitarist of Long Valley; Derek Reilly, 18, drummer of Rockaway -- have no qualms about acting in ways that their peers might view as selling out, as long as they get their music heard.\\" After graduating high school, the band released their debut EP Find (2001) independently and their sophomore EP Operation: Cut-Throat (2002) on Note to Self Records and re-released by LLR Recordings, while the number of fans attending their shows increased steadily. Following several line-up changes, Drive-Thru Records signed the band in June 2003 and released their four-song sampler EP Hidden in Plain View on November 11, 2003. In spite of being criticized for its lack of variety, the EP was a perfect showcase of the band's continuous development of both musicianship and songwriting. With more sophisticated lyrics, a heavier undertone in the instrumentation and a discreet nod to contemporary screamo in the vocals, it served as a promising prelude to their following full-length album. In mid-2004, Hidden in Plain View went into the studio with producer Jim Wirt to record their full-length debut Life in Dreaming. Song structures were far more diverse on this effort -- featuring riff heavy anthems as well as melancholy ballads -- as were the lyrical topics, dealing with the pressure of growing up (\\"American Classic\\"), the experience of losing a close friend (\\"In Memory\\") and the controversial subject of date rape (\\"Bleed for You\\"). Life in Dreaming was also the first of the band's records that integrated Freeman as a full vocalist with almost as many parts as lead vocalist Reo in certain songs, such as \\"A Minor Detail\\", \\"Garden Statement\\" and \\"Top 5 Addictions\\". The follow-up album to Life in Dreaming was recorded in 2006 and planned for a release somewhen in 2007. On January 29, 2007, it was announced via the label's website that the band had broken up. Record production In 2004 Freeman's studio took on the name The Pilot Studio when he began producing a variety of projects between and sometimes during a busy touring schedule. The Pilot Due to the considerable difference between the number of songs Hidden in Plain View's schedule allows them to record and the number of songs Freeman writes, he decided to put his recording studio to good use by starting a solo project under the name The Pilot. As of December 2006, The Pilot has released ten songs on his PureVolume and MySpace profiles (\\"This So Called Life\\", \\"Miss Mirage\\", \\"The Distance I Know\\", \\"Good Enough\\", \\"Home Away from Home\\", \\"Day In and Day Out\\", \\"5 Years in the Making\\", \\"You Verse Me Verse the World\\", \\"White Noise\\", and \\"Believe What You Will\\"), though it is unknown whether they will ever be issued on a CD, or if he will continue making them available for free download. Musically, Freeman's solo project does not differ drastically from his work with Hidden in Plain View. It is safe to say that The Pilot songs are far less punk influenced, featuring more sensitive lyrics and acoustic instruments such as acoustic guitars, the piano and even strings. Often accompanied by drum machines, his songs are synthesized -- yet not to an extent as predominant in power pop, let alone electronica songs -- and at times bear close resemblance to some of Jimmy Eat World's more mellow songs. Accompanied by Thomas J. Chipmen on guitar, Freeman played his first acoustic concert under The Pilot moniker on October 28, 2006 at Bloomfield Ave Cafe in Montclair, New Jersey. Shortly afterwards, guitarist/bassist Jason Jaksetic was announced as the first official member of The Pilot, besides Freeman. An East Coast tour supporting Houston Calls is scheduled for December 2006.

Lauria's 40 Angevin galleys were at Naples when 32 Sicilian galleys under d'Oria arrived and challenged him to come out. For the first time he refused, probably because of a lack of confidence in his Angevin crews, and d'Oria ravaged some offshore islands. This allowed 12 Apulian galleys to arrive from the south and seven Genoese galleys to arrive also, and join Lauria's fleet, making 59 galleys. Now Lauria emerged and found the Sicilians near Zannone Island to the west. After d'Oria dismissed a suggestion to retreat, he tried a quick attack on Lauria's flag-galley and the banner- carrying galleys, his own galley running alongside Lauria's, \\"head to toe\\", and Lauria's crew suffered even though his galley couldn't be boarded. One Sicilian galley fled after capturing one of Lauria's galleys, and it was followed by six more. Five Genoese Ghibelline galleys held back, awaiting fortune, and 18-29 (two sources give 28, but this adds up to too many) Sicilian galleys were captured, d'Oria's being the last to surrender (when Lauria threatened to burn it).

It is situated on the A528 Shrewsbury-Ellesmere road and is roughly north of Shrewsbury. After a history of being its own parish, it currently lies in the parish of Pimhill. According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the parish population of Pimhill was 2008, with the number of these habiting in Albrighton being 273. It is first mentioned in the Domesday Book, as Etbritone (\\"ƒíadbeorht‚Äôs settlement\\"). Albright Hussey was once part of the same manor, and indeed shared the same name originally. History Until 1886, Albrighton was traditionally a chapelry in the parish of Shrewsbury St. Mary, because of the close proximity, along with other small local villages Wollascott and Leaton. As well as being in the Hundred of Pimhill, Albrighton used to be its own parish. Albrighton civil parish succeeded its status as a chapelry, after being created in 1866. Over time, the parish would vary in size, and in April 1934 after the Salop Review Order, there were major boundary changes around Shropshire, with Albrighton being enlarged by 965 acres by the abolition of Battlefield and Shrewsbury St. Alkmund. However the parish became abolished in 1967, just over a hundred years since its creation. The abolition of Albrighton was to enlarge the current administrative parishes of Pimhill and Astley after The Salop (No.2) Order, 1966. After this, Albrighton became part of the parish of Pimhill. The church in the village is dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and is a stone building in the early Norman style. According to The Church of England, it was built in 1840 and opened for the first time a year later. It is described by John Marius Wilson, the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as \\"a very good church.\\" In contemporary society it hosts regular events. Albrighton‚Äôs earliest population figures date back to the late 19th century, when in 1881 the population stood at 102. After turn of the century the population began to decline, with figures reaching as little as 77 in 1931. However, after this there was a sharp increase in the population with the 1961 census showing 248. This is supported by the number of houses being built after 1930, with the increase being more than threefold. One reason for this might be because the first council houses were built in Shrewsbury in between the wars, as part of the 1930s slum clearance. Registers The Albrighton Registers can tell us a lot about the village's history as they record all information such as baptisms and burials in St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury. They date back to 1563, but despite this the earliest volume has been lost. The first existing volume was likely to have begun in 1666, by William Hughes, who aimed to keep baptisms and burials separate, but this was soon given up. It lasted all the way until 1790, however even this is in a bad condition, with many pages being torn. A much shorter second volume also exists, but this ends in 1812. The transcripts of the registers are all now preserved in St. Mary's church. Occupation A pie chart to show the male occupation in Albrighton in 1831 In the past, Shropshire's economy was fuelled by agricultural activities, and the area of Pimhill Hundred was no different. Traditionally, Pimhill was very agricultural, with 1831 census data showing that over half the male population worked in this industry. The pie chart positioned to the left shows how male occupation in Pimhill was divided in 1831. The retail and handcraft industry made up a quarter of the occupation. Albrighton‚Äôs earliest occupational data dates back to the late 19th century, with the 1881 census providing information. The occupational data from this time shows many of the males being engaged in agriculture, which reflects the same as the earlier information obtained about Pimhill. Also, the figures show that females were mainly engaged in domestic services or office jobs. Geography=Population A line graph showing the population in Albrighton between 1881‚Äì1961Total number of houses in Albrighton between 1881 ‚Äì 1961 The population of Albrighton never showed any major fluctuations at the turn of the nineteenth century to the twentieth. The first major increase was recorded in the 1951 census, when the population had tripled from the previous census, undertaken before World War II. The total number of houses in Albrighton is shown in the adjacent table, and this also shows a great increase to coincide with the rising population. Nationally the whole population rose during this time because of the post war baby boom. However, the increase is explained by a great increase in housing production in Shropshire in the 1930s, and with the majority of Shropshire not being bombed in World War II the housing production could increase. With the population of Albrighton in 2001, being 273, the population has only risen by 25 people since the 1961 census, which could be a result of improved life expectancy. Governance As Albrighton lies in the civil parish of Pimhill, it is part of the Shrewsbury and Atcham Parliamentary constituency. In the 2019 elections Daniel Kawczynski retained his seat as a Conservative Member of Parliament. Furthermore, in Pimhill there are also local parish council elections for thirteen councillors, where Albrighton has one councillor, Malcolm Pete, who is also a member of the Conservative Party. Climate The nearest weather station to Albrighton is located in Shawbury, which is the main weather station for the whole of Shropshire. This is just over six miles away from Albrighton in a North- Easterly direction. The climate for Shropshire is very similar throughout, where locally the coldest nights around Shawbury fall to ‚àí9.6c. With Albrighton being a village, temperatures could be lower than the average. Furthermore, the average rainfall in a year is expected to reach around 65 cm, however, despite this Shropshire in 2012 has been declared a drought zone with the worst water shortage since 1976. Transport As well as being located close to the county town of Shropshire, Albrighton is just under 50 miles away from Birmingham, the closest major city, and is located just over 150 miles north-west to the capital city of London. The closest train station to Albrighton is Shrewsbury railway station, which has direct links to many places, including Manchester, Wrexham, Crewe and London via Birmingham. Albrighton is located on the A528 Shrewsbury-Ellesmere road. There is a bus stop in the village opposite the Albrighton Hall Hotel, with an infrequent service to Shrewsbury and Ellesmere provided by Lakeside Coaches.https://lakesidecoaches.co.uk/service/ Local Amenities *Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hall Hotel & Spa, located 0.3 miles away from the main village, is a 300-year-old mansion, with a spectacular ornamental lake. *Albright Hussey Manor, is located 1.1miles away from Albrighton.

Central to the great era of American museum-sponsored Egyptian excavations, Winlock's work contributed greatly to Egyptology's development, in particular, his reconstruction of the royal lineage of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. Much of the Met's collection of Egyptian artefacts comes from his archaeological expeditions, particularly his excavations at Thebes, where he worked for many years on the excavations at the funerary temple of Hatshepshut.Metropolitan Museum of New York, Temple of Hatshepsut, Thebes. His father, William Crawford Winlock, was an assistant secretary at the Smithsonian Institution. Winlock graduated from Harvard before becoming the youngest member of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art‚Äôs expedition to the royal necropolis at El-Lisht 25 miles south of Cairo in 1906. He was later transferred to the Kharga Oasis 100 miles west of Luxor, where he helped restore a temple of the god Amun. In 1911 Winlock began excavating the mortuary complex of the 11th Dynasty pharaoh Mentuhotep II (2010‚Äì1998 B.C.) at Deir el-Bahri in the Valley of the Kings, where he discovered the bodies of 60 soldiers slain in battle and buried in linen shrouds decorated with the cartouche of Pharaoh Mentuhotep II.H. E. Winlock, The Slain Soldiers of Neb- Hepet-Re Mentu-Hotpe. The Metropolitan Museum Digital collections. On March 17, 1920, Winlock discovered the tomb of Mentuhotep II's prime minister Meketre, in which he found many wooden tomb models.Metropolitan Museum of New York, Tombs of Meketre and Wah, Thebes. Winlock‚Äôs work at Deir el-Bahri concluded his career in the field; in 1932, upon returning to the U.S., he was named the director of the Metropolitan Museum. As his eulogist remarked following his death in 1950, Winlock had the rare ability to ‚Äú‚Äòretroject himself\\" into a past civilisation and make some of it come alive again for his contemporaries.\\" Winlock was instrumental in the design of the Metropolitan Museum's spectacular Dig House, close to the Valley of the Kings, where he spent the winters, accompanied by his wife, the artist Helen Chandler Winlock, and his young daughters Frances and Barbara. Most often known as 'the American House' it was the headquarters for Winlock and his distinguished team of archaeologists, several of whom were seconded to work on the tomb of Tutankhamun once it was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922. Winlock was closely involved in that discovery and, as a close friend of Carter's, became caught up in the deception and political controversy that built up once the tomb had been opened. In the wake of the Depression, funds for excavating in Egypt began to dry up, and the annual digs at Thebes ceased. Winlock returned to New York and to the Metropolitan. He served as director of the Met from 1932 until his retirement in 1939 and remained director emeritus until his death.

Its purpose was to provide assistance to American pioneers and new immigrants who became stranded on their journeys. At his death in 1851, Mullanphy left a bequest of one half million dollars in his will to help \\"aid travelers going west.\\" By the 20th century, Travelers Aid Societies had sprung up in major cities across the country. The programs protected stranded travelers, especially women and children, from others who would use, abuse, or victimize them. The primary fear was that young women travelers, native born and immigrant alike, would be kidnapped and turned into \\"white slaves\\" (defined as white women forced into prostitution). Therefore, Travelers Aid Societies, most notably the Travelers Aid Society of New York, provided social work to vulnerable travelers at train stations and piers in order to prevent their falling victim to the white slave trade and related vices. Although many of the Travelers Aid programs were started by religious communities, services were often provided regardless of beliefs. It is the oldest non-religious social welfare organization in the United States. The founder of the Travelers Aid Society of New York (TAS-NY), Grace Hoadley Dodge, had hoped to unite other Travelers Aid Societies to form a national association, but she died in 1914 before this could be accomplished. Due primarily to the efforts of TAS-NY General Secretary Orin Clarkson Baker, national unification was finally accomplished in 1917. This national association provided a \\"chain of service\\", with one agency helping another when inter-city transportation of a client was required. Travelers Aid was one of the original \\"United Service Organizations\\" (USO) that provided assistance to traveling service men and women, operating 175 troop transit lounges. Today, Travelers Aid responds to the specific needs of the community. Although each member agency shares the original service of assisting stranded travelers, many Travelers Aid agencies provide shelter for the homeless, transitional housing, job training, counseling, local transportation assistance, and other programs. Similar organizations were founded in other countries; in Great Britain and many other countries spelled as \\"Travellers' Aid Society\\", and originally closely associated with the YWCA.

The title of the game also translates into English as \\"Undersea (or \\"Underwater\\") Treasure Hunting\\" or ‚ÄúSea Hunt‚Äù. Gameplay Gameplay Use the 2-way joystick to direct the boat across the surface of the ocean, then press the button to lower the diver down to the bottom of the ocean while watching out for the sharks swimming across the screen. During this time, you can hold the button to pause the diver's descent and push the joystick in either direction to fire a harpoon at the sharks for 30-300 points apiece. Once the diver has reached the bottom of the ocean, push the joystick in either direction to make him walk towards either of the two treasure caches that are closest to him (the boat will automatically follow his movements at this point). When the diver is directly over a treasure cache, the boat will lower him into it. The number of points you will receive when you make it back onto the surface of the ocean, which can range from 50-250, will then appear on the screen, and the boat will raise the diver back up to the surface of the ocean. Once again, you can hold the button to pause the diver's ascent, and push the joystick in either direction to fire a harpoon at the sharks. Once you have made it back up to the surface of the ocean, you will have to repeat the entire process for each of the four remaining treasure caches before the game proceeds to the next round.

It runs upon the Namco Galaxian hardware, based on the Z80 microprocessor, with an extra Zilog Z80 microprocessor to drive a DAC for speech; it was one of the first games to have speech synthesis. An MSX port was released in Japan in 1984. Gameplay Screenshot The player controls two green men with an orange cannon, stationed on the parapet of a castle, that fires at a fleet of hot-air balloons. Below the cannon, the King moves slowly back and forth on the ground as the balloons return fire and dive toward him. If a balloon reaches the ground, it will sit there until the King walks into it, at which time it lifts off with him. The player must then shoot the balloon to free the King, who will parachute safely to the ground. At times, two of more diving balloons can combine to form a single larger one, which awards extra points and splits apart when hit. The cannon is destroyed by collision with balloons or their shots, but is replaced after a brief delay with no effect on the number of remaining lives. One life is lost whenever a balloon carries the King off the top of the screen; the game ends when all lives are lost. As in Galaxian, the round number stops increasing at round 48. Voice The King speaks when he is captured (\\"HELP!\\"), when he is rescued (\\"THANK YOU\\"), and when he is carried away (\\"BYE BYE!\\"). The balloons make the same droning sound as the aliens from Galaxian, released in the previous year, and the cannon's shots also make the same sound as those of the player's ship (the \\"Galaxip\\") from the very same game. In the original Japanese version of the game, the King speaks English with a heavy Japanese accent, saying \\"herupu\\" (\\"help!\\"), \\"sanky≈´\\" (\\"thank you\\"), and \\"baibai\\" (\\"bye bye!\\"). The U.S. version of the game features a different voice for the King without the Japanese accent. Legacy King & Balloon was later featured in Namco Museum Encore for the PlayStation, as Japan-only release. It made its North American console debut on Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, in which the player could choose the King's voice (original Japanese or later U.S. version) after unlocking the manic settings. It also appeared in Namco Museum Virtual Arcade for the Xbox 360, as well as Namco Museum Megamix for the Wii.

Adjacent to Gallatin National Forest and near Yellowstone National Park, the refuge is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Red Rock Lakes is best known for being the primary location for the efforts saving the trumpeter swan from extinction, which by 1932 had fewer than 200 known specimens in the United States and Canada. By the year 2002, an estimated 3,000 trumpeters were wintering on the refuge, many having migrated south from their summer range in Canada. The trumpeters are now so plentiful that efforts are being undertaken to help them reestablish historical migratory routes to areas further south in the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin region. The elegant trumpeter swan is North America's largest waterfowl, with a wingspans of 8 feet (2.6 m) and they can weigh up to 30 pounds (13 kg). Whooping cranes The altitude of the refuge ranges from 6,600 feet (2,000 m) to almost 10,000 feet (3,000 m) and consists of 65,810.25 acres (266.32 km2)USFWS Lands Report, 30 September 2007 of high altitude prairie and forested uplands. The lakes and cold water marshlands provide a relatively uncommon wetland environment favored by certain waterfowl and predatory birds such as the bald eagle and peregrine falcon. There have been sightings of over 250 different bird species in the refuge and over 100 different species are known to nest here. There are reportedly 20 nesting pairs of bald eagles on the refuge, and there have been several sightings of the endangered whooping crane. Numerous mammals can also be found here such as the American black bear, the Rocky Mountain elk, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, beaver, mink and badger. It is also believed that the grizzly bear and wolf packs may frequent the refuge, and wolverine have been recorded. The refuge has been designated a National Natural Landmark and the creation of the 32,350 acre (130.1 km2) Red Rock Lakes Wilderness in 1976 ensures that no further human improvements will be undertaken on the vast bulk of the refuge land. There are no maintained trails in the refuge and access to some areas is prohibited during certain times of the year.

In the early 1900s, books were housed in a building near what is now the intersection of Highways 27 and 89. Over the years, the library moved several times and was run by different boards until 1964. At that time the library board moved the books to the present location, then known as the Veterans Hall. Following the 1991 amalgamation process, Cookstown Public Library became a branch of the Innisfil Public Library system. The first board meeting of the Lefroy Library Board took place in 1902 at the Ancient Order of the United Workmans Hall. Mrs. T. Sproule was hired as librarian and the library was opened in her home in Lefroy on the northwest corner of Church Street and Concession 4. The library made one other move in Lefroy before moving to the James Sloan building in Churchill in 1912. Miss Mary Sloan was appointed librarian in 1915, and served as librarian there for 64 years, before retiring in 1978. The Churchill library moved several times until the Innisfil Central Library, now referred to as the Churchill branch, officially opened in 1974. The Stroud library, founded by the Stroud Women‚Äôs Institute, was located in Chantler‚Äôs General Store in 1912. The library moved through many buildings in Stroud, including the Orange Hall in 1950, and the basement of the old municipal offices in 1957. The library opened in its current location, the Stroud Recreation Complex, December 22, 1975. In the 1990s, there was a push to give the fast-growing community of Alcona a library. Even though there was support in principle for a library in the community, there was no budget funding to make a library happen. The community rallied, and a small private library, funded by a dedicated group of volunteers, was opened in 1994. The goal of the Innisfil Library Board, as recommended in the Fox Jones Study, was to give the community a municipally funded library. The council approved funds for the building of a new library in Alcona in 2000. Tenders went out, decisions were made, a huge fund-raising campaign \\"The Spirit of Our Community\\" was initiated, and after several delays, the new Lakeshore branch was officially opened in October 2001.

History Coat of arms of London County Council on gates The first building on the site was designed by George Gwilt the Elder and opened as the Surrey County Sessions House in 1791. It was adjacent to the Horsemonger Lane Gaol which was also designed by Gwilt. Important cases in the 19th century included the trial of the Reverend Robert Taylor who was convicted of blasphemy at the Surrey County Sessions in April 1831 and then committed to Horsemonger Lane Gaol. The gaol was demolished in 1881 and replaced by a public park, Newington Gardens, which opened in 1884. Following local government re-organisation in 1889, the London County Council inherited the Middlesex Sessions House, which was no longer in Middlesex, and the Surrey County Sessions House, which was no longer in Surrey. For a while the London county leaders decided to share the judicial work out between the two locations. After deciding this arrangement was inadequate for their needs, the justices decided to close the Middlesex Sessions House and rebuild the Newington Causeway Sessions House so that it could accommodate the extra judicial workload being transferred from Middlesex Sessions House. Meanwhile the Surrey county leaders established new administrative facilities for themselves at County Hall in Kingston upon Thames in November 1893. The new and expanded Sessions House was designed by the London county architect, W. E. Riley, in the classical style and was completed in 1921. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of eleven bays facing Newington Causeway with the end three bays on each side slightly projected forwards; the central section of five bays featured an arched doorway with a pediment above; there were pedimented round headed windows on the first floor and small square windows on the second floor. The building was designated as a Crown Court venue in 1971 and was extended in 1974 to provide ten courts for use on the South Eastern Circuit. Recent cases at the courthouse have included the trial following the Upton Park riot in August 2009: eighty people suspected of violence before and after the match were arrested and several West Ham fans were convicted in the courthouse of violent disorder in April 2010, receiving prison sentences, including one of 20 months.

Structure The structure of the inner mitochondrial membrane is extensively folded and compartmentalized. The numerous invaginations of the membrane are called cristae, separated by crista junctions from the inner boundary membrane juxtaposed to the outer membrane. Cristae significantly increases the total membrane surface area compared to a smooth inner membrane and thereby the available working space. The inner membrane creates two compartments. The region between the inner and outer membrane, called the intermembrane space which is largely continuous with the cytosol, and the more sequestered space inside the inner membrane, called matrix.  Cristae  For typical liver mitochondria, the area of the inner membrane is about 5 times as large as the outer membrane due to cristae. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. Cristae membranes are studded on the matrix side with small round protein complexes known as F1 particles, the site of proton-gradient driven ATP synthesis. Cristae affect overall chemiosmotic function of mitochondria.  Cristae junctions  Cristae and the inner boundary membranes are separated by junctions. The end of cristae are partially closed by transmembrane protein complexes that bind head to head and link opposing crista membranes in a bottleneck-like fashion. For example, deletion of the junction protein MIC60/Mic60 (formerly Mitofilin/Fcj1) leads to a reduced inner membrane potential and impaired growth and to dramatically aberrant inner membrane structures which form concentric stacks instead of the typical invaginations. Composition The inner membrane of mitochondria is similar in lipid composition to the membrane of bacteria. This phenomenon can be explained by the endosymbiont hypothesis of the origin of mitochondria as prokaryotes internalized by a eukaryotic host cell. In pig heart mitochondria, phosphatidylethanolamine makes up the majority of the inner mitochondrial membrane at 37.0% of the phospholipid composition. Phosphatidylcholine makes up about 26.5%, cardiolipin 25.4%, and phosphatidylinositol 4.5%. In S. cerevisiae mitochondria, phosphatidylcholine makes up 38.4% of the IMM, phosphatidylethanolamine makes up 24.0%, phosphatidylinositol 16.2%, cardiolipin 16.1%, phosphatidylserine 3.8%, and phosphatidic acid 1.5%. In the inner mitochondrial membrane, the protein-to-lipid ratio is 80:20, in contrast to the outer membrane, which is 50:50. Permeability The inner membrane is freely permeable to oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water only. It is much less permeable to ions and small molecules than the outer membrane, creating compartments by separating the matrix from the cytosolic environment. This compartmentalization is a necessary feature for metabolism. The inner mitochondrial membrane is both an electrical insulator and chemical barrier. Sophisticated ion transporters exist to allow specific molecules to cross this barrier. There are several antiport systems embedded in the inner membrane, allowing exchange of anions between the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix.

It is run entirely by student volunteers from the Schools of Social Work, Public Health, Physical Therapy, Pharmacy, Nursing, Medicine, and Dentistry. The students, under the supervision of UNC doctors and professors, combine their skills to hold weekly dental and health clinics, provide rapid HIV testing services, and create sustainable community health promotion programs. Wednesday Night Clinic In 2004, the Coalition saw 740 patients, more than 600 of whom came from the immediate surroundings of Chapel Hill, Carrboro, and Durham. Of the total seen, 83% reported that they were not insured, and that the clinic was their only source of primary care. Since its establishment in 1968, SHAC has attempted to redress differences in health indices between minorities and North Carolina‚Äôs Caucasian population; in 2004, almost 60% of the patients seen were Hispanic, and the majority of patients seen had at most a high-school-level of education. Education and outreach In addition to providing basic medical services, the Coalition performs the essential function of educating patients about healthy behaviors. The organization relies heavily on the training and resources available to its public health students for one-on-one patient counseling regarding diet, exercise, smoking cessation and sexual health. Annual educational and disease screening projects include well child clinics, Fiesta del Pueblo, and work at several other health fairs, including FestiFall, Apple Chill, and Effland‚Äôs Octoberfest. Ongoing outreach projects include diabetic foot clinics in Hurdle Mills and nutrition education and cooking sessions at Carrboro‚Äôs Club Nova. HIV testing and counseling SHAC also provides free, no-needle, rapid HIV testing services by trained counselors. HIV/AIDS education and personalized risk reduction is provided for all clients through pre- and post-test counseling. HIV testing is available for clinic patients and walk-in clients. In 2007, it tested over 400 people. The Coalition also provides services for those that test positive. It has firm links to both UNC Infectious Disease Clinic and social services for HIV positive people. Pediatric healthcare The Coalition receives and implements grants from North Carolina's branch of Reach Out and Read, which the organization uses to educate patients about child literacy and to provide pediatric patients with free reading materials. In 2004, SHAC performed clinic referrals for over a third of the patients seen, a fact which indicates the organization‚Äôs interest in connecting the patients it serves with other established medical organizations. It is also dedicated to integrating its patients into the existing primary healthcare system, and has been enrolling patients in the State Children's Health Insurance Program for several years.

There are a number of different styles of weaving, which variously create a braided cord ranging from very flat to almost entirely rounded. cords are used as , cords worn belted around the front of some when wearing kimono. History braids were first created by using fingerloop braiding to weave different yarns together. Later, tools such as the and the were developed, allowing more complex braids to be woven in a shorter amount of time. In the present day, modern variations of weaving discs exist, typically made of firm, dense foam with roughly 32 notches around the edge, creating the tension necessary for weaving . These discs are considered to be a more affordable and portable alternative to a traditional , with many different sizes and shapes of disc available for purchase. However, a modern foam disc is also considered less versatile than a traditional , as the weaver is constrained to using no more than 32 different yarns, with their thickness predetermined by the width of the notch. also allow the weaver to create braids that are flat, four sided or hollow in nature, though rectangular foam discs, allowing the weaver to create a flat braid, do exist.

By intussusception a new blood vessel is created by splitting of an existing blood vessel in two. Intussusception occurs in normal development as well as in pathologic conditions involving wound healing, tissue regeneration, inflammation as colitis or myocarditis, lung fibrosis, and tumors amongst others. Intussusception was first observed in neonatal rats. In this type of vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the lumen to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the endothelial cell junctions are reorganized and the vessel bilayer is perforated to allow growth factors and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the two new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with pericytes and myofibroblasts. These cells begin laying collagen fibers into the core to provide an extracellular matrix for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception is important because it is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast increase in the number of capillaries without a corresponding increase in the number of endothelial cells. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich microvasculature with new cells every time a new vessel develops.  Research  In a small study comparing the lungs of patients who had died from Covid-19 to those that had died from influenza A pneumonia (H1N1) to uninfected controls during autopsy; there was a significantly greater density of intussusceptive angiogenic features in the lungs of patients who had died from Covid-19 as compared to influenza A and the control group. The degree of intussusceptive angiogenic features in the lungs from the Covid-19 patients were also found to be greater as the length of hospitalization increased (which was not seen in the influenza or control groups). This suggests that increased or enhanced intussusceptive angiogeneis is seen in Covid-19 and may play a role in pathogenesis.  References  *Mentzer SJ, Konerding MA.

It is not a diagnosis for the DSM-5, but is rather a symptom of many mental disorders. On suicide risk scales, the range of suicidal ideation varies from fleeting thoughts to detailed planning. Most people who have suicidal thoughts do not go on to make suicide attempts, but suicidal thoughts are considered a risk factor. During 2008‚Äì09, an estimated 8.3 million adults aged 18 and over in the United States, or 3.7% of the adult U.S. population, reported having suicidal thoughts in the previous year. An estimated 2.2 million in the U.S. reported having made suicide plans in 2014. Suicidal thoughts are also common among teenagers. Suicidal ideation is generally associated with depression and other mood disorders; however, it seems to have associations with many other mental disorders, life events, and family events, all of which may increase the risk of suicidal ideation. There are a number of treatment options for those experiencing suicidal ideation. Terminology Other terms for suicidal ideation include suicidalness,Roca- Cuberes, Carles. \\"Diagnosing as an Interactional Achievement in Psychiatric Interviews.\\" The Palgrave Handbook of Adult Mental Health. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2016. 191-208. suicidal thoughts, suicidal impulse, suicidal compulsions,Glover, Mark. \\"The Heiligenstadt Testament: Beethoven's Therapeutic Estate Planning Experience.\\" (2012). suicidalism,Money, John. \\"Prefatory remarks on outcome of sex reassignment in 24 cases of transexualism.\\" Archives of sexual behavior 1.2 (1971): 163-165. and suicidality. When someone who has not shown a history of suicidal ideation experiences a sudden and pronounced thought of performing an act which would necessarily lead to their own death, psychologists call this an intrusive thought. A commonly experienced example of this is the high place phenomenon, also referred to as the call of the void.Demont, Marc, and Of Male Friendship. \\"Gender Studies: Masculinity Studies.\\" The urge to jump is called \\"mountain fever\\" in Brian Biggs' book Dear Julia. Euphemisms related to mortal contemplation include internal struggle, voluntary death, and eating one's gun. Signs and symptoms The way out or Suicidal Ideation George Grie (2007) Suicidal ideation is a symptom for many mental disorders. The DSM-5 defines it as \\"thoughts about self-harm, with deliberate consideration or planning of possible techniques of causing one's own death.\\" Some symptoms or comorbid conditions may include unintentional weight loss, feeling helpless, feeling alone, excessive fatigue, low self-esteem, presence of consistent mania, excessively talkative, intent on previously dormant goals, feel like one's mind is racing.American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author. The onset of symptoms like these with an inability to get rid of or cope with their effects, a possible form of psychological inflexibility, is one possible trait associated with suicidal ideation. They may also cause psychological distress, which is another symptom associated with suicidal ideation. Risk factors=Scales * Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation * Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk * Suicidal Affect‚ÄìBehavior‚ÄìCognition Scale (SABCS) * Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale There are numerous indicators that one can look for when trying to detect suicidal ideation. There are also situations in which the risk for suicidal ideation may be heightened. The risk factors for suicidal ideation can be divided into three categories: psychiatric disorders, life events, and family history. Psychiatric disorders There are several psychiatric disorders that appear to be comorbid with suicidal ideation or considerably increase the risk of suicidal ideation. For example, many individuals with borderline personality disorder exhibit recurrent suicidal behavior and suicidal thoughts. One study found that 73% of patients with borderline personality disorder have attempted suicide, with the average patient having 3.4 attempts. The following list includes the disorders that have been shown to be the strongest predictors of suicidal ideation. These are not the only disorders that can increase risk of suicidal ideation. The disorders in which risk is increased the greatest include: * Anxiety disorders * Autism spectrum disorder * Major depressive disorder * Dysthymia * Bipolar disorder * Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) * Personality disorders * Psychosis (detachment from reality) * Paranoia * Schizophrenia * Substance use disorders, inhalant use disorder * Body dysmorphic disorder * Nightmare disorder * Gender dysphoria * Conduct disorder * Specific learning disorder Medication side effects Some medications, such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can have suicidal ideation as a side effect. Moreover, these drugs' intended effects, can themselves have unintended consequence of an increased individual risk and collective rate of suicidal behavior: Among the set of persons taking the medication, a subset feel bad enough to want to attempt suicide (or to desire the perceived results of suicide) but are inhibited by depression-induced symptoms, such as lack of energy and motivation, from following through with an attempt. Among this subset, a \\"sub-subset\\" may find that the medication alleviates their physiological symptoms (such as lack of energy) and secondary psychological symptoms (e.g., lack of motivation) before or at lower doses than it alleviates their primary psychological symptom of depressed mood. Among this group of persons, the desire for suicide or its effects persists even as major obstacles to suicidal action are removed, with the effect that the incidences of suicide attempt and of completed suicide increase. Life events Life events are strong predictors of increased risk for suicidal ideation. Furthermore, life events can also lead to or be comorbid with the previous listed psychiatric disorders and predict suicidal ideation through those means. Life events that adults and children face can be dissimilar and for this reason, the list of events that increase risk can vary in adults and children. The life events that have been shown to increase risk most significantly are * Alcohol abuse ** Studies have shown that individuals who binge drink, rather than drink socially, tend to have higher rates of suicidal ideation **Certain studies associate those who experience suicidal ideation with higher alcohol consumption **Not only do some studies show that solitary binge drinking can increase suicidal ideation, but there is a positive feedback relationship causing those who have more suicidal ideation to have more drinks per day in a solitary environment *Minoritized gender expression and/or sexuality * Unemployment * Chronic illness or pain * Death of family members or friends * End of a relationship or being rejected by a romantic interest *Major change in life standard (e.g. relocation abroad) * Other studies have found that tobacco use is correlated with depression and suicidal ideation * Unplanned pregnancy * Bullying, including cyberbullying and workplace bullying * Previous suicide attempts ** Having previously attempted suicide is one of the strongest indicators of future suicidal ideation or suicide attempts * Military experience ** Military personnel who show symptoms of PTSD, major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder show higher levels of suicidal ideation * Community violence * Undesired changes in body weight ** Women: increased BMI increases chance of suicidal ideation ** Men: severe decrease in BMI increases chance of suicidal ideation *** In general, the obese population has increased odds of suicidal ideation in relation to individuals that are of average-weight * Exposure and attention to suicide related images or words Family history * Parents with a history of depression ** Valenstein et al. studied 340 adult offspring whose parents had depression in the past. They found that 7% of the offspring had suicidal ideation in the previous month alone * Abuse ** Childhood: physical, emotional and sexual abuse ** Adolescence: physical, emotional and sexual abuse * Family violence * Childhood residential instability **Certain studies associate those who experience suicidal ideation with family disruption. Relationships with parents and friends According to a study conducted by Ruth X. Liu of San Diego State University, a significant connection was found between the parent‚Äìchild relationships of adolescents in early, middle and late adolescence and their likelihood of suicidal ideation. The study consisted of measuring relationships between mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, mothers and sons, and fathers and daughters. The relationships between fathers and sons during early and middle adolescence show an inverse relationship to suicidal ideation. Closeness with the father in late adolescence is \\"significantly related to suicidal ideation\\". Liu goes on to explain the relationship found between closeness with the opposite sex parent and the child's risk of suicidal thoughts. It was found that boys are better protected from suicidal ideation if they are close to their mothers through early and late adolescence; whereas girls are better protected by having a close relationship with their father during middle adolescence. An article published in 2010 by Zappulla and Pace found that suicidal ideation in adolescent boys is exacerbated by detachment from the parents when depression is already present in the child. Lifetime prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation among nonclinical populations of adolescents generally range from 60% and in many cases its severity increases the risk of completed suicide. Prevention Crisis hotlines, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, enable people to get immediate emergency telephone counselling Early detection and treatment are the best ways to prevent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. If signs, symptoms, or risk factors are detected early then the individual might seek treatment and help before attempting to take their own life. In a study of individuals who did commit suicide, 91% of them likely suffered from one or more mental illnesses. However, only 35% of those individuals were treated or being treated for a mental illness. This emphasizes the importance of early detection; if a mental illness is detected, it can be treated and controlled to help prevent suicide attempts. Another study investigated strictly suicidal ideation in adolescents. This study found that depression symptoms in adolescents early as 9th grade is a predictor of suicidal ideation. Most people with long-term suicidal ideation do not seek professional help. The previously mentioned studies point out the difficulty that mental health professionals have in motivating individuals to seek and continue treatment. Ways to increase the number of individuals who seek treatment may include: * Increasing the availability of therapy treatment in early stage * Increasing the public's knowledge on when psychiatric help may be beneficial to them ** Those who have adverse life conditions seem to have just as much risk of suicide as those with mental illness A study conducted by researchers in Australia set out to determine a course of early detection for suicidal ideation in teens stating that \\"risks associated with suicidality require an immediate focus on diminishing self-harming cognitions so as to ensure safety before attending to the underlying etiology of the behavior\\". A Psychological Distress scale known as the K10 was administered monthly to a random sample of individuals. According to the results among the 9.9% of individuals who reported \\"psychological distress (all categories)\\" 5.1% of the same participants reported suicidal ideation. Participants who scored \\"very high\\" on the Psychological Distress scale \\"were 77 times more likely to report suicidal ideation than those in the low category\\". In a one-year study conducted in Finland, 41% of the patients who later committed suicide saw a health care professional, most seeing a psychiatrist. Of those, only 22% discussed suicidal intent on their last office visit. In most of the cases, the office visit took place within a week of the suicide, and most of the victims had a diagnosed depressive disorder. There are many centers where one can receive aid in the fight against suicidal ideation and suicide. Hemelrijk et al. (2012) found evidence that assisting people with suicidal ideation via the internet versus more direct forms such as phone conversations has a greater effect. Treatment Treatment of suicidal ideation can be problematic due to the fact that several medications have actually been linked to increasing or causing suicidal ideation in patients. Therefore, several alternative means of treating suicidal ideation are often used. The main treatments include: therapy, hospitalization, outpatient treatment, and medication or other modalities. Therapy In psychotherapy a person explores the issues that make them feel suicidal and learns skills to help manage emotions more effectively. Hospitalization Hospitalization allows the patient to be in a secure, supervised environment to prevent the suicidal ideation from turning into suicide attempts. In most cases, individuals have the freedom to choose which treatment they see fit for themselves. However, there are several circumstances in which individuals can be hospitalized involuntarily. These circumstances are: * If an individual poses danger to self or others * If an individual is unable to care for oneself Hospitalization may also be a treatment option if an individual: * Has access to lethal means (e.g., a firearm or a stockpile of pills) * Does not have social support or people to supervise them * Has a suicide plan * Has symptoms of a psychiatric disorder (e.g., psychosis, mania, etc.) Outpatient treatment Outpatient treatment allows individuals to remain at their place of residence and receive treatment when needed or on a scheduled basis. Being at home may improve quality of life for some patients, because they will have access to their personal belongings, and be able to come and go freely. Before allowing patients the freedom that comes with outpatient treatment, physicians evaluate several factors of the patient. These factors include the patient's level of social support, impulse control and quality of judgment. After the patient passes the evaluation, they are often asked to consent to a \\"no-harm contract\\". This is a contract formulated by the physician and the family of the patient. Within the contract, the patient agrees not to harm themself, to continue their visits with the physician, and to contact the physician in times of need. There is some debate as to whether \\"no-harm\\" contracts are effective. These patients are then checked on routinely to assure they are maintaining their contract and avoiding dangerous activities (drinking alcohol, driving fast, and not wearing a seat belt, etc.). Medication Prescribing medication to treat suicidal ideation can be difficult. One reason for this is that many medications lift patients' energy levels before lifting their mood. This puts them at greater risk of following through with attempting suicide. Additionally, if a person has a comorbid psychiatric disorder, it may be difficult to find a medication that addresses both the psychiatric disorder and suicidal ideation. Antidepressants may be effective. Often, SSRIs are used instead of TCAs as the latter typically have greater harm in overdose. Antidepressants have been shown to be a very effective means of treating suicidal ideation. One correlational study compared mortality rates due to suicide to the use of SSRI antidepressants within certain counties. The counties which had higher SSRI use had a significantly lower number of deaths caused by suicide. Additionally, an experimental study followed depressed patients for one year. During the first six months of that year, the patients were examined for suicidal behavior including suicidal ideation. The patients were then prescribed antidepressants for the six months following the first six observatory months. During the six months of treatment, experimenters found suicide ideation reduced from 47% of patients down to 14% of patients. Thus, it appears from current research that antidepressants have a helpful effect on the reduction of suicidal ideation. Although research is largely in favor of the use of antidepressants for the treatment of suicidal ideation, in some cases antidepressants are claimed to be the cause of suicidal ideation. Upon the start of using antidepressants, many clinicians will note that sometimes the sudden onset of suicidal ideation may accompany treatment. This has caused the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue a warning stating that sometimes the use of antidepressants may actually increase the thoughts of suicidal ideation. Medical studies have found antidepressants help treat cases of suicidal ideation and work especially well with psychological therapy. Lithium reduces the risk of suicide in people with mood disorders. Tentative evidence finds clozapine in people with schizophrenia reduces the risk of suicide.

An amended construction was filed January 15, 1941, but was finally granted by the FCC on June 12, 1947 with its new frequency of 92.3 MHz in the new FM band.WPRO-FM's history card; retrieved January 9, 2019. WPRO-FM began broadcasting on April 17, 1948.1994 Providence Journal-Bulletin Almanac, p. 251. It was owned by Cherry & Webb Broadcasting Company which in turn was owned by the Cherry & Webb Department Store. (In the early days of broadcasting, it was common for department stores to own radio stations, to provide programming for customers who bought receivers.) At first, WPRO-FM simulcast its AM sister station, WPRO (630 AM). In 1959, Capital Cities Communications acquired both WPRO and WPRO-FM. Through the 1960s and early 1970s, WPRO-FM aired a beautiful music format, while WPRO AM enjoyed high ratings with a Top 40 format. On April 29, 1974, at 3:00 p.m., WPRO-FM changed formats from easy listening, joining its AM counterpart as a Top 40 outlet.Video of WPRO-FM's 40-year celebration of being a Top 40 station. Retrieved August 25, 2014. Over time, the AM moved toward an Adult Top 40 direction, adding more information and service features, while WPRO-FM continued as a music-intensive Top 40 outlet. Capital Cities and ABC merged in 1985, and WPRO-AM-FM were then under the ownership of one of America's biggest broadcasting companies. In December 1992, Capital Cities/ABC announced that the stations would be sold to Tele-Media, with the sale being consummated the following April.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-03-04.pdf This put the station under common ownership with WLKW (the former WEAN) and WWLI. Tele-Media, in turn, sold its stations to Citadel Broadcasting in 1997. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. WPRO-FM is unique in the Providence media market in keeping the same call sign since its sign-on in 1948; and the same format, Top 40, since 1974.

The current station, opened on 23 February 2009, replaces an earlier one dating from 1879, first closed on 18 April 1966 but reopened between 1987 and 1990. Plans for the current station, opposite the original, were approved in late 2007. It opened with just one daily train each way on Mondays to Fridays. The full current service of hourly trains to and from London began on 27 April 2009, after East Midlands Trains had taken delivery of the additional trains needed for its implementation. History The Midland Railway opened Corby station in 1879. It was on the Midland's 'alternative route' between and , serving Corby, and , instead of , and Loughborough. The station was initially named \\"Weldon and Corby\\" to avoid confusion with Corby Glen station in Lincolnshire, which closed in 1959. British Railways (BR) withdrew passenger services from all stations on the Oakham to Kettering Line, including Corby, in May 1967. For some decades, Corby was one of the largest towns in Europe without a railway station (claimed as the largest in an episode of Series C of BBC TV show QI in 2005); only a few, such as Herten in Germany and ≈Åom≈ºa in Poland, are larger. BR kept the Oakham to Kettering line through Corby open for freight and as a diversionary route. It reduced the southern end of the line, from Glendon Junction (near Kettering) to Corby, to single track in 1986 after the closure of the town's steel works saw freight traffic levels decline. On 13 April 1987, a passenger service of 11 shuttle trains daily between Corby and , usually operated by a single DMU, was reintroduced with local council subsidy. More than 100,000 people used the service within the first 12 months and an extension to Leicester was proposed. However, the service became unreliable and the council withdrew its subsidy, leading Network Southeast to withdraw the service on 2 June 1990. The briefly used 1987 station, seen here in 1990 shortly before closure. Reopening=Proposals The East Midlands Branch of the independent campaign group Railfuture proposed that the Kettering ‚Äî Corby line should be included in a cross-country ‚Äî service, but this was not implemented. In 2001, Midland Mainline, the rail operator of the Midland Main Line franchise, decided against building a new station for Corby. In 2003, Corby's urban regeneration company, Catalyst Corby, announced plans to build a new station by 2011. In June 2006, the Department for Transport (DfT) told prospective bidders for the new East Midlands rail franchise (combining Midland Main Line services from London and the eastern section of the Central Trains network) that they would have to include in their tenders a price for a service to a new station in Corby. The DfT's East Midlands rail franchise consultation noted that Corby had been targeted for substantial housing growth over the course of the franchise and the provision of a station would be in line with the Sustainable Communities Plan. A new service could be created as an extension of the hourly London to Kettering service. Announcements The new station at Corby, looking south. The platform of the 1987 station can be seen on the right. In April 2007, Network Rail announced that it had allocated ¬£1.2-million towards the rebuilding of the station as a response to housing and jobs growth in the county. A final decision on the station, planned to be open by December 2008, would be made by the Department for Transport. On 22 June, the DfT confirmed that Stagecoach had won the franchise and revealed that the company ‚Äì operating as East Midlands Trains (EMT) ‚Äì would run an extra hourly London to Kettering service, with the possibility of extending this to a new station in Corby and putting Corby within 75 minutes of central London. An article in the June 2008 edition of Modern Railways, produced in cooperation with EMT, suggested that, from December 2008, Corby could be served by trains leaving St Pancras for Kettering at 8 minutes past each hour. However, pending the removal of infrastructure constraints ‚Äì notably, the need to reinstate a third track between Wellingborough and Kettering and raise the line speed between Corby and Kettering ‚Äì an hourly through-service to and from Corby would have been unfeasible initially, trains being unable to make the run from Kettering to Corby and back within the projected timings. Therefore, with the possible exception of some peak-time services, the connection to and from Corby would have to be provided mostly by a shuttle service, with a change of trains at Kettering. For this, EMT would need to lease additional rolling stock, speculated to be Class 222 stock cascaded from Hull Trains. In addition, DfT approval of the hourly Kettering service was still awaited. Services had been due to start on 14 December 2008, but EMT admitted that it had yet to secure agreement with the DfT and the rolling stock company (ROSCO) for the four additional trains needed. EMT then announced that services would not commence until 20 March 2009. The station's opening was then brought forward to 23 February 2009, but with a very limited interim timetable of one train to London and back each day. EMT promised that more services would begin once an additional three trains had become available. On 7 April 2009, East Midlands Trains announced that the full hourly service (13 trains each way) would begin from Monday 27 April 2009. Transport secretary Geoff Hoon presided over the official opening of the station on 30 April 2009, with hourly passenger trains to London and a limited northbound service. Design and construction Site clearance works in March 2008. The platform from the old station can just be seen at the right of the picture, below some 'British Rail lights', from the period when the station was briefly open in the 1980s. The North Northants Development Company and English Partnerships submitted plans for the design of the station in late July 2007 and detailed planning permission was granted by the Council in November. The Development Company predicted that the new station would unlock an estimated ¬£200-million of further commercial investment in Corby, creating more than 1,200 jobs. It added that the station would also provide added impetus for residential development and aid the transformation of town centre shopping and civic facilities.Regeneration & Renewal, \\"Green Light for Corby train station after 17 years\\", 29 June 2007, p. 2. The project cost ¬£8.3 million, and construction began in June 2008, following the conclusion of an agreement with Kettering construction firm Mainline Contractors. The station was built at Station Road, adjacent to the site of the old station, to act as a transport interchange for Corby, with bus and taxi facilities being relocated there.ING Media, \\"Green light for new train station signals major boost for on-going renaissance of Corby\\", 22 June 2007. A new road was planned to lead into the interchange, which would also have a 140-space car park, taxi rank, drop-off and pick-up areas and a bus area. Site clearance works began in March 2008 and were completed in the summer. The station is the third to be built to the modular station design developed by Network Rail, following and . There has been criticism of the design by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment that: An artist's impression of the station was on the website of the local MP, Phil Hope. In June 2009, it was announced that the station had won the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation's Award for Effective Partnerships and received praise for having been built on time, within budget and to a high standard. Services Trains run about once every hour between Corby and Kettering, seven days per week, with most services continuing to London St Pancras. EMR operates a limited service from via (for East Midlands Airport), Melton Mowbray and Oakham, and one northbound service to Melton Mowbray. The possibility of extending further services was being explored for implementation from 2010. Future It is planned that a half-hourly London St Pancras to Corby service will be operated by East Midlands Railway from May 2021https://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/transport/big-changes-kettering- wellingborough-and-corby-train-services-delayed-until-next-year-2904630 using Class 360 electric trains, once the Midland Main Line has been electrified beyond as part of the Electric Spine project.

Originally part of AMD's 50x15 Initiative, the PIC has been deployed by Internet service providers (ISPs) in several developing countries. It is based on an AMD Geode CPU and uses Microsoft Windows CE and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6. The fanless PC runs the low-power Geode x86 processor and is equipped with 128 MB DDR memory and a 10 GB 3.5-inch hard drive. The device's price is $185 with a keyboard, mouse, and preinstalled software for basic personal computing and internet/email access and $249 with a monitor included. Transfer to Data Evolution Corporation AMD stopped work on the Personal Internet Communicator project after nearly two years of planning and development. In December 2006 AMD transferred PIC manufacturing assets to Data Evolution Corporation and the device was then marketed as the decTOP. The PIC is branded, marketed, and sold by local service providers such as telecommunications companies and government-sponsored communications programs. AMD owns the design of the PIC, but the device is currently manufactured by Solectron, a high volume contract manufacturing specialist. Other companies integrated into the development include Seagate and Samsung. The ISPs include the Tata Group (India), CRC (M√©xico), Telmex (M√©xico), and Cable and Wireless (in the Caribbean).

Therefore, it is not possible to format and re-install any other operating system. Any attempts to install a different OS, even when extracting the disk from the main chassis fail, since BIOS would look for WinCE's main boot file. = Operating system= AMD's PIC 50x15 was originally delivered with Windows CE 5.0 pre-installed in two partitions. The working (bootable) partition was allowed to boot normally, but when it failed, the BIOS would recover the partition's base-installation from a backup recovery disk in a small partition in the disk. When re-flashed with a more forgiving BIOS, the decTOP allows the user to install any x86-compatible operating system desired (32 bits only). It is known to work with any Linux distribution, as well as Windows XP and other versions. However, upgrading the unit's main memory to 512 MBytes is recommended for reliable operation.

Etymology The word Malappuram means \\"terraced place atop the hills\\" or simply \\"hilltop\\", derived from the general geographical characteristics of the city.Travel Guide from native planetCultural Malappuram  Financial Express Downhill, Malappuram  History  Malappuram was a military headquarters from ancient times through the ancient history of the city is hardly seen recorded. However, there are some pre-historic relics, particularly Rock-cut caves found in some parts of the city like Oorakam, Melmuri, Ponmala, Vengara etc. manifesting the inhabitancy. Locality named like Valiyangadi, Kootilangadi, Pallipuram etc. points to the Jain - Buddhist history of Malappuram. Notably, the 1500-year-old Jain Temple above 2000 ft sea level at Oorakam Hill of Malappuram undoubtedly proves the same. During the Sangam period, Eranadan Malappuram was under the Chera Empire. Places like Pattar Kadav, Panakkad, etc. are possibly evolved out of Pattars and Panars having lived there. But no further details are available about the life and culture of the people either during the Sangam age or in the post-Sangam age. Archaeological relics found in Malappuram also include the remnants of palaces of the eastern branch of the Zamorin reign. Malappuram was the military headquarters of the Zamorin in the Eranad region. The Zamorins held sway over Malappuram and their chieftain Para Nambi, ruled the area in early days with headquarters at Downhill (Kottappadi), Malappuram. Details of the rulers of erstwhile Malappuram, who were the ancestors of later Zamorins, figure in the Jewish copper plates of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (1000 AD) and in the Kottayam copper plates of Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (1225 AD). The later history of the city is interwoven with the history of Zamorin's rule. During the colonial era, Malappuram was the headquarters of European and British troops and it later became the headquarters of the Malabar Special Police (M.S.P) formerly known as Malappuram Special Force formed in 1885 The British established the Haigh Barracks on top of the hill of Malappuram, at the bank of the Kadalundi river to station their forces, where once Tipu had a fort.

The village is adjacent to Pevensey five miles (8 km) north- east of Eastbourne. The parish consists of three settlements: Westham; Stone Cross; and Hankham. The parish is virtually part of the Greater Eastbourne conurbation, and much expansion has been occurring here: hence the large population. History Although overshadowed by its close neighbour, Pevensey, Westham is recorded in the Domesday Book. Its name derives from being a hamlet to the west of Pevensey Castle. Governance The parish council has thirteen elected members.Parish council members 2007 Geography The parish lies along a ridge at the western end of the Pevensey Levels, the area once an inlet of the sea. The main village centre, Westham, is at the eastern end of the parish, and is virtually coterminous with Pevensey village. DemographyEconomyLandmarks Stone Cross is the home to a windmill which is located on high ground in the village. This tower mill was built between 1875 and 1876, the last of the type built in Sussex. Although ceasing commercial operation in 1937, it has since been refurbished and is open to the public.Stone Cross windmill It is a Grade II* listed building. Pevensey Levels, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, lies partially in the parish. The site is of biological interest consisting of low-lying grazing meadows, hosting a wide variety of wetland flora and fauna. Transport The village is served by Pevensey and Westham railway station on the East Coastway Line. The A27 trunk road crosses the parish from west to east. Education There are three primary schools serving the parish: Pevensey and Westham School; Hankham County Primary School; and Stone Cross School.School in the parish Religious sites ‚ÄòWestham Church from Pevensey Castle looking west‚Äô by Lewis Pinhorn WoodThere are two churches in the civil parish.Churches in Westham The 11th-century St Mary's church at WesthamSt Mary‚Äôs Westham is reputed to be the first Norman church in England, although the church at Bramber also claims that title. St Mary's is depicted in a number of paintings by the Victorian landscapist Lewis Pinhorn Wood (1848-1918), including 'Westham Church from Pevensey Castle looking West'. St Luke's parish church at Stone Cross (also serving the settlement of North Langney)St Luke's Church is a more recent building of 1926; it stands at a crossroads near the windmill. The church fell into disrepair during the 1970s and was refurbished and re- opened in 1988. The church hall is a recent addition to the church and was built in 2003. To the front of the church is the war memorial with the names of local people who lost their life during two world wars, whose names are read out during each Remembrance Sunday service.

The magazine was founded in 1997 by Sarah Coley, Jane Davis, and Angela Macmillan with a grant from the University of Liverpool's School of English. It operated as part of the University of Liverpool until 2008 when the parent organisation became an independent charitable body. The Reader magazine is currently edited by Philip Davis, author, biographer, and Professor of English at the University of Liverpool. The Deputy Editor is Sarah Coley. The magazine features original poetry and short fiction, essays, interviews and recommendations with an emphasis on the enjoyment of reading good quality writing. Issues are based loosely around a given theme, with letters, a crossword and the famously tricky 'Buck's Quiz' making up the last section. Since taking over the editorship from his wife in 2007 Philip Davis has overseen a successful redesign and relaunch and the magazine now includes a small amount of photography. The magazine has managed to attract many high- profile contributors over the years, including A. S. Byatt, Howard Jacobson, Seamus Heaney, Will Self, Graham Swift, John Kinsella, Les Murray, John Carey, Bel Mooney and Jonathan Bate. As well as the magazine, The Reader Organisation promotes live literature and outreach events and educational community-based projects such as Get Into Reading, promoting and researching the therapeutic value of reading ('bibliotherapy'). In this context The Reader supports and works with other U.K. arts in health charities such as Poems in the Waiting Room.

It was founded on 4 December 1964 by the Federal Republic of Germany as an independent foundation under civil law. It is based in Berlin. Beyond its subscriber base and media coverage, content from Stiftung Warentest can be disseminated through word of mouth.  Aims and importance  Stiftung Warentest has an important role in two main areas. On the one hand it has the task of comparing objective aspects such as usefulness, functionality and environmental impact, and on the other hand it has the mission of educating consumers so they can learn how to make best use of the income available to them and behave in a health promoting and environmentally aware way. Due to its very well known and established reputation as an independent and reliable organization, the foundation has a considerable influence on the buying behavior of consumers. Good ratings and verdicts are often given great prominence in product advertising and on product packaging. In contrast, bad ratings and verdicts frequently lead to a decline in sales and thus sometimes legal action against SW by the manufacturers. According to SW, they are sued ten times a year. The foundation has never actually been ordered by the courts to pay compensation and usually wins any legal action taken against it.  Financing  Stiftung Warentest is self-financing, selling its own magazines test (annual circulation on average 462,000 copies) and Finanztest (234,000), books and special magazine issues, and also investigation results as paid-for content on its own website. Sales revenues in 2012 totalled approximately ‚Ç¨39.5 million. The foundation also receives a subsidy of ‚Ç¨3.5 million from the Federal Ministry of Nutrition, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. This is compensation for the fact that it does not carry any advertisements in its publications because this could compromise its independence.  Investigation work  Stiftung Warentest carries out more than 200 comparative product tests and investigations of services from nearly all areas of everyday life every year. Since 2002, products and services on special limited offer, mainly by the discount retailer chains, have also been investigated every week and the results quickly published. Aspects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have been a part of the investigations of some specified products since 2004. There is also a section on investigated medication (\\"Medikamente im Test\\"), which provides information about more than 9000 medicines and 175 areas of application. Market researchers and scientific staff are employed by Stiftung Warentest with the responsibility for selecting the products and services and the carrying out of the investigations. Each investigation project must be approved of by the Advisory Council and discussed at a meeting with advisory experts representing consumers, industry, manufacturers / retailers and providers, as well as independent experts. The investigations are not actually carried out by Stiftung Warentest's staff members themselves, but by independent external test institutes worldwide. Test samples are purchased anonymously in shops and not provided by the manufacturers. After the tests and the evaluations have been completed, but before publication, details of the objective results are sent to the respective manufacturers and providers for verification and so that they can make their comments. Journalists then summarise the investigation results in a form which makes them easier to read and understand. Staff members who are specifically responsible for verification make sure the published reports and investigation results concur. Up until December 2011, Stiftung Warentest had already published information about 5,300 investigations covering about 100,000 products and 2,137 services.  Investigation results on the website  Stiftung Warentest's website has all the investigation results starting in 2000, as well as current news, special online articles, an interactive calculator and free short versions of between eight and ten investigations per month. Downloading information costs between 75 cents and ‚Ç¨2.50 for detailed investigation results, and a maximum of ‚Ç¨5 for comprehensive product databases.  Verdicts  The classification of the evaluation results is based on the marking system used in German schools. This results in the following categories for the overall verdicts on the quality of goods and services: * 0.5‚Äì1.5: \\"very good\\" * 1.6‚Äì2.5: \\"good\\" * 2.6‚Äì3.5: \\"satisfactory\\" * 3.6‚Äì4.5: \\"adequate\\" * 4.6‚Äì5.5: \\"unsatisfactory\\"  Organisation  Building and seat of Stiftung Warentest in Berlin In accordance with its statutes, Stiftung Warentest has its premises in Berlin, and there are three bodies which are responsible for different areas. The Executive Board conducts the foundation's business and represents it in and out of court. It comprises just one person at the present time, namely Hubertus Primus, the successor of Werner Brinkmann and Roland H√ºttenrauch. The Supervisory Board, which has seven members, is responsible for appointing the Executive Board and also supervising its activities. The Advisory Council, with 18 members, advises the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on all issues of fundamental importance. Editor-in-chief of test is Anita Stocker, until summer 2014 editor-in-chief of Finanztest was Hermann-Josef Tenhagen and editor-in-chief of test.de is Andreas Gebauer. Lucia A. Reisch is and Gerhard Scherhorn has been member of the board of directors. Prominent cases *In April 2004, a facial cream marketed by German actress Uschi Glas received a devastating rating, because the cream caused pimples and rash for people with sensitive skin, and the producer sued the foundation. In April 2005 the suit was turned down by the Landgericht Berlin court. *In January 2006, the foundation criticized the safety of several stadiums to be used in the 2006 World Cup. *In July 2014, Britax R√∂mer criticized Stiftung Warentest over its 4.5 rating for the Britax R√∂mer DUALFIX. Britax R√∂mer argue that their overall low mark was obtained because of an ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù score in the belt routing, determined through a visual observation, which affected the score for the seat construction.  Cooperation with other institutions  Joint international investigations are generally carried out with members of the umbrella organisation International Consumer Research & Testing (ICRT), which is based in London. Thereby Stiftung Warentest is often responsible for the project supervision. In addition to Stiftung Warentest, the most important partner organisations are: * Consumentenbond, The Hague, the Netherlands * Consumers Union, Yonkers, NY, USA * Test Achats / Euroconsumers, Brussels, Belgium * Union F√©d√©rale des Consommateurs, Paris, France * Which?, London, Great Britain.

The school opened in 1969 when the original high school (now called Toms River High School South) was found to be too small to accommodate the fast-growing community. However, the first class to graduate wasn't until 1971, since all of the seniors were kept at TRHSS for the class of 1970. Toms River High School North is the largest of all schools in the Toms River Regional School district. The TRHSN mascot is the Mariner, and the school colors are navy blue and gold.

(formerly Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V. or in short Signaal) is a subsidiary of the French multinational company Thales Group based in the Netherlands. The firm was founded as NV Hazemeyer's Fabriek van Signaalapparaten during 1922 by Hazemeyer and Siemens & Halske to produce naval fire-control systems. During the Second World War, the company's factory was captured and pillaged by the German Army; shortly after the conflict's end, the remaining assets were nationalised by the Dutch government, the company being renamed N.V. Hollandsche Signaalapparaten (or Signaal for short). During 1956, the Netherlands-based electronics company Philips became the majority owner of Signaal after buying a large portion of the shares from the government. The firm expanded throughout much the Cold War period, producing various naval electronics and defense systems for a range of customers around the world. During 1990, the French electronics and defence contractor Thomson-CSF acquired Signall from Philips; accordingly, Signaal was rebranded as Thomson-CSF Signaal. Following the renaming of Thomson-CSF to Thales in 2000, Thomson-CSF Signaal was renamed Thales Nederland. Presently, the company is primarily involved in naval defence systems, such as sensors, radars and infrared systems. Other areas of business include air defence, communications, optronics, cryogenic cooling systems and navigation products. History Building of Thales Nederland in Hengelo The company was founded during 1922 in the city of the Hengelo, in the Netherlands as NV Hazemeyer's Fabriek van Signaalapparaten by Hazemeyer and Siemens & Halske. Initially specialising in the development of naval fire-control systems, the company was established in the Netherlands was a means of getting around the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles on Germany; there was a specific stipulation forbidding any German company from manufacturing military equipment. The first major contract to be secured by the company was for the production of the fire control systems of the HNLMS Sumatra and HNLMS Java, two of the Royal Netherlands Navy's Java-class light cruisers. Throughout the interwar period, the firm expanded rapidly, gaining customers in overseas nations such as Sweden, Spain and Greece. During May 1940, amid the turbulent world events of the Second World War, the company's factory was captured virtually intact by the German Army, having invaded the country during the Battle of the Netherlands. A high proportion of the firm's employee were able to escape to the United Kingdom, where many applied their expertise with radar and fire control systems on behalf of the Allies. Following the Liberation of the Netherlands and the end of the conflict, most chose to return to the country; the factory itself having been pillaged and left derelict by the Germans. In the immediate postwar years, the Dutch government, being aware of the company's value as a part of its wider defence industry, decided to intervene, nationalising the company along with its remaining asserts, after which it operated under the name N.V. Hollandsche Signaalapparaten (or Signaal for short). During the late 1940s, replacement buildings and facilities were erected and new staff was recruited. In this period of reestablishment, several valuable technologies and new systems were developed in fields such as radar, fire control systems, computers and air traffic control apparatus. During 1956, a large portion of shares in the company were purchased from the Dutch government by the Netherlands-based electronics company Philips, making it the majority owner of Signaal. Over the following decades, the business developed various new product lines. During 1975, Signaal began development of what would become the Goalkeeper CIWS, an autonomous short-range defensive weapon system; it would develop and produce the Goalkeeper for over five decades. In the latter part of the 1980s, another defense subsidiary of Philips, named Usfa, was partially merged with Signaal, becoming known as Signaal USFA. Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, the firm continued to expand, opening up multiple factories across the Netherlands. By the end of the Cold War, Signaal had expanded to the point where it had customers in 35 countries and in excess of 5,000 employees. However, the Cold War's demise had led to hefty cuts in many nation's defence budgets, which had in turn caused a downturn in customer demand for Signaal, compelling the company to reorganise itself and to reduce its level of staffing. During 1990, Philips decided that it no longer wanted to pursue defence as a core activity of its portfolio; thus Signaal was sold on to the French electronics and defence contractor Thomson-CSF. Accordingly, Signaal was rebranded as Thomson- CSF Signaal. Following the acquisition, various new systems, largely focused upon defence equipment and combat management tools, were developed. It has continued to specialise in the production of integrated naval command and control, sensor, and communications systems, along with ground-based air defense systems, telecommunications equipment, and training services to customers across the world. Shortly following the renaming of Thomson-CSF to Thales during 2000, Thomson-CSF Signaal was renamed Thales Nederland. Since then, the company has continued to expand and seek new opportunities for business.

Bass played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) as a cornerback for the Washington Redskins from 1969 to 1975. He appeared in 104 consecutive games for the Redskins between 1969 and 1975, recorded 30 interceptions, and scored the Redskins' only touchdown in Super Bowl VII on a 49-yard fumble return. In 2002, Bass was selected as one of the 70 greatest Redskins players of all time. A native of Ypsilanti, Michigan, Bass played college football as a halfback for the University of Michigan from 1964 to 1966. He also appeared in two games as a special teams player for the Detroit Lions in 1967. Early years Bass was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1945. His father, Thomas Bass, was a physician, and his mother, Louise Bass, was a teacher. Bass attended Ypsilanti High School, where he participated in football, basketball, and track and field. University of Michigan Bass received a scholarship to the University of Michigan, enrolling in 1963, and playing on the Michigan Wolverines football team as a halfback from 1964 to 1966. As a junior, Bass started one game at quarterback and two games at right halfback for the 1965 Michigan Wolverines football team. As a senior, he started two games at left halfback and four games at right halfback for the 1966 Michigan team. Although listed as a halfback, Bass played principally on defense and was limited to five carries on offense for 13 rushing yards. He graduated from Michigan in 1967 with a bachelor of arts degree in education. Professional football Bass was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 12th round (314th overall pick) of the 1967 NFL Draft. Before the start of the 1967 NFL season, the Packers sold Bass to the Detroit Lions. Bass spent most of the 1967 season on the Lions' taxi squad, but was activated late in the season and appeared in the last two games on special teams. He spent the 1968 NFL season on the Lions' taxi squad. During his stint with the Lions, Bass had a small speaking part in the 1968 film Paper Lion. In February 1969, Bass signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins. He spent the next seven seasons from as a cornerback with the Redskins, appearing in 104 consecutive games for the Redskins between 1969 and 1975. In seven seasons with the Redskins, Bass recorded 30 interceptions for 478 return yards and three touchdowns. He also recovered six fumbles and gained 105 yards on eight kickoff returns. He gave up only eight touchdown passes in his NFL career. In 1972, the Redskins defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1972 NFC Championship Game. The Redskins held the Cowboys to three points and limited Roger Staubach to 9 of 20 passing for 98 yards. The Redskins' cornerbacks, Bass and Pat Fischer, were credited with shutting down the Cowboys' wide receivers. The Redskins advanced to Super Bowl VII, where they lost to the Miami Dolphins, 14-7. Bass scored the only touchdown for the Redskins in Super Bowl VII, when he picked up Garo Yepremian's botched pass, following a blocked field goal, and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown. In 1974, Bass was selected as a first-team All-NFC player by the Associated Press, United Press International, and Sporting News. In July 1976, Bass announced his retirement from football due to a neck injury the prior year that was re-injured during the 1976 pre-season. X-rays showed a change in the vertebra, and Bass said at the time he \\"didn't feel it necessary to take a chance.\\" In 2002, Bass was named one of the 70 greatest Redskins players of all time. Later years After retiring from the NFL, Bass moved to the Freeport, Bahamas, where he was the owner and operator of Channel House Resort Club for 18 years.

Early years  Birth house of Parnakh in Taganrog. Parnakh was born into a Jewish family in the Azov Sea port of Taganrog on July 26, 1891. His twin sister was the children's author Yelizaveta Tarakhovskaya and an older sister the poet Sophia Parnok. His family name was Parnokh but he later changed it to the more Sephardic‚Äìsounding Parnakh (his sister Sophia also later changed her name, but to the less Jewish-sounding Parnok). Parnakh's mother, a doctor, died when he was very young, and his father, a pharmacist, remarried soon after. In 1913, Parnakh traveled to Italy and the Middle East, staying for a while in Palestine and returning to Saint Petersburg the same year. In Saint Petersburg, he entered the University, where he studied Romance languages, music (under the direction of Mikhail Gnesin) and theater (under direction of Vsevolod Meyerhold). In 1916, while World War I was raging, he moved to Paris, where he stayed for six years. He studied at Sorbonne University and was elected President of the Paris Chamber of Poets, and became fascinated by the jazz music he discovered in Paris. Jazz in the USSR In 1922, feeling alienated from most of the political emigrants from Russia, Parnakh returned to Russia, bringing jazz scores, saxophones, tam-tam's, and trumpet sordinos, and he soon founded the \\"First Eccentric Orchestra of the Russian Federated Socialist Republic - Valentin Parnakh's Jazz Band\\", which held its debut concert at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts in Moscow on October 1, 1922. This New Orleans‚Äìstyle jazz band became popular and influential among the artists of the Russian avant-garde of those days. Parnakh was also creative director for music and choreography at Vsevolod Meyerhold's Meyerhold Theater, where his Eccentric Orchestra performed hits of the time, such as Kitten on the Keyboards and the ballet suite The Bull on the Roof. Parnokh greatly influenced Meyerhold's \\"Biomechanics\\" acting method, and his band appeared in the 1924 play Trest D.E. (directed by Meyerhold and based on Ilya Ehrenburg's 1923 novel Trust D.E.). On May 1, 1923, Parnokh's band performed before members the Comintern participating in the Agricultural Expo. The Soviet press of the time wrote: \\"For the first time jazz music was performed at an official state function, something which has never happened in the West\\". Parnokh also published numerous articles on the contemporary music culture of the West and was the first to promote the work of Charlie Chaplin and the first to introduce French Dadaist poetry into the Soviet Union. In 1925, he published a book of poems, Introduction To Dance (which included a portrait of Parnokh by Picasso). Paris and return to Russia However, by 1925 Parnokh had become disillusioned with life in the Soviet Union, where publishing houses were refusing to publish his poetry and his translations of the French poet G√©rard de Nerval. In October 1925 Parnokh returned to Paris, where he published many articles on theater and dance in Russian immigrant newspapers and in the French press and translated Spanish literature. The main character of Osip Mandelshtam's 1928 novella Egyptian Stamp is named \\"Parnok\\" and was perceived by Parnakh as a derogatory caricature. Parnokh returned to the Soviet Union at the end of 1931 and served as a translator at the Foreign Board of the Writers Union. He continued his translations of Spanish writers such as Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. In 1934 Parnokh published a Russian translation of a collection of Spanish and Portuguese poets (mostly Marrano Jews) who had been executed by the Inquisition (Parnakh had previously translated the poems into French as well, but the manuscript of this translation had been lost). Later years During World War II, Parnakh, like many other members of the Writers Union, were evacuated to Chistopol and had absolutely no means of support. Desperately seeking work, he applied together with the poet Marina Tsvetaeva (a long-ago lover of his sister Sophia) to the Soviet Literature Fund asking for a job at the LitFund's canteen. He was hired as a doorman, while Tsvetaeva's application for a dishwasher's position was turned down and she committed suicide six days later. Parnakh's only work to be published after the war was his translation of memoirs by Th√©odore‚ÄìAgrippa d'Aubign√© in 1949, with his own foreword rejected by the publishing house. Parnakh outlived Tsvetaeva by a decade and died in his Moscow apartment on January 29, 1951. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. His twin sister, who died in 1968, is buried near him. Filmography * ¬´The Adventures of Oktyabrina¬ª. Moscow, 1924. Dir. G. Kozintsev, L.

Plot Having massacred an Indian village with his gang, scalp hunter Duncan rides to the nearest town to discover that he is now an outlaw, as scalp hunting is now illegal. Duncan murders the sheriff and begins burning the town. In the town, Duncan meets Lynne, the town doctor, who conspires with Duncan to steal a train full of the bank's money. Three female entertainers and their manager overhear talk of the plot and ride to the next town of Esperanza to warn people. Several of Duncan's gang attempt to kill them, but their scheme is thwarted by Navajo Joe. Joe steals the train back from Duncan's gang. He asks the townspeople of Esperanza to pay him to protect them from Duncan, demanding, \\"I want a dollar a head from every man in this town for every bandit I kill.\\" The townspeople reject him, as they \\"don't make bargains with Indians.\\" Lynne's wife Hannah persuades them otherwise. Joe sets a trap for Duncan, but is caught and tortured, and Lynne and Hannah are killed. Rescued by an old man who leads the female entertainers, Joe again steals the train and wipes out Duncan's gang. A showdown occurs in an Indian cemetery, where Joe reclaims the pendant that Duncan had stolen from his wife when he murdered her. As Joe turns, Duncan shoots him with a hidden gun. Injured, Joe grabs a tomahawk and throws it, hitting Duncan square in the forehead. With Duncan dead, Joe sends his horse back to town, carrying the bank's money. The townspeople are surprised that Joe has kept his word and are relieved that there money has been returned. Estella, disappointed in the attitudes of the townspeople and grateful for what Joe has done for them, sends Joe's horse back to be reunited with him, leaving his fate ambiguous after his fight with Duncan.

Corbucci claimed that Marlon Brando was promised to him for the lead role in the film. De Laurentiis cast Reynolds for the role because he felt that Reynolds resembled Brando. Reynolds was a friend of Clint Eastwood, who had raved to Reynolds about a director named Sergio. Eastwood introduced Reynolds to De Laurentiis, who was looking for an actor who could do his own stunts. Reynolds went to Italy in April 1966. He later spoke about his time in Europe, explaining that \\"... the only thing today for an American actor is to go to Europe for $350,000, crinkle up the film, jump up and down a couple of times and you've got it made.\\" De Laurentiis announced that the film would be part of a six-picture deal that he had with United Artists, which included films titled Absurd Universe, Matchless, A River of Dollars (with Reynolds and Henry Silva, later filmed as The Hills Run Red with Thomas Hunter replacing Reynolds), The Bandit (with Clint Eastwood) and Waterloo. De Laurentiis received many script re-writes from Piero Regnoli and Fernando di Leo; after the sixth draft, he approved the script. Reynolds was surprised that the cast was predominantly non-English- speaking and that the director was not Sergio Leone as he had thought, but Sergio Corbucci. Reynolds would later state that the film had failed because he had worked with \\"the wrong Sergio.\\"p. 86 Wong, Aliza S. Spaghetti Westerns: A Viewer's Guide Rowman & Littlefield, 15 Dec 2018 Reynolds has stated that the Italian crew did not know what \\"real Indians\\" looked like, describing his wig that made him look like Natalie Wood. Reynolds added, \\"... of course when you play a half-breed you have to be stoic - and you can't get funky - and you have to have a deep voice. Apparently there are no Indians with high voices. And you have to shave your arms all the time. It's easy to get the left but just try and reach the right.\\" Commenting on his role in the film, Reynolds felt that the physical aspects did not worry him, but that his costumes did. Of his work, Corbucci declared that he made \\"... European Westerns the way they like them over here. Plenty of action. Little talk. And I have the privilege of changing at a moment's notice the costumes and geography.\\" Release Navajo Joe was released in Italy in November 1966 and in the United States in 1967. Reception In a contemporary review, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times dismissed the film as \\"colorless\\" and another of the \\"... super-bloody 'Westerns' made by Italians and Spaniards in Spain with Italian, Spanish and American actors.\\" Variety noted that Regnoli and Di Leo's screenplay allowed for \\"... fast movement which Corbucci handles well enough\\", ultimately declaring the film to be \\"Lowercase western ... Okay for minor action market.\\" In a retrospective review, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D rating, calling it \\"a dubbed Italian botch,\\" finding it inferior to another Western that he reviewed, Man of the West. Burt Reynolds described Navajo Joe as \\"So awful it was only shown in prisons and airplanes because nobody could leave. I killed ten thousand guys, wore a Japanese slingshot and a fright wig.\\" When Reynolds won an Emmy in 1991 for Evening Shade, he said during his acceptance speech, \\"All those pictures ‚Äì Navajo Joe ‚Äì they paid off, you know.\\"  References =FootnotesSources * * External links Navajo Joe at the Spaghetti Western Database * Category:1966 films Category:Italian films Category:Films directed by Sergio Corbucci Category:Spaghetti Western films Category:1966 Western (genre) films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish Western (genre) films Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films about Native Americans Category:Italian films about revenge Category:Films shot in Almer√≠a ","title":"Navajo Joe"},{"id":"3762627","text":"\\"A Painful Case\\" is a short story by Irish author James Joyce, published in his 1914 collection Dubliners. The story Mr. Duffy, a middle-aged bank cashier, deliberately lives in an isolated suburb of Dublin. He is characterized as very meticulous and ordered and has little social contact. At a concert one night, Duffy makes the acquaintance of Mrs. Emily Sinico, a married mother. They start up a relationship that is innocent enough to be condoned by Mrs. Sinico‚Äôs husband, who believes the two's discussions revolve mostly around his daughter and the possibility of a relationship between her and Duffy. The two draw closer together, and one night Mrs. Sinico impulsively takes his hand and presses it to her cheek, but Duffy is not pleased at the development and ends their meetings. Four years later, he reads that Mrs. Sinico has been struck by a train and killed. The newspaper article, the title of which provides the title of the story, contains an account by her husband, who states that she began drinking two years ago. The details of the accident suggest that she may have caused her own death. He reacts at first with revulsion, concluding that some inherent weakness led to her drinking and the accident, but he slowly comes to believe that it was his rejection that condemned her to solitude and death. He reflects on his own loneliness: \\"No one wanted him; he was outcast from life's feast.\\" The story ends with Duffy listening to the silence of the surrounding night atop a hill overlooking Dublin where he and Sinico used to sit down and talk, where he realizes just how lonely he really is.

Ice pellets are smaller than hailstones which form in thunderstorms rather than in winter, and are different from graupel (\\"soft hail\\") which is made of frosty white rime, and from a mixture of rain and snow which is a slushy liquid or semisolid. Ice pellets often bounce when they hit the ground or other solid objects, and make a higher-pitched \\"tap\\" when striking objects like jackets, windshields, and dried leaves, compared to the dull splat of liquid raindrops. Pellets generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain. The METAR code for ice pellets is PL (PE before November 1998).  Terminology  Ice pellets are known as sleet in the United States, the official term used by the U.S. National Weather Service. However, the term sleet refers to a mixture of rain and snow in most Commonwealth countries, including Canada. Because of this, Environment Canada never uses the term sleet, and uses the terms \\"ice pellets\\" or \\"wet snow\\" instead.Chris St. Clair, Canada's Weather, p. 55, Firefly Books, 2009.  Formation  Temperature profile for ice pellet formation. Ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air is located between above the ground, with sub-freezing air both above and below it. This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer (the French term for sleet, neige fondue, literally means \\"melted snow\\" because of this). As they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets. However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze before hitting the surface, so it will become freezing rain. A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season,Weatherquestions.com. What causes ice pellets (sleet)? Retrieved on 2007-12-08. but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front, and often with a stationary front. An accumulation of ice pellets U.S. penny for scale  Effects  In most parts of the world, ice pellets only occur for brief periods and do not accumulate a significant amount. However, across the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, warm air flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico ahead of a strong synoptic-scale storm system can overrun cold, dense air at the surface for many hundreds of miles for an extended period of time. In these areas, ice pellet accumulations of are not unheard of. The effects of a significant accumulation of ice pellets are not unlike an accumulation of snow. One significant difference is that for the same volume of snow, an equal volume of ice pellets is significantly heavier and thus more difficult to clear away. Additionally, a volume of ice pellets takes significantly longer to melt compared to an equal volume of fresh snowfall.

The treatment, during which Candace was suffocated, included a rebirthing script. History Candace was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina, to Angela and Todd Elmore. At a young age, she and her younger brother Michael and sister Chelsea were removed from the home for neglect and separated by social services. When she was five, her parents' parental rights were terminated. Two years later she was adopted by Jeane Elizabeth Newmaker, a single woman and pediatric nurse practitioner in Durham, North Carolina. Within months of the adoption, Jeane began taking Candace to a psychiatrist, complaining about her behavior and attitude at home. Though Candace was treated with medications, Jeane reported that Candace's behavior got worse during the ensuing two years, a period supposedly including her playing with matches and also killing goldfishes. Attachment therapy and Candace's death Candace and Jeane Newmaker traveled to Evergreen, Colorado, in April 2000, for a $7,000 two-week \\"intensive\\" session of attachment therapy with Connell Watkins (who was without license) upon a referral from William Goble, a licensed psychologist in North Carolina. Candace died during the second week of the intensive sessions with Watkins during what has been called a \\"rebirthing\\" session. Participating in the fatal session as therapists were Watkins and Julie Ponder, also without a license, along with Candace's \\"therapeutic foster parents,\\" Brita St. Clair, Jack McDaniel, and Jeane Newmaker. Following the script for that day's treatment, Candace was wrapped in a flannel sheet and covered with pillows to simulate a womb or birth canal and was told to fight her way out of it, with the apparent expectation that the experience would help her \\"attach\\" to her adoptive mother. Four of the adults (weighing a combined total of 673 pounds) used their hands and feet to push on Candace's head, chest, and 70-pound body to resist her attempts to free herself, while she complained, pleaded, and even screamed for help and air, unable to escape from the sheet. Candace stated eleven times during the session that she was dying, to which Ponder responded, \\"Go ahead. Die right now, for real. For real.\\" Twenty minutes into the session, Candace had vomited and excreted inside of the sheet; she was nonetheless kept restrained within. Forty minutes into the session, Candace was asked if she wanted to be reborn. She faintly responded \\"no\\"; this would ultimately be her last word. To this, Ponder replied, \\"Quitter, quitter, quitter, quitter! Quit, quit, quit, quit. She's a quitter!\\" Jeane Newmaker, who said later she felt rejected by Candace's inability to be reborn, was asked by Watkins to leave the room, in order for Candace not to \\"pick up on (Jeane's) sorrow.\\" Soon thereafter, Watkins requested the same of McDaniel and Brita St. Clair, leaving only herself and Ponder in the room with Candace. After talking for five minutes, the two unwrapped Candace and found that she was motionless, blue on the fingertips and lips, and not breathing. Upon seeing this, Watkins declared, \\"Oh there she is; she's sleeping in her vomit,\\" whereupon Newmaker, who had been watching on a monitor in another room, rushed into the room, remarked on Candace's color, and began CPR while Watkins called 9-1-1. When paramedics arrived ten minutes later, McDaniel told them that Candace had been left alone for five minutes during a rebirthing session and was not breathing. The paramedics surmised that Candace had been unconscious and possibly not breathing for some time. Paramedics were able to restore the girl's pulse and she was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Denver; however, she was declared brain-dead the next day as a consequence of asphyxia. The entire fatal session, as well as ten hours of other sessions from the preceding days, had been videotaped as a matter of course with Watkins's treatment. All the videos were shown at the trial of Watkins and Ponder. Convictions A year later, Watkins and Ponder were tried and convicted of reckless child abuse resulting in death and received 16-year prison sentences. Brita St. Clair and Jack McDaniel, the therapeutic foster parents, pleaded guilty to criminally negligent child abuse and were given ten years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service in a plea bargain. The adoptive mother, Jeane Newmaker, a nurse practitioner, pleaded guilty to neglect and abuse charges and was given a four-year suspended sentence, after which the charges were expunged from her record. An appeal by Watkins against conviction and sentence failed. Watkins was paroled in June 2008, under \\"intense supervision\\" with restrictions on contact with children or counseling work, having served approximately seven years of her 16-year sentence. Effects The story of Candace's death was a national one in the United States of America. Contemporaneous reports about her death and the subsequent trial of her therapists appeared in newspapers and news magazines all across the country, and internationally.

It has a surface area of , and it is located primarily in Washington County on the Albemarle- Pamlico Peninsula between the Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico Sound. The easternmost part of the lake extends into Tyrrell County. An Indian dugout canoe was found in the lake dating back nearly 4,400 years. Other artifacts have been found around the area dating as early as 8,000 B.C. Its origin has long puzzled scientists. Some say that its origin is underground springs, wave action, wind, a meteor, glacial activity or a peat burn. It is more or less a round shape. Lake Phelps is named for Josiah Phelps, the first white man to enter its waters. Phelps and another colonial explorer, Benjamin Tarkington, were searching through what was then known as the Great Eastern Dismal or Great Alligator Dismal in 1755. Phelps and Tarkington were part of a group of hunters who entered the swamps in search of game and farmland. The group had become discouraged and were about to leave when Tarkington scaled one of the many trees and spotted the lake a short distance away. Phelps went ahead and ran into the water. As the first in the water he was given the honor of naming the lake. The lake was established as a North Carolina State Lake in 1929, and it is managed by the adjacent Pettigrew State Park.

History Originally named Johnstown after an early landowner, the post office was renamed Holland East in 1851. It was renamed again to its present name in 1857. The name comes from Chatsworth House, in Derbyshire, near the home town of the postmaster at that time. Chatsworth was founded in 1848 at the northern terminus of the Toronto-Sydenham Colonization Road. Modern Highway 10 follows most of the original road's route. On January 1, 2001, The Village of Chatsworth was merged into the new Township of Chatsworth, along with Holland and Sullivan Townships. Famous Canadian suffragette Nellie McClung was born in Chatsworth. Transportation Chatsworth sits at the junction of Ontario Highway 6 and Ontario Highway 10, which are the modern-day evolutions of the Garafraxa Colonization Road and the Toronto-Sydenham Colonization Road respectively. The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway once passed through the village, but that section of its line (then owned by Canadian Pacific) was abandoned in the 1980s. It is served by Kasper Transportation's Owen Sound to Guelph intercity bus route, which began operating in January 2020 with a fourteen-seat passenger van.

The trail runs on the abandoned right-of-way of the Western Maryland Railway's West Subdivision. The line was officially abandoned in 1975 and the final train on the line, a work train that removed the rails between Big Pool and Tonoloway, was run in December 1988. The portion through the C&O; Canal National Park reverted to the Park Service in 1980. In August 1990, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources purchased the right-of-way from 1/2 mile west of Fort Frederick State Park to Little Orleans through Hancock from CSX Transportation. Construction began on the first ten-mile (16 km) section from Fort Frederick to Hancock in 1997 and was completed in 1998. The second section, running from Hancock to Pollypon, a small body of water where canal boats would winter, began in 2001 and opened on June 10, 2002. Construction began on the third section, a extension from Pollypon to Pearre Station in 2003 and it opened in 2005. The trail was originally intended to continue along National Park Service land all the way to a point just across the river from Paw Paw, WV, but due to environmental concerns and the risk to bat habitat it is now to end at Little Orleans, MD. The extension to Little Orleans was originally funded in 2005, when the trail was still intended to go to Paw Paw. After a 2008 study found bats living in the tunnels, an environmental assessment was undertaken to determine the feasibility of using the tunnels for the trail. The environmental impact study determined that the Indigo tunnel houses the largest known bat refuge in Maryland. The tunnel is one of the largest hibernaculum of five species of bats, including the Eastern Small-footed bat and the Indiana bat (both currently listed as endangered) as well as numerous other bats. In 2010, following a survey done in March of that year, Maryland state officials and the National Park Service agreed that the trail would bypass the Indigo Tunnel to protect the bat population. Instead the extension will use the C&O; Canal towpath to bypass the tunnel within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. In 2012, the National Park Service completed the Environmental Assessment for the extension of the Western Maryland Rail Trail between Pearre and Paw Paw. It included several alternatives that would extend the trail between 8.1 and 14.4 miles, including options to either run the trail through, or build bypasses around Stickpile and Kessler Tunnels. The Park Service selected the alternative that would do neither, and instead chose to extend the trail 7.2 miles to the entrance to Stickpile Tunnel where it would terminate, and then add an additional 0.9 mile section on the west side from the bridge over the C&O; Canal near Paw Paw to the 5th Potomac River Crossing on the north side of Bevan Bend. Bypassing the Stickpile Tunnel was possible, but the topography around Kessler was found to be too challenging. As a result, the extension through the Paw Paw Bends west of Little Orleans was placed on indefinite hold in 2014. By 2016, West Virginia had dropped out of the plan, and so the sections from Little Orleans to Stickpile tunnel and the western 0.9 mile section were dropped. Phase IV to Little Orleans has been frequently delayed with start dates delayed from 2012, 2014 and 2016. The project finally went out to bid in May 2017. References The new section was competed, opened, and dedicated in May, 2019.

Todd, like former Jets quarterback Joe Namath and Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, played for the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide under coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant. College In high school, Todd attended Davidson High School in Mobile, Alabama. Individually, Todd owned the state shot-put record at the time. He then went on to play for Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama, where he was a three-year starter at quarterback. During his time at Alabama, the Crimson Tide ran the wishbone offense. In his sophomore year, Todd shared the quarterback position with Gary Rutledge. In a game against Virginia Tech, which the Tide won 77-6, Todd was one of four backs who ran for over 100 yards. The 1973 season concluded in the Sugar Bowl, with a 24-23 loss to Notre Dame. In that game, Todd caught a 25-yard touchdown pass. In 1974, injuries plagued Todd. The Tide went on to have a rematch with Notre Dame, this time in the Orange Bowl. Todd threw for Alabama's only touchdown in the fourth quarter and helped convert two points, but the Tide lost 13-11. In the Sugar Bowl at the end of the 1975 season, his college career ended in New Orleans against Penn State. Todd threw for over 200 yards, and led Alabama to its first bowl victory in eight years. Alabama never lost an SEC game while Richard Todd was the starting quarterback. *1973: 18/33 for 325 yards with 4 TD vs 2 INT. 560 yards and 2 TD rushing. *1974: 36/67 for 656 yards with 5 TD vs 2 INT. 265 yards and 5 TD rushing. *1975: 47/89 for 661 yards with 7 TD vs 3 INT. 429 yards and 9 TD rushing. He would end his college career as a very efficient QB, throwing 16 TD against just 7 INT in 189 PA while running for 1,254 yards and 16 TD. Professional career The New York Jets drafted Todd in the first round of the 1976 Draft. Todd would be the last Alabama quarterback taken in the first round until Tua Tagovailoa, who was selected by the Miami Dolphins as the fifth overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. The intention was for Todd to replace another Alabama legend, Joe Namath. Todd stated that playing on the same team with Namath was \\"a dream come true.\\" After the 1976 season, Namath was released and Todd, who was 23 years old, was named the starter. In his first five seasons, he threw more interceptions than touchdowns and was booed by fans and criticized by the press. He is also known for an incident in which he shoved reporter Steve Serby into a locker after Serby supported backup quarterback Matt Robinson as starter, instead of him. In a 1980 game against the San Francisco 49ers, in which the Jets had fallen far behind early, Todd, throwing under a prevent zone defense, set a then-NFL record with 42 completions. (The record would stand until Drew Bledsoe completed 45 passes in a single game during the 1994 season.) The Niners won the game, 37-27. Todd threw 30 interceptions in 1980, and the Jets finished 4-12. Late in the 1980 season, Todd's Jets hosted the winless New Orleans Saints; Todd completed only 10 of 27 passes and was intercepted twice, as the Saints grabbed a 21-20 win for their only win of the 1980 season. Also that year, Todd set an NFL record for throwing an interception in 15 games in one season. In 1981, Todd led the Walt Michaels-coached Jets to their first winning record (10-5-1) since 1969, thanks in part to a defense nicknamed the \\"New York Sack Exchange.\\" In the AFC Wild Card Playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, he led a comeback after the team had fallen behind, 24-0, but fell short, as a late pass was intercepted near the Bills' goal line. The following year, he led the Jets back to the playoffs. New York defeated the defending AFC Champion Cincinnati Bengals, 44-17, then beat the Los Angeles Raiders, 17-14, before facing the Dolphins in Miami in the AFC Championship Game. The game was played in the mud after the Dolphins failed to cover the field during a pre-game rainstorm. Todd threw five interceptions in the game and the Jets lost, 14-0. His final year with New York saw a change at head coach, as Walt Michaels was replaced with Jets offensive coordinator Joe Walton. The Jets finished the season at 7-9 and Todd was traded to the New Orleans Saints after the season. Todd played only two seasons in New Orleans, as he replaced another aging, interception-prone (and former Super Bowl winning) Alabama legend at quarterback, Kenny Stabler. His first year with the Saints was the worst year of his career, as he threw 19 interceptions and just 11 touchdown passes. In 1985, the Saints went 5-11, a troubling season that included changes in coaching and ownership, and saw Todd losing playing time to Louisiana native Bobby Hebert, who had come to the Saints from the USFL, where he had won a championship with the Michigan Panthers. Todd briefly returned to the Jets in 1986 after a knee injury to then QB Ken O'Brien, but did not play. According to the New York Times, Todd was released from the Jets on October 29, 1986. Todd finished his career with 1,610 completions in 2,967 attempts for 20,610 yards and 124 touchdowns, with 161 interceptions. He also rushed for 932 yards and 14 touchdowns.

She was born Mary Balfour in 1817, the daughter of James Balfour MP and Lady Eleanor Maitland; they were grandparents of Arthur Balfour 1st Earl Balfour. She grew up in Whittingehame House, East Lothian, Scotland, and travelled widely during her childhood. She took drawing lessons but had no other formal art education. She met Henry Arthur Herbert while abroad in Rome and married him in September, 1837. His family owned the Muckross Estate near Killarney in County Kerry, Ireland, and they moved there to Torc Cottage after their wedding. She loved the Muckross estate as it had always reminded her of her childhood home in Scotland. She brought a large dowry to the marriage, of ¬£40,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The couple were then able to start construction of a large house in 1839, which was finished in 1843, shortly before the Great Famine. The couple had four children, all born abroad between 1839 and 1846. They were Eleanor, Henry Arthur, Charles, and Blanche. Mary put much effort into raising funds for the famine-stricken inhabitants of the estate, but she lived away from the estate, in England. She also worked at developing her talents as a watercolour artist, and she displayed considerable skill with practice. She painted many scenes from the Lakes of Killarney and was recognised as the \\"...most gifted amateur in the kingdom.\\" (The Times, Friday 30 August 1861). Queen Victoria visited the estate with the Royal family in 1861 and received several of Mary's paintings as a parting gift. Henry died in 1866 and was interred in the family vault at Killegy graveyard near Muckross House, and Mary then moved back to England with her two daughters. She was able to rekindle many of her old friendships with people notable in art at the time, including Edward Burne-Jones who was a close friend of the well-known artist William Morris. After her oldest daughter Eleanor's marriage in 1871, Mary moved to Bellagio, Italy, near Lake Como and continued her artwork there. She died in London in 1893 and was buried with her husband in Killegy graveyard. The house has subsequently become a museum, and the estate is now Killarney National Park.

Specifically, pelB refers to pectate lyase B of Erwinia carotovora CE. The leader sequence consists of the 22 N-terminal amino acid residues. This leader sequence can be attached to any other protein (on the DNA level) resulting in a transfer of such a fused protein to the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, often used in genetic engineering. Protein secretion can increase the stability of cloned gene products. For instance it was shown that the half-life of the recombinant proinsulin is increased 10-fold when the protein is secreted to the periplasmic space. (vijji.

It is located in the northern Negev Desert, near Sderot. The ranch covers 3,823 dunams (4 km¬≤). Sharon purchased the ranch in 1972 with the help of a loan from Meshulam Riklis. The ownership of the ranch was turned over to Sharon's sons Omri and Gilad, to avoid conflict of interest when Sharon became Agriculture Minister of Israel and Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel. The farm was built on the lands of a depopulated Arab village, Huj. According to Izzeldin Abuelaish the mosque of this village has been serving as the pen for Sharon's Arabian thoroughbred horses. In 2007, the farm was hit by rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. One rocket exploded near a sheep barn. In June 2010, the Israel Land Administration (ILA) renewed the ranch's lease for an additional 49 years at NIS142,000 per year.

The Raffles' Landing Site is the location where tradition holds that Sir Stamford Raffles landed in on 28 January 1819. The site is located at Boat Quay within the Civic District, in the Downtown Core of the Central Area, Singapore's central business district. History On 28 January 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles landed at this site for his first visit, which lasted ten days. During this period, with the help of Major William Farquhar, he concluded the first treaty with the local rulers Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein Shah.Koh, T. Singapore: The Encyclopedia (2006), p. 204, Didier Millet, . The site is denoted by a statue of Sir Stamford Raffles and is located on the north bank of the Singapore River. The present polymarble statue was unveiled in 1972 which was made from plaster casts from the original 1887 figure that currently stands opposite Victoria Concert Halls. In 2019, as part of events commemorating the bicentennial of the Founding of modern Singapore, numerous alterations have been made to and around the statue of Raffles such as using camouflage to make the statue 'disappear' into the backdrop of the buildings in Raffles Place on the south bank, and erecting statues of Raffles' contemporaries such as Munshi Abdullah, Tan Tock Seng, and Naraina Pillai along with that of the founder of the Kingdom of Singapura, Sang Nila Utama. Additional status was added as part of the commemorating the bicentennial of the Founding of modern Singapore. Plaque inscription The Plaque at the landing site reads \\"On this historic site, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles first landed in Singapore on 28th January 1819, and with genius and perception changed the destiny of Singapore from an obscure fishing village to a great seaport and modern metropolis.\\" Dispute There is a dispute as to where was the exact location that Raffles first landed in Singapore. While the Raffles' Landing Site on the north bank of the Singapore River is generally believed to be the location, there is another source that claims otherwise. Based on the Cho Clan Archives, Raffles ordered his ship's carpenter, Chow Ah Chi, to lead the way in posting the British East India Company flag on mainland Singapore and he supposedly landed at the mouth of the Rochor River in Kallang. Raffles, following the route taken by Chow, also arrived at the Kallang Basin in what is today's Kallang Riverside Park.

A female novice is a ≈õrƒÅma·πáerƒ´ or ≈õrƒÅma·πáerikƒÅ (Sanskrit; PƒÅli: sƒÅma·πáerƒ´).  Etymology  The sƒÅma·πáera is a Pali language diminutive equivalent to the Sanskrit term ≈õrƒÅma·πáera, which indicates an ascetic practitioner. Therefore, sƒÅma·πáera might be said to mean \\"small or young renunciate\\". In some South and Southeast Asian Buddhist traditions, the term refers to someone who has taken the initial pravrajya vows but not the upasampada or full ordination. The pratimok·π£a rules do not apply to them and they do not take part in the recital of the rules on uposatha days. The Sanskrit word ≈õrƒÅma·πáerikƒÅ is the feminine form of ≈õrƒÅma·πáera.  History  The account provided in the literature of South Asian Buddhism (and adopted by other Buddhist sects) is that when Gautama Buddha's son RƒÅhula was seven years old, he followed the Buddha, saying \\"Give me my inheritance.\\" The Buddha called Sariputta and asked him to ordain RƒÅhula, who became the first sƒÅma·πáera.  Overview  Thai novices sweeping temple grounds. In the Vinaya (monastic regulations) used by many South Asian Buddhist sects, a man under the age of 20 cannot ordain as a bhik·π£u (monk) but can ordain as a sƒÅma·πáera. SƒÅma·πáeras (and sƒÅma·πáerƒ´s ‚Äì the equivalent term for girls) keep the Ten Precepts as their code of behaviour and devote themselves to the religious life during breaks from secular schooling, or in conjunction with it if devoted to formal ordination. In other cultures and Buddhist traditions (particularly North East Asia, and those in the West that derive from these lineages), monks take different sets of vows, and follow different customary rules. The Ten Precepts upheld by sƒÅma·πáeras are: #Refrain from killing living things. #Refrain from stealing. #Refrain from unchastity (sensuality, sexuality, lust). #Refrain from lying. #Refrain from taking intoxicants. #Refrain from taking food at inappropriate times (after noon). #Refrain from singing, dancing, playing music or attending entertainment programs (performances). #Refrain from wearing perfume, cosmetics and garland (decorative accessories). #Refrain from sitting on high chairs and sleeping on luxurious, soft beds. #Refrain from accepting money. Ordination differs between sƒÅma·πáeras and srƒÅma·πáerƒ´s.  Transition to full ordination  After a year or at the age of 20, a sƒÅma·πáera will be considered for the upasampada or higher ordination as a bhik·π£u. Some monasteries will require people who want to ordain as a monk to be a novice for a set period of time, as a period of preparation and familiarization.  Ordination of women  A woman is to be ordained, according to the traditional vinayas, by both a monk and a nun, first as a ≈õrƒÅma·πáerƒ´. ≈örƒÅma·πáeras and ≈õrƒÅma·πáerƒ´s keep the Ten Precepts as their code of behaviour, and are devoted to the Buddhist religious life during a break from secular schooling, or in conjunction with it if devoted to formal ordination. After a year or at the age of 20, she will be ordained as a full bhik·π£u·πáƒ´ (Pali: bhikkhunƒ´).

The decision to build a new transmitting centre near the village of Sitkunai, about north of Kaunas was made by the Government of Lithuania in 1937. The building works started in 1939, and after completion, a 120 kW medium wave transmitter from Standard Telephones and Cables in the United Kingdom was ordered. However, the outbreak of World War II stopped the shipment. The empty transmitter buildings in Sitkunai survived the war with almost no damage and were used as military compound by the German army in 1941‚Äì1944, and later as a primary school. Because the Soviet Lithuania was badly covered by radio signals, the Soviet authorities decided to continue the building work at Sitkunai and turn the site into a main shortwave and medium wave transmitting centre. During 1951 and 1952 two 50 kW shortwave transmitters, dismantled from an East German utility site as war reparations were installed in Sitk≈´nai. Several curtain antennas were erected and one 150 kW mediumwave transmitter was installed (665 kHz). During the January Events in 1991, Sitk≈´nai Radio Station was among those transmitting sites broadcasting to the world about the Soviet military actions in Vilnius when 14 civilians were killed and more than 600 injured.http://www.zilionis.lt/rtv/qth/sit/RNW_lithuania020204.htm How Lithuania Boosted its Voice on Shortwave.

There are similar isomorphisms on symplectic manifolds. The term musical refers to the use of the symbols \\\\flat (flat) and \\\\sharp (sharp). The exact origin of this notation is not known, but the term musicality in this context would be due to Marcel Berger.see this thread In covariant and contravariant notation, it is also known as raising and lowering indices. Discussion Let be a pseudo- Riemannian manifold. Suppose } is a moving tangent frame (see also smooth frame) for the tangent bundle with, as dual frame (see also dual basis), the moving coframe (a moving tangent frame for the cotangent bundle \\\\mathrm{T}^*M. See also coframe) }. Then, locally, we may express the pseudo-Riemannian metric (which is a -covariant tensor field that is symmetric and nondegenerate) as (where we employ the Einstein summation convention). Given a vector field , we define its flat by : X^\\\\flat := g_{ij} X^i \\\\, \\\\mathbf{e}^j=X_j \\\\, \\\\mathbf{e}^j. This is referred to as \\"lowering an index\\". Using the traditional diamond bracket notation for the inner product defined by , we obtain the somewhat more transparent relation :X^\\\\flat (Y) = \\\\langle X, Y \\\\rangle for any vector fields and . In the same way, given a covector field , we define its sharp by :\\\\omega^\\\\sharp := g^{ij} \\\\omega_i \\\\mathbf{e}_j = \\\\omega^j \\\\mathbf{e}_j , where are the components of the inverse metric tensor (given by the entries of the inverse matrix to ). Taking the sharp of a covector field is referred to as \\"raising an index\\". In inner product notation, this reads :\\\\bigl \\\\langle \\\\omega^\\\\sharp, Y \\\\bigr \\\\rangle = \\\\omega(Y), for any covector field and any vector field . Through this construction, we have two mutually inverse isomorphisms : \\\\flat:{\\\\rm T} M \\\\to {\\\\rm T}^* M, \\\\qquad \\\\sharp:{\\\\rm T}^* M \\\\to {\\\\rm T} M. These are isomorphisms of vector bundles and, hence, we have, for each in , mutually inverse vector space isomorphisms between and . Extension to tensor products The musical isomorphisms may also be extended to the bundles : \\\\bigotimes ^k {\\\\rm T} M, \\\\qquad \\\\bigotimes ^k {\\\\rm T}^* M . Which index is to be raised or lowered must be indicated. For instance, consider the -tensor field . Raising the second index, we get the -tensor field :X^\\\\sharp = g^{jk} X_{ij} \\\\, {\\\\rm e}^i \\\\otimes {\\\\rm e}_k . Extension to k-vectors and k-forms In the context of exterior algebra, an extension of the musical operators may be defined on and its dual , which with minor abuse of notation, may be denoted the same, and are again mutual inverses: : \\\\flat : {\\\\bigwedge} V \\\\to {\\\\bigwedge}^* V , \\\\qquad \\\\sharp : {\\\\bigwedge}^* V \\\\to {\\\\bigwedge} V , defined by : (X \\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge Z)^\\\\flat = X^\\\\flat \\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge Z^\\\\flat , \\\\qquad (\\\\alpha \\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge \\\\gamma)^\\\\sharp = \\\\alpha^\\\\sharp \\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge \\\\gamma^\\\\sharp . In this extension, in which maps p-vectors to p-covectors and maps p-covectors to p-vectors, all the indices of a totally antisymmetric tensor are simultaneously raised or lowered, and so no index need be indicated: : Y^\\\\sharp = ( Y_{i \\\\dots k} \\\\mathbf{e}^i \\\\otimes \\\\dots \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{e}^k)^\\\\sharp = g^{ir} \\\\dots g^{kt} \\\\, Y_{i \\\\dots k} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{e}_r \\\\otimes \\\\dots \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{e}_t . Trace of a tensor through a metric tensor Given a type tensor field , we define the trace of through the metric tensor by : \\\\operatorname{tr}_g ( X ) := \\\\operatorname{tr} ( X^\\\\sharp ) = \\\\operatorname{tr} ( g^{jk} X_{ij} \\\\, {\\\\bf e}^i \\\\otimes {\\\\bf e}_k ) = g^{ji} X_{ij} = g^{ij} X_{ij} .

Cyclone Thelma was one of the most intense tropical cyclones to be observed off the coast of Australia. Thelma formed in the Arafura Sea north of the Northern Territory while intensifying rapidly into a Category 5 cyclone, passing very near the Tiwi Islands and posing a severe threat to Darwin, but passed by at a distance of . It then moved across the Timor Sea before hitting the north Kimberley coast. Thelma was the first known Category 5 cyclone to be observed in the Timor Sea, and was also the most intense cyclone to threaten Darwin since Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve in 1974. Ten months after the storm's passage, the skull of an 81-year-old man, who was believed to have been swept away by flood waters, was discovered. Meteorological history A developing low in the Timor Sea in early December was named Thelma at 2 p.m. Australian Central Standard Time (0430 UTC) on 6 December, located about north of Darwin. The new cyclone drifted slowly south while rapidly intensifying. Thelma's intensity increased from a Category 2 to a Category 4 during 7 December. Thelma turned towards the southwest and reached Category 5 intensity on the Australian scale just north of Bathurst Island at about 9 a.m. CST on 8 December (2330 UTC 7 December). The cyclone attained a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa, and maximum wind gusts of 320 km/h (200 mph) at 8 p.m. CST (1030 UTC) on the 8 December, only two days after being named. Cyclone Thelma's rate of intensification was close to twice the average rate of most cyclones. Thelma continued moving steadily southwest at about 10 km/h (6 mph) before turning southwards, passing about from Troughton Island. The cyclone weakened to a Category 3 while crossing the Kimberley coast northwest of Kuri Bay early on 11 December. The cyclone weakened rapidly while over land. Thelma was downgraded below cyclone strength late on 11 December while moving in a more southerly track. The ex-cyclone moved through the west Kimberley and Pilbara on 12 December and 13 December. On the morning of 14 December, the low crossed the Pilbara coast north of Wallal, east northeast of Port Hedland. It then moved southward through Pilbara and dissipated. Preparations All residents of major communities, including Darwin, and offshore installations directly affected by the cyclone were either evacuated or were sheltered in secure accommodation. The port of Darwin was closed during the cyclone, schools were closed for one day and public cyclone shelters were opened on the night of 8 December for people who felt insecure in their place of residence. Emergency officials evacuated about 120 people in the tiny community of Kalumburu, but about 180 people were left behind. Most of those sheltered in an old monastery which had 60 cm (24 in) thick stone walls. Impact Overall, the damage caused by Cyclone Thelma was relatively light, compared with the cyclone's severe intensity. However, Thelma still had a significant impact on people's activities near the Tiwi Islands and the Kimberley coast. In the Tiwi Islands, the most significant impact was disruption to communications and power supplies. The telephone service throughout the Tiwi Islands was shut down for over 24 hours. The radio and television reception was interrupted by heavy rain and lightning, and the power supply in Pirlangimpi (Garden Point) was cut by fallen trees. Around Bathurst Island and northwest Melville Island, there was extensive damage to vegetation in exposed areas. Minor coastal erosion occurred in Milikapiti, where waves rose up to 4 metres (13 ft) above water level. In Pirlangimpi, many large trees were uprooted and several houses were slightly damaged. In Nguiu, Bathurst Island Township, some trees were blown down but there was no significant damage. In Darwin, there was minor damage to houses and minor disruption to power supplies, caused by falling trees. A record 425 mm (16.7 in) of rain was recorded within 24 hours at Howard Springs, and a 48-hour total of 432 mm (17 in) was recorded at Darwin Airport from 8 December to 10 December. The rain caused local flooding in the rural areas around Darwin, blocking off some areas. In the Kimberley region, there was minor damage to some buildings at Kalumburu and water level in the river rose to within 50 metres (165 ft) of the town. The BHP facilities at Troughton Island were affected by very destructive winds and heavy rainfall from the cyclone's core, damaging the runway and buildings. Average wind speeds of 139 km/h (86 mph) and a maximum gust of 174 km/h (108 mph) were recorded before communications were lost. Only minor damage was received at the pearling facilities at Vansittart Bay and Kuri Bay, mainly to floating pontoons. A number of places reported daily rainfall totals in excess of 100 mm (3.9 inches) including 223 mm (8.78 in) in Kalumburu on 11 December, and 174 mm (6.85 in) in Ellendake on 13 December. McGowan Island, to the north of Kalumburu received 490 mm (19.3 in) of rain between 9 December and 13 December. Parts of east Pilbara also reported heavy rains over several days. Marble Bar recorded 239 mm (9.4 in) and Newman recorded 175 mm (6.89 in) in a two-day period.

It is a combination of amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker and benazepril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. It may be used if a single agent is not sufficient. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include cough, dizziness, and swelling. Serious side effects may include angioedema, myocardial infarction, high blood potassium, liver problems, and low blood pressure. Use in pregnancy is not recommended. Amlodipine works by increasing the size of arteries while benazepril works by decreasing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 160th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. Medical use It is used to treat high blood pressure.

In 1708, Nicolaus Laubscher (1651‚Äì1721), who had immigrated in the 1670s from the Swiss canton of Fribourg, bought a property on the slopes of Table Mountain that he called \\"Oranjezicht\\" because of the good view from there of the Oranje (Orange) bastion of the Castle.Adolphe Linder, The Swiss at the Cape of Good Hope, 1652‚Äì1971 (Basel: Basel Afrika Bibliographien, 1997), pp. 64‚Äì69.

The school's current campus, located at 1055 Fowler Avenue in Clovis, California, opened in 1969. History Clovis High School, 1908 San Joaquin College of Law, housed in the restored old Clovis High Building. From the book, Images of an Age:Images of an Age, Clovis: A Sharing of Reminiscences, Illustrations and Photographs, of the Historical Development of the Clovis Community, Its People, Schools, Organizations, Churches, and Its Surrounding Rural Areas, Written by Clovis Unified School District, Published by Clovis Unified School District, 1984: \\"Community members tried unsuccessfully to form a high school district as early as 1889. At the time, families sent their sons to Santa Clara or Stockton to schools beyond eighth grade. Daughters went to San Jose, if they went at all. Then, on June 6, 1899, Lee Beal, a Jefferson Colony Farmer, and John Rutledge, a Clovis millman, led seven school districts to join in formation of one high school district. Each of the seven elected one trustee to the board. The school was named Clovis High School, although it was the union of Red Banks, Jefferson Colony, Garfield Colony, Mississippi Settlement, Wolters Colony, Temperance Colony, and Clovis. Seventeen high school students enrolled in classes at the Clovis school. Louis K. Webb, principal and teacher, received $120 per month. Estelle Kellogg joined the staff in September. Two students, Emory Reyburn and R.E.L. Browne, graduated in the first class of 1902. A separate Clovis High School was financed by bonds in 1903, east of the railroad track between Fourth and Fifth Streets. It was replaced in 1918.\\"  In 1920, Clovis High School moved into new facilities on Fifth Street built by William Weeks. The High School remained in that building until 1969, when it moved to its current facilities on Fowler Avenue. The building on Fifth Street gradually fell into a state of disrepair, despite its historical significance for the Clovis Community. This unique building had churrigueresque arches which were patterned after the detailed baroque architecture of Spain in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. These arches were taken down by State mandate after the 1952 Kern County earthquake for safety reasons. In 1995, San Joaquin College of Law met with city leaders and negotiated a deal to bring the Law School, which was founded in 1969, to Clovis from its Fresno site. This resulted in a multimillion-dollar renovation which not only preserved the historic exterior of the building, but also preserved and reclaimed many of its unique and historic interior features. Statistics In the 2006‚Äì07 school year, Clovis High School had an enrollment of 2,518, which has probably increased, and an average class size between 22 and 33 people.

Notable people Slad is both the home and the final resting place of Laurie Lee, whose novel Cider with Rosie (1959) is a description of growing up in the village from his arrival at the age of three in 1917. Having bought a cottage there with the proceeds from the book, he returned to live permanently in the village during the 1960s after being away for some thirty years. Between 1970 and 1980 the poets Frances and Michael Horovitz lived at \\"Mullions\\", the end cottage of the settlement of Piedmont in an offshoot of the valley only accessible by foot from Slad. Frances' poetry from that period often refers to the surroundings there, as does Michael's Midsummer Morning Jog Log (1986).

A revised version was released on the Rack-It budget label.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi- bin/displaypage.pl?issue=047&page=062&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1 The heroes Blabgorians possess the gift of psychic ability which allow them to levitate and move items with their minds, as a result they evolved without hands (who needs them?), a single foot (good for bouncing) and an oversized head (handy for containing large quantities of psychic energy). Gribbly Grobbly is your typical Blabgorian, and is tasked with the safety of the 'gribblets'. 'Gribblets' are infant Blabgorians; they have an armoured shell to protect them, but when flipped on their backs they expose their vulnerable belly and are unable to right themselves. They also have an annoying tendency to leave the safety of home in search of adventure. Unfortunately Blabgor is not a safe place; there are hordes of beasts roaming the landscape, eagerly searching for vulnerable Gribblets. The Beasts ;Seed Pods: With more than a passing resemblance to sycamore seeds, seed pods fly around the landscape. They are relatively harmless, though they hurt Gribbly when he collides with them. They are vulnerable to bubbles and are easily disposed of, however once they touch the ground they turn into Topsies. ;Topsies: These mutated seed pods resemble worms with a suction cup on each end. They move backwards and forwards along the ground seeking out gribblets. When a gribblet is found, the Topsie flips the gribblet onto its back, making it vulnerable. They can still be killed by bubbles and hurt when touched. After a period of roaming the landscape, Topsies stop moving and encase themselves in a chrysalis. ;Chrysalis: These do not move and can be destroyed by bubbles, however if left unattended too long, they hatch into Stompers. ;Stompers: These resemble armoured Topsies. They cannot be killed by bubbles, however are susceptible to water and drown easily. If a Stomper encounters an overturned Gribblet, it absorbs the helpless creature and mutates yet again into a Flier. ;Fliers: These are the final stage of evolution. They are susceptible to bubbles again and when killed they release the Gribblet used to create them, however gravity quickly takes over and this freedom will be short lived unless the Gribblet falls onto flat ground or is caught in mid-air. The energy web Another challenge is a large energy web, which covers large portions of the landscape and needs to be navigated carefully. Contact with the web is painful, however certain sections of the web may be turned on and off to allow travel around the landscape. It was created to contain Seon, a mutated Blabgorian who was corrupted when he absorbed evil psi-energy. He was deemed insane and thought too dangerous to be free, so the web was meant to keep him out of trouble The game The basic premise for the game required the player to control Gribbly and navigate him through each of the 16 surreal 8-way scrolling landscapes in an attempt to locate and rescue eight baby Gribblets and returning them to the safety of the home cave. Gribbly can hop and levitate around each of the levels and can blow bubbles to defend himself. Once a Gribblet is located, Gribbly can pick up the hapless offspring and carry it to safety. Once only a single Gribblet remains on a level, the energy web fails, freeing Seon. This usually results in a mad rush to get the remaining Gribblet to safety before succumbing to his attacks. Once all the Gribblets are either saved or killed, the level ends and Gribbly is transported to the next level. Ports A port by Coin-Age to the Acorn Archimedes (titled Gribbly's Day Out on the Arc) was released in 1992. Other Seven years after its release Gribbly's Day Out featured as the theme to a secret level found in the 1992 Amiga game Fire and ICE also designed by Andrew Braybrook. This level includes Seed Pods, Gribblets and an overall Blabgor landscape.

Many patients also experience hyperphagia, hypersexuality and other symptoms. Patients generally experience recurrent episodes of the condition for more than a decade and may return at a later age. Individual episodes generally last more than a week, sometimes lasting for months. The condition greatly affects the personal, professional, and social lives of sufferers. The severity of symptoms and the course of the syndrome vary between sufferers. Patients commonly have about 20 episodes over about a decade. Several months generally elapse between episodes. The onset of the condition usually follows a viral infection; several different viruses have been observed to trigger KLS. It is generally only diagnosed after similar conditions have been excluded; MRI, CT scans, lumbar puncture, and toxicology tests are used to rule out other possibilities. The syndrome's mechanism is not known, but the thalamus is thought to possibly play a role. SPECT has shown thalamic hypoperfusion of patients during episodes. KLS is very rare, occurring at a rate of 1 in 1 million, which limits research into genetic factors. The condition primarily affects adolescent males, though females can also be affected and the age of onset varies. There is no known cure, and there is little evidence supporting drug treatment. Lithium has been reported to have limited effects in case reports, decreasing the length of episodes and duration between them in some patients.Poppe, M, Friebel, D, Reuner, U, Todt, H, Koch, R, and Heubner, G. The Kleine-Levin syndrome ‚Äì effects of treatment with lithium. Neuropediatrics 2003;34:113-9 Stimulants have been shown to promote wakefulness during episodes, but they do not counteract cognitive symptoms or decrease the duration of episodes. The condition is named after Willi Kleine and Max Levin,Levin, M. (1936). Periodic somnolence and morbid hunger: a new syndrome. Brain, 59(4), 494‚Äì504. who described cases of the disease in the early 20th century. It was added to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders in 1990. Symptoms Patients with Kleine‚ÄìLevin syndrome (KLS) experience recurring episodes of prolonged sleep (hypersomnia). In most cases, patients sleep 15 to 21 hours a day during episodes. Excessive appetite (hyperphagia) and unusual cravings are present in half to two thirds of cases. About half of patients, mainly male patients, experience dramatically increased sexual urges (hypersexuality). Several other symptoms usually accompany the syndrome, including marked changes in mood and cognitive ability. Derealization and severe apathy are present in at least 80 percent of cases. About one third of patients experience hallucinations or delusions. Depression and anxiety occur less commonly; one study found them in about 25 percent of patients. Individuals usually cannot remember what happened during episodes. Repetitive behaviors and headaches are commonly reported. Some patients act very childlike during episodes, and communication skills and coordination sometimes suffer. Sleep studies of KLS show varying results based on the amount of time the patient is observed. Slow wave sleep is often reduced at the beginning of episodes, and REM sleep is reduced near the end. Conversely, REM sleep is often normal at the beginning, and slow wave sleep is often normal by the conclusion. Stage two non-rapid eye movement sleep is often interrupted during KLS. Studies also show that stage one and three non-rapid eye movement sleep become more efficient when the episodes end. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test has yielded inconsistent results when given to KLS patients. In many cases, hours are spent in a withdrawn sleep-like state while awake during episodes. Most sleep studies have been performed while subject is near the end of their episodes. Some patients experience brief insomnia and become very happy and talkative after the episode ends. The first time a patient experiences KLS, it usually occurs along with symptoms that are similar to those of the flu or encephalitis. In at least 75 percent of cases, symptoms occur after an airway infection or a fever. Viruses observed before the development of the condition include Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, herpes zoster virus, influenza A virus subtypes, and adenovirus. Several days after symptoms first occur, patients become very tired. In cases that occur after an infection, KLS usually starts within three to five days for teenagers and fewer for children. In other cases, alcohol consumption, head injury, or international travel precede symptoms. Lifestyle habits, such as stress, alcohol abuse and lack of sleep and stress, have also been proposed as possible triggers. First episodes of KLS are preceded by a clear event in about 90 percent of cases. Recurrences generally do not have clear triggers; only about 15 percent have a precipitating event. The condition generally disrupts the social lives and academic or professional obligations of sufferers. Some patients also gain weight during episodes. The most severe cases cause a long-term impact on mood and cognitive attention. In rare cases, patients experience long-term memory problems. In patients with KLS, MRI and CT scans show normal brain morphology. When SPECT is performed, hypoperfusion can often be observed in the brain, particularly in the thalamic and frontotemporal areas. The hypoperfusion is significantly diminished between episodes. Serum biology, c-reactive proteins and leptins, the hormonal pituitary axis, and protein in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) are normal in KLS patients. Cause It is not known what causes KLS, but several mechanisms have been proposed. One possible explanation is hypothalamic or circadian dysfunction. The thalamus probably plays a role in the out-of-control sleeping, and patients with diencephalic‚Äìhypothalamic dysfunction caused by tumors experience symptoms similar to those of KLS patients. Specifically, the medial temporal regions of the thalamus may be involved, although examinations of KLS patients have not consistently found abnormalities in this area. The temporal lobe also appears to play a role in the condition, possibly causing cognitive difficulties. The apathy and disinhibition found in some KLS sufferers suggest that the condition may include frontal lobe dysfunction as well. The involvement of the thalamus, temporal lobe, and frontal lobe of the brain suggests that there is a multifocal, localized encephalopathy. There are also persistent subclinical abnormalities in KLS sufferers. Another possible explanation concerns the metabolism of serotonin and dopamine. An imbalance in the neurotransmitter pathways of these chemicals could play a role. Viral infections have also been suggested as a possible cause. Evidence for their role includes lesions found in autopsies. CSF samples from KLS patients indicate that the condition has a different cause than influenza-associated encephalopathy. Triggers of KLS may also affect the blood-brain barrier, which could play a role in the condition. There is limited evidence of what role hypocretin may play, although it often influences hypersomnia. Androgen might (indirectly) block melatonin receptors, possibly by means of vasodilation, and cause cholinergic abnormalities in some cases of Kleine‚ÄìLevin syndrome. Because KLS occurs at a much higher rate in Jews and in some families, it is likely that there is some genetic component in addition to environmental factors. Genetic studies hold promise for understanding the disease, but they have yielded inconsistent results and few patients are available for testing. Epilepsy and depression do not appear to cause KLS. The condition's rapid onset after infections indicates that the immune system is not to blame. One study has suggested a link to the gene LMOD3 on chromosome 3.Al Shareef SM, Basit S, Pfister C, Pradervand S, Lecendreux M, Mayer G, Dauvilliers Y, Salpietro V, Houlden H, BaHammam AS, Tafti M (2018) Kleine-Levin syndrome is associated with LMOD3 variants. J Sleep Res e12718 Diagnosis KLS can be diagnosed when there is confusion, apathy, or derealization in addition to frequent bouts of extreme tiredness and prolonged sleep. The earliest it can be diagnosed is the second episode, this is not common. The condition is generally treated as a diagnosis of exclusion. Because KLS is rare, other conditions with similar symptoms are usually considered first. MRIs can determine if the symptoms are caused by certain brain disorders, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. Lumbar puncture can determine if encephalitis is the cause. KLS must be differentiated from substance abuse by toxicology tests. The use of electroencephalography (EEG) can exclude temporal status epilepticus from consideration. EEGs are normal in about 70% of KLS patients, but background slowing may sometimes be detected. In addition, low-frequency high-amplitude waves can be observed during waking hours. Initially, KLS appears similar to bipolar depression. Patients with frontal-lobe syndromes and Kl√ºver-Bucy syndrome also display similar symptoms, but these conditions can be differentiated by the presence of brain lesions. KLS should also be distinguished from very rare cases of menstruation-caused hypersomnia. Prevention Lithium is the only drug that appears to have a preventive effect. In two studies of more than 100 patients, lithium helped prevent recurrence of symptoms in 20% to 40% of cases. The recommended blood level of lithium for KLS patients is 0.8‚Äì1.2 mEq/ml. It is not known if other mood stabilizers have an effect on the condition. Anti-depressants do not prevent recurrence. Treatment Several drug therapies have been used on patients with KLS, but none of them have been subject to randomized controlled trials. A 2016 Cochrane Review concluded that \\"No evidence indicates that pharmacological treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome is effective and safe\\". In several cases, stimulants, including modafinil, have been reported to have a limited effect on patients, often alleviating sleepiness. They can cause behavioral problems, but they may pose fewer issues if used in older patients with mild symptoms. In some case reports, lithium has been reported to decrease the length of episodes and the severity of their symptoms and to increase the time between episodes. It has been reported to be effective in about 25 to 60 percent of cases. Its use carries the risk of side effects in the thyroid or kidneys. Anti-psychotics and benzodiazepines can help alleviate psychotic and anxiety related symptoms, respectively. Carbamazepine has been reported to be less effective than lithium but more effective than some drugs in its class. Electroconvulsive therapy is not effective and worsens symptoms. KLS patients generally do not need to be admitted to hospitals. It is recommended that caregivers reassure them and encourage them to maintain sleep hygiene. It may also be necessary for patients to be prevented from putting themselves in dangerous situations, such as driving. Prognosis The frequency of KLS episodes can vary from attacks one week in length occurring twice a year to dozens of episodes that follow each other in close succession. The median duration of KLS episodes is about ten days, but some last several weeks or months. A study of 108 patients found an average of 19 episodes over the duration of the disease. Another study found a median of 3.5 months between episodes. Outside of episodes, there is no disturbance in patients' sleep patterns and they are generally asymptomatic. Patients do not experience the same symptoms in each episode. About 80 percent of patients are adolescents when they first experience KLS. On some occasions though, its first occurrence comes in childhood or adulthood. In most adolescent-onset patients, symptoms cease by the time they are 30 years old. A French study of 108 patients found a median duration of 13 years, but a review of 186 cases found a median duration of 8 years. Unusually young or old patients and those who experience hypersexuality tend to have a more severe course. Patients who initially have frequent attacks generally see the disease cease earlier than others. The condition spontaneously resolves, and the patient is considered to be cured if there have been no symptoms for six years. Epidemiology Population-based studies of KLS have not been performed. Its prevalence is about 1 case per million people. In France, KLS has a prevalence of 1.5 per million people. It occurs most frequently among Jews in the US and Israel. First-degree relatives of people who have suffered from the syndrome are much more likely than the general population to suffer from it, although only in about one percent of cases do family members contract it. About 70 to 90 percent of patients are male. Patients with the syndrome are more likely than the general population to have genetic disorders, and about a third of people with the syndrome encountered some form of birth difficulty. In a study of 186 older patients, about ten percent had preexisting psychiatric issues. One study found that about ten percent of patients had a neurological condition before KLS developed. The condition does not appear to occur most frequently in one season. History In 1815, there was a report of a young man who showed excessive appetite and prolonged sleep after experiencing a fever; this may have been an early description of the condition. Another case with similar symptoms was described by Brierre de Boismont in 1862. Five patients with symptoms of persistent sleepiness were described in detail in 1925 by Willi Kleine, a neurologist from Frankfurt. This report was followed four years later by details of a similar case by New York-based psychiatrist Max Levin. In 1935, Levin published information about several more cases, including one described by Kleine. Levin noted that some patients displayed an intense appetite in addition to their persistent tiredness. MacDonald Critchley, who first wrote about the condition in 1942, described 11 cases he had examined and reviewed 15 other published cases in a 1962 publication. In the report, which included patients he had examined in the Royal Navy during World War II, he observed that irritability and depersonalization often occurred while patients were awake. He named the condition Kleine‚ÄìLevin syndrome and noted four common traits: hypersexuality, adolescent onset, spontaneous resolution, and compulsive eating. He believed that the condition only affected males, but later studies showed some female patients. In the 1970s, several psychoanalytic and psychodynamic explanations for the condition were proposed. In 1980, a Hawaiian‚ÄìCaucasian family was found in which nine family members suffered from the condition. Diagnostic criteria for KLS was established by Schmidt in 1990, and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders further refined them. KLS is classified as a sleep disorder, specifically one of recurrent hypersomnia. Before 2005, hyperphagia and hypersexuality were thought to occur in all cases. That was changed with the guidelines published that year, which noted that they did not always occur.

Grant's Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson at Wilmington, Delaware, by the Harlan and Hollingsworth yard; launched on 7 June 1883; sponsored by Miss Nellie Benson, the daughter of a Harlan and Hollingsworth official; and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 23 April 1895, Captain William C. Wise in command. Rapid changes in naval technology and doctrine during the two decades she was under construction had repeatedly delayed her progress, and she was redesigned twice while still under construction.  Service history = Pre- Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  Color postcard from 1897 During the course of the late spring and summer, the monitor, assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, visited eastern seaboard ports: Savannah, Georgia (17‚Äì23 May), Port Royal, South Carolina (23 May-8 June), Brunswick, Georgia (23‚Äì28 July), Southport, North Carolina, (2‚Äì10 August) and a return visit to Port Royal (12‚Äì20 August), interspersing these port visits with operations out of Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay. Early in the course of this period of operations, the combination of defects in the design of monitors in general (inadequate ventilation for engine room forces, particularly) and the summer heat produced hellish conditions aboard Amphitrite, in some cases actually felling members of the \\"black gang\\" who had to carry out their tasks in the ship's engine and fire rooms. Following post-shakedown repairs and alterations at Norfolk, Amphitrite sailed on 20 November 1895 for Annapolis, Maryland, arriving there on the following day. Dropping down to the York River and Lynnhaven Bay soon thereafter, the monitor conducted target practice at Hampton Roads before returning to Norfolk. She then proceeded south from Norfolk on 13 December 1895 for the lower eastern seaboard of the United States. She visited Charleston, South Carolina en route, and reached Key West on 9 January 1896. She remained at Key West, drilling naval militia, for six months, departing the Florida port on 10 June for a succession of ports, Brunswick, Savannah, and Southport, ultimately arriving back at Norfolk on 29 June. She served on naval militia instruction at Norfolk until 9 July, when she accompanied the Atlantic Squadron on drills off Tolchester Beach, Maryland. She spent the next several months operating between Norfolk, Charleston, and Tompkinsville, Staten Island, into early May 1897. While operating out of Charleston between February and April 1897, she conducted underway training on the average of three days per month. Detached from the Atlantic Squadron on 7 May 1897, Amphitrite served as a training ship for the instruction of gun captains. As such, she was apparently placed in ordinary at Norfolk, since she was not recommissioned until 2 October 1897, with Capt. Charles J. Barclay in command. The men she placed in service soon proved to be invaluable in the war with Spain. Some 45 trained gun captains \\"who had received exact training fit to match the modern gun\\", gave a \\"good account of themselves\\" in action against Spanish ships. Clearing Hampton Roads on 5 October, the monitor visited New Bedford, Massachusetts, from 7‚Äì23 October, and Tompkinsville from 24 October-12 November, before she returned south, to Lambert's Point, Virginia, arriving on 14 November. Clearing Hampton Roads on 16 November, Amphitrite reached Port Royal on 19 November, and remained there for over a month. After visiting Charleston from 23 December 1897 ‚Äì 1 January 1898, she then returned to Port Royal, remaining there for over three months.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  In February 1898, tensions between the United States and Spain served as the backdrop for the explosion, in Havana Harbor, of the armored cruiser . As the U.S. and Spain moved toward war, a flurry of orders began deploying the United States Navy to be ready for hostilities. Amphitrite sailed from Port Royal on 5 April, and arrived at Key West on the 8th. She remained there until the 22nd, before she operated from that place from 22‚Äì27 April. She was at sea when the U.S. declared war on Spain, beginning the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. On 1 May, Amphitrite and her sister ship departed Key West, and shortly thereafter joined Rear Admiral William T. Sampson's fleet on the way east from its cruise off the coast of Cuba in search of Admiral Pascual Cervera's squadron. Because the monitors could not carry large amounts of coal, Sampson directed that the monitors be towed by the heavier ships. drew Amphitrite, a task recalled with little affection by the former's commanding officer, Capt. Robley D. Evans, in his autobiography: :\\"When we reached the rendezvous, late in the evening, we found there, among other ships, two monitors‚Äîthe Terror and the Amphitrite ... I was directed to tow the Amphitrite with the Iowa. The sea was very smooth, and we were soon pulling her along at nine knots, but before the job was finished I wished I had never seen a monitor. When once out from the protection of the shoals the sea began to rise, and soon everything in the way of towlines had been parted, and it was only when we slowed down to seven knots or less that we could make anything hold. We found ourselves in the open sea looking for an enemy who could steam at the speed of sixteen to eighteen knots while we could barely maintain seven. The prospect of catching him was not very bright. However, we were doing our best with the tools the Government had given us to work with ...\\" After \\"many vexatious delays\\", Evans writes, the American ships arrived off their destination, San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the afternoon of the 11th. On the morning of 12 May, Amphitrite was assigned to the 1st Division, and steamed sixth in column as Sampson's ships stood toward San Juan. The admiral had seen that there were no Spanish ships in harbor‚Äîthe object of his cruise‚Äîbut decided to attack the defenses of the port, to \\"develop their defenses and strength\\" and then turn to the westward to continue the hunt. Beneath fair skies, the American ships stood through the long swells toward their objective. Calling \\"all hands\\" at 04:00 to complete preparations for action, the ships went to general quarters an hour later. Iowa began the action at 05:16 with her forward 6-pounders. For two and a half hours, the ships bombarded the Spanish positions at San Juan. Amphitrite hurled 17 10-inch (254-mm) shells shoreward, as well as 30 4-inch (102-mm) shells, 30 3-pounders, and 22 6-pounders in the course of the action. The blast from the ship's 10-inch (254-mm) guns destroyed the gig and railings on the superstructure, and other items of minor damage which did not \\"destroy in any degree the efficiency of the vessel\\". The chronic irritation of the ship- poor ventilation -afflicted the ship in the course of the action, when a gunner's mate on duty in the after turret died from the heat. Amphitrites Capt. Barclay commented on the lamentable conditions in his after-action report, pointing out that when the ship was closed up at action stations, the \\"utter lack of ventilation below ...\\" produced \\"heat so intense as to render it almost impossible for men stationed there to remain at their posts.\\" Toward the end of the action, Amphitrite lost the services of half of her main battery, when an armored hose on the exhaust pipe of the after turret burst, disabling it \\"at a moment when it could have rendered very efficient service.\\" The monitor had sent the signal to the flagship that her after turret had been disabled, at 19:12; at 19:45, Iowa sounded \\"secure\\". Sampson's fleet then formed column to the northwest and retired. Amphitrite returned to Key West, her base of operations, on 19 May, and remained there until the 24th. Over the next two and a half months, Amphitrite operated put of Key West on blockade duty, expanding her area of operations to include waters off Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti, in late July, shortly before she was ordered to Cape San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 2, the designated landing site for the U.S. Army invasion of Puerto Rico. Anchored behind a key just offshore and out of sight of the mainland since 1 August, on the evening of 6 August, Captain Barclay sent two boat parties ashore containing 28 sailors and 7 officers from Amphitrite under command of Lt. Charles N. Atwater and Passed Assistant Engineer David J. Jenkins, with orders to relight and occupy the Cape San Juan Light. They were also ordered to quarter 60 women and children of the town of Fajardo that were deemed in danger for having sided with the Americans.Los incidentes de Fajardo 3 al 7 de agosto de 1898 Tragically, Cadet William H. Boardman was mortally wounded when his revolver dislodged from its faulty holster, fell to the marble floor and fired into his left inner thigh as he was entering the darkened lighthouse with three sailors. That night, Boardman was evacuated to Amphitrite, where he died two days later. Boardman was one of only 23 combat- related U.S. Navy deaths during the entire Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the only Navy death during Puerto Rican operations.Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy for the Year 1898, Appendix to the Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, p. 650-657 After learning of the American presence, on 4 August, Governor General Manuel Mac√≠as y Casado sent Colonel Pedro del Pino and about 220 troops, including civil guardsmen to recapture the town. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo on the afternoon of 7 August, he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo Light and the surrounding hills. At close to midnight on 8 August, Pino's troops began their assault on the lighthouse. The landing party of Amphitrites sailors occupying the lighthouse doused the light and signaled the ships offshore, initiating shore bombardment as the naval guns began firing a protective pattern. After two hours exchanging small arms and machine gun fire with the Americans in the lighthouse, the Spanish forces retreated back to Fajardo. The Americans suffered no casualties, despite a close call when a wayward naval shell smashed through the thick walls of the lighthouse within touch of six men but failed to explode. The Spanish losses were two dead and three wounded, including a lieutenant. Early the next morning, Captain Barclay decided the continued occupation of the lighthouse was of marginal value and ordered his men back to the ship. A landing party of 30 sailors from Amphitrite and a similar number of U.S. Marines from the protected cruiser under Lieutenant John A. Lejeune came ashore to secure the area while the 60 Fajardan civilians boarded the armed tug for passage to Ponce. The bluejackets closed the lighthouse, left the U.S. flag flying and returned to the ship. In Fajardo, Pino's men tore down the U.S. flags that flew over the harbor Customs House and City Hall, returning to San Juan after verifying that the lighthouse was abandoned. The contingent of about 20 civil guards that had accompanied Pino, were left to maintain order in the town. The Battle of Fajardo was the only time that American forces withdrew from a position during the Puerto Rican Campaign. Amphitrite departed Cape San Juan on 18 August for Gu√°nica, Puerto Rico, arriving the following day, and lingered there until 31 August, on which day she sailed for St. Nicholas Mole, Haiti. Proceeding then to Hampton Roads, she arrived there on 20 September. Departing that port six days later on 26 September, Amphitrite moved up to Boston, Massachusetts, where she remained from 29 September 1898 ‚Äì 25 February 1899.  Pre-World War I  Training ship = For the next few months, Amphitrite operated off the eastern seaboard of the United States, off Sandy Hook, out of Hampton Roads, and out of Port Royal before she returned to Hampton Roads from 21 to 30 May 1899 for gunnery instruction. She subsequently visited Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Newport, Rhode Island, and New Bedford. Owing to her light draft and steady platform, Amphitrite was deemed well adapted for gunnery work, and received on board two classes a year consisting of 60 men. From 1 July-4 October 1899, the monitor carried out gunnery instruction out of New Bedford, and on 12 October sailed for the New York Navy Yard for necessary repairs. Upon completion of this yard period, Amphitrite sailed for Port Royal on 3 December, stopping en route at Norfolk for coal and ammunition. Arriving at her destination on 9 December, she commenced her gunnery training course nine days later. On 17 January 1900, the tug was turned over to Amphitrite and fitted with a battery of one 6-pounder and one 1-pounder; for the remainder of the course, the tug proved a valuable adjunct to the monitor, serving as an \\"economical, handy, and effective moving platform\\" for moving subcaliber practice. Amphitrite completed her work at Port Royal on 19 April and proceeded north, accompanied by Chickasaw, stopping at Norfolk en route, and reached Tompkinsville on 9 May, proceeding thence to New Bedford, arriving there on 14 June. The tug subsequently replaced Chickasaw as Amphitrites tender, joining the monitor off New Bedford on 25 June 1900. Amphitrite carried out her gunnery training until departing New Bedford on 5 October for the Boston Navy Yard, where she underwent repairs from 7 October-14 November. Receiving drafts of men for gunnery class at Tompkinsville and Norfolk, the monitor proceeded back to Port Royal, arriving there on 29 November. Outside a brief port visit to Brunswick, Ga., from 28 January-6 February 1901, Amphitrite remained at Port Royal until 10 May, when she sailed for Norfolk and Tompkinsville, arriving at the latter on 3 June, en route back to her ultimate destination of New Bedford. Amphitrite continued the important work of training gun captains through the summer and into the fall. Deemed in need of a general overhaul, Amphitrite was placed out of commission at the Boston Navy Yard on 30 November 1901. Recommissioned at Boston on 1 December 1902, Lt. Comdr. Edwin H. Tellman in command, Amphitrite was ordered to the Naval Training Station at Newport, for duty, on 10 January 1903. She served there until early in 1904, when she was sent to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, for duty as station ship. She performed this duty until detached on 19 June 1907, and was placed out of commission at League Island on 3 August 1907. Placed in commission, in reserve, on 14 June 1910, Amphitrite was assigned to duty, training reservists in the Missouri Naval Militia, at St. Louis, Missouri, under the command of Chief Boatswain Patrick Shanahan, a duty she performed until assigned to training reservists at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 12 May 1912. Detached from this duty four years later, on 12 May 1916, the ship then proceeded to New Haven, Connecticut, for assignment with the naval militia of the state of Connecticut.  World War I  Amphitrite cleared Bridgeport, Connecticut, on 2 February 1917 for repairs and alterations at the New York Navy Yard, arriving the following day, 2 February. On 17 February, the ship departed the yard and stood down river to the Narrows, near Rosebank, Staten Island, NY, for work on the submarine net in company with three tugs, Hudson, W. J. Conway, and Lizzie D., and Navy lighters , Transport, and the tug S. W. Holbrook. Later, in company with M. M. Millard, George T. Kirkham, and John Nichols, she continued her work laying the net off Rosebank. After further repairs at the Navy Yard from 2‚Äì17 March Amphitrite resumed duty with the Naval Militia of Connecticut, arriving at New Haven on 18 March. She carried out this training duty, with drafts of men from Yale and Harvard for instruction in ordnance, signalling, and seamanship, into early April. With the entry of the U.S. into World War I at that time, Amphitrite departed New Haven on 7 April for the New York Navy Yard and repairs and alterations. She returned to Rosebank to guard the nets on 15 April. She was assigned to the 3d Naval District on 27 April 1917. Assigned the duty of examining all ships entering or leaving New York harbor (except Army or Navy ships which identified themselves by exchange of signals), Amphitrite also received all reports of submarine activity with the waters off the district. At night, she trained her searchlights on the nets at regular intervals or to allow passage of authorized vessels. Such duty was not without hazard. At 19:16 on 13 June 1917, the steamship was standing out of New York Harbor in a thick fog and collided with Amphitrite, suffering damage below the waterline. Attempting to clear, Manchuria scraped the guardship's bow, and her propeller strut fouled her cable, holding her fast for 20 minutes. Manchuria lowered her boats and abandoned ship; two section patrol boats and a motor sailer stood by and took life boats in tow. Ultimately, Manchuria was towed and beached off Tompkinsville, while Amphitrite continued her net-tending duties. On 26 October, the guardship proceeded to the New York Navy Yard for repairs, remaining there until 20 November, when she returned to her station at Rosebank. She was carrying out her duties there when, on 14 December 1917, the British steamship British Isles collided with her during a heavy snow squall, doing not only considerable damage to Amphitrite but to the torpedo nets at the Narrows as well. Following repairs, Amphitrite remained on duty at Rosebank, interspersing guardship duties with upkeep and repairs at the New York Navy Yard, into October 1918. Leaving New York on 24 October for Hampton Roads, Amphitrite carried out standardization runs and target practice at Tangier Sound in late October and the first week of November; on 8 November, she left Tangier Sound, via Hampton Roads, for Rosebank. She arrived back at Staten Island on 11 November 1918, the day the war ended in Europe with the armistice. Ultimately, Amphitrite left New York for Philadelphia on 30 April 1919, arriving on 1 May. On 30 December 1918, was assigned as tender to Amphitrite and served as a dispatch ship. Amphitrite was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 31 May 1919 and stricken from the Navy List on 24 July 1919. On 3 January 1920, she was sold to A. L. D. Bucksten of Elizabeth City, North Carolina.  Post-war Commercial service  Stripped of her turrets and superstructure, the ship was towed to Beaufort, South Carolina, where she was used as a floating hotel. She was subsequently towed to Florida for the same purpose, and it was rumored that \\"a certain amount of fashionable gambling was carried out on board.\\" Notorious gangster Al Capone was rumored to have been interested in the erstwhile warship. Chartered by the government in 1943, the ship was towed via inland waters to Elizabeth City, where she provided housing facilities for the workers building a new naval air station there. Following World War II, she lay alongside a wharf at Georgetown, South Carolina, whence she was towed to Baltimore, Maryland, in the spring of 1950. She was placed into a slip dredged into the bank at Sandy Point, near where the new Chesapeake Bay Bridge was to be built, but business for a floating restaurant and hotel proved slow and she was sold again in the spring of 1951, and was taken to Baltimore. Plans to refit the ship for work supporting oil exploration in the Venezuelan oil fields came to naught, and the ship was sold to the Patapsco Steel Corp., Fairfield, Maryland. By the spring of 1952, the scrapping had been completed.

Kaley's amnesia leaves her immune to the monster's attacks, and the only one who can stop it. Film In October 2007, at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival in Portland, Oregon, Mnemovore co-creator Hans Rodionoff screened a 10-minute sample reel for a proposed feature film based on the comic book. The sample reel features Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) as Kaley Markowic, and Michael Biehn (The Terminator) as her therapist. Rodionoff stated that the film will be executive produced by Guillermo del Toro, and produced by Don Murphy and Susan Montford. Rodionoff has written the script, and is set to direct as well. The film is currently in the funding stage, and Bell and Biehn are not currently signed to appear.

Class I PI 3-kinases are further divided into two subclasses, class IA PI 3-kinases and class IB PI 3-kinases. Class IA PI 3-kinases Class IA PI 3-kinases are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). There are three catalytic subunits that are classified as class IA PI 3-kinases: *p110Œ± *p110Œ≤ *p110Œ¥ There are currently five regulatory subunits that are known to associate with class IA PI 3-kinases catalytic subunits: *p85Œ± and p85Œ≤ *p55Œ± and p55Œ≥ *p50Œ± Class IB PI 3-kinases Class IB PI 3-kinases are activated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
