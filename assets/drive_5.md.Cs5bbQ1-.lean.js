Sandler is best known for his work establishing and elucidating the phenomenon of meiotic drive. (Meiotic drive is when one copy of a gene is passed on to offspring more than the expected 50% of the time.) Sandler earned a B.S. at Cornell University and did his doctoral work with Ed Novitski at the University of Missouri, where he collaborated with Gerry Braver.Dan Lindsley, \\"Larry Sandler: The Father of Meiotic Drive\\", The American Naturalist, Vol. 137, No. 3, pp.283-286 (March 1991). Braver and Sandler discovered that meiotic chromosomal loss was one driver of allelic variation in natural populations, (Sandler & Braver 1954.Sandler & Braver 1954) a phenomenon coined \\"meiotic drive\\" in a follow-up paper by Sandler and Novitski. (Sandler & Novitski 1957.Sandler & Novitski 1957) Sandler also collaborated with Iris Sandler, his wife and fellow scientist, who also worked as a graduate student in Novitski's lab. In 1956, Sandler briefly joined the Biology Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where Sandler and Dan Lindsley worked on sperm dysfunction. After joining the lab of Jim Crow at the University of Wisconsin, Sandler and Yuichiro Hiraizumi began working on segregation distortion, publishing several papers together.B. Ganetzky, \\"Yuichiro Hiraizumi and forty years of segregation distortion\\", Genetics (1999). Sandler moved to the University of Washington in 1962. There he supervised numerous graduate students who joined the field, including Bruce Baker, Adelaide T. Carpenter, Ian Duncan, Barry Ganetzky, Larry Goldstein, Kent Golic, Jeff Hall, Scott Hawley, Jim Mason, John Merriam, Joe O'Tousa, Leonard Robbins, Paul Szauter, Bill Sullivan, Jon Tomkiel, and Glenn Yasuda. Sandler was professionally active, involved in the founding of the Drosophila Research Conference, and transferring it to the Genetics Society of America. He was also involved with other conferences, including the International Congress of Genetics, and as editor with numerous genetics journals, including Annual Review of Genetics and Genetics.

It is a potential space in the head and is paired on each side. It is located between the medial pterygoid muscle and the medial surface of the ramus of the mandible. The pterygomandibular space is one of the four compartments of the masticator space. Location and structure Anatomic boundaries The boundaries of each pterygomandibular space are: * the posterior border of the buccal space anteriorly * the parotid gland posteriorly * the lateral pterygoid muscle superiorly * the inferior border of the mandible (lingual surface) inferiorly * the medial pterygoid muscle medially (the space is superficial to medial pterygoid) * the ascending ramus of the mandible laterally (the space is deep to the ramus of the mandible) Communications The communications of each pterygomandibular space are: * to the buccal space anteriorly * to the lateral pharyngeal space and peritonsillar space medially (around the medial pterygoid muscle). * to the submasseteric space laterally (around the ramus of the mandible) * to the parotid space posteriorly * to the deep temporal/infratemporal space superiorly Contents In health, the space contains: * the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, * the inferior alveolar artery and vein, * the sphenomandibular ligament. Clinical relevance The pterygomandibular space is the area where local anesthetic solution is deposited during an inferior alveolar nerve block, a common procedure used to anesthetize the distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve. Rarely, pathogenic micro-organisms from the mouth may be seeded into the pterygomandibular space during this injection and cause a needle tract infection of the space. It is also occasionally reported that the needle breaks off and is retained in the pterygomandibular space during this injection. Minor oral surgery is then required to remove the fractured needle. Due to its high vascularity, injections into the pterygomandibular space carry a high risk of intravascular injection (injecting into a blood vessel). Another possible complication of an inferior alveolar nerve block occurs when the needle is placed too deep, passing through the pterygomandibular space and into the parotid gland behind. Branches of the facial nerve (which gives the motor supply to the muscles of facial expression) run through the substance of the parotid gland and so this is manifest as a transient facial palsy. The pterygomandibular space is one of the possible spaces into which a tooth may be displaced into during dental extraction, e.g. of a maxillary wisdom tooth. A mandibular fracture in the angle region may also be the cause of a pterygomandibular space infection. The signs and symptoms of an isolated pterygomandiublar infection may include trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), however there is not usually any externally visible facial swelling. Intra-orally, there may be swelling and erythema (redness) or the anterior tonsillar pillar (the Palatoglossal arch) and deviation of the uvula to the unaffected side. The airway may be compressed. Treatment is by surgical incision and drainage, and the incision may be placed inside the mouth or two incisions may be used, one inside the mouth and one outside. Odontogenic infections Odontogenic infections may spread to involve the pterygomandibular space, and the most common teeth responsible for this are the mandibular second and third molar teeth.

Lopez was a psychologist who worked as a senior scientist for Gallup and as research director of The Don Clifton Strengths Institute. He was also a fellow of the American Psychological Association. His research focused on hope which aims to show that investing in one's future reaps immediate rewards. Lopez was also a vocal advocate for a psychological reform of America's education system with the goal of aiding schools to operate in a manner that encourages dynamic development and enables students to achieve meaningful futures that they desire. His research studies the relationship between hope, strengths development, academic success and general well-being. A great deal of his research specializes in hope and strengths enhancement for students from preschool through college graduation. Lopez died on July 23, 2016.  Research  Lopez's research suggests that hopeful students see the future as better than the present and believe they have the power to create an improved future. Lopez defines hope as the ideas and energy one has for the future; one of the most important predictors of success for youth. Lopez's survey of research on hope has indicated that hope is not significantly related to native intelligence nor income. However it is consistently linked to school attendance, credits earned, and academic achievement. Hopeful students are more successful because they are able to develop the strategies to reach goals and have the energy to plan alternate means in the event of possible deterrents. These obstacles are viewed as challenges to be overcome and can be bypassed with alternative pathways. Hopeful students expect good outcomes and focus on success and therefore experience greater positive affect and less distress. Additionally people who have more hope tend to experience less anxiety and less stress, specifically in test-taking situations. Conversely, students who lack sufficient hope, are stuck, or discouraged, may lack the energy to get things accomplished. These students are more likely to give up when encountering obstacles to goals because they are unable to think of alternative pathways or unable to get the support they need. This is likely to result in frustration as well as reduced confidence and self-esteem. Hence these students experience high anxiety, especially in test-taking situations. Additionally, less hopeful students don't use feedback from failures to make changes in the future.

In 2012‚Äì13 he spent his fourth season as an assistant coach for the University of Southern California (USC) men's basketball team after having retired from professional basketball at the end of 2007‚Äì08. Miller was a two- time Dutch League All-Star in 1998 and 2000. During his collegiate career at Marquette University, Miller recorded 956 assists, which as of the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season still remains the eighth-highest total in NCAA Division I history. Early life Miller was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School (VASJ) where he was a two-sport star between basketball and football. Miller was the starting point guard for all four seasons in basketball and led them to a state championship as a senior in 1991‚Äì92. In football, he became the starting quarterback in his sophomore season, succeeding future National Football League quarterback Elvis Grbac. Miller led the football squad to a state championship as a junior, a feat Grbac did not even accomplish. He wasn't heavily recruited from college basketball teams because it was thought he would play football at the next level instead, but then-Marquette head coach Kevin O'Neill was persistent in his recruitment, and eventually Miller signed to play for the Warriors. College In his four-year career spanning from 1991‚Äì92 and 1994‚Äì95, Miller started all 123 games in which he played. For his career he averaged 8.3 points and 7.8 assists while finishing with 1,027 and 956, respectively. His assists total ranks seventh all-time in Division I history, and was fifth all- time when he graduated. In his sophomore and junior seasons, Miller was the catalyst for Marquette's back-to-back NCAA Tournament berths; in the 1994 tournament, he was the primary reason why Marquette was able to break Kentucky's full-court press as the Warriors upset the Wildcats to advance to the Sweet 16. As a senior, Marquette were the runners-up in the 1995 National Invitation Tournament. Miller was a three-time Great Midwest Conference Second Team selection from 1993 to 1995. Professional career Miller played professional basketball from 1995‚Äì96 through 2007‚Äì08. In 13 seasons he played for different teams in the United States, Belgium, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In 1997‚Äì98 and 1999‚Äì2000 he was a Dutch League All- Star. Miller finished his professional career playing in the British Basketball League for the Everton Tigers. Coaching career Miller's first job came in 2009‚Äì10 as the strength and conditioning manager for USC. He was hired by his former head coach at Marquette, Kevin O'Neill, who was then the USC head coach. In 2010‚Äì11, Miller was promoted to a full-time assistant coach position. He was not retained when Andy Enfield took over as head coach in 2013‚Äì14. Miller spent the 2013‚Äì14 season as an assistant coach at St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower, California, where he helped the team win a Division 2 state championship. He then moved on to become an assist for Cal State Los Angeles for two seasons before retiring from coaching.

The British captured her in 1800, but did not take her into service. Design Garnier designed Ligurienne to plans by Fran√ßois-Fr√©d√©ric Poncet, following the design specifications of General Napoleon Bonaparte. What Napoleon wanted was a ship whose hull could be split into eight sections, joined by screw bolts so that she could be dismantled, carried in 10 wagons over land, and then be re-assembled on reaching water again. This would permit the French to transfer the ship from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, there being no Suez Canal at the time. She had 16 gun-ports, and seven small ports for oars. Career On 21 March 1800, and captured Ligurienne while she was off Marseilles escorting a convoy from Cette to Toulon. Ligurienne was under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Fran√ßois Auguste Pelabon. Her consorts, the demi-ch√©becs Cerf and Lejoille, ran aground; Ligurienne resisted until 6pm before striking her colours.Troude, p.204 The French apparently were able later to refloat Cerf and Lejoille. English account Peterel, under the command of Francis Austen, the brother of author Jane Austen and future admiral of the fleet, was sailing near Marseille with the frigate Mermaid. On 21 March 1800, Peterel spotted a large convoy with three escorts: the brig- sloop Ligurienne, armed with fourteen brass 6-pounder guns and two brass 36-pounder howitzers, the corvette Cerf, of fourteen 6-pounder guns, and the xebec Lejoille, of six 6-pounder guns. Peterel captured a bark of 350 tons and a bombarde (ketch) of 150 tons, both carrying wheat and which their crews had abandoned, and sent them off with prize crews; later that afternoon the escorts caught up to Peterel and attacked. Mermaid was in sight but a great distance to leeward and so unable to assist. Single-handedly, Peterel drove Cerf and Lejoille on shore, and after a 90-minute battle captured Ligurienne, which lost Pelabon and one sailor killed and two sailors wounded out of her crew of 104 men; there were no British casualties. Some British accounts declare that Cerf was a total loss but that the French were able to salvage Lejoille. The whole action took place under the guns of two shore batteries and so close to shore that Peterel grounded for a few minutes. One month after the action, Austen received promotion post captain.Long (185), pp.104-5. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Peterel 21 March 1800\\" to the two surviving claimants from the action. Fate The British sent Ligurienne into Plymouth. Austen recommended, without success, that the Navy purchase Ligurienne, which was less than two years old. Citations References  * *Long, William H.

Matisse initially gained notoriety for her series of Missing Person paintings, in which she appropriated and embellished upon, or subtracted from, recognizable works from art history. Media coverage is often quick to note Matisse's family background, an art pedigree originating with her great-grandfather, the 20th century painter Henri Matisse. Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper in 2003 referred to Matisse as \\"art royalty\\", a term occasionally paraphrased when discussing Matisse and her artwork. Early life Matisse was born in Boston on February 13, 1965, and was raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, having what has been described as a \\"hippie childhood\\". Her father is the sculptor Paul Matisse, whose grandfather was Henri Matisse. Matisse had \\"serious\\" dyslexia in her youth, which she remedied through creative pursuits. Education Matisse began studies in 1985 at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston, but she dropped out after her first year. In 1990, she relocated to Paris and attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, the same institution where her great-grandfather Henri Matisse had studied. She also bought supplies at the same art-supply store where he had shopped. Matisse lived with her grandmother Teeny Duchamp in France for a time. Teeny, after divorcing Pierre Matisse, had married the French artist Marcel Duchamp (Duchamp died in 1968). Studies at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts were not easy for Matisse; not only facing imposed expectations of being an art student in France named \\"Matisse\\", but also being an American lacking proficiency in reading and writing French. After three years Matisse was asked to leave. She did, however, meet the French artist Alain Jacquet while at √âcole des Beaux-Arts, whom she married in 1992. Early career In 1996, Matisse moved to New York City, setting up her studio in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood, and soon began exhibiting her artwork. The artist's 1997 painting Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes) initiated art world interest which furthered her career. In the painting, Matisse replicated the background setting of Leonardo da Vinci's original, but omitted the eponymous subject Mona Lisa from the scene. It was the first of what became her signature Be Back in 5 Minutes series. The Be Back in Five Minutes series gave Matisse her first widespread exposure as an artist, in her own right, and informed her work for years thereafter. In those paintings, Matisse reproduced the recognizable settings of famous paintings, always omitting the figures; as if the models had \\"stepped out for the moment\\". Famous works of Vermeer also figured prominently in other early entries to the series; Young Woman with a Water Pitcher, The Art of Painting, and Girl with a Pearl Earring were all reinterpreted by Matisse in the late 1990s, minus the figures portrayed by Vermeer. Exhibitions Although she had previously participated in group exhibitions in New York and elsewhere, Matisse's first solo exhibition opened in January 2002, at the gallery which continued to represent her in New York, Francis Naumann Fine Art. It was the gallery's first exhibition of Contemporary art. Matisse's Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes) was featured in this first exhibition along with over twenty others of the artist's absentee paintings. Among American artworks from which Matisse \\"removed\\" the occupants are Grant Wood's American Gothic, in which the pitchfork is left standing alone in the foreground, and Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, in which the diner is replicated devoid of customers and staff. Both of these were painted in 2001. The artwork of Henri Matisse is also among those reinterpreted. Goldfish reproduces the scene as originally portrayed by him, minus the goldfish. The Conversation leaves an empty chair by the window. Artwork from this series was also assembled for an exhibition titled \\"Once Removed\\" at the upstate New York Katonah Museum of Art in the summer of 2005. Matisse's reinterpretation of Guernica In 2003, Matisse added Pablo Picasso's Guernica to the number of paintings she reinterpreted. This time, Matisse opted to \\"colorize\\" Picasso's monochromatic \\"anti-war testament\\" ‚Äî a painting to which she had never actually stood \\"face to face\\". Despite her great- grandfather and Picasso's \\"rocky relationship\\". Matisse followed her own color sensibilities, as opposed to mimicking those of her great-grandfather. Matisse used Guerra Paint acrylics and painted on canvas, testing color combinations by first painting many small sketches. She kept true to the impact of Picasso's original by painting it large-scale, approximately . Her efforts yielded several paintings and various drawings, which culminated in her Sophie Matisse Does Guernica exhibition, early in 2003 in New York. One piece, 911 Guernica, uses Guernica as the motif to convey her own first hand experiences witnessing the terrorist attack on New York's Twin Towers from her neighborhood near the site. Matisse's Guernica exhibition was scheduled to coincide with the Museum of Modern Art's dual survey exhibiting the works of both Picasso and Matisse. The artist and her \\"Be Back in 5 minutes\\" series faced as much opposition as they did praise, with some critics deriding her \\"coloring-in\\" of Picasso by comparing it with the colorization of black and white movies. Art critic Arthur Danto said Matisse's work \\"demonstrates why Picasso was right to use black and white and gray, and why Matisse was exactly right never to have attempted to depict violence\\". Matisse in 2003 also participated in a project coordinated by Dodie Kazanjian for Vogue magazine. \\"Self Portraits: A Vogue Portfolio\\" appeared in print as a ten-page feature in the December 2003, issue of the magazine. As the title suggests, each artist submitted a \\"self-portrait\\". Matisse was featured among other female artists of her generation such as Kiki Smith. Matisse's contribution was a \\"Be Back in 5 Minutes\\" interpretation of Gustave Courbet's erotic painting The Origin of the World, this time removing the 19th century French painter's graphically portrayed nude model, leaving only the rumpled bedsheets. The completed artworks were exhibited at Deitch Projects SoHo gallery space at the time of publication. Zebra stripe paintings Matisse began a new series of paintings in the Spring of 2004, which culminated in her third solo exhibition, the Zebra Stripe Paintings, debuting in New York in the latter months of 2005. Matisse once again appropriated historically significant artworks, this time superimposing her own imagery in the form of zebra stripes overlapping the originals. In these paintings, all acrylics and oil on canvas, the appropriated originals are somewhat obscured by the stripes, rendering them less readily identifiable, and the artist herself has joked that her dyslexia may have been helpful in creating these works. The series was compared to James Rosenquist's later works, juxtaposing and overlapping seemingly unrelated imagery. Matisse again appropriated one of her great- grandfather's artworks, this time overlaying his Blue Nude with her zebra stripes. Special projects Matisse has provided artwork in collaboration with business interests and also in support of charitable causes. In 2008, She collaborated with Kilian Hennessy, heir to the Hennessy lineage of cognac makers, providing artwork for a line of fragrances. Matisse added her personal touch to fifty bottles of Kilian perfumes, hand-painting, signing and numbering every bottle and its box. Each of the limited edition creations bore a design different from the others. Additionally, Matisse collaborated with @byKilian in December 2009 on 15 hand-painted, Special Edition (Gold) perfume bottles, which were sold to key By Kilian clients. For an exhibition titled The Art of the Game coinciding with San Diego's Beyond the Border International Contemporary Art Fair of 2009, Matisse created five chess sets of her own design. She considered her participation \\"a tribute\\" to the game's presence within her family in general, and her upbringing personally. In 2010, Matisse participated in the New York installment of an international campaign produced by the non-profit group Sing For Hope. The project called for 60 pianos to be placed in specifically chosen public places around a chosen city, in this case New York City, each first hand-painted by participating artists and amateurs alike. The decorated pianos remained at their specified locations for two weeks in July 2010, with the instructions \\"Play me, I'm yours\\" clearly marked, and an attendant present to oversee and invite passersby. Matisse hand-painted four Kimball pianos, all of which had been donated for the cause, even painting the piano keys. Some, if not all, of Sophie's four were displayed in the lobby of Avery Fisher Hall and Lincoln Center promenade. All 60 pianos were auctioned that fall. Matisse was represented by Francis Naumann Fine Art, LLC, in New York City. from 2003 to 2020. Matisse is now represented by the Baahng Gallery in New York City. Personal life In 1992, when she was 27, Matisse married Pop artist Alain Jacquet, whom she had met during her years at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Jacquet similarly reworked classic artworks into his own creations, which have been described as \\"Pop subterfuge\\". The marriage produced a daughter, Ga√Øa Jacquet-Matisse, born in 1993. Matisse and Jacquet were considered a \\"perfect couple\\" by friends and acquaintances, and remained married until Jacquet's death, at age 69, in 2008. Matisse later married Amar Zribi in St. Martin FWI, in 2012. Family background Matisse's father is the sculptor and inventor Paul Matisse, a Harvard graduate. Her grandfather, Paul's father, was Modern art dealer Pierre Matisse, who had moved to America in the 1920s. Pierre was the youngest child of 20th century painter Henri Matisse, Sophie's great-grandfather. Henri Matisse died in 1954, aged 85, eleven years before Sophie's birth. Family members expressed concern for Sophie's future as an artist in her own right, and suggested she use her great grandmother, Amelie Pareyre as her family name to avoid constant comparison to Henri Matisse. Only by incidentally noticing her family name on museum walls did Sophie, as a young child, come to consider that her great-grandfather may have been someone \\"exceptional\\". Matisse's step-grandfather was the artist Marcel Duchamp, who reinterpreted Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa in his L.H.O.O.Q. by adding a mustache. Duchamp married Matisse's grandmother Alexina \\"Teeny\\" Matisse, an American, in 1954 after she and Pierre Matisse had divorced. Matisse has cited Duchamp as an influence, once saying \\"his presence stopped me from getting too serious\\". Art writers have pointed to the \\"visual jokes\\" sometimes apparent in Matisse's own work as a sign of Duchamp's influence.

The original Obikhod, the book of rites of the monastery of Volokolamsk, was composed about 1575. Among its subjects were traditional liturgical chants. The Obikhod was originally monodic but later developed polyphony. In 1772 the Obikhod was the first compilation of music printed in Russia, in Moscow. The common version was extensively revised and standardized by composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov; this version was published as the 1909 edition of the Obikhod, the last before the Russian Revolution. The Obikhod style, and the 1909 edition, was predominately used by the Russian Orthodox Church during the decades of Soviet Union rule in the 20th century, displacing both traditional Russian styles, such as the Ruthenian Prostopinije style, and also the chant traditions of Georgia, Armenia, and Carpatho-Russia.John Anthony McGuckin, The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, 2010, p406. Quote: \\"During the Soviet period, Russian obikhod-style choral polyphony all but eradicated the received chant traditions of Georgia, Armenia, and Carpatho-Russia, but currently there is a trend to revive the Znamenny, Iberian, and Ruthenian chant ...\\" Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky drew from the Obikhod style for his 1812 Overture, as did Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in his Russian Easter Festival Overture. Anatoly Lyadov also drew from them in his Ten Arrangements from Obikhod Op.61, as did Alexander Raskatov in his Obikhod (2002). The pitch set used in these chants traditionally consists of four three-note groups. Each note within a group is separated by a whole tone, and each group is separated by a semitone. If starting from G, the result is: G, A, B / C, D, E / F, G, A / B‚ô≠, C, D. Theoretically, more groups can be added either above or below, which has been done by some 20th-century Russian composers. This pitch set also influenced Russian folk music: for example, the Livenka accordion contains the pitch set on its melody side.

It came there from Cannon Street Road and traced its roots to one of the early Independent congregations which met from 1642 at Haydon's Yard, Minories, and then in Smithfield. History The chapel in New Road (the original name of part of Cannon Street Road) was built in 1780, with a schoolroom added in 1785 and a Sunday School in 1790. It was long and narrow, seating up to 800 people, and lit by brass chandeliers holding candles (which had to be trimmed mid- service). It had a large burial ground, whose story is recounted here and here. Its minister from 1811 was the noted philanthropist Rev Dr Andrew Reed (1787-1862). In 1831 it moved to larger premises in a new building named Wycliffe Chapel, in Philpot Street; here the congregation grew from 100 to 2,000. Reed had been a watchmaker's apprentice and worked at his parents' china shop in Butcher Row - Beaumont House, dating from 1581 and named for the French ambassador who lived there in the time of King James I; ornamented with roses, crowns, fleurs-le-lys and dragons, it was demolished in 1813. He became a member of the congregation when Thomas Bryson was the minister. Bryson's successor was Samuel Lyndall, trained at Rotherham Academy, and formerly a minister in Bridlington; in 1805 he published a sermon on Popery. In 1813, from his home in St George's Place, the East London Orphan Asylum was established, initially based at a house in Clark[e]'s Terrace, Cannon Street Road. (A couple of years earlier, he had rescued three orphan apprentices, whose master, a shoemaker in Rosemary Lane [now Royal Mint Street] had become bankrupt - no doubt this was part of his inspiration). Reed was adept at obtaining patrons (the Duke of Kent attended the inaugural dinner), and larger sites followed, first in Hackney Road for boys and Bethnal Green for girls, then at Clapton, then (following the cholera epidemic) at Watford, and now Reed's School in Cobham. He also founded an Infant Orphan Asylum, later called the Royal Wanstead School in 1827; the Asylum for Fatherless Children, later established in Purley and called Reedham School in 1844; the Asylum for Idiots, later the Royal Earlswood Hospital, Redhill in 1847; and the Royal Hospital for Incurables, now in Putney, in 1854. Although he was aware that providing Anglican instruction (particularly the Catechism) would attract greater patronage, he fought - not always successfully - for his institutions to be non-denominational. He and his wife Elizabeth were hymn-writers; his hymn Spirit divine, attend our prayers still features in some hymnals. In 1834 he visited the United States, and Yale University made him a Doctor of Divinity. Controversy surrounding his novel No Fiction: A Narrative Founded on Recent and Interesting Facts (1819) Controversy surrounded Reed's religious novel No Fiction: A Narrative Founded on Recent and Interesting Facts (1819; in print for many years; over 20 editions). Its characters were said to have been based on members of the congregation as well as Reed himself. Francis Barnett (Lef√®vre in the book), who was unstable, entered into bitter exchanges, including The Hero of No Fiction, or, Memoirs of Francis Barnett, with letters and authentic documents (1823) and spent some time in an asylum as a result. In November 1820 Reed published The Pastor's Acknowledgment - A Sermon occasioned by the occurrence of the 9th Anniversary of the Ordination.He provided his own epitaph:- > \\"I was born yesterday, I shall die tomorrow, And I must not spend today in > telling what I have done, But in doing what I may for HIM who has done all > for me. I sprang from the people, I have lived for the people ‚Äì The most for > the most unhappy; and the people when They know it will not suffer me to die > out of loving remembrance.\\"'' Isaac Kaliski and the Philpot Street Great Synagogue scandal In 1908 the chapel became the Philpot Street Great Synagogue whose secretary was Isaac Kaliski, later known as Isaac Kaye. He was also the Secretary of the Reliance Deposit & Loan Company, which was voluntarily wound up in 1920 with chairman Abraham Moses and Kaliski as liquidators. The site is now occupied by buildings of the Royal London Hospital. Kaliski was a tailor by trade, and was involved with several local synagogues, serving as Secretary both of Old Castle Street and Princelet Street synagogues, and of the Chevra Tehillim u'mishmorim (Society for Chanting the Psalms and Visiting the Sick) at the latter - the first of a number of similar societies. He also became Secretary of Philpot Street Great Synagogue, In 1923 Kaliski, giving the synagogue as his address, was convicted of what the magistrate described as one of the worst cases of fraud he had seen. Kaye died in 1933 at Finchley Road, Golders Green The Isaac Kalisky Kaye charity for the Jewish Poor, income to be distributed among the deserving poor of Southend and Westcliffe, was closed in 2001.

It was produced in association with Lorimar Productions (1986), Lorimar- Telepictures (1986‚Äì1988), and Lorimar Television (1988‚Äì1991). Originally starring Valerie Harper in the titular role as a mother trying to juggle her career with raising three sons with an absent airline pilot husband, Harper's character was killed off in the series after its second season, when Harper was fired from the series following contractual disputes. The series was initially renamed Valerie's Family before Sandy Duncan joined the cast as Valerie's sister-in-law and the boys' aunt, and the series was ultimately renamed The Hogan Family.

She contended with the regular uproar caused by girl- crazy and sometimes narcissistic 16-year-old David (Jason Bateman) and his 12-year-old fraternal twin brothers, irresponsible and jockish Willie (Danny Ponce), and brainy Mark (Jeremy Licht)‚Äîwhose spotless academic and behavioral record at school came to be pierced by occasional bursts of rebellion. Valerie worked as the buyer for an auction house and was matched in wit and charm by her best friend, Barbara Goodwin (Christine Ebersole). The family dog, Murray, died in a season-one story line; although the plot of the episode (\\"Dog Day Afternoon\\") mentions that Murray was 17 years old and already in mediocre health, his death is the result of injuries he suffered from a fall from a storm-downed tree in the Hogans' backyard. In season two, Harper and producer/husband Tony Cacciotti had increasing creative control over the show, and the candy-coated tinges of storytelling were completely replaced by realistic humor. Barbara was written out of the show, and the close friend/cohort role became occupied by neighbor Annie Steck (Judith Kahan), mother of a teenage daughter Rebecca (played in one episode by Paula Hoffman). Another neighbor, busybody Patty Poole (Edie McClurg), began appearing occasionally, as did David's friend Rich (Tom Hodges). A jock with a big-man- on-campus attitude, Rich was especially known for calling David \\"Hogie\\" (or \\"Hoagie\\"). Valerie had switched careers, now working as a freelance graphic artist, so she could be more available to her sons. Like most American sitcoms in the 1980s, the series sometimes dealt with moral conflicts, but not in a heavy-handed fashion. In the very special episode \\"Bad Timing\\", which first aired February 7, 1987, David and a former girlfriend debate whether to have sex. The episode featured the first use of the word condom on a prime time television program. Parental advisory warnings were issued in ads for the episode and NBC placed an advisory warning before the episode aired stating that parents may want to watch the episode with their children. Because of the episode's subject matter, some of NBC's affiliates either aired the show outside of prime time or refused to air it at all. The episode was later released to home video, especially for teachers and health educators to use as a tool to promote safe sex. Season 2: Harper leaves After a modest start in the ratings that was countered by critical success, Valerie had begun to show growth in the Nielsens by the end of the 1986‚Äì87 season. Its most significant ratings jump occurred after its moving to Mondays at 8:30/7:30c in March 1987, following ALF. NBC renewed the series for a third season in May. In light of the show's success, Harper and Cacciotti approached their producers and NBC about per-episode salary increases and a larger cut of future syndication revenue. When all of the couple's requests were refused, Harper and Cacciotti walked out on Valerie. Harper had prior history in this situation, as she staged a walk out in 1975 following the first season of her hit series Rhoda, which successfully resulted in a pay increase. The couple continued to negotiate with Miller-Boyett Productions, Lorimar-Telepictures and NBC during the next few months as the behind-the-scenes struggle became well publicized. NBC programming chief Brandon Tartikoff, who was unhappy with the feud, publicly stated that he would replace Harper with another actress if the fighting did not cease. Tartikoff suggested Sandy Duncan as a replacement to Miller and Boyett, who both sided with the network chief in this possible casting decision. Duncan had recently signed a contract with NBC for a starring vehicle, and Tartikoff felt that this would be the best opportunity for her to make use of it. The announcement was unprecedented at the time. There was never a show that had a lead actor or actress fired from a show named after him or her, with the series continuing with a different star. Harper and Cacciotti felt Tartikoff was trying to spite them with this attempt of a threat and criticized his notion that marquee stars of a television series were dispensable. In late July 1987, it appeared that a suitable new payment agreement was reached by all parties involved. Harper returned to shoot the third-season premiere in early August. However, shortly after the episode was completed, news had come that Harper and Cacciotti were holding out again. As a result, the cast shot scenes around Harper for the next few episodes. After the couple failed to be on the set for three consecutive episodes, Lorimar decided they had had enough, and fired Harper. The Valerie Hogan character was written out of the show by having the character die in a car accident. NBC explained that the series would take on difficult conflicts facing the family during the grieving process. To make good on their promise, Miller-Boyett and Tartikoff brought in Sandy Duncan as the series' new lead. The third-season premiere was hastily rewritten and shot to feature the shocking change in the storyline. Harper took both NBC and Lorimar to court for breach of contract. Both in the press and in court, Miller and Boyett made claims that Harper became difficult to work with, citing combativeness towards much of the staff and breakdowns of sorts, suggesting that salary demands were just surface issues with the actress. The producers insisted that Harper approached them on one occasion and exclaimed that the series was \\"being taken away\\" from her, since the show was putting slightly more emphasis on Jason Bateman's character of David Hogan at that time. (The producers admittedly wanted to capitalize on the heartthrob status Bateman had been receiving for the last few years, via his roles on Silver Spoons and It's Your Move.) Miller and Boyett also claimed that Harper and Cacciotti were displeased over the possibility that writing would shift to the more slapstick stories that had been a secondary component of their sitcoms at Paramount. Harper and Cacciotti denied these episodes of behavior and accused Miller and Boyett of lying, resulting in a counter libel suit against Harper. Though the NBC case was dismissed, Harper and Cacciotti won their trial against Lorimar on September 16, 1988, and were awarded a grand total of $1.82 million in damages which they both later donated to various charities. Valerie's Family When the 1987‚Äì88 season premiere aired, the show was retitled Valerie's Family. The timeline of the third season began six months after Valerie's character's death in an auto accident. NBC's decision to continue the series without Valerie Harper was controversial at the time, but the series survived the departure of its main star and the show continued its run on the network for three more seasons. Taking Harper's place in the household was Sandy Duncan as Michael's sister, Sandy, who had moved in with her brother to help the family in their time of loss. She took a job as a guidance counselor at the high school the boys attended following her recent divorce. In the wake of his wife's death, Michael was now home more often. Mrs. Poole moved up to being a regular character, and her husband, Peter, was played by Willard Scott on an infrequent basis. Another of David's buddies, Burt Weems (Steve Witting), joined this season (he had previously made guest shots during the last few Valerie episodes). The season's third episode, \\"Burned Out\\" (aired October 5, 1987), helped better explain the family's grief following the death of Valerie's character. In that episode, a lamp stored in the attic develops a short circuit, sparking a fire that badly damages the house. Many keepsakes and mementos are destroyed in the attic and second floor, including a charred framed photo of Valerie. David finds the photo in his room while the fire damage was being inspected, and immediately breaks down in tears. Sandy comes into the room to comfort him, and as the scene changes, it is presumed that the two share their grief for Valerie. The Hogans, meanwhile, stay with the Pooles while their home is repaired. The episode had a commercial tie-in with McDonald's, which financed the expenses accrued in damaging the set for the fire. As a sponsor that evening, McDonald's commercials aired promoting fire safety. The Hogan Family The cast of The Hogan Family with the inclusion of Sandy Duncan At the end of the third season, as Harper's lawsuit hearings continued, the network dropped Valerie's name from the title completely. This was partially to avoid further legal actions involved in continuing to use the original star's name, and also to move on from the public attention being drawn to her dismissal. In June 1988, during summer reruns of the third season, the show was retitled The Hogan Family. In the fall of 1988, David went off to Northwestern University, and his escapades with Rich and Burt became a major focus (Hodges and Witting now appeared in the opening credits). At one point during freshman year, David began to feel the strain of Mike's household curfew rules, which he felt should not have applied to him any longer since he was now over 18 and in college, and with the family's blessing, moved into Rich and Burt's tiny apartment near campus. The three had a hard time coexisting, so before long David voluntarily moved back home and came to a compromise with Mike who agreed to relax some of the rules with him acknowledging that he was no longer a child but a young adult. Willie and Mark entered high school that year, where they encountered a more fueled sibling rivalry due to their different identities. Sandy's ex-husband Richard made a few guest appearances, as played by Steve Vinovich. Mike's former Air Force colonel and flight trainer, Skip Franklin (Gerald Gordon) was another guest star, continuing his repeat appearances in this stage of the series, having originated the role on the third episode of Valerie in 1986. During Duncan's tenure with the show, no mention was ever made of Mike and Sandy's other sister, Caroline, who was played in the Valerie pilot by Francine Tacker. In her only guest appearance, Caroline was portrayed as being glamorous and just as successful as her airline pilot brother, although it was not explained as to what she did, or if she had a family of her own. As season five opened, the Hogans and Pooles, along with Burt and Rich, took an excursion to Paris. There, David met and fell in love with a woman who, unbeknownst to him, was a princess. When the two are seen around the city, government agents believe that the princess has been kidnapped, and target David, causing him and everyone else to be on the lam from them. While the rest of the family returned to Oak Park, Rich stayed abroad to explore more of Europe, and was no longer with the cast. Later that season, in early 1990, Mark began dating a girl named Cara (Josie Bissett), while Willie began to date Brenda (Angela Lee). That March, after a showdown with Principal Edwards (guest star Jon Cypher), which led to a nasty mailed resignation letter she started to regret, Sandy found herself promoted to vice principal. Network switch In 1990, after spending three of the last four years on Monday nights at 8:30/7:30 (having been on Sundays before that), NBC opted not to respond to an agreement made with Lorimar insisting that the network had to exercise renewal options on the series before April 1. Despite the series still sporting decent ratings, NBC stated that it chose not to renew The Hogan Family \\"because of the strength of our current development.\\" Lorimar Television subsequently signed a deal with CBS that moved The Hogan Family to the latter network beginning that fall. Mysteriously, CBS placed the series on Saturday nights at 8:30/7:30c, with a new Miller/Boyett sitcom, The Family Man, as its lead-in. At the start of The Hogan Family's sixth and final season, John Hillerman joined the cast as Sandy and Michael's father, Lloyd. The season premiere has Mike, Sandy, and the boys visit Lloyd in California, upon hearing that he and his wife (Mike and Sandy's mother) have just been divorced. Lloyd clearly has trouble with the events, and at one point in the hour-long episode goes missing, with the family fearing that he might have been killed boating during a storm. The senior Hogan materializes safe, and in the end, follows the family to Oak Park. During the same season, Cara and Brenda become full-time regulars, as Mark's and Willie's love interests. Also that fall, the twins lose their job at Bossy Burger after Willie pressures Mark to skip work with him in order to see a concert (Sandy and Mrs. Poole filled in for them that evening, impromptu). Eventually, in the episode \\"A Sneaking Suspicion\\" (aired July 10, 1991), Mark and Willie get new jobs at a shoe store in the local mall. Early in the season, Sandy Duncan was reunited with Valorie Armstrong, her former costar on Funny Face. Armstrong made a guest appearance as Mrs. Gordon in the episode \\"The Baby Stops Here\\" (September 29, 1990). =Rich returns from Europe= In the December 1, 1990, episode, \\"Best of Friends, Worst of Times\\", Tom Hodges reprised the role of Rich after over a year's absence from the show. The main plot begins with David and Burt shooting a video project for one of their college classes, at the local hospital in Oak Park. In the midst of their work with various patients on-camera, Rich shows up in the waiting room greeting an older man (guest star Al Fann), when David and Burt discover him. Rich is happy to see them, but his expressions also indicate nervousness and a rush to avoid his friends. David says that Burt and he had been trying to get in touch with him for months, and Rich explains that he had stayed over in Europe for an extended time, alluding to the fact that he had met a woman while there. After the three initially reunite, the older man with whom Rich was first seen talking tells David that he can find Rich in the wing \\"with all the other AIDS patients\\". In a combination of shock and fear due to his confused knowledge of the disease as he had preconceived notions that the illness only affected gay men and drug addicts, David struggles to come to terms with Rich having AIDS. He avoids the situation until Sandy comes forward and reveals to David that an old college friend of hers died of AIDS several years earlier. David, Burt, and the rest rally around Rich, who at first wanted little to no attention, but soon opened up, and try to make the most of the time they had with him. As the episode concludes, the timeline advances three months, with Sandy and David speaking at the high school's assembly about HIV and AIDS. David touches upon his experiences with Rich, dispels common myths associated with the disease and how to prevent it, and breaks the news of Rich's passing, which had occurred the night before. The decision to bring such closure to the character of Rich was partially made by the actor who portrayed him, as Hodges co-wrote the episode. =Cancellation= That December, due to dismal Saturday night ratings, CBS dropped the show from its weekly schedule. The series did not return until eight months later, in July 1991, when it finally aired the remaining episodes left for the season. In the interim, CBS announced they had not renewed the show for a seventh season, and would burn off the leftover episodes twice a week in July. Four unaired episodes had been produced before it was put on hiatus. During the hiatus, production was shut down. The Hogan Family was not given the chance to end with a proper finale. When the leftover episodes aired, they were scheduled on Wednesday nights for two consecutive weeks, July 10 and 17, 1991, before the last two episodes of the series aired in an hour-long block on Saturday, July 20, 1991. The 1990 Christmas show (which had not made it to air the previous December) was the final original episode of The Hogan Family produced, and the last network broadcast of the show, that aired at 8:30/7:30 on Saturday, July 20. Production After a long run at Paramount Television, which concluded with the end of Happy Days in 1984, producers Tom Miller and Bob Boyett moved to a new home at Lorimar Productions, a partnership between the two and the studio which commenced on October 1 of that year. Miller and Boyett had ideas about venturing into hour- long comedy/dramas with Lorimar, at a time where a decline in the popularity of half-hour situation comedies was perceived. However, by the time they began at Lorimar, NBC had struck ratings gold with The Cosby Show, and sitcoms were in vogue once again. The pair, who were launching their new Miller-Boyett Productions nameplate sans longtime partner Eddie Milkis, re-shifted their focus to sitcoms. For their first Lorimar project, Miller-Boyett had Valerie Harper in mind for a starring vehicle. Harper quickly struck a deal with the producers and announced her return to series television, the first time since the conclusion of Rhoda in December 1978. Developed during the 1984‚Äì85 season and picked up by NBC, the series was known from conception as Close to Home. It had the same format as what made it to the air, that of a modern mother juggling many responsibilities while her husband was often away. For the latter role in particular, NBC still wanted someone with visual and personal appeal despite the limited scenes, and tapped Days of Our Lives star Josh Taylor to play Harper's airline pilot husband. Taylor's part-time status on the sitcom enabled him to continue his role as Chris Kositchek on Days. Additionally, teen star Jason Bateman, suddenly available after the cancellation of his NBC series It's Your Move, and Danny Ponce, who had been playing Jason Avery on Lorimar's Knots Landing for the previous two seasons, were added as two of Harper's kids. Newcomer Jeremy Licht rounded out the brood. Broadway actress Christine Ebersole was cast as Harper's best friend, a strong enough presence that the star could play off. The series was to feature a more genuine sense of realism, which Miller and Boyett had in mind for their dramedy concepts. However, this was combined with the smart, character-driven humor that Harper was aiming for, as she and then-boyfriend (later husband) Tony Cacciotti were given ample creative control on her new series. The pilot for Close to Home was shot in the summer of 1985, and aside from a few changes called for during testing, was given the green light by NBC for a backup premiere that fall (to immediately replace a new September half-hour entry that could have failed). Subsequent episodes were slated to shoot when Jeremy Licht came down with chickenpox, derailing the shooting and ultimately, the premiere. This gave the creative team extra time to tweak the format, and when Licht was well again, production resumed with changes NBC approved of. As the initial season of episodes progressed shooting, NBC retitled the series Valerie, which it debuted as on March 1, 1986. Valerie was the first series Miller and Boyett produced without the aid of Eddie Milkis. The show was produced by Miller-Boyett Productions and Tal Productions, Inc. in association with Lorimar Television (as Lorimar Productions for season 1 and Lorimar- Telepictures for season 2). Producers The executive producers (besides Miller and Boyett) were Tony Cacciotti (Valerie Harper's husband since 1987), series creator Charlie Hauck (for the pilot episode only) and Out of the Blue producer Irma Kalish, who helmed the final season. Rich Correll served as co- producer for the first two seasons and later became consulting producer. Directors Directing credits included James Burrows, Peter Baldwin, Howard Storm, and beginning in 1988, Jason Bateman, who was the youngest-ever director to be registered into the Directors Guild of America (at age 18). Jason's father Kent Bateman also directed some episodes. Theme music and presentation The theme song, \\"Together Through the Years,\\" was performed by Roberta Flack and composed by Charles Fox. The lyrics were written by Stephen Geyer. Fox, a holdover from Miller and Boyett's Paramount years, was the principal score composer for the first two seasons, with Bruce Miller taking over from seasons three through six. This was the only Miller/Boyett series from the Lorimar/Warner Bros. era to have not used the songwriting, composing, and underscoring talents of Jesse Frederick and Bennett Salvay for most of its run. Frederick and Salvay, however, did score selected episodes of the series: the first in November 1986, another in April 1987 (which they co-scored with Steven Chesne), and a third in the spring of 1988. Conversely, Valerie was the only Miller/Boyett series to have featured scoring by Fox during the producers' Lorimar era. The series utilized four different credit fonts during its six seasons. Originally, the principal typeface for all credits was in orange, black-embossed, italicized Bookman Old Style font. Its usage ceased when the second season of Valerie went into production; it later showed up on three more Lorimar programs: the 1989 NBC sitcom Nearly Departed, and ABC's Family Matters and Getting By (the latter two of which were direct sister shows to Valerie, as they were Miller/Boyett series). During the second season of Valerie, the font used in the title sequence and first and final scenes was a gold, condensed version of Cooper Black font. Second season closing credits were in a Windsor font (also seen on All in the Family and Who's the Boss?). Seasons three through six switched to the traditional Cooper Black font, now set in yellow and used in all credits. As was the case with Perfect Strangers, the first season did not use the familiar Miller/Boyett Productions logo set in Century 751 type; the \\"Miller/Boyett Productions\\" byline appeared in the show's main font instead. The proper logo made its debut in the second season, with the main byline accompanied on the side by a larger \\"M/B\\" in the same font. Near the end of season two, the byline dispensed the \\"M/B\\", and it continued to appear without it for the rest of the series. (The full version of the Miller/Boyett logo, with the \\"M/B\\", would reappear as a stand-alone vanity plate on their shows from 1996 to 1998.)  Syndication  The Hogan Family aired in U.S. syndication on local television stations, from September 1990 until Summer 1998. From August 1998 until August 1999, startup broadcast network PAX TV aired reruns of the series weekdays at 4/3c. ABC Family previously held the U.S. syndication rights to the program and had aired episodes twice daily for five weeks from September 25 until October 27, 2006. It had discontinued running the show since then. In Canada, the Crossroads Television System held the Canadian syndication rights and began airing the show Wednesday nights. It discontinued airing the show in 2011. The Hogan Family title was used for syndicated showings of almost all episodes, including those originally broadcast as Valerie or Valerie's Family. Also, the theme was shortened in the opening credits when the show was in syndication. During the Valerie seasons, the title sequence becomes slow motion at the scene where Mike and the boys begin to tackle Valerie in their football game. For the third-season episodes, the title shot from seasons four and five is used for reruns, where The Hogan Family is displayed over the Hogans carrying their picnic items through the park. This deleted the scene where Sandy runs out to the baseball diamond to try and get the bases unloaded. The latter was where the Valerie's Family title was shown on NBC airings, with The Hogans appearing over the park-walking scene. The only episode to retain the Valerie title in syndication was \\"Bad Timing\\" (February 8, 1987), which also kept the original parental advisory disclaimer from NBC. In 2016, Antenna TV announced that they would air the series in 2017. The Christmas episode was the first to air on the network on December 16, during a marathon of holiday-themed episodes from Antenna TV programs throughout the month, before the show officially joined the lineup on January 2, 2018. In the United Kingdom the series was shown on BBC1 from 1987 to 1992.

The dark and sticky dish consists mainly of kithul jaggery (from the sap of the toddy palm), rice flour and coconut milk. Kalu dodol is a very difficult and time-consuming dish to prepare. The Hambanthota area is famous for the production of this dish. Origins and history Kalu dodol is believed to have been introduced to Sri Lanka by Malay migrants, perhaps from Indonesia. It has also been attributed to the Portuguese, who occupied parts of the country during the 16th and 17th centuries. With the introduction of artificial ingredients in recent times, the preparation of kalu dodol has occasionally deviated from the traditional recipes. Kalu dodol, along with other traditional sweets, is commonly prepared and consumed in celebration of the Sinhala New Year. As the process of making the dish is difficult and time- consuming, nowadays most people don't make kalu dodol themselves, instead preferring to buy it from shops. Kalu dodol capital The Hambanthota area in southern Sri Lanka is famous for kalu dodol, and is sometimes referred to as the kalu dodol capital. The kalu dodol industry is a major source of income for many people in the area. The kalu dodol shops in Hambanthota are frequently visited by pilgrims coming to visit the nearby holy town of Kataragama. In 2011, the Sri Lankan government allocated Rs. 134 million for setting up kalu dodol sales centres in the Hambanthota area, in an effort to develop the industry. Description The main ingredients of kalu dodol are kithul jaggery (from the treacle of the Caryota urens plant), rice flour and coconut milk. Other ingredients such as cashews, cardamom and raisins may be added. It is dark brown in colour and is a thick, sticky and sweet jelly-like dish with a \\"slightly granulated\\" texture. To make the dish, the kithul jaggery and thin coconut milk is mixed and boiled in a large pan until the mixture is reduced to half the original amount. The rice flour, thick coconut milk and the rest of the ingredients are then added. It is necessary to continuously stir the mixture while simmering, to prevent it from burning and sticking to the pan. The oil that floats to the surface of the mixture must also be repeatedly removed. Once the mixture becomes thick, it is poured into a tray, pressed, and left to cool. This labour-intensive process can take up to nine hours. The firm kalu dodol is cut into pieces before serving.

The Kolormondo system is used to understand, identify and communicate colours. Kolormondo is a patent pending Swedish innovation. The founder of Kolormondo, Nicoline Kinch, has received the Inventors Prize of the city of Stockholm.  Colours in 3D  Kolormondo is displayed as a 3D Colour Puzzle and as a digital 3D Colour Globe. The Kolormondo 3D Colour Puzzle is based on CMYK, Cyan (C), Magenta (M), Yellow (Y) and on Black (K). These are pigment based colours, which are used on printed media. Kolormondo's digital colour globe is built with RGB, Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B). These are light colours and are used on the screen. The Kolormondo system is three- dimensional displayed as a globe. At the Equator, you find the most pure hues, those that constitute the colour circle. The North Pole is white while the South Pole is black. The closer you get to the white North Pole the lighter the colours become. If you go south towards the black South Pole the colours get darker. Towards the globe's core, colours gradually turn grey. A pillar or a column between the North and the South Pole is the grey scale. Kolormondo invites you to systematically navigate between colours and explore how they blend into each other. The gradual change from any given colour in/out to its less/more saturated ‚Äúrelative‚Äù colour is clear as well as the change in value going up for a lighter version or down for a more black. You can see how apricot turns into orange, transforms into brown when following colours along the sphere's longitude; while the same brown turned into purple in one direction along the latitude, and into dark green going the other way.

The film is meant to be \\"mass entertainment\\", in the words of Guan, who also co-wrote the screenplay. The film is set in 1942, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Much of the plotFelly, Derek. Film review in Film Business Asia (retrieved on 23 July 2013)‚ôô revolves around the fates of two Japanese scientists who are captured in Beiping (Beijing) by the three title characters, who have trouble deciding what to do with them. Plot The film is set in China in the 1940s during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Imperial Japanese Army's Unit 731 conducts experiments on biological weapons by releasing cholera in Beiping, but that inadvertently hinders their advance because their troops are at risk of being infected as well. They block off all access to the city and secretly summon two scientists to handle the situation. The virus spreads outside the city while the people inside the city suffer from hunger. A scoundrel encounters the two scientists inside Beiping, without knowing who they are, and attempts to rob them. After a short chase through the streets, the scoundrel captures them and brings them to a Japanese restaurant owned by a Chinese chef. An opera actor also lives in the restaurant. The three men are unable to decide what to do with the scientists. The chef wants to release the captives because he is afraid of getting into trouble. The scoundrel wants to get out of the difficult situation so he lies that he is from the Chinese Eighth Route Army. The actor wants to kill the scientists and the scoundrel, because he feels that they would offend the Chinese army if they release the scientists and they would offend the Japanese military if they release the scoundrel. Just when the three men brandish their weapons at each other and are locked in a stalemate, the chef's wife rummages through the scientists' belongings, finds a canister of cholera, and realises that the scientists are actually sent by Unit 731 to deal with the virus. At this point, the three men come to terms with each other and agree to cooperate and share the gains from selling the canister of cholera. The scoundrel and actor use various methods to interrogate the scientists and gather more information. The chef, who serves as their translator, secretly helps the two scientists.

He then joined Melbourne where he worked as a recruiter, before becoming chief executive in 1997 under the presidency of Joseph Gutnick. He resigned in 1999 after a disagreement with Gutnick following a major salary cap breach. In 2001 he joined Fremantle as chief executive officer, after the club had experienced their worst ever season, sacking their coach mid-year and winning only two games for the year. He remained there for seven years, vastly improving the club's finances. Schwab returned to Melbourne, and in 2008 he was persuaded by club president Jim Stynes to return as chief executive officer. Whilst the club performed well off the field, the club's on-field performances remained poor and the club was investigated for tanking.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, who represented the riding of Port Arthur from 1967 to 1971. He was elected as a Liberal in 1967 but in 1969 he announced that he was quitting the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent. Background Knight was born in Windsor, Ontario in 1932. Knight was a radio and television broadcaster. His first radio broadcasting job was with Ottawa's largest radio station, CFRA, in 1954. He then held positions at stations in Rouyn Noranda, Pembroke and Fort William (now Thunder Bay). In 1961, he was hired by CKPR-TV, in Fort William, to broadcast the evening news, and he held that position until 1967. Even while serving as an MPP, Knight held a part-time position with Toronto radio station CHUM. Politics Knight ran as the Liberal candidate in the 1967 provincial election. He defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent George Wardrope by 815 votes. He served as a member of the opposition behind leader Robert Nixon. In 1967 he gave his first speech as an MPP in Ojibway. Initially the speaker would not allow it but Premier Bill Davis supported Knight. On July 17, 1968 he complained that revenue from northern mining operations was not being reinvested in the north. Minister for Mines Allan Lawrence termed that complaint as \\"horse feathers\\". On the same day, Knight spoke in French in the legislature warning that a policy of bilingualism could give French speaking civil servants an unwarranted advantage. Five days later he voted for a motion to make the legislature bilingual because \\"he wanted to make it work\\". The motion passed unanimously. In October 1969, Knight stood in the house and announced that he was leaving the Liberal party and would sit as an independent. He said, \\"From this day forward I will sit as a free member speaking under the protection of no party, Liberal, Conservative, New Democrat... I have had a falling out with all the parties, more particularly with the party system, or should I say the 'petty system'.\\" Liberal leader Nixon was caught off guard by Knight's announcement. Nixon said, \\"I really didn't know what he was going to say. The allegations are all unfounded and I feel very badly that Ron felt he had to say them.\\" Port Arthur Liberal manager Rod Clarke said he was delighted by the announcement. Clarke said that Knight never really represented the riding and called him \\"unfit for office.\\" Later life After his defeat in the 1971 general election, Knight held positions at radio stations in Richmond Hill, Newmarket, and Barrie, finally retiring, in 1987, from CHAY-FM, in Barrie.

Foto: 1950. The Ljungstr√∂m yacht Vingen 10. Foto: 2010. Ljungstr√∂m sailboat is the name for the sailboats created by the Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m, whose interest sailing had been since childhood. The characteristics of an Ljungstr√∂m sailboat are circular arc hull and the Ljungstr√∂m rig where the mast is unsupported by rope and wire, rotatable on two ball bearings and often with double main sails but no fore sail. At their time the Ljungstr√∂m sailboats were a minor revolution as they were fast, safe and easy to sail as well as relatively easy and affordable to produce. The models were named The Wing and the number (Swedish Vingen 1, Vingen 2 etc.) chronologically. A few models were built in series, such as Vingen 11A and the Twin Wing which was specifically produced or the US market. The design was not appreciated by the fairly conservative yacht clubs at the time, so the development had to be done with scarce means. A fair guess is that approximately sixty boats of different sizes have been produced. Known to still exist are about eighteen, about a dozen sailing, the rest undergoing renovation or waiting for one.http://sites.google.com/site/ljungstromare  The Circular Arc Hull  The hull of the Ljungstr√∂m boats are designed according to the circular arc, with a negative top line to create minimal wind turbulence around the hull, support the unstayed mast and simplify the production. To avoid wet timber ends the boards are applied from the bottom up. This way the longest board goes from stern to stern while the shortest ones are almost parallel to the railing midships. The shape gave the boats the nickname The Arch Support, but is brilliant in many ways: \\\\- When sailing it is noticed that the volume counteracting swaying is midships and that the surface exposed to the wind at the sterns is minimised which makes manoeuvring at low speed easier in narrow and windy places. \\\\- The production is simplified as the ribs are all of the same shape and that the planks are made of parallel-surfaced bars.  Rigging and sails  The Ljungstr√∂m rig was constructed to improve safety on board. It facilitates reefing at such rapid weather changes and eliminates the risk of a hard boom in the head. In addition, walking on deck during sailing is completely unnecessary as everything is handled from the cockpit. This is normal for modern boats with all the trains routed to the cockpit, but was very ahead of its time in the 40s when the cases and similar ropes was fastened on the mast. The mast, which lacks shroud and bar, is hollow case and consists of glued wood with a hoisted (a planed or machined grooved) luff. The relatively coarse mast is supported by simple ball bearings at deck fitting and in the bottom. The sails are hoisted and hauled usually only once, in spring and autumn. During the season the sail(s) are wound up on the mast by this rotated by a crank in the cockpit which drives an endless rope on a collar attached to the lower part of the mast. Reefing is therefore simple. By rotating the mast slightly a better aerodynamic profile which avoids turbulence on the leeward side of the circular mast is created. At full run the two sails are hauled on each side so the sail area doubled. Rig design was patented 1938, see United States Patent 4367688 \\"Sailboat were having twin booms, DOUBLED sail and rotatable mast Permits Conventional sailing with bothering booms and sail sections on Sami thanks or with booms spread, wing and wing, to run before the wind or on a reach. Sail may be reefed or furled by rotating the mast. \\" Ljungstr√∂m also developed a solution to easily adjust the mast tilt (forward / backward) through a roll in the mast foot (April 1921). In this way, the mast relatively easily tilted fore and aft to adjust the boat's ltendency to luff depending on wind strength. The Ljungstr√∂m rig was easy to handle but got no more widespread among sailboat manufacturers as sailing at full and broad reach were less efficient than rigs with a jib and boom that provides a better air flow. Contemporary tests of Swedish, Norwegian and Swedish yacht club showed Ljungstr√∂m rig superior in full run and close reach, where it also gave higher altitude against the wind. The Royal Yacht Squadron in England equipped two boats of the type Redwing with Ljungstr√∂m rigs to match them against the conventional rigged Redwings. The races that could be completed showed an advantage to Ljungstr√∂m's rig.  Wharfs  * Company Nyk√∂ping Automobile Factory, founded in 1937 (and was merged with Saab Ana 1960) built 13 Ljungstr√∂m sailboats between 1934 and 1945. * Several boats, e.g. Vingen 10 and 12, were built in 1949 at Ljungstr√∂m's summer house in Fiskeb√§ckskil  Legacy  The boats became popular in North America. The Ljungstr√∂m rig has inspired among others: * Walt Scott designed Beachcomber. Built in 24 specimens of Marine Innovators of Clearwater, Florida * The Canadian Gordon Fisher, who along with designer Mark Ellis and George Hinterhoeller built almost a thousand Nonsuch 22 to 36 feet * Storb√•ten (\\"The Big Boat\\", nowadays called the Saaristo boat) open with centerboard and dual sails on two rotating masts. A structure that must be mentioned is that of Jac Iverssen designed Tesla. 13.8 m, completely roofed housing headroom and two lounges. Tesla was monouvred from ahead of the mast. Today (2010) Tesla is in need of renovation.

Personal life  He was born in Shagamu, Ogun, the first son of the local king. He came to the United Kingdom in 1939 to study at Queen's University of Belfast where he graduated in medicine in 1942.  Athletics career  He won the 1947 AAA Championships in Loughborough in the high jump with a clearance of 1.93 metres. Adedoyin featured in a 1947 newsreel by Path√© News focusing on university sports. In the footage, he is described as 'a good bet to represent Britain at the Olympic Games'. He went on to compete in the 1948 Summer Olympics, both in the high jump and the long jump. In the high jump, on 30 July, he qualified for the final, as one of 20 competitors who made it past the qualifying round, where a height of 1.87 metres was needed to qualify. The sheer number of competitors in the high jump meant that the event seemed endless. In the final he jumped 1.90 metres on his third attempt to come twelfth ‚Äì if he had cleared it on his first attempt he could have finished as high as sixth. A day later in the long jump, he qualified by virtue of placing in the top twelve in the qualifying round as less than twelve athletes reached the qualifying distance of 7.20 metres, with only five reaching it in the final. Adedoyin was one of these, placing fifth with a jump of 7.27 metres. His personal best jumps were 1.969 metres in the high jump (1949) and 7.35 metres in the long jump (1947).  Life after athletics  After the Olympics, he went back to Nigeria to practise as an obstetrician-gynaecologist. He died in January 2014.

Content Written in opposition to the Indian demands for self-rule and independence from British rule, the book pointed to the treatment of India's women, the untouchables, animals, dirt, and the character of its nationalistic politicians. A large part of the book dealt with the problems resulting from the marriage of young girls. This was considered to be one of the main causes that led to an uproar across India after many newspapers declaring it scurrilous libel against Hindus and Hinduism. Mayo singled out the allegedly rampant and fatally weakening sexuality of its males to be at the core of all problems, leading to masturbation, rape, homosexuality, prostitution, and venereal diseases. Reception Mayo's book created outrage across India, and it was burned along with her effigy. Mayo's book Mother India was criticized by Mahatma Gandhi as a \\"report of a drain inspector sent out with the one purpose of opening and examining the drains of the country to be reported upon\\". The book prompted over fifty angry books and pamphlets to be published to highlight Mayo's errors and false perception of Indian society, which had become a powerful influence on the American people's view of India. Critics of Mayo accuse her works of being racist, pro-imperialist and Indophobic tracts that \\"expressed all the dominant prejudices of colonial society.\\". Annie Besant called Mother India \\"a remarkably wicked book slandering the whole Indian people\\". The book has also been cited as an example of feminist rhetoric being appropriated for advancing western imperialism and racism. In 1929, Harry H. Field, whom she had thanked in the foreword of her book wrote a book called After Mother India in which he responded to the criticisms made of the book, added more commentaries and wrote a brief biography of Katherine Mayo. A chapter was dedicated to the most important critique, that of Gandhi. After its publication Dalip Singh Saund (later a congressman) wrote My Mother India (c. 1930) to counter Mayo's assertions. Another response to Mayo's book was Dhan Gopal Mukerji's A Son of Mother India Answers (1928).

With the name Mother Marie-Salom√© she was the first Superior General of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa (White Sisters). Early years Marie-Ren√©e Roudaut was born in Guiss√©ny, Brittany, France, on 3 March 1847 to a farming family. She was the sixth child of Ren√© Roudaut and Marie-Jeanne Lessec. Her cousin was one of the first nuns to go to Algeria to assist the Archbishop of Algeria, Charles Lavigerie, in running the diocesan orphanages. Her cousin could not complete her novitiate due to poor health, but returned to Brittany where she talked to Roudaut, who decided to join the congregation. Missionary In October 1871 Roudaut left for the Postulate of Vans, at the age of twenty four. On 26 January 1874 she arrived in Algeria where she was assigned to the orphanage of St Charles at Kouba, Algeria, now a suburb of Algiers. She received the habit on 23 June 1872 as Sister Marie-Salom√©, and made her first profession on 6 July 1873. On 23 January 1874 she was sent to the mission of St Cyprien of the Attafs, a village for orphans whom the church had raised to adulthood. She was recalled to St Charles in November 1877, and in March 1878 was sent to a new mission at Ouadhias, Kabylia. On 21 October 1879 she was elected Assistant General of the order. In 1880 she was appointed head of the novitiate. Superior General At the third General Chapter of the society, on 14 September 1882 Mother Marie-Salom√© was elected Superior General of the \\"S≈ìurs Enseignantes et Hospitali√®res de Notre Dame des Missions d‚ÄôAfrique\\". New rules were promulgated for the congregation, similar to those of the White Fathers. On 6 April 1885 Lavigerie, now a Cardinal, dissolved the congregation and relegated its members to the Attafs. He felt the sisters, many of whom were poorly educated, were not qualified for responsible missionary work. Other concerns were the lack of money, difficulty obtaining equipment, difficulties of recruitment and a scandal caused by the defection of one nun. Mother Salom√© managed to persuade Lavigerie to reverse his decision, and on 9 February 1886 the novitiate and Mother House were returned to St Charles. In September of that year she was unanimously reelected as Superior General of the congregation. During the summer of 1887 Mother Salom√© opened postulates at Lyon, France and Maastricht, the Netherlands. In November 1887 she transferred the novitiate and Mother House to Carthage, Tunisia. In 1888 Rome issued a Decree of praise of the Congregation of the \\"Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions of Africa\\", followed by approval of the society's constitution for five years. That year Mother Salom√© traveled in Europe, Algeria, Tunisia and Canada. In June 1890 the novitiate and Mother House returned to St Charles, Algiers. On 13 December 1893 the congregation was finally given autonomy under the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide. Rome decreed that the Superior General had full authority for government of the society. Under the leadership of Marie Salome the congregation provided a wide range of services to the people in Algeria including running dispensaries, training housewives and providing schools. The first Caravan to the Equator left of 12 June 1894, and the first Caravan to Sudan left on 23 October 1897. Throughout the years that followed Mother Salom√© continued to be reelected as Superior General. She ceased traveling due to poor health in 1917, and resigned on 28 June 1925. Mother Salom√© died at St Charles on 18 October 1930 at the age of 83.

The most intense of these systems have many of the characteristics of subtropical cyclones. They develop between 25Àö south and 40Àö south and within 5Àö of the Australian coastline, typically during the winter months, but may occur in autumn and spring as well. Each year there are about ten \\"significant impact\\" maritime lows. Prior to the introduction of satellite imagery in the early 1960s, many east coast lows were classified as tropical cyclones. These storms which mostly affect the south east coast should not be confused with Australian region tropical cyclones which typically affect the northern half of the continent. Characterisation Explosive cyclogenesis is seen on average just once per year, but these storms cause significant wind and flood damage when they occur. Australian east coast cyclones vary in size from mesoscale (approximately ) to synoptic scale (approximately ). Australian east coast cyclones, although variable in size and intensity, are typically characterised by widespread heavy rainfall. These storms usually occur along the subtropical east coast of Australia from Gladstone in Queensland to the Victoria/New South Wales border, and often affect large populated cities such as Sydney and Brisbane, between which over one-third of the Australian population resides. Rain associated damages attributed to east coast cyclones are estimated in millions to tens of million dollars annually and are a major contributor to the total weather-associated insurance losses for all of Australia. Seven per cent of all major Australian disasters since 1967 can be directly attributed to east coast cyclones. Australian east coast lows often intensify rapidly overnight making them one of the more dangerous weather systems to affect the New South Wales coast. Pattern The incidence of these types of storms can be seen to fluctuate quite widely from one year to the next, with none in some years and the highest incidence being twelve in 1978/79. Another feature of east coast low development is the tendency for clustering of events when conditions remain favourable. For example, near Brisbane, almost one third of events occur within 20 days of a preceding event. Correlations of east coast cyclones with the interannual differences of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) indicate a strong preference for these storms to form just after a large swing from negative to positive Southern Oscillation index values and especially between swings from negative SOI the year before and positive SOI the year after. This suggests a preference for formation of east coast cyclones between extreme events of the Southern Oscillation Index.

Additionally, the organization has country offices in Cambodia, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Uganda, United States, and Zimbabwe. Origins of the Rural Reconstruction Movement Y.C. James Yen (right) at the White House next to Chinese Ambassador Alfred Sao-ke Sze (left). The origins of the movement can be traced back to China in the 1930s, during the Great Depression in China. Individuals living in rural China, many of them landless, were particularly hurt by the global economic downturn. The declining agricultural and rural economy caused severe social unrest in the countryside. Intellectuals and reformers such as Liang Shuming, Y.C. James Yen, Tao Xingzhi, Lu Zuofu and Peng Yuting turned their attention to the countryside and initiated the first wave of the Rural Reconstruction movement in order to experiment with various rural development models. Liang Shuming and James Yen were prominent figures in the movement. Liang Shuming emphasized the merger of traditional Chinese beliefs and values with new agricultural and technological advances. He funded the Research Institute of Rural Reconstruction in Zouping county of Shandong province to disseminate his theories of development. The organization trained thousands of rural educators in remote and previously under-served rural communities. It also helped to introduce new agricultural technology and hybridized plants to these communities. James Yen, unlike Liang, received a western education at Hong Kong and later Yale University and worked for a time in France. He believed that education was the primary tool in empowering the poor. He therefore supported educational reforms in the Chinese countryside, where most people lived. Yen summarized China's rural problems as peasants' ignorance, poverty, illness and selfishness. The remedy to these problems thus relied on mass education with respect to culture, livelihood, health care and civic mindedness. Yen and his colleagues committed to reduce the illiteracy rate in the countryside and teach farmers science and new technologies. They also edited and published a farmers' newspaper and established a farmers' radio and performance group to promote local literature, art and theater. Both Liang and Yen's projects were halted by the Sino-Japanese War of 1937. Yen would take his educational movement abroad to other developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In 1960 Yen founded the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction in the Philippines. The Yen Center The Yen Center ‚Äînamed after IIRR's founder, Dr. Y.C. James Yen‚Äî is an eco-friendly training facility situated approximately from Manila in the Province of Cavite, Philippines. The campus is nestled in a wide range of fauna and flora and is the home of the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction. The facility offers seminars, training, retreats, workshops, conferences, team building, and other learning events. Accommodation The Yen Center offers low carbon accommodations in a rural setting with green landscapes designed to cater to group-specific requirements. Furnished bungalow-type cottages with green sustainable operating practices are also available for family and small group events. Facilities and Services The Yen Center has three fully equipped function halls and several break-out rooms and reflection huts. The Yen Center also offers an array of dishes from international menus to local favorites and own recipes are even produced using campus garden produce. Eco-friendly Environment The campus-style environment is well suited for outdoor activities such as camping, bird-watching and nature trekking. Other sites on the campus include learning centers that focus on IIRR's work and projects. Livelihood Learning Sites The Sustainable Livelihood Demo Sites focuses on agro-forestry and features an integrated farm replete with a fodder garden, composting sites, and various livelihood options such an indigenous swine and poultry productions. The George Sycip Bio-Intensive Garden (BIG) Learning Center, a demonstration center growing of indigenous vegetables and other planting materials, displays IIRR's climate-smart agro- ecological practices. Other Livelihood Learning Sites include the Youth Development Program Learning Center, the International School for Sustainable Tourism and the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement Farm. https://iirr.org/yen-center/?tab=et_pb_tab_0 Bio-Intensive Gardening (BIG) BIG programs have been particularly useful in urban areas where traditional agricultural methods are untenable. Bio-intensive urban gardens, in addition to the emphasis on enhanced nutritional quality of the food produced, adds a concern with food safety, given the increasing commercialization of vegetables from high input peri-urban and truck farming systems. Bio-Intensive Gardening (BIG) was first developed in 1984 in response to a collapse of the Philippine sugar industry and a subsequent economic crisis. By 1986 the rate of malnutrition in the province of Negros Occidental, where BIG was first implemented, had fallen from 25% to 40%. BIG and similar programs can be found in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos, Nepal and Thailand. Bio-Intensive Gardens provide organic nutritious food as well as a source of income for the individuals that cultivate them. In the Philippine city of Cagayan de Oro, 25% of produce cultivated with BIG techniques are eaten by the cultivator and their family. The remaining 75% is sold to neighbors and walk-in clients. 75% of cultivators double their vegetable consumption in a city where vegetable intake intake is only 36kg per capita per year, half of the FAO recommended minimum.

City of New York, et al. (case citation of 959 F. Supp. 2d 540 (2013)) is a set of cases addressing the class action lawsuit filed against the City of New York, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and named and unnamed New York City police officers (\\"Defendants\\"), alleging that defendants have implemented and sanctioned a policy, practice, and/or custom of unconstitutional stops and frisks by the New York Police Department (\\"NYPD\\") on the basis of race and/or national origin, in violation of Section 1983 of title forty-two of the United States Code, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Constitution and laws of the State of New York. Facts Although this case is a class action suit filed on behalf of the minority civilians of the city of New York, David Floyd and David Ourlicht specifically alleged that the NYPD had employed \\"stop and frisk\\" on them without reasonable suspicion. Floyd, an African-American man, claimed that on February 27, 2008, he was walking on the path adjacent to his house in the Bronx, New York. He encountered the basement tenant, also an African-American man, who indicated that he was locked out of his apartment and asked for help because Floyd's godmother owned the building. Floyd then went upstairs to retrieve the key and he retrieved seven to ten keys because he was unsure of the correct key for the basement lock. Floyd and the tenant went to the basement apartment door and started trying the various keys. After trying five or six keys, they found the correct one. However, before they could open the door, three NYPD officers approached them and asked the two men what they were doing, told them to stop, and proceeded to frisk them. The officers asked the men to produce identification and interrogated the two men as to whether they lived there and what they were doing. The officers claimed they had stopped Floyd because they believed Floyd was in the middle of committing a burglary. The officers maintained that Floyd's behavior was suspicious and there had been a burglary pattern for that time of day in the neighborhood. The officers recorded Floyd's stop and frisk on a UF250 form, indicating that the suspected crime was burglary. In response to the question \\"Was Person Searched?,\\" the officers checked \\"No.\\" The three officers also claimed that they were unaware of any quotas or expectations that they complete a certain number of stops or UF250s per tour or per month. David Ourlicht, who is of African-American and Italian ancestry, testified that around 10 a.m. on the morning of either June 6 or June 9, 2008, he was sitting on a bench with an African-American male friend, outside the Johnson public housing complex in Harlem, New York. After sitting on the bench for about ten minutes, Ourlicht noticed two male uniformed police officers walking through the housing complex. When the two officers reached the corner, they turned, drew their weapons and screamed \\" ‚ÄòGet on the floor, get on the floor!‚Äô and ‚ÄòThere's a gun around here. Everybody get on the floor!‚Äô \\" At the same time, a blue and white police van arrived and three or four officers exited the van. All of the police officers were running and had their guns out. The officers told Ourlicht that they had received reports that there was a gun in the vicinity. The officers patted Ourlicht down, lifted him by the belt, \\"check[ed] underneath [him], and check[ed his] pockets.\\" The other individuals sitting outside were also told to lie on the ground, were lifted by their belts, and were searched. After the men had been lying on the ground for about ten minutes, the officers told them they could get up. The officers then demanded that all of the men provide their names and identification. The NYPD was unable to provide any evidence to support the notion that the police received a report of a gun in Ourlicht's vicinity on June 6 or June 9, 2008, or that a gun was ever recovered from the area. On August 24, 2009, Ourlicht participated in a photo array procedure with his counsel and defendants' counsel in an attempt to identify the officers who were involved with the June 2008 stop. Ourlicht viewed a total of four hundred and two photographs and indicated eleven officers who he thought might have been present at the time of the incident. Of those eleven officers, only one was assigned to the patrol area at the time of the incident. The other ten officers who were identified were either not employed by the NYPD at the time of the incident or were not assigned to the patrol area at the time. Independent of these two occurrences, various NYPD officers testified that they have been instructed to complete a certain number of stops or arrests, or to issue a certain number of summonses, per tour or per month; and certain supervisors have testified they have so instructed their subordinates. The plaintiffs also submitted audio recordings on which various precinct commanders issued orders to produce certain numbers of arrests, stops and frisks, and summonses during roll call. In addition, plaintiffs stated that in May 2004, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association filed a labor grievance on behalf of six officers and one sergeant who were transferred out of the 75th precinct for allegedly failing to meet a ten summons-per-month quota. In January 2006, a labor arbitrator found that the 75th precinct had imposed summons quotas on its officers in violation of New York State labor laws. One officer testified that when he was a patrol officer in the 41st Precinct, he witnessed his fellow officers illegally stop, search, handcuff, and charge minority residents with crimes. He furthered testified that he had witnessed fellow officers stop civilians without reasonable suspicion and issue summonses without probable cause; and on several occasions, he and his fellow officers were ordered by supervisors to fill out and sign UF250 forms for stops and frisks that they did not conduct or observe and to issue criminal court summonses for incidents they did not observe. Plaintiffs David Floyd, Lalit Clarkson, Deon Dennis, and David Ourlicht bring this putative class action against the City of New York, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and named and unnamed New York City Police Officers (\\"Defendants\\"), alleging that defendants have implemented and sanctioned a policy, practice, and/or custom of unconstitutional stops and frisks by the New York Police Department (\\"NYPD\\") on the basis of race and/or national origin, in violation of Section 1983. Aside from their individual claims, the plaintiffs alleged that the NYPD purposefully engaged in a widespread pattern and practice of concentrating its stop and frisk activity on Black and Hispanic neighborhoods based on their racial composition rather than legitimate non-racial factors, with the result that Blacks and Hispanics are unconstitutionally burdened by illegal stops on the basis of their race. Legal background The New York City stop-and-frisk program is a practice of the New York City Police Department by which a police officer who reasonably suspects a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a felony or a penal law misdemeanor, stops and questions that person, and, if the officer reasonably suspects he or she is in danger of physical injury, frisks the person stopped for weapons. The rules for stop and frisk are found in New York State Criminal Procedure Law section 140.50, and are based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of Terry v. Ohio About 684,000 people were stopped in 2011. The vast majority of these people were African-American or Latino. New York City residents have questioned whether these stops are based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. According to NYPD statistics from 2002 through 2012, an average of one in eight people stopped were accused of a crime. In 2003, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York first addressed the NYPD's application of \\"stop and frisk\\" on minority groups in Daniels, et al. v. the City of New York. Daniels was resolved through a settlement agreement requiring the City to adopt several remedial measures intended to reduce racial disparities in stops and frisks. Under the terms of that settlement, the NYPD enacted a Racial Profiling Policy; revised the UF250 form, otherwise known as a \\"Stop, Question and Frisk Report Worksheet,\\" so that stops would be more accurately documented; and instituted regular audits of the UF250 forms, among other measures. The policy \\"prohibits the use of race, color, ethnicity or national origin as a determinative factor in taking law enforcement action,\\" though those markers may be used to identify a suspect in the same way that pedigree information (height, weight, and age, etc.) is used. The Racial Profiling Policy further requires that commanding officers establish self-inspections within their command to monitor compliance with the policy; that the NYPD Quality Assurance Division (\\"QAD\\") audit compliance with the self-inspection directive; and that CompStat review include consideration of \\"performance in this area.\\" The decisions On August 31, 2011, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that (1) in Floyd's case, the officers had reasonable suspicion that suspect was engaged in burglary, warranting Terry stop and search; (2) in Ourlicht's case, an issue of material fact existed as to whether individuals who stopped suspect were from police department; and (3) an issue of material fact existed as to whether police department engaged in widespread practice of suspicionless stops and frisks of African-American and Latino suspects. The court granted the City of New York's motion for summary judgment on Floyd's Fourth Amendment claim on the grounds that a reasonable jury could find that it was objectively unreasonable for the officers to search Floyd based on a determination of reasonable suspicion. The court further held that the officers did not impermissibly use race as the determinative factor in deciding to stop and frisk Floyd. Floyd subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration with the court. However, the court denied the motion for summary judgment regarding the class action Fourth Amendment claim. The Honorable Shira A. Scheindlin found that, \\"there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the NYPD leadership has been deliberately indifferent to the need to train, monitor, supervise, and discipline its officers adequately in order to prevent a widespread pattern of suspicionless and race-based stops.\\" The court held that regardless of the changes required by Daniels, et al. v. the City of New York, the City's purported corrective actions were insufficient to negate the inference that intentional discrimination was the City's \\"standard operating procedure.\\" Floyd's motion was granted, and on November 23, 2011, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held that there was a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Floyd was in an area with pattern of burglaries. On August 12, 2013, Judge Scheindlin ruled that the police department had violated the Fourth Amendment by conducting unreasonable searches and the Fourteenth Amendment by systematically conducting stops and frisks in a racially discriminatory manner. Status The case went to trial on March 18 through 20, 2013. On August 12th, 2013, Judge Scheindlin handed down two rulings in favor of the plaintiffs, one on liability and one dealing with remedies. The remedies opinion also applied to Ligon, et al. v. City of New York, a lawsuit brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union, The Bronx Defenders, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, and the law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP challenging the use of stops and frisks in private buildings through what is known as Operation Clean Halls. Included in Judge Scheindlin's remedies opinion were a number of significant measures, including the establishment of an independent monitor to oversee the police department's reform efforts. On October 31, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted the City's motion to stay the \\"remedial opinion\\" and the \\"liability opinion\\" while the appeal was pending.Ligon v. City of New York, 538 Fed. Appx. 101(unpublished opinion 2013) The Second Circuit remanded the case to District Court to be heard by a new judge on the basis that the district court judge had run afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. The Appeals Court held this because she had appeared to signal plaintiffs in Daniels v. City of New York, No. 99 Civ. 1695, 2001 WL 228091 (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 8, 1999) in 2007 that she would accept a case as related if plaintiffs brought one with \\"inappropriate racial profiling,\\" and also stated, ‚Äú[W]hat I am trying to say, I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it, for $65 you can bring that lawsuit.‚ÄùLigon v. City of New York, 538 Fed. Appx. 101, footnote 1 The court also noted that she had given several interviews regarding the case.Ligon v. City of New York, 538 Fed.

These products differ from traditional homeowner design software and other online design tools in that they use HTML5 to ensure that changes to the design occur rapidly. This category of software as a service puts an emphasis on usability, speed, and customization.  Background  Homeowners, contractors, and architects use virtual home exterior design software to help visualize changes to designs. Since virtual home design suites that use HTML5 are able to rapidly propagate changes to the home design, users can A/B test designs much more efficiently than with previous iterations of online design software. Virtual home design software has found widespread usage among homeowners who have suffered property damage, as server-side, HTML5-based design software is ideal for homeowners who wish to see what certain products will look like on damaged areas of their houses.  Examples  Several manufacturers use virtual home design software to display their products online. These companies that utilize virtual home design software include GAF Materials Corporation, James Hardie, Exterior Portfolio, and CertainTeed. Some companies, such as Design My Exterior, have built virtual home design software that is not limited to products or brands in order to allow for greater flexibility by the end-user. Design My Exterior also uses ImageMapster in order to generate a greater range of options with less processing time. Live Home 3D is a virtual home design software for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Future applications Several companies are experimenting with virtual reality for architecture. They design virtual homes and allow customers to walk around with the help of a VR headset (such as the Occulus Rift). This way, customers get a realistic, true-to-scale idea of the end result.

The Signal Troops are an integral part of the Armed Forces. Its condition and functioning largely influences efficiency of command, the timeliness of combat equipment and weapons. In its development, the Signal Troops has come a long and difficult process that is inextricably linked with the history of the Armed Forces, the changes in the forms and methods of their use and the improvement of military art. From simple audio and visual means of communication for the transmission of signals and commands on the battlefield to widely branched multi-channel, advanced automated systems that can provide a link of virtually unlimited range of both stationary and moving objects on the ground, in the water, under the water and in the air, this is the historical path of development and improvement of military communications. Communication on the battlefield is one of the main types of operational support. History Due to the spatial scale of hostilities, the communication problem in the military in the 19th century acquired great importance. In the Imperial Russian Army the first attempts to introduce the telegraph took place during the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878, and it brought along with it enormous benefit in the management of troops, they have led to greater use of means of communication. Telegraphs and telephones occupied a prominent place in the management of troops, with the most widely developed mobile lines for leading troops directly in the war theater. At the end of the 19th century the military telegraph and telephone park consisting of units directly administered by the Chief Engineer's Office, operated lines in Central Russia - 17 lines (975 miles) and the Caucasus - two (130 miles). In addition, the fortresses were given 55 communication nodes (423 miles). In February 1905, in the Red Village, where there was a military warehouse of radios purchased abroad, was sent a group of officers, graduates of military signalers electrical schools to train stations to study the experience of command and control in combat conditions. Already in March 1905, these officers were sent to fight in the Russo-Japanese war that spring, and were integrated into the regular forces of the Army. In 1912, the Signals Corps was raised as a separate arm, with Corps units in the Army. These Corps consists of two signals divisions (8 infantry regiments in 4 brigades), one signals battalion (one and three sapper telegraph company) and one field engineering department park was stocked with 20 telegraphs, 193 telegraphs and 333 cable lines. The Corps fought bravely in the actions of the First World War. After the October Revolution and as the Russian Civil War had dawned in 1918, the Red Army officially reorganized the Russian Signals Corps, and October 20, 1919 they were officially recognized as special troops, as signals units distinguished themselves in action during the Civil War days. In 1941, during the Great Patriotic War, the post of the Chief of Signals Troops was created by orders of the People's Commissariat for Defense, the office holder would later acquire Marshal rank in 1944 (3 more generals would be promoted to Marshal of Signals Troops after the war).

Reza de Wet, born in a small town (Senekal) in the Free State, South Africa is considered one of South Africa's great female playwrights.Rautenbach, Elmari ‚ÄúLeukemie eis Reza de Wet‚Äù ‚ÄúBeeld‚Äù 28 Januarie 2012 Brink, Andr√© P. ‚ÄúRapport‚Äù 22 Maart 1987 Odendaal, L.B. ‚ÄúTydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe‚Äù Jaargang 27 no. 3, September 1987 Olivier, Fanie ‚ÄúRapport‚Äù 29 Junie 1986 Schutte, H.J. ‚ÄúTydskrif vir Letterkunde‚Äù Jaargang 26, no. 4 November 1989 Van Vuuren, Helize ‚ÄúDie Burger‚Äù 16 April 1987 After graduating from University of Cape Town drama school she worked extensively as an actress, had a master's degree in English Literature and lectured in the drama department of Rhodes University in Grahamstown. She was a prolific, and socially conscious writer who had written 12 plays in 15 years (five in English and seven in Afrikaans). She won nine awards for her scripts (five Vita Awards, three Fleur du Cap Awards and a Dalro Award) as well as every prestigious literary award (a CNA Prize, a Rapport Prize and twice the Herzog Prize) and productions of her plays have won more than 40 theatre awards. Yelena won the Vita Award for Best Script (1998‚Äì99) while Drie Susters Twee (Three Sisters), was named Best Production for the same year. She has won more theatre and literary awards than any other South African playwright, including the prestigious Herzog Prize for drama(1994), the highest honour in Afrikaans literature. In Open Space, an anthology of new African plays, she is the only woman represented and one of two South African dramatists. Aside from chipping away at the societal mores of Apartheid and racism, stylistically, her stories masterfully weaved Biblical myths, tribal and Afrikaner folktales, magical realism, and stream- of-consciousness storytelling in such a poignant and wholeheartedly original way, as to completely reinvent the psychological-thriller format. A feature film based on 'Diepe Grond' (African Gothic) was adapted for the screen and produced by Damon Shalit. Damon played the role of Frikkie and Chella Ferrow the role of Sussie. The film was directed by Gabriel Bologna in 2012. In 2013, the film was screened in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, where Reza De Wet lived, to commemorate the anniversary of her death. African Gothic In 1985 when playwright Reza de Wet unleashed her creative vision, fully formed and perfectly pitched, on an unsuspecting and quite impotent South-African theatre scene, she presented a subtle but radical alternative to the agitprop and comfortable entertainment seen on South African stages at that time. Right from the beginning of what had become a sustained and prolific career, she proved to be able to unnerve and amuse in equal measure while tapping into a dark and richly subversive vein, mining both gold and puss from a festering Afrikaner psyche. South Africa in the 1980s was a very different place from the country of today. Black schoolchildren were marching in the streets, protesting against a repressive system of Apartheid and a second rate education in Afrikaans (then called 'the Language of the Oppressor'). The police were shooting at these children. Young white men, on the other hand, were expected to pass into manhood and citizenship by a two-year rite of passage fighting a senseless and indefensible terrorist war on our borders. Mothers organised knitting circles to make socks for their sons and sent Christmas-parcels (that invariably contained rusks and a Bible) to a mysterious 'front' somewhere up north. The State-controlled radio and television quite successfully fed us a sanitised version of the truth and from the pulpits of the Dutch Reformed Church religious leaders extolled the Nationalists' version of 'loving thy neighbour as thyself' in the comforting guise of 'separate but equal'. And apart from the occasional bump up against reality, many whites could still pretend that the world they lived in was relatively safe, sound and perhaps even moral. Censorship was the order of the day. In 1985, one of the great Afrikaans playwrights, Bartho Smit, had effectively been silenced and the work of another important playwright, Pieter Fourie, was constantly being emasculated. For a time, he was reduced to writing farces. To counter the drought that hit Afrikaans Drama, the Afrikaans Language and Culture Organization (ATKV) started an annual Campus Festival to stimulate new student drama, and it is here that Reza, the actress from the small town of Senekal in the Free State, then a Professor of Drama from Rhodes University in Grahamstown, staged her first play. From this debut it was immediately clear that a major new voice had announced itself. African Gothic (Diepe Grond, 1985) understandably sparked off intense debate. Using a technique of literary model or reference that has served Reza de Wet well over the years, (an entire thesis could be constructed around her use of fairy tales, Christian myth and references to the works of Poe, the Br√∂ntes and obviously Chekov) African Gothic was a knowing subversion of a popular Afrikaans children's story set on an idyllic farm; a South African Eden where the parents were good and responsible, the children safe and sound, the black nanny a second mother and friend, the workers smiling and happy and a benevolent God ever-watchful and at home in Heaven. With one perverse and masterly gesture Reza de Wet killed off the parents who built the world we grew up in and made the lovers doomed to re-enact key incidents from their childhood to pass the time. A mainly silent black nanny, who has become both mother and God, watches with great love as her former employer's children self-destruct. Even the order of day and night are reversed. Frikkie and Soekie go to sleep at sunrise and rise at sunset to start their work. Where crops used to grow from neatly ploughed furrows, the farm now lies fallow as they burrow through the floor of their room in a futile attempt to strike a source of life-giving water. Here was a play that clearly overturned every single rule and moral principle that upheld society and were accepted as the norm by the very people that set up the Campus Festival, a new type of Afrikaner. Just a year later the Rock movement known as 'Vo√´lvry' (meaning; to be declared an outlaw) launched itself as a populist form of protest and gave voice to a rebellious generation of Frikkies and Soekies who, through music, happily killed their parents and what they stood for. RE-DREAMING Anton Chekhov Rehearsal 2001 Reza de Wet's last three plays have drawn on Russian author Anton Chekhov as inspiration. DRIE SUSTERS TWEE (THREE SISTERS TWO) have the characters of Chekhov's THREE SISTERS moving to the structure and rhythm of THE CHERRY ORCHARD. The shadowy undertow of UNCLE VANYA, so carefully concealed behind Chekhov's lively dialogues, became the expressionistic spirit in the award-winning YELENA. This year, opening at the National Arts festival, de Wet's ON THE LAKE borrowed from THE SEAGULL, recalling the life of the actress Nina, who longs for freedom; Madame Arkadina, losing the battle against the passing of youth; and Polina, whose life consists of dashed hopes. But it would be simplistic to view these plays by Reza de Wet as mere Chekhov sequels. This is only a guise. For de Wet, the plays have been an investigation into the way Chekhov envisaged theatre, and a grappling with the process of transformation. While Chekhov has now become a favourite among the realist classics few productions seem to take heed of his vision of what theatre could and should be. A recent acclaimed production of THE CHERRY ORCHARD in London played for over three hours; but de Wet's research revealed that Chekhov had intended the third act to last for only fourteen minutes. Chekhov's deriding of Stanislavsky's directing and acting of THE SEAGULL is now famous: ‚ÄúThe stage demands a degree of artifice ‚Ä¶ What would happen if you cut the nose out of one of Kramskoy‚Äôs paintings and substituted a real one? The nose would be ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô but the picture would be ruined.‚Äù It seemed that Chekhov intended a different style of acting, more rhythmic, lighter on the psychology ‚Ä¶ almost like a farce or vaudeville. ‚ÄúI feel that Chekhov intended elements that are still not explored in productions and understandings of his plays,\\" said de Wet. In his conversations and correspondences with Meyerhold and Gogol ‚Äì also renowned Russian theatre practitioners ‚Äì Chekhov proposed a radical vision for theatre performance that is not character-driven, but focused on the actor's presence, atmosphere, and the ritual and musical pattern of the play. As Meyerhold wrote: ‚ÄúFor Chekhov, the characters ‚Ä¶ are the means and not the end ‚Ä¶ Chekhov‚Äôs art demands a theatre of mood.‚Äù Shrouded in mystery, the power of Chekhov lies not in the manifest dialogue and scenes of the visible world; they are plays written in the margin of other events,‚Äù said de Wet. ON THE LAKE virtually revolves around the one absent character: Kostia, whose suicide ten years before still leaves indelible marks on the women of the play. The yearnings, regrets and memories of Kostia haunt them ‚Äì particularly Nina, whose dreams of art and freedom, once centred on Kostia‚Äôs revolutionary theatre, are now jaded amidst her disillusionment. Instead, the play‚Äôs ‚Äúheroine‚Äù spends most of the play listening to the other characters‚Äô complaints, entreaties and manipulations ‚Äì another entity standing on the margins of events. As the play's director as well as playwright, de Wet's investigations were even more significantly revealed in the acting. Grethe Fox's Polina was like a wind-up doll, exploding in grievances until the energy winded down ‚Äì then violently gushing out again. Her wailing reminded one of incantation, a ritual of mourning; and her character's deep grieving arose not so much from the believability of circumstances or from the words she spoke, but from some doomed spirit of loss that was at once pathetic and moving. Brink Scholtz's rehearsal of Nina was based on images from Alice in Wonderland, and the expressions and postures of \\"Victorian maidens in distress,\\" said de Wet, who appreciated that the clich√©s of popular culture could, in a peculiar way, evoke identification and resonances. As de Wet wrote in the programme: ON THE LAKE is an exploration ... of non-literary forms of public entertainment which transcends the narrow confines of realism ... the magic of the pantomime, the vaudeville, the tragic clown, and the poignant mystery of the marionette who wipes away the tear while holding the handkerchief just a little away from its face. Puppetry and the clown figure, closely relating to the grotesque, featured prominently in Meyerhold's theatre ‚Äì and, as de Wet's research showed, Chekhov was extremely sympathetic to Meyerhold's approach. At one stage, Fox rehearsed with arms tied in splints, and Annelisa Weiland with her hair bands tied around her fingers, as if her Arkadina was a marionette. De Wet wanted to bring about a meeting of Chekhov and Meyerhold's work, appropriating elements of vaudeville, commedia d‚Äôell arte and the ‚Äúfairground booth‚Äù (the title of Meyerhold's famous essay on theatre), and Japanese Noh theatre, and to search for a theatre performance text. ON THE LAKE thus sets out to be a performance of ‚Äúpurely theatrical poetry, blending with the grotesque and the ritualistic aspects ‚Ä¶ it is densely atmospheric,‚Äù said de Wet. ‚ÄúFor me this resounds much more than realistic characterisation ‚Äì they have a simplicity which gives much power.‚Äù ‚Äì Like the mechanical gestures of the marionette wiping the tears, which nevertheless wields the power of mystery. Anyone remember the puppeting sequences in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH? De Wet is aware that they play created certain confusions for audiences. South African audiences have tended to expect theatre resembling literature, to become timid and unimaginative, said de Wet. Such responses would be expected of audiences wanting to see characters and stories but being offered instead a theatre of infectious atmospheres. ‚ÄúUnfortunately there is no time for ‚Äòpeeping-tom theatre ‚Äì as Artaud described it ‚Äì its really dying on its feet!‚Äù De Wet's theatre does not mirror nature or Chekhov. Her plays are distorting magnifying glasses that reveal quintessence, the exhilarating of theatre. \\"I feel more than ever that the theatre event should be other-worldly; it should enthral, being both realistic and highly theatricalised. Theatre is the best metaphor for the world that exists on the cusp between reality and dream.,\\" writes Reza. Realistically speaking, her new explorations will require a new audience willing to follow, de Wet said, and audiences have such precise expectations. Like Nina's stage that flies away at the end of ON THE LAKE, de Wet felt that she has been left a little suspended. Kostia's search for \\"new forms\\" is accompanied by a fundamental irony and sadness: the artist is aware of the limitations. But ten years on, the dreamer, Nina, would revisit the stage and liberate the theatre that failed for Kostia, and so win her freedom. Dreaming of the dreamer's flight, de Wet's ON THE LAKE grapples with the essential wellspring of living: the loss and the renewal of inspiration and artistic creation. She died on 27 January 2012 from leukaemia at her home.

He is the son of Joann (n√©e Ebeling) and Angus Gilchrist Wynne Jr. His father was a developer in the postwar housing boom when he was president of the American Home Realty Company, developers of Wynnewood Village in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. At the time, it was the largest real estate development of its kind in the country. Along with real estate, Wynne Jr. was involved in the amusement park business and founded the Great Southwest Corporation, Six Flags Over Texas, Six Flags over Georgia, and Six Flags over Mid-America. Wynne is the grandson of Nemo Shelmire Wynne and Angus Gilchrist Wynne Sr., an East Texas lawyer who was prominent in Democratic Party politics and was the first president of the State Bar of Texas. Wynne is the great grandson of William Benjamin \\"Buck\\" Wynne, an eminent Dallas lawyer, and Margaret Henderson Wynne. On his paternal grandmother‚Äôs side, he is the great grandson of Dr. Jesse Bedford Shelmire, a distinguished and pioneer dermatologist who was the first in the Southwest to be honored with membership in the American Dermatological Association, and served as the chair of dermatology at Baylor University College of Medicine, which he held until his retirement in 1927. Wynne has two older brothers, Angus Gilchrist Wynne III and David Ebeling Wynne, and one sister, Mary Temple Wynne. Professional life  Early career and 8.0  Wynne began his career as a restaurateur in 1980. After his favorite bar in Dallas, the Stoneleigh P, burned down, Wynne and a group of friends and investors brought together their resources and opened 8.0 Bar (\\"Eight-Oh\\"). 8.0 lit up the Dallas nightclub scene and, over the next three years, Wynne opened a string of O-clubs and restaurants across Dallas including Nostromo, The Rio Room, Rocco Oyster Bar, Mexico, and Tango(where Count Basie played opening night). By 1982, the \\"O\\" restaurants and venues were what was happening in Dallas. Wynne's Nostromo was a popular, yet signless, restaurant. It spawned The Rio Room, located in the back of Nostromo. Wynne ventured into casual dining with the opening of a Tex-Mex Mexican restaurant, Mexico, and an Italian restaurant, Palermo. Wynne's popular Rocco Oyster Bar was known for its fresh seafood, New Orleans standards juke box and white tile setting. James Brown, Lisa Loeb, Joe King Carrasco and Tina Turner on her comeback could be found playing at Tango, with Bob \\"Daddy-O\\" Wade's 'Six Frogs Over Greenville' on top of the building where, inside the former bank building, there was plenty of room to dance. In 1994, Wynne designed and opened 8.0 Bar in Sundance Square in Fort Worth, Texas.  Flying Saucer Draught Emporium  In 1995, Wynne designed and opened the first Flying Saucer Draught Emporium in Sundance Square with Keith Schlabs. The restaurant included an extensive beer selection, with hundreds of options in bottles and over 80 quality hand-crafted beers on tap. The Flying Saucer now has three location in the DFW metroplex as well as other units including Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Lake Ray Hubbard and Sugarland; Kansas City, Missouri; LIttle Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; Cordova, Tennessee; Nashville, Tennessee, Charlotte, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; and Raleigh, North Carolina. As of 2015, Robert Wynne (no relation) was the first and only person to earn a plate at every Flying Saucer location. In May 2012 the Fort Worth 8.0 on Sundance Square was closed to make way for The Flying Saucer Draught Emporium and Bird Cafe.  Flying Fish  In 2002, Wynne designed and opened the first Flying Fish, a casual seafood restaurant, in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Flying Fish serves catfish, shrimp, oysters, crawfish and other seafood. Wynne expanded the restaurant throughout North Texas with locations in Addison, Dallas: Irving Blvd., Dallas: Preston Center, Garland, Fort Worth, Arlington, Plano, Garland: Firewheel, and Houston. There is also a location in Memphis, Tennessee.  Meddlesome Moth and Moth Management  In 2010, Wynne designed and opened Meddlesome Moth, a gastro pub with a tap room and a chef driven menu. The restaurant, the first to be located in the Dallas Design District, offers an extensive beer selection with a rare cask tapped weekly. The Moth features art works by James Surls, Frank Tolbert, Dmitri Vail and many others. In 2013, Wynne designed and opened LARK on the Park overlooking Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, TX.

In November 1600 English privateer William Parker sailed from Plymouth, England in command of a modest venture consisting of the 100 ton Prudence, the 60 ton Pearl commanded by Robert Rawlins, a pinnace and two shallops with crew in all numbering 200 men. At Cubagua they were offered a ransom in exchange for a number of pearl boats they had seized. Near Cabo de le Veda they captured a Portuguese slaving ship. Parker next guided what was now a flotilla of 6 ships to the east of a recently abandoned Nombre de Dios and approached Portobello in pinnaces and shallops with the help of the black guides.Bradley p.128-129 Assault Under cover of darkness early in the morning of 6 February they employed a captured Portuguese to respond to a challenge from the newly completed fort of San Felipe on the North shore and after succeeding in this ruse were able to bypass the place without hindrance. They then disembarked a vanguard of some forty men from the shallops. Parker and his men were then able to enter the city on the south shore unopposed since the castle of Santiago de la Gloria was positioned too far away to offer any protection. Whilst some of their party created as much noise and panic as possible in their attack on the barracks and crown buildings the remainder of the English took control of the harbour. The 100 Spanish defenders which the Spanish Governor Pedro Mel√©ndez had sent was too little too late.Bradley p.128-129 There was a bitter battle fought to seize the treasure house but it was captured after some forty Spaniards were surrounded all being either killed or captured. The English were able to push the rest of Spanish troops with ease inland and with only a few casualties. By the end of the day however Parker had secured the town and set about garrisoning the place. About 30 Spanish prisoners were taken among whom was the governor and several persons of importance. The English prepared for a Spanish counterattack but it never came. Aftermath Parker could only hold the town for 24 hours and the next day found no large bullion shipments. He did however acquire a large haul of booty and he had taken a further three prizes when the harbor was secured. Parker then went about sacking the town and he burnt the suburb of Triana to the ground. After this and with all the booty that could be collected along with cannons, Parker then withdrew releasing the prisoners. The English then stood out to sea with a total 10,000 ducats of booty. Parker, set sail for England. Parker then returned to Plymouth in May 1601 where he distributed his prize money and in September of that year became Mayor. He would then become a founding member of the Virginia Company in 1606.

It involved a rebel assault led by Fawzi al-Qawuqji against Mandatory French security installations in Hama and a subsequent uprising by residents sympathetic to the rebel cause. Heavy French bombardment of the city and the dispatch of reinforcements followed. The hostilities began on 4 October 1925 and negotiations between a delegation of Hama's leading families and the French authorities resulted in the rebels' withdrawal on 5 October.Provence, 2005, pp. 98‚Äì99. Background In 1918, during World War I, the Ottoman Turks were driven out of Syria by the Allied Forces and their Hashemite Arab allies, after which the latter assumed authority over the country. In 1920 France gained control of Syria under the auspices of a mandate by the League of Nations, a move largely rejected by the general population. Syria was divided into six autonomous entities, including the State of Damascus and Jabal Druze State. Tensions between the French authorities and the leaders of Jabal al- Druze began to surface from 1922 and in the mid-summer of 1925, the Druze leader Sultan Pasha al-Atrash declared an uprising against the French Mandate after the imprisonment of three prominent Druze leaders who were invited to Damascus for talks with the authorities. After a number of significant military successes against the French Army, Syrian nationalists throughout the country were inspired to take up arms. One of those nationalists who was particularly impressed by the actions of al-Atrash's men was Fawzi al- Qawuqji,Provence, 2005, p. 97. a veteran soldier from the Ottoman army who fought against the Italian occupation of Libya and later against the Allied forces in Syria. In 1925 he served as a cavalry commander for the French Syrian Legion.Provence, 2005, p. 95. The city of Hama, which was part of the State of Damascus and was third largest city in Syria at the time, was \\"known for its Islamic conservatism and fierce opposition to French rule,\\" according to historian Michael Provence. Together with members of the city's religious establishment, al-Qawuqji formed the Hizb Allah (\\"Party of God\\"), an outfit for anti-French activity. The party, according to al-Qawuqji, was devoted to nationalism and independence from France, but there was also an apparent religious character to the organization. Hama itself was far more outwardly religious compared to Damascus.Provence, 2005, p. 96. Planning Following the Druze assault against the French Army at al-Musayfirah, al-Qawuqji sent emissaries to al-Atrash to notify him of the strength of his Hama-based forces, request that al-Atrash maintain the pressure against French troops in the Hauran, and to establish oral communication between their forces via a trusted connection. Al-Qawuqji's membership in the French Mandatory army allowed for him to keep track of the routines and activities of the French command in Hama. His party also had the support of large segments of Hama's inhabitants, many of whom were members, while the French lacked any local sympathy.Provence, 2005, pp. 97‚Äì98. In the months preceding the uprising in Hama, al-Qawuqji had been fostering close ties with Hama's religious leaders, local Bedouin, the merchants and the police, encouraging them to join in a holy war against the French and promising them to divide the riches of the government's offices and banks, which he claimed had been stolen from the Syrian people. The city's landlords also lent their support to al-Qawuqji due to their opposition to planned French land reforms.Thompson, 2000, p. 46. Despite al-Qawuqji's apparently wide scale campaign promoting rebellion, French intelligence was unaware of an impending uprising.Provence, 2005, p. 98. Uprising On 4 October, at 7:00 pm, al-Qawuqji commanded the mutiny of his entire cavalry unit and together with irregulars from the nomadic Mawali tribe, his forces numbered in the hundreds. According to Provence, al-Qawuqji had the local \\"Syrian Legion, several hundred bedouin tribesmen and the entire population of Hama behind him.\\"Provence, 2005, p. 99. The rebels proceeded to occupy the city, cutting off its telephone lines, blocking its main thoroughfares and assaulting the government palace (saray). In their attack against the saray, the rebels captured several French officers who had not fled and released prisoners being held in the compound. The city had fallen to al-Qawuqji's forces by 11:30 pm. In response, French forces commenced a heavy aerial bombardment of the city from sunrise the following morning, 5 October, until the early afternoon.Rogan, 2011, p. 230. The bulk of French ground forces had been concentrated in Jabal al-Arab at the time. Most of Hama's souks (\\"bazaars\\") and numerous homes of leading city notables were consequently destroyed. Meanwhile, two companies of French reinforcements from Rayak and Aleppo were rushed to dislodge the rebels. French authorities had also mobilized the support of the rural landlords against Hama's urban and tribal nationalist leaders. Hama's major landowning families, who had initially supported al-Qawuqji's plans for revolt, feared further destruction to their property. Represented by mayor Najib al-Barazi and Farid al-Azm, the head of the city's most influential family al-Azm, they broke rebel ranks and met with Eug√®ne Coustill√®re, the commander of the captured saray, and negotiated an end to the bombardment. In return, the city's notables agreed to convince the rebels to withdraw from the city. By the end of the day, al- Barazi persuaded al-Qawuqji to depart with his men. The uprising and the subsequent bombardment ended with the deaths 344 Syrians, mostly civilians, according to a petition by the city's residents to the League of Nations. The authorities countered that only 76 people were killed, all of them rebels. However, French intelligence documented more than 100 Syrian deaths. Al- Qawuqji was charged with high treason and sentenced to death in absentia while 355 people from Hama were detained by the authorities.Moubayed, 2006, p. 79. Property damage included the destruction of 115 shops, two souks, 144 homes, including several villas. On 10 October the French newspaper Bulletin de Renseignements proclaimed \\"... the excellent impression produced by the energetic manner in which order was restored during the events in ·∏§am√¢h. The prestige of France is vastly increased ...\\"Provence, 2005, pp. 99‚Äì100. Aftermath After withdrawing, al-Qawuqji and his forces regrouped with Ramadan al-Shallash, a rebel leader from Deir ez-Zor, who had just arrived from British-controlled Transjordan. The revolt in Hama was the first major confrontation between rebels and French troops outside of the Hauran and although press censorship officially blocked news of events in the city, word had spread and rebel groups emerged across the country. Particularly in Damascus, its environs and the Ghouta countryside, relatively autonomous insurgent groups increased their guerrilla efforts against the French Army.Provence, 2005, p. 100. According to al-Qawuqji, who continued to foment rebellion in villages across Syria, \\"The gates of Syria's fields were opened before us for revolt.\\" He boasted about the failure of French intelligence and how the \\"cunning\\" of the Arabs triumphed over that of France.Rogan, 2011, p. 231. On 18 October rebels under the leadership of Hasan al-Kharrat and Nasib al-Bakri led a major rebel assault against French troops based in Damascus, occupying the city and capturing the Azm Palace, which served as the residence of the new high-commissioner, General Maurice Sarrail. Al-Shallash managed to participate in the battle, but al-Qawuqji and his men arrived too late.Provence, 2005, p. 103. Following massive aerial and ground bombardment of the city, resulting in thousands of deaths and wide scale destruction, French forces retook Damascus. The commander of the French garrison in Damascus reportedly \\"wished the Damascenes would give France a chance of dealing with them as the Hama rebels had been dealt with.\\" In the following months rebels continued their guerrilla campaign in the Ghouta, but after the imprisonment and exile of hundreds of nationalist leaders, including al- Qawuqji and al-Atrash, the death of al-Kharrat and the defection of al- Shallash,Provence, 2005, pp. 138‚Äì139. the rebels were largely defeated by 26 November. Sporadic fighting in Hama as well as Jabal al-Arab continued until 1927.

Location Buddu lies on the northwest shore of Lake Victoria in the Cental Region of Uganda. Buddu is divided from the rest of the kingdom of Buganda by the wide and swampy Katonga River, but has similar soil and climate. It is fertile farming land, and was well-populated when conquered by Buganda in the late eighteenth century. In 2010, Buddu was split into four districts: Bukomansimbi District, Kalungu District, Lwengo District and Masaka District. Buddu presently includes districts of Bukomansimbi, Lwengo, Kalungu, Masaka and Kyotera(recently part of Rakai district) Province of Baganda In the late eighteenth century the Kabaka Jjunju of Buganda (r. 1780 - 1797) defeated the Nyoro army and captured Buddu, which had been a province of Bunyoro. Buddu was the last territory to be acquired by Buganda before the arrival of the Europeans. In 1892 Buddu was the most prosperous province in the kingdom. That year there was a civil war in Uganda between supporters of the Catholic and Anglican churches. The supporters of the Catholics lost and had to move to Buddu. Uganda was declared a protectorate in 1893. After this the British paid little attention to the Kabaka Mwanga II of Buganda. In July 1897 the British learned that there plans for a revolt, but Mwanga decided against the risk and fled from the capital to Buddu. A minor was crowned in his place, while Mwanga attracted a large number of supporters who were hostile to the colonial regime. In December 1897 there was a fight at Buddu, which turned into an outright revolt a year later. Mwanga finally surrendered in April 1899. Catholic missionary activity Soon after the civil war ended in 1892 the White Fathers Catholic missionary Henri Streicher established the Villa Maria mission in Buddu. At the end of May 1892 Antonin Guillermain and two other White Fathers founded the mission of Notre-Dame de l'Equateur at Buddu, opposite the large island of Siss√© in the north of Lake Victoria. Streicher was made Vicar Apostolic of Northern Victoria Nyanza in February 1897. He made his headquarters at Villa Maria. The chiefs who had converted to Catholicism moved to Buddu, and treated him as both civil and religious leader, equivalent to a king. Streicher assumed some of the royal trappings in his costume. The chiefs sent their sons to be his pages at his court, and they ensured that their followers were converted by the Ganda catechists. In 1902 the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa, or White Sisters, began work in Buddu. By 1907 the mission had 140 resident girls, some wanting to become nuns. A novitiate was established in 1908 and the first three nuns were professed in 1910. By 1926 the community, with headquarters in Buddu, was led by the first Ugandan mother superior, Mama Cecilia Nalube (Mother Ursula.) Buddu became a center of Catholicism in Africa. The first African Catholic Bishop since the early days of Christianity, consecrated in 1939, came from Buddu.

It was originally published in 1978 in Portuguese under the title Objecto Quase. This article refers to the English translation by Giovanni Pontiero, published by Verso in 2012.  Plot  Several of the stories foreground an inanimate object which is pivotal in historical events or human consciousness. \\"Chair\\" is about a mahogany chair which is slowly rotted from within by several generations of anobium though the rot is invisible from the outside. As a consequence of this rot, the chair collapses underneath an unnamed dictator who is identified as former Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar by the book's translator.Pontiero, Giovanni. Forward. The Lives of Things. London: Verso, 2012. In \\"Reflux,\\" an unnamed king has such a fear of death that he cannot bear the sight of a funeral procession, grave stones, or black mourning clothes. So he commissions the building of a giant cemetery with high walls in the center of the unnamed country of which he is leader. The cemetery requires major re-engineering and excavation of much of the country's infrastructure. But it does succeed for some years in shielding the king from any visible reminders of death. So many service industries spring up around the cemetery that it effectively becomes a major city. Eventually, though, a cypress tree, which is a symbol of death in some cultures, becomes visible over the wall, and the king realizes that he cannot ultimately defeat death. In \\"Things,\\" the objects on which humans rely start rebelling against their exploitation. It starts with a sofa that gets too warm to sit in and proceeds to the disappearance of whole apartment buildings and the deaths of their inhabitants. Humans decide to fight back with an attack on part of the city. Many city dwellers gather together in the countryside to watch the attack. When the attack is imminent, however, the entire city simply disappears. So do all the clothes of the assembled citizens, leaving them without any of the trappings of civilization. It turns out that there is a community of people who have been living in the woods without the benefit of technology or manufacture. At the end of the story, these people comment that never again will people be treated as things. In \\"Embargo,\\" an unidentified man finds that he is trapped in his car for no apparent reason. It appears that the car has found a will of its own and refuses to let him leave. The car refuses to go where the man intends to drive. Instead, it keeps getting in line at gas stations even though the tank is nearly full. This takes place during a gas crisis, so the lines are quite long. In the end, the man dies and only then slides out of his car. \\"The Centaur\\" imagines the last of the half-man, half- horse men wandering through the woods avoiding human developments through the centuries. Throughout much of the story, the man part of the centaur experiences life separately from the horse part. For instance, the horse falls asleep while the man is still awake. At the end of the story, the beast/man can no longer endure his loneliness and abducts a woman, though not with any intention to assault her. This draws attention to him for the first time in centuries. A group of men hunts down and surrounds him with nets and weapons. In an attempt to escape, the centaur loses his footing on a steep hill and falls onto a jagged rock which impales him. At the end of the story, he apprehends his own death.  Composition and Publication  Saramago lost his job as deputy director of the newspaper Di√°rio de N√≥ticias in 1975, for what he believes were political reasons. Convinced that he would be unable to find further employment, he rededicated himself to writing literature after a hiatus of nineteen years. The Lives of Things was written early in this period of renewed commitment to literature and published in 1978, one year after the publication of Saramago's first novel, Manual of Painting and Calligraphy.The Lives of Things was also written in the years that followed the dictatorship of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar. This is worth mentioning because Saramago's work as a whole is often evaluated in the light of his communist ideals and reviews of the English translation of The Lives of Things focused some attention on Saramago's political convictions‚Äîwhich were shaped largely in response to Salazar's government. An article in the Oxonian suggests several literary influences for Saramago's work as a whole and The Lives of Things in particular. Reviewer Andrew Fleming indicates that Saramago's work has some things in common with magical realist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. However, \\"There is a lot more going on in Saramago‚Äôs prose, attitudes that would restore the menace to 'magical' and the grit to 'realism,'\\" Fleming writes. A more immediate and obvious influence on Saramago is Fernando Pessoa whose work, like Saramago's, is \\"ruminative\\" and \\"unearthly.\\" In \\"Embargo,\\" Fleming sees automotive themes that echo the works of J.G. Ballard and Anna Kavan.Fleming, Andrew. \\"A Weird Significance.\\" Oxonian Review. Oxford University. 2 July 2012. Web. 27 March 2013.  Reception  The Lives of Things was reviewed in only a few English-language publications. Reviewers agree that the stories are seminal: their allegorical devices foreshadow Saramago's later, greater works, especially Blindness and The Gospel According to Jesus Christ. Most reviews also find the stories allegorical and pointing to political messages. Most reviews also comment on Saramago's distinctive use of language which features long, unwieldy sentences and eccentric punctuation. The Wall Street Journal's mostly negative review finds the collection marred by heavy-handed political messages while allowing that the stories are inventive. Reviewer Sohrab Ahmari argues that Saramago's literary imagination was permanently etched by the dictatorship of Salazar. The collection's didactic rejection of capitalism, Ahmari believes, is inevitable because Saramago's life was \\"so deeply compromised by toxic politics.\\" By contrast, a University of Rochester review praises the stories' inventiveness and Saramago's ability to splice realistic and supernatural elements into political allegory. Reviewer Aleksandra Fazlipour writes that \\"with or without the political context, the book is the kind of read that ensnares you, drawing you into its world and forcing you to see things a particular way‚ÄîSaramago‚Äôs way--while you compulsively turn the pages.\\"Fazlipour, Aleksandra. \\"The Lives of Things.\\" Three Percent. University of Rochester, 20 July 12. Web. 27 March 2013. BookForum's review finds the political themes of The Lives of Things applicable to contemporary politics. Reviewer Michael Thomsen perceives \\"Things\\" as being the collection's centerpiece. Within the world of that story, political leaders become more rigid about enforcing a set of meaningless rules as a response to an increasingly chaotic, unreliable world. \\"The resonance with our own time is almost too much,\\" Thomsen writes. Kirkus Reviews' treatment of the book was also positive, though the reviewer predicts the book will be mostly of interest to enthusiasts of Jose Saramago. The same review considers \\"The Centaur\\" the best one of the stories, referring to it as a fable about the dual spiritual and animal nature of humans. \\"The Chair,\\" however, might be difficult to understand for people not familiar with the reign of Salazar, according to Kirkus.\\"The Lives of Things.\\" Kirkus Reviews. Kirkus Media. 5 March 2012. 27 March 2013. Booklist Reviewer Brendan Driscoll, on the other hand, writes that \\"The Chair,\\" with its \\"gripping detail,\\" is the strongest of the stories. Driscoll thinks readers unfamiliar with Saramago should read Blindness or The Cave first, but he finds the stories' \\"extended metaphors, long sentences, and moral sensibilities\\" characteristic of Saramago's distinctive style.Driscoll, Brendan. \\"The Lives of Things.\\" Booklist. 108. 16 (Apr 15, 2012): 23. 27 March 2013.

History Petrel OC/CC Standalone From the very beginning the company sought to develop products that are simple to use and easy to read underwater. In 2004, Shearwater Research was founded by Bruce Partridge who produced their products in a spare bedroom at his home. As of 2014, Shearwater was producing thousands of dive computers per year in a manufacturing facility with twenty employees. Shearwater Research began by building controller boards for the Innerspace Systems Corp (ISC) Megalodon rebreathers in 2004. There was a problem with the configuration and by the end of 2005, ISC was no longer offering the Shearwater electronics package. Since that time, the initial issues have been resolved and Shearwater electronics are again available for use on the ISC Megalodons. Predator OC/CC ExternalShearwater decompression computers began with an implementation of the B√ºhlmann decompression algorithm into their Shearwater GF in the Spring of 2006. It was available in either the partial pressure of oxygen with decompression or control versions. In January 2007, the Shearwater GF was the computer used with the JJ-CCR. Shearwater Perdix in compass mode A Shearwater Predator dive computer attached to a rebreather. Image shows screen in reverse orientation that allows the diver to decide where they wear the display With the release of the Predator in 2009, Shearwater moved away from the old LCD display technology to the use of new OLED displays in their computers. This was the first color OLED diving computer available in the market with a user replaceable battery. Power was a major limiting factor in the development process to include the OLED technology. Shearwater received their certification for ISO 9001-2008 in 2010 and all their products are compliant with CE, FCC and IC international standards. With the Predator, Shearwater also introduced bluetooth to allow easier syncing with their desktop software. Their reason for the move to bluetooth was to make a computer that could be used on multiple operating systems. The Predator's two button design has been called \\"intuitive and easy to use\\". The top of the line Predator will also allow for up to five breathing gases for the rebreather and up to five bail-out gasses. The user can make gas switches on the computer at any point during the dive. In 2011, Shearwater announced that they had licensed a technique to monitor carbon dioxide absorbent canister developed by the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit. In collaboration with rEvo rebreathers, they were able to show that the thermal canister CO2 monitor would work with Shearwater's Predator dive computer. Shearwater has continued to develop new ways to calculate decompression in their equipment by releasing an implementation of the Varying Permeability Model (VPM-B/GFS) in 2011. The \\"GFS\\" is for Gradient Factor Surfacing and indicates the combination were VPM and GF models are compared and the longer time utilized for the displayed profile. The Shearwater Petrel has been called the \\"Predator with improvements\\". The Petrel was designed to allow a standard AA battery to drive the power it needs for calculations and OLED display with automatic brightness changing. The unit is 40% smaller than the Predator. The Petrel includes both the B√ºhlmann algorithm and their VPM-B/GFS algorithm. The Petrel also extends the profile data storage that was previously available from 200 to approximately 1000 hours. With the release of the Petrel, Shearwater has also improved the educational materials available to their owners. In 2013, Shearwater was presented with the International System Safety Society Award for safety in \\"Scientific Research & Development\\" at the 31st International System Safety Conference in Boston. Shearwater's NERD or Near Eye Remote Display is a head-up display that places the divers information in front of their eyes. The Shearwater NERD was released at Dive 2013 in Birmingham, UK. In 2015, the Perdix wrist mounted dive computer was released. The Perdix is similar to the Petrel but has a 30% longer battery life and a thinner and lower profile. The computer was named after a (The Founder's surname is Partridge). Unlike the Petrel, the Perdix is only available in a stand-alone configuration and does not have a version that can be connected to a rebreather. In 2016, the Perdix AI was released. The Perdix AI built on the success of the Perdix by adding air integration features. The Perdix AI is designed to function in conjunction with Pelagic Pressure Systems wireless gas pressure transmitters. The Perdix AI allows for 2 cylinder pressures to be reported simultaneously. In 2017, Shearwater launched the NERD 2. A successor to the original NERD heads-up dive computer, the NERD 2 eliminated the brain box from the NERD system, incorporating all of the electronics into the eyepiece. The NERD 2 contains a rechargeable lithium ion battery, heads-up compass, and dual air integration capability. Unlike the original NERD, the NERD 2 is available in a stand-alone model, making it practical for open circuit diving for the first time. The newest dive computer released by Shearwater is the Teric which was launched in May 2018. The Teric is Shearwater's first dive computer in a watch format. Safety outreach In 2010, Shearwater was one of the founding manufacturers for the Rebreather Education and Safety Association. Shearwater's Bruce Partridge served as Secretary for the founding board of the organization. Partridge also presented at the Rebreather Forum 3 meeting held in 2012. He presented on the use of information technology with focus on human factors in equipment design. Shearwater is also a sponsor for the diving research efforts of the Rubicon Foundation. In 2016 Shearwater funded a rebreather sorb absorption research study by Harvey and colleagues. Exploration support A Shearwater Predator was used to calculate decompression on a 2010 expedition that lead to the identification of HMS Snaefell that went down on July 5, 1941. Lance Robb utilized an ISC Megalodon rebreather with a Shearwater Predator in a 2010 expedition to explore Osprey Reef at a depth of . Shearwater also supported research by the University of Connecticut and Ocean Opportunity to explore the Tongue of the Ocean. This project, funded by the National Geographic Society/ Waitt Grants Program to explore the mesophotic zone between and carried The Explorers Club flag number 172. The Shearwater electronics were utilized to record the diver profiles.

She believes that marriage kills love and leads to unhappiness and, inevitably, divorce. Although her boyfriend, Dick Ives II, and his father, Dick Sr., try to persuade Anne to get married, she resists their arguments. She believes it is important for people to be individuals, and that when they marry, they tend to become too emotionally dependent on each other, rather than, as an old suitor says, \\"being responsible to no one but herself.\\" Both Anne and Dick have prior romantic entanglements still in the picture. Margie True admits she still loves Dick, and they talk; he says she will find someone who loves her as much as he loves Anne. Anne and Dick see each other until late at night, and go away for weekends together for a while without getting married. However, after word gets out about a weekend away, Dick pressures Anne, and eventually she caves in to avoid scandal. When the news becomes public, Anne receives a telegram from her ex-boyfriend, Price Baines, saying that he wants to visit her. Dick doesn't want Anne to see him, but she does so anyway. Price tries to persuade Anne not to get married, tells her that he is still in love with her, and warns her that she will be unhappy if she marries, but she has already made up her mind. Anne marries Dick, and they start to behave like a typical married couple, meeting social expectations regarding attending events and visiting people. They seem to be unable to share the romantic time alone together that they did in the past. They tire of each other, avoid each other and fight over silly things. Eventually Anne tells Dick that they need to separate for a time. At first this rekindles the romance. But when Price Baines comes back into the picture, Dick becomes resentful, and starts to take an interest in Margie True, who tells him that she is still in love with him. Price Baines woos Anne aggressively. Ultimately, however, the separation makes Dick and Anne realize that there are no substitutes for each other, in spite of the costs involved.

Specifically, it performs endonucleolytic cleavage that results in single-stranded crossover between two homologous DNA molecules at the Holliday junction to produce recombinant DNA products for chromosomal segregation. This process is known as Holliday junction resolution.  Biological Function  The Holliday junction is a structure that forms during genetic recombination, and links two double- stranded DNA molecules with a single-stranded crossover, which form during mitotic and meiotic recombination. Crossover junction endodeoxyribonucleases catalyze Holiday junction resolution, which is the formation of separate recombinant DNA molecules and chromosomal separation after the crossover event at the Holliday junction. Crossover junction endodeoxyribonucleases with Holliday Junction resolution function have been identified in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. RuvC in bacteria, CCE1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and GEN1 in humans are all crossover junction endodeoxyribonucleases that perform Holliday Junction resolution. Holliday junction resolution catalyzed by crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease is shown in the figure below. Holliday junction resolution catalyzed by crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease. Left: First, four strands of DNA (two black and two white) combine to form two double stranded DNA molecules at a Holliday junction. Center: Next, substrate form a complex with crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease complex for Holliday junction resolution. Right: Finally, completion of Holliday Junction Resolution results in recombinant DNA. Diagram generated based on Wyatt et. al. Crossover junction endodeoxyribonucleases also play key roles in DNA repair. During cell growth and meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) often occur, and are usually repaired by homologous recombination. Because Crossover junction endodeoxyribonucleases perform Holliday Junction resolution, a crucial step of homologous recombination, they are therefore involved in repair of DSBs.  Structure  E. coli RuvC, a Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease, is a small protein of about 20 kD, and its active form is a dimer that requires and binds a magnesium ion [1]. RuvC is a 3-layer alpha-beta sandwich with a beta- sheet between 5 alpha-helices . The enzyme contains two binding channels that contact the backbones of the Holliday junction over seven nucleotides. A Holliday junction resolvase enzyme has also been identified in archaea in Pyrococcus furiosus cells - it is encoded by a gene called hjc and is composed of 123 amino acids . A figure of Thermus thermophilus RuvC in complex with a Holliday junction is shown below. thumbcenterupright=2.0Archaea crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease in complex with Holliday Junction DNA. Generated with 4LD0.pdb.  Mechanism  These enzymes are highly selective for branched DNA, although induced fit occurs in the enzyme-substrate (resolvase-Holloday Junction) complex formation. Much remains unknown about the exact mechanism of action, but it is known that bacteria, bacteriophages and archaea catalyze Holliday junction resolution by introducing symmetric nicks across the Holliday junction . Analysis of crossover junction endodeoxyribonucleases from bacteriophages (T7 endonuclease I), bacteria (RuvC), fungi (GEN1) and humans (hMus81-Eme1) have revealed that the enzymes function in dimers, and part of the resolution reaction takes place in a partially dissociated enzyme-substrate intermediate.  Human Relevance  After a 20 year search, in 2008, a human crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease, GEN1, was finally identified . GEN1 performs similar functions and operates by similar mechanisms as previously studied Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease in bacteria, archaea, and other eukarya. The enzyme is thought to play a role in Bloom's syndrome. It has been proposed that Bloom‚Äôs syndrome involves the induction of DSBs via an unidentified Holliday junction resolvase. It has also been shown that overexpression of Holliday Junction resolvase function is correlated with RAD51-overexpressing cancers.

(2011). Profile of Beatrice Ann Wright. In A. Rutherford (Ed.), Psychology‚Äôs Feminist Voices Multimedia Internet Archive. Retrieved from http://www.feministvoices.com/beatrice-a-wright/ Wright's parents, Jerome and Sonia Posner, were Russian immigrants whose egalitarian and humanistic views would later impact her academic work. The family had a Jewish heritage which Wright reports did not profoundly impact her worldview or growing up years, however, her parents‚Äô avid defense of equality and justice was likely impacted by this heritage. From her parents‚Äô perspective there were two ways to resolve the tension which comes when injustice is present, ‚ÄúOne way is to justify the situation. The other way is to do something about the injustice‚Äù. This would impact Wright who while in high school was expelled from the honors society for distributing leaflets in support of the janitors‚Äô strike, though she would eventually be reinstated at her mother's demand. She died in July 2018 at the age of 100.Beatrice Ann Wright obituary Wright met her husband, Erik, while studying at Brooklyn College. They have three children. She turned 100 in December 2017.https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/323703.die-pionierin-aus-der- arbeitsvermittlung.html  Professional life  After graduating high school at the age of sixteen, Wright went to Brooklyn College where she studied psychology. At Brooklyn College Wright had the opportunity to learn from psychologists such as Solomon Asch and Abraham Maslow, even participating in their experiments. She graduated from Brooklyn College in 1938 and continued her education at the University of Iowa where she would eventually earn both her masters and PhD. At the University of Iowa she studied under the supervision of Kurt Lewin. After earning her PhD she taught at Swarthmore College. During World War II her husband was drafted which led to the family's relocation to California. Wright left her teaching position to be with him and began working in the United States Employment Service. She was given the task of administering the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales and then finding employment for individuals with intellectual disabilities. It was here she would have her first genuine, direct exposure to people with disabilities; this experience would be what launched her into a lifetime of interest in and advocacy for people with disabilities. She worked at the United States Employment Service until 1946 when she left the workplace in order to raise her three children. While being a stay-at-home mother, Wright was contacted by Roger Barker, another former student of Kurt Lewin, to collaborate on a book regarding physical disability on which she agreed to collaborate. She reported that her review of the literature was what would fuel her passion for developing appropriate and culturally responsive ways of working with people with disabilities as the methodology at the time was biased against people with disabilities. This work with Barker would also lead to her husband Erik gaining a teaching position at the University of Kansas, and while he worked at the university she began to work with children who were deaf and their families which again would further her personal and academic interest in people with disabilities. The work with Barker, Adjustment to Physical Handicap and Illness: A Survey of the Social Psychology of Physique and Disability, was a landmark publication both in the field of psychology and in Wright's career. She proceeded to collaborate with many other now notable rehabilitation psychologists such as Tamara Dembo and Gloria Ladieu Leviton on topics related to disability. She also worked with Fritz Heider to produce his famous book on The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations. The Wright family moved to Australia in 1959 when Wright's husband, Erik, received a fellowship from the Fulbright Program. Wright utilized her time in Australia to complete her seminal work on disability and psychology, Physical Disability‚ÄîA Psychological Approach, which would be published in 1960. This work is considered the introduction of disability as a social issue in the field of psychology and its impact continues even today as it has been canonized by the APA as an outstanding twentieth century publication in psychology. This is one way in which Lewin's influence is prominent as she drew heavily from his view of social psychology that all differences in physical appearance provoked the attention by observers.Dunn, D. S., & Elliot, T. R. (2005). Revisiting a constructive classic: Wright's physical disability. Rehabilitation Psychology, 50(2), 183-189. doi: 10.1037/0090-5550.50.2.183/ In 1983 she republished an extensively revised version of the book and retitled it as Physical Disability‚ÄîA Psychosocial Approach to reflect the importance of the interactions with the environment. This work has also been canonized as an outstanding publication by the APA. Wright has received awards for her work including the ‚ÄúDistinguished Alumna Award‚Äù from the University of Iowa as well as the ‚ÄúIrvin Youngberg Award for Achievement in Applied Science‚Äù in 1984, and the ‚ÄúKurt Lewin Award‚Äù from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.  ‚ÄúPhysical Disability ‚Äì A Psychosocial Approach‚Äù  Wright's most prominent work ‚ÄúPhysical Disability ‚Äì A Psychosocial Approach Second Edition‚Äù is wide in scope as it addresses many components of acceptance of physical disability on personal and societal levels. Wright contrasts coping and succumbing as the two frameworks from which one approaches disability.Wright, B. A. (1983). Physical disability: A psychosocial approach. (2nd ed.). New York, NY:Harper & Row Publishers./ She also presents a stage model of psychosocial adjustment to disability, by presenting the four major changes. The four changes are enlargement of scope, subordination of the physique, containment of disability effects, and transformation from comparative to asset values. Enlargement of scope includes the individual recognizing values separate from the disability, the individual will begin to acknowledge areas of skill that are not affected by the disability and while the four changes are not necessarily a phase model, this is typically the first change to occur. A second change Wright dubs the ‚Äúsubordination of the physique‚Äù. In this phase the individual begins to limit the importance of physical appearance as a source of identity; often the person will increase the emphasis on personality or personal traits which are not connected to the disability. The third component is containment of disability effects, which is when the individual views the disability as affecting only the parts of them which it actually affects instead of generalizing any limitations to other areas of the individual. Finally, there is a transformation from comparative to asset values in which the individual ceases using others as a comparison for success of value and focuses more on one's on intrinsic values.

A Critique of Religious Reason is a 2012 book by the Dutch philosopher Herman Philipse, written in English and published in the United Kingdom. Philipse found his Atheist Manifesto (1995) to be too hastily and superficially written, and decided to set up a more complete work to systematically refute all the arguments for the existence of God and adherence to any form of theism. To gain insight in how a religious person substantiates the existence of God, Philipse presents a \\"religious decision tree\\" that leads to four categories of theists. He starts by asking: Is the statement \\"God exists\\" a factual truth claim? # If not, somebody claims that God does not factually exists, but is merely a metaphor. Defenders of this position are, according to Philipse, following the tradition of Wittgenstein, and are currently represented by people like D.Z. Phillips, Problem of Evil and the Problem of God (2005). and Karen Armstrong., The Case for God (2009). # If yes, is it necessary to invoke any kind of (logical) argumentation or (empirical) evidence to back up this truth claim? ## If not, somebody claims that God factually exists, but that one may assert this without invoking any kind of argumentation or evidence. Alvin Plantinga is among those defending this position, aiming to explain the world in the case God exists, which itself remains a matter of faith (an axiom or presupposition, according to Plantinga)., Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism (2011). ## If yes, does this argumentation or evidence need to be scientific in nature (to have gone through the scientific method), and is there no possibility to completely achieve a proof of God through one's own standards? ### If not, somebody claims that God factually exists, and that one can prove this, but not in a scientific manner. Defenders of this position make use of what Philipse calls \\"typically religious arguments\\", such as revelation, religious texts, religious experience, prayer, speaking in tongues, a convulsion with foam at the mouth etc. Although himself an agnostic, the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould described this point of view as non- overlapping magisteria (NOMA):, Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life (1999). science and religion are two entirely different enterprises and have nothing to say about each other; therefore, science cannot assess the existence of God. The opposite of this is the god of the gaps argument, namely that if science can't explain any given phenomenon, religion can, often by postulating a god. ### If yes, somebody claims that God factually exists, and that his existence can be demonstrated using scientific evidence. This position is held by people like Richard Swinburne, The Existence of God (2004). and Stephen D. Unwin,, The Probability of God (2003). who, for example, try to show the probability of God's existence using Bayes' theorem. The intelligent design movement (ID) claimed to possess scientific evidence for the traditional divine creation myth that would refute the theory of evolution (among other scientific facts). Aside from ID, there are many other creationist movements with scientific pretenses. Next, Philipse tries to refute arguments from every category step by step, but especially from the last case, namely Bayes' theorem as used by Swinburne. Based on his critiques of the last two cases (\\"God is supernatural\\" and \\"God's existence is within reach of natural theology\\") he concludes that: # God's existence is a meaningless predicate, according to the definitions of substance dualists and supernaturalists. (See also, theological noncognitivism). # If theism were meaningful, it would have no predictive power upon the existing evidence, because theists render the claim unfalsifiable every time evidence on the contrary is explained away with responses like \\"God works in mysterious ways\\" (See also the problem of evil). Therefore Bayesian arguments are inapplicable. # Therefore, because neither strategy is epistemologically satisfactory, one should conclude that atheism is a more principled position than theism.

Odierno, regionally aligned forces (RAF) provide combatant commands (CCMDs), scalable and tailorable Army capabilities for all requirements, including operational missions, bilateral and multilateral military exercises and security cooperation activities.Defense Security Cooperation Agency Army regional alignment is an organizing principle that improves the Army's ability to provide units and capabilities. Regional alignment provides focus and direction for unit training and preparation. RAFs are drawn from the Army Total Force, which includes active United States Army, the Army National Guard and the United States Army Reserve. Corps and divisions are aligned to ensure joint task force capability to every geographic combatant command (GCC).FM 3-22 Army Support To Security Cooperation Through regional alignment, the Army maintains its war-fighting skills and complements these skills with language, regional expertise and cultural awareness training.  Overview  The 2010 U.S. National Security Strategy calls for strong security partnerships with allies and partners. The defense strategic guidance directs the U.S. military services to strengthen allied and partner relationships and to pursue new partnerships.Sustaining Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense The DOD asserts that regionally aligned, mission-tailored forces play an essential role in the defense strategic guidance, which rebalances forces towards the Asia-Pacific region while maintaining Army commitment to partners in and around the Middle East. Believing that partnerships are fundamental to regional and global security, and to ensure better and faster Army responsiveness to GCC security cooperation and operational requirements, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Raymond T. Odierno, directed the Army to improve its ability to engage regionally with partners while remaining globally responsive. The Army plans to remain capable of fighting and winning America's wars, by ensuring that it ‚Äú‚Ä¶ shall be organized, trained and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained combat incident to operations on land.‚Äù To better accomplish this Congressional directive within a global area of responsibility, DOD claims that regional alignment allows Army Forces to more efficiently organize themselves in strength and composition to best support each geographic combatant commander, and to quickly deploy and sustain operations in support of combatant command requirements. Importantly, DOD expected Army regional alignment to improve the Army's ability to provide soldiers and capabilities to the GCCs, to help support the United States Department of State efforts to promote greater security and stability in regions and countries whose interests share a common vision of freedom and prosperity.Security Sector Reform Following Department of State direction, and at GCC request for training and mentoring capabilities, Army Forces committed to devote resources to helping improve partner capacity to provide security to their populations; to serve as part of United Nations or coalition efforts; and to build stronger military institutions that are accountable to civilian authority and that respect the rule of law. The regionally aligned force concept was to work within U.S. legal authorities established by the United States Congress, the Department of State, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Regional alignment  Some Army formations were regionally and habitually aligned before the new strategic directive. This includes soldiers within the United States Army Special Operations Command and the United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command, Foreign Area Officers and the Army National Guard State Partnership Program. These units have traditionally focused on specific countries and regions. They have either required or encouraged their soldiers to learn the languages of those regions. Some of these persons and units focus on a single region for most of their service. Some units are assigned to a particular GCC, such as 2nd Infantry Division(2ID) and 25th Infantry Division (25ID) to U.S. Pacific Command. Assigned units remain regionally aligned to the same GCC, although Army personnel assigned to them continue the normal rotation cycle. The Army decided to align a brigade to each GCC to provide them with consistent, dedicated and regionally focused Army Forces and capabilities to support their security cooperation and partnering requirements, and to respond more quickly and effectively to a potential crisis or contingency. The brigades were to rotate yearly. The 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team (BCT), 1st Infantry Division (commonly called 2-1ID), stationed in Fort Riley, Kansas, is the first BCT to be aligned to a combatant command, namely Africa Command. Additional brigades were to be aligned in subsequent fiscal years and a corps and/or division was to be aligned to each GCC. Another example is the US Army, Europe. The regionally aligned units to this Command are the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division and the 3rd Infantry Division.  Preparation  Army RAF Forces were expected to receive a basic introduction to the culture and history of their region. Training occurs primarily at a unit's home station through on-line courses, or taught by traveling training teams. This training is important for helping U.S. Army soldiers better appreciate their region, though they were not expected to become regional or linguistic experts. U.S. Army special operations forces have historically worked with U.S. partner nation military forces and was expected to continue to do so. These Army personnel attain a high degree of cultural awareness and language capability and develop specialized, regionally focused areas of expertise. Conventional forces were directed to support the geographic combatant commanders with logistics, maintenance, communication, finance, administration, military rule of law and other services critical for sustaining and maintaining security forces that can participate in multinational operations, who remain answerable to their civilian authorities, and who respect the rule of law.  Employment  As in the past, soldiers will continue to support security cooperation programs of varying size and duration.Building the Capacity of Partner States Through Security Force Assistance They can travel in teams as small two persons to support military- to-military traveling contact teams (M2M TCT) that provide expertise to the host nation in areas such as logistics, intelligence, common core soldier skills such as land navigation and first aid, or critical skills such as communications. The Army could also provide several hundred soldiers to support and participate in military exercises at the request of the host nation. M2M TCTs are generally no longer than five days; exercise support could require some soldiers to remain in country for a month or more; and participation in some U.S. Department of State funded capacity building programs can last longer.  Way ahead  Aligning Army forces with regions allows the integration of planning and training for GCC contingencies, focuses language and cultural training and provides predictable and dependable capabilities to GCC and Army Service Component Command (ASCC) commanders. In addition, the Army expected to consider how to manage, train and develop soldiers to support regional alignment and to ensure appropriate investments.2012 Strategic Army Planning Guidance References External links # 2012 Army Strategic Planning Guidance # Chief of Staff of the Army remarks on Regional Alignment # Association of the United States Army article on Regional Alignment # First Regionally Aligned unit to deploy to Africa # Chief of Staff of the Army Category:Military doctrines Category:United States Army doctrine ","title":"Regionally Aligned Forces"},{"id":"39053200","text":"Glass animal collectibles are tiny blown glass animal figurines that serve as collectibles.

He led a coalition government with PTI as the leading party while Jamaat-e-Islami and Awami Jamhuri Ittehad Pakistan were also a part of it.PTI, JI reach deal on forming KP govt Imran Khan finalises Pervaiz Khattak as next K-P chief minister *Implementation of \\"Right to Information\\" bill in KPK. *Energy Generation. *De-politicization of police. *Online Crime's First Information Report (FIR) System. *People empowerment & developments. *Mobile Courts. *Rehabilitation of drug addicts and IDPs. *Law Enforcement Capability Enhancements. *Upgradation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa electricity distribution system. *Working on Whistleblower law to be implemented in KPK. Relations with the federal government Straight away after assuming office Khattak declared that he will pursue a non- confrontational approach with the Federal Government which is controlled by Nawaz Sharif, he hopes this d√©tente will create a more stable environment for the KPK government to produce results.Will avoid policy of confrontation with federal govt: Khattak However confrontation became inevitable with conflict over direction of the Taliban problem and by October 2013 the provincial government became more independent and assertive from the federal government, threatening to close US Supply lines. Security and terrorism policy Khattak favours peace talks with the Taliban, a policy of the state. During his tenure an anti-terrorism force was set-up. Khattak's government combated drug smugglers as well, many were arrested in raids. Judiciary Khattak supported the judiciary of his province. The mobile court is used to dispense justice and mediate between disputes Electricity policy Khattak gave a 10-year hydro electric plan which will be implemented across the province. He also approved energy conservation plans. He also campaigned to prevent electricity theft in the province of KPK. Pervez Khattak Govt. announced to build 350 numbers mini-micro hydel power projects for the small villages and later seeing the success of the project increased the numbers to 1000 mini- micro hydel projects. The electricity price is as less as PKR 2‚Äì5 per unit (US$0.02‚Äì0.05/kWh). Healthcare Aside from anti-polio campaigns, the Khattak administration introduced drives to increase breast cancer awareness. The Pervez Khattak led KP government also launched,the first of its kind public sector facility in the country, a social health insurance programme for the underprivileged of the province. Through these insurance cards, the disadvantaged will be able to receive medical assistance at both private and public hospitals across the province free of cost. Security policy Nonetheless, he takes a hardline against drone strikes, viewing them as extending extremism and has threatened to block NATO supply lines if drone strikes continue and the Federal Government refuses to prevent them. Following 2 November Drone Strike, a day before peace talks were due to start with the Taliban, Khattak affirmed that he would indeed use his power to push for the blocking of NATO supply lines.

It is situated in the Plaza de Armas de Cusco, the city center. It is built on an Inca palace. It is one of the best examples of Spanish Baroque architecture in Peru. The architecture of this building exerted a great influence on the development of many Baroque architecture in the South Andes. Its construction began in 1576, but it was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1650. The rebuilt church was completed in 1668. History Iglesia de la Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s in 1856 by sir Robert Clements and Clements Markham The construction of the original church was begun in 1576 on the grounds of the old Amarucancha, palace of the Inca Huayna C√°pac that was one of the largest palaces surrounding the main square of Qosqo (the Inca capital). The grounds of this palace were given to Hernando Pizarro. Years later the property was purchased from the heirs of the conquistador by Diego de Silva y Guzm√°n and his wife Teresa Orgo√±ez, who donated it to the Jesuits after their arrival to the city in 1571. In the year 1650, the main church was devastated by the earthquake. This allowed the builders to undertake, the following year, a more ambitious reconstruction. Despite the protests of the council, the work continued according to plan, and the church was reinaugurated in 1668. It was built by the Flemish Jesuit and architect, Jean- Baptiste Gilles (Hispanized name was Juan Bautista Edigiano), the works on the fa√ßade were directed by Diego Mart√≠nez de Oviedo, Oviedo is very likely to follow the plan provided by Gilles. Description Seen from the Plaza Armas de Cusco The main facade is a classic example of the Baroque style. The Jesuit college in Cusco was dedicated the Transfiguration of Christ, and the high altar features a painting of the Transfiguration attributed to the Jesuit Diego de la Puente. The most notable piece of art in the church is a painting depicting the wedding of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a de Loyola, the nephew of Ignatius Loyola with Beatriz, the great-niece of the Inca ruler Tupac Amaru. In the church, there are paintings and sculptures by Diego de la Puente, Marcos Zapata, and Cristo de Burgos. Portal The portal, a \\"altarpiece\\" type, presents towers of medium height and its stone walls have been carefully worked. Its towers appear divided into two sections, leaving the lower one free of all decoration, while the upper part has two \\"balconies\\" with projecting ledges. At the start of the bell towers, a large flown cornice joins the towers to the front, curving in a trilobed form on the top of it. Finally, the tall body of the towers has a square plan, its portholes, the octagonal dome and the pinnacles, around, define the typical profile of the Cusco bell towers. Interior Detail of the large painting The Wedding of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a O√±as de Loyola with Do√±a √ëusta Beatriz Clara Qoya, ca. 17th- century, anonymous painter (Cusco School). It is located inside. Similar sumptuousness is seen in the carved tribunes and the rest of the altarpieces, some of which belonged to the defunct Templo de San Agust√≠n. The collection of sculptures and paintings within are noteworthy. The church exhibits, under the choir of the main altar, works of art by Marcos Zapata and his assistant Cipriano Guti√©rrez. On both sides of the main gate of the main altar, around the alabaster windows (huamanga), there are two canvases that represent the life of St. Ignatius of Loyola: in one he is healing the sick and in the other he is victorious over the heretics and schismatics of the Reformation. The interior also hosts two paintings of great historical value. The first, located on the northern wall, is The Wedding of Mart√≠n Garc√≠a O√±as de Loyola with Do√±a √ëusta Beatriz Clara Qoya, which depicts the union of this Spanish captain, nephew of St. Ignatius of Loyola (who is founder of the Society of Jesus) and apprehender of the last Incas of T√∫pac Amaru, and the √±usta of Inca lineage, daughter of Sayri T√∫pac and therefore niece of T√∫pac Amaru. This noble indigenous woman, Beatriz Clara, was heiress of the Lordship of Yucay. Their mestiza daughter, √±usta Lorenza de Loyola Qoya, was the first Marquiss of Santiago de Oropesa, the nobiliary title that granted claim to all the properties of the Yucay Valley and the surrounding Oropesa, with the power to rule them with complete independence of the local authorities. This daughter married Juan de Borja y Enr√≠quez de Luna, son of St. Francis Borgia. Also on the canvas are T√∫pac Amaru and Sayri T√∫pac, who, like the princess, wear native clothes; behind them appears the achiwa, a kind of umbrella made of multicolored bird feathers and used only by the Inca. The second painting is on the south wall and represents the wedding of Beltr√°n Garc√≠a de Loyola with Teresa Idi√°quez, daughter of Juan Idi√°quez and Magdalena de Loyola. Chapel of San Ignacio de Loyola Altarpiece The chapel of San Ignacio de Loyola is located to the south, and adjacent to that is the central location of the modern-day National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco. That building originally served the Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, which was part of the University of the Transfiguration, created by Pope Gregory XV in 1621. After the Jesuits were expelled in 1767, the site served as the army barracks and prison of Jos√© Gabriel Condorcanqui (T√∫pac Amaru II). At the end of the 19th century it housed the Society of Artisans. The chapel is small and austere, with a single nave built in stone, and has a more sober portal than that of the main church. It is currently an exhibition hall. University Complete facade Church of la Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s in 1868. New York Public Library Next to their church, the Jesuits built their own university: the University of San Ignacio de Loyola, now the premises of the National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot. Paradoxically, the two institutions were major rivals at the end of the 17th century. The stone fa√ßade dates from that time, but its treatment is much freer than that of the main church. Its composition, like an altarpiece, is adorned with a profuse padding and with blind, purely decorative windows. Its wide hall, crowned by a dome, is unique in Cusco. The inner cloister, which contains an austere stone arcade, served as a model for others in the city. It houses the Museum of Natural Sciences. The Seminary of San Antonio de Abad was founded in 1598 in a building on the Calle de las Nazarenas (today the Hotel Monasterio); In 1692, through a document given by Pope Innocent XII, the University of Saint Anthony the Abbot was created on its base. Chapel of Loreto To the left of their church, the Jesuits built this chapel for indigenous peoples between 1651 and 1654. Like the previous one, it is set further back from the square than the main church, and its sober decoration does not compete with the main building. The interior of this chapel does not retain anything of the original decor.

Because of her provocative art and public appearances, she was seen as representative of bohemian Greenwich Village and thus known as \\"The Queen of Greenwich Village.\\"  Early life  According to herself and The New York Times, in 1908 Tice was the first woman in Greenwich Village to bob her hair. Around the same time, Tice was able to study under the famous artist and teacher Robert Henri. In 1910, Henri and some of his artist friends, organized the first exhibition of Independent Artist. This art show, which was with its jury-free and no-awards concept quite a revolution at that time and thus received enormous attention, was financially backed by Tice and featured her works.  Immersion in the arts  A few years later, namely in 1915, Tice's fame skyrocketed when Anthony Comstock, main founder of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, tried to confiscate Tice's art at the well-known bohemian restaurant Polly's. Thereafter images of Tice's artworks and photos of the artist were featured in magazines such as Vanity Fair, Rogue, The Blind Man, and Cartoons magazine. During that time she had several one-person exhibitions and also worked on numerous other projects, for example, she created posters for bohemian costume balls and played herself in the 1922 version of the Greenwich Village Follies. During those years, Tice not only played an important part in Greenwich Village's colorful art scene, but also joined the Arensberg Circle in their uptown location. It was probably Marcel Duchamp who introduced Tice to Walter and Louise Arensberg and their salon. There she met Henri-Pierre Roch√©, with whom she spent several evenings. Tice also participated in two projects by the Arensberg Circle: first, two of her works were shown in the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists and second, one of her works was featured in The Blind Man. During the 1920s, she illustrated about a dozen books with her erotic images, these are nowadays expensive collector's items. In 1940, her own book called ABC Dogs was published. It is a children's book in which each letter of the alphabet is represented by a dog breed whose name starts with the same letter. This publication sparked renewed interest in Tice and her art. She also worked on her memoirs, which she never completed.

The Interaction Flow Modeling Language (IFML) is a standardized modeling language in the field of software engineering. IFML includes a set of graphic notations to create visual models of user interactions and front-end behavior in software systems. The Interaction Flow Modeling Language was developed in 2012 and 2013 under the lead of WebRatio and was inspired by the WebML notation, as well as by a few other experiences in the Web modeling field. It was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) in March 2013. Focus IFML supports the platform independent description of graphical user interfaces for applications accessed or deployed on such systems as desktop computers, laptop computers, PDAs, mobile phones, and tablets. The focus of the description is on the structure and behavior of the application as perceived by the end user. IFML describes user interactions and control behaviors of front-end of applications belonging to the following domains: * HTML+HTTP based Web applications. * Rich Internet Applications, as supported by the HTML 5 standard. * Mobile applications. * Client-server applications. * Desktop applications. * Embedded Human Machine Interfaces for control applications. * Multichannel and context-aware applications. IFML does not cater to the specification of bi-dimensional and tri-dimensional computer based graphics. IFML does not apply to the modeling of presentation issues (layout/look and feel) of an application front-end or to the design of business logic and data components. Although these aspects are not the focus of the language, IFML allows designers to reference external models or modeling artifacts regarding these aspects from within IFML models. Content of the standard The IFML specification consists of: * The IFML metamodel (MOF). * The IFML UML profile. * The IFML visual syntax (Defined through Diagram Definition and Diagram Interchange specification). * The IFML XMI model exchange format. Main modeling concepts Main IFML concepts and notations. An IFML model consists of one or more view containers (possibly nested). For example, windows in traditional desktop applications or page templates in Web applications. A view container can contain view components, which denote the publication of static or dynamic content, or interface elements for data entry (such as input forms). A view component can have input and output parameters. A view container and a view component can be associated with events, that can represent users' interactions or system-generated occurrences. For example, an event for selecting one or more items from a list or for submitting inputs from a form. The effect of an event is represented by an interaction flow connection. The interaction flow expresses a change of state of the user interface. An event can also trigger an action, which is executed prior to updating the state of the user interface; for example, a delete or update operation on instances of a database. An input-output dependency between elements can be specified through parameter bindings associated with navigation flows or through data flows, that only describe data transfer. IFML also includes concepts for defining constraints, modularization, and context awareness (e.g., based on user profile, device, location) over modeling elements. IFML concepts can be extended with standard extension mechanisms based on stereotyping. Benefits The cost of front-end application development has increased with the emergence of an unprecedented range of devices, technological platforms, and communication channels, which are not accompanied by the advent of an adequate approach for creating a Platform Independent Model (PIM) that can be used for designing user interactions independently of the implementation platform. This causes front- end development to be a costly and inefficient process, where manual coding is the predominant development approach, reuse of design artifacts is low, and portability of applications across platforms remains difficult. IFML brings several benefits to the development of application front-ends: * It supports the formal specification of the front-end from different perspectives: interface composition, user interaction, event management. * It supports connection with the business logic, the data model, and the graphical presentation layer. * It isolates the specification of the front-end from implementation-specific issues. * It improves the development process, by fostering the separation of concerns between roles in the interaction design. * It enables the communication of UI design to non-technical stakeholders.A Foundation For a perfect UI Design by CitrusBits (March 20, 2015) Implementations and tools IFML is currently supported by WebRatio . A set of blog posts describing the standardization process is available here. A new, opensource IFML editor based on Eclipse, EMF/GMF and the Graphiti API is under development. The tool will be released as an open-source Eclipse Project. The tool will include mappings from IFML abstract concepts to the platform- specific concepts of Java Swing, Microsoft WPF, and HTML. The modeling of the IFML diagrams for the UI part can be complemented with (executable) UML diagrams according to fUML specifications combined with Alf scripts for the back-end business logic. A sneak preview of the tool features can be seen in this video. IFMLEdit.org is a web-based opensource IFML editor focused on education and agile development. It supports model editing, code generation and emulation. Currently it supports the generation of code for server side NodeJS, client side JavaScript and mobile applications via Cordova or Flutter. History IFML was inspired by the WebML notation, invented at Politecnico di Milano by Stefano Ceri and Piero Fraternali, with a team of people including Roberto Acerbis, Aldo Bongio, Marco Brambilla, Sara Comai, Stefano Butti and Maristella Matera.

The work was completed in 1889 and is held at the New Orleans Museum of Art. Background William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825‚Äì1905) was a French academic artist who began his career at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris with depictions of Classical myths and legends, but soon came into demand in France and the United States for portraiture and decorative works. Although his work was ridiculed by contemporary artists such as Edgar Degas and Vincent van Gogh as overly finished and soft, Bouguereau was granted lavish praise during his lifetime, including multiple awards at the Salon de Paris. Of his highly polished, idealistic style, in which he used models with porcelain-like skin and depicted provincial themes, Bouguereau said \\"There's only one kind of painting. It's the painting that presents the eye with perfection, the kind of beautiful and impeccable enamel you find in Veronese and Titian.\\" Description Premi√®re r√™verie, which measures 157.48 x 92.71 cm (62 x 36 1/2 in), features a young woman sitting on rock with a vase beneath her arm and a Cupid whispering into her ear. The model for this painting, whose identity is unknown, also featured in Bouguereau's Boucles d'oreilles (1889‚Äì90), Le Travail interrompu (1891; Mead Art Museum), and Daphnis et Chloe. Legacy and provenance Bouguereau completed Premi√®re r√™verie in early 1889, naming it Le chant de l'Amour (The Song of Love). In May of that year the work was sold to the art dealership Tooth and Sons and renamed Premi√®re r√™verie. That August the dealership sold the painting to a person named Groves. The painting was later gifted to the New Orleans Museum of Art by Mr. and Mrs. Chapman H. Hyams; the museum's catalogue lists it as Whisperings of Love. Eyewitness Books' guide to New Orleans lists the painting as one of the top ten exhibits at the museum, and Christie's considers the work one of Bouguereau's more important contemporary paintings. In late 1889, Gustave Doyen, with some input from the Bouguereau, completed a reduction of Premi√®re r√™verie; this work, measuring , is now housed at the Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens. A print of Bougureau's painting, produced by John Douglas Miller, is held at the Art Institute of Chicago under the title The First Whisper of Love; this title had previously been attached to the reduction when it was sold by Tooth and Sons. In the catalogue raisonn√© for Bouguereau, Premi√®re r√™verie has number 1889/06, whereas the reduction is listed as number 1889/06A.

Van Camp (25 December 1814 ‚Äì 4 April 1900) was an Indianapolis businessman who founded the Van Camp canning company. Life He was born in Brookville, Indiana, to Charles and Mary (Halstead) Van Camp. His father was a farmer and wagon maker. In 1844 he married Mary Ann Gregg, who died five years later. In 1850 he married Hester Jane Raymond (19 July 1828-November 1912), the daughter of Thomas and Amy (Fluelling) Raymond, a farming family in Franklin County. They had nine children, five of whom survived infancy: Mary, Cortland (25 May 1852 ‚Äì 7 August 1923), Clara (November 1858-December 1943), George (d. 1926), and Frank (1864-1937). As a young man he professed Methodism, later switching to Presbyterianism. He was a founding organizer of the Fifth Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis in October, 1867, but in 1890 it voted to become a Congregational church and he moved to the Second Presbyterian Church.Reed, George Irving, ed. (1899) Encyclopedia of Biography of Indiana. Vol. II, Chicago: Century Publishing and Engraving, pp. 54-6. He died in Indianapolis, and is buried in the Crown Hill Cemetery there. Business beginnings When he was 17 he went to work at a flour mill near his home and learned the trade of miller. At the end of four years he opened a store selling tinware and stoves with a partner. Van Camp learned the trade of tinsmithing, making much of the merchandise he sold at the Brookville store. After four years he sold his interest and from 1845 to 1860 he worked as a tinsmith around Greensburg. In 1861 he went to Indianapolis and with Martin Williams and Calvin Fletcher, a fruit grower and a financier, built a cold storage warehouse to store fruits, meats, and other perishables. In 1862 he expanded into canning raspberries, blackberries, peaches and tomatoes in six- gallon cans.

In 1868 the business moved into larger quarters, where it continued canning tomatoes, peaches and berries. In 1877 or 1878 the name of the packing house was changed to G. C. Van Camp & Son.

In 1891 a fire wiped out the business and the Van Camps began again, but in 1894 the country went through an economic depression, causing Van Camp to search for something more substantial than the limited pack vegetable market on which to build a permanent business. Pork and beans Early can label, c. 1900 In 1894 an Indianapolis jobber brought a load of canned baked beans to the Van Camp plant to have them reprocessed. At lunch time, Frank Van Camp, the founder's son, opened a can from the jobbing house to eat with his lunch. The flavor of the beans was flat, so to make them more palatable he added some Van Camps' ketchup, originating \\"Van Camp's Pork and Beans with Tomato Sauce.\\" The first sale was for a car load delivered in Pittsburgh.McPhetridge, Lannes. \\"Rise of the Van Camps.\\" Printer's Ink, 14 October 1908, 65: 3, pp. 3-7; p. 4. In December 1894 the Van Camps placed a small want ad in the Indianapolis News seeking house-to-house canvassers to sell cans of pork and beans, to which 300 responded. The next year the company sold 67,030 cases of beans. The company began advertising in several cities with street car cards, outdoor signs and three-sheet posters. In 1896 magazine advertisements began running in national magazines, and a strongly organized sales force was dispatched in the field.McPhetridge 1908, pp. 4, 6. In 1898 the company used 6 million tin cans for its operation.Reed 1899, p. 55.

He was certified in medical genetics by the American Board of Medical Genetics and a founding fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics. He was a human geneticist interested in discovering the location of human genes that cause disease, specifically the mapping of Mendelian and complex inherited diseases including the study of Huntington's disease, genetics of alcoholism, diabetes and manic depressive illness. In collaboration with researchers from Columbia University and James F. Gusella of Harvard University, he was the first to use DNA techniques to map a human gene. In the past twenty years he has helped map approximately 20 human genes and his work has resulted in the identification of 20% of the human genome. Conneally received his bachelor's degree in Agriculture with Honors from University College Dublin in 1954 and Master‚Äôs and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Conneally‚Äôs research interests were in the mapping of Mendelian and complex inherited diseases including the study of Huntington's disease, genetics of alcoholism, diabetes and manic depressive illness.

Following graduation, he worked as an agriculture instructor in west of Ireland advising farmers. He decided to obtain a master's degree and was prompted to travel to the United States to obtain the degree by faculty in the Department of Agriculture at University College Dublin. Many of his aunts and uncles had migrated to the United States and settled in Chicago, Illinois, prompting him to choose a school close by. He went to the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1958 and graduated with his Master's and Ph.D. in Medical Genetics in 1962 under direction of Newton Morton, an epidemiological geneticist, when James F. Crow was chairman of the Department of Medical Genetics. Conneally then spent two years at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland with Arthur Steinberg and worked with Hutterites, a genetic isolate in the western United States and Canada. He then came to the Indiana University School of Medicine in 1964 where he was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine on a tenure track. Approximately two years after arriving at Indiana, the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics was created with Conneally as one of the first professors in the department under Don Merritt. Dr. Conneally died on February 17, 2017. Honors He served as President of the American Society of Human Genetics, Secretary General of the World Federation on Neurology‚Äôs Section on Huntington‚Äôs Disease and was a member of the World Trade Center and Hurricane Katrina DNA Identification Committees.

In 1972, his parents divorced and his father remarried to Joan Benjamin who had two children from a previous marriage: Scott (born 1963) and Stacy (born 1965). Robins was greatly influenced by his father who worked extensively in Miami Beach and raised Craig and his three siblings on Star Island. Robins attended the University of Barcelona in 1982 and credits his time as a student in Spain for inspiring his passion for art, design and architecture. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1984 and graduated from the University of Miami School of Law in 1987. Career In 1986, he was approached by New York real estate developers Tony Goldman and Mark Soyka who wanted to renovate the storied but run-down Park Central Hotel on Ocean Drive in Miami Beach. Robins represented his father at the meeting which devolved into a discussion about renovating South Beach. (Robins states that Goldman was \\"the second big influence on my career, after my father.\\") In 1987, Robins branching out on his own, formed Dacra Development, Inc. and started to purchase and develop South Beach real estate. In 1988, he formed Dacra Construction and his brother Scott also got into real estate forming a separate company, Scott Robins Companies, Inc. which partnered with Craig's company. Robins brokered a compromise between developers and preservationists over expanding Miami Beach's Art Deco Historic District which helped establish his reputation as a preservationist. In the early years of his career, Robins was mentored by his then-business partner Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records.Chris Blackwell Together, they renovated a number of properties on South Beach which were repositioned as Island Outpost hotels. Those properties included the Netherland, the Leslie, the Kent, the Cavalier and the Marlin, which was widely credited as igniting the renaissance of the area. In 1992, they purchased with their father for $8.5 million the Cavalier, the Cardozo, the Carlyle, the Leslie, and the Victor hotels from the creditors of developer Leonard Pelullo. Robins‚Äô next important mentor was real estate developer Tony Goldman, who was largely credited for the revitalization of NYC‚Äôs Soho. In 1997, Robins bought Chalk's Airlines and renamed it Pan Am Air Bridge; he sold it in 1998. In 1999, Dacra acquired 8.5 acres on the southern tip of Allison Island and created AQUA, a New Urbanist community featuring modern architecture, design and site-specific public art. The private residential community of 46 homes on Allison Island designed by ten different architecture firms with a master plan by Duany Plater-Zyberk and public art projects including a 100-foot mural by Richard Tuttle.Sun Sentinel \\"Echoes of Deco Renovation...\\", 1/3/93Guardian \\"Robins' nest\\", 11/8/08 It is now an international model for development.Boom or Bust: Miami \\"Craig Robins: Revolutionary Development\\", 6/15/07 Thereafter, Robins focused on reviving Miami‚Äôs Design District.NY Times \\"Miami's Design District Looks For An Upgrade\\", 1/25/13 In 2005, Robins launched the first Design Miami collectible design fair in the Design District alongside Art Basel.

Currently, he has built a collection of over 1,000 objects, a selection of artworks are on public display at the Dacra headquarters and are rotated annually. Exhibits at Dacra often feature works by artists John Baldessari, Richard Tuttle, Kai Althoff, Rirkrit Tiravanija and Nicole Eisenman. An extension of the art collection can be found in Robins development projects. Artist Richard Tuttle received his first public art commission from Robins for the Aqua at Allison Island project. Additional public art pieces at Aqua include ‚ÄúAquarelle‚Äù by Guillermo Kuitca and ‚ÄúFreebird‚Äù by Mark Handforth, both of whom have works in the collection. Robins also loaned a selection of two-dimensional works from his personal collection to various sites at Aqua. In the Miami Design District, John Baldessari was asked by Robins to create two murals for City View Garage and a mural by artist Gabriel Orozco covers two-walls at the entrance to the office suites at Dacra. Awards Robins is frequently listed among the top collectors of contemporary art and design. He has received numerous awards for his leadership and philanthropy including: * 2006 Design Patron Award from the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. Presented to Robins at the White House by the First Lady, the award recognizes an individual‚Äôs patronage of design within the business and civic sectors. * 2011 Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award. Selected by an international jury, the award honors exemplary patrons of art, architecture, design and culture in civic, institutional, educational and commercial contexts.

Dorrough (born January 1942), American inventor and audio engineer generally regarded as the ‚Äúfather of multi-band processing.‚Äù He is the founder of Dorrough Electronics and inventor of the Discriminate Audio Processor (DAP) in 1973, and the Dorrough Loudness Monitor. While the DAP product instantly changed audio processing in the broadcast world, the company is best known for its award-winning ‚Äúeyebrow‚Äù scale audio loudness monitors in widespread use throughout the motion picture, recording and broadcast industries worldwide.  Biography  Born in San Francisco. Began his career as a recording engineer in 1963 at Casey Kasam and Bob Hudson‚Äôs Emperor Productions. While focusing on recording, he maintained working relationships with several of the Los Angeles radio stations, bridging the gap between the two mediums, which enabled him to experiment with audio processing. Later at RCA, he continued his research on his theory that audio processing should be directed toward perceived power and not on amplitude alone. The first composite tri-band processor was incorporated into the recording sessions of such artists as Jefferson Airplane and Carol Burnett. In 1970 Dorrough Electronics was formed to market this product. Always aware of the inconsistencies in the metering of program levels, he realized that to maintain consistent listening levels that there must be a relationship between the peak and the average content, and that both should be displayed on a common scale. His development of a LED meter displaying both peak and average ballistics with dual reference points is used for audio program level indications throughout the world. Dorrough is a native of Los Angeles and lives in Woodland Hills, California. He is married and has five children. He has always been an avid collector of early broadcast equipment and recordings and maintains a large collection.

Following the end of World War II, U.S. forces landed within the present-day South Korea to accept the surrender of the Japanese, and help create an independent and unified Korean government with the help of the Soviet Union, which occupied the present-day North Korea. However, when this effort proved unsuccessful, the United States and the Soviet Union both established their own friendly governments, resulting in the current division of the Korean Peninsula. Background The partition of Korea into occupation zones was proposed in August 1945, by the United States to the Soviet Union following the latter's entry in the war against Japan. The 38th parallel north was chosen to separate the two occupation zones on August 10 by two American officers, Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel, working on short notice and with little information on Korea. Their superiors endorsed the partition line and the proposal was accepted by the Soviets. The Americans hoped to establish a representative government supportive of American policy in the region, and the Soviets hoped to establish another communist nation friendly to their interests. Occupation The flag lowering ceremony in Seoul during the official Japanese surrender of Korea on September 9, 1945 The American occupation force composed of 45,000 men from the United States Army's XXIV Corps. The first of the American forces to arrive in Korea was a small advanced party that landed at Kimpo Airfield near Seoul on September 4, 1945. Another small advanced party, consisting of fourteen men of the 7th Infantry Division, sailed into Inchon on September 8, and the main landing began on the following day. According to author Paul M. Edwards, the United States government had little interest in Korea, and relied on General Douglas MacArthur, who was in command of the occupation of Japan, to make most of the post-war decisions. MacArthur, however, was already \\"overloaded\\" with the work that needed to be done in Japan, so he ordered the commander of Operation Blacklist Forty, Lieutenant General John R. Hodge, to maintain a \\"harsh\\" occupation of Korea. Hodge set up his headquarters at the Banda Hotel in Seoul, established a military government, declared English to be the official language of Korea, and began the process of building an independent Korean government that was friendly to the United States. Hodge was considered a great battlefield commander, but a poor diplomat. There is little doubt he disliked Koreans, and was ignorant of their culture and how it differed from that of the Japanese. As a result, Hodge made many mistakes, including issuing an order to his men to \\"treat the Koreans as enemies.\\" Furthermore, due to a shortage of manpower, Hodge allowed the old Japanese police force to remain on duty for crowd control and similar work. He also retained the colonial Japanese government, at least initially, until he could find suitable American replacements. However, following a complaint from the Korean people, the American military government in Tokyo officially had Korea removed from Japan's political and administrative control on October 2, 1945. Thus, the Japanese administrators were removed from power, although many were henceforth employed as advisors to their American replacements. Edwards says that General Hodge's most significant contribution to the occupation was the alignment of his military government with that of Korea's wealthy anti-Communist faction, and the promotion of men who had previously collaborated with the Japanese into positions of authority. Author E. Takemae says that the American forces were greeted as occupiers, and not as liberators. He also says that the Americans held the Japanese in higher regard than the Koreans, because of the former's military background, and appreciated Japanese knowledge and administrative skills, which they did not find among the Koreans. As it turned out, the Americans found that it was easier to deal with Japanese authorities in regards to the handling of Korea, instead of dealing directly with Korea's many different political factions. According to Takemae; \\"[I]n the eyes of many Koreans, the Americans were as bad as the Japanese.\\" USS San Francisco off the Korean coast on September 28, 1945 Preparations for the withdrawal of American and Soviet forces from the Korean Peninsula could not begin until the United States and the Soviets could agree to establish a unified Korean government friendly to both nations' interests. However, the Soviets refused to accept any idea that did not involve the creation of a communist state, and therefore the negotiations were fruitless. As result of this disagreement, the United States sent the \\"Korean question\\" to the United Nations (UN). The UN agreed to take up the challenge in September 1947, and proceeded with providing the Koreans with UN-supervised elections. The Soviet Union, however, made it clear that any decision made by the UN would only apply to the portion of Korea south of the 38th parallel, and that anything north of the parallel would be determined by either itself or the new Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Nevertheless, the elections were held, and the exiled Korean leader, Syngman Rhee, was inaugurated president of the new Republic of Korea (South Korea) on July 24, 1948. The American and Soviet occupations of Korean ended soon after, leaving the Korean peninsula divided. According to Edwards, most Americans were glad to be gone. By 1950, Korea, or Far Eastern affairs in general, had become of such small importance to the Americans that on January 5, 1950, President Harry Truman said that he would not intervene in the clash between the Chinese Communists and the Nationalists on Taiwan, or on the Chinese mainland, and seven days later Secretary of State Dean Acheson said that \\"Korea was now outside the American sphere of influence.\\" Despite this, the United States and South Korea signed a military assistance pact on January 26, 1950, but only $1,000 worth of signal wire had arrived in country by the time of the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950.

The area is part of the Elgin Wine of Origin district and is home to several celebrated wine estates. The distillery is open to the public by appointment.  History   Ren√© Santhagens  275x275px The distillery was established by Ren√© van Eibergen Santhagens, born in Batavia in 1864. He was adventurer, explorer, cavalry officer and chemical engineer. Ren√© became passionate about wine and brandy after a stay in France on the estate of the Marquis de Pellerin Latouche in Cognac. It was here that he fell in love with the Marquis' daughter, Jeanne de Pellerin de la Fouche, whom he later married. In 1897, he answered an advertisement for a distiller in the South African Republic (later the Transvaal Province). Alois Hugo Nellmapius had obtained a concession from President Paul Kruger to erect a distillery near Pretoria. To ensure high quality standards, the distillery had advertised the position to cognac makers. Thus it was that Santhagens arrived on the goldfields of the Witwatersrand, with his own curvaceous alembic copper pot stills in tow. The distillery was a success, but production was halted during the South African war, and was abandoned thereafter. In 1903 Ren√© moved to the Cape and shortly afterwards Jeanne, his wife-to-be, arrived with her father, the Marquis. By this time he had convinced most of the wine farmers of the area that his distillation methods were superior. In 1909, Santhagens purchased a farm called Oude Molen in Stellenbosch, in the shadow of the Papegaaiberg mountain. In time, Santhagens revamped the simple, single storey tin-roofed house into a double-storey mansion with a thatched roof and gable. The fashionable couple became prominent figures in Stellenbosch and Cape society.275x275px  Oude Molen  At Oude Molen, Santhagens started production of his brandies in 1910 and became the first distiller in South Africa to use the cognac-method exclusively. His commitment to quality is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that his bedroom was directly linked with the distillery via a specially- constructed catwalk. The \\"Santy's\\" brand soon became the benchmark of quality. His French motto read Touchant Toujours le But (\\"Always hitting the mark\\") and his emblem was a shield depicting a parrot pierced by an arrow. Both the emblem and the motto still grace the original manor house in Stellenbosch and also the Oude Molen Distillery in Grabouw. The arrow-pierced parrot is a nod to archery competitions held in Stellenbosch, which featured painted wooden parrots as targets. These competitions took place at the foot of the Papegaaiberg (\\"Parrot Mountain\\") not far from the Santhagens homestead.  Legacy  275x275pxHis commitment to the cognac method of distillation and maturation gained him a national reputation for superior brandy. Santhagens was instrumental in framing the legislation that became the Wine and Spirits Act of 1924, which promulgated strict criteria for brandy distillation. When the Act came into effect, Sanghagens was the only person who had a supply of brandy that met all of its criteria. Santhagens died in 1937, but his legacy of remains firmly established in the South African brandy industry, which is subject to some of the most stringent production legislation in the world.  A new chapter  In 2003, Oude Molen relocated to its present site in the Elgin Valley, where legendary distiller Dave Acker had established a distillery a number of years before. The distillery was extensively renovated and modernized to become the new home of Oude Molen Cape Brandy.  The Distillery  275x275px The distillery is located on a 12.6 hectare property, which includes a dam fed by spring water directly from the Nuweberg Mountains. Chenin blanc and colombard vineyards are planted behind the facility, on the bank of the Swannie River. The building retains its rustic charm despite being part of a modern complex, with some of the roofs of the maturation cellars still supported by the original gum poles that were put in place when the first buildings were erected on the site in 1942. Oude Molen houses the three biggest pot stills in South Africa - Big Bertha, Long Tom and Long Cecil. Made entirely of copper, the stills are more than a century old and are renowned for the freshness and purity of the spirit they yield. Several cavernous maturation chambers contain thousands of barrels of maturing spirit. The high humidity in the Elgin Valley makes it particularly suitable for this purpose, as the amount of alcohol lost to evaporation is limited. The distillery is family-owned and the current Brandy Master is Kobus Gelderblom.  Products  Oude Molen is a member of the Cape Brandy Distillers Guild and uses the descriptor \\"Cape Brandy\\" to indicate that its brandies are 100% pot-distilled and matured in oak casks. The Cape Brandy descriptor is increasingly being used by South African distillers as an indicator of quality and provenance. Three variants of Oude Molen Cape Brandy are currently produced. 242x242px Oude Molen VS Cape Brandy Matured for a minimum of three years and featuring a sherry-cask finish. Bottled at 40% alcohol by volume. Oude Molen VSOP Cape Brandy Matured for a minimum of five years in a combination of French and American oak. Bottled at 40% alcohol by volume.

Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which are metadata that the server sends back to the client. This can be information about the server software, what options the service supports, a welcome message or anything else that the client can find out before interacting with the server. Shodan collects data mostly on web servers (HTTP/HTTPS ‚Äì ports 80, 8080, 443, 8443), as well as FTP (port 21), SSH (port 22), Telnet (port 23), SNMP (port 161), IMAP (ports 143, or (encrypted) 993), SMTP (port 25), SIP (port 5060), and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP, port 554). The latter can be used to access webcams and their video stream.Shodan: The IoT search engine for watching sleeping kids and bedroom antics It was launched in 2009 by computer programmer John Matherly, who, in 2003, conceived the idea of searching devices linked to the Internet. The name Shodan is a reference to SHODAN, a character from the System Shock video game series. Background The website began as Matherly's pet project, based on the fact that large numbers of devices and computer systems are connected to the Internet. Shodan has since been used to find systems including control systems for water plants, power grids and a cyclotron. Media coverage In May 2013, CNN Money released an article detailing how Shodan can be used to find dangerous systems on the Internet, including traffic light controls. They show screenshots of those systems, which provided the warning banner \\"DEATH MAY OCCUR !!!\\" upon connecting. In September 2013, Shodan was referenced in a Forbes article claiming it was used in order to find the security flaws in TRENDnet security cameras. The next day, Forbes followed up with a second article talking about the types of things that can be found using Shodan. This included Caterpillar trucks whose onboard monitoring systems were accessible, heating and security control systems for banks, universities, and corporate giants, surveillance cameras, and fetal heart monitors. In January 2015, Shodan was discussed in a CSO Online article addressing its pros and cons. According to one opinion, presented in the article as that of Hagai Bar-El, Shodan actually gives the public a good service, although it highlights vulnerable devices. This perspective is also described in one of his essays. In December 2015, various news outlets, including Ars Technica, reported that a security researcher used Shodan to identify accessible MongoDB databases on thousands of systems, including one hosted by Kromtech, the developer of the MacOS security tool MacKeeper. Usage The website crawls the Internet for publicly accessible devices, concentrating on SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems. Shodan currently returns 10 results to users without an account and 50 to those with one. If users want to remove the restriction, they are required to provide a reason and pay a fee. The primary users of Shodan are cybersecurity professionals, researchers and law enforcement agencies. While cybercriminals can also use the website, some typically have access to botnets that could accomplish the same task without detection. Popular culture Shodan was featured on the American drama series Mr. Robot in October 2017.

Developing as a tropical depression on October 18 near Palau, Hester gradually intensified as it moved westward towards the Philippines. Across the Philippines, Hester was responsible for six deaths and ‚Ç±5 million in damage. After passing over Mindanao and the Visayas as a tropical storm between October 20 and 21, the storm intensified into a typhoon before striking Palawan. Once over the South China Sea, Hester further strengthened and ultimately attained peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). On October 23, the storm made landfall near Hu·∫ø, South Vietnam. Once onshore, Hester rapidly weakened and dissipated on October 24 over Laos. The most significant impact from Typhoon Hester was felt in South Vietnam, where winds in excess of 155 km/h (100 mph) caused extensive damage to several United States Army bases. The hardest hit base was in Chu Lai where three Americans were killed. At least 75 percent of the structures in the base sustained damage and 123 aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Newspaper reports indicated that 100 Vietnamese lost their lives due to the storm, including 33 following a plane crash near Quy Nh∆°n. In the wake of the storm, the South Vietnamese government provided the hardest hit areas with relief funds and supplies. Meteorological history On October 18, a tropical depression formed just west of Palau. Tracking westward, the system attained tropical storm-force winds the following day and was assigned the name Hester. At this time, Hester was located approximately 400 km (250 mi) east of northern Mindanao in the Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goying. Early on October 20, Hester brushed northern Mindanao before crossing the Visayas. The storm passed approximately 75 km (45 mi) south of Cebu City later that day before moving into the South China Sea. Early on October 21, Hester intensified into a typhoon hours before crossing Palawan. Once over the South China Sea, a strong ridge built over southern China resulting in Hester turning northwestward and accelerating. It reached a forward speed of 33 km/h (20 mph), twice the climatological average for typhoons in that region during October. Between October 22 and 23, the storm developed an eye before reaching its peak intensity as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak winds to have reached 165 km/h (105 mph) along with a central pressure of 967 mb (hPa; 28.56 inHg). Hester subsequently made landfall near Hu·∫ø, South Vietnam. Once onshore, the storm's structure rapidly degraded as it weakened. The storm later dissipated over central Laos on October 24. Impact and aftermath South Vietnam The hangar of the 174th Assault Helicopter Company in Chu Lai was leveled along with about twelve Dolphin Huey helicopters. Regarded as one of the most destructive storms to strike Vietnam since 1944, Typhoon Hester caused considerable damage in the country and disrupted the Vietnam War. Making landfall directly over the United States military installation in Chu Lai, Hester damaged or destroyed 75 percent of the structures in the base. Sustained winds and gusts in the base were estimated to have reached 130 km/h (80 mph) and 160 km/h (105 mph) respectively. Four hangars collapsed in the Chu Lai airbase, with total aircraft losses amounting to 36 destroyed and 87 damaged. Losses from the destroyed helicopters exceeded $3.6 million (1971 USD). Dozens of barracks were damaged in Chu Lai and communications were hampered. The 91st Evacuation Hospital was mostly destroyed and was forced to transfer patients to Quy Nh∆°n. Nearly 50 percent of the structures at the Marble Mountain Air Facility were damaged by the storm's high winds. Heavy rains accompanying the storm, peaking at at Camp Eagle, caused considerable flooding in the country. Approximately 370 km (230 mi) of coastline between Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and ƒê√† N·∫µng were inundated. About 90 percent of homes in ƒê√† N·∫µng were damaged. Flooding from the storm washed out a bridge between Fire Support Base Birmingham and Camp Eagle, temporarily isolating two units within the 94th Field Artillery Regiment. Extensive losses to agriculture also took place, with major crop losses reported and 900 cattle killed. According to government officials, the entire banana, rice, and sugar cane crop was destroyed and harvests could not be made until the following spring. Offshore, nearly 500 vessels sank or were destroyed by the storm and the 1,000 ton Union Pacific ran aground. Damage to a barracks in Camp Evans According to newspaper reports, 100 Vietnamese perished during Hester. Thirty-three fatalities took place after a Republic of Vietnam Air Force transport crashed near Quy Nh∆°n. Thee Americans were killed due to flying debris during the storm and twenty-one others were injured. On October 25, thunderstorms associated with Hester were blamed on a helicopter crash Nha Trang that killed ten Americans. Roughly 550,000 homes were destroyed across the country, leaving an estimated 200,000 people homeless. On October 25, Premier Tran Thien Khiem toured some of the storm-ravaged areas and made on-the-spot grants of $19,000 to each province and $3,500 to ƒê√† N·∫µng. He also promised that 50,000 sheets of tin roofing would be sent to aid in reconstruction. Later that day, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered $725,000 be made available for disaster relief in the northern provinces following an emergency meeting. The Social Welfare Ministry estimated that $1.5 million would be needed for civilian relief. Elsewhere Tracking over the southern Philippines as a tropical storm, Hester caused some damage in the country. Winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) were reported in Cebu City as the storm passed by. A total of six people were killed while twenty-two sustained injuries and another two were reported missing. Damage amounted to ‚Ç±5 million. In North Vietnam, the Viet Cong was reportedly taking \\"urgent measures\\" to cope with the aftermath of the typhoon. A Chinese news broadcast stated that 100 million piastres had been allocated for relief efforts.

Early life and education  Nicholas Basbanes is the son of two first-generation Greek-Americans. He graduated from Lowell High School in 1961 and earned a bachelor's degree in English from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, in 1965. Following a year of graduate study at Pennsylvania State University, he did research for his master's thesis in Washington, D.C., then entered U. S. Navy Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island. He attended the Defense Information School in the spring of 1968 and received his master's degree in journalism in 1969 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier during the first of two combat deployments he made to Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin, off the coast of Vietnam.Chauncey Mabe, \\"The Book On Books: Nicholas Basbanes Brings a Journalist's Training and Sensibility to Writing About, well, Writing, and Books,\\" South Florida Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, FL), March 14, 2004.  Career   Early journalism  Discharged from active duty in 1971, Basbanes went to work as a general assignment reporter for The Evening Gazette in Worcester, Massachusetts, specializing in investigative journalism. In 1978, he was appointed books editor of a sister publication, the Worcester Sunday Telegram, a full-time position that included writing a weekly column for which he would interview more than a thousand authors over the next twenty-one years. Due to cost cutting measures, the Telegram, then known as the Telegram & Gazette, removed its book section in 1990. When Basbanes left the newspaper later in 1991 to complete his first book, he continued writing the column and distributed it through Literary Features Syndicate, an agency that he formed that placed it in more than thirty publications nationwide. He writes the \\"Gently Mad\\" column for Fine Books & Collections magazine, and lectures widely on book-related subjects.Nicholas Basbanes, \\"Acute Bibliomania,\\" Fine Books & Collections, Summer 2020.  Books  Basbanes' first book, A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books, was published in 1995. The topic was originally dismissed as too arcane for a general readership by many New York editors who had passed on the opportunity to publish it, but the book later found sizable success with multiple printings.William A. Davis, \\"Bible for Bibliophiles: Basbanes' 'A Gentle Madness' Confounds the Naysayers, \\" Boston Globe, June 26, 1996, reprinted Bates Magazine, Spring 1997. and John Baker, \\"A Mania for Books,\\" Publishers Weekly, vol. 252, issue 45, November 11, 2005. Michael Dirda of The Washington Post called it a \\"ingratiating and altogether enjoyable book\\", praising the book's \\"wonderful gallery of modern eccentrics\\" despite its occasional lapses in literary history. A Gentle Madness was named a New York Times notable book of the year\\"Notable Books of the year 1995,\\"New York Times,December 3, 1995. and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in nonfiction for 1995. In 2010, Allison Hoover Bartlett writing for the Wall Street Journal named it one of the most influential works about book collecting published in the twentieth century. By 2003, with the publication of A Splendor of Letters, Basbanes was already acknowledged as a leading authority on books and book culture. One reviewer commented, \\"No other writer has traced the history of the book so thoroughly or so engagingly,\\"Andre Bernard,\\"Fear of Book Assasination [sic] Haunts Bibliophile's Musings,\\" The New York Observer, December 15, 2013. and Yale University Press chose him to write its 2008 centennial history, A World of Letters, which chronicled the inside stories of its classic books from conception to production. Basbanes' ninth book, On Paper: The Everything of Its Two-Thousand-Year History, is not only a consideration of paper as a principal medium for the transmission of text over the past ten centuries, but also a wider examination of the ubiquitous material itself. The eight-year project, which was released in October 2013, was supported in part by the award of a National Endowment for the Humanities Research Fellowship in 2008.NEH 2008 Grant Obligations Massachusetts It was named a notable book by the American Library Association,ALA News, \\"2014 Notable Books List,\\" January 26,2014 and was one of three finalists for the 2014 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction.ALA.org, Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence in Fiction and Nonfiction, Awards Finalists, April 7, 2014.

The Public Scholar program is designed to promote the publication of scholarly nonfiction books for general audiences.Ron Charles, \\"Uncle Sam Wants YOU to Read 'Popular' Scholarly Books,\\" Washington Post, The Style Blog, July 28, 2015.  Archives  The Cushing Memorial Library and Archives of Texas A&M; University acquired Basbanes' papers as the Nicholas A. Basbanes Collection in December 2015.

It is a cross-genre work that blends experimental theatre, prose poetry, short story, and political philosophy with a manifesto on democracy and American life in a post‚Äì9/11 world.P√©rez, Rolando. \\"The Bilingualisms of Latino/a Literatures.\\" The Oxford Handbook of Latino Studies (2020): 282. The book dramatizes the global war on terror and narrates the author's displacement after the attacks from her home in the Battery Park neighborhood in New York City. The work addresses Latin American immigration to the United States, Puerto Rico's colonial status, and \\"power imbalances within the Americas.\\" Summary Part One: Ground Zero Part One, titled as \\"Ground Zero\\", critiques 21st-century capitalism and corporate censorship with its depictions of New York City before and during the September 11 attacks. Part One unfolds through a collection of metafiction, short stories, and philosophical essays on American culture since the attacks on the World Trade Center. Using avant-garde techniques, Braschi links post-9/11 fears of terrorism with the \\"daily suffering that stems from a changing, debt-ridden economy to offer a scathing critique of neoliberal economic and social reforms.\\" Part Two: United States of Banana In Part Two, called \\"United States of Banana\\", the structure radically changes from political manifesto and philosophical fiction into an experimental theater play about economic terrorism, U.S. colonialism, liberty, and love.Cruz- Malav√©, Arnaldo Manuel. \\"Under the Skirt of Liberty: Giannina Braschi Rewrites Empire.\\" American Quarterly 66.3 (2014): 801-818. Historical literary characters Hamlet and Zarathustra (Zoroaster) join the author's alter-ego, Giannina, on a quest to liberate the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo from the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, where he has been held by his father, the king of the United States of Banana, for more than 100 years, for the crime of having been born.\\"Review of United States of Banana,\\" Library Journal, 1 October 2011 When the King remarries, he frees his son, and for the sake of reconciliation, makes Puerto Rico the fifty-first state and grants American passports to all Latin American citizens. The play dramatizes the plight of prisoners in the United States, Puerto Rico's position as an American territory, and Braschi's struggle for liberty. By having the people of Puerto Rico vote on Segismundo's liberty, the work satirizes the three political options of Puerto Rico: statehood, nation, or colony. The prison scenes feature Middle Eastern prisoners of war, including those classified as terrorists, who are detained indefinitely. Adaptations *American photographer Michael Somoroff directed and produced a series of short art films of the author's oral interpretation of the book; these films debuted at Cervantes Institute in New York on December 1, 2012. *In 2015, Colombian film and theater director Juan Pablo Felix adapted United States of Banana for the stage as a play of the same name.

Corporate social responsibility Created by Matthew Proman and Star Jones in May 2014, the NAPW Foundation is the company's nonprofit philanthropic endeavor designed to support causes that are front burner issues for women. The American Heart Association, of which she is also the National Volunteer; the Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Dress for Success and Girls, Inc. are the founding philanthropic partners. NAPW Local Chapter philanthropic initiatives are based around these charitable organizations as well as other local community fundraising events. Support for other charities and nonprofit organizations focused on women's issues and child wellness, and included the Jack Martin Fund at the pediatric oncology unit of Mt. Sinai Hospital, (for which Proman is member of the Advisory Board ) and the American Cancer Society and the Jack Theissen Children's Society. NAPW and the NAPW Foundation hold no relationship with \\"Napw Charitable Foundation\\" As of January 2018 the NAPW foundation seems inactive, its social media properties have not been updated since January 2017 and the website www.napwfoundation.org is no longer online. Education scholarships NAPW created the Rising Stars Education Scholarship Program, awarding scholarships to graduating high school seniors and undergraduate students who attend an accredited college, university or certified trade school in the U.S. Open to daughters of organization members, the scholarships are awarded to five outstanding students. The Rising Stars program was active until 2014. Professional Diversity Network Merger (2014) In July 2014 Professional Diversity Network (NASDAQ:IPDN) Announced a merger with NAPW which was completed on September 24, 2014. As a result of this transaction, Star Jones, Matthew Proman, Randi Zuckerberg, and Donna Brazile joined PDN's Board of Directors. Jones was also named President of Professional Diversity Network, and Proman served as Director and Chief Operating Officer. According to Professional Diversity Network's press release, at the time of the merger, NAPW shown revenues in excess of $19 Million and Positive Cash Flow. According to SEC 10K filing from September 2017, NAPW revenue for the last Quarter ending in September 2017 was $2,223,194 with a net loss of (1,528,231).https://investor.prodivnet.com/all- sec-filings/content/0001214659-17-006614/d11217010q.htm NAPW's Parent company Professional Diversity Network shares lost over 90% of its value since the Merger was confirmed, dropping from $44.72 (adj. close) to $4.07 Resignation of NAPW founder Matthew Proman (2016) In July 2016, Professional Diversity Network, Inc. announced that its COO and Director, Matthew Proman, had resigned his positions and his Board seat earlier in the year to \\"pursue other ventures.\\" At the time of his departure, Proman stated that he felt confident that he had \\"left the company in good hands and that NAPW will continue to flourish and drive shareholder value.\\" PDN's CEO at the time, Jim Kirsch, stated at the time that PDN was \\"never stronger.\\" Acquisition by Chinese investors (2016) In 2016, IPDN found itself in a precarious position. Revenue from the NAPW Network dried up after two of the three offices NAPW operated prior to the Merger were closed, which significantly reduced the size of the operation. In the 2nd quarter of 2016 revenue continued to nosedive, with sales down by one-third and only just over $1.3mil left on the balance sheet.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1546296/000121465916013265/p81316010q.htm By the 3rd quarter, the cash balance had dwindled to just over $500k https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1546296/000121465916014631/s1108201610q.htm and the company was in need of an urgent solution to avoid bankruptcy. On August 15, 2016 a group of Chinese investors bought a majority stake in IPDN (NAPW's parent company) for $20mil via a Seychelles based shell company called Cosmic Forward Limited (CFL). All shareholders involved are executives of a Chinese company called GNet Group. Gnet Group (Gate Wang) has been criticized by Southern Weekly, a respected Chinese newspaper, as a scam that dupes small, unsophisticated investors out of their savings. GNet investors have taken to the streets to protest the company and have formed Internet forums to expose what some claim is a Ponzi scheme. Complaints As of January 2018 NAPW carries an \\"F\\" rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). BBB's report states that the company's rating is due to 163 open complaints, 58 negative reviews and 0 positive reviews filed within the past three years, the length of time the company took to respond to complaints, its failure to resolve their underlying causes, and the nature of its advertising. The majority of complaints stem from the organization advertising and telling consumers that their membership is free, but once getting in contact with consumers they require annual membership fees that run up to $1000 a year. The organization does not offer written information on membership packages, but rather require that consumers choose over the phone which package they want and provide payment information before their membership application is processed. The report further indicates that consumers \\"were subjected to high pressure sales tactics by company representatives to join the organization even before they understood the costs or benefits. Other consumers that originally agreed to join the organization but opted afterward to cancel the membership say that they have difficulty reaching any company representatives to seek a refund.\\" Yelp members currently rate the business at 1 star, mostly due to misleading sales practices. Previous and current employees substantiate much of the consumer complaints on the company's Glassdoor profile. The increasing number of complaints and the severely damaged reputation of the NAPW brand and might have contributed to the decision of rebooting the operation under a new brand. Launch of the International Association of Women (IAW) (2018)  According to PDN's SEC filings, NAPW experienced a steady decline since acquired by Professional Diversity Network in 2014, with reported revenue dropping every quarter. In August 2017 NAPW's CEO leaves the company and her departure is followed by a significant reduction in force that took place in late September 2017. In January 2018, Professional Diversity Network announced through a Press Release that it will be launching International Association of Women (IAW). According to the official communication distributed to the media, IAW would be operating independently from NAPW, but other sources from the company indicate that the launch of IAW was actually a rebranding of NAPW. In the 2nd paragraph of the Press Release it reads\\"The company currently operates the National Association of Professional Women (‚ÄúNAPW‚Äù), whose membership is now also expected to benefit from this international opportunity in addition to the vast array of additional benefits launched in 2017.\\" However, IAW's blog included a rewritten version of the same press release that replaces the second paragraph with: \\"The National Association of Professional Women (‚ÄúNAPW‚Äù) has been rebranded as IAW through this launch. Under the new brand name of IAW, existing NAPW members will benefit from this international opportunity in addition to the vast array of additional benefits launched in 2017\\"'. All NAPW social media properties had been either shut down or redirected to IAW properties This is the second time PDN announces the launch of IAW. According to an official Press Release from October 3, 2017, the brand had already been launched during the Women's Forum Global Meeting in Paris on October 5. PDN's IAW has no relationship with International Alliance of Women, an international women's rights organization also known as IAW.

Upon completion, which is scheduled for 2023, it will be the world's largest fully steerable single-dish radio telescope. It is intended to operate at 300 MHz to 117 GHz. The construction of the antenna project is under the leadership of the Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The fully steerable dish of the QTT will allow it to observe 75% of the stars in the sky at any given time. The QTT and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), also located in China, can both observe frequencies in the \\"water hole\\" that has traditionally been favored by scientists engaged in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), meaning that each observatory could provide follow-up observations of putative signals from extraterrestrials detected in this quiet part of the radio spectrum at the other observatory. The radio telescope site selection team considered 48 candidate locations throughout Xinjiang. The chosen site for the facility is in the foothills of the Tian Shan mountains, near Shihezi village, Banjiegou Town, about 46 km (straight-line distance) south-south-east of the Qitai county seat (Qitai Town). The mountain ridges surrounding the site are supposed to provide some protection from electromagnetic noise. The authorities propose designating a radio quiet zone (a 10 km by 15 km rectangle, much smaller than the United States National Radio Quiet Zone) around the future facility. Also, there is QES-China optical survey telescope installed in Astroshell dome. Goals The main goals of the QTT include imaging of pulsars, stellar formation, and the large-scale radio structure of the universe.

Description Species of Prospero grow from bulbs, the leaves and flowers appearing in the autumn and dying down in spring. The leaves are relatively narrow. Each bulb produces one to four flowering stems (scapes) bearing dense racemes of pink to violet flowers. The long tepals are not joined together. The stamens have filaments coloured like the tepals and short purple anthers. The dark brown seeds are more-or-less oblong. Systematics The genus Prospero was created by Richard Salisbury in 1866. However, some species he placed in the genus, such as P. hyacinthoideum and P. lingulatum, are currently placed in other genera. Franz Speta and co-workers from the 1970s onwards split up the broadly defined genus Scilla, placing many species into separate genera. The modern understanding of Prospero dates from 1982, with Speta's re-assignment of Scilla autumnalis (among other species) to Prospero. The genus is placed in the tribe Hyacintheae (or the subfamily Hyacinthoideae by those who use the family Hyacinthaceae).

Fighting took place over a wide swath of Inner Asia, from present-day central and eastern Mongolia to Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang regions of present-day China. Qing victories ultimately led to the incorporation of Outer Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang into the Qing Empire that was to last until the fall of the dynasty in 1911‚Äì1912, and the genocide of much of the Dzungar population in conquered areas. Background After the collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, China's Mongol rulers withdrew to Mongolia and became known as the Northern Yuan dynasty. Over time, the Mongol state disintegrated into a series of Khanates, ruled by various descendants of Genghis Khan. The Qing dynasty defeated the Inner Chahar Mongol leader Ligdan Khan and annexed Inner Mongolia. While the Eastern Mongols (Outer and Inner Mongols) were ruled by Chingisids, the Oirats were ruled by the Choros clan. The Dzungar Oirats under Erdeni Batur and Zaya Pandita held a pan-Oirat-Mongol conference in 1640 with all Oirat and Mongol tribes participating except the Inner Mongols under Qing rule. The conference ended in failure. By the 1650s, the Dzungar Khanate, an Oirat state centered in Dzungaria and western Mongolia, had risen to become the preeminent khanate in the region and was often in conflict with Khalkha Mongols, the remnants of the Northern Yuan dynasty, of eastern Mongolia. Upon assuming the throne after the death of his brother Sengge in 1670, Galdan Boshugtu Khan launched a series of successful campaigns to expand his territory as far as present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern Kyrgyzstan to southern Siberia. Through skillful diplomacy, Galdan maintained peaceful relations with the Qing dynasty while also establishing relations with Russia. However, when Galdan's brother Dorjijab was killed in a skirmish with troops loyal to the Khalkha khan in 1687, Galdan took the pretext to launch a full-scale invasion of eastern Mongolia. He destroyed several Khalkha tribes at the battle of Olgoi Nor (Olgoi Lake) in 1688, sending twenty thousand refugees fleeing south to Qing territory.Peter C. Perdue, China Marches West:The Qing Conquest of Central Asia, pg. 149 The Khalkha rulers, defeated, fled to Hohhot and sought Qing assistance.New Qing Imperial History:The Making of an Inner Asian Emire at Qing Chengde, Ruth W. Dunnell, Mark Elliot, James A. Millward, pg. 99 Meanwhile, the Qing had secured a peace treaty with the Cossacks on their northern border, who had previously been inclined to support Galdan. The Treaty of Nerchinsk prevented an alliance between Galdan and the Russians, leaving the Qing free to attack their Mongol rivals.The Tea Road:China and Russia Meet Across the Steppe, pg. 106, Martha Avery Fearing a united Mongol state ruled by the hostile Dzungars, the Qing now turned their powerful war machine on the Oirats.The Sichuan Frontier and Tibet:Imperial Strategy in the Early Qing, 44,45, Yincong Dai The Dzungars had conquered and subjugated the Uyghurs during the Dzungar conquest of Altishahr after being invited by the Afaqi Khoja to invade the Chingisid Chagatai ruled Yarkent Khanate. Heavy taxes were imposed upon the Uyghurs by the Dzungars, provoking resentment. This led to uprisings and Uyghur rebels from Turfan and Kumul who were rebelling against Dzungar rule joined the Qing in their war against the Dzungars. The Yarkent Khanate under Muhammad Amin Khan presented tribute to the Qing dynasty twice to request aid against the Dzungar attack. The Dzungars used the Zamburak, camel mounted miniature cannons, in battle, notably at Ulan Butung.Millward 2007, p. 89. Gunpowder weapons like guns and cannons were deployed by the Qing and the Dzungars at the same time against each other.Millward 2007, p. 95. First Dzungar-Qing War The First Dzungar‚ÄìQing War was a military conflict fought from 1687 to 1697 between the Dzungar Khanate and an alliance of the Qing dynasty and the northern Khalkhas, remnants of the Northern Yuan dynasty. The war resulted from a Dzungar attack on the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Outer Mongolia, who were heavily defeated in 1688. Their rulers and twenty thousand refugees fled south to the Qing dynasty, which feared the growing power of the Dzungar state. Motivated by the opportunity to gain control over Mongolia and by the threat posed to them by a strong, unified Mongol state such as the Oirats threatened to form, the Qing sent their army north to subdue the Dzungars in 1690. Qing scouts attacked a Dzungar party north of the Great Wall. However, this proved to be the main Dzungar army, which destroyed the Qing detachment easily.Peter C. Perdue, China Marches West:The Qing Conquest of Central Asia, 153 A large Qing army under Prince Fuquan advanced North into Inner Mongolia, hoping to trap and crush the mobile Dzungar army. However, they were constrained by bad weather and difficult terrain. It took some Qing troops twelve days to cross the Gobi Desert, and the horses were left exhausted. Running low on supplies, the Qing finally confronted the Dzungars at Ulan Butung in September 1690. Although outnumbered 5 to 1, the Dzungars formed a camel wall, beat back a pair of artillery-supported Qing assaults, and escaped into the hills. The Qing commander claimed victory, but his failure to completely destroy the Dzungar forces led to his dismissal and early retirement.The Cambridge History of China, Willard J. Peterson, pg.154 Galdan was left in control of Mongolia from the Selenga River in the north to Khalkhyn Gol in the south.Historical Dictionary of Mongolia, Alan Sanders, pg. 288, Scarecrow Press A pause in the conflict ensued. The Khalkha rulers declared themselves Qing vassals at Dolon Nor (the site of Shangdu, the pleasure palace of the Yuan Emperors) in 1691, a politically decisive step that officially ended the last remnants of the Yuan dynasty. It also allowed the Qing to assume the mantle of the Genghisid khans, merging the Khalkha forces into the Qing army.J. Millward, Eurasian Crossroads:A history of Xinjiang, pg. 91 The Kangxi Emperor had now become determined to \\"exterminate\\" Galdan. Negotiations between the two sides bore little fruit. The Dzungars cast about for allies, making overtures to the Russians and various Mongol princes, but were rejected.Peter C. Perdue, China Marches West:The Qing Conquest of Central Asia,177-180 Kangxi set about preparing the complex logistics necessary to support a planned 1696 expedition. This included procuring 1,333 carts, each carrying 6 shi of grain. Three armies eventually advanced north in 1696. One, under the command of Fiyanggu, numbering 30,000 and to be reinforced with a further 10,000, was to trap Galdan, while Kangxi personally led 32,000 men, including 235 cannon on camelback. A third, numbering 10,000, halted further to the east and would play no part in the coming campaign. The Dzungar army, heavily outnumbered and weakened by the plague, was unable to offer serious resistance. Galdan's army attacked the western force at the Battle of Jao Modo in May 1696, but was narrowly - albeit decisively- defeated. The Dzungar army, bereft of artillery, suffered heavily from Chinese musketry and cannon fire,Wars in the Age of Louis Xiv, 1650-1715, C.J.Nolan, p.g. 224 eventually breaking. The battle ended in a victory for the Qing army, who captured 20,000 sheep and 40,000 cattle, and captured, killed or scattered all but 40-50 of the Dzungar army, effectively destroying them as a military force. Galdan himself had managed to escape from an enemy encirclement, thanks in part to a counterattack led by his wife, Queen Anu. Galdan's wife was killed, and Galdan fled west to the Altai Mountains, where later he attempted to surrender to the Qing, but died of the plague in 1697 with only a few loyal men at his side.Peter C. Perdue, China Marches West:The Qing Conquest of Central Asia,148- 189 After the war, a Qing garrison was stationed in the area of present-day Ulaanbaatar, and Khalkha Mongolia was placed under Qing rule. Outer Mongolia was effectively incorporated into the Qing Empire. On the other hand, Tsewang Rabtan, a long- time anti-Galdan Oirat chief, who had actually provided intelligence to the Qing at several points during the war, succeeded Galdan as Khan of the Dzungars. While the Qing managed to sideline the Dzungar in the 1690s, they would not completely eradicate them until they defeated the Dzungars in subsequent wars several decades later. Dzungar‚ÄìQing War in Tibet Lha-bzang Khan In 1642, G√ºshi Khan, founder of the Khoshut Khanate, overthrew the prince of Tsang and made the 5th Dalai Lama the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet,Ren√© Grousset, The Empire of the Steppes, New Brunswick 1970, p. 522 establishing the regime known as Ganden Phodrang. Tsewang Rabtan invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed the pretender to the position of Dalai Lama of Lha-bzang Khan, the last ruler of the Khoshut Khanate, and killed Lha-bzang Khan and his entire family. They also viciously destroyed a small force in the Battle of the Salween River which the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty had sent to clear traditional trade routes in 1718.Mullin 2001, p. 288 In response, an expedition sent by Kangxi Emperor, together with Tibetan forces under Polhan√© S√∂nam Topgy√© of Tsang and Kangchennas (also spelled Gangchenney), the governor of Western Tibet,Mullin 2001, p. 290Smith 1997, p. 125 expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. This began the Qing rule of Tibet, which lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Han Chinese General Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei) conquered Tibet for the Qing during the Dzungar‚ÄìQing War. Jalangga, a Manchu Bannermen, succeeded the Han General Yue Zhongqi as commander in 1732.https://m.repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/761498/Gregory_georgetown_0076D_13086.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y p. 160 Third Dzungar‚ÄìQing War In 1723, the Kangxi Emperor's successor, the Yongzheng Emperor, sent an army of 230,000 led by Nian Gengyao to quell a Dzungar uprising in Qinghai on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Due to geography, the Qing army (although superior in numbers) was at first unable to engage their more mobile enemy. Eventually, they met the Dzungars and defeated them. This campaign cost the treasury at least eight million silver taels. Later in Yongzheng's reign, he sent a small army of 10,000 to fight the Dzungars again. However, that army was annihilated near the Khoton Lake in 1731 and the Qing Empire once again faced the danger of losing control of Mongolia. A Khalkha ally of the Qing Empire would finally defeat the Dzungars a year later in 1732 near the Erdene Zuu Monastery in Mongolia. The Qing then made peace with the Dzungar Khanate and decided the border between them. The Oirats were fought by Yue Zhongqi in √úr√ºmqi.https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/761498/Gregory_georgetown_0076D_13086.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y p. 204. Yue Zhongqi lived at the Ji Xiaolan Residence. Final conquest of the Dzungars Map showing wars between Qing Dynasty and Dzungar Khanate In 1752, Dawachi and the Khoit-Oirat prince Amursana competed for the title of Khan of the Dzungars. Amursana suffered several defeats at the hands of Dawachi and was thus forced to flee with his small army to the protection of the Qing imperial court. The Yongzheng Emperor's successor, the Qianlong Emperor, pledged his support to Amursana, who recognized Qing authority; among those who supported Amursana and the Chinese were the Khoja brothers and . In 1755, Qianlong sent the Manchu general , who was aided by Amursana, BurhƒÅn al-Dƒ´n and KhwƒÅja-i JahƒÅn, to lead a campaign against the Dzungars. After several skirmishes and small scale battles along the Ili River, the Qing army, led by Zhaohui, approached Ili (Gulja) and forced Dawachi to surrender. Qianlong appointed Amursana as the Khan of Khoid and one of four equal khans ‚Äì much to the displeasure of Amursana, who wanted to be the Khan of the Dzungars. Amursana now rallied the majority of the remaining Oirats to rebel against Qing authority. In 1758, General Zhaohui defeated the Dzungars in two battles: the Battle of Oroi-Jalatu and the Battle of Khurungui. In the first battle, Zhaohui attacked Amursana's camp at night; Amursana was able to fight on until Zhaohui received enough reinforcements to drive him away. Between the battles of Oroi-Jalatu and Khurungui, the Chinese under Prince Cabdan-jab defeated Amursana at the Battle of Khorgos (known in the Qianlong engravings as the \\"Victory of Khorgos\\"). At Mount Khurungui, Zhaohui defeated Amursana in a night attack on his camp after crossing a river and drove him back. To commemorate Zhaohui's two victories, Qianlong had the Puning Temple of Chengde constructed, home to the world's tallest wooden sculpture of the bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara and hence its alternate name, the 'Big Buddha Temple'. Afterwards, of Turfan submitted to the Qing Empire. After all of these battles, Amursana fled to Russia (where he died) while Ching√ºnjav fled north to Darkhad but was captured at Wang Tolgoi and executed in Beijing.

The mechanism for this type of shallow water blackout is lack of oxygen expedited by low carbon dioxide levels, as a consequence of voluntary hyperventilation before the dive. Blackouts which occur in swimming pools are probably driven only by excessive hyperventilation, with no significant influence from pressure change. * , loss of consciousness caused by lack of oxygen to the brain at the end of a deep breath-hold dive during the latter part of the ascent or immediately after surfacing. This is due to lowered oxygen partial pressure caused by a reduction in ambient pressure. Blackout in the shallow stage of ascent from deep free-dives may also sometimes be called \\"deep-water blackout\\". * , one of which is a hypoxic loss of consciousness while ascending on a rebreather because of a sudden uncompensated drop of oxygen partial pressure in the breathing loop. This may occur as a result of the pressure reduction during ascent, usually associated with manual closed-circuit and semi-closed-circuit rebreathers. A similar effect can occur in open circuit scuba if a diver continues to breathe a hypoxic gas intended for avoiding oxygen toxicity in the deep sector, at a depth shallower than the minimum operating depth for the gas, but this is usually just called hypoxia.

Writing Larry Spotted Crow Mann's writing career began in his youth when he wrote letters to the government to draw attention to issues the Nipmuc people faced. He has been writing prose and poetry since his teens. He says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm somebody who is dedicated to my culture and tradition, and through that I hope to bring forth the intrinsic connection we all have as human beings. I love to learn new things and from other cultures.‚Äù He intends his writing and music to honor traditions and teach uninformed audiences about Nipmuc people and history. Spotted Crow Mann published his first book, a collection of short stories and poetry entitled Tales from the Whispering Basket, in 2013. In that book, he says, he wanted to acknowledge Nipmuc contributions to the foundations of America and to explore his ability to write in different genres. The stories cover themes of cultural loss, racial differences, and loneliness. Spotted Crow Mann has also contributed news and opinion pieces to Indian Country Today Media Network. Music As a musician, Spotted Crow Mann is a member of the Quabbin Lake Singers, a group that seeks to honor tribal culture, along with his three sons Anoki, Nantai, and Manixit. Spotted Crow Mann holds the role of Drum Keeper in the group, which requires him to ‚Äúensure the Drum is being honored and played in a manner for the particular ceremony taking place.‚Äù The Drum is a sacred object in his culture, respected as ‚Äúthe heart beat of Mother Earth‚Äù and ‚Äúallows [them] to pray and communicate with the natural elements of the world and beyond.‚Äù Other projects Larry Spotted Crow Mann has appeared in two documentaries about Native Americans: Living In Two Worlds and First Patriots. He was also cast in Chris Eyre's PBS documentary series We Shall Remain. He has also participated in environmental activism, such as working with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in order to protect an indigenous fish local to the Worcester area. He has stated that \\"[the] Earth is not something for you to rip apart. It's there for everyone to share and understand.\\" Mann asserts that if Indian culture had progressed on its own without European influence, it would have created more environmentally-friendly technologies than those commonly used today. Personal life Spotted Crow Mann lives in Webster, Massachusetts in Worcester County, a place where his ancestors have lived ‚Äúsince time immemorial.‚Äù Mann was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts. He explains that growing up there in the 1980s was difficult for him due to his identity as a Native American. Despite his people's history in the area, he felt different and out of place among the other children: ‚ÄúOur people have always been here, but when you‚Äôre a kid and there are very few people who can identify with who you are, you actually begin to feel like an outsider on the very Earth your people have been on for thousands of years.‚Äù List of publications Books *Tales from the Whispering Basket. 2011.

He also paints genre scenes and makes realism sculptures. Bryden's plein air paintings include Mexico, Cuba, Alaska, Russia, New York City and the American West. He has exhibited since 1973 at over 20 solo exhibitions and many group shows. Formally trained as an architect, Bryden is self-taught in the fine arts. His style is informed by his interest in rendering different kinds of light. Curator Martha Hoppin describes Bryden's method: ‚ÄúHe paints the light in space, and then fills the space with nature.‚Äù Bryden lives in New York City with his wife Elizabeth. His daughter, Nell Bryden, is a singer performing around the UK and Ireland. Bryden maintains studios in New York City and Hadley, Massachusetts. In Hadley, he paints in his home or on a houseboat on the Connecticut River.  Background  From an early age, Bryden knew he wanted to be an artist. When he was nine years old, he won second place in a statewide children's art competition. That same year he sold a watercolor out of a children's exhibit at the Norton Museum of Fine Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. ‚ÄúThat sealed it for me,‚Äù Bryden remembers. He graduated from Yale (B.A.1966) and from Graduate School of Design at Harvard (M.A. 1970). While making a living as an architectural renderer, Bryden continued to develop his technique as an artist by going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City where he spent hours copying masterpieces. > ‚ÄúThe best place to study the art that interested me was in the museum‚Ä¶ I set > my easel up in front of one masterpiece after another, copying from > Velasquez, Vermeer, Caravaggio, Titian, Hals, and of course Rembrandt. I > also copied Renoir, Monet, and Pissarro among the Impressionists. It was > here, that I began to see the common thread of art that moved me, and why > contemporary art had failed to do so. The subjects of these paintings were > people from across the ages who were also like us, and they were captured in > believable human moments.‚Äù It wasn't until 1988, when Bryden moved to Massachusetts, that his dream of supporting himself as a professional artist became a reality. He continued to do architectural work but began selling more canvases as area art buyers discovered his paintings of local landscapes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a beautiful spot and people like to see things they know. That allowed me for the first time to sell enough to live on.‚Äù  Landscapes  Bryden paints three basic types of landscapes: panoramic views, waterscapes and architecture in landscape. Bryden's best-known works are his panoramic views, usually from Mt. Holyoke in Hadley, Mass. In this work, he focuses on nature as a paradox. Bryden says, ‚ÄúNature up close is wild and brutal, but from a distance it is serene and ordered.‚Äù In all of his landscapes he emphasizes nature over man. Carl Little in Paintings of New England says ‚ÄúIn his landscapes of the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts Lewis Bryden has been known to edit out all the accumulated debris of modern life, including cars, telephone poles, and road signs.‚Äù A second focus is waterscapes. Bryden paints scenes of mountain vistas and the shoreline of the Connecticut River from the water's surface. Bryden's \\"river studio,\\" a houseboat he bought as a place to paint, allows him to maximize his time working in nature and provides a unique viewpoint. A third category is architecture in landscape. Bryden's background as an architect comes through in these works, but his depictions have a rich style that uses the light, irregular edges, and the texture of the paint to portray the building's character, rather than a strict draftsman-style representation of the form. Most of Bryden's painting is done outdoors, which presents the obstacles of varied weather conditions and rapidly changing light. In Hadley, Mass. he paints from his 26-foot pontoon boat called \\"Float des Artistes.\\" ‚ÄúUsually the studio is where you go back to after you find a spot you like. This way I can take the studio to the spot I like.‚Äù Many artists work from a bridge or on the bank. Bryden has always preferred to be in the river. ‚ÄúThis allows me to be right in the middle of the water, and allows me to see things in a different way.‚Äù When he received a commission from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for a 47x54-inch painting on the river, he knew he needed to come up with a unique solution. He purchased a houseboat from the owner of the Food Bank Farm in Hadley. After a few upgrades, including replacing the 15-horsepower motor with a 50-horsepower engine and adding some new flooring he was ready to go. ‚ÄúI turned the houseboat into a floating studio.‚Äù Since the light on the river is so variable, he has to work quickly. ‚ÄúIn about two hours, the light has changed so much that I really can‚Äôt continue any more. I have to start a new painting and wait until the same time of day for the light to come back.‚Äù He has developed several methods to overcome the time pressure. He takes 15 minutes to mix his colors and then another 15 to sketch the scene on canvas. He'll spend two or three hours on the river, take a break, and then return in the afternoon. Another method he uses is to make a pencil sketch from memory of a view that interests him. Later he'll revisit the site to add details. He'll then transfer the drawings to canvas and sketch the composition in sepia paint. Once this is ready, he takes the large canvas outside at the same time of day and in the same light conditions as in his memory, and he captures the colors. Over the summer, Bryden will begin 30-50 paintings. He later finishes his paintings, with the help of his sketches to remind him of the colors, in either his Hadley or Manhattan studio.  Vision  In an article on Bryden, Martha Hoppin speaks highly of his sensitivity: > \\"Bryden is a poet. He constructs studies of light and air and space. ‚ÄòI am > not painting a landscape,‚Äô he says, ‚ÄòI am painting a painting.‚Äô Despite the > artist's emphasis on the act of painting, he cares deeply about his subject > matter. He communicates his own joy at being outside in nature and his sense > that the world is a satisfying place to live. He depicts nature's beauty in > its serene and comfortable moments. The human element in relation to the > landscape does not interest him. He does not seek drama, and he does not > strive for ‚Äòhigher‚Äô meaning through the use of symbolic motifs. His works > are most remarkable for their feeling of harmony and serenity, and above > all, for their unaffected naturalness.\\"  Painting locations   Havana (2002)  In 2002, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Bryden's visit to Cuba on an artistic mission. He spent five days there and completed a series of \\"plein air\\" paintings. > I had permission from the Treasury Department to go to Cuba on a kind of > cultural exchange, and I intended to use the time to do as many \\"plein air\\" > paintings as I could, even though I only had five days. My impressions were > quick and sketchy; it is hard to say how much they might have changed with > more time spent there. Although I do not know a lot about Cuba, it has > always formed a part of my imagination. My youth spent in Florida was filled > with stories told by people who had visited it as tourists before the > Revolution and by refugees after the Revolution who remembered it as their > lost homeland. I always had a very vivid image of the island in my mind. My > short visit there both confirmed and contradicted that vision. Now, in my > mind there are two Cubas‚Äîthe Cuba imagined or remembered from stories, > versus the Cuba seen and experienced. The tension between the two, finally, > forms a theme for this series of paintings.  Colorado  Bryden has taken several painting trips to Colorado and the neighboring states of New Mexico and Arizona. He enjoys the spectacular scenery in the mountains and the dramatic seasons.  Glacier Bay Basin. Alaska  For an artist who pursues light, Alaska is a natural setting. Bryden has gone to Glacier Bay, Alaska to capture the unusual lighting conditions there. In the Alaskan summer, painting could be done in natural light from very early morning to nearly the middle of the night.  Coney Island  Bryden has painted a series he calls ‚Äò‚ÄôBoardwalk Idyll‚Äô‚Äô that spans over 30 years of work. The series, which explores the eternal summer of adolescence, was exhibited at the Brooklyn Public Library in 2004 and later at the R. Michelson Galleries in Northampton, Massachusetts. In a talk about this series, he states ‚ÄúOther artists before me have used Coney Island, each in his own way. I started studying the work of Reginald Marsh, David Levine, and the photographer Bruce Davidson. My own particular inspiration was a fascination with people in public places who are acting out their private dramas.‚Äù One collector of Bryden's work, Michael Mao, has four of the series‚Äô near life- size paintings displayed in one small room, creating the illusion of having walked into a cocktail party where people have already gathered. ‚ÄúThe figures are friendly, not intimidating, so they are a welcome addition to our home,‚Äù said Mao. ‚ÄúWhen Lewis borrows them for an exhibition it is as if some of the family has gone missing.‚Äù Bryden's method for these pieces was inspired by the ‚Äúcrust of paint‚Äù on impressionist Claude Monet‚Äôs work ‚ÄúWater Lilies.‚Äù Bryden developed his own textured sculptural-style technique to create the surface texture for his Boardwalk paintings. To ‚Äúmimic the atmospheric conditions of a hot summer day,‚Äù Bryden mixes Neo Megilp with 50% stand oil to coat his canvas. He then adds pigment and varnish, ‚Äúas much as the canvas will take.‚Äù Each painting portrays a moment of interaction or isolation on the boardwalk. Bryden describes them, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre [moments] of tranquility, waiting for something to happen.‚Äù They tell a story. ‚ÄúEach of one these is a stand-alone story, even though I have no idea what the story is.‚Äù He captures people's interactions, ‚ÄúI wanted them to react to each other. He goes after the tension that is built when they ‚Äúrecognize that the other person exists.‚Äù With the bustle of the Boardwalk, Bryden relies on sketches and photographs as well as sessions with live models for his pieces. A few paintings were inspired by a box of Kodachrome slides he found of a couple. The slides captured scenes similar to the ones he had been painting. As there was no way to identify the owners to return the slides, he used the images as an inspiration for several pieces.  Mexico and American Southwest  Bryden began visiting Mexico annually in 1993. During his visits, he does informal portraits and sketches in the public squares capturing plein air impressions of the moment. In 1994, he put his work together into a series, ‚ÄúTierra Insolita‚Äù which was formally presented in the exhibition at the Galleria Ixcateopan in Acapulco in that same year. Acapulco is his home base during these visits, but he takes trips with friends to remote, mountainous areas of Guerrero. During one of these trips, he decided to do a series on the average, everyday person living in Mexico. Writer Stephen Lockwood describes these paintings: ‚ÄúEvery picture in the series is very direct, there is little for the eye to focus on, other than the facial characteristic of the subject. The directional gaze of each sitter is varied: some look directly at the viewer, others look off to the left or to the right. The different position of each head has the effect of changing how engaged or disengaged each portrait is with the observer.‚Äù  Art projects   Portraits  While Bryden has done many portraits, he does not consider himself a portrait artist and has never taken a commission for a portrait. He usually paints friends and family and occasional professional models. He has done a few self-portraits, but they have rarely been exhibited. Bryden is very interested in the relationships and stories of people he paints. He is attracted to stories of artists and the relationships they have with the muses that inspire them.  Sculpture  As with the rest of his art, Bryden's sculpting technique is mainly self-taught. He has recently been doing more sculpture, having entered this mode after he learned one of his models was allergic to turpentine. His time with the model was limited and he wanted to capture her features, so he turned to the medium of clay. He later learned the process of bronze sculpture and stone carving. His most recent commission, Nature as Muse, is a life-size bronze in the Mallinckrodt Garden at the art center called View in Old Forge, NY.

The game featured gameplay like other Tetris titles, with a new soundtrack. The game reached 100 million paid downloads by 2010,EA Launches New Tetris¬Æ Game on the App Store Today, EA (December 1, 2011) making it the best-selling paid mobile game of all time. Gameplay After completing level 15, Magic mode is completed. Gameplay was nearly identical in gameplay to other Tetris titles, but with a new soundtrack. Players also had the ability to create their own soundtrack for the game using the music library of the iPhone or iPod Touch device in which the game is being played on. The game offered two modes of play dubbed \\"Marathon\\" mode and \\"Magic\\" mode. Marathon Marathon mode played as a more classic version of Tetris, where a point system along with number of lines cleared were kept as indicators of progress. The level of speed was chosen prior to starting the mode of gameplay. There were 15 levels total, and like Magic mode, this mode ends after all 15 levels have been completed. Unlike the original version of Tetris, Marathon mode ends after clearing 150 lines. Once Marathon mode ends, the Endless feature becomes unlocked. Magic Magic mode was an enhanced version of gameplay, where there are fifteen levels of difficulty. Each level of difficulty is incremented by speed and number of lines required to clear the level. Once the number of lines required to clear the level are met, the next level is presented. Upon failure of a level, the game offers players to retry an unlimited number of times. The game allows for pausing of gameplay, which is automatic when a player receives a phone call on an iPhone device. Another element of gameplay in Magic mode is the addition of helper objects that are retrieved throughout levels, which allow players to make minor edits to the puzzle. The special objects become available in the first five levels, and then remain generating upon lines completed and tetriminos placed. There are five special objects, ranging from a magic crayon to blocks converting to bubble popping status. History On November 30, 2011, the game was relaunched and replaced with a paid new version, which comes with an additional \\"Marathon One Touch Mode\\" as well as a paid subscription which comes with discounts and premium content.

Her work incorporates Native American ceremonialism, Mexican mysticism and Hispanic folk art as well as the Penitente art of New Mexico, Native American dances and ceremonies, and Catholic traditions.Artistic Spirit Gallery: Anita Rodriguez's Bio She has a work in the collection of the New Mexico Capitol Art Collection,New Mexico Capitol Art Collection website Eteljorg Museum in Indianapolis, the Albuquerque Museum of Art and the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos. She is also considered to be a specialist in traditional adobe construction and has won awards for her work.  Biography  Rodriguez was born in Taos, New Mexico. Her father's side of the family were \\"native Hispanic Taose√±os\\" and had been living in the area for many generations. Her mother was a painter from Austin, Texas who relocated to Taos in order to study art with Walter Ufer. Rodriguez was raised Catholic. During Rodriguez's teen years, she went to Mexico City where she spent time painting and learned the styles of Mexican artists such as Frida Kahlo. Rodriguez took art at both Colorado College and at the University of Denver. Later, she gave birth to a daughter, Shemai, in 1965. She started her own construction company in Taos in order to support herself and her daughter. Her construction work focused on the use of adobe to create fireplaces and nichos. Even while working on fireplaces, Rodriguez felt that instead of creating something commonplace, that her work was \\"functional sculpture.\\" After Shemai grew up and left the house, Rodriguez retired from construction and started painting full-time. Shemai is currently the webmaster for her mother's website. She later moved to Guanajuato, Mexico in 1996 and left to move back to Taos in 2010.  Art  Rodriguez's art is very concerned with death, resurrection and its relationship to Mexican culture. The idea of death for Rodriguez has two major functions. The first is that without death, there is no eternal life and the second is to remind the viewer to enjoy their life now. The skeletons she uses to embody this concept have ties to traditional Mexican art and are present in many of her works. She also traces the uses of skeletons as an art motif further back to pre-Columbian times. Rodriguez is influenced by indigenous religious practices, Christian themes and also Jewish celebrations. Rodriguez enjoys combining and contrasting different spiritual and cultural traditions, reflecting the multicultural world that she grew up with in Taos. Stylistically, she often centers her subject matter, relating her work to stained glass or altar pieces. Composition is less important than the subject matter or idea being expressed by Rodriguez. Her color choices are bright and vibrant. Rodriguez hides messages and ideas throughout her paintings which function as visual puns and humorous messages.  Quotes  \\"The fear of death and its denial is the first denial--triggering a chain of denials. The fear of death engenders all deceit and ends by actually preventing one from living. The daily remembrances of death gives one great personal power--the power to distinguish between the important and the trivial. It teaches one to love life, to celebrate it and respect its fragility. It makes one treasure loved ones and to appreciate the simplest joys.\\" \\"Skeletons have always been paramount in my work. Bones stand for my belief in deep democracy--everybody has the same bones and death comes to us all.\\" References  External links  * * Remarkable Women of Taos \\"What's in the Water?\\" Rodriguez is the first artist interviewed.

He is the brother of well-known Serbian painter Nade≈æda Petroviƒá. Rastko Petroviƒá was a contemporary and friend of Guillaume Apollinaire, James Joyce, Saint-John Perse, Picasso, Max Ernst and others. Biography He was born on 3 March 1898 in Belgrade, the ninth child of Dimitrije Petroviƒá, art professor, and his wife Mileva Petroviƒá (n√©e Zoriƒá), teacher. Rastko Petroviƒá's godfather was a writer Ja≈°a Tomiƒá. Petroviƒá's house in Belgrade was a gathering place for leading Serbian intellectuals, writers, artists, and historians, and young Rastko had an opportunity to meet many of them, including playwright Ivo Vojnoviƒá, fiction writer Ivo ƒÜipiko, Petar Koƒçiƒá, and others. During World War I, as a 17-year- old high school graduate, he took part in the heroic, fighting retreat of the Serbian Army over the Albanian mountains. After serving in the Serbian Army in World War I, he went to college in Nice, studied law in Paris, where he established contacts with the artistic elite of that period, including Pablo Picasso, Andr√© Breton and Paul √âluard. After graduating in 1920, he returned to Serbia. There he joined the diplomatic corps in 1923 and served in Rome, Italy, and from the end of 1935 to the beginning of 1945 in the United States, Chicago and Washington, D.C. His nine years as a diplomat of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the United States are by far the most significant period of his career. As a diplomat of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Rastko Petroviƒá travelled extensively throughout Europe, the Levant, Turkey, Africa, Mexico, Cuba, and Canada. Although he left a travelogue after every journey, there is nothing about his understanding of Europe to be found in his letters from Spain and Italy. There is a letter from Rome, in which he writes about a dinner party during which the works of Marcel Proust are discussed. He wrote for a cosmopolitan folk who had their own memories of Toledo or the Vatican, whose members studied at European schools of higher learning, served in diplomatic corps of its major capitals, reported from Europe as foreign correspondents, or travelled there for their own personal intellectual enrichment. But not everyone, however, would have heard of Proust outside France in the early 1920s; it was something worth writing about from Rome while his novels were being translated. As with others of his generation, Petroviƒá felt at home in Europe, somewhat conceited perhaps. While travelling through Libya in 1928, Rastko Petroviƒá wrote that Africa has no end and is bereft of people. \\"One can travel through it for days on end and never meet a single living soul. Everything I thought could be reduced to: not being a European, what conceit! Not to be a European, what conceit! And still, I know that only a European can fecundate such ground and whole continents!\\" Before entering the diplomatic service, Rastko Petroviƒá was a poet and novelist. His first novel, Burleska gospodina Peruna boga groma (The Burlesque of Mr. Perun the God of Thunder) was published in Belgrade in 1921 accompanied with rave reviews. \\"Petroviƒá erases the boundaries between real and unreal, between the possible and the impossible, between logic and nonsense, for the purpose of shocking the reader and exploring new possibilities in literature,\\" one critic wrote. At the time he was friends with poets Milan Dedinac and Marko Ristiƒá, the founder of the Belgrade surrealist movement. It was only fitting that Petroviƒá would continue to write upon arriving as vice-consul in Chicago on 14 November 1935. His most important literary work in America was the completion of his novel Dan ≈°esti (The Sixth Day), which he began writing in Libya almost three years earlier (1932). He was also the first Serbian writer to write a novel set in America. The second part of the novel takes place in Washington and New England. The tenuous connection with the first part, which deals with the heroic and traumatic retreat of the Serbian army through the mountains of Albania in 1915, is maintained only through three characters, the protagonist of both parts, Stevan Papa-Katiƒá; a woman he met during his trek through Albania; and a young woman at whose birth he assisted on the same journey twenty-three years ago. Petroviƒá's other work from America, a play called \\"The Sibinian Women\\", was written in New England and perhaps for that reason has fewer ties with the author's homeland. Unfortunately, he tells us even less about America, unless we consider a plot about a murder, so prevalent on television nowadays, as being typically an American state of affairs. However weak the plot may appear, Petroviƒá shows how a privileged few live a seemingly useless life and die an even more senseless death. Based at the Royal Yugoslav embassy in Washington, D.C. during World War II, he quit the diplomatic service after the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed, and stayed privately in the United States after the war, like many of his Serbian colleagues who left the service and stayed in the West (Jovan Duƒçiƒá, Milan Rakiƒá and Milo≈° Crnjanski). Petroviƒá died in America on the 15th of August 1949. In 1986, after official recognition, Petroviƒá's remains were returned to his homeland and buried in Belgrade's Novo Groblje. Works Petroviƒá wanted to establish a connection between the old folk tradition and the new literary trends. He turned his attention for a while to lyric poetry, looking for forgotten poetic processes which would enable him to discover new, universal aesthetics. He also studied painting, ethnology and psychology. * Burleska gospodina Peruna boga groma (The Burlesque of Mr. Perun the God of Thunder, a novel, 1921) * Otkrovenje (Revelation, poems, 1922) * Sa silama nemerljivim (With Immovable Forces, a novel, 1927) * Afrika (Africa, a travelogue, 1930) * Ljudi govore (People Speak, a novel, 1931) * Dan ≈°esti (The Sixth Day, a novel, 1941) References Most of the biographical material has been translated and adapted into English from: (2.)

They are often eaten as snacks or as a dessert, but are also commonly eaten as a breakfast.  History  A vegan lemon poppyseed muffin Americans have been preparing muffins since at least the 19th century, using a wide variety of products to add flavor to the basic batter of flour, sugar and butter (generally not prepared with eggs and by definition unleavened). Fruits and even some garden vegetables have served as flavorings. Poppy seeds were already popular in most parts of the world for their taste and texture--as well as the narcotic characteristics of the opium poppy plant they are harvested from. In modern times, growing poppy seeds is a difficult business for American farmers, due to the risk of heroin production. Other countries have fewer difficulties with permitting the growth of poppies for the seeds alone, which have very low (but still present) levels of opium alkaloids, such as morphine. As other countries began imitating the American muffin, the occasional use of poppy seeds to flavor them spread as well.  Drug content  Although poppy seeds cannot be used as a narcotic due to very low levels of opium alkaloids,\\"Poppy law\\" on Erowid.org. they do have enough that drug tests are often fooled and give out false positives after an otherwise drug-free person consumes just a few poppyseed muffins.Poppy-seeds: codeine, morphine and urinanalysis Because of this, all poppyseed pastries place the person who consumes them prior to a test at a high risk of being inaccurately considered a drug user.BBC News - Tourists warned of UAE drug laws This defense could, of course, easily be used by someone who had indeed been using heroin or another poppy-based narcotic prior to being tested, and therefore is not generally defensible in court. Though any poppyseed-based dish (such as curry) could cause such a false positive, in American culture, poppyseed muffins and bagels are more prevalent for risk of an inaccurate diagnosis of drug use.

On 17 April, she was honoured with a ceremonial funeral. Due to polarised opinion about her achievements and legacy, reaction to her death was mixed throughout Britain and evoked contrasting praise, criticism, and even celebration. The funeral, including a formal procession through Central London, followed by a church service at St Paul's Cathedral, cost around ¬£3.6 million including ¬£3.1 million for security. The funeral was notable for the attendance of the reigning monarch, Elizabeth II; each of her four successors as prime minister also paid homage. Thatcher's body was subsequently cremated at Mortlake Crematorium. Thatcher's ashes were buried at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, London, in a private ceremony on 28 September 2013, alongside those of her husband Denis.  Illness and death  Thatcher suffered several small strokes in 2002 and was advised by her doctors not to engage in any more public speaking. On 23 March, she announced the cancellation of her planned speaking engagements and that she would accept no more. But despite her illness, she pre-recorded a eulogy for the funeral of Ronald Reagan in June 2004, and attended her 80th birthday celebration in 2005 with the Queen and 650 other guests in attendance. However, her health continued to decline; she was briefly hospitalised in 2008 after feeling unwell during a dinner, and again after falling and fracturing her arm in 2009. In June 2009, her daughter Carol spoke to the press of her mother's struggle with dementia. Floral tributes outside Thatcher's birthplace Thatcher died at 11:28 BST (10:28 UTC) on 8 April 2013, at the Ritz Hotel, Piccadilly, after suffering a stroke. She had been staying in a suite there since December 2012, after having difficulty using the stairs at her house in Chester Square. She had been invited to stay at the Ritz by its owners David and Frederick Barclay, who were long-time supporters. Lord Bell, Thatcher's spokesman, confirmed her death to the Press Association, who issued the first wire report to newsrooms at 12:47 BST (11:47 UTC). The Union Jack was flown at half-mast at Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, Parliament and other palaces, and flowers were laid outside her home.  Funeral   Planning  Planning for the funeral began in 2009. The committee was originally chaired by Sir Malcolm Ross, the former Master of the Royal Household. Following the 2010 general election that brought the coalition government into power, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude was made the new chairman of the committee; the codename given to the plans was changed to True Blue from Iron Bridge to give it \\"a more Conservative feel\\". Details of Thatcher's funeral had been agreed with her in advance. Specifically, Thatcher had chosen the hymns and stipulated that the prime minister of the day would deliver a reading from the Bible. She had previously vetoed a state funeral; reasons included cost, parliamentary deliberation, and that it suggested similar stature to Winston Churchill (with which she disagreed). Instead with her and her family's agreement, she received a ceremonial funeral, including military honours, a guard of honour, and a service at St Paul's Cathedral, London. The arrangements were similar to those for the Queen Mother in 2002 and for Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, except with greater military honours as she had been a former head of government. Thatcher's body was cremated after the funeral, in accordance with her wishes. Some of Thatcher's supporters expressed disappointment that she would not be given a full state funeral. However, Peter Oborne in The Daily Telegraph argued that the scale of the ceremony amounted to a de facto state funeral and disagreed with the status of a ceremonial funeral. Oborne contended that the Queen's attendance might be seen as \\"partisan\\", since she had not attended Labour prime minister Clement Attlee's funeral. The scale and the cost to the taxpayer of the funeral, inaccurately estimated before the event at up to ¬£10 million in total, was also criticised by public figures including the Bishop of Grantham, Lord Prescott and George Galloway. Thatcher's family agreed to meet part of the cost of the funeral, unspecified but thought to cover transport, flowers and the cremation. The government would fund the remaining costs, including security. After the event, it was reported by 10 Downing Street that in fact the total public spending on the funeral was ¬£3.6 million, of which ¬£3.1 million (86 per cent) had been the costs of police and security. Anticipating possible protests and demonstrations along the route, police mounted one of the largest security operations since the 2012 Summer Olympics. Against the backdrop of the bombings at the Boston Marathon two days earlier, it was announced that over 4,000 police officers would be deployed. In the event, the crowds were peaceful, with supporters drowning out most of the scattered protests with cheers and applause. A few hundred people turned up to protest at Ludgate Circus, some shouting and others turning their backs, with other protesters picketing along the route.  Day of the funeral and aftermath  Security checks (before the service) in the early hours of 17 April 2013 The coffin bearing her remains being carried by a gun carriage thumbuprightalt=PhotographGravestone at the Royal Hospital Chelsea ( ) Flags along Whitehall were lowered to half-mast at 08:00, and as a rare mark of respect the chimes of the Palace of Westminster Great Clock, including Big Ben, were silenced from 09:45 for the duration of the funeral. At the Tower of London, a 105 mm gun fired every 60 seconds during the procession. Muffled bells tolled at St Margaret's Church at Westminster Abbey, and at St Paul's. The funeral cort√®ge commenced at the Houses of Parliament, where Thatcher's coffin had lain overnight in the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft beneath St Stephen's Hall at the Palace of Westminster. The funeral procession was as follows: * From the Palace of Westminster, a motor hearse travelled down Whitehall, across Trafalgar Square and down the Strand and Aldwych * At St Clement Danes, the central church of the RAF, at the eastern end of the Strand the coffin was transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery * The cort√®ge continued along Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill before it arrived at St Paul's Cathedral * At St Paul's, the coffin was carried into the Cathedral by members of the Armed Forces and borne down the nave preceded by her grandchildren, Michael and Amanda, who carried cushions bearing Thatcher's insignia of the Order of the Garter and the Order of Merit The bidding (introductory words) was given by the Dean of St Paul's, David Ison. Granddaughter Amanda gave the first Bible reading; the second reading was given by David Cameron. The Bishop of London also gave an address. It was expected that there would be about 2,300 mourners within St Paul's Cathedral for the funeral. Invitations were decided by the Thatcher family and their representatives, together with the government and the Conservative Party. The guest list included her family and friends; former colleagues including former British Cabinet members; and personal staff who worked closely with her. Invitations were also sent to representatives of some 200 countries, and to all five living presidents of the United States and four British prime ministers. Two current heads of state, 11 serving prime ministers, and 17 serving foreign ministers were present. Queen Elizabeth II led mourners at the funeral. It marked only the second time in the Queen's reign that she attended the funeral of one of her prime ministers, the only other time was for that of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965. Her presence at the funeral was interpreted by some as having elevated \\"the status [of the funeral] to that of state funeral in all but name\\". The Queen and Prince Philip were led in and out of the cathedral by the Lord Mayor of London Roger Gifford, bearing the Mourning Sword. The sword had last been used at Churchill's funeral. Following the church service, the coffin was taken by motor hearse from St Paul's Cathedral to Mortlake Crematorium, where Sir Denis Thatcher had been cremated nearly a decade before. The cremation service was only attended by the immediate family. On 28 September 2013, a private and unpublicised service for Thatcher was held in the All Saints Chapel of the Royal Hospital Chelsea's Margaret Thatcher Infirmary. Afterwards Thatcher's ashes were interred in the grounds of the hospital, next to those of her husband.  Reactions   Family  On 10 April, two days following Thatcher's death, her son Mark spoke of his mother's death on the steps of her Chester Square home. He told a gathering of journalists that his family was \\"proud and equally grateful\\" that her funeral service would be attended by the Queen, whose presence he said her mother would be \\"greatly honored as well as humbled by\\". He expressed gratitude for all the messages of support and condolences from far and wide. Three days later on 13 April her daughter Carol thanked President Obama of the United States and others for their tributes, and all those who had sent messages of sympathy and support.  Domestic  The Union Flag in Jersey lowering at half-mast while the funeral took place Anti-government demonstration in Liverpool while the funeral took place = Political reaction = A Buckingham Palace spokesman reported the Queen's sadness on hearing the news of her death, and that she would be sending a private message to the family. Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader David Cameron cut short a visit to Spain and ordered flags to be flown at half-mast. He issued a statement lamenting Britain's loss of \\"a great prime minister, a great leader, a great Briton\\". The Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, eulogised Thatcher as having defined modern British politics and that, while she may have \\"divided opinion\\" during her time, there would be scant disagreement about \\"the strength of her personality and the radicalism of her politics\\". Leader of the Opposition and Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said that she would be remembered for having \\"reshaped the politics of a whole generation [and moving] the centre ground of British politics\\" and for her stature in the world. He said that, although the Labour Party had disagreed with much of what she did, \\"we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength\\". Sir John Major, her successor as prime minister, credited Thatcher's leadership with turning Britain around in large measure. \\"Her reforms of the economy, trades union law, and her recovery of the Falkland Islands elevated her above normal politics.\\" Former Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown said that even those who disagreed with her would admire her strength of character, her convictions, her view of Britain's place in the world and her contribution to British national life. Scottish National Party leader and First Minister Alex Salmond acknowledged that \\"Margaret Thatcher was a truly formidable prime minister whose policies defined a political generation\\". Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, while expressing sympathy to her family, criticised her policies' effects on Wales. Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas voiced regret that, although Thatcher was the first female prime minister, \\"she did little for women either inside or outside the House of Commons\\". UKIP leader Nigel Farage expressed his sympathy in a tweet, paying homage to \\"a great patriotic lady\\". = Wider reaction = The House of Commons held a special session discussing Thatcher's legacy. While current and former cabinet ministers struck a conciliatory tone in their speeches, some in the Labour Party attacked Thatcher's legacy. Over half of all Labour MPs chose to boycott the tribute to Thatcher, with many saying it would have been hypocritical for them to honour her as their constituents continued to suffer from some of the decisions she made. Retired MP Tony Benn, former London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and Paul Kenny, General Secretary of the GMB trade union, stated that her policies were divisive and her legacy involved \\"the destruction of communities, the elevation of personal greed over social values and legitimising the exploitation of the weak by the strong\\", however Benn did acknowledge some of her personal qualities. Many reactions were unsympathetic, particularly from her opponents. Residents in Orgreave, South Yorkshire, site of the Battle of Orgreave between striking coal miners and police in June 1984, declared that their village had been \\"decimated by Thatcher\\". The AP quoted a number of miners as responding to her death simply with \\"good riddance\\". Chris Kitchen, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, stated that miners would \\"not be shedding a tear for her\\". A mock funeral was held in the pit village of Goldthorpe in South Yorkshire, in which an effigy of Thatcher was burned alongside the word \\"scab\\" spelled out in flowers. Spontaneous street parties were held by some across Britain, comparable to the enthusiasm shown for the assassination of incumbent Prime Minister Spencer Perceval in 1812; celebrations in favour of her death took place in Glasgow, Brixton, Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds, Belfast, Cardiff and elsewhere; Glasgow City Council advised citizens to stay away from street parties organised without their involvement or consent out of safety concerns. A larger demonstration with around 3,000 protesters took place at Trafalgar Square in London on 13 April. Graffiti was posted calling for her to \\"rot in hell\\". Left-wing director Ken Loach suggested privatising her funeral and tendering it for the cheapest bid. The Daily Telegraph website closed comments on all articles related to her death due to brigading by online trolls. The issue of whether to fly the flag at half-mast for her funeral caused controversy for some councils where local feelings remained hostile. The government's national flag protocol dictates that union flags should be lowered to half mast on the funeral days of all former prime ministers; however most Scottish councils did not lower the flag for the funeral. Councils in England that refused to lower the flag included Barnsley, Sheffield and Wakefield in Yorkshire, as well as Coventry in the West Midlands. Whilst business leaders, including Alan Sugar, Richard Branson, Archie Norman and CBI chief John Cridland, credited her for creating a climate favourable to business in Britain, and lifting the UK \\"out of the economic relegation zone\\", the Premier League and the Football League rejected having a minute's silence around the country's football grounds, a move backed by the Football Supporters' Federation and the Hillsborough Family Support Group, the latter in reaction to her perceived lack of interest in uncovering abuse committed by the police during the 1989 disaster. However, Saracens and Exeter Chiefs held a minute's silence for her before their Premiership rugby union games.  International politics  US Secretary of State John Kerry signing the condolence book in London. He praised her in a statement as \\"a transformative leader who broke the glass ceiling in global politics\\". Along with the eulogies and expressions of condolence, there were less than sympathetic reactions in Argentina, due to her role in the Falklands War, and in South Africa, given her opposition to economic sanctions against South Africa. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, described Thatcher as \\"a great model as the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who not only demonstrated her leadership but has given such great hope for many women for equality, gender equality in Parliament\\". The message from Pope Francis \\"recalls with appreciation the Christian values which underpinned her commitment to public service and to the promotion of freedom among the family of nations\\". Barack Obama, President of the United States, lamented the loss of \\"a true friend\\". His statement praised her as \\"an unapologetic supporter of our transatlantic alliance, she knew that with strength and resolve we could win the Cold War and extend freedom's promise\\". Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged Thatcher as having \\"define[d] the age in which she served [as well as] contemporary conservatism itself\\". French President Fran√ßois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel remarked that Thatcher left \\"a deep impression on her country's history\\". Merkel went on to hail Thatcher's belief in the freedom of the individual as having contributed to \\"overcoming Europe's partition and the end of the Cold War\\". Irish President Michael D. Higgins extended his condolences saying: \\"She will be remembered as one of the most conviction-driven British prime ministers who drew on a scholarship that demanded markets without regulation\\" and that \\"her key role in signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement will be recalled as a valuable early contribution to the search for peace and political stability\\". Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny said he was \\"saddened\\" to learn of Thatcher's death, while Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams criticised \\"the great hurt done to the Irish and British people during her time as British prime minister\\", adding: \\"Here in Ireland, her espousal of old draconian militaristic policies prolonged the war and caused great suffering\\". Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said she was \\"an ideologue among pragmatists\\". Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy hailed her as a 20th century landmark and said it was a sad day for Europe. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called her a great statesperson. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed admiration for Thatcher's achievements as a woman. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key praised Thatcher's determination and expressed his \\"[sadness] for her family and Great Britain\\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lamented losing \\"a true friend of the Jewish people and Israel\\". Romanian President Traian BƒÉsescu and the premier and foreign minister of Bulgaria, Marin Raykov, cited her influence on them, and sent their condolences. They recognised Thatcher as a central figure in modern European history, and that her application of the law and economic liberal principles contributed to the downfall of communism in the Eastern Bloc. Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said she was a \\"fearless champion of liberty\\". At the wishes of Thatcher's family, Argentina's president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner was not invited to the funeral. Argentine foreign minister H√©ctor Timerman said that any invitation would have been \\"just another provocation\\". The Argentine ambassador Alicia Castro was invited in line with diplomatic protocol, but declined the invitation. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and South African President Jacob Zuma expressed their \\"deepest sympathies\\". as did Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that Thatcher was \\"a pragmatic, tough and consistent person\\". Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev expressed sadness at the loss of a \\"great\\" politician \\"whose words carried great weight\\".  Social media  Social media played a significant role in the aftermath of her death, with celebrities channelling polarised views about Thatcher on Twitter, and endorsing campaigns and demonstrations. Anti-Thatcher sentiment prompted a campaign on social media networks to bring the song \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" from The Wizard of Oz into the UK Singles Chart, followed by a counter-campaign adopted by Thatcher supporters in favour of the 1979 tongue-in-cheek punk song \\"I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher\\" by the Notsensibles, which had been started by the band's lead singer. On 12 April 2013, \\"Ding-Dong!\\" charted at number 2 across the UK (it made number 1 in Scotland), and \\"I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher\\" at number 35. Radio 1 Controller Ben Cooper said that the station's chart show would not play the No. 2 song but that a portion of it would be aired as part of a news item. Cooper explained that its delicate compromise balanced freedom of speech and sensitivity for a family grieving for a loved one yet to be buried.

The rapid strides in aircraft protection made it necessary to develop an aircraft weapon that would fire projectiles with greater explosive and armor-piercing qualities than smaller caliber weapons. As a result, the 37 mm (1.46 in) T9 automatic gun was developed. It was standardized for aircraft use as the M4 cannon in 1942. The 37 mm gun (1.46 in), M4, used the same high-explosive (M54) and practice (M55A1) projectiles as the 37 mm (1.46 in) antiaircraft gun, M1A2, but different cartridge cases were necessary due to the larger chamber of the M4 gun. The M4 was later replaced by the more powerful 37mm M9 autocannon. Ammunition Ammunition was issued in the form of fixed rounds, consisting of: *H.E.T. shell, M54, with Point-Detonating fuze, M56 *Practice shell, M55A1, with dummy fuze, M50 *A.P. shot, M80. High-explosive Tracer shell, 37 mm, M54 standard right This shell used the M56 point detonating fuze. The complete round weighs 1.99 lb (900 g); as fired, the projectile weighs 1.34 lb (608 g). The 0.16 lb (70 g) charge of M2 powder is a Hercules NG formula of single perforated grains with 0.030 in (0.76 mm) web and gives the projectile the prescribed muzzle velocity of . The M54 used a shell-destroying tracer in addition to the point-detonating fuze. The tracer had a burning time of three seconds at the end of which it set off an igniting relay charge of of Grade A-5 Army Black Powder which ignited a relay pellet that detonated the charge, destroying the shell before ground impact. The bursting charge of tetryl weighed 0.10 lb (45 g), and the alternate Composition \\"A\\" charge weighs 0.105 lb (48 g). The tetryl loading consisted of a 200 gr (13 g) tetryl pellet pressed into the shell cavity under 9,000-10,000 psi (60-70 MPa) pressure and the remainder of the charge of two equal increments pressed under approximately 9,000 psi (60 MPa) pressure. The Composition \\"A\\" bursting charge is loaded in the same manner as the tetryl charge, except that the relay pellet with the Composition \\"A\\" weighs as against for the pellet used with the tetryl load. Practice shell, 37 mm, M55A1 standard This shell was the high-explosive shell modified slightly for practice purposes. It contained a red tracer and a dummy fuze (M50, M50B1, M50B2 or M50B3). The M50 dummy fuze was made from a plastic composition and the M50B1, M50B2 and M50B3 fuzes were made from low carbon steel machined to give the same contour and weight as the point-detonating fuze, M56, used with the M54 projectile. As used in the M4, the complete round weighed 1.99 lb (900 g), and as fired the shell weighed 1.34 lb (610 g). The 0.16 lb (70 g) charge of M2 powder was Hercules NG formula of single perforated grains with a 0.030 in (0.76 mm) web and gave the prescribed muzzle velocity of . Armor-piercing shot, 37 mm, M80 standard The overall length of the 37mm M-74 AP-T (Armor-Piercing shot with Tracer) and M-51 APCBC-T (Armor-Piercing Composite Ballistic-Capped shot with Tracer) armor-piercing projectiles used in the M3A1, M5A1, and M6 tank and antitank guns (37 x 223R mm), was too great to permit their use in the M4 gun. The 37 mm (1.46 in) M80 AP-T shot was developed and standardized. The M80 Armor- Piercing Tracer shot was a monoblock projectile with a tracer element of three seconds burning time. It did not need a fuze or bursting charge. The weight of the complete round was 2.31 lb (1.05 kg), the weight of the AP shot was 1.66 lb (750 g). The propelling charge was 0.15 lb (78 g) of M2 powder of a Hercules NG formula with a single-perforated grain and 0.030 in (0.76 mm) web.

She served as an academic consultant to the television series The Bible, as Papal News Contributor for CBS News, and is a frequent contributor to the National Geographic Channel. A Roman Catholic, Moss has specialized in the study of martyrdom. Her 2012 book Ancient Christian Martyrdom argued that bias against martyrdom had led scholars to think of martyrdom as a phenomenon that spread from one region of the Roman empire to another. Against this, Moss argued that martyrdom developed differently in different contexts. In 2013 her book The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom was published in which she argues that the stories of early Christian martyrdom \\"have been altered ... edited and shaped by later generations of Christians\\" and none of them are \\"completely historically accurate\\". Additionally, she maintains that the Roman authorities did not actively seek out or target Christians, and only for a brief period of no more than twelve years in the first three centuries of Christian history were Christians prosecuted by order of a Roman emperor.Moss 2013, p. 159.

Heatherton is a former professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College who retired following sexual harassment allegations against him. He was an Associate Editor of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. His recent research uses a social brain science approach, which combines theories and methods of evolutionary psychology, social cognition, and cognitive neuroscience to examine social behavior. Research and career Much of Heatherton's work has concentrated on examining the relationship between adolescent smoking and film. His work has helped to shed light on the strong relationship between children witnessing films with smoking characters, and the initiation of adolescent smoking. Along with colleagues, Heatherton has helped to isolate risk factors, including access to movies online and low parental restrictions on film, to an increased likelihood of adolescent smoking.Dalton, M.A., Sargent, J.D., Beach, M., Titus-Ernstoff, L., Gibson, J.J., Ahrens, M.B., Tickle, J., & Heatherton, T.F.

Heatherton has also conducted a great amount of research concerning the risk factors of bulimia nervosa, using the Eating Disorder Inventory. His work has helped to reaffirm perfectionism, low self-esteem, and a negative perceived weight status as risk factors for bulimia, while asserting that age could be a modifier in onset among at-risk individuals.Holm-Denoma, J.M., Gordon, K.H., Bardone, A.M., Vohs, K.D., Abramson, L.Y., Heatherton, T.F., & Joiner, T.E.

He was President of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in 2011. Heatherton's recent work has concentrated on the study of social neuroscience.  Sexual misconduct allegation and retirement  In October 2017, Heatherton was placed on paid leave from Dartmouth as the result of a sexual misconduct investigation launched by Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire attorney general, the Grafton county attorney's and sheriff's offices, and the Hanover police opened a criminal investigation in response. New York University revoked his visiting scholar affiliation with their Department of Psychology. Heatherton's attorneys have released a statement saying that he is cooperating with the investigation and that, \\"he has engaged in no sexual relations with any student.\\" The statement also says that \\"Dr. Heatherton‚Äôs year away from Dartmouth is wholly unrelated to the investigation, as he was awarded a Senior Faculty Grant in October 2016 to facilitate a long-planned sabbatical, and he has utilized it for the 2017-2018 academic year. His sabbatical leave began on July 1, before he learned of the investigation.\\" On June 14, 2018, the President of Dartmouth College announced that the Dean of Faculty recommended that Heatherton's tenure be revoked and that he be terminated, but he elected to retire immediately. He is banned from entering campus property or attending College events. The university has not released any specifics of their investigation; however, a tenured professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis alleged that Heatherton groped her at an academic conference in 2002 while she was still a graduate student.

Books  *In 2006, Drobny published his first book, Inside the House of Money: Top Hedge Fund Traders on Profiting in the Global Markets (John Wiley & Sons, 2006), which defined global macro as a strategy, featuring interviews with some of the top hedge fund managers at the time across the breadth of sub-strategies comprised within the broad strategy of global macro. The revised edition includes a foreword by Niall Ferguson. A partial list of interviewees includes Peter Thiel, Scott Bessent, and Jim Rogers. *In 2010, Drobny published The Invisible Hands: Top Hedge Funds on Bubbles, Crashes and Rethinking Real Money (John Wiley & Sons, 2010), a work born out of the crisis of 2008. In this book, Drobny interviewed macro hedge fund managers who preserved capital or profited through the crisis, focusing on elements of their investment processes that could be incorporated by real money managers (pensions, university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, charitable foundations, and others). The work was named one of the best business books of 2010 by Bloomberg. *The New House of Money (John Wiley & Sons, 2014), Drobny‚Äôs third book, was released on December 3, 2013 through Clocktower Group‚Äôs website as serialized chapters available for free download.

Statistically, abnormal is when the occurrence, frequency or intensity of a behaviour varies statistically significantly, either more or less, from the normal value. This means that theoretically, almost any behaviour could become abnormal in an individual. Less formally, 'abnormal' includes any activity judged to be outside the normal behaviour pattern for animals of that particular class or age. For example, infanticide may be a normal behaviour and regularly observed in one species, however, in another species it might be normal but becomes 'abnormal' if it reaches a high frequency, or in another species it is rarely observed and any incidence is considered 'abnormal'. This list does not include one-time behaviours performed by individual animals that might be considered abnormal for that individual, unless these are performed repeatedly by other individuals in the species and are recognised as part of the ethogram of that species. Most abnormal behaviours can be categorised collectively (e.g., eliminative, ingestive, stereotypies), however, many abnormal behaviours fall debatedly into several of these categories and categorisation is therefore not attempted in this list. Some abnormal behaviours may be related to environmental conditions (e.g. captive housing) whereas others may be due to medical conditions. The list does not include behaviours in animals that are genetically modified to express abnormal behaviour (e.g. Reeling mice). A polar bear performing stereotyped pacing. An Asiatic elephant performing stereotyped rocking and trunk swinging. *Abnormal sexual behaviour; various types. *Activity anorexia; a condition where animals exercise excessively while simultaneously reducing their food intake. *Adjunctive behaviour; an activity reliably accompanying another response that has been produced by a stimulus, especially when the stimulus is presented according to a temporally defined schedule.A dog chasing its tail *Barbering, or fur and whisker trimming; removing the whiskers or fur of another animal. *Broodiness; sitting on a clutch of eggs to incubate them. (Broodiness is undesirable and considered abnormal in modern commercial egg-laying hens.) *Cannibalism; eating the flesh or internal organs of another animal of the same species.McGlone, J.J., Sells, J., Harris, S. and Hurst, R.J. Cannibalism in growing pigs: Effects of tail docking and housing system on behavior, performance and immune function.Texas Tech Univ. Agric. Sci. Tech. Rep. No. T-5-283 *Coprophagia; eating faeces. *Cribbing or crib-biting; grabbing a solid object such as a fence with the incisors, arching the neck, pulling against the object, and sucking in air. *Depression; behaviours associated with a state of low mood and aversion to activity. *Excessive vocalisation; vocalising more frequently than expected. *Excessive aggression; aggressive acts that are more frequent or of greater intensity than expected. *Excessive/submissive urination (Polyuria); urinating more frequently than expected or under conditions where it would not be expected *Excessive licking; excessive licking of the floor, wall or other environmental features. *Fainting; a transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery. *Feather pecking; one bird repeatedly pecking or pulling at the feathers of another. *Feather- plucking (Pterotillomania); birds chewing, biting or plucking their own feathers with their beak, resulting in damage to the feathers and occasionally the skin. *Forced moulting; commercial egg-laying hens losing their feathers due to the deliberate removal of food and water for several days. *Geophagia; eating soil or sand. *Herbivory in carnivorous animals; eating plant material by an animal that is considered to usually be meat-eating. *Infanticide; killing of young offspring by a mature animal of its own species.Hausfater, G. and Hrdy, S.B., (1984). Infanticide: Comparative and evolutionary perspectives New York, Aldine. *Learned helplessness; failing to respond even though there are opportunities for the animal to help itself by avoiding unpleasant circumstances or by gaining positive rewards. *Lignophagia; eating wood. *Obsessive-compulsive disorder; a specific, unnecessary action or series of actions that is repeated more often than would normally be expected. *Osteophagy; chewing or eating bones. *Pica; eating materials other than normal food. *Polydipsia; excessive drinking. *Savaging; overt aggression directed to newborn offspring by a mother animal, often including cannibalistic infanticide. *Self-cannibalism (Autophagy, Autosarcophagy); an animal eating itself. *Self-injury; an animal injuring its own body tissues.Baker, K., Bloomsmith, M., Griffis, C. and Gierhart, M., (2003).

He was active during the transition from Neoclassicism to Functionalism and many of his works show influence from Art Deco. His factory for the distillery De Danske Spritfabrikker at Aalborg's harbour front was declared a Danish Industrial Heritage Site in 2009. Other works include the headquarters of publisher Guttenberghus (now Egmont Media), now partly converted into the Danish Film Institute, and the Richshuset in Copenhagen.

He attended Technical School in Copenhagen from 1894 to 1906 and studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1905 until 1911. He won the Academy's small gold medal in 1913 and worked as a draughtsman and executing architect from 1905 until 1917, first for Hack Kampmann and later Gotfred Tvede. He traveled in Germany in 1910 and in Italy in 1913 on a scholarship from the Art Academy. In 1816 he received the Theophilus Hansens Legat. Career Cock-Claussen worked for De Danske Spritfabrikker (English: The Danish Distillers), designing numerous facilities around the country, including the factories in Hobro (1925), Aalborg (1929‚Äì30), Randers, Slagelse, Roskilde (1941) and Copenhagen (in collaboration with Preben Hansen).

(15 January 1852 - 20 October 1890) was a Catholic missionary of the White Fathers who became the Vicar Apostolic of Tanganyika. Early years L√©once Bridoux was born on 15 January 1852 in Henin-Li√©tard, France. His father was Sub Saharan African and his mother was French. He joined the White Fathers (Society of the Missionaries of Africa) in 1873.On 24 October 1874 he was ordained a priest of the White Fathers. Bridoux became Superior of the Major seminary of Carthage in Tunisia. Brothers in arms Charles Lavigerie, the founder of the White Fathers in 1868 and the White Sisters in 1869, had great influence on missionary activity in Africa. He came to believe that an African Catholic kingdom should be founded in the east of Central Africa as a refuge for escaped slaves and a center for converting the surrounding peoples. In May 1883 a mission head proposed the idea of brothers who would train the converts to defend their missions, as an alternative to hiring mercenaries. Bridoux was asked to review the rules of orders such as the old Knights of Malta, and in his report he proposed that brothers-in-arms should be employed for defense, under the direction of the Fathers. Lavigerie began thinking of directly using the knights of the Order of Malta. However, he was not able to get support from the grand master and the idea was abandoned. Bishop Bridoux was asked to succeed Bishop Jean-Baptiste-Fr√©zal Charbonnier, who died at Karema in Tanganyika on 16 March 1888. He was appointed Titular Bishop of Utica and Vicar Apostolic of Tangyanika on 15 June 1888. He was ordained as bishop on 8 July 1888 by Cardinal Lavigerie in the chapel of the nuns of Zion in Paris. Bridoux left Marseille on 17 July 1888 destined for Zanzibar accompanied by six missionaries, including Antonin Guillermain. Bridoux arrived at the station of Mpala on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika in January 1889. He found a dispute in progress between Father Fran√ßois Coulbois, who had become head of the mission when Charbonnier died, and L√©opold Louis Joubert, who was in charge of defense and civil affairs. Coulbois did not recognize that Joubert had civil authority, and had imposed tight restrictions on his actions. Bridoux confirmed that Joubert was both civil and military leader, but said that military operations must be purely defensive. Joubert moved to St Louis de Murumbi, some distance away, to avoid identification of his soldiers with the mission. In January 1889 the Mpala mission was cut off from the outside world by the Abushiri Revolt against the Germans in Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam. The mission suffered from repeated and deadly raids. Around the end of May 1890 a group of Arabs prepared to cross the Lukuga River about to the north of Mpala. Some skirmishing occurred between the Arabs and the mission's African forces before Joubert could reach the scene. The Arabs tried to negotiate with the missionaries, saying they would not harm the mission if the priests abandoned Joubert. Bridoux refused. It seemed that serious fighting was going to break out, when a storm arose that destroyed some of the Arab fleet and forced them to withdraw. Bridoux died on 20 October 1890.

Archaeological Survey of India has listed this basadi in the complex in the list of \\"Must See\\" Indian Heritage.  History  The town of Lakkundi was known as Lokkigundi in medieval times, the town was of considerable importance during the 11-12th century A.D. Western Chalukya rule. The Brahma Jinalaya was built in 1007 CE by Attimabbe, wife of Nagadeva, who served as general under both Taila II and Satyashraya Irivabedanga (997-1008 A.D.). Satyasraya Irivabedanga had the title ‚ÄòSarvavarnadharmadhanu‚Äô ‚Äì meaning bow that respects all religions, without discrimination. The temple represents the second phase of Kalyani Chalukyas art. It is said that Attimabbe donated 1,500 jewel- studded statues of thirthankaras and 1,000 copies of the manuscript of Ponna‚Äôs ‚ÄòSantipurana‚Äô written on palm-leaves book. With the waning of their power, in 1191 A.D., the noted Hoysala empire king Veera Ballala II made this town an important garrison. In 12th century, Chaturmukh Bharma was installed by villagers giving the temple the name Brahma Jinalaya. Historical records note that there were 5 Jain temples in the region but only this temple survives.  Architecture  Kirtimukha wall relief The open mantapa According to the art historian Adam Hardy, the architectural style of the temple can be classified as \\"Later Chalukya style, mainstream Lakkundi school of mid-11th century with late 11th century superstructure (shikhara)\\". The temple has single shrine (ekakuta vimana) connected to a closed mantapa hall via a vestibule (sukanasi or ardhamantapa) that is connected to another, open mantapa. This temple is famous for its architecture and considered one of the finest example of Western Chalukya architecture. The temple has a garbhagriha, an antarala and a closed navaranga, and an open pillared mandapa. Over the garbhagriha is raised a five storeyed nirandhara vimana with a square griva and sikhara. Above the cornice of these arched niches at regular intervals is a seated Jaina figure. The ceilings are plain and pillers are well decorated. The open mandapa is supported by 32 pillars and pilasters. According to art critic Percy Brown, these units are found commonly in all Western Chalukya temples. The building material is soapstone, which according to Percy Brown became the standard in later Hoysala architecture as well. According to art historians Henry Cousens and Om Prakash, the most conspicuous feature of the Western Chalukya temples is the decrease in the size of masonry and the resulting decrease in the overall height of the temples compared to those built by the Badami Chalukyas at Pattadakal. This was a result of a shift in the basic building material, from sandstone to the more workable soapstone (Chloritic Shist). In the coming decades, this transformation was to lead Vesara architecture toward increased ornamentation and articulation. Cousens categorizes the tower over the shrine as Dravidian (south Indian) but historian Kamath feels it is more Vesara because each tier are encrusted with motifs that make the tower more \\"curvilinear\\". According to Cousens, the overall structure with its well proportioned tiers and finial (amalaka, kalasha) give the superstructure a \\"majestic\\" look. Above the cornice are circular niches, each of which holds the image of a Jain saint (Jaina) in relief, with a kirtimukha decoration above. The walls of the shrine have pilasters, with the spaces between them containing, in relief, pavilions, and miniature decorative towers (aedicula) on slender half pilasters. Some miniature towers have niches below them. Overall, decorative ornamentation is taken to a new level compared to earlier temples.  Sculpture  There are three notable freestanding sculptures in the temple. An image of Mahavira that is a little over 4 feet tall, made of black polished stone and seated on a \\"lion throne\\" (simhaasana) is found outside the temple. Originally this idol was housed as original mulnayak of temple. Neminatha is the mulnayak of the temple placed in the inner sanctum of the temple with yaksha and yakshi on either side. There is a beautiful sculpture of seven hooded Parshva in Kayotsarga position with yakshi and yaksha on both sides. The sculpture of Padmavati sitting with left knee upright besides Parshva depicts Goddess with goad and noose in right and left upper arms respectively and the lower hands are in varadamudra with fruit. Cousens feels it may have been taken out and left there. The saint has an attendant on either side, holding a chowri (a type of brush) in one hand a fruit in another.

Gosling is a personality and social psychologist with interests in social perception, cross-species, and trends in the history of psychology. His work in social perception examines how people form impressions on others through their behavior, appearance, and physical environment, while his work with cross-species examines how animals can lead to theories of personality and social psychology. For instance, he studied individual differences in personality and social behaviors, and how personality traits are portrayed and described in a number of different species including humans, hyenas, dogs, and cats. In general, Gosling's research pertains to evolutionary and ecological principles. He holds a PhD from the University of California at Berkeley, and is currently a professor within the Department of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. Research Social perception Gosling's work on social perception seeks to examine the fundamental processes of impression formation through everyday environments. It is hypothesized that much can be explained about a person from a collection of various environmental cues. These cues consist of self- and other- directed identity claims, and interior and exterior behavioral residue, both of which can be found in one‚Äôs home, bedroom, work environment, and even one's personal online space.Gosling, S. D., Ko, S., Mannarelli, T., & Morris, M. E. (2002). A room with a cue: Personality judgments based on offices and bedrooms. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82, 379-398. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.82.3.379 Gosling's work also investigates whether those impressions are correct and representative of the individual. Much of his work focuses on consensus between observers, accuracy of the observers' perceptions, perception agreement between the observer and the individual,Evans, D. C., Gosling, S. D., & Carroll, A. (2008). What elements of an online social networking profile predict target-rater agreement in personality impressions. Proceedings of the International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, 1-6. Retrieved from: http://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICWSM/2008/ICWSM08-013.pdf and stereotyping. A considerable amount of information can be gathered about another person by observing his or her belongings found in their personal living space, including both their physical and virtual world. While it may be expected that observed individuals may manipulate their personal spaces, it is difficult to obtain a pristine impression even if one attempts to. Furthermore, most individuals desire to be perceived as they actually are rather than as their ideal selves. Although consensus among people tends to vary, most people tend to be relatively accurate in their personality predictions based on others‚Äô personal spaces. Stereotypes can play a helpful role in accuracy when there is slight truth to the assumption as well as when the observer correctly guesses the gender of the individual. Cross-species His research on animals focuses on developing animal models for further research in personality, social, and health psychology, as well as gaining an understanding of the general processes of personality perception from the basis of perceptions of animal personality. Animal models are particularly useful because they allow for studies that could not be conducted with human beings. There are three stages of assessing personality in non-human animals: The first stage is to assess whether it is possible to assess personality in non-human animals, the second is to develop methods of testing on the animals, and the third stage is to address questions related to personality, social, and health psychology.

Albrecht played high school basketball in his hometown of Crown Point, Indiana. He played his undergraduate college career for the Michigan Wolverines. He is most well known for his 17-point first half performance off the bench for the 2012‚Äì13 Wolverines in the championship game of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He won Big Ten Conference regular season championships with the 2013‚Äì14 Wolverines and 2016‚Äì17 Boilermakers. Early life At age five, Michael Albrecht, son of Tammy and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Albrecht, received his first baseball spikes and refused to take them off, earning his now famous nickname. Chuck now runs a summer basketball camp at which Spike assists. Albrecht attended Taft Middle School in Crown Point before attending Crown Point High School where he averaged 21 points, five assists, three steals and four rebounds as a senior in 2011. Albrecht committed to Michigan on April 6, 2012. Albrecht led Northfield Mount Hermon School to the 2012 New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) Class AAA Boys' Basketball Tournament, defeating future Michigan teammate Mitch McGary's Brewster Academy in the semifinals. Albrecht was awarded the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the tournament. Albrecht was a former Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teammate of McGary and future Michigan teammate Glenn Robinson III. Albrecht's father was college teammates with Zack Novak's father; a generation later, when Spike Albrecht was an incoming freshman, Zack Novak was Michigan's captain during the 2011-12 season. College career The 2011‚Äì12 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team had been co-champions of 2011‚Äì12 Big Ten Conference, but lost both of its co-captains, Zack Novak and Stu Douglass, to graduation and three players as transfers. The team was returning a nucleus of All-Big Ten players Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway, Jr. In Albrecht's role with the 2012‚Äì13 Wolverines team, he never scored more than 7 points in a game before the NCAA Tournament. In the regional finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13‚Äì0 lead and never led by less than 10 the rest of the game. Several players had career-highs in the game, including Albrecht who had 7 points and 3 steals. The national championship rounds were held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. In the April 6 national semifinal against Syracuse, Michigan emerged with its thirty-first victory, the most since the 1992‚Äì93 team went 31‚Äì5. The bench contributed 22 points, including 6 from Albrecht, who raised his NCAA tournament total to 5-for-5 on three-point shots. Michigan advanced to the April 8, 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament championship game where the team lost to Midwest number one seed Louisville by an 82-76 margin despite 17 points, including 4-for-5 three-point shooting, from Albrecht in the game. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Albrecht made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Trey Burke. When The New York Times Sports page did a year in review, Albrecht's picture appeared with a feature story about his 17-point performance. NBC Sports journalist Rob Dauster described the performance as \\"arguably the most memorable half of basketball you'll ever see\\". By the end of the first half of the game, Albrecht had tied Sam Cassell by making his first 9 three-point shots in his NCAA tournament games that season, and USA Today described Albrecht's place in history as \\"amongst the most unexpected NCAA heroes in history\\". Following the championship game, Albrecht gained notoriety for tweeting with reigning Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover model and Michigan fan Kate Upton. He thanked her for her attendance at the Georgia Dome. Albrecht established a career high with 6 assists as Michigan defeated Houston Baptist by 54 points on December 7, 2013. On January 22, 2014, against (#10 AP Poll/Coaches' Poll) Iowa, Albrecht made his first career start, posting new career highs of 7 assists and 4 steals, tying a career high with 3 rebounds and helping Michigan defeated consecutive ranked opponents for the first time since the 1996‚Äì97 team. Albrecht started in place of Derrick Walton who had the flu. During the Michigan‚ÄìMichigan State rivalry game on January 25 against the (#3) 2013‚Äì14 Spartans at the Breslin Center, the Michigan State fans heckled Albrecht when he shot free throws with Justin Bieber chants. Michigan clinched its first outright (unshared) Big Ten Conference championship since 1985‚Äì86. The 2013‚Äì14 team advanced to the elite eight round of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament before being eliminated by Kentucky. Albrecht was named co-captain of the 2014‚Äì15 team along with Caris LeVert. On November 29, he contributed a career-high 7 assists against Nicholls State. Then on December 2, Albrecht posted a new career high with 9 assists and broke a 63-63 deadlock with a 31 seconds remaining to lead Michigan to a 68-65 victory over Syracuse. On December 6 in an upset loss against NJIT Highlanders, Albrecht raised his streak of assists without a turnover to 19, but Albrecth had 4 turnovers on December 9 against the EMU Eagles. On January 3, 2015 against Purdue, Albrecht tied his career high with 17 points. On February 1 Albrecht tallied a career-high 18-points in the rivalry game against Michigan State. The March 3 double-overtime loss against Northwestern marked Albrecht's 8th consecutive double-digit scoring game as he picked up the scoring slack in the absence of Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton, who missed their 11th and 9th consecutive games. On March 7 against Rutgers, the streak ended, but Albrecht posted a career-high 9 assists. In April 2015, Albrecht had offseason surgery on his right hip to correct for a genetic condition that may also necessitate left hip surgery. On December 2, Albrecht was named an Allstate Good Works Team nominee. On December 11, 2015, Albrecht announced he would sit out the rest of the season for the 2015‚Äì16 Wolverines team due to injuries. He will concentrate on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery this past summer. During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014‚Äì15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A&M;, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach). It was announced on May 3, 2016, that Albrecht would play his final year of collegiate basketball at Purdue University.

She was born into the Maliseet Nation and she is a member of Kingsclear First Nation in New Brunswick, Canada. Mihku Paul currently resides in Portland, Maine where she teaches creative writing at the Maine Women Writers Collection at the University of New England. Published works Mihku Paul's first chapbook, 20th Century PowWow Playland, was published by Bowman Books in Greenfield, New York in 2012. The poems describe Maliseet homeland, also known as Wolastoqiyik, and Paul's own thoughts on the rights and continuation of indigenous people in the northeast. This poem, as her most popular, is known for giving a voice to the African American community and the discrimination they face, although this was not her main goal of these poems. Some of her more popular poems include The Water Road, Mother Tongue, and Genocide and Me. A number of poems also address Paul's dissatisfaction with the education she received in the Maine public school system. One of her most famous works would be Jefferson Street School also in 20th Century PowWow Playland. In this piece, Paul speaks as a \\"kindergarten captive\\" who is forced to memorize and recite the \\"invader's language\\" and the biased culture that was present. Mihku Paul has also been published in magazines including Cabildo Quarterly Online. Paul has recently been credited with writing a chapter in Transforming Our Practices which is a teach pedagogy text that focuses on Indigenous educational paradigms. Visual arts Mihku Paul combines her poetry with visual art, creating works in pen and ink, watercolor, gouache, and mixed media collage. Although she never had any formal education in the visual arts field, she looks to support her identity through her artistic values. Paul's first multi-media exhibit was a 2010 installation at the Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor, Maine, entitled \\"Look Twice: The Waponahki in Image & Verse.‚Äù The poems that are published in the anthology Dawnland Voices were paired with photographs and her own drawings. She looked to use this piece as a way to redirect the viewers objective thoughts on Native American life and history. Her other pieces, which include medicine wheel paintings have been auctioned off for fundraising to support arts in the schools and by the Sierra Club to support local and regional projects.  Activism  During her experience within the educational system off of her Maliseet reservation, she dealt with racism and discrimination. Paul looked to enhance the experience within education with the inclusion of Native Americans as people as well as their history. In Portland, Maine, she looked to work with the educational system and schools to spread the learning and understanding of Native Americans through storytelling and curriculum enhancements. She often speaks on issues regarding her experiences at different schools and events. Paul spoke at an event hosted by the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine Wabanaki REACH, Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth & Reconciliation Commission, and United to End Genocide. This event was called \\"Genocide & Maine: Shining the Light of Truth\\" and focused on making invisible genocide visible, make what is silenced about genocide heard, and motivate the development of awareness and action to face the challenges that affect the people of Maine.

McCaskey (April 27, 1919 ‚Äì April 8, 2003) was the Chairman of the Chicago Bears. Military career Upon graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, McCaskey served in the 80th Division of the United States Army during World War II for two-and-a-half years. Though he was later injured, he refused the Purple Heart, and was subsequently awarded the Bronze Star Medal and a combat infantry badge. Personal life After the war, McCaskey became a salesman and a singer in a band, though lost out to Frank Sinatra to join the Harry James Band as a singer, and in 1943, he married Virginia Halas, daughter of the Chicago Bears' coach George Halas. However, George Halas expressed his doubts about McCaskey, sending two \\"agents\\", Bert Bell and Art Rooney, owners of the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively, to inspect McCaskey. Relationship with Brian Piccolo The summer before McCaskey officially joined the Bears he befriended the Bears player Brian Piccolo, and the two remained close friends until Piccolo's death of cancer in 1970. As the story goes, he was the person behind the idea to put Piccolo and Gale Sayers in the same room - the first interracial roommates in team history. After Piccolo's death, McCaskey wrote the famous speech that was immortalized in the movie \\"Brian's Song\\": \\"I love Brian Piccolo and I'd like all of you to love him too. Tonight when you hit your knees, please ask God to love him.\\" He was also long time contributor to the Brian Piccolo Cancer Research Fund. Chairman of the Board In 1967, McCaskey became vice president and treasurer of the Bears, and became chairman of the board in 1983 after George Halas' death. The following year, McCaskey gave the team's control to his son, Michael. In 1999, McCaskey relinquished his position as chairman of the board to Michael, who was promoted after various incidents occurred, such as the botched hiring of Dave Wannstedt's replacement and failed attempt to get a new stadium. Death On April 8, 2003, McCaskey died in his Des Plaines, Illinois home; he had been in declining health, and was survived by his wife and eleven children. At his funeral, a \\"plaintive piano rendition\\" of the Bears fight song \\"Bear Down, Chicago Bears\\" was played. McCaskey left a lasting impact on the Bears, such as befriending Brian Piccolo, and placing him with Gale Sayers in the same room, making them the first interracial roommates. McCaskey wrote a speech dedicated to Piccolo that was recited by Sayers after being awarded the George S. Halas Courage Award, which was later memorialized in the film Brian's Song, which McCaskey was a consultant for. To honor McCaskey during the 2003 season, the Bears added an orange shamrock-shaped patch to their jerseys with his initials \\"EWM\\".

In 1888 an abridged version of one volume was published. The book was reissued by the publisher Flammarion in 1938, then by √âditions du Trident in 1986. In 2012, it was reissued by the publishing house KontreKulture, run by the nationalist Equality and Reconciliation political group. La France juive became a major success and achieved great fame. Its success was due in part to the inclusion of a list of names of famous people against whom the author made accusations in the book. Many buyers were inspired by curiosity to see if anyone they knew appeared on the list. Themes La France juive developed three strands of antisemitism. One was racial, proposing an opposition between non-Jewish ‚ÄùAryans‚Äù and Jewish ‚ÄùSemites‚Äù. Another was financial. The author argued that finance and capitalism were controlled by the Jews, even though some notable Jews, like Nissim de Camondo some 30 years later, shared their heritage with Parisian museums. A third was religious, referring to the Jews supposed complicity in the death of Jesus. Context The book appeared in France during a period of turmoil that followed the country's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. The years after the war saw a religious crisis, as the Third Republic followed a policy of secularisation. The emergence of economic liberalism during this period led to malaise and social tension. The crash of the Catholic Union General bank occurred in 1882, and Drumont blamed the disaster on the Rothschild family.

In her book, Moss advances a thesis that: - # The traditional idea of the \\"Age of Martyrdom\\", when Christians suffered persecution from the Roman authorities and lived in fear of being thrown to the lions, is largely fictional. # There was never sustained, targeted persecution of Christians by Imperial Roman authorities. # Official persecution of Christians by order of the Roman Emperor lasted for at most twelve years of the first three hundred of the Church's history.Moss 2013, p. 159. # Most of the stories of individual martyrs are pure invention, # Even the oldest and most historically accurate stories of martyrs and their sufferings have been altered and re-written by later editors, so that it is impossible to know for sure what any of the martyrs actually thought, did or said.  Contents   Martyrdom before Christianity  The book explains the origin of the Greek word \\"martyr\\" and how it came to be used by Christians as signifying someone who had witnessed for Christ with their life. Moss states that the Christian tradition held that martyrdom did not exist in previous eras. She goes on to argue that there were examples of martyrs among earlier Jews, Greeks and Romans, they were just not called by that term. Citing the deaths of Socrates and the aged Jewish teacher Eleazar, Moss maintains that they heavily influenced Christian martyrdom narratives, to the extent that \\"Christians adapted their ideas about martyrdom and sometimes even the stories themselves\\" (italics in original) \\"from both ancient Jewish and pagan writers.\\"  Historicity  It is a central thesis of the book that the ancient writings on martyrs and martyrdom are not reliable accounts of the events described. Moss characterizes most of the extant sources, such as the Acts of the Martyrs, as \\"elaborate, ornate, entertaining, and far from the truth\\". Moss also finds similarities between the events related and those of ancient Greek romance novels. In her book, Moss examined the oldest and generally agreed to be most authentic of the martyrdom accounts: the Martyrdom of Polycarp, the Acts of Ptolemaeus and Lucius, the account of the trial and death of Justin Martyr and companions, the Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs, the story of Perpetua and Felicity, and the Persecution in Lyon involving the bishop Pothinus, Blandina and several others. She claims that one cannot rely on these primary sources as accurate historical accounts because they have been altered and re-written by subsequent generations of Christians. = Examination of primary sources = In her examination of the \\"Martyrdom of Polycarp\\", Moss claims that it contains \\"many wild coincidences, improbabilities and illegalities\\". While not denying that Polycarp really suffered martyrdom, she observes that it is \\"impossible for us to imagine that the Martyrdom of Polycarp is a historical account of the events as they actually happened\\". Moss examines the tortures and deaths of Saints Pothinus, Blandina, and others in Church History by Eusebius of Caesarea. While the events occurred in Gaul about 177, the author notes that they originate from a partial version that may have been written about two hundred years after the events. In the text, Moss notes inconsistencies between the quoted cities and provinces of the Empire. Moss claims that various theological terms used were not otherwise attested before the third century. Moss notes that the letter begins by saying that the events are \\"worthy of undying remembrance\\" and she observes that the phrase was also used by Eusebius in both the Church History and his Martyrs of Palestine. According to Moss, these indicate that the letter was edited by Eusebius and that it is therefore impossible to tell which parts of it are historical and which parts were added by Eusebius for theological purposes.  Duration  According to Moss, although provincial governors in the Roman Empire had a great deal of personal discretion and power to do what they felt was needed in their jurisdiction, and there were local and sporadic incidents of persecution and mob violence against Christians, for most of the first three hundred years of Christian history Christians were able to live in peace, practice professions, and rise to positions of responsibility. \\"We are talking about fewer than ten years out of nearly three hundred during which Christians were executed as the result of imperial initiatives.\\"  Reasons for persecution  Moss holds that the Romans interpreted refusal to burn incense and make sacrificial offerings to an image of the Emperor as seditious and a sign of possible treason. They were not concerned with religious doctrine, but political rebellion.  Rewards for martyrs  Moss describes Church teachings that, once dead, all would wait for the Day of Judgement to decide one's eternal fate - all except for martyrs, who were awarded a martyr's crown and immediately went to heaven. For this reason some Christians deliberately sought martyrdom in a suicidal quest for a martyr's crown.  Conclusions  It is the author's contention that there are consequences of the promotion of such a \\"myth\\" that reach to the present day. While accepting that there were genuine cases of martyrdom and state persecutions of Christians, the author goes on to claim that the idea of a persecuted church was greatly exaggerated, especially by early church historian Eusebius. The author concludes that the idea that Christians have always been persecuted by the powers of evil, and always will be, has led to a combative and aggressive attitude by Christians even today. This is evidenced, according to Moss, in debates over such issues as abortion and same-sex marriage.  Reception  Laura Miller, writing for Salon, reviewed The Myth of Persecution. She said that \\"Moss cannot be called a natural or fluent writer, but she is thorough, strives for clarity and is genuinely fired up in her concern for the influence of the myth of martyrdom on Western societies.\\" In The National Catholic Reporter, Maureen Daly said \\"In the first few pages of The Myth of Persecution, I had the feeling that I had fallen into an argument already at full boil...Moss, scholar of the early church and martyrs, contends persecution was rare and the duration brief. Why is this important? 'The myth of Christian martyrdom is not only inaccurate; it has contributed to great violence and continues to support a view of the world in which we are under attack from our fellow human beings,' she writes.\\" Ephraim Radner, a historical theologian, reviewed the book in First Things. He wrote that \\"according to Moss's criteria... The rule is apparently to read skeptically the writings of the past, but not to doubt the imaginations of present-day scholars. The whole book, however, begs for the latter suspicion. Her framing chapters on the dishonesty and dangers of 'persecution' claims by contemporary conservative political voices and religious leaders easily identify her bias.\\" Kirkus Reviews said \\"The myth of martyrdom‚Äîand the expectation of huge rewards in heaven‚Äîwas effective in organizing a cohesive early Christian identity, which involved the notion of being 'under attack' and justified a violent reaction. While none of Moss' arguments are particularly new or striking, she provides an intriguing venture that begs for more research and focus.\\" In his review, N. Clayton Croy said: \\"Modern ideology drives Moss's thesis more than ancient testimony, and the result is a distortion of history more severe than the caricature she wants to expose.\\"https://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/9158_10095.pdf  Reviews     References  Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:Persecution of early Christians Category:Books about ancient Christianity Category:Ante-Nicene Christian martyrs ","title":"The Myth of Persecution"},{"id":"39057680","text":"Syringa pubescens is a species of flowering plant in the lilac genus of the family Oleaceae, native to Korea and China (Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan).Flora of China, v 15 p 283, Syringa pubescens Growing to tall and broad, it is a substantial deciduous shrub with green leaves felted white beneath, and panicles of heavily scented, white-throated lilac flowers in early summer.Turczaninow, Nicolai Stepanowitsch. 1840.
