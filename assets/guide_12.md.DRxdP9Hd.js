Tomb of Reginald's maternal grandparents, Anne Talbot (died 1494) and Henry Vernon (died 1515) in St Bartholomew's church, Tong, Shropshire. Reginald Corbet was the third son of Sir Robert Corbet (c. 1477‚Äì1513) of Moreton Corbet Castle in Shropshire, the Corbet family being landed gentry of Anglo-Norman descent, living in the Shropshire Welsh Marches for centuries, many of whom had represented Shropshire in Parliament, and Elizabeth Vernon (died 29 March 1563), daughter of Sir Henry Vernon of Haddon Hall and Tong, and Anne Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, Second Earl of Shrewsbury. Elizabeth had close ties with powerful families. Her father had been treasurer to Arthur Tudor, the Prince of Wales. The Talbots had vast estates in western and northern England. Reginald had two brothers: Roger Corbet (c. 1501‚Äì1538), the heir to Sir Robert's estates, and Richard Corbet (died 1566). Both were to be MPs. However, of the three brothers, only Roger was provided for when Sir Robert died on 11 April 1513: aged about 12, he was to undergo a long wardship before coming into full possession of the Corbet estates in 1522.S.

The will dates from 1509, making it likely that the two younger sons were born after that date, so Reginald was probably little more than an infant when his father died. Both younger sons would have to look elsewhere for advancement. For Richard this meant, initially, the court,S. T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì CORBET, Richard (Author: Alan Harding), accessed August 2013. while for Reginald it was the law. Legal career Reginald was educated at the Middle Temple and called to the bar, although the dates of his early career are not known. He was to be Lent Reader in 1552, by which time he was a distinguished lawyer. He was auditor at the Middle Temple in 1556, assistant to the reader in 1559. It is likely that Corbett was still at his Inn of Court when he served as MP for Wenlock in 1542. Only from about 1543 do the main outlines of his progress become clear. In 1543 Corbet served as Feodary for Shropshire, an official of the Court of Wards and Liveries. In 1546 he married Alice Gratewood (died 1603), the daughter of John Gratewood (d. 8 August 1570) of Wollerton, Shropshire, and Jane Hill. Alice was a niece of Sir Rowland HillCorbet, Augusta Elizabeth Brickdale: The family of Corbet; its life and times, Volume 2, pp. 267‚Äì269 at Open Library, Internet Archive, accessed July 2013. of London and Hodnet, an official of the Worshipful Company of Mercers who had made immense wealth from the trade with the Netherlands.S. T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509-1558 ‚Äì HILL, Sir Rowland (Author: Helen Miller), accessed August 2013. Hill was the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London. Marriage was immediately followed by a welter of appointments that can only be explained by Corbet's greatly improved connections. Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich, Lord Chancellor 1547-52. The former Shrewsbury School building, now the town's library. The year after his marriage, Corbet was made Recorder of Shrewsbury, an office he was to hold until 1559. That same year he was also made a justice of the peace for Shropshire and commissioner for chantries in the county, an important post in a year when chantries and colleges were being wound up by the new Protestant regime of Edward VI. In 1548, he was paid ten shillings \\"for a supplication exhibited to the Lord Chancellor to obtain a free school.\\" Significantly there was also a receipt for 20 pence to bribe the lord chancellor's servant to win his ear. Augusta Corbet, the family historian, claims Corbet and a group of friends had originated the scheme some years earlier in the reign of Henry VIII, hoping to use proceeds from the dissolution of Shrewsbury Abbey. This time the agitation was to prove ultimately successful and Shrewsbury School was opened in 1552, initially as a distinctly Calvinist institution. Honorific and lucrative appointments continued through Corbet's life, initially in Shropshire, then in other counties in the Marches and Wales, irrespective of the religious complexion of the regime. He was commissioner for relief in Shropshire in 1550. Under Queen Mary's Catholic regime, he was appointed to the Quarter Sessions of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Cheshire, Monmouthshire, and the Welsh counties. In 1553, he was made a member of the powerful Council of Wales and the Marches, together with his nephew, Sir Andrew Corbet. Toward the end of Mary's reign, on 6 April 1558, Corbet was made a justice of the Court of Great Sessions in Wales for the Northern Circuit, which consisted of Anglesey, Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire. In her final months, Mary approved Corbet's call as serjeant- at-law, although the appointment was not confirmed until April 1559, when Elizabeth's Protestant regime was firmly in control. The following October, Elizabeth made him a justice of the king's bench, necessitating resignation from the recordership at Shrewsbury, which he completed on 27 December. His work as a justice was distinguished, with colleagues commending his summings up, but not prolonged, as he died in 1566. Member of parliament Corbet was elected MP for Much Wenlock for the parliament of 1542, apparently while he was still resident at the Middle Temple. The electoral return was in Latin,S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509-1558 ‚Äì Much Wenlock (Author: N. M. Fuidge), accessed August 2013 and he was listed second in order of precedence to the other member, William Blount, uncle of Henry VIII's illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset.S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì BLOUNT, William (Author: Alan Harding), accessed August 2013 The breadth of Much Wenlock's franchise is obscure, but local gentry interests, like the Blounts, Corbets and Lacons, seem to have played a large part in the election, and the Diocese of Lichfield had also tried to exercise influence. In these circumstances, it is unlikely Corbet encountered great difficulty in securing election, although he did not sit in the parliament of 1545. In 1547 Corbet was sent to parliament by the Borough of Shrewsbury, which had just appointed him as recorder. Shrewsbury was an ancient royal borough and its MPs were frequently men who occupied some other civic office. However, Corbet was the first recorder of the borough elected to the House of Commons.S. T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509-1558 - Shrewsbury (Author: N. M. Fuidge), accessed August 2013. Corbet was returned as first member, together with John Evans, a staunch Catholic from Wales, who had been appointed clerk to the borough in the previous year.S. T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì EVANS (IEUANS, JEVANS), John (author: P. S. Edwards), accessed August 2013. The parliament was long-lived by Tudor standards, lasting until April 1552. Nothing is known about Corbet's part in it, except that he successfully requested leave of absence in its last month to serve as Lent reader at the Middle Temple. Corbet was not returned to the parliament of March 1553, the second and last of Edward VI's reign. The reasons are unknown. John Dudley, First Duke of Northumberland was the power in the land and he was particularly zealous in securing the return of his supporters to that parliament, although it is unclear why he would want to block the election of Corbet, who seems to have been broadly sympathetic to the Protestant faction. It is possibly relevant that Corbet's pay was lower than the former incumbent, so he may have been conducting a campaign of his own. On his return to parliament in October 1553, the first parliament of Mary's reign, the borough resolved that he should be an MP: \\"at this time and at all times hereafter so long as he is recorder... if he will take it upon him, for that it is supposed to be incident to his... office of recordership\\". It is unclear whether Corbet himself instigated this motion and it was certainly untrue that Shrewsbury recorders had previously sat as MPs ex officio. However, some boroughs did have such a tradition. Among Corbet's contemporaries, fellow Salopian Robert Broke was recorder and MP for London,S. T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509-1558 - BROKE, Robert (Author: Helen Miller) where the practice seems to have originated, while Richard Morgan occupied both offices for Gloucester,S.

Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Surveys 1509-1558 - Appendix XI: \\"They which stood for the true religion\\" October 1553 (author: S. T. Bindoff) these were the decided Protestants who resisted Mary's restoration of Catholicism from the outset. However, when returned to the parliament of 1555, he joined the cautious opposition to the regime, voting with his nephew, Sir Andrew, against an important government bill. Marriage and family Reginald Corbet married Alice Gratewood, daughter of John Gratewood of Wollerton, at Hodnet on 23 August 1546. Her uncle, Sir Rowland Hill, the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London, died without issue in 1561. He had used some of his immense wealth to buy estates in his native Shropshire and the neighbouring counties, most of them on the market because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. These he left to his two nieces. Alice inherited large estates that made herself and Reginald Corbet wealthy and secure for the latter part of their lives. On Alice's death, the estates were listed as the manors of Drayton, Adderley, Stoke on Tern, Hales, Almington and Blore, the village of Child's Ercall and granges at Cliffe, Tern Hill, Burnhill and Cheethill. Corbet and Alice had six sons and five daughters.Will of Reginald Corbet, dated 5 October 1566 and proved 22 January 1567 from the National Archives, PROB 11/49, available at The Oxford Authorship Site, accessed August 2013. :*Andrew predeceased his father. :*Robert predeceased his father. :*Rowland died while at school in Drayton. :*Francis predeceased his father. :*Richard (died c. 1601), Reginald Corbet's heir, married Anne Bromley, daughter of Lord Chancellor Thomas Bromley ::*Their son, Sir John Corbet, 1st Baronet, of Stoke upon Tern was a prominent opponent of Charles I's absolutist policies in the 1620s and sided with Parliament in the English Civil War. :*Peter married Elizabeth Pigott, daughter of Thomas Pigott of Chetwynd. :*Elizabeth married Robert Arden of Park Hall, Castle Bromwich. :*Mary married Francis Newton of Heightley. :*Anne married first Edward Mytton of Halston, then Sir William Leighton of Plaish. :*Margaret married Sir Humphrey Lee of Langley and Coton, near Alveley. :*Jane Death Augusta Corbett gives Reginald's year of death as 1569, but the date of probate makes this impossible and 19 November 1566, is now the accepted date, only about four months after the death of his brother, Richard. He had made his will the previous year and it was proved on 22 January 1567. Richard was his heir. However, as Reginald owed his good fortune mainly to his wife's inheritance, he recognised in his will and testament: :\\"And as concerning any devise to be made of my lands, I can make none, for my wife is joint-purchaser with me, and so that I remit wholly to her and to her provision for our children after such plat and devise as I have drawn, and remaineth in my coffer.\\" He gave a gelding to Sir Andrew and another gelding, together with his crossbow and a parcel-gilt silver cup, to Robert Corbet (died 1583), Sir Andrew's son, and asked them both to be good to Alice. He gave a gelding also to his brother-in-law, William Gratewood, forgiving him a debt of ¬£14. He left the very large sum of ¬£400 for the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth, then still single. He was generous to his servants, giving each a full year's pay and up to an extra year's free board and lodging while they looked for employment. Alice was made the sole executrix.

Contant, aka George Contant Sontag (April 10, 1864 - date of death unknown), was an outlaw of the American West known mostly for train robberies. Like his older brother, John Sontag, he was originally from Mankato, Minnesota. Background Contant was the younger of two sons of Jacob Contant and the former Maria Bohn. After the death of their father in 1867, John Sontag took the surname of his stepfather, Matthias Sontag, his mother's second husband, a veteran of the Union Army during the American Civil War. George Contant however kept the original name though the two were usually called The Sontag Brothers. The two were frequent partners in crime. After he stole cigars from an employer, George Contant was sent to reform school in St. Paul, Minnesota. After a subsequent conviction for theft, Contant was imprisoned at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln. There is a marriage record of George Contant married to Therese Landgraff (1865-1898) on October 11, 1887 in La Crosse, Wisconsin; they had at least one child George Contant (1887-1896).LDs family search Crime and punishment With his brother imprisoned in Nebraska, John Sontag came to Fresno, California, and began working for the Southern Pacific Transportation Company. After an industrial accident, he was employed near Visalia, California, by a farmer and livery stable operator, who soon became his partner in crime, Christopher \\"Chris\\" Evans. After Contant was released from prison in Lincoln, he joined his brother and Chris Evans on a trip to Minnesota, where on July 1, 1892, they attempted to rob a train while riding along the Minnesota River between St. Peter and Kasota. They acquired nothing of much value, but their crime aroused the concern of Pinkerton detectives. A month later, back in California, the trio robbed a train at Collis, now Kerman in Fresno County. This time, they acquired $500 and bags of Mexican and Peruvian coins of no apparent value. Several days after the robbery, law-enforcement officers arrested Contant in connection with the crime, but Sontag and Evans fled as fugitives. A nationally-publicized manhunt culminated in what is known as the Battle of Stone Corral. Found guilty of train robbery at Collis in October 1892, Contant was incarcerated for fifteen years at Folsom State Prison. The following June 1893, John Sontag died shortly after his 32nd birthday either of gunshot wounds sustained at the Battle of Stone Corral and/or tetanus while in custody in Fresno and is interred at Calvary Cemetery in Fresno. Chris Evans lost an eye and his left arm preceding his surrender. He too was sent to Folsom, where he remained for seventeen years . Evans was paroled in 1911 and died in 1917.

She started her career in the early 2000s touring as a bassist for her father Otis Taylor, a trance blues musician. She released a positively received solo album, Out Of My Mind, in 2013, which infused traditional Delta blues with genres as diverse as electronica, indie rock, and psychedelia. Based in Kansas City, Missouri as of 2013, she is also a model and fashion designer. Early life, career Cassie Taylor was born in 1986 in Boulder, Colorado, where she was raised by her parents Carol Ellen Bjork and blues musician Otis Taylor. She has one younger sister. Despite being born during a period when her father was on hiatus from the music industry, he did expose her to blues music and teach her piano when she was young. She only became aware of his previous career around age 8 or 9. At around age 12 she began playing electric bass, impressing her father with a rendition of \\"Hey Joe.\\" When Taylor was 16 her father asked her to tour as the bassist in his band. Since his usual bassist Kenny Passarelli had a conflicting schedule she joined his summer tour, playing for twenty dollars per gig. According to Taylor, her father didn't build her up as a prodigy, but rather \\"I think I was just cheap child labor. Plus, he knew I wasn‚Äôt going to get drunk on the road or go missing. Some people have the fear of God in them. I had the fear of Otis.\\" She toured multiple countries with the band, picking up vocals and keyboards as well. She went on to appear in eight of his albums, including lending bass and vocals to his 2007 album Definition of a Circle. She is also on the Board of Directors for the Blues Foundation. Fashion, modeling By 2009, Taylor quit the band to work on her own demo recordings. Frustrated with the process, she moved to Memphis with her boyfriend and stepped back from music. She began working in retail, started studying fashion design, and began a modeling career. She later started her own company, Moorhead Apparel, with a focus on men's clothing. She has made appearances in a number of studio and student films. Later music career She rededicated herself to music in 2010, beginning to work on her debut solo album, Blue, where she wrote all the tracks. Released in 2011, The New Yorker called it a \\"solid collection of original songs, with occasional nods to her father's trance blues.\\" During this time she formed the trio Girls With Guitars with musicians Dani Wilde and Samantha Fish. They released an eponymous album in 2011, afterwards beginning to tour. While she mostly writes her own material, Taylor has also reworked songs by artists as diverse as Nine Inch Nails and Muddy Waters. Out Of My Mind (2013) By 2012 she had moved to Kansas City, Missouri and started mixing tracks for her sophomore album. Originally financed through the proceeds of her husband selling his car, she was signed by Yellow Dog Records during the production process. Most of the recording took place at Immersive Studios in Boulder, where she had previously worked. Taylor wrote, arranged, produced, and sang all tracks, also providing bass guitar, piano, Hammond organ, and theremin. The band she formed for the album and live performances includes Larry Thompson on drums and Steve Mignano on guitar, as well as Jon Gray on trumpet. The 12-track album, Out Of My Mind, was released on May 7, 2013. =Music video= A music video for the first track, \\"That's My Man,\\" was shot in Memphis early in 2013. About the video, which she dedicated to friends in the modeling industry who were LGBTQ, \\"In the video there are four different 'males.' There are the muscle cars, which represent the personification of the traditional male, a man, a transgendered (female to male), and a drag queen. All of them represent different forms of male, whether it be mental, physical or spiritual.‚Äù =Reception= Reviews were positive, earning sound comparisons to Diana Ross and the Supremes, Janis Joplin, and Gladys Knight, with one review calling the album a \\"mesmerizing, nuanced, and imaginatively arranged collection of blues-inflected originals.\\" Also, \\"Her writing is both intelligent and moving, with exceptionally strong melodies and challenging rhythms, and her production is vivid and adventuresome.\\" \\"Taylor‚Äôs original compositions here all have to do with heartbreak, but she expresses her pain so exquisitely that it‚Äôs a pleasure for the listener to bear.\\" About her vocals, Premier Guitar wrote \\"Taylor floats through her melodies with a relaxed, sassy vibe and none of the melismatic tinsel that plagues many contemporary female singers.\\" Style Out Of My Mind merges traditional Delta blues with electronica, indie rock, psychedelia, and other modern genres. According to Taylor, \\"I use a lot of different influences ...from West African psychedelic rock, to classic rock, to industrial metal.\\" About combining genres, ‚ÄúFor me, the blues is the root of all American music, and I love each individual genre of American music. It would be dishonest to not use all of the things that I‚Äôve been exposed to because I love them so much.‚Äù Personal life Taylor married Chuck Haren in late 2012.

Malenka (born June 21, 1955) is a Nancy Friend Pritzker Professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. He is also the director of the Nancy Friend Pritzker Laboratory in the Stanford Medical Center. He is a member of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, as well as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Malenka's laboratory research with the National Alzheimer's Foundation has informed researchers aiming to find a neuronal basis for Alzheimer's disease. Malenka's main career is focused on studying the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the effects of neural circuits on learning and memory.  Early years and education  Robert Malenka grew up playing sports in the town of Belmont, Massachusetts. Malenka is still an avid tennis player and athletic spectator. He grew up with his brother, David Malenka, who is currently practicing cardiology at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, New Hampshire. Malenka always had an interest in science, and while choosing a career path also considered being a neurosurgeon, neurologist, and clinical psychologist. For Malenka's undergraduate education, he attended Harvard University and graduated in 1978. After his graduation, Malenka received his MD and PhD from Stanford University in 1983. While receiving these titles, he also completed his psychiatric residency at Stanford and a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco.  Career  Malenka has spent the last ten years in his lab identifying the mechanically distinct forms of synaptic plasticity present in the human brain. His main goal was to distinctly separate the steps which lead to the varying forms of synaptic plasticity, while also identifying the proteins which contribute to the altering of synaptic efficacy over time. As a side project in his laboratory, Malenka studies the effects that drugs like cocaine and amphetamine have on synaptic plasticity. In recent years, he has isolated a novel form of synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens, the part of the brain associated with reward pathways.  Professional organizations  Spanning from 1999 to 2008, Malenka served on the Society for Neuroscience's Programming Committee, the Renovis Incorporated Advisory Board, and the Merck Incorporated Advisory Board. He is currently on the Scientific Council for the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, and is on the Board of Directors for the Brain Research Foundation. Malenka is also the co-founder of Circuit Therapeutics, Inc, a company which he began working with in 2012. Circuit Therapeutics uses optogenetic technology to target specific neurons in patients who suffer from chronic diseases and have damaged neuronal function.  Publications  Malenka's work has been published in 274 papers. One of his first major publications was in Neuron Magazine's inaugural issue, a paper in which he proposed that long-term potentiation at neuronal synapses must involve some postsynaptic modifications.  Awards and honors  Robert Malenka's first major career award was the Young Investigator Award, given to him by the Society for Neuroscience in 1993. After graduation from Stanford Medical School, Malenka earned the Distinguished Alumni Award in 1998. In that same year, Malenka earned the Daniel Efron Award, given to him by the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. Malenka's first international award came in 2000, when he received the International Prize in Neuroscience from the Milena Kemali Foundation. Malenka is a two-time recipient of the Julius Axelrod Prize, one given as a mentorship award from the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (2011), and the other given to him by the Society for Neuroscience in 2016.

It was described by Boheman in 1848. Abacetus pumilus is a small, but distinctive, beetle with red legs and antennae, and a green tinge on its wings. Very little is known about Abacetus pumilus habitat, however it is found throughout the arid deserts and semi-arid steppes of southern Africa. Taxonomy and Phylogeny The species name pumilus is from Latin meaning dwarf, referencing the beetles small size. Abacetus pumilus is closely related to Abacetus pygmaeus. =Species key= Following the species key developed by L. Peringuey Abacetus pumilus can be identified by: GROUP. The prothorax is strongly heart shaped and the frontal groove (sulci) is deep and curved like a bow. :Sub-group. Species have a metallic sheen on the upper-side. ::Abacus pumilus. The upper surface of the prothorax (pronotum) is broader than long. Description =Size= L. Peringuey described the adult beetles as 6mm in length and 2mm in width. =Colour and Markings= The head and prothorax of the beetle are black, wings (elytra) have a dark green tinge, legs and the three basal joints of the antennae are red. =Thorax= The prothorax rounded on the side, moderately widened in the middle and suddenly narrowed (but not truncated) at a very short distance from the base. Rear angle sharp and projecting, deeply marked (punctured) at base. =Wings= Wings (elytra) are not broader than the prothorax, however are elongated and a little depressed, marked with fine parallel lines which are very finely scratched (aciculate). Intervals between the parallel lines are smooth. Distribution and Habitat Abacetus pumilus has been mainly collected from Namibia with a single collection from near Kwekwe in Zimbabwe. There have also been references to Abacetus pumilus being found in Southern Angola and from the Transkei province in South Africa. However no specific location details are available. Based on the collection records, Abacetus pumilus is predominately found in both hot and cold arid deserts (BWh, BWk), and hot and cold arid steppes (BSh, BSk).

Jack arrives at night with a white flower to give to Wendy and asks for a dinner date together that night, however Wendy refuses by claiming to be too tired. After Jack left Wendy went back to her living room and set the white flower in a vase down on her living room table and poured a glass of wine and started flipping through channels on the television until one channel showed her in her own living room. In surprise and fear she knocks over her glass of wine spilling it on the floor and goes to try and find the source of the camera. She notices upon closer examination things do not match up correctly and starts flipping the channel and starts to see an alternate version of Jack giving the flower and her accepting the dinner date of making spaghetti and then making love. She continues to watch as the T.V. continues to show the future of what would have happened such as Jack and Wendy falls in love with each other, their engagement party, moving to a new house, two babies, later one who has grown up and snuck back into the house stubbing her knee against the living room floor waking up an older Wendy who confronts the daughter in a supportive way, a scene of Jack and Wendy as an elderly couple with Jack bringing Wendy another white flower to symbolize their love through the decades, and finally the T.V. channel turns into static.

The pleats of the suthan either gather in circles resembling bangles, or fall vertically to the ankles. As the distinction between the loose Punjabi suthan and the baggy salwar rests on the ankle band, some view the loose Punjabi suthan as another version of the salwar,Singh, Daljit (2004) Punjab Socio-Economic Condition (1501-1700 A.D.) with the definition of suthan being reserved for the tight Punjabi suthan.

Henry (1872) Hand-book of the Manufactures and Arts of the Punjab which would then be covered with a Punjabi Ghagra when going outdoors. The Punjabi ghagra has its origins in the candataka which continued as a popular female dress in the seventh century.Uma Prasad Thapliyal (1978) Foreign elements in ancient Indian society, 2nd century BC to 7th century AD The use of the svasthana was also popular in this period. However, the candataka ended at the thighs and the svasthana may have been used to cover the lower legs thus giving rise to the tradition of wearing the ghagra and the suthan together. Older Punjabi women wore churidar pajamma and long kurta. These different styles were popular during the 1960s in East Punjab.Mohinder Singh Randhawa. (1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala. Certain members of the Punjabi community however, were wearing the suthan and kurti on its own without the Punjabi Ghagra, a tradition documented in the Gazetter of Hoshiarpur District 1883-84Gazetteer of the Hoshiarpur District: 1883-84. Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2001. and also in the 1915 Hissar Gazetteerhttp://revenueharyana.gov.in/html/gazeteers/hissar%201915.pdf Punjabi women (and men) also wore the ghutanna, a type of pajamma which was shorter than the full length pajamma, and was tight and ended at the calf.Paintings and lifestyles of Jammu Region: 17th to 19th Century A.D Raj Kumar Although the use of the Suthan subsequently spread to the Jammu area of the Punjab region, SindhS. P. ChablƒÅnƒ´ Economic conditions in Sind, 1592 to 1843 (1951) (where it was not traditionally worn) and Kashmir, in the plains of the Punjab region, the suthan was replaced with the Punjabi version of the salwar and the Punjabi kameez which gained more and more popularity during the 1960s. Punjabi suthan suit revival In recent years, the Punjabi suthan suit has been revived. However, the pleats fall in a variet of ways and the ankle band is not as tight as the traditional Punjabi suthan. =Punjabi salwar suit= Punjabi salwar In its strictest sense, the salwar is baggy and loose straight down the legs, and gathered loosely at the ankles. During the medieval period, people adopted the Iraqi style of salwar in Multan and neighbouring Sindh.Kumar, Raj (2008) Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern Said,Hakim Mohammad (1990) Road to Pakistan. 1. 712 - 1858 This type of salwar is traditionally very baggy and gathered at the ankles. It is still worn by the Kurdish community in Iraq. The presence of the baggy salwar was noted by Alberuni in the 11th century A.D. and continued to be envogue between the 16th and 18th centuries C.E. in MultanDasti, Humaira Faiz (1998) Multan, a province of the Mughal Empire, 1525-1751 The Multani salwar is similar to the loose Punjabi suthan. Therefore, the distinction between the loose Punjabi suthan and the loose Multani salwar is fine and centres on the tight ankle band in the suthan, and on the suthan beginning to fit closer to the legs below the knees. The original Punjabi loose salwar was not as baggy as the Multani style but was wide, with the gathering at the ankles being wide enough to cover the feet. Originally, up to ten yards of cloth was used to make Punjabi salwars.Yarwood, Doreen (2011) Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Costume The original Punjabi salwar was also not as baggy as other forms of the salwar, such as the type worn in Afghanistan (partug)), the Balochi salwar,Punjab district gazetteers, Volume 7, Part 1 (1923) or the loose Punjabi suthan, and gathers more quickly below the knees and ends in a tight band. Eventually the modern Punjabi salwar came into being which is slim fitting and does not have wide ends as before. Another style of salwar is the Pothohari salwar of the Pothohar area of the Punjab region. The Pothohari salwar retains the wideness of the Punjabi suthan. The kameez is also wide. The chunni is a remnant of the large chadar popular in West Punjab known as salariKehal, Harkesh Singh (2011) Alop ho riha Punjabi virsa Lokgeet Parkashan and the large Phulkari worn in various areas of the Punjab region. However, the Pothohari salwar suit did not attain universal acceptance. The Bahawalpuri salwar is also wide and baggyCurrent Opinion, Volume 25 (1899) with many folds. The material traditionally used for the Bahawalpuri shalwar and suthan is known as Sufi which is a mixture of cotton warp mixed with silk weft and gold threads running down the material.Extracts from the District & States Gazetteers of the Punjab, Pakistan, Volume 2 (1976) The Pakistan gazetteer, Volume 5 (2000) File:Nawab Muhammad Of Bawalpur 1868-1900.JPGNawab Muhammad Of Bahawalpur (1868-1900) wearing a loose Bahawalpuri salwar File:Prince Suba Sadiq Abbasi.JPGPrince Suba Sadiq Abbasi, Bahawalpur Punjabi kameez The Punjabi kameez is also cut straight with side slits.Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Volume 138 (1961) This combination makes up the Punjab salwar suit outfit,Alop Ho Reha Punjabi Virsa Harkesh Singh Kehal which is very popular,The Hindu: article RAMACHANDRA GUHA and was developed in the Punjab region.Bhushan, Jamila Brij (1958) The Costumes and Textiles of India The Punjabi ghagra is now rarely worn.

The salwar is similar to pajamas or pants, wide at the top and tightened loosely around the ankles with hard material, called paunchay.

The term salwar kameez also includes the Kashmiri Phiran/suthan outfit. In the Punjab region, the salwar was made using a large amount of material but had no pleats or folds.

He joined the Marines in 1940 as an enlisted man and at the start of WWII was selected for officer training. He was assigned as a weapons platoon commander in the First Marine Division. He served in WWII, Korea and Vietnam. In Vietnam as the commander of the First Marine Regiment he conducted the relief operation of the Khe Sanh Combat Base and was in command during the heaviest fighting at the Battle of Hue. He was the only Marine to have been awarded the Navy Cross in both WWII and Vietnam. Award citations =Navy Cross= The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to First Lieutenant Stanley Smith Hughes (MCSN: 0-12654), United States Marine Corps Reserve, for extraordinary heroism as Commanding Officer of a machine gun platoon attached to a company of the Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces at Cape Gloucester, New Britain, on 4 January 1944. When the advance of his company was stopped on the banks of a stream by a withering hail of enemy machine-gun fire from the opposite side which killed the leaders of both assault platoons and inflicted heavy casualties, First Lieutenant Hughes unhesitatingly exposed himself to the relentless hostile fire and, rallying the remnants of the platoons, courageously led them across the stream where they remained isolated in a precarious position. He then braved the enemy fire alone to re-cross the stream in an attempt to bring up reinforcements but, finding none available, rejoined his men, carrying them food. By his valiant leadership, First Lieutenant Hughes inspired his men to tremendous effort and enabled them to provide effective cover for other units subsequently making the hazardous crossing. His selfless courage and indomitable fighting spirit contributed materially to the complete destruction of the enemy defenses and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

During Operation HUE CITY, Colonel Hughes displaced his command post from Phu Bai to Hue along National Route One through enemy controlled territory. Undaunted by the heavy volume of hostile fire around him as he entered the besieged city, he rapidly moved his men along the fire-swept streets to reach the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Compound. Moving to a vantage point on a roof top, he directed accurate counter-mortar and sniper fire, effectively suppressing the hostile fire in the area. He then maneuvered two battalions in an aggressive assault against the enemy, repeatedly disregarding his own safety to move to the areas of heaviest fighting to advise his commanders, encourage his men and personally request and direct support arms fire. When the First Battalion, Fifth Marines was attached to his regiment during heavy fighting, he fearlessly crossed the footbridge over the Perfume River under heavy fire, joining the command group at the Citadel to brief the unit commanders of the tactical situation and remain abreast of the battalion's progress. He repeatedly traveled across dangerously exposed areas to ensure the availability and uninterrupted distribution of vital supply items and equipment to his units. By his bold initiative, intrepid fighting spirit and superior tactical skill, Colonel Hughes was instrumental in the defeat and annihilation of a numerically superior enemy force, thereby reflecting great credit upon himself and the Marine Corps and upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

After he landed in the assault and established a beachhead on the previous day against strong hostile opposition, Captain Hughes vigorously continued to push the attack until all remaining enemy forces in his zone of action were driven across a sand spit and onto a small peninsula upon which they prepared a last-ditch defense from heavily fortified positions. While directing the reduction of the hostile positions which commanded the sand spit, he frequently exposed himself to enemy fire and, although wounded in the shoulder, refused to be evacuated and continued to press the attack until all remaining Japanese in that zone of action were annihilated.

During this period, Colonel Hughes exhibited superior professionalism and dedication in the performance of his demanding duties. Initially serving as Division Inspector, he traveled extensively throughout the Division's Tactical Area of Responsibility to keep abreast of the combat readiness of units and the status of logistical supplies and training programs. With exceptional acuity, he resolved complex problems and assessed the effectiveness with which units performed their assigned missions. Responsible for administering Request Mast as the representative of the Commanding General, he utilized his vast professional experience in meeting the needs of the personnel within the command. He also offered advice and encouragement to less experienced officers who sought to improve their professional ability and develop their leadership potential. Reassigned on 21 January 1968 as Commanding Officer of the First Marines, Colonel Hughes assumed command while the reinforced regiment was engaged in Operation NEOSO II. Directed three days later to displace his regimental headquarters to Phu Bai, he displayed exceptional organization ability in effecting the move on 28 January without the loss of operational effectiveness. After successfully leading his units in three subsequent major operations in the Hue - Phu Bai area, Colonel Hughes moved his regiment into the heavily besieged Khe Sanh Combat Base. Utilizing his headquarters personnel and personnel from various tenant activities to man major portions of the defensive perimeter, he effectively deployed battalion combat elements to the surrounding hills where they continuously sought out the enemy, denying hostile forces the use of terrain used for the employment of mortars, rockets and artillery. Exhibiting a comprehensive knowledge of military tactics, Colonel Hughes fully exploited maximum use of supporting arms fire before launching well coordinated assaults. In addition, through his capable leadership and professionalism, he maintained the tactical integrity of his units by skillful maneuvering and employment of his forces prior to the decisive phase of battle. By his superb professional ability, decisive leadership and steadfast devotion to duty, Colonel Hughes rendered distinguished service to his country and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.

A nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months. The provincial judiciary launched an investigation into the cause of the explosion. Primary suspects were Litoral Gas (the natural-gas provider for Rosario) and an employee who carried out maintenance work at the building that day. Several public figures sent condolences, and most of the candidates for the 2013 primary elections suspended their political campaigns. The event Location map. The explosion occurred at 9:30 a.m. near the intersection of Oro√±o and Salta Streets in central Rosario. Initial reports confirmed eight people dead, sixty injured and fifteen missing; eight more deaths were later confirmed. Searches the following day revealed twelve fatalities, ten of whom were identified. Of the people who were missing, some were found dead among the debris, while others were rescued. The search for survivors ended on August 13, with twenty-two people confirmed dead. A 65-year-old woman who had been injured died on October 8. The explosion was caused by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse. M√≥nica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. The streets were covered with broken glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene. The natural gas supplier, Litoral Gas, immediately began sealing the distribution pipe to the area. The Center for Ambulatory Medical Specialties of Rosario () managed the information about the dead and injured, and tents were prepared for those left homeless. Firefighters and other workers found people trapped on the upper floors of buildings and evacuated them over adjacent roofs. Although the building was not destroyed by the explosion, a high risk of structural failure remained. Investigation Neighbors reported to the press that they had smelled a gas leak several hours before the explosion and had called Litoral Gas. Company director Jos√© Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez said that the company had received no such calls, and thought that callers might have dialed the 911 emergency number instead. Prosecutor Camporini reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion. The provincial judiciary launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the explosion. The prosecution conducted a search and seizure at the offices of Litoral Gas to confirm the absence of customer complaints about the gas leak. Judge Juan Carlos Curto ordered the arrest of Carlos Osvaldo Garc√≠a, an employee of the department responsible for gas service to the area. He was captured during the night, and his assistant Pablo Mi√±o surrendered to police the following day. According to witnesses, one employee fled in a van before the explosion, when he realized the severity of the gas leak, while another remained to try to evacuate people from the endangered area. The van belonged to Garc√≠a, who experienced an acute stress reaction during the trial. Curto checked the remnants of the gas employee's workshop to verify Garc√≠a's testimony. Prosecutor Graciela Arg√ºelles said that, according to the investigation, Litoral Gas ignored calls for help from Garc√≠a, who was not properly trained to manage such a situation. The judge suggested that documents seized from Litoral Gas might prove the existence of customer reports of a gas leak. Curto thought that the employees might not bear sole responsibility, and that the liability of Litoral Gas had to be investigated as well. Pablo Mi√±o was released from prison, but Curto refused to release Garc√≠a, saying that Mi√±o had extenuating circumstances which Garc√≠a did not. Mi√±o's job was to give Garc√≠a the required tools, not to do the maintenance. He was in the street, watching over the van, which was not properly parked and locked, and did not see Garc√≠a's work before the explosion. Curto stopped short of pronouncing Mi√±o innocent at that early stage. As the case expanded beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused himself from the trial and was replaced by Javier Beltramone, who released Garc√≠a from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2‚Äì1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. Garc√≠a had claimed that he was following instructions received in the days before the explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that Garc√≠a had not received any instructions prior to the explosion. Litoral Gas proposed an out-of-court settlement to the relatives of the victims, offering about 1200 US dollars per square meter of collapsed building, in addition to compensation for loss of life. Vice Governor Jorge Henn rejected it as immoral, and most of the families also initially rejected the proposal. By May 2014, however, almost half of the families had accepted the settlement. Reaction President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner at the site of the explosion The explosion occurred shortly before the primary 2013 Argentine legislative elections on August 11. The governor of Santa Fe province, Antonio Bonfatti, asked the political parties to end their campaigns to allow mourning for the victims of the explosion. The Front for Victory and Progressive, Civic and Social Front candidates suspended their campaigns, and the national government declared two days of mourning. The period of mourning was observed by all candidates in Buenos Aires and most other provinces, who ended their political campaigns. President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, who had recently returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited the site of the explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents; some were angry because her surprise visit halted work at the site, and others thought her presence was politically motivated. The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La C√°mpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay. Weeks before the explosion, several social networking sites had scheduled a country-wide cacerolazo (a pot-banging protest demonstration), known as 8A, against Kirchner for August 8. The websites had already conducted successful cacerolazos (8N and 18A). Despite the national mourning, the 8A protest went ahead as planned, with the added slogan \\"No more pointless deaths\\". Candidate Ricardo Gil Lavedra thought the cacerolazo should have been canceled, as the campaigning was, but fellow candidate Rodolfo Terragno supported it. It was attended by fewer people than previous ones in Buenos Aires and the rest of the country. The demonstration in Rosario was not a cacerolazo, but a silent candlelight vigil attended by nearly a hundred people. There was a second demonstration in Rosario on August 22, proceeding from the National Flag Memorial to the headquarters of Litoral Gas. Pope Francis sent a letter of condolence to Archbishop Jos√© Luis Mollaghan of Rosario, and it was read during a mass and procession for Saint Cajetan at Plaza 25 de Mayo. Newell's Old Boys and Rosario Central, two local soccer teams and rivals in the Rosario derby, organized a charity match for the victims at the Gabino Sosa Stadium, and Rosario-born Lionel Messi provided support through the \\"Leo Messi\\" charity. The charity match collected 120,000 pesos. Musicians Fito P√°ez, Vicentico, Babas√≥nicos, Las Pelotas, Chaque√±o Palavecino, Ciro Pertusi, Lisandro Aristimu√±o, Pablo Dacal and Coki de Bernardis performed concerts in several Argentine cities to raise money for the victims. Reconstruction Bonfatti announced that Santa Fe province would provide financial help to the victims of the explosion. Since most houses in the vicinity were damaged, affected families would receive a subsidy of $20,000 to rent homes during reconstruction. They would receive $50,000 in credit to buy furniture and appliances, payable in 60 months with five percent interest. Rosario's real estate firms prepared a list of houses for rent without charging victims their regular fee. Some of the affected buildings may have had cheap insurances which would not cover the risk of an explosion. Some cars trapped in an underground parking lot could not be retrieved. When the search for survivors ended, authorities closed Salta Street. Engineers began checking the buildings at ground zero, trying to restore the original layout of the street and demolishing unstable structures. Secretary of Public Works Omar Saab said that the two remaining buildings were beyond repair and had to be demolished. As a sign of respect, the demolition would not be carried out with explosives. Secretary of Housing Gustavo Leone estimated that the work would take nearly six months. People were allowed to enter their destroyed houses in small groups at a time, starting on August 9. Nearby streets began to be reopened on August 13. The CGT union signed a deal with the association of factories of Rosario and the government of Rosario to make sure that all the victims of the explosions would keep their jobs.

Dedicated on August 7, 1992, it was established as a tribute to the Americans and their allies who lost their lives during the Guadalcanal Campaign from 7 August 1942 to 9 February 1943. The capital city of Honiara is to its north. To mark the 50th anniversary of the Red Beach landings, the U.S. War Memorial was dedicated on 7 August 1992. An account of this is also inscribed on red marble tablets inside the monument compound. The memorial was a joint effort of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) and the Guadalcanal-Solomon Islands Memorial Commission, and was at the initiative of Robert F Reynolds, Chief of Valors Tours Ltd. The memorial is maintained by the ABMC. Every year on 7 August, a commemorative ceremony is held to mark the first day of the battle. Another monument, erected by the Japanese on Mount Austen, is a tribute to the Japanese who lost their lives. Background The US Navy, Marine Corps, Army and their allies fought the forces of the Empire of Japan at Guadalcanal during World War II from August 7, 1942 to February 9, 1943 to take control of the island where the Japanese had established a strong base. During the six-month period, bitter fighting took place on land, in the air, and at sea, until the Japanese voluntarily withdrew after several setbacks in the seven major naval battles and clashes in the air. The American forces were ultimately victorious. The Japanese evacuated the island from Cape Esperance on the north west coast in February 1943. The bitter struggle that took place in which both \\"slugged it out toe to toe\\", resulted in loss of 1200 aircraft, 49 ships and as many as 35,000 American and Japanese men. It was uncertain as to who would ultimately prevail. When the Japanese capitulated and withdrew, the Japanese Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi who was assigned the task of destroying the American Marines said \\"Guadalcanal is not the name of an island. It is the graveyard of the Japanese Army\\". The conflict turned the tide against Japan and it was a decisive battle of the Pacific War, won by the effective joint action of all arms and services of the United States, and in which the marines played a crucial part. Japanese losses were immense, including 800 aircraft and 2362 pilots and crew. The Americans lost 24 warships totaling 126,240 tons, but had the resources to recoup their losses, and American dead were one tenth of the total 50,000 deaths in the battle. It was in this battle that the legend of \\"the invincibility of the Japanese soldier and Zero fighter plane\\" were destroyed. In this longest campaign of the Pacific War, 65,000 American forces committed were from the US Marine Corps, US Ground Forces and US Navy construction units. The combined losses of all these forces amounted to: Killed including from injuries and missing were 1,342 of the Marine Corps and wounded were 3,170; US Navy lost 4,737 including missing at sea and 2,344 were wounded; US Army‚Äôs Americal Division lost 344 while 855 were wounded; US 25th Infantry division (late entrant into the battle) lost 216 with 439 wounded; USAAF Thirteenth Air force lost 93 while many were injured; US Navy lost 41 airmen and the Marine corps air arm lost many but their number has not been disclosed. Americans who were taken prisoner were never heard of again. Features The memorial is located on Skyway Drive on a hillock (the first hill that was occupied by the US forces) overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It is to the west of the Matanikau River, which was the battle front for many months between the Americans and the Japanese, with a commanding view of Mount Austen and Ironbottom Sound. In the shape of a pylon, the memorial is spread over a large area. The main memorial is in size and in height. The four fascia of the monument are oriented towards the four directions where the battles were fought. The details of the five battles and the names of ships (of the US and its Allies) that were lost during the operations are inscribed on marble plaques. The plaques give a brief description of the five battles fought ‚Äì Bloody Ridge (\\"Edson‚Äôs Ridge\\"), Tassafaronga at Ironbottom Sound, New Georgia Island (which was the Solomon Island campaign), Cape Esparance and Mount Austen. The memorial inscription reads: \\"This memorial has been erected by the United States of America in humble tribute to its sons and its allies who paid the ultimate sacrifice for the liberation of the Solomon Islands 1942-1943\\" References Bibliography    Category:Honiara Category:Guadalcanal Campaign Category:1992 establishments in the Solomon Islands Category:Monuments and memorials ","title":"Guadalcanal American Memorial"},{"id":"40182101","text":"Danny Lee Patrick (July 8, 1941 ‚Äì July 26, 2009) was an educator and farmer from rural Delaney in Madison County, Arkansas, who served from 1967 to 1970 as a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives for Madison and neighboring Carroll counties in the northwestern corner of his state. His legislative service coincided exactly with the administration of Winthrop Rockefeller, Arkansas' first GOP governor since Reconstruction. Like Rockefeller, Patrick was unseated in his bid for a third term in the general election held on November 3, 1970. The Democrats, led by gubernatorial nominee and, later, U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers, wiped out the gains that Republicans had temporarily achieved during the Rockefeller years. Political life Patrick was one of two sons born to Dan Ervin Patrick (1912‚Äì1971) and the former Audie M. Van Brunt (1916‚Äì1997)Social Security Death Index in the unincorporated community of Delaney near the county seat of Huntsville in Madison County. Orval Eugene Faubus, the governor from 1955 to 1967, was another Madison County native. Patrick was friendly with both Rockefeller and Faubus, who were opposing major party candidates in the gubernatorial general election held on November 3, 1964, at the same time that Republican U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona waged his unsuccessful challenge to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Patrick frequently attended meetings in the Arkansas State Capitol in Little Rock and at the wealthy Rockefeller's exclusive estate, WinRock Farms, in nearby Morrilton in Conway County. Though he developed a good relationship with Rockefeller, Patrick had known Faubus since Patrick was a young boy: \\"I loved him\\", he said of Faubus, who died in 1994, in a 2007 interview.Statement of Danny Lee Patrick, June 2007 In 1981, Patrick was among those who supported Republican Governor Frank D. White's decision to appoint Faubus to head the Arkansas Veterans Affairs Department. Numerous Moderate Republicans, who had formerly identified with Rockefeller, including Leona Troxell of White County, opposed the Faubus selection.Arkansas Gazette, August 5, 1981; Troxell, later Leona Troxell Dodd was defeated in her 1974 race for lieutenant governor by the Democrat Joe Purcell, who was the acting governor for six days in January 1979. To win his state House seat, Patrick defeated in both 1966 and 1968 the Democrat F. A. \\"Pat\\" Teague (1904‚Äì1975), a turkey farmer from Berryville in Carroll County in the newly formed District 2 for Madison and Carroll counties. The previous incumbent for Carroll County, Teague, who formerly called himself a \\"Faubus Republican\\", was sixty-two years old in the 1966 race against the 25-year-old Patrick. Before he switched to Democrat affiliation, Teague had been an Arkansas delegate to the 1952 Republican National Convention, which met in Chicago, Illinois, to nominate the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket. Arkansans, however, voted for the Stevenson-Sparkman slate of presidential electors.The previous representative from Madison County was Democrat Ralph R. Buck (1912‚Äì1976), who like Patrick is interred at Patrick Cemetery in Madison County. The first Republican representative elected in Madison and Carroll counties,\\"Danny Lee Patrick\\", Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, July 29, 2009 Patrick defeated Teague by thirty- three votes in 1966 and by some three hundred ballots in 1968. In 1970, when Rockefeller dropped below 40 percent in his bid for a third term, Patrick, then twenty-nine, was toppled by the Democrat Stephen A. Smith (born 1949), who polled 54 percent of the vote.Arkansas Secretary of State, General election returns, 1966, 1968, and 1970. In 1966, Patrick became the youngest person ever elected to the Arkansas legislature, one of only three Republicans in the Arkansas House during Rockefeller's first term; there were ninety-seven Democrats.The other Republican representatives in the Rockefeller era were George E. Nowotny of Fort Smith in Sebastian County in western Arkansas and Jim Sheets of Siloam Springs in Benton County in northwestern Arkansas. During Patrick's second term, Jim R. Caldwell, a Church of Christ minister then from Rogers in Benton County, became the first Republican in the Arkansas State Senate since Reconstruction. Another short-term GOP representative was the businessman Marshall Chrisman of Ozark in Franklin County. Four years later, 21-year-old Stephen Smith not only unseated Patrick but took the \\"youngest- legislator\\" designation for himself. In the campaign, Smith had questioned Patrick for having been \\"absent or not voting\\" on 263 recorded roll calls during the past legislative session. Smith later explained that this issue was \\"a cheap shot, but an effective one. [His voting record] was probably about average for all legislators, and most of the [missed] votes were on minor amendments or budget bills that had passed without opposition.\\" Smith estimated that the Rockefeller-backed Patrick outspent him possibly as much as 80‚Äì1.Smith later worked in the Arkansas campaign for George S. McGovern; in 1979, Smith became the executive assistant to newly elected Governor Bill Clinton. When Clinton was defeated for reelection after one term in 1980 by Frank White, Smith left politics for a career instead in college teaching. Educator Patrick obtained three degrees from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, bachelor's, master's, and specialist, all in professional education. From 1964 to 1971, he was a science teacher and basketball coach in Huntsville. He had remained in teaching while serving in the legislature through generous leave permitted by the school district. From 1971 to 1987, Patrick was the superintendent of the small St. Paul School in southwestern Madison County. On leaving the superintendency, Patrick for two years directed truck driving instruction at Northwest Technical Institute in Springdale, Arkansas. The institute provides trained drivers for such firms as the Arkansas-based J. B. Hunt Company. From 1989 until his retirement from public education in 1996, Patrick was superintendent for the Winslow School District in Washington County. The Winslow district was consolidated with Greenland schools in 2004 and renamed the \\"Greenland School District\\". In 2005, Patrick was handily elected to the board of the a combined seven-member school board created by the consolidation of the St. Paul and Huntsville schools. Arkansans elect school boards on a nonpartisan basis. He also served on the Washington and Madison County Drug Court Advisory Board. Private life Patrick operated a tax preparation business from his home in Delaney. With his son and brother, both named Jerry, Patrick planted considerable acreage in Madison County off Arkansas Highway 16, near Elkins in Washington County. He was an avid camper and a piano player of rock and roll. Apart from his son, Jerry Lee Patrick (born 1966), Patrick had a daughter, Tonya Lucille Patrick Taylor, from his first marriage to Katherine O'Neal \\"Kathy\\" Patrick, from whom he was divorced. Tonya and her husband, Warner H. Taylor (born 1953), are Fayetteville attorneys. Patrick died on July 26, 2009. He is interred at Patrick Cemetery in Madison County.

Ultimately, all Four Barbarians tribe will be completely disappeared through by Sinicization and absorbed into the Chinese Civilization in the later Chinese Dynasties. Terminology The Chinese mytho-geography and cosmography of the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046‚Äì256 BCE) was based upon a round heaven and a square earth. TiƒÅnxi√† Â§©‰∏ã \\"[everywhere] under heaven; the world\\" encompassed Hu√°xi√† ËèØÂ§è \\"China\\" (also known as Hu√°, Xi√†, etc.) in the center surrounded by non-Chinese \\"barbarian\\" peoples. See the Hua‚ÄìYi distinction article for the historical context of this literally Sinocentric worldview. The Four Barbarians construct, or a similar one, was a logical necessity for the ancient tiƒÅnxi√† system. Liu Junping and Huang Deyuan (2006:532) describe the universal monarch with combined political, religious, and cultural authorities: \\"According to the Chinese in the old times, heaven and earth were matched with yin and yang, with the heaven (yang) superior and the earth (yin) inferior; and the Chinese as an entity was matched with the inferior ethnic groups surrounding it in its four directions so that the kings could be valued and the barbarians could be rejected.\\" The authors (2006:535) propose that Chinese ideas about the \\"nation\\" and \\"state\\" of China evolved from the \\"casual use of such concepts as \\"TiƒÅnxi√†\\", \\"hainei\\"(four corners within the sea) and \\"Four Barbarians\\" (barbarians in four directions).\\" Located in the cardinal directions of tianxia were the s√¨fƒÅng \\"Four Directions/Corners\\", s√¨ t«î \\"Four Lands/Regions\\", s√¨ h«éi \\"Four Seas\\", and Four Barbarians \\"Four Barbarians/Foreigners\\". The (c. 3rd century BCE) Erya (9, Wilkinson 2000: 710) defines S√¨h«éi as \\" the place where the barbarians lived, hence by extension, the barbarians\\": \\"‰πùÂ§∑, ÂÖ´ÁãÑ,‰∏ÉÊàé, ÂÖ≠Ë†ª, Ë¨Ç‰πãÂõõÊµ∑\\" ‚Äì \\"the nine Y√≠, eight D√≠, seven R√≥ng, and six M√°n are called the four seas\\". These Four Barbarians directionally comprised Y√≠ Â§∑ to the east of China, M√°n Ë†ª in the south, R√≥ng Êàé in the west, and D√≠ ÁãÑ in the north. Unlike the English language with one general word barbarian meaning \\"uncultured or uncivilized peoples\\", Chinese had many specific exonyms for foreigners. Scholars such as Herrlee Glessner Creel (1970: 197) agree that Y√≠, M√°n, R√≥ng, and D√≠ were originally the Chinese names of particular ethnic groups or tribes. During the Spring and Autumn period (771‚Äì476 BC), these four exonyms were expanded into (Pu 2005: 45) \\"general designations referring to the barbarian tribes\\". The Russian anthropologist Mikhail Kryukov concluded. > Evidently, the barbarian tribes at first had individual names, but during > about the middle of the first millennium B.C., they were classified > schematically according to the four cardinal points of the compass. This > would, in the final analysis, mean that once again territory had become the > primary criterion of the we-group, whereas the consciousness of common > origin remained secondary. What continued to be important were the factors > of language, the acceptance of certain forms of material culture, the > adherence to certain rituals, and, above all, the economy and the way of > life. Agriculture was the only appropriate way of life for the Hua-Hsia. > (Jettmar 1983: 229) Yi, Man, Rong, and Di were further generalized into compounds (such as R√≥ngd√≠, M√°ny√≠, and M√°ny√≠r√≥ngd√≠) denoting \\"non-Chinese; foreigners; barbarians.\\" Hieroglyphics refer to these groups all have a section for indicating \\"animal/insect\\". Nowadays, Chinese characters have omitted this symbolic section, so the Chinese characters quoted above only have the \\"dog symbol\\" Áä≠ in the word D√≠ ÁãÑ. The Yi (\\"Barbarian\\") had both specific denotations (e.g., Huaiyi Ê∑ÆÂ§∑ \\"Huai River barbarians\\" and Xiyi Ë•øÂ§∑ \\"western barbarians\\") and generalized references to \\"barbarian\\" (e.g., S√¨y√≠ \\"Four Barbarians\\"). The sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank (1983: 440) says the name Yi \\"furnished the primary Chinese term for 'barbarian',\\" but \\"Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most civilized of the non-Chinese peoples.\\" The Old Chinese pronunciation of Modern Chinese y√≠ Â§∑ is reconstructed as (Bernhard Karlgren), *…§ier (Zhou Fagao), *l…ôj (William H. Baxter), and *l(…ô)i (Axel Schuessler). Schuessler (2007: 563) defines Yi as \\"The name of non-Chinese tribes, prob[ably] Austroasiatic, to the east and southeast of the central plain (Shandong, Hu√°i River basin), since the Spring and Autumn period also a general word for 'barbarian'\\", and proposes a \\"sea\\" etymology, \\"Since the ancient Yu√® (=Viet) word for 'sea' is said to have been y√≠, the people's name might have originated as referring to people living by the sea\\". William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart (2014) reconstruct the Old Chinese names of the four barbarian tribes as: * *l…ôj (eastern foreigners) * *mÀ§ro[n] (southern foreigners) * *nu≈ã (western foreigners) * *lÀ§ek (northern foreigners) Oracle bone script for shi Â∞∏ \\"corpse\\" and yi Â§∑ \\"barbarian\\" The modern character Â§∑ for yi, like the Qin Dynasty seal script, is composed of Â§ß \\"big\\" and Âºì \\"bow\\" ‚Äì but the earliest Shang Dynasty oracle bone script was used interchangeably for yi and shi Â∞∏ \\"corpse\\", depicting a person with bent back and dangling legs (Hanyu Da Zidian 1986 1: 527). The archeologist and scholar Guo Moruo believed the oracle graph for yi denotes \\"a dead body, i.e., the killed enemy\\", while the bronze graph denotes \\"a man bound by a rope, i.e., a prisoner or slave\\" (Huang 2013: 462). Ignoring this historical paleography, the Chinese historian K. C. Wu (1982: 107‚Äì108) claimed that Yi Â§∑ should not be translated as \\"barbarian\\" because the modern graph implies a big person carrying a bow, someone to perhaps be feared or respected, but not to be despised. The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi character dictionary, defines yi Â§∑ as \\"men of the east‚Äù Êù±Êñπ‰πã‰∫∫‰πü. The scholar L√©on Wieger provided multiple definitions to the term yi: ‚ÄúThe men Â§ß armed with bows Âºì, the primitive inhabitants, barbarians, borderers of the Eastern Sea, inhabitants of the South-West countries.\\" (1927:156) Hanyu Da Cidian (1993 3: 577), a major Chinese language dictionary, notes Siyi as derogatory: \\"Âè§‰ª£ËèØÂ§èÊóèÂØπÂõõÊñπÂ∞èÊï∞Ê∞ëÊóèÁöÑÁµ±Áß∞. Âê´ÊúâËΩªËîë‰πãÊÑè.\\" [Contrasting with the ancient Chinese people, a name for ethnic minorities in all four directions. Contains a pejorative meaning.] \\"Four barbarians\\" is the common English translation of Siyi. Compare these Chinese-English dictionary equivalents for Siyi: \\"the four barbarian tribes on the borders of ancient China\\" (Liang Shih-chiu et al. 1971), \\"the barbarians on borders of China\\" (Lin Yutang et al. 1992), and \\"four barbarian tribes on the borders\\" (John DeFrancis et al. 2003). Some scholars interpret the si \\"four\\" in Siyi as sifang ÂõõÊñπ \\"four directions\\". Liu Xiaoyuan (2004: 176, 10‚Äì11) says the meaning of Siyi \\"is not 'four barbarians' but numerous 'barbarous tribes' in the four directions\\". However, Liu also states that the term yi might have been used by the early Chinese to simply mean \\"ordinary others.\\" Yuri Pines (2005:62) translates Siyi as \\"barbarians of the four corners\\". In Chinese Buddhism, siyi ÂõõÂ§∑ or siyijie ÂõõÂ§∑Êàí abbreviates the si boluoyi ÂõõÊ≥¢ÁæÖÂ§∑ \\"Four Parajikas\\" (grave offenses that entail expulsion of a monk or nun from the sangha). Western Zhou usages Bronze inscriptions and reliable documents from the Western Zhou period (c. 1046‚Äì771 BCE) used the word Yi Â§∑ \\"barbarian\\" in two meanings, says Chinese sinologist Chen Zhi (2004: 202). First, Yi or Yifang Â§∑Êñπ designated a specific ethnic group that had battled against the Shang since the time of King Wu Ding. Second, Yi meant specifically or collectively (e.g., zhuyi Ë´∏Â§∑) peoples in the remote lands east and south of China, such as the well-known Dongyi Êù±Â§∑, Nanyi ÂçóÂ§∑, and Huaiyi Ê∑ÆÂ§∑. Western Zhou bronzes also record the names of some little-known Yi groups, such as the Qiyi ÊùûÂ§∑, Zhouyi ËàüÂ§∑, Ximenyi Ë•øÈñÄÂ§∑, Qinyi Áß¶Â§∑, and Jingyi‰∫¨Â§∑. Chen (2004: 200) notes, \\"These yi are not necessarily identical with the numerous yi in Eastern Zhou literature. On the contrary, except for the Huaiyi, Dongyi and Nanyi, these yi all seem to have vanished from the historical and inscriptional accounts of the Eastern Zhou.\\" Inscriptions on bronze gui vessels (including the Xun Ë©¢, Shiyou Â∏´ÈÖâ, and Shi Mi Âè≤ÂØÜ) do not always use the term yi Â§∑ in reference to alien people of physically different ethnic groups outside China. Chen (2004:201) says, \\"They classify certain groups of people residing in places within the region of Zhou control, such as the states of Qi Êùû, Jing ‰∫¨, Qin Áß¶ and Zhou Ëàü, as yi.\\" Expanding upon the research of Li Ling that Western Zhou bronze writings differentiate the Zhou people (Wangren Áéã‰∫∫, lit. \\"king's people\\") from other peoples (yi Â§∑), Chen (2004: 204) found three major categories: people of Zhou, people of Shang, and people of Yi (neither Zhou nor Shang). \\"The Zhou rulers treated the Shang remnant elites with courtesy and tolerance, whereas they treated yi people with less respect.\\" Shang people were employed in positions based upon their cultural legacy and education, such as zhu Á•ù \\"priest\\", zong ÂÆó \\"ritual official\\", bu Âçú \\"diviner\\", shi Âè≤ \\"scribe\\", and military commander. Yi people, who had a much lower status, served the rulers in positions such as infantry soldiers, palace guards, servants, and slave laborers. Chen (2004: 202) compares the social status of Yi with \\"xiangren Èôç‰∫∫, people captured from other states or ethnicities, or their descendants.\\" Chen (2004:186) analyzed diachronic semantic changes in the twin concepts of Xia and Yi. During the Western Zhou, they were employed to distinguish \\"between the Zhou elite and non-Zhou people\\"; during the Eastern Zhou, they distinguished \\"between the central states and peripheral barbarian tribes in a geographical sense, as well as between Zhou subjects and non-Zhou subjects in a political sense.\\" Eastern Zhou canonical texts, says Chen (2004:197), \\"frequently assert a differentiation between Xia (or Zhongguo), meaning those states in the central plains subject to the Zhou sovereign, and Yi Â§∑, Di ÁãÑ, Rong Êàé, and Man Ë†ª, all of which could be used generally to refer to non-Chinese ethnic groups.\\" Among these four terms, Yi was most widely employed for \\"barbarian\\" clans, tribes, or ethnic groups. The Chinese classics used it in directional compounds (e.g., \\"eastern\\" Dongyi Êù±Â§∑, \\"western\\" Xiyi Ë•øÂ§∑, \\"southern\\" Nanyi, and \\"northern\\" Beiyi ÂåóÂ§∑), numerical (meaning \\"many\\") generalizations (\\"three\\" Sanyi ‰∏âÂ§∑, \\"four\\" Siyi ÂõõÂ§∑, and \\"nine\\" Jiuyi ‰πùÂ§∑), and groups in specific areas and states (Huaiyi Ê∑ÆÂ§∑, Chuyi Ê•öÂ§∑, Qinyi Áß¶Â§∑, and Wuyi Âê≥Â§∑). Eastern Zhou usages Zhou Dynasty cosmography of Huaxia and the Siyi: Dongyi in the east, Nanman in the south, Xirong in the west, and Beidi in the north. The Chinese classics contain many references to the Siyi \\"Four Barbarians\\". Around the late Spring and Autumn period (771‚Äì476 BCE) or early Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BCE), the names Man, Yi, Rong, and Di became firmly associated with the cardinal directions. Yi changed from meaning a specific \\"barbarians in the east\\" to \\"barbarians\\" generally, and two new words ‚Äì Siyi and Man-Yi-Rong-Di Ë†ªÂ§∑ÊàéÁãÑ ‚Äì referred to \\"all non-Zhou barbarians in the four directions\\". The Zuozhuan and Mozi contain the earliest extant occurrences of Siyi. The (early 4th century BCE) Zuozhuan commentary to the Chunqiu (\\"Spring and Autumn Annals\\") uses Siyi four times. > The affair [presenting Rong prisoners and spoils of war to Duke Zhuang] was > contrary to rule. When a prince has gained success over any of the wild > tribes, he presents to spoils to the king, who employs them to terrify other > tribes. (Zhuang 31, tr. Legge 1872: 119) > It is virtue by which the people of the Middle State are cherished; it is by > severity that the wild tribes around are awed. (Duke Xi 25, tr. Legge 1872: > 196) > I have heard that, when the officers of the son of Heaven are not properly > arranged, we may learn from the wild tribes all about. (Duke Zhao 17, tr. > Legge 1872:668) > Anciently, the defenses of the sons of Heaven were the rude tribes on every > side of the kingdom; and when their authority became low, their defenses > were the various States. (Duke Zhao 23, tr. Legge 1872:700) In addition, the Zuozhuan has an early usage of Man-Yi-Rong-Di Ë†ªÂ§∑ÊàéÁãÑ meaning \\"all kinds of barbarians\\". > When any of the wild tribes, south, east, west, or north, do not obey the > king's commands, and by their dissoluteness and drunkenness are violating > all the duties of society, the kind gives command to attack them. (Cheng 3, > tr. Legge 1872: 349) The (c. 4th century BCE) Mozi has one occurrence of Siyi referring to King Wu of Zhou. > After King Wu had conquered the Shang dynasty and received the gifts > bestowed by God, he assigned guardians to the various spirits, instituted > sacrifices to Zhou's ancestors, the former kings of Shang, and opened up > communications with the barbarians of the four quarters, so that there was > no one in the world who did not pay him allegiance. (Against Offensive > Warfare, tr. Watson 2003: 61) The (c. 4th century BCE) Guanzi recounts how Duke Huan of Qi (d. 643 BCE) conquered all his enemies, including the Dongyi Êù±Â§∑, Xirong Ë•øÊàé, Nanman ÂçóË†ª, and Beidi ÂåóÁãÑ. > Further to the west, he subjugated the Western Yu, of Liusha and for the > first time the Rong people of Qin were obedient. Therefore, even, though the > soldiers went forth only once, their great accomplishments [victories] > numbered twelve, and as a consequence none of the eastern Yi, western Rong, > southern Man, northern Di, or the feudal lords of the central states failed > to submit. (Xioao Kuang, tr. Rickett 1998: 341) This text (Ba Yan, tr. Rickett 1998: 365) also recommends, \\"To use the states bordering the four seas to attack other states bordering the four seas is a condition distinguishing the central states.\\" The (c. 4th century BCE) Confucian Analects does not use Siyi, but does use Jiuyi ‰πùÂ§∑ \\"Nine Barbarians\\" (9/19, tr. Waley 1938: 141), \\"The Master wanted to settle among the Nine Wild Tribes of the East. Someone said, I am afraid you would find it hard to put up with their lack of refinement. The Master said, Were a true gentleman to settle among them there would soon be no trouble about lack of refinement.\\" Yidi Â§∑ÁãÑ \\"Eastern and Northern Barbarians\\" occurs twice (3/5, tr. Waley 1938: 94‚Äì5; 13/19, 176), \\"\\"The Master said, The barbarians of the East and North have retained their princes. They are not in such a state of decay as we in China\\"; \\"The Master said, In private life, courteous, in public life, diligent, in relationships, loyal. This is a maxim that no matter where you may be, even amid the barbarians of the east or north, may never be set aside.\\" This text has an indirect reference to \\"barbarians\\" (5/6, tr. Waley 1938: 108), \\"The Master said, The Way makes no progress. I shall get upon a raft and float out to sea.\\" The (c. 290 BCE) Confucianist Mencius (1A/7, tr. Lau 1970: 57) uses Siyi once when Mencius counsels King Xuan of Qi (r. 319‚Äì301 BCE) against territorial expansion: \\"You wish to extend your territory, to enjoy the homage of Ch'in and Ch'u, to rule over the Central Kingdoms and to bring peace to the barbarian tribes on the four borders. Seeking the fulfillment of such an ambition by such means as you employ is like looking for fish by climbing a tree.\\" This text (3A/4, tr. Lau 1970: 103) uses Yi Â§∑ in quoting Confucius, \\"I have heard of the Chinese converting barbarians to their ways, but not of their being converted to barbarian ways.\\" The Mencius uses western Xiyi Ë•øÂ§∑ four times (three contrasting with northern Beidi ÂåóÁãÑ), eastern Dongyi Êù±Â§∑ once, and Yidi Â§∑ÁãÑ once. Three repeated Xiyi occurrences (1B/11, tr. Lau 1970: 69; cf. 3B/5 and 7B/4) describe Tang of Shang establishing the Shang Dynasty: \\"With this he gained the trust of the Empire, and when he marched on the east, the western barbarians complained, and when he marched on the south, the northern barbarians complained. They all said, 'Why does he not come to us first?'\\" Dongyi occurs in a claim (4B/1, tr. Lau 1970: 128) that the legendary Chinese sages Shun and King Wen of Zhou were Yi: \\"Mencius said, 'Shun was an Eastern barbarian; he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T'iao. Ken Wen was a Western barbarian; he was born in Ch'i Chou and died in Pi Ying.\\" Yidi occurs in context (3B/9, tr. Lau 1970: 115) with the Duke of Zhou, \\"In ancient times, Yu controlled the Flood and brought peace to the Empire; the Duke of Chou subjugated the northern and southern barbarians, drove away the wild animals, and brought security to the people.\\" The (c. 3rd century BCE) Xunzi uses Siyi twice in one chapter. > If your deportment is respectful and reverent, your heart loyal and > faithful, if you use only those methods sanctioned by ritual principles and > moral duty, and if your emotional disposition is one of love and humanity, > then though you travel throughout the empire, and though you find yourself > reduced to living among the Four Yi Â§∑ tribes, everyone would consider you to > be an honorable person.

(On > Self Cultivation, tr. Knoblock 1988: 154‚Äì155) John Knoblock (1988: 278) notes, \\"The 'Four Yi tribes' refers to the barbarians surrounding the Chinese \\"Middle Kingdom\\" and does not designate particular peoples.\\" The Xunzi uses Man-Yi-Rong-Di once. > Accordingly, [Ë´∏Â§è] all the states of Xia Chinese have identical obligations > for service to the king and have identical standards of conduct. The > countries of Man, Yi, Rong, and Di barbarians perform the same obligatory > services to the kind, but the regulations governing them are not the same. ‚Ä¶ > The Man and Yi nations do service according to treaty obligations. The Rong > and Di do irregular service. (Rectifying Theses, tr. Knoblock 1994: 38‚Äì39) The (3rd‚Äì1st centuries BCE) Liji uses Siyi once. > But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and > hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose > them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to > bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons > and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\\" It is > only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, > driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell > along with him in the Middle Kingdom. (Great Learning, tr. Legge 1885: 367) The Liji also gives detailed information about the Four Barbarian peoples. > The people of those [wufang ‰∫îÊñπ] five regions ‚Äì the Middle states, and the > Rong, Yi, (and other wild tribes round them) ‚Äì had all their several > natures, which they could not be made to alter.

(Wang Zhi, tr. Legge 1885: 229‚Äì230, changed to Pinyin) The Shujing history uses Siyi in two forged \\"Old Text\\" chapters. > Yi said, 'Alas! be cautious! Admonish yourself to caution, when there seems > to be no occasion for anxiety.

(52, tr. Legge 1865: 249) The (c. 239 BCE) L√ºshi Chunqiu has two occurrences of Siyi. > Seeking depth, not breadth, reverently guarding one affair ‚Ä¶ When this > ability is utterly perfect, the barbarian Yi states of the four quarters are > tranquil. (17/5, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 424) > If your desires are not proper and you use them to govern your state, it > will perish.

Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 498) The Daoist Zhuangzi uses Siyi twice in the (c. 3rd century BCE) \\"Miscellaneous Chapters\\". > The sword of the son of heaven has a point made of Swallow Gorge and Stone > Wall ‚Ä¶ It is embraced by the four uncivilized tribes, encircled by the four > seasons, and wrapped around by the Sea of Po. (30, tr. Mair 1994: 315) > Master Mo declared, \\"Long ago, when Y√º was trying to stem the flood waters, > he cut channels from the Yangtze and the Yellow rivers and opened > communications with the four uncivilized tribes and the nine regions. (33, > tr. Mair 1994: 327) Han usages Many texts dating from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) used the ethnonyms Yi and Siyi. For example, the (139 BCE) Huainanzi, which is an eclectic compilation attributed to Liu An, uses Siyi \\"Four Barbarians\\" in three chapters (and Jiuyi \\"Nine Barbarians\\" in two). > Yu understood that the world had become rebellious and thereupon knocked > down the wall [built by his father Gun to protect Xia], filled in the moat > surrounding the city, gave away their resources, burned their armor and > weapons, and treated everyone with beneficence. And so the lands beyond the > Four Seas respectfully submitted, and the four Yi tribes brought tribute. > (1.6, tr. Major et al. 2010: 54) > The Three Miao [tribes] bind their heads with hemp; the Qiang people bind > their necks: the [people of] the Middle Kingdom use hat and hatpin; the Yue > people shear their hair. In regard to getting dressed, they are as one. ‚Ä¶ > Thus the rites of the four Yi [\\"barbarians\\"] are not the same, [yet] they > all revere their ruler, love their kin, and respect their elder brothers. > (11.7, tr. Major et al. 2010: 407) > When Shun was the Son of Heaven, he plucked the five-stringed qin and > chanted the poems of the \\"Southern Airs\\" [a Shijing section], and thereby > governed the world. Before the Duke of Zhou had gathered provisions or taken > the bells and drums from their suspension cords, the four Yi tribes > submitted. (20.16, tr. Major et al. 2010: 813) > Thus when the Son of Heaven attains the Way, he is secure [even] among the > four Yi [tribes of \\"barbarians\\"]; when the son of Heaven loses the way, he > is secure [only] among the Lords of the Land. (20.29, tr. Major et al. 2010: > 828) References to the \\"Four Barbarians\\" are especially common among Han-era histories; Siyi occurs 18 times in the Shiji, 62 in the Han Shu, and 30 in the Hou Han Shu. To evaluate the traditional \\"civilized vs. barbarian\\" dichotomy that many scholars use as a blanket description of Chinese attitudes towards outsiders, Erica Brindley (2003) examined how the Chinese classics ethnically described the southern Yue peoples. Brindley found that many early authors presented the Yue in various ways and not in a simplistic manner. For instance, Sima Qian's (c. 109‚Äì91 BCE) Shiji history traces the Chinese lineage of King Goujian of Yue back to Yu the Great, legendary founder of the Xia Dynasty (41, tr. Brindley 2003: 27): \\"Gou Jian, the king of Yue, was the descendant of Yu and the grandson of Shao Kang of the Xia. He was enfeoffed at Kuaiji and maintained ancestral sacrifices to Yu. [The Yue] tattooed their bodies, cut their hair short, and cleared out weeds and brambles to set up small fiefs.\\" On the one hand, this statement conceptualizes the Yue people through alien habits and customs, but on the other, through kinship-based ethnicity. Sima Qian also states (114, tr. Brindley 2003: 28): \\"Although the Yue are considered to be southern (man Ë†ª) barbarians (yi Â§∑), is it not true that their ancestors had once benefited the [Yue] people with their great merit and virtue?\\" Sima denigrates the Yue by calling them ‚ÄúMan Yi,‚Äù but he also \\"counterbalances such language and descriptions by proving the honor of Yue ancestry and certain of its individual members.\\" (2003:31) Brindley further notes that, > I translate \\"Man Yi\\" above as \\"Southern barbarian,\\" and not just as the Man > and Yi peoples, because it is clear that Sima Qian does not think of them as > two distinct groups. Rather, it appears that the term Yi does not point to > any particular group ‚Ä¶ but to a vague category of degraded other. Man, on > the other hand, denotes not the specific name of the group (\\"Yue\\") but the > general southern location of this specific derogatory other. In the literary > tradition, the four directions (north, south, east, west) are linked with > four general categories of identification denoting a derogatory other (di, > man, yi, rong). (2003:29) In the end, Brindley concludes that, > Much scholarship dealing with the relationship between self and other in > Chinese history assumes a simple bifurcation between civilized Chinese or > Han peoples and the barbarian other. In this analysis of the concepts of the > Yue and Yue ethnicity, I show that such a simple and value-laden > categorization did not always exist, and that some early authors > differentiated between themselves and others in a much more complicated and, > sometimes, conflicted manner. (2003:31‚Äì2) The complexities of the meaning and usage of Yi is also shown in the Hou Han Shu, where in its chapter on the Dongyi, the books describes the Dongyi countries as places where benevolence rules and the gentlemen do not die. Later usages Chinese Yi \\"barbarian\\" and Siyi continued to be used long after the Han dynasty, as illustrated by the following examples from the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) and Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912). The Dutch sinologist Kristofer Schipper (1994:74) cites a (c. 5th‚Äì6th century) Celestial Masters Daoist document (Xiaren Siyi shou yaolu ‰∏ã‰∫∫ÂõõÂ§∑ÂèóË¶ÅÁ±ô) that substitutes Qiang for Man in the S√¨y√≠. S√¨y√≠ gu«én (lit. \\"Four Barbarians building\\") was the name of the Ming imperial \\"Bureau of Translators\\" for foreign tributary missions to China. Norman Wild (1943: 617) says that in the Zhou Dynasty, interpreters were appointed to deal with envoys bringing tribute or declarations of loyalty. The Liji records regional \\"interpreter\\" words for the S√¨y√≠: ji ÂØÑ for the Dongyi, xiang Ë±° for the Nanman, didi ÁãÑÈûÆ for the Xirong, and yi Ë≠Ø for the Beidi. In the Sui, Tang, and Song Dynasties, tributary affairs were handled by the S√¨fƒÅng gu«én . The Ming Yongle Emperor established the S√¨y√≠ gu«én \\"Bureau of Translators\\" for foreign diplomatic documents in 1407, as part of the imperial Hanlin Academy. Ming histories also mention Hu√°r√©n Y√≠guƒÅn ËèØ‰∫∫Â§∑ÂÆò \\"Chinese barbarian officials\\" (Chan 1968: 411) denoting people of Chinese origin employed by rulers of the \\"barbarian vassal states\\" in their tributary embassies to China. When the Qing Dynasty revived the Ming S√¨y√≠gu«én , the Manchus, who \\"were sensitive to references to barbarians\\" (Wild 1945: 620), changed the name from pejorative y√≠ Â§∑ \\"barbarian\\" to y√≠ ÂΩù \\"Yi people (a Chinese ethnic minority)\\". In 1656, the Qing imperial court issued an edict to Mongolia about a territorial dispute (tr. Zhao 2006: 7), \\"Those barbarians (fanyi) who paid tribute to Mongolia during the Ming should be administered by Mongolia. However, those barbarians submitting to the former Ming court should be subjects of China\\" After China began expansion into Inner Asia, Gang Zhao (2006: 13) says, \\"Its inhabitants were no longer to be considered barbarians, a term suitable for the tributary countries, and an error on this score could be dangerous.\\" In a 1787 memorial sent to the Qianlong Emperor, the Shaanxi governor mistakenly called a Tibetan mission an y√≠sh3 Â§∑‰Ωø \\"barbarian mission\\". The emperor replied, \\"Because Tibet has long been incorporated into our territory, it is completely different from Russia, which submits to our country only in name. Thus, we cannot see the Tibetans as foreign barbarians, unlike the Russians\\". The use of Y√≠ Â§∑ continued into modern times. The Oxford English Dictionary defines barbarian (3.c) as, \\"Applied by the Chinese contemptuously to foreigners\\", and cites the 1858 Treaty of Tientsin prohibiting the Chinese from calling the British \\"Y√≠\\". (Article LI) states, \\"It is agreed, that henceforward the character \\"I\\" Â§∑ ('barbarian') shall not be applied to the Government or subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, in any Chinese official document.\\" This prohibition in the Treaty of Tientsin had been the end result of a long dispute between the Qing and British officials regarding the translation, usage and meaning of Y√≠. Many Qing officials argued that the term did not mean ‚Äúbarbarians,‚Äù but their British counterparts disagreed with this opinion. Using the linguistic concept of heteroglossia, Lydia Liu analyzed the significance of y√≠ in Articles 50 and 51 as a \\"super- sign\\": > The law simply secures a three-way commensurability of the hetero-linguistic > sign Â§∑/i/barbarian by joining the written Chinese character, the romanized > pronunciation, and the English translation together into a coherent semantic > unit. [Which] means that the Chinese character yi becomes a hetero- > linguistic sign by virtue of being informed, signified, and transformed by > the English word \\"barbarian\\" and must defer its correct meaning to the > foreign counterpart. ... That is to say, whoever violates the integrity of > the super-sign Â§∑/i/barbarian ... risks violating international law itself. > (2004:33) See also * Four Perils, which included \\"barbarian\\" tribes in ancient Chinese history * Five Barbarians, later groups that settled in northern China References *Baxter, William H. and Laurent Sagart. 2014.

It was established during a period in which Dawson City was expected to become an important regional city, and used modern techniques and equipment imported from California. It was initially successful, selling 68,748 gallons of beer in 1905, but Dawson's population declined and growing temperance attitudes threatened the business. O'Brien sold the company in 1915, and in 1919 prohibition forced its closure. The brewery was abandoned, and the remains of the site are now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation. Background Site of the future brewery shown in 1898, marked in red Dawson City was founded in 1896 in the early days of the Klondike Gold Rush, alongside the Yukon River in north-western Canada. Swelled by would-be gold-miners and adventurers, Dawson's population soared to 30,000 at the height of the rush in 1898. Dawson declined in size again as many of the immigrants left, but it was appointed the Territorial Capital of the new Yukon Territory in 1900, and by the following year it had a stable population of around 10,000.; Imported beer had been very expensive during the initial gold rush, costing around $100 a barrel, or approximately $1 a bottle. The Dawson City Brewery had been established in the city by a businessman called T. Krozner in 1898 to manufacture a local alternative, but this had closed by 1902 as the city's population declined and prices fell. Thomas O'Brien was a Canadian miner and businessman who had prospered considerably during the rush, investing widely in businesses across the city to become one of the wealthiest of the local hotel and saloon owners.; O'Brien had considerable confidence that Dawson would continue to grow as an economic powerhouse in the region, both because of its remaining gold deposits and the presence of Canadian government institutions. O'Brien believed that transportation costs would inevitably keep the prices for imported beer high in Dawson and make a local brewery a profitable venture, with the potential to export its product into the neighbouring U.S. district of Alaska.; Creation The legal paperwork for the O'Brien Brewing and Malting Company was completed in late 1903 and the company was formally created in February 1904 by O'Brien as the majority shareholder with 77 percent of the stock, and six other investors.; The company had an initial capital of $200,000 and owned $53,000 of land in Klondike City, just across the river from Dawson, which O'Brien had sold to the new company. George Mero was employed to build the new brewery at considerable speed - 15 days were allowed for the work's completion - converting O'Brien's old building for its new use.; The brewery was situated alongside the Klondike Mines Railway terminal, also owned by O'Brien. It opened for business in April. O'Brien intended the brewery to be a modern facility similar to those in California, and brought in Charles Bolbrugge, a brewer from San Francisco, to run the operation.; The facility probably took the form of a tower brewery, which minimised the requirements for power supplies, and had a cooperage built adjacent to it. Some of the equipment was probably reused from the local Eldorado Bottling works, which had closed three years before, and possibly the old Dawson City Brewery, which was then combined with up-to-date steam pumps, bottling machines and an artificial refrigeration plant. A variety of second-hand bottles were probably collected from around Dawson City, many of which were then reused at the new brewery, the remainder being discarded along the nearby river shore. The malt and hops for the brewing process were imported from California. A variety of products were manufactured over the lifetime of the brewery, including lager, \\"Blue Label\\" and \\"Special Brew\\" branded lagers, \\"Red Label\\" steam beer, \\"Bohemiam\\" bock, porter, \\"Champagne\\" cider, ginger beer and various non-alcoholic sodas and drinks.; Newspaper reports suggested that between 1,200 and 1,500 gallons of beer could be produced a day and, by September, the brewery's lager was selling at $3.50 for a dozen bottles. The brewery quickly dominated the local market in its first year of operation, producing 68,748 gallons in 1905 and pushing sales of imported beer down by almost half. O'Brien became the leader of the Yukon Independent Party and held political meetings in the brewery, leading to his faction becoming known as the \\"steam beers\\". He used his political connections to support the imposition of a 50 cent per gallon tax on foreign beer in the Yukon in 1907. Decline The brewery's beer sales in gallons, 1904-10 O'Brien's company soon encountered problems. Despite expectations, Dawson City's population began to decline again: one resident, Laura Berton, later described how people were \\"trickling from it like water from a leaky barrel\\".; By 1909 the population had fallen to 2,000, driving down demand for the brewery's products. Export sales in the highly competitive Alaskan marketplace failed to materialise. The temperance movement also gained ground, almost managing to pass a law introducing prohibition across the territory in 1916. The number of licensed saloons dropped sharply, from 21 in 1902 to only 6 in 1906, and other sales outlets were curtailed. Despite the company's efforts to advertise their product - promoting the health benefits of beer and the company's role in championing a local, pioneering industry - sales dropped considerably after 1908, falling to 31,305 gallons by 1910. Closure In 1915, O'Brien, by now in poor health as a consequence of alcohol abuse, sold his shares in the brewery to Joseph Segber, who appointed F. Vinnicomb to manage the company day-to-day.; The sale of alcohol in the territory was suspended in the autumn of 1919, full prohibition followed the next year, and the company ceased trading. Initially the premises were kept maintained, probably in case the company was able to reopen, but most of the equipment was sold off to a new brewery in Fairbanks in 1933. The buildings were soon dismantled, probably for firewood, and vegetation reclaimed the site. The rusting brewery steam boiler remained on the site, surrounded by mounds of used bottles, many of which were dug up and removed by collectors over subsequent years, leaving perhaps over 3,000 intact bottles still in place. The remains of a Perfection Bottling Machine and a Crown capping device were left buried beneath the debris. In 1977 the site was threatened with destruction as part of wider plans to dredge the Klondike City site for gold. The land was instead purchased by the Government of Canada, and the site is now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation. An archaeological investigation of the site took place in 1998, documenting the structure of the building and analysing the industrial remains.

He used the stage name Virginia Drew Prescott.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/54438528/ Biography Theatre poster featuring Blanche Walsh and MacDowell, 1899, most likely in the play Gismonda Willet Melbourne MacDowell was born in Little Washington, New Jersey (now South River, New Jersey). He had an older brother named E. A. MacDowell, who was the father of future actress Claire McDowell. As a teen Melbourne went to sea in the Merchant Marines eventually becoming a mate. Back in the US he had his first acting experience in Montreal at a theatre where he was a ticket seller, assistant doorkeeper and where his brother was employed as an actor. MacDowell was occasionally asked upon to act. Here in Montreal he got a chance to act with Adelaide Neilson, a legend in her short life, in the Shakespeare play As You Like It. Neilson played one of the main characters Rosalind and MacDowell was briefly on as Charles the wrestler. By 1877 MacDowell made his first professional acting appearance in the United States at the Boston Museum where his brother E.A. was an actor. In 1888 MacDowell became acquainted with Fanny Davenport playing in La Tosca with her. In 1889 the two married. He continued to act with her in a series of emotional plays until her death in 1898. After Davenport died MacDowell became associated professionally with her successor, Blanche Walsh, who continued playing Davenport's famous and emotional roles. A large man weighing over 200 pounds, MacDowell played the hero or distinct character in plays. Films MacDowell began appearing in silent films in 1917 by which time he was long a stage veteran. His costars were such actors as William S. Hart, Lon Chaney, Charles Ray, Enid Bennett and numerous others. Though he lived until the early 1940s, his film career ended in 1928 with the end of silent films. He returned for one sound film short in 1932, A Fool About Women with Andy Clyde and Vernon Dent. Several films that Melbourne MacDowell appeared in survive today and can be found on DVD, particularly two of his outings with Lon Chaney, Nomads of the North and Outside the Law as well as the restored Bebe Daniels 1928 feature Feel My Pulse. Marriages, death MacDowell was married several times, his most famous marriage was his first to the legendary Fanny Davenport.

Design and development right Flight described the L.71 as a flying boat on wheels because, in the 1920s, such aircraft were almost the only modern pusher biplanes. Visually, the most unusual feature was the extreme stagger, introduced to optimise the view for each of the occupants of its tandem cockpits. Both wings had spruce spars, continuous from tip to tip, and spruce ribs. The larger upper wing had no dihedral but carried the ailerons; the lower wing had 1.5¬∞ of dihedral. Outward leaning, aluminium tube N-form interplane struts braced the wings but there was none of the usual flying wire bracing in the single bay; the wings were aerodynamically quite thick, allowing them to be internally braced cantilevers. The upper wing centre section was supported by a shorter pair of outward leaning N struts from the upper fuselage. Though the lower plane was set at mid-fuselage the interplane gap was large, to provide clearance for the two blade propeller. The pusher configuration Siemens-Halske Sh 10 five cylinder radial was aerodynamically faired into the upper wing trailing edge but was not structurally connected to it; instead, four tubes from the fuselage formed the engine mounting. The fuel tank was within the forward section of the upper wing, feeding the engine by gravity with some pressure assistance. The fuselage was of mixed construction. From the nose to the lower wing leading edge, a region which included the two cockpits, it was a flat sided wooden structure, covered in plywood; aft, it was built from wire braced, welded steel tubes and fabric covering. This section included the lower wing mounting. The tail surfaces were fabric covered, over mixed steel and duraluminum frames. The incidence of the tailplane could be adjusted for pitch trimming. The L.71 had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage with short axles hinged to the lower fuselage longerons and forward braced with short horizontal struts. Sprung, telescopic legs with rubber shock absorbers were attached to the outer end of the axles and to the upper fuselage longerons. The L.71 was flight testing by late January 1926. Two were built.

Early life Mayrs the son of Irish immigrants from Coleraine, Northern Ireland. Mayrs's father was an infantry soldier in WW1 with the 43rd battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. The family eventually moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where Mayrs attended Magee High School and won the Sir Ernest MacMillan Fine Art Scholarship‚Äîa prize which enabled him to enroll at the Vancouver School of Art (1957-1961). In 1960, he won the Canadian Student Typography Design Award from the Roland Paper Company in Montreal, Quebec. Career After graduating from the Vancouver School of Art in 1961, Mayrs was hired as a graphic artist at James Lovick Limited Advertising Agency. He worked as an art director on various local, provincial and national accounts, including Scott Paper, Nabob Foods, BC Government, Vancouver Sun, BC Telephone and Bridgestone Tires. In 1970, Mayrs won a National Newspaper Awards for Public Service campaigns from the Toronto Telegram. The Vancouver-owned Lovick agency was sold to Baker Advertising of Toronto in 1970, after which it was sold to Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne of New York. During this time, Mayrs became a Creative Director and Vice President of the company. In 1985, he led the Vancouver Baker Lovick/BBDO creative team in developing and producing the worldwide advertising for Vancouver's World Fair, EXPO 86. In 1986, Mayrs and his business partner Douglas Heal formed the advertising agency and PR firm, Dome Advertising, where he held the title of President and Creative Director.Canadian Tv Advertisers Struggle To Find Right Way Of Selling Condoms That same year, he developed the marketing and creative strategy for Gordon Campbell's winning Vancouver mayoralty campaign.

In 1999, Mayrs was hired by the North Shore Outlook newspaper as their political cartoonist. His cartoons ‚Äì a combination of limericks and drawings of local politicians and community interests ‚Äì were eventually judged overly controversial, and Mayrs was fired in 2004. His five years of original cartoon artwork was subsequently purchased by Simon Fraser University for their department of Special Collections. In the early 2000s, Mayrs enjoyed a brief stint in acting, appearing in the television series, Dark Angel, 'Freak Nation' Episode 22, which resulted in a cameo appearance as a vigilante, directed by James Cameron. He also appeared in a 2005 Hasbro commercial for their game Guesstures. Mayrs has exhibited his work in group, juried and solo shows over the years in locales which include the Vancouver Art Gallery, Seymour Art Gallery, Diane Farris Gallery, Woodworks Gallery and Maui Cultural Center.Three dozen B.C. artists heralded Since 2003, Mayrs has focused his considerable creative energies on writing, illustrating and publishing fine press limited-edition letterpress books.

Education Yates got his BFA from the University of Michigan in 1995 and his MFA from Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, CA in 2000. Early career / Fast Friends Inc. Yates's early work in the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, was typified by a collaborative ethos and bridging the gap between various genres, namely art, music, fashion and design. Raised in Detroit and while still in his teens, Yates became a friend and collaborator with funk/jazz/ fusion musician George Clinton. Speaking about Clinton and the musician's influence on his own practice, Yates says \\"I always thought of Clinton not as a musician but as a total artist. As much as the art world endeavours to branch out, it's still very specialized. To Clinton, making art was part of his normal trajectory. He was an artist- musician. And I always saw art as being a component of a lot of different movements and incredibly dependent on a group dynamic.\\" This way of thinking was a formative influence on his Yates' practice. After moving to Los Angeles to study with Mike Kelley, Mayo Thompson and Liz Larner in the MFA program at Art Center, Yates formed 'Fast Friends Inc.' a collaborative project to disseminate art outside the conventional gallery system and to distribute the work on the artist's own terms. Chris Kraus writes in Where Art Belongs \\"Yates is an exceptional artist. For six years as Fast Friends he created band posters for Ariel Pink, (Matt) Fishbeck (of the band Holy Shit) and others that are also original art works. Any study of the confluence between music and visual culture in the last two decades would cite Yates' work\\".Kraus 2011, p.29. The Fast Friends art works, which double as functional concert posters, are works on paper with mixed media and have been described as \\"each a colorful psychedelic explosion of creatures, captions, and hundreds of stickers\\" and \\"rough drawings and graphic riffs push to a visual density that quickly becomes a blur of coloured pencil and grotesque figuration. A central figure or head, ranging from fanciful creatures to Captain Beefheart, anchors the composition, and little droves of colour file out and disperse around the head, almost like oceans of saints around the godhead in Byzantine mosaics.\\" In the work Shit Age (2007), \\"witchy pyramid triangles cut out of Mylar surrounded by rivers of watery brush strokes are infested with animal eyes, pot seeds and pills like buried in gobs of glittery glue...the deranged menagerie seemingly supported on a nest of hatched lines. Weed green rods of lightning burst out of the sky\\".Kraus 2011, p.30. Describing these works, Yates says they \\"were all infused with inside jokes, inside critiques, inside information\\".Kraus 2011, p.30. The \\"hatched lines\\" and Mylar, Kraus speaks of, will also reappear in Yates' more formal, pared down paintings.Lehrer-Graiwer 2009, p.1. The Fast Friends inc. works were shown in the exhibition \\"Burnout, The Fast Friends Inc. Project, A Depiction of DYI Dandyism and Pop by Cult Hero Jason Yates\\" at Tiny Creatures gallery Los Angeles 2007Kraus 2011, p.29. and at Circus Gallery, Los Angeles in 2009.Schad, 2009, p.89. Paintings, sculptures and installations Yates' exhibitions are characterized by installations including paintings, sculptures, wall drawings, and hand etched mirrors. These installations have been called \\"not a collection of well installed objects, which it also is, but a total experience, a site-specific installation whose whole far outweighs the sum of its parts.\\" Yates' paintings are large scale single or two-panel works, some three-dimensional and free standing, and covered in a cross hatched motif with the canvas being cut away in regular patterns to create a cascading effect. In these works \\"Yates invites us to not only explore the surface, but like Lucio Fontana, he lets you look behind the normally unseen space behind the mark making.\\" They have been described by Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight as starting \\"with clusters of parallel strokes reminiscent of Jasper Johns' hatch paintings from the 70's...the canvas is cut in scores of scalloped shapes, curled away from the surface and held out from it by a rod glued inside\\" These flaps are backed with a flat color or metallic Mylar in silver or gold, as are the newly exposed surfaces underneath.\\" The effect of the Mylar in the canvas \\"complicate the visual appeal, adding unexpected flashes of reflected internal light\\" as the viewer moves around the paintings. The cross hatched motif, at once obsessive and meditative, recurs throughout Yates' two dimensional works, appearing in hand etched mirrors, wall drawings, wallpaper and as mentioned above some of the Fast Friends Inc. works and \\"Yates‚Äô incessant modular mark making affirms a zoned out, altered experience of time‚Äôs passing and an insistently manual reclamation of space as a place to get lost in\\" Lehrer- Graiwer 2009, p.1. Yates' sculptures called \\"Monk Boxes\\" are both aesthetic objects and functional ones. Typically made of black stained red maple, and pierced with holes in a regular sequence along the edges through which are wrapped with thick rope, the works have a simple, austere beauty and in these works and others \\"Yates shares with monastic orders a devotion to a toiling obsessiveness marked by blunt repetition.\\" For his show at anna meliksetian  MJBriggs gallery Every Self Portrait is a Cry for Help in 2012, Yates' repurposed the forms of these sculptures to create an installation, a bedroom environment including a king size bed, vanities, and side tables. The sculptures were complemented by hand etched mirrors, paintings, artist designed wall paper and hand silkscreened sheets, all of which featured the artist's characteristic cross hatching patterns in various forms. The installation played with the context of the neighborhood, which has many furniture shops, as well as being a comment on the city itself, a decadent environment, a \\"place to die\\" as the artist has called it.

Early life  Born in Warsaw in Poland and an only child, her father was a non-observant Polish Jew who had been a local government official before World War II during which she and her parents were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1942 her father arranged for his 9-year-old daughter and her aunt to go to work at a Jewish-owned leather factory outside the ghetto walls, and from here they both escaped. Posner survived the remainder of the war by pretending to be a young Polish Catholic girl called Irena Slabowska. She was aided in this deception by the fact that she and her parents had always spoken Polish together rather than Yiddish. It is believed that her parents were killed in Treblinka. Posner was a young child undergoing the most traumatic event in her life. As a nine-year old she was faced with a life or death decision. She knew that if she tried to escape the concentration camp that she would either be shot or die anyway. She and her aunt took that risk and escaped. They made it out of the ghetto walls alive. As for Posner's parents, they did not. Posner has an idea of what happened to her parents but she does not want to know exactly what happened. As if going through the Holocaust wasn't hard enough, Posner experienced another tragedy at the age of thirteen. Her hometown Warsaw was evacuated and she was moved to Germany. At that time, she was still known as \\"the little Catholic girl\\". She was taken as a prisoner of war to Germany, not as a Jew. Being a prisoner in Germany was not as bad as being a child in the concentration camps. In Germany, she was tortured but not beaten. After the war with Germany was over she moved to England and has lived there ever since. In the last 25 years in England she has re-enacted her life in a play called \\"Who Do We Think We Are,\\" choreographed plays, acted in celebrated movies, danced, and written a book. Arriving in the United Kingdom as a refugee at the end of World War II, she married Michael S. Posner in 1950. In the 1950s she became a dancer and choreographer with the London Contemporary Dance School. When in the early 1970s her husband went to New York to work for UNICEF Posner went with him and taught Physical Theatre at the Juilliard School in New York, and Brandeis University in Boston. During her nine years in the United States she trained as an actor with Uta Hagen, and gained an MA in Theatre Arts at Hunter College in 1980.Posner, Ruth Bits and Pieces of My Life R & MSP Publishing (2012) On returning to London she taught Physical Theatre at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the Central School of Speech and Drama.  Career  Later she concentrated on an acting career, and on television she appeared in Making News (1990), Love Hurts (1994), The Ruth Rendell Mysteries (1995), Bramwell (1997), To Anyone Who Can Hear Me (1999), Casualty (1987‚Äì2003), The Bill (2003), Coming Up for Air (2003), Timeless (2005), Apparitions (2008) and The Pharmacist (2012). In 2013, she was one of the main cast members in series 1 of Count Arthur Strong. Her film appearances include Leon the Pig Farmer (1992), Do I Love You? (2002) The Football Factory (2004) and Shemira (2017) . Stage roles include Hiawatha at the Bristol Old Vic (1991‚Äì92), The Dybbuk for the Royal Shakespeare Company (1992), The Tempest with the Actors Touring Company (1999), Woman in the Moon at the Arcola Theatre (2001), Ritual in Blood at the Nottingham Playhouse (2001) and Seven Jewish Children (2009) at the Royal Court Theatre. She speaks Polish, German, Italian and Hebrew.  Personal life  Posner worked at the London Contemporary Dance Company for 17 years, where she eventually met her husband Michael S. Posner. She and Michael had one son, who died at the age of 37. She and her husband have lived in England for the last 25 years. Published works Ruth always wanted to be a dancer and danced most of her life. She felt life through her dancing. During her 40s she decided to switch from dance to drama. Many people told her she wasn't going to \\"make it\\" in the theatre world because of her thick accent. Posner proved people wrong and became a popular actress. She has appeared in a Holocaust play about her life called Who Do We Think We Are? Along with drama and dancing she also wrote her autobiography, Bits and Pieces of My Life. The book mainly shares many descriptions of her Holocaust experiences and life after.

It was designed by Mint of the United States Chief Engraver James B. Longacre. The largest denomination of United States coin authorized by the Mint Act of 1792 was the eagle, or ten-dollar piece. The large amount of bullion being brought east after the discovery of gold in California in the 1840s caused Congress to consider new denominations of gold coinage. The gold dollar and double eagle were the result. After considerable infighting at the Philadelphia Mint, Chief Engraver James B. Longacre designed the double eagle, and it began to be issued for commerce in 1850. Only one 1849 double eagle is known to survive and it rests in the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian. The coin was immediately successful; merchants and banks used it in trade. It was struck until replaced by the Saint-Gaudens double eagle in 1907, and many were melted when President Franklin D. Roosevelt recalled gold coins from the public in 1933. Millions of double eagles were sent overseas in international transactions throughout its run to be melted or placed in bank vaults. Many of the latter have now been repatriated to feed the demand from collectors and those who desire to hold gold.  Inception  Under the Mint Act of 1792, the largest-denomination coin was the gold eagle, or ten-dollar piece. Also struck were a half eagle ($5) and quarter eagle ($2.50). Bullion flowed out of the United States for economic reasons for much of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The eagle's size made it convenient for use in international transactions, and, faced with the likelihood that most being struck were exported, the Director of the Mint Elias Boudinot ended its production in 1804. In 1838, coinage resumed after Congress revised the weight and fineness of American gold coins. The new eagle was struck to a design by Christian Gobrecht, who was one of the Mint's engravers. In 1836, the Public Ledger, a Philadelphia newspaper, proposed the issuance of both a gold dollar and a twenty-dollar piece; they wrote of the latter, \\"Twenty [silver dollars] are an encumbrance in a pocket ... if we are to have larger coins, let them be of gold. Along with the eagle, which has the size of the half dollar, we would recommend the double eagle, which [would be] of the size of our silver dollar, [and] would contain the value of twenty.\\" Others perceived a need for a large U.S. gold coin to be used in international transactions‚ÄîAmerican merchants sometimes used high-denomination Latin American gold coins for that purpose. No proposal for a gold twenty-dollar piece was considered until after the California Gold Rush, beginning in 1848, greatly increased the amount of the metal available in the United States. The increase in the supply of gold caused silver coins to be worth more than their face value, and they were heavily exported, generating new support for a gold dollar to take their place in commerce. The quantity of gold made a larger denomination desirable as well, to more efficiently convert gold to coins. In January 1849, North Carolina Congressman James Iver McKay amended his previously introduced legislation for a gold dollar to provide for a double eagle as well. He wrote to Mint Director Robert M. Patterson, who responded, \\"there can be no other objection to the Double eagle except that it is not needed. It will be a handsome coin, between the half dollar and dollar in size.\\" Concerned about likely Whig opposition to the coinage bill, McKay got his fellow Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to introduce the bill in the Senate on February 1, 1849‚ÄîAtherton was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. McKay introduced a version of the bill into the House on February 20; debate began the same day. The dollar was attacked on the ground it would be too small; the double eagle on the claim that it would be heavily abraded in circulation, and would become lightweight. McKay did not respond substantively, but stated that if no one wanted these denominations, they would be unasked-for at the Mint, and would not be coined. Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations. Ingersoll stated that a twenty-dollar piece would be \\"doubled into a ponderous and unparalleled size\\". Nevertheless, the bill providing for the issuance of the gold dollar and double eagle passed both houses by large margins, and was signed into law by President James K. Polk on March 3, 1849. According to numismatist David Lange, \\"the double eagle was a banker's coin intended to simplify transfers of large sums between financial institutions and between nations\\".  Preparation  The act authorizing the gold dollar and double eagle precipitated conflict at the Philadelphia Mint. There the officers, including Chief Coiner Franklin Peale, were mostly the friends and relations of Director Patterson. The outsider in their midst was Chief Engraver James B. Longacre, successor to Gobrecht (who had died in 1844). A former copper-plate engraver, Longacre had been appointed through the political influence of South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. Patterson despised Calhoun, and Longacre became a loner at the mint. Most of Peale's formal duties were performed by his predecessor, Adam Eckfeldt, who continued to do the work of chief coiner despite his retirement. Peale spent the resulting free time running a private medal business taking commissions from the public and using the government's facilities, including its Contamin portrait lathe. This machine, used in Peale's medal work, was needed to reduce models of new designs to coin-sized reductions from which working dies could be made. So long as no new coin designs were needed, dies could be reproduced mechanically, without using the Contamin device. Although it belonged to his department, Longacre did not use the Contamin lathe much until Congress ordered that the two new coins be struck. When Longacre began work on the two new coins in early 1849, he had no assistants. He completed work on the gold dollar first, anxious to show that he could create a coin design. In May, he requested that Patterson hire another engraver to assist him. The director declined, willing only to have engraving work contracted out. This was unsatisfactory to Longacre, who was responsible under the law for the proper execution of coinage dies, and who could not supervise outside work. As Longacre worked on the double eagle design, according to numismatist Walter Breen, \\"Peale, with Patterson's tacit approval, began harassment.\\" Longacre prepared a large model of the new coin in wax and was instructed to give it to Peale for use in preparing a metal galvano, which could be used in the lathe. The operation failed, and Longacre's model was destroyed. Longacre had, however, made a cast of his model in plaster, and was able to use it in the machine. The resulting steel die had to be hardened in Peale's department; as Longacre put it, \\"it unluckily split in the process\\". According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, \\"Peale's adoption of a process not normally used at the Mint, together with its catastrophic failures, seems more than coincidental\\". Longacre set forth on a third attempt to create a die. He was hampered not only by the continued opposition of Peale but by poor lighting and the noxious fumes that penetrated his office at the Philadelphia Mint. A friend, New York engraver Charles Cushing Wright, arranged for Peter F. Cross to assist Longacre with making hubs and dies. Cross made the first obverse die in November and December 1849 at Longacre's direction, and the chief engraver made the reverse. On December 22, 1849, Patterson wrote to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that the dies were completed. He enclosed a double eagle, asking Meredith, if he approved of the piece, to send word as quickly as possible to allow the coinage of 1849 double eagles in quantity. Before any reply could be received, Peale objected on December 24, complaining that the relief of the head of Liberty was so high that pieces struck using the Philadelphia Mint's steam- powered machinery could not fully bring out the design‚Äîthe coin sent to Meredith had been coined on a medal press, by hand. In addition, Peale alleged that the head was in such high relief that the coins would not stack. Patterson sent Peale's letter to Meredith on December 25, noting that this meant there would be a lengthy delay. Longacre completed the lower-relief dies about January 12, 1850. Peale did not test them for two weeks; when he did, he rejected them, stating that Liberty's head opposed the eagle on the reverse, making it difficult for the full design to be brought forth. He stated that Longacre would have to move the position of the head. Longacre, outraged, appealed to Director Patterson, who took no action, but early the next month came to see Longacre in his office. He told the engraver that the Taylor administration (which had taken office in March 1849) had decided on Longacre's removal, and urged him to send in his resignation as quickly as possible. Longacre did not resign but went to Washington to see Secretary Meredith. He found that Patterson had lied to Meredith about a number of matters. For example, when Longacre took a new double eagle from his pocket, Meredith expressed surprise, believing that the dies from which it had been made had been broken. Longacre kept his job. According to numismatic author Q. David Bowers, Longacre's last set of dies were completed in February 1850, and were accepted. Breen, however, stated that the first production coins appeared about January 26, 1850. Only one 1849 double eagle is known to be extant; it forms part of the Smithsonian Institution's National Numismatic Collection. The specimen sent to Meredith is unlocated, and is said to have been owned in the 1950s by coin dealer William K. Nagy, whose former business partner John W. Haseltine supposedly acquired it from the Meredith estate. Nagy allegedly stated that he had sold the coin to a private collector. One 1849 piece, in gilt brass, was later struck for Philadelphia druggist and numismatist Robert Coulton Davis, who had close ties to the Mint. Its location is also unknown.  Design  The obverse depicts a head of Liberty in the Greco-Roman style, facing left, with her hair pulled back‚Äîaccording to numismatists Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, \\"attractively\\"‚Äîin a bun. Some of her hair descends the back of her neck. She wears a coronet, inscribed \\"Liberty\\", and is surrounded by thirteen stars, representative of the original states, and the year of issue. The reverse features a heraldic eagle, holding a double ribbon, on which \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" is inscribed. The double ribbon is an allusion by Longacre to the denomination of the piece he was designing. The design is a variant on the Great Seal of the United States; the eagle protects a shield, which represents the nation, and holds an olive branch and arrows. Above the bird, Longacre again placed thirteen stars, arranged as a halo, together with an arc of rays. Longacre's initials, JBL, appear on the truncation of the head. The gold dollar and twenty-dollar piece were the first American federal coins on which the designer's initials appear‚Äîon the gold dollar, only the \\"L\\" is used. Longacre's designs for the double eagle and the Type I gold dollar (1849‚Äì1854) are similar. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule disliked the double eagle and other Longacre coins showing Liberty, calling them routine. He did find that the reverse \\"has some commendable points of heraldic imagery\\" and likened that side of the coin to \\"the frontispiece for a patriotic brochure\\". The Daily Alta California in May 1850 reprinted a piece from an unnamed Eastern newspaper, which said of the new piece, \\"we cannot say that we admire it ... [the eagle on the reverse is] imperfectly formed, and marred by some adjacent flummery intended for radiance we suppose, by which the whole thing is rendered confused\\". The Journal of Commerce, a New York periodical, suggested that the piece be replaced with one showing George Washington on one side and on the other \\"a handsome eagle standing out as if it were not ashamed of itself\\". The Boston Evening Transcript suggested that Mint authorities should be \\"stopping the issuance of this very shabby coin. The manager of the mint would seem to be utterly destitute of taste to allow such a specimen to go forth.\\" Bowers, writing in 2004, stated that despite the negative contemporary reaction, the design of the double eagle is now very popular among collectors.  Production  = Type I (1850‚Äì1866) = The double eagle soon became the most popular gold coin in terms of the number of pieces struck. During the denomination's life, from 1850 to 1933, far more gold was struck into double eagles than into all other denominations combined. Of all gold coins struck from the start of gold coinage for circulation in 1795 to the end in 1933, just under half of the coins struck were double eagles, but 78% of the gold used was struck into twenty-dollar pieces. According to Bowers, the double eagle \\"represented the most efficient way to coin a given quantity of gold bullion into coin form\\". Regular production of the double eagle began with the striking of just over a million at Philadelphia in 1850, and 141,000 at the New Orleans Mint that year. Double eagles were struck at New Orleans every year from 1850 to 1861, generally in small quantities. In the early years of the Liberty Head double eagle, when no mint was in the Far West, some California gold was presented there for coining into double eagles. Once the San Francisco Mint opened in 1854, New Orleans mintages were light as for the most part only local gold was deposited, and there was not much of it. The Philadelphia Mint continued to receive much of the California gold. After Louisiana seceded from the Union in 1861, some of the double eagles from New Orleans that year, though bearing the standard designs, were struck under the authority of the State of Louisiana, and later, the Confederacy. That mint then closed, reopening in 1879. The branch mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, which also closed with the Civil War, had limited coinage facilities, and struck no denomination higher than a half eagle. A shortage of gold coins occurred in California and the Far West in the early 1850s; federal authorities refused to accept gold dust for payment of customs duties and private minters soon stepped into the breach. California Senator William Gwin proposed legislation to establish assay offices in California and for the issuance of high-denomination gold coins, as large as $10,000. Although most of his proposals were defeated, an assay office was established at San Francisco. Nevertheless, two waves of panic related to money roiled California, and in 1852, Congress established the San Francisco Mint. The first double eagle was coined there on April 3, 1854; struck in proof condition, that piece is now part of the National Numismatic Collection. Just over half of the double eagles struck between 1850 and 1933 were minted at San Francisco. Many of the high-grade San Francisco Type I double eagles known today were taken from shipwrecks, where they had rested for over a century. These ships included the SS Brother Jonathan, the SS Central America, and the SS Yankee Blade. Thousands of almost-pristine 1857 double eagles struck at San Francisco (1857-S) went down with the Central America when it sank off the East Coast of the United States that September, as did some 435 people, including Captain William Herndon. The cargo was salvaged beginning in the 1980s; once litigation over its ownership was settled, the pieces were marketed to the public. The Brother Jonathan, a luxurious paddle steamer en route from San Francisco north to Portland, sank in July 1865; few survived the wreck. The thousands of double eagles and other coins on board were salvaged beginning in 1996, and once litigation concluded, many mint state double eagles came on the market. The 1861 Paquet reverse The word \\"LIBERTY\\" on double eagles between 1850 and 1858 was originally spelled \\"LLBERTY\\" by Longacre, who converted the second L into an I; this is visible under magnification. In 1860, Assistant Engraver Anthony C. Paquet completed a revision of the reverse, with taller, narrower letters. After production had begun in early 1861 at Philadelphia and San Francisco, it was noticed that the design lacked a rim high enough to protect the design from abrasion, and the Mint went back to the old reverse. Only a handful of the Philadelphia specimens were not melted, but by the time word reached San Francisco to stop production, the western mint had issued 20,000 pieces. A Philadelphia specimen sold at auction for $1,610,000 in August 2006, setting a record for the Liberty Head double eagle series. In February 2013, an 1866-S double eagle with no motto was discovered in the Saddle Ridge Hoard in the Gold Country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California. Only a very small number of proof coins in the Liberty Head double eagle series were struck for sale to the public, beginning in 1858, at Philadelphia; Breen noted, \\"few collectors could afford them even then\\". = Type II (1866‚Äì1876) = With the nation in the midst of an internal war, in November 1861, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase received a proposal that American coinage bear an expression of faith in God. After various wordings were considered, \\"In God We Trust\\" was placed on the new two-cent piece in 1864. The Act of March 3, 1865, that authorized the copper-nickel three-cent piece also required the motto to appear on all coins large enough to bear it. Pursuant to this mandate, Longacre began re-engraving the various denominations of U.S. coinage. In 1866, he added \\"In God We Trust\\" to all coins that did not already have it, excepting the pieces smaller in diameter than the nickel, a coin which began to be struck that year. The San Francisco Mint used up leftover double eagle reverse dies from 1865 before switching over during 1866. Longacre made the required addition to the double eagle by slightly enlarging the circle of stars on the reverse, and placing the motto within it. He took the opportunity to make other changes to the double eagle. The shield on the reverse was given rococo sides; previously they had been straight. A ninth leaf was added to the olive branch, and the shape of the leaves was changed. The finials of the scroll were made smaller though more elaborate‚Äîon the left-hand scroll, the finials impinge less on the letters \\"ibus\\" in \\"Pluribus\\" than before. The eagle's wings and tail feathers were also slightly elongated. In 1870, the Carson City Mint opened in Nevada at the urging of silver mining interests, so that ore could be refined and converted to coin locally. In addition to silver, it struck gold half eagles, eagles, and double eagles. The 1870-CC double eagle, like other coins from that mint's first year of operations, is a great rarity‚Äîonly 3,789 were struck. One sold for $414,000 at auction in March 2009. Carson City double eagles circulated for the most part only locally, since they were only struck in response to the deposit of gold bullion and the request of the depositor that it be coined into twenty-dollar pieces. Heavy production of the coin occurred in San Francisco and satisfied the needs of Californians and those in the export trade. As gold did not circulate in the East, most Philadelphia pieces of this era were either sent west, or exported and melted. In November 1872, Chief Engraver William Barber, Longacre's successor, submitted a set of logotypes to show how the following year's date would appear on the coinage. They were approved, but on January 18, 1873, Chief Coiner A. Loudon Snowden filed a written complaint, stating that the \\"3\\" in the date too closely resembled an \\"8\\". Barber was ordered to redo his work; this decision affected most denominations of U.S. coins. The differences between the \\"Closed 3\\" and \\"Open 3\\" on the double eagle are small. One difference is that on the Closed 3, the two knobs on the \\"3\\" are equal in size; on the Open 3, the upper one is somewhat smaller. All Carson City and most San Francisco issues from that year are Closed 3. = Type III (1877‚Äì1907) = Obverse of 1904 double eagle. William Barber's modifications left more room for the date. In 1876, William Barber altered the double eagle's reverse, emboldening \\"In God We Trust\\". The two varieties are known as the \\"Heavy Motto\\" and \\"Light Motto\\" types. He made more extensive changes for the following year's production. He truncated Liberty's neck at a sharper angle to allow more space for the date, which was punched into the dies by hand. In Longacre's original version, the tip of Liberty's coronet is very close to the seventh star clockwise from the date; beginning in 1877, it points between the sixth and seventh stars. A more noticeable change was made to the reverse, where the denomination, formerly \\"Twenty D.\\", was spelled out as \\"Twenty Dollars\\". The phrase \\"E Pluribus Unum\\", on the ribbon that the eagle bears, was enlarged. The new dies initially created difficulties at the Mint and Barber made minor adjustments to the design over the first few months of production. Many double eagles were struck at San Francisco between 1877 and 1883. Beginning in 1881, mintage of double eagles at Philadelphia was sharply curtailed. For the seven years 1881‚Äì1887, only 4,521 were made at that mint for circulation, none being struck in 1882, 1883, and 1887. They were struck yearly in proof at Philadelphia: the 1883 (mintage 92), 1884 (71) and 1887 (121) are great rarities. The mintage of 2,325 at New Orleans in 1879, the only postwar strikings there, is unexplained‚ÄîBreen suggested that the local mint superintendent might have anticipated demand for the denomination. Double eagles were unpopular in commerce in the South, as were eagles. Millions of double eagles were sent to Europe as payment in international transactions beginning in the 1880s, often in cloth bags containing 250 coins, for a total of $5,000 per bag. Puck magazine shows the gold standard, represented by the double eagle, triumphant over the silver. In 1900, William Barber's successor as chief engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins about that time suggest that he most likely did it as part of a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco‚Äîhighs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928. The 1891 discovery of gold at Cripple Creek, Colorado, in 1891 led to a gold rush there. The greater availability of gold in Colorado was one reason the Denver Mint was authorized in 1904‚Äîit opened in 1906. About a dozen proofs were struck for presentation to dignitaries when production of double eagles was inaugurated at Denver on April 4, 1906. = Replacement = In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt complained to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie M. Shaw, about the designs on American coinage, and enquired if a sculptor such as the President's friend, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, could be hired to provide beautiful, up-to-date designs. The following year, the Mint hired Saint-Gaudens to create new designs for the four gold pieces then being struck, as well as the cent. Other commissions delayed him, and as he became more ill with the cancer that would kill him, his work slowed. Chief Engraver Barber repeatedly objected to the design Saint-Gaudens finally submitted, which shows Liberty striding across a rocky outcrop, on the grounds that its relief was too high. After Saint-Gaudens's death on August 3, 1907, Barber produced his own, low-relief version of Saint- Gaudens's coin. Its striking began in late 1907, and it entered commerce that December‚Äîthereby putting an end to the Liberty Head double eagle series.  Collecting  Large quantities of double eagles were melted in the 1930s by the government after they were called in under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although many of the double eagles exported in bulk in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were melted‚Äîrecords show that most sent to the United Kingdom were recoined into sovereigns‚Äîmillions remained in banks. Large quantities of double eagles were found in the vaults of European banks beginning in the 1940s, and were placed on the numismatic market. Many common and low-grade Liberty Head double eagles have been sold as investments, valued based on their bullion content. Type I double eagles have been recovered from shipwrecks, bringing many high-grade early specimens onto the market, with the romance of \\"treasure coins\\" increasing the public demand. In the 19th century, double eagles were little collected. Numismatists did not yet consider mint- marked coins to be distinct from those without. Even proof coins‚Äîwith mintages in the dozens or low hundreds‚Äîsold on the secondary market at a slight increase from face value, and probably many were spent in hard times. In 1909, early numismatic writer Edgar H. Adams published a catalog of American gold issues. No Liberty Head double eagle was considered by Adams to be worth more than the value inscribed on it. As it became clear in the 1940s that the withdrawal of gold coins in 1933 had left several late-date Saint-Gaudens double eagles unexpectedly rare, collector interest grew in the denomination. The massive importation of double eagles held overseas once Americans were allowed to own gold again in 1974 added to the supply, but according to numismatic writer and coin dealer Bowers, \\"today they are of such wide popularity, fascination, and interest that the record prices achieved [at an important sale in 1949] seem like incredible bargains!\\" There are many ways to collect Liberty Head double eagles. Some, wishing only a few pieces, may choose one each of the three major types, or seek pieces from the five mints that struck them. Carson City double eagles are highly popular. As the 1870-CC is almost unobtainable, collectors may limit themselves to Carson City Type III pieces (1877‚Äì1893). Collectors seeking one double eagle per year of mintage will find it expensive to fill the 1886 entry, a year in which double eagles were only struck at Philadelphia, and just 1,000 business strikes and 106 proof pieces were issued. The 2015 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1886 in Very Fine condition (VF-20) at $22,500.

To qualify for government land grants, the company was supposed to build a wagon road from The Dalles, Oregon, to Fort Boise in Idaho. However, the company's road, on which it spent about $6,000 and for which it received nearly of public land, consisted largely of existing wagon roads and rudimentary trails. In particular, the company took credit for building a well-traveled and pre-existing wagon road between The Dalles and Canyon City, Oregon. The company also built a road from Canyon City to the Oregon-Idaho border near Vale, Oregon. The claims of a good wagon road were greatly exaggerated. These claims involved not only the company but Oregon officials, including the governor. The road was used by wagons pulled by oxen or mules to haul food and other supplies to military forts and stations spaced every 30 miles or so along the route. In 1990, it was still possible to travel nearly the entire length from Canyon City to near Brogan, Oregon, where the route becomes U.S. Route 26, in a stout 4 wheel drive, high clearance vehicle. The visible traces show the hurried building and poor planning. Steep grades, large rocks, poor water control, and swampy areas all contributed to a rough trail. Most of the road is still used by ranchers, fishermen, and hunters. However, modern 4 wheel drive vehicles are much better suited to the rocky climbs and dry stretches . Not much is left of any of the forts east of Canyon City. After the need for the road diminished and then numerous lawsuits, the company went bankrupt and abandoned it to the elements. Public discontent with the fraud, the road, the land grants, and the way the grant lands were re-sold and managed led to a federal lawsuit about 20 years later. In the suit, the U.S. Attorney General argued that the land had been privatized through fraud and should be returned to the public domain. The suit was dismissed in 1893, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with lower courts that since Oregon's governor had certified the road as authentic and complete in 1870, the grants were valid and could not be reversed. Route In general, the road followed existing trails and roads, linking The Dalles to Fort Boise. Between the endpoints, the main route passed through or near places such as Antelope, Mitchell, Dayville, Canyon City, Brogan, and Vale, Oregon. The fraction of the route used by a stage line that began operation in 1864, is referred to simply as The Dalles ‚Äì Canyon City Wagon Road in the Dictionary of Oregon History which says \\"numerous freight wagons, pack trains and tramping feet of miners moving to and from the John Day Valley, gradually hammered it into a fairly good road.\\" Points along the road included Sherars Bridge, Burnt Ranch, Antone, and Braggs Ranch, in addition to Mitchell and the end points. The continuation of the wagon road for which The Dalles Military Road Company claimed credit is shown on an Atlas of Oregon map angling east and southeast from Canyon City, hitting as averred in a later court case about The Dalles Military Road, \\"the maps or plats referred to in the certificate of the governor showed the line of the pretended road to be \\" long. An article in The New York Times in 1888 cited a letter from William Vilas, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, who said in part: History The route of The Dalles Military Road generally followed Native American trails that were later used by white explorers such as Peter Skene Ogden and John Work on their travels through northeastern Oregon in the 1820s and early 1830s. In 1860, soldiers led by Enoch Steen developed a military wagon road from Fort Harney, near what later became Burns, to The Dalles. In 1862, more than 1,000 miners entered the region after gold was discovered on Canyon Creek, a tributary of the John Day River. Many of them traveled from the Willamette Valley and Portland to The Dalles, where they followed established routes, including Steen's, to the John Day Valley west of what became Dayville and upstream to Canyon Creek. By 1864, the route was further improved, and mail, supplies, and passengers regularly traveled from The Dalles to Canyon City and the mines. To protect miners and other whites from the native peoples, who had not yet ceded this territory, the Federal government established military forts along the route. As early as the 1850s, the United States Congress had been giving land to private companies to induce them to build railroads and wagon roads across the West. In the case of what Congress referred to as \\"military wagon roads\\", a legal fiction since most were rarely used by the military, land ownership in Oregon was greatly affected. Land grants for the five military wagon roads in the state totaled almost , whereas the total for all other states combined was about . The other four roads were the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road from Springfield to Fort Boise, authorized in 1865; the Corvallis-Yaquina Bay Military Wagon Road, from Corvallis to Yaquina City (1866); the Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountain Military Wagon Road from Albany to Fort Boise (1866), and the Coos Bay Military Wagon Road from Roseburg to Coos Bay (1869). The Dalles - Fort Boise Military Road was authorized in 1867. Of these five, all but the Corvallis-Yaquina City road are considered to have been \\"almost total frauds\\" involving \\"local speculators\\" aided by \\"the connivance of state officials\\". Under the rules set by Congress, the land grants in Oregon passed to the state. When a private company completed part of the road, it could petition the Oregon governor to award the company 3 square-mile sections of land for every of finished road. The private company was then free to sell or lease the land. In general, investors in the military roads chose routes through the most valuable land, such as potential farmland along rivers. A group of businessmen, mainly from The Dalles and doing business as The Dalles Military Road Company, chose the well-established route from The Dalles to Canyon City via the John Day River valley and from there to Fort Boise. The Oregon Legislature awarded the work to the company in late 1868. Governor George L. Woods certified completion of the first in mid-1869 and completion of the entire route in early 1870. In part, the governor said, \\"I further certify that I have made a careful examination of said road since its completion, and that the same is built in all respects as required ... and that said road is accepted.\\" Congress approved the land transfers in 1874, and in 1876 The Dalles Military Road Company sold the land to Edward Martin of San Francisco for $125,000 (equivalent to $ today). Martin's Eastern Oregon Land Company acquired in sections within of either side of the road. Legal challenge Public discontent about the privatized land, its high resale price, the lack of road maintenance, and private restrictions on land use and the road itself mounted during subsequent years. In 1885, the Oregon Legislature asked Congress to investigate the original land grant for possible fraud. Subsequently, the U.S. Attorney General filed a bill in equity aimed at forcing The Dalles Military Road Company, the Eastern Oregon Land Company, and other defendants to return the grant lands to the public domain. In 1893, the U.S. Supreme Court, rejecting the Attorney General's arguments, agreed with lower courts that the validity of the land grant was established when Governor Woods certified the road, and the case was dismissed. In 1904, the Eastern Oregon Land Company offered to sell some of its grant lands in Sherman County, to the Federal government. The land company asked for $60 an acre for batches of quarter section lots totaling no less than per batch; that is, $600,000 per batch.

During his mayoralty, he fought and was instrumental in making Baton Rouge the state capital again. He was a co-founder of the United Confederate Veterans. He wrote political articles as a newspaper editor, including an editorial noted for its advocacy of racial segregation. Early life Leon Jastremski was born to an aristocratic family in Soulon, France. His father, Vincent Jastremski, was a Polish Jewish emigre, where he had studied medicine and married before moving with his family to Louisiana. Jastremski was born in the castle of Count de Pontaut. Jastremski's parents and siblings left for the United States, while he was under the care of his mother's relatives until six. He went to the United States in 1852 or 1853, joining his family. Both of his parents died in 1856, leaving him an orphan. After their deaths, he worked as a printer's apprentice. American Civil War During the Civil War, he served as a private in the 10th Louisiana Infantry Regiment and for a time was with Col. Walerian Su≈Çakowski's brigade in Virginia. He fought against the Union at the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1, 1862 and was captured and imprisoned at Fort Delaware. After he was released, he fought at the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Second Battle of Bull Run, Battle of Chantilly, Battle of Harpers Ferry, and Battle of Antietam. He rose to the ranks of captain and was captured for a third time at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 12, 1864. He was wounded twice during his service in the Confederate Army, once in the throat and another in the hand. At one time during the war, his brigade was in battle against a Union brigade led by another Polish exile, W≈Çodzimierz Krzy≈ºanowski. Jastremski was a founding member of the United Confederate Veterans, created in 1889. He suggested creating it after attending a meeting of the Grand Army of the Republic. Political career After the war he moved to Baton Rouge to work at his brother's drug store. In 1876 he was elected mayor of Baton Rouge with the support of former members of the Knights of the White Camelia. As mayor he was instrumental in restoring Baton Rouge as the state capital, and was re- elected twice. Jastremski elected chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee, and led Grover Cleveland's presidential campaign in Louisiana. He was U.S. consul to Peru from 1893 to 1897, was appointed state commissioner of agriculture, and later served as a private secretary to the governor. Historian Donald Everett noted that Jastremski, despite his place in important leadership roles, never \\"received more than superficial attention\\". He ran for governor in 1904 without success but died before the 1908 gubernatorial election, which he also campaigned for, could be held. Historian James S. Pula suggests that racist ideology and white southern populism were likely used in his campaign platforms. Personal life and death Jastremski married Rose Larguier on July 1, 1867. He attended church at the church that would later become St. Joseph Cathedral. Despite his Polish name and ethnic background, he was born in France and wrote to his own family in French. In his biography Pills, Pens, & Politics, Edward Pinkowski found numerous Polish immigrants in Baton Rouge existed during his time, but there is no convincing proof that he was friends with them or took a paternalistic attitude towards them as mayor. Jastremski's documents and letters are held at Louisiana State University. Jastremski died on November 29, 1907. References * Pula, James.

Production The showrunners for the season were John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky.https://www.macleans.ca/authors/jaime- weinman/a-koth-kronology/ Beginning with the episode \\"Lucky See, Monkey Do\\", King of the Hill started being produced in 720p 16:9 high-definition. 20th Century Fox Television initially ordered 13 DABE production episodes, but decided to keep the show in production for four additional episodes (DABE14‚ÄìDABE17). Because Fox wanted to make room for new shows on their \\"Animation Domination\\" line-up, the final six DABE episodes were cut down to two (\\"The Boy Can't Help It\\" and \\"To Sirloin with Love\\"). Both episodes aired as a special one-hour series finale on September 13, 2009. The other four unaired episodes (\\"The Honeymooners,\\" \\"Bill Gathers Moss,\\" \\"When Joseph Met Lori, and Made Out with Her in the Janitor's Closet,\\" and \\"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\\") did not air on Fox, but did appear in syndicated reruns and on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim line-up, as well as appearing on streaming platforms Netflix and Amazon Prime. \\"To Sirloin with Love\\" is still considered by many to be the final episode of the series, despite not being the last episode to air, as it was the last episode produced and written for the series. Despite being the final season of the series, during the panel discussion for the return of Beavis and Butt-head (another Mike Judge's TV show) at Comic-Con 2011, Judge said that although no current plans exist to revive King of the Hill, he would not rule out the possibility of it returning.

Founded in 1919 as the successor to the pre-World War I Gerlach i Pulst company, Fabryka Karabin√≥w became part of the state- owned Pa≈Ñstwowe Wytw√≥rnie Uzbrojenia conglomerate in 1927. It was a sister company to ≈Åucznik Arms Factory, the Munitions Factory of Skar≈ºysko, and several others. By the end of the 1930s, Fabryka Karabin√≥w was one of the largest arms producers of Poland. It was destroyed during World War II.  History  The company was started in the mid-19th century by Wilhelm Gerlach, one of the heirs of the Gerlach family of entrepreneurs, owners of ‚Äì among others ‚Äì the largest cutlery factory in Poland. By 1886 the small workshop at Srebrna Street in Warsaw was inherited by Wilhelm's son, Maksymilian Gerlach. In 1897 the factory was turned into a joint company owned by Gerlach and a new associate, Edward Pulst, who became the factory's chief engineer and technical director. In the following year, the factory was renamed to Sp√≥≈Çka Akcyjna Fabryki Maszyn \\"Gerlach i Pulst\\" ‚Äì \\"Gerlach and Pulst\\" Joint Stock Machinery Factory. In 1900 the company was moved to new premises at Dworska 2 Street in Warsaw. The \\"Gerlach i Pulst\\" produced machine tools, turneries, planers, drilling machines, presses, saws and many other types of machinery, used notably in small arms production. By the start of World War I the company had 750 employees and owned a \\"Gerlach & Co.\\" machinery shop at Krucza 24 Street in down-town Warsaw. Following the start of the Great War, in 1915 most of company's assets were dismantled by the retreating Russians and sent by rail to other parts of Russia. After the Great Retreat, the factory was taken over by the German Army who set up an arms repair workshop there. When Poland regained independence in 1919 the workshops were nationalised by the Ministry of Military Affairs along with all the remaining assets of the former Gerlach i Pulst company. Already in early 1919 the small-arms repair workshops were operational again. Reinforced with machines acquired from the former German Royal Arms Factory of Danzig and spare parts purchased in Germany, the workshops initially provided repair services to the Polish Army's units equipped with Mauser rifles. However, already in 1920 they were renamed to \\"State Rifle Factory\\" and in 1922 the company started producing rifles as well. By 1923 mass production started and by the end of the following year the factory delivered 21,900 Mauser wz. 1898 rifles to the Polish Army. In the following year, a modified version, the Kbk wz. 1929, entered production. Production lasted until 1931 and amounted to 189,600 pieces. Since 1928, the company was the sole producer of Browning wz.1928 light machine gun. In 1930 it also started licensed production of Ckm wz.30 heavy machine guns. After that the production of rifles was moved to Radom-based Fabryka Broni, while the FK focused on more complicated designs. By the end of the 1930s the Fabryka Karabin√≥w was one of the largest arms producers of Poland, with production capabilities far exceeding potential orders from the army. For example, in 1938 the company's CEO estimated that the factory could produce 600 pieces of Browning wz.1928 LMG each month, while the total orders for that year amounted to only 900 pieces. By the outbreak of World War II the company produced 10,700 LMGs and 7861 HMGs, as well as a small batch of 30,000 Nagant M1895 revolvers for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The company also designed and produced numerous aerial weapons. The first was the Karabin maszynowy wz. 33, a 7.92√ó57mm Mauser calibre aerial version of the Ckm wz.30 multi-purpose HMG. It was further modified as the Karabin maszynowy wz. 36. Another successful design was the Karabin maszynowy obserwatora wz.37, based on the Browning wz.1928. One of the most advanced designs produced at FK was the Nkm wz.38 FK auto-cannon. Other modern designs included an experimental pre-production series of around 50 pistolet maszynowy wz.39 Mors sub-machine guns and the highly-successful kb p-panc wz.35 anti-tank rifle (up to 6000 delivered). Introduction of further advanced designs was hampered by the outbreak of World War II and the start of the German occupation of Poland. During the final months of World War II the factory's equipment was seized by the Germans and sent to Germany, while most of the buildings were demolished. After the war, in 1948 it was rebuilt as Fabryka Wyrob√≥w Precyzyjnych im. gen. ≈öwierczewskiego (General ≈öwierczewski Precision Machinery Factory). Renamed as VIS after 1989, the company ceased production and sold off its assets. By 2008 all of the remaining buildings had been demolished to make way for a new residential district.

The original building was constructed in 1909, and a major expansion was added in 1960.

Initial estimates for the work were $3.5 million, however unexpected construction problems raised the final cost to $9.1 million. The new Springfield Arts Center opened to the public on December 31, 2003. In 2004, Family Video CEO Charles Hoogland and his wife Kay made a major donation and, in recognition, the center changed its name.

The type and only species, Megaconus mammaliaformis (nicknamed Jurassic Squirrel), was first described in the journal Nature in 2013. Megaconus is thought to have been a herbivore that lived on the ground, having a similar posture to modern-day armadillos and rock hyraxes. Megaconus is a member of a group called Haramiyida. A phylogenetic analysis published along with its first description showed that haramiyidans originated before the appearance of true mammals, but an accompanying description of the haramiyidan Arboroharamiya in the same issue of Nature indicated that haramyidans were true mammals. If haramiyidans are not mammals, Megaconus would be one of the most basal (\\"primitive\\") mammaliaforms to possess fur, and an indicator that fur evolved in the ancestors of mammals and not the mammals themselves. Description Megaconus is one of the few early mammaliaforms known from a complete skeleton. The skeleton includes both the jaw bones and the teeth, which are the most informative features because they allow for comparisons with other mammaliaforms known only from dental features. Megaconus has a dentition similar to those of rodents, with large incisors at the front of the jaws and broad molars in the back. One distinguishing feature of Megaconus is a pair of enlarged premolar teeth in the lower jaw. The teeth of Megaconus have many cusps, allowing them to interlock tightly when the jaws are closed. If Megaconus is a non-mammalian mammaliaform, it is one of the most basal mammaliaforms to possess such complex teeth. The middle ear of Megaconus is more primitive than that of modern mammals. The three bones that make up the middle ear in modern mammals ‚Äî the malleus, incus, and stapes ‚Äî originated from the lower jaw in the ancestors of mammals. In Megaconus, these bones are still associated with the lower jaw, placed within a groove behind the dentary bone of the lower jaw. Megaconus is estimated to have weighed about . It probably had an outwardly similar appearance to multituberculates, a major group of Mesozoic mammals. However, its body is longer than those of multituberculates and most other Mesozoic mammaliaforms, having more back vertebrae (24) than other early mammals. The transition between the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is more gradual in Megaconus than it is in multituberculates, and the boundary between the anterior and posterior epaxial muscles (the muscles that cover the front part and the back part of the back, respectively) is positioned farther back. Megaconus is inferred to have been ambulatory, meaning that it walked on the ground. Its claws are short, meaning that they were not suitable for digging, and only slightly curved, meaning that they were not suitable for climbing. The lack of an elongated calcaneus or \\"heel\\" on the ankle means that it could not have run fast. However, Megaconus differs from most ambulatory mammals in having a fused tibia and fibula in its lower leg, a feature that is normally seen in jumping or bipedal mammals. Among the only living ambulatory mammals to have a fused tibia and fibula are the armadillo and the aardvark. Remains of fur are preserved on parts of the skeleton. The fur consists of dark guard hairs and a lighter layer of underfur. Fur seems to be absent on the underside of the abdomen. A keratinous spur on the rear leg may have been used to deliver poison, like the spur of the living platypus. Discovery The holotype skeleton of Megaconus was discovered in the Daohugou Beds of the Tiaojishan Formation in Inner Mongolia, China. The layer in which Megaconus was found is about 165 million years old (Ma). In addition to Megaconus, several other mammaliaforms are known from the Daohugou Beds: the non-mammalian mammaliaform Castorocauda, the basal mammals Volaticotherium and Pseudotribos, and the placental mammal Juramaia. The genus name Megaconus means \\"large cusp\\", coming from the Latin mega (\\"large\\") and the Greek conus (\\"cusp\\"), in reference to the pair of large premolars in its lower jaw. The species name mammaliaformis references its ancestral mammalian features. Relationships Megaconus is part of the clade Haramiyida, which is otherwise known almost exclusively from teeth. The relationships of haramiyidans to other early mammals is contested. One idea is that haramiyidans are close relatives of Multituberculata, the most diverse group of Mesozoic mammals, and that both are part of the larger clade Allotheria. According to this evolutionary hypothesis (phylogeny), haramiyidans fall within the crown group Mammalia ‚Äî the clade originating from the most recent common ancestor of living mammals. Within the crown group Mammalia, Haramiyida would be a basal offshoot of Boreosphenida, the clade including marsupials, eutherians (placental mammals), and all mammals more closely related to them than to monotremes (which are part of the clade Australosphenida). A second hypothesis holds that haramiyidans originated before the appearance of crown group Mammalia as more basal members of the larger clade Mammaliaformes and that multituberculates are deeply nested within the crown group, splitting up Allotheria. This phylogeny was supported by the phylogenetic analysis that included Megaconus. Features of Megaconus that link it with basal mammaliaforms include a groove in the lower jaw holding the middle ear bones (in multituberculates and other true mammals, these bones are completely separated from the lower jaw) and a calcaneum or ankle bone that lacks an enlarged heel.

Arboroharamiya belongs to a group of mammaliaforms called Haramiyida. The type species Arboroharamiya jenkinsi was described in the journal Nature in 2013 alongside a description of the closely related haramiyidan Megaconus. Unlike Megaconus, which is thought to have been ground- dwelling, Arboroharamiya was arboreal. It has a long tail that might have been prehensile, and very long fingers. Based on the shape of its teeth, Arboroharamiya might have been an omnivore or a seed eater. Recent interpretations of its specimen suggest that it possessed patagia and was a glider. When Arboroharamiya was included in a phylogenetic analysis of early mammals and mammaliaforms, Haramiyida was found to be a group within Mammalia, the true mammals. However, Megaconus was included in a different phylogenetic analysis, and that analysis placed Haramiyida outside Mammalia as a more basal (\\"primitive\\") group of mammaliaforms. The classification of Arboroharamiya and other haramiyidans as true mammals fits with what most previous studies have found, but since Arboroharamiya and Megaconus were not included in the same phylogenetic analysis, their position within Mammaliaformes remains uncertain. Description Arboroharamiya is the largest known haramiyidan, estimated to have weighed about 354 g. It has several features in common with living mammals, including a lower jaw formed by a single bone, the dentary, and hands and feet that each have four fingers with three bones each and one finger with two bones. Arboroharamiya is unlike any modern mammal in having a lower jaw that can move up, down, and backward, but not forward. It has a rodent-like dentition with enlarged incisors and molars and no canines. A rodent-like dentition is also seen in Multituberculata, an early group of mammals that might be closely related to Arboroharamiya, but it probably evolved independently in Arboroharamiya. Relationships Arboroharamiya belongs to a clade or evolutionary grouping called Mammaliaformes, which includes mammals and their closest extinct relatives from the Triassic and Jurassic periods. Within Mammaliaformes, Arboroharamiya falls within the clade Haramiyida. Haramiyidans have been known since the 1840s, but only from fossilized teeth and a single partial lower jaw. However, several features of the teeth have shown for many years that haramiyidans are among the most basal of mammaliaforms. Recent phylogenetic analyses, or analyses of evolutionary relationships, differ on whether or not haramiyidans are true mammals in the crown group Mammalia (the clade including the most recent common ancestor of living mammals, and all its descendants). Some analyses place Haramiyida outside crown group Mammalia, meaning that they diverged from other mammaliaforms before the most recent common ancestor of living mammals appeared. Other analyses place Haramiyida within Mammalia as part of an extinct group of Mesozoic mammals called Allotheria, which also includes Multituberculata. When Arboroharamiya itself was incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis, Haramiyida fell within Allotheria as a group within Mammalia.

A farmer, healer, and midwife, she was accused by her neighbors of transforming herself into a cat, damaging crops, and causing the death of livestock. She was charged with witchcraft several times; at her trial in 1706, Sherwood was accused of bewitching her neighbor, Elizabeth Hill, causing Hill to miscarry. The court ordered that Sherwood's guilt or innocence be determined by ducking her in water. If she sank, she was innocent; if she did not, she was guilty. Sherwood floated to the surface and may have spent almost eight years in jail before being released. Sherwood lived in Pungo, Princess Anne County (today part of Virginia Beach), and married James Sherwood, a planter, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she was accused of casting a spell on a bull, resulting in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful and her husband had to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80. On July 10, 2006, the 300th anniversary of Sherwood's conviction, Governor Tim Kaine granted an informal pardon to \\"officially restore [her] good name\\", recognizing that she was wrongfully convicted. A statue depicting her was erected near Sentara Independence on Independence Boulevard in Virginia Beach, close to the site of the colonial courthouse where she was tried. She is sculpted alongside a raccoon, representing her love of animals, and carrying a basket containing garlic and rosemary, in recognition of her knowledge of herbal healing.  Family background  Sherwood was born in 1660 to John and Susan White. John White was a carpenter and farmer of Scottish descent; it is uncertain whether he was born in America. Susan was English by birth; their daughter Grace was born in Virginia, probably in Pungo. In April 1680 Grace White married a respected small-farm landowner, James Sherwood, in the Lynnhaven Parish Church. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. John White gave the Sherwoods of land when they married, and on his death in 1681 left them the remainder of his farm. The Sherwood family was poor, and lived in an area inhabited by small landowners or those with no land at all. In addition to farming, Grace Sherwood grew her own herbs, which she used to heal both people and animals. She also acted as a midwife. When James died in 1701, Grace inherited his property. She did not remarry. No drawings or paintings of Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing a sense of humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up in an effort to remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.  Witchcraft and Virginia  Asheville Bridge Creek, known as Muddy Creek when Grace Sherwood lived on its banks The existence of witches and demonic forces was taken for granted by the American colonists‚Äîwitchcraft was considered the work of the Devil. Colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior. As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the Jamestown colony, a grand jury in Virginia sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witch‚Äîshe had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record of the outcome is extant. Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience events of mass hysteria such as the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials in 1692‚Äì1693, in which 19 people were executed on allegations of sorcery, some years before the first accusations against Sherwood. Ecclesiastical influence in the courtroom was much less a factor in Virginia, where the clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials, than in New England, where ministers took an active part. People's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in folklore, although the two often intermingled. New England's Puritans had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, connected by water transport and scattered over a large area. Virginia's lay and religious leaders were more interested in prosecuting offenses such as gossip, slander, and fornication, seeing them as threats to social stability. They wished to avoid witchcraft prosecutions, which were divisive. Virginia courts were reluctant to hear accusations of witchcraft and were even more reluctant to convict. Unlike the Salem witch trial courts, where the accused had to prove her innocence, in Virginia courts the accuser carried the burden of proof. Further, Virginia courts generally ignored evidence said to have been obtained by supernatural means, whereas the New England courts were known to convict people based solely on it. Virginia required proof of guilt through either searches for witch's marks or ducking. Judges and magistrates would dismiss unsubstantiated cases of witchcraft and allow the accusers, who found themselves \\"under an ill tongue\\", to be sued for slander. Frances Pollard of the Virginia Historical Society states: \\"It was pretty clear that Virginia early on tried to discourage these charges being brought of witchcraft because they were so troublesome.\\" The southeastern corner of Virginia, around present-day Norfolk and Virginia Beach (where Pungo is located), saw more accusations of witchcraft than other areas. According to Leslie M. Newman, this may have been due to local poverty as there was no cultural elite to restrain such prosecutions. Although few Virginia records survive from that era, 19 known witchcraft cases were brought in the colony during the 17th century, all but one of which ended in acquittal. The one conviction was a 1656 case of a man convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to 10 stripes and banishment from the county. There were no executions for witchcraft in Virginia. Nonetheless, as late as in 1736, Virginia's justices of the peace were reminded that witchcraft was still a crime, and that first offenders could expect to be pilloried and jailed for up to a year. In 1745, John Craig, a Presbyterian minister in Augusta County, made assertions of witchcraft after his child and several of his animals died, and was in response accused of using evil arts to divine who was responsible. Neither he nor those who accused him brought their claims to court to face \\"unsympathetic magistrates\\", though prosecution for witchcraft was still possible in Virginia. The last Virginia witchcraft trial took place in 1802 in Brooke County, which is now in West Virginia. In that case, a couple claimed that a woman was a witch, an accusation ruled slanderous. The trial by ducking (immersing the accused, bound, in water, to see if she would float) appears to have been used only once in Virginia, to try Sherwood. It was believed that, as water was considered pure, it would reject witches, causing them to float, whereas the innocent would sink.  Accusations against Sherwood  = Initial claims of witchcraft = The first accusation against Sherwood came to court in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged that she had used a spell to cause the death of his bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs. According to Richard Beale Davis in his journal article on witchcraft in Virginia, by this time \\"Princess Anne County had obviously grown tired of Mrs. Sherwood as a general nuisance\\". In 1705, Sherwood was involved in a fight with her neighbor, Elizabeth Hill. Sherwood sued Hill and her husband for assault and battery, and on December 7, 1705, was awarded damages of twenty shillings (one pound sterling). = Trial by water = 17th-century engraving of ducking similar to that of Sherwood On January 3, 1706, the Hills accused Grace Sherwood of witchcraft. She failed to answer the charge in court, and on February 7, 1706, the court ordered her to appear on a charge of having bewitched Elizabeth Hill, causing a miscarriage. In March 1706 the Princess Anne County justices sought to empanel two juries, both made up of women. The first was ordered to search Sherwood's home for waxen or baked figures that might indicate she was a witch. The second was ordered to look for \\"demon suckling teats\\" by examining her. In both instances, reluctance on the part of the local residents made it difficult to form a jury and both juries refused to carry out the searches. On March 7, 1706, Sherwood was examined by a jury of 12 \\"ancient and knowing women\\" appointed to look for markings on her body that might be brands of the Devil. They discovered two \\"marks not like theirs or like those of any other woman\\". The forewoman of this jury was the same Elizabeth Barnes who had previously accused Sherwood of witchcraft. Neither the colonial authorities in Williamsburg nor the local court in Princess Anne were willing to declare Sherwood a witch. Those in Williamsburg considered the charge overly vague, and on April 16 instructed the local court to examine the case more fully. For each court appearance, Sherwood had to travel from her farm in Pungo to where the court was sitting. On May 2, 1706, the county justices noted that while no particular act of maleficium had been alleged against Sherwood, there was \\"great cause of suspicion\\". Consequently, the Sheriff of Princess Anne County took Sherwood into custody, though Sherwood could give bond for her appearance and good behavior. Maximilian Boush, a warden of Lynnhaven Parish Church, was the prosecutor in Sherwood's case. On July 5, 1706, the justices ordered a trial by ducking to take place, with Sherwood's consent, but heavy rains caused a postponement until July 10, as they feared the wet weather might harm her health. Sherwood was taken inside Lynnhaven Parish Church, placed on a stool and ordered to ask for forgiveness for her witchery. She replied, \\"I be not a witch, I be a healer.\\" Witch Duck Bay as seen from the very end of North Witchduck Road on Witch Duck Point in Virginia Beach, looking north. This is the place where Grace Sherwood was ducked. At about 10 a.m. on July 10, 1706, Sherwood was taken down a dirt lane now known as Witchduck Road, to a plantation near the mouth of the Lynnhaven River. News had spread, and the event attracted people from all over the colony, who began to shout \\"Duck the witch!\\" According to the principles of trial by water, if Sherwood floated she would be deemed guilty of witchcraft; if she did not, she would be innocent. It was not intended that Sherwood drown; the court had ordered that care be taken to preserve her life. Five women of Lynnhaven Parish Church examined Sherwood's naked body on the shoreline for any devices she might have to free herself, and then covered her with a sack. Six of the justices that had ordered the ducking rowed in one boat out in the river, and in another were the sheriff, the magistrate, and Sherwood. Just before she was pushed off the boat Sherwood is said to have stated, under clear skies, \\"Before this day be through you will all get a worse ducking than I.\\" Bound across the body‚Äîher right thumb to her left big toe and her left thumb to her right big toe ‚Äì she was \\"cast into the river\\", and quickly floated to the surface. The sheriff then tied a Bible around her neck. This caused her to sink, but she untied herself, and returned to the surface, convincing many spectators she was a witch. As Sherwood was pulled out of the water a downpour reportedly started, drenching the onlookers. Several women who subsequently examined her for additional proof found \\"two things like titts on her private parts of a black coller [color]\\". She was jailed pending further proceedings. = Aftermath = What happened to Sherwood after her ducking is unclear as many court records have been lost. She served an unknown time in the jail next to Lynnhaven Parish Church, perhaps as long as seven years and nine months. She was ordered to be detained \\"to be brought to a future trial\\", but no record of another trial exists, so it is possible the charge was dismissed at some point. On September 1, 1708, she was ordered to pay Christopher Cocke of tobacco for a reason not indicated in surviving records, but there is no mention of the payment. She appears to have been released some time in or before 1714, since in that year she paid back taxes on her property‚Äîwhich Virginia Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood helped her to recover from Princess Anne County‚Äîon the banks of Muddy Creek off what is now Muddy Creek Road. She lived the remainder of her life quietly until her death in 1740, aged about 80. She is believed to have died in August or September 1740. Her will was proved on October 1, 1740; it noted that she was a widow. She left five shillings each to her sons James and Richard and everything else to her eldest son John. According to legend, Sherwood's sons put her body near the fireplace, and a wind came down the chimney. Her body disappeared amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned several times in the 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.  Legacy  Street sign in the Witch Duck Point housing area of Virginia Beach. Many things are named \\"Witchduck\\" or \\"Witch Duck\\" in Virginia Beach, and both spellings are in use. Grace Sherwood's case was little known until Virginia Beach historian and author Louisa Venable Kyle wrote a children's book about her in 1973. Called The Witch of Pungo, it is a collection of seven local folk tales written as fiction, although based on historical events. Sherwood's story was adapted for Cry Witch, a courtroom drama at Colonial Williamsburg, the restored early capital of Virginia. A statue by California sculptor Robert Cunningham depicting Sherwood with a raccoon and a basket of rosemary was unveiled on April 21, 2007, on the site of the present-day Sentara Bayside Hospital, close to the sites of both the colonial courthouse and the ducking point. The raccoon represents Sherwood's love of animals and the rosemary her knowledge of herbal healing. A Virginia Department of Historic Resources marker (K-276) was erected in 2002, about from Sherwood's statue. The place of her watery test and the adjacent land are named Witch Duck Bay and Witch Duck Point. A portion of Virginia State Route 190 in Virginia Beach, a north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare on its western side which traverses Interstate 264 at exit numbers 14‚Äì16, has been named \\"Witchduck Road\\". Other commemorations in Virginia Beach include Sherwood Lane and Witch Point Trail. In 2014, a memorial marker was placed at a herb garden of the Old Donation Episcopal Church, Sherwood's former parish church, which is in Virginia Beach. A local legend in Virginia Beach states that all of the rosemary growing there came from a single plant Sherwood carried in an eggshell from England. Memorial marker for Sherwood Belinda Nash, in addition to writing a biography of Sherwood, worked tirelessly to get her pardoned. Governor Tim Kaine granted an informal pardon to \\"officially restore the good name of Grace Sherwood\\" on July 10, 2006, the 300th anniversary of her conviction. Annual reenactments of the ducking have taken place since 2006. No one is actually ducked in these events, which embark from a spot across from Ferry Plantation House along Cheswick Lane, which is very close to Witch Duck Bay. According to local residents, a strange moving light, said to be Sherwood's restless spirit, still appears each July over the spot in Witch Duck Bay where Sherwood was thrown into the water.

She served as the Secretary of State of West Virginia from 1957 to 1959 and also served in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1955 to 1957. Holt was the first woman to hold a statewide- office in the state of West Virginia. She later worked with the Federal Housing Administration and its successor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to improve long-term care facilities for the elderly. Helen Holt was married to Senator Rush Holt Sr. from 1941 until his death in 1955 and was the mother of New Jersey U.S. Representative Rush Holt Jr. Early life Holt was born Helen Louise Froelich on August 16, 1913 in rural Gridley, Illinois, the daughter of Gridley Mayor William E. and Edna M. (n√©e Gingerich) Froelich. Her parents were second generation immigrants from Germany. They were especially patriotic Americans, and her father served as mayor in their small town for more than 20 years. Holt was valedictorian of her high school and the only woman from her class who went on to college. She studied at Stephens College and the Marine Biological Laboratory before earning her bachelor's and master's degrees in zoology at Northwestern University. Holt was among just 4% of American women who completed a four-year college degree at that time. She taught biology at the National Park College in Forest Glen, Maryland and Greenbrier College for Women in Lewisburg, West Virginia. In 1940, Time magazine published a glamour shot of her in a spread about the country's prettiest school teachers. The photograph caught the attention of U.S. Senator Rush Holt, and the two were married in 1941. Following her marriage, she moved to Weston, West Virginia and became a close advisor to her husband as well as serving as an officer for the General Federation of Women's Clubs. Political career Following Rush's death from cancer in 1955, Helen was appointed by Governor William C. Marland to fill Rush's seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates. A Republican, she served the remaining two years of his term until choosing not to stand for reelection and instead to run as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. Holt continued to serve as a professor at Greenbrier until 1957 when she was appointed by Republican governor Cecil Underwood to serve as Secretary of State of West Virginia in 1957 following the death of Democrat Daniel Pitt O'Brien. Her appointment made her the first woman to hold a statewide-office in West Virginia. She was one of only 37 women to hold the office nationwide and just two other women from the Appalachian region (in Kentucky and Alabama) had female Secretaries of State during that time. She served until January 1959 when she was defeated in the November 1958 general election by Democrat Joe D. Burdett. After her defeat, Holt was appointed in 1959 to be Assistant Commissioner of Public Institutions, a position that oversaw women's prisons and nursing homes in the state. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, whom she had met while serving in the West Virginia State legislature, appointed Holt to the Federal Housing Administration as special assistant to the commissioner for a program overseeing nursing homes in 1960. In her role as special assistant, Holt helped to reform long-term care facilities and provided insured mortgages to build more than 1,000 nursing homes nationwide. Under seven different U.S. presidents, Holt worked to develop the expansive nursing home and housing system for the elderly that is still in use today. She served in the Federal Housing Administration's successor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development until the 1980s. While Holt did not consider herself a feminist and was critical of \\"women's lib,\\" she nevertheless served on the boards of various women's clubs and organizations, helped advance the careers of other women, and was a role model for women leaders. Personal life Holt married the former U.S. Senator Rush Holt Sr. on June 19, 1941. Rush was the youngest person ever elected to the Senate at the age of 29 in 1934. She remained married to him until his death from cancer on February 8, 1955. At the time of his death, Rush was serving in the first month of a term in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Holt has three children, including the Congressman from New Jersey's 12th congressional district, Rush Holt Jr.. Holt never remarried and in 2013, she was a resident of Washington, D.C.. She received an honorary degree from West Virginia University in 2013 and turned 100 in August of that year. Holt died in Boca Raton, Florida of heart failure on July 12, 2015, aged 101, a month shy of her 102nd birthday.

She saw service primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Brandon, Manitoba. Background Flower- class corvettes like Brandon serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Brandon was ordered 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down 10 October 1940 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched 29 April 1941. Brandon was commissioned at Quebec City on 22 July 1941. She had three refits during her career. The first took place at South Shields beginning in 1941 and taking three months to complete. The second refit took place at Grimsby in August 1943. The refit took three months to complete also and during this time, Brandon had her fo'c'sle extended. Her final refit took place at Liverpool in late 1944 and took two months to complete. War service Brandon arrived at Halifax on 1 August 1941. In September, she was assigned to Newfoundland Command. She served as an ocean escort until December of that year before heading in for a refit. After working up at Tobermory, the chief training base for UK escorts, Brandon returned to ocean escort duty. From mid-March 1942 until September 1944, Brandon was employed on the \\"Newfie\\" ‚Äì Derry route, escorting convoys from one side of the Atlantic to the other. Brandon picked up 45 men off the British merchant Broompark that had been torpedoed and damaged on 25 July 1942 by German U-boat U-552 east of Newfoundland, Canada. After saving her crew, the Broompark eventually sank under tow. In December 1942, she was assigned to Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-4. During her time with MOEF she took part in the battle for HX 224 in February 1943. In March, Brandon was temporarily assigned to escort convoys to Gibraltar. In August, she was sent in for another refit. On 2 September 1944, Brandon escorted her last trans-Atlantic convoy before going in for her final refit and then work ups in Bermuda.

Foundation During World War I (1914-1918) the Federal government took control of the railroads in the United States and encouraged railroad workers to organize. The Order of Sleeping Car Employees was established on 20 February 1918 in Kansas City, Missouri to undertake collective bargaining for wages and working conditions in the United States and Canada. At the first triennial convention in 1919 the name was changed to the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors. The union was headed by a president, with offices in Kansas City, Missouri. Members had to be white males, sober and industrious, sound in body and mind, and employed as a sleeping car or parlor car conductor for at least ten days before joining. History After the war the Pullman Company tried to establish an Employee Representation Plan (ERP) in the sleeping car service as an alternative to a union, although employees were rightly suspicious about the level of job protection an ERP would provide. Pullman could not get the sleeping car conductors to join the ERP, and eventually recognized the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors. By doing so, they avoided having the sleeping car conductors join the Order of Railway Conductors. The company signed an agreement with the OSCC that took effect on 1 January 1922. The contract confirmed that sleeping car conductors must be white males, and that they had the right to supervise and discipline porters and maids. According to the conductors, \\"the white traveling public, especially women, were unsafe alone in a car with a Negro porter.\\" In response to OSCC propaganda several southern states passed laws requiring white Pullman conductors to be in charge of sleeping cars in their jurisdictions. Because the order did not admit blacks, in 1925 A. Philip Randolph began organizing the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), the first African-American labor union to gain a collective bargaining agreement, and the first to be chartered by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). In June 1934 Congress amended the Watson-Parker Railway Labor Act so it explicitly covered non-operating train personnel and sleeping car companies. The new act was sponsored by Senator Clarence Dill, who thought Pullman porters and maids should be black. A jurisdictional dispute between the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters had to be settled by the American Federation of Labor, but the effect was to quadruple membership in the BSCP within a year. In 1934 the AFL Executive Council gave the OSCC jurisdiction over Pullman porters. A. Philip Randolph argued strongly in the American Federation of Labor against the discriminatory practices of the OSCC. He said, \\"the Sleeping Car Conductors Union is saturated with race prejudice as shown by a clause in its constitution barring Negroes from membership.\\" He went on, \\"If the Executive Council and the A.F. of L. Convention upholds the right of jurisdiction of the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors over sleeping car porters, the Brotherhood will have no other honorable alternative before it but to withdraw from the A.F. of L.\\" In August 1935 the AFL Executive Council backed down, although it took almost a year for independence of the porters from the conductors to be formalized. As of 1936 membership of the OSCC was about 2,200. The combined conductor-porter job represented by the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors was gradually being eliminated. The railroad companies used the practice of \\"running in charge\\" to employ black porters as conductors on short or designated routes, paying them more than the wage for porters but much less than the wage for a conductor. In 1940 the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors asked Congress to legislate to outlaw this practice on interstate sleeping cars. The bill was sponsored by Senator Sherman Minton. The BSCP did not take part in the debate, but the Pullman Company \\"stirred up the porters in opposition to this Bill by a representation that it was an attack upon their race.\\" Black religious and civic groups protested, and eventually Minton withdrew the bill. Dissolution In 1942 the National Mediation Board monitored an election in which the conductors voted to join the Order of Railway Conductors (ORC). Harry W. Fraser, president of the Order of Railway Conductors, encouraged the amalgamation. The OSCC was absorbed into the ORC in 1942.

Their first full-length, Lens, was originally released in 2008 on Redscroll Records. In February 2009, it was announced that the band would recorded their next album in April. In 2010, the band signed to Run for Cover Records and received national attention for their second full-length, Hostage Calm. The self-titled album was critically well-received, and widely praised for its ground-breaking, unique, angular sound. Hostage Calm displayed a marked musical and lyrical growth, incorporating elements of world music, Latin rhythms, power pop, post-hardcore, post-punk and other genres not typically associated with punk. A vocal advocate for LGBT equality, the band gave away its self-titled album for free in exchange of signing an online petition email to Senators opposing marriage equality in the eventually successful 2011 New York Senate vote. The record also featured the protest song, Ballots/Stones, which assailed the ongoing ban on same-sex marriage in much of America.

In 2017, they merged with another Canadian non-profit, the Foundation for Student Science and Technology (FSST). They exist to bridge the gap between the two parties and provide opportunities to excel which features youth-to-youth interactions to help them reach their potential. It is the place where ambitious youth can be at the forefront of innovation, and where young people have the chance to enrich their skills, be empowered to learn and grow, and be inspired to explore their passions and dreams. Science Expo is active from Vancouver to Toronto, with a network of 150 leaders reaching 80 high schools, representing a student body of over 120,000. They are best known for their annual conference, which has attracted thousands of high school students across Ontario to convene and connect with fellow like-minded students as well as leading innovators and scientists.  History Science Expo's History 2012.  Five individuals who met at the 2009 Canada Wide Science Fair and wanted to encourage more students to get involved in STEM opportunities founded Science Expo in 2010. Two months later, the first Science Expo, a 2-hour symposium, was held in a Guelph, Ontario high school auditorium. It attracted over 200 students, parents, and teachers, and featured Ph.D candidate and science fair guru Mubdi Rahman as the keynote speaker. The next year, the Science Expo team held its first full day conference at the University of Waterloo, and marked a milestone by successfully registering as a non-for-profit organization. In addition, a group of 5 interns joined the team that summer, 4 of whom stayed on as executives in the following year. Science Expo experienced a rapid surge in growth in 2012, expanding both its team size to a group of 13 high school and university students, and its reach to include the Greater Toronto Area. Science Expo 2012 was held at the Ontario Science Centre, and featured Nobel Prize winner Dr. Brad Bass as one of its keynote speakers. Today, Science Expo has grown to include several other outreach programs. These include a high school ambassador program, a teacher outreach program, and EXPOtential, the Science Expo alumni exclusive mentorship program. Through these outreach programs, the organization hopes to build a network of passionate students who are involved in STEM.  Programs  Science Expo features a variety of programs.OMNI News: Science Expo. 2013. High school students are invited to gather annually in February to participate in various workshops and are given opportunities to network with fellow peers and members of the STEM community. Keynote speakers have also been an exciting component to these conferences, with past speakers such as Dr. Steve Mann (Father of Wearable Computing) in 2013\\"Science Expo: Enrich, Empower, Explore.\\" MacAlpine J (2013-03-04 00:03:21).

Furthermore, Science Expo has created additional programs such as meriSTEM, a two-stage design competition for any high school student to creatively showcase any aspect of STEM. Launched in 2013, the winner of the first meriSTEM competition was Netra Unni whose project displayed nuclear programming to create stem cells.WNN. \\"Netra Unni won the Science Expo 2013 MeriSTEM competition.\\"Spencer, Jayce. \\"Glenforest wunderkind wins youth science competition with cancer research.\\" EXPOtential was also launched in 2013 as a Science Expo alumni network which aims to connect previous delegates with mentors to collaborate and further facilitate one's potential in the field. Science Expo is also known for their Ambassadors Program. The Ambassadors Program consists of more than 80 high school students from across Canada representing 40 different cities and regions. As an Ambassador for Science Expo, students support the Outreach Team by organizing various activities, initiatives, and events. Every November, more than 30 information sessions are organized, with the aim to catalyze a chain reaction of awareness on STEM opportunities. The purpose of this event is to inspire interest in STEM and to encourage students to participate academically outside of school. The value of this event does not lie in showcasing large scale opportunities though, but instead locally based opportunities and personal experiences. From the Ambassadors Program, students leave with developed soft and concrete skills, but also with experience, expanded professional networks, new friends, and the most important a memorable experience.

Biography Casmann started studying philosophy at the University of Marburg in 1581 under the guidance of Rudolf Goclenius the Elder. From September 1582 he studied philosophy and theology at the University of Helmstedt, where he earned a Magister degree. In 1587, he enrolled at the University of Heidelberg. Casmann started teaching at Helmstedt, where he gave lectures on logic in which he clearly spoke out against the teachings of the Aristotelian system. In 1589, Casmann joined the Sch√ºttorf Trivial School, which in 1591 was moved to Steinfurt and expanded to the academic Gymnasium Illustre. At Steinfurt he taught philosophy and anthropology. In 1594, Casmann obtained an appointment for the post of rector in Stade, where the City Council had set up a Gymnasium. In Stade, Casmann taught philosophy and theology, specializing in logic and natural philosophy. Otto Casmann died on 1 August 1607 in Stade when he was 45 years old. He was survived by his wife and three daughters. Anthropology and psychology Casmann is important to the history of anthropology and psychology. He began the separation of these two subjects from the Aristotelian framework of metaphysics, becoming a classical representative of the secularization of science in the early modern period. During his time at Steinfurt he produced the work Psychologia Anthropologica, sive doctrina animae Humanae (Hanau, 1594). There he consolidated the use of the term \\"anthropology\\" coined by Magnus Hundt (1449-1519). During his time in Stade, he wrote the second volume of Psychologia Anthropologica (Hanau, 1596) in which he described the construction of the human body. In 1594, Casmann defined anthropology as \\"the doctrine of human nature. Human nature is an essence partaking of two worlds, the spiritual and the corporeal, yet united in one vehicle.\\"In Latin: Anthropologia est doctrina humanae naturae. Humana natura est geminae naturae mundanae, spiritualis et corpareae, in unum hyphistamenon unitae particeps essentia. See This definition is still considered valid today.  References  =Sources= * D.

It is a young adult, fantasy, paranormal romance published in 2012 under Delacorte Press. It continues the story of Luce, Daniel and their angel companions who have nine days to search the world for a way to stop Lucifer from recreating the Fall and rewriting history. Therefore, they must determine the exact location where the angels fell to earth so many millennia ago. The group breaks up to find three relics that will give them the key to do so, but it's not as easy as it sounds. The angels and Luce have no idea what or where the relics are only rough sketches that Daniel drew centuries ago. However, the relics are not the only things that Luce needs to find. Goodreads is the only critic who reviewed the book, giving it a score of 4/5. An editorial review in Barnes and Noble said, \\"The fourth volume of Lauren Kate's Fallen novel series brings this story of human and angel love to a rapturous conclusion. Each of its predecessors has been an international bestseller and it's easy to see why: The story of Lucinda Price and her angelic boyfriend Daniel casting off lives and centuries as they search for an eternal union possesses magnetic appeal for a wide swath of readers.\\"  Synopsis  = Plot = Luce, Daniel, and the other angels had nine days to stop Lucifer from bending time and erasing everything since the Fall. They fought many Scale, the elders, Miss Sophia with the help of the Outcasts. They are in allegiance with the Outcasts now. In order to locate the site of the Fall, they have to find the three relics first. Everything was up to Luce this time. She now has the ability to see through her past lives without the use of an Announcer. She discovered her true nature on just her own. She knew that the curse prevented her from knowing her true nature as an angel, caused her to die whenever she began to approach a memory of her past. That's why none of the others could tell her who she was. She was once an angel and even became Lucifer's Evening Light. Lucinda and Lucifer had loved each other long before The Fall, and they invented love. Her first love has been Lucifer, and she had been his. Lucinda and Lucifer became the first beings to experiment with affection beyond God. He grew more possessive, more envious of Lucinda's adoration of the Throne. The reason why Lucifer wants to wipe the slate clean is because he wants to reset the universe to have Lucinda back‚Äîto choose him instead of Daniel. Lucinda loved Daniel more than Lucifer because Daniel wants her for who she is and he would never eclipse her with his desires. Her betrayal of Lucifer was what this Fall was all about. Lucinda loved Lucifer until it hurt her, until their love was consumed by his pride and rage. She stopped loving Lucifer because the thing that he called love made her disappear. Their adoration never diminished the Throne, but his love diminished her. In the end she was the angel who would tip the scales. The punishment that she bore in millennia, was for her, not Daniel's. During the fall, both Lucinda and Daniel still chose love as the highest of all. The Throne can't do anything about it because it is out of their hands. But it will come at a price‚Äîthe giving up of their angelic natures. They will be born again, made anew as mortals. They will not remember anything, no angel would cross their path, they will live and they will die, just like every other mortal. Luce and Daniel accepted but with one condition‚Äîto return the Outcasts back into the fold of Heaven. Seventeen years later, Luce is studying at Emerald College. Her parents drive her to Emerald and as they pass by the Sword & Cross Reform school, her parents say, \\"That's a little ominous. Glad you're not going to school there, Luce!\\" Luce did go to Sword & Cross in her former life, but she doesn't remember. There is a party after the orientation week on the other rooms at their dormitory. Luce is invited by her wacky roommate, Nora. Luce leaves the party to seek quiet air. When she is in the courtyard, she meets a really handsome boy‚Äîshort golden hair, soft-looking lips and gorgeous violet eyes. He introduced himself as Daniel. The line that Luce said to Daniel in the Fallen book (First Fallen novel book) but now it is Daniel who says to Luce...\\"You just‚Äîyou look so familiar. I could have sworn we've met somewhere before.\\" It's always that line that begins everything. And at that moment, Luce's and Daniel's angel friends (whom they don't remember now) Arriane, Roland, Annabelle, Miles and Shelby are watching them from above. = Recurring Characters = * Lucinda 'Luce' Price After the events in Torment, she will try to travel to her different past lives to find out what are the secrets Daniel is hiding from her, and she will find a way to end the curse that both their love has. * Daniel Grigori Luce's fallen angel boyfriend. He will try to bring Luce back to the present, from the shadows. He will realize that he, himself, can do something to end their curse. * Cameron 'Cam' Briel Cam is also a fallen angel. He will try to help Daniel recover Luce from the shadows, but Daniel would always refuse help. His past will be revealed and the reason for his being \\"evil\\" will be known. * Arriane Alter Arriane is another fallen angel, from Daniel's side. She will be one of the few who will try to get Luce back from the shadows. * Roland Sparks He is another fallen angel, from Cam's side. He will be able to speak to Luce in one of her past lives and know that she is from the future. * Mary Margaret 'Molly' Zane Fallen angel on Cam's side who has never gotten on with Luce since the beginning. * Gabrielle 'Gabbe' Givens Gabbe is a fallen angel on the side of Daniel. She tries her best to convince Daniel to side with Heaven. * Miles Fisher He is one of the Nephilim, and one of the first friends that Luce makes in Shoreline (in Torment). He proved how much he loves Luce in Torment. He will be helpful to Daniel in this book and he will soon be in good terms with him. * Shelby A Nephilim friend of Luce. She will be with Miles looking for Luce in the shadows. * Annabelle She was introduced briefly in Fallen, but will play some more minor roles in Passion. She is introduced to Luce as Arriane's older sister, with pink hair and calmer than Arriane. * Lucifer/Bill The first fallen angel. One of the reasons of the start of the Heaven War. He tricks Luce in the announcers appearing as a little gargoyle, Bill. He tries to make Luce kill one of her past lives. * Lyrica One of the remaining Elders. * Vivina One of the remaining Elders. = Types of characters = * Fallen Angels According to the Bible, a fallen angel is an angel who, coveting a higher power, ends up delivering \\"the darkness and sin.\\" The term \\"fallen angel\\" indicates that it is an angel who fell from heaven. The most famous is Fallen Angel Lucifer himself. The Fallen Angels are quite common in stories of conflict between good and evil. * Nephilim They are the children of fallen angels with mortals. * Outcast A particular rank of angels. Cam describes them as the worst kind of angel. They stood next to the bad one during the \\"revolt\\", but did not step into the underworld with him. Once the battle ended, they tried to return to heaven, but it was too late. He also mentions that when they tried to go to the underworld, the bad one cast them out permanently, and left them blind. Nevertheless, the outcasts have a tremendous control of the other four senses. In \\"torment\\", they chased Luce because they think that if they captured her, they will get back to heaven. * Elders It is not explained very well what the elders are, but they want to see Luce dead more than anything. Miss Sophia is the eldest and most important member. * Scale Are minor angels who remained faithful to the throne. They act as lawmakers for fallen as the monitor them on earth. They are described as having blue wings and wearing brown cloaks. Some reside inside the Announcers (also known as the \\"Shadows\\").  Legacy  = Sequels = The series was in total five books long.

History In the early 1920s the old boys of five of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales decided to establish a Sydney central business district base for their fellow alumni. Those involved in the development of this idea wanted to provide a clubhouse where men, who had recently left school and had undertaken business careers, could meet. It was anticipated that these club facilities would assist the schools' sporting and development appeals. The founding president was an Old Newingtonian, Eric Kelynack (1882-1957), who was a former chairman of the Institute of Incorporated Accountants. He was the son of the Rev Dr William Kelynack a notable Methodist churchman and former President of Newington. The club opened in premises owned by the Fairfax newspaper family at a building that was later demolished for the development of Australia Square. Membership Membership was originally open to the alumni of Newington College, The King's School, Sydney Grammar School, Sydney Church of England Grammar School and The Scots College. In 1970, the alumni of all Headmasters' Conference of the Independent Schools of Australia became eligible to join the club.UUSC About Us Retrieved 8 August 2013. Facilities Initially some facilities were shared but each member school managed a separate club room in its own style. Because some members were under the legal drinking age the club didn't become licensed until 1947. The original clubhouse was demolished in 1962 for the Australia Square development and the club transferred to a new building near Circular Quay. In the mid-1970s the club sold its premises and merged with the University Club.

It consisted of a majority of volunteers from Norway, and some enlisted German soldiers. Most officers and non-commissioned officers were Norwegian. It was formed in February 1942 and attached to the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord (although the company was formally a police unit). By the winter of 1943 the company was designated as a combat battalion, with three full infantry companies and a staff company. For almost its entire career, the battalion was part of the 6th SS Mountain Division \\"Nord\\", fighting on the Karelian Front in Finland. In 24‚Äì26 June 1944, nearly 100 of the battalion's soldiers went missing in action, when two of the battalion's positions (with a total of 190 soldiers) were overrun.M√∏tte d√∏den i myrhull  Operational history  During the winter of 1942, a Ski j√§ger Company, with a strength of 120 men, was formed in Finland with personnel undergoing training in the SS schools and training camps in Germany. The formation of the new Norwegian SS Skijaeger Battalion took place at military training grounds in Oulu, Finland in the autumn of 1943. The battalion CO and a four company commander were both Germans. A few German enlisted men were also included in each company as a \\"stiffening\\" element. For the most part the Norwegian officers were young men who had obtained front line experience with the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking or the \\"Frw. Legion Norwegen\\". The Norwegian Ski Battalion was strictly light-weight in nature consisting only of one staff company and three ski (or infantry/assault) companies. Each company consisted of three platoons, each with three \\"rifle\\" squads, and a fourth machine gun squad. The standard issue weapon for the battalion was the MP-40 Submachine Gun, which was the preferred weapon due to the units abilities to do Long-range reconnaissance patrol missions. In 1943 the Ski Company (Skikompaniet, the predecessor of the \\"Ski Battalion\\") was sent to the Kiestinki Front. The battalion was formed in Germany, transported to Oulu in Finland, and later reached Kuusamo. During the winter 1943/1944 the battalion counted around 700 men. As a consequence of an armistice in September 1944, the German Lapland Army, including the battalion, retreated through North Finland into Norway.

Seven surviving Munchkin actors attended the ceremony, including Mickey Carroll, Ruth Duccini, Jerry Maren, Margaret Pellegrini, Meinhardt Raabe, Karl Slover and Clarence Swensen. Maren said that due to previous engagements, the three members of the Lollipop guild did not stay in contact after Oz. In 2013 he stated \\"We pretty much separated because they all had previous engagements. Somebody had to go to Milwaukee, somebody had to go to Boston, New York, etc.\\" Other Roles Gerlich‚Äôs first acting experience was in the 1938 American Western Jed Buells The Terror Of Tiny Town, the world's only Western with an all-midget cast.

The churches, monasteries and convents of Assisi served as a safe haven for several hundred Jews during the German occupation. The Assisi Network was an underground network in Italy established by Catholic clergy to protect Jews during the Nazi Occupation. The churches, monasteries, and convents of Assisi served as a safe haven for several hundred Jews.  General History of Assisi  Holocaust historian Martin Gilbert credits the Assisi Network, established by Bishop Giuseppe Placido Nicolini and Father Rufino Nicacci, with saving 300 Jews. When the Nazis began to murder Jews, Monsignor Nicolini, Bishop of Assisi, under orders from Monsignor Montini, ordered Father Aldo Brunacci to lead a rescue operation using shelters in 26 monasteries and convents, and providing false transit papers. Many of the papers claimed the person was from Southern Italy, an area liberated by American forces. Among those that were helped by Nicolini were the Baruch, Viterbi and Kropf families. Nicolini hid Jews in places that were regularly closed to outsiders by papal monastic regulations. His \\"Committee of Assistance\\" transformed Assisi into a shelter for many Jews, and assisted others with transit through the town to other places of safety. Respect for Jewish religious practices saw Yom Kippur celebrated at Assisi in 1943, with nuns preparing the meal to end the fast.Assisi Network published by Yad Vashem Assisi is home to Francesco di Bernardone (St. Francis of Assisi) who was the founder of the Roman Catholics' Franciscan and St. Clare Orders. The activities of the network were the subject of a 1978 book, The Assisi Underground by Alexander Ramati, and a 1985 film starring Ben Cross and James Mason as Bishop Nicolini. Assisi was liberated on June 16, 1944.  Righteous among the Nations: Father Aldo Brunacci  Father Aldo Brunacci was the head of the Committee for Assistance and a canon in the Cathedral of San Rufino. He was recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem's publication in the year of 1977. Brunacci owned a huge library where he taught Latin to several people, including Mira Baruch, that enabled her to resume her studies after the war. On May 15, 1944, Father Brunacci was arrested by governor Rocchi Perugia, who suspected his involvement in the rescue missions. Through the Bishop of Assisi's intervention, Brunacci was released, but forced to leave Assisi. Testimony of Father Aldo Brunacci is available here = Famous Quotes = * \\"God is our father and we are all brothers and sisters.\\" * \\"There are times in everyone's life in which it is easy to confuse prudence with a calm life; there are times when heroism is required. Monsignor Nicolini took the path of heroism.\\"  Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust  The actions of Pope Pius XII, also known as Eugenio Pacelli (1876-1958), during the Holocaust remain highly controversial. He kept a public front of neutrality. Though he made public speeches condemning injustices of the world, Pope Pius XII did not take any direct or public action against Hitler and the Nazi regime. He privately sheltered a small number of Jews and encouraged select officials to help Jews. In 1933, while a cardinal, before being elected Pope, Pracelli signed a concordant with German diplomat Franz Von Papen that was considered a diplomatic victory for Hitler, and granted freedom of practice to the Roman Catholic church. In return, the Church was to abstain from political issues. Pacelli was elected Pope on March 2, 1939 and began speaking out against the 1938 Italian racial laws, though he did not condemn Kristallnacht. In that same month, Pius obtained 3,000 visas for European Jews who converted to Catholicism to enter Brazil. Two thousand of the visas were later revoked because those Jews continued to practice Judaism in Brazil. The Pope did not take any action on the revocations. Between 1940 and 1943, Pope Pius was confronted with demands to denounce the Nazi violence from individuals including: Chief Rabbi of Palestine, Isaac Herzog; Cardinal Theodor Innitzer of Vienna; Assistant Chief of the U.S. delegation to the Vatican, Harold Tittman; Ukrainian Metropolitan Andrej Septyckyj; Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, Wladislaw Raczkiewicz, president of the Polish government-in-exile; and Bishop Preysing of Berlin. The Church responded to these demands by stressing the Church's need to remain neutral. Any aid that the Pope provided Jews came after 1942 when US joined the war. At that time, Pope Pius began encouraging German and Hungarian bishops to speak out against the massacre of the Jews.  Viterbi Family The Viterbi family were able to live openly due to the false papers of identification provided by Brizi. In the papers they registered as residents of the town of Lecce, an area that was already liberated by the Americans, thus preventing the Nazi's from checking the papers validity. Grazia Viterbi's name was changed to Graziella Vitelli. However, even with the false papers and safe area of residence, the family was in a constant fear of capture by the Nazis. To familiarize herself in the event of capture, Grazia learned about the town of Lecce at the Assisi library.

It made itself a name due to the participation in the aftereffects destruction of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Gulf of Mexico (2010).  History  West Siberian innovation center. Tyumen, 2012 The founder of the RSI Julia Deneko (born in 1982) graduated the Faculty of Ecology and Geography of the Tyumen State University (TSU), worked as the chief specialist of the business support center of research and technology within the Science park of the TSU. Together with her father Victor Ryadinskiy, the head of the TSU's Science park was the co-author of several inventions. The company was founded by Julia in 2005 after two years by graduation the University. In April 2009 RSI turned out to be in the first 5 companies obtained the resident status within the business incubator of the (The Tyumen Science park), its innovation project was called ¬´The use of the fibre \\"oil sorbent boom\\" for oil-contaminated flows clean up¬ª. In 2008, the company obtained a grant from the for project development. In 2010, RSI took part in the aftereffects destruction of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Gulf of Mexico (United States): it supplied materials and waged a field supervision. In December, 2012 the company has applied for inclusion into the science park ¬´WISTA¬ª (Berlin, Germany) residents.  Structure  The information about the head of the company is contradictory. According to one data, the CEO of the company is Julia Deneko, according to the other one ‚Äì her father and co-author of the inventions Victor Ryadinskiy. Sometimes Julia Deneko is called as a Chief marketing officer. The company has 10 affiliates in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. The main landfills of RSI are near Tyumen, in the area of Verkhniy Bor. In the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug the landfill mobile plant Dekontamobil () is used; the plant was awarded by the ¬´National environment award¬ª in 2009.  Activity  = Technology = RSI owns 6 patented technologies and 14 certified materials. On the forum ¬´The new technologies of the oil waste processing and the contaminated land revegetation¬ª held in Moscow, in 2012, the participants displayed a high interest to the oil sorbent boom, the local above gas flare device for use of associated petroleum gas; and the landfill mobile plant Dekontamobil.  The fiber oil sorbent boom  The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, sight from Space. May 24, 2010 The workers are preparing the boom defence. Gulf of Mexico. April 30, 2010 The most known technology of the company is the fiber oil sorbent boom. The ideologist of the invention is Petr Gvozdyak ‚Äì the doctor of Biological Sciences, the professor of the Colloid chemistry and the Water chemistry Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (Kyiv), who invented the method of sewage treatment by bioremediation (SU 1428713 A1 patent). The staff of the laboratory of the Research Institute of Ecology and Natural Resources Management of the TSU patented the consortium of oil eating microbes Arthrobacter Oxydans-091 and Pseudomonas putida, but the RU 2275466 C1 patent put out of action in 2007. Therefore, the authors Victor Ryadinskiy and Julia Deneko applied for the new patent (RU 2431017 C1 patent) in 2010. The essence of the technology is that the special fibers saturated with oil eating microbes are fastened on the floating booms. The fibers hook up the oil patches on themselves and microbes biodegrade it during several days, oil is decomposed into carbonic acid and water. The fiber attachments do not hinder the water flow. Also it has the largest absorbing surface area: 5-10 thous. m2 per 1 cubic metre of the construction. The tests on the river show the reduction of the petroleum product concentration of water column in 4 times, the surface pellicular oil reduced in 43 times. The project became the finalist of the ¬´‚Äì2009¬ª and the ¬´-2011¬ª. The technology was applied in the time of the aftereffects Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Gulf of Mexico, 2010. RSI worked under the contract with the American company TransGlobal Remediation Group. The American bacteria raised by the researchers from Texas (Texas A&M; University System, United States) were used because of the long awaiting of the microbes import permission from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The pyrolysis plant by TransGlobal Remediation Group  In the result of the partnership with TransGlobal Remediation Group in the time of the aftermath's destruction of the Gulf of Mexico accident, RSI got the exclusive right to distribute the American pyrolysis plants into Russia. The plants allow the processing of any organic compound at a rate of from 115 kg to 8 tons per hour with the performance 99%. On the downstream the synthetic fuel, biogas, biofuel and electric energy are generated.  The local above gas flare device  Gas flare in taiga. Western Siberia, the beginning of the 1980s The device allows the increasing of the combustion temperature of the associated petroleum gas; as a result, the majority of pollutants will burn down inside gas flare. It causes the reduction of pollutant emissions into the atmosphere (according to the developer ‚Äì in 20-40 times). The obtained heat can be used in greenhouses. The company obtained a grant from the Governor of the Tyumen Oblast for the realization of its technology. In October, 2011, the head of RSI was proposed by the head of the community ¬´Futurerussia Skolkovo¬ª Ivan Burtnik to apply for the including in the list of residents of the Skolkovo Innovation Center (Skolkovo, Moscow Oblast, Russia). The first successful tests of the plant were held in March, 2012. The technology is planned for its needs by the company ILF Consulting Engineers (Munich, Germany).  Decontamix  The name originates from the words ¬´decontamination¬ª (purification) and ¬´mix¬ª (mixing). This material is the type of so-called ¬´burolit¬ª mixture ‚Äì the product of the drilled cuttings processing, it is used for the highways building. Victor Ryadinskiy built the so-called earth house of the decontamix on his own land lot, in the village of Reshetnikova, near Tyumen. He called it ¬´burlyanka¬ª. A house from such material can be built in 2‚Äì5 days, its thermal insulation is provided by the soil layer 1,5 m thick and by grass and snow. The project of burlyanka was awarded by the golden medal in the nomination ¬´The best exposition¬ª on the exhibition ¬´The landscape design and architecture held¬ª in Tyumen, on May 15‚Äì19, 2013.

It is able to pump 115 cubic meters of viscous liquid fluid per hour from the depth up to 30 meters.  3D-Vision Space  It exists only in the design phase. The idea is based on the technology of pattern recognition, owned by the Russian company ¬´Papillon Systems¬ª (Miass, Chelyabinsk Oblast), the resident of the business incubator Plug and Play Tech Center (Sunnyvale, California) in Silicon Valley (United States). RSI proposed to use this technology for the recognition of the both pollutant free and contaminated territories. From the American side, the formalization of the information on the environmental technologies is represented by the KMT International, Inc (Fremont, California). = Capacities = RSI has implemented several hundred projects for leading oil companies in northern Russia. The company processed circa 1 million cubic meters of the drilling wastes, held the revegetation of circa 1,000 hectares of disturbed and contaminated lands. 80% of offers are obtained from the Tyumen Oblast (including autonomous okrugs).

They find applications in natural language processing, where they can be used for machine-learned parsing or classification of sentences.  Motivation  In natural language processing, it is often necessary to compare tree structures (e.g. parse trees) for similarity. Such comparisons can be performed by computing dot products of vectors of features of the trees, but these vectors tend to be very large: NLP techniques have come to a point where a simple dependency relation over two words is encoded with a vector of several millions of features. It can be impractical to represent complex structures such as trees with features vectors. Well-designed kernels allow computing similarity over trees without explicitly computing the feature vectors of these trees. Moreover, kernel methods have been widely used in machine learning tasks ( e.g. SVM ), and thus plenty of algorithms are working natively with kernels, or have an extension that handles kernelization. An example application is classification of sentences, such as different types of questions.  Examples  Constituency parse tree for the sentence : \\"A cat eats a mouse.\\" Same as above, for the sentence : \\"A mouse eats a cat.\\" Here are presented two examples of tree kernel applied to the constituency trees of the sentences \\"A cat eats a mouse.\\" and \\"A mouse eats a cat.\\". In this example \\"A\\" and \\"a\\" are the same words, and in most of the NLP applications they would be represented with the same token. The interest of these two kernels is that they show very different granularity (the subset tree kernel being far more fine-grained than the subtree kernel), for the same computation complexity. Both can be computed recursively in time O(T1.T2). = Subtree kernel = In the case of constituency tree, a subtree is defined as a node and all its children (e.g., [NP [D [A [N [mouse ] is a subtree of the two trees). Terminals are not considered subtree (e.g. [a] is not a subtree). The subtree kernel count the number of common subtrees between two given trees. In this example, there are seven common subtrees: :[NP [D [a [N [cat ], :[NP [D [a [N [mouse ], :[N [mouse , :[N [cat , :[V [eats , :[D [a (counted twice as it appears twice). = Subset tree kernel = A subset tree is a more general structure than a subtree. The basic definition is the same, but in the case of subset trees, leaves need not be terminals (e.g., [VP [V] [NP is a subset tree of both trees), but here too single nodes are not considered as trees. Because of this more general definition, there are more subset trees than subtrees, and more common subset trees than common subtrees. In this example, there are 54 common subset trees. The seven common subtrees plus among others: :[NP [D] [N (counted twice), :[VP [V [eats [NP ...  See also  *Graph kernel *Parse tree  Notes   References  *Jun Sun, Min Zhang and Chew Lim Tan.

It was created in 2013 by Keith Carroll, a Georgia Institute of Technology PhD candidate, in order to demonstrate a technique called thermochemical nanolithography (TCNL) that was invented at the university. In TCNL, a tiny cantilever viewed through an atomic force microscope uses heat to activate a series of chemical reactions that create new molecules. Greater amounts of heat create more molecules which lighten the surface of the substrate, allowing a grayscale image to be created. The Mini Lisa is just wide, about a third the width of a human hair. It is roughly 1/25,000th the size of the Mona Lisa. The Mini Lisa was created by making hundreds of individual points each wide. Carroll decided to recreate the Mona Lisa after a challenger claimed TCNL was not precise enough to create a work of art. He created an automated process to create any image desired based on a supplied heat map. The Mini Lisa project, which also included recreations of photographs by Ansel Adams, was published in Langmuir in August 2013. The paper's lead author, physicist Jennifer Curtis, said the experiment demonstrated for the first time that it was possible not only to manipulate molecules on a nano-scale, but also precisely control how many are there.

Headquartered in Istanbul, it emerged in March 2012 from a split inmidst the foundation phase of the Syria Turkmen Bloc, which is the other major Syrian Turkmen movement. Since another regrouping in December 2012 drove many of its more prominent members back to the Syria Turkmen Bloc, the Syrian Democratic Turkmen Movement now focusses on its stronghold in Aleppo province, where it is considered to have some leverage within the Turkmen parts of civil society. It however cooperates with the Latakia and Bayƒ±r-Bucak-focussed Bloc in the Syrian Turkmen Assembly. The Movement is a member of the Syrian National Council and is represented in the Syrian National Coalition. Militarily, it is allied with Ali Basher's Aleppo branch of the Syrian Turkmen Brigades.  History  In November 2011, Bekir Atacan's Syrian Turkmen Group, an organization of prominent and exile Syrian Turkmen, and Ali √ñzt√ºrkmen's more street- and networking-affine Syrian Turkmen Movement had joined forces to form the Syria Turkmen Bloc. Atacan and √ñzt√ºrkmen were already appointed the first chairman resp. deputy chairman. Prior to the Blocs official establishment on 15 February 2012, the two leaders however left, with Atacan citing his failed efforts to further enlarge the Bloc as the reason.Interview with Bekir Atacan in: Joining forces with young Syrian Turkmens living in Turkey, they launched another formation, the Syrian Democratic Turkmen Movement. The new Movement was founded on 21 March 2012 in Istanbul, under the auspices of representatives of Turkey's Islamist Great Unity Party (BBP), the Iraqi Turkmen Front and of √úlk√º Ocaklarƒ±, the \\"Grey Wolves\\" youth branch of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). The new movement's first leader Abdulkerim Aƒüa stressed their determination to \\"take an active role in Syrian politics,\\" while reaching out to \\"all the various actors of the Syrian opposition to achieve a democratic and civilized Syria\\". The first meeting of the reconciliatory Syrian Turkmen Platform (now: Syrian Turkmen Assembly) on 15 December 2012 led to another regrouping, with some of the Movement's more prominent figures leaving, again including Atacan, to give the idea of a wide political party on behalf of the Syrian Turkmens yet another try. While they eventually reconciled with the Syria Turkmen Bloc, the Movement decided to carry on, refocussing on its stronghold in Aleppo, and appointing Ziyad Hasan and Tarƒ±k Sulo Cevizci the new chairman and deputy chairman. The Syria Turkmen Bloc on the other hand focusses on its strongholds in Latakia and Bayƒ±r-Bucak. Positions The Syrian Democratic Turkmen Movement asserts that there are 3.5 million Turkmens in Syria. However, the party is against a divided Syria because Syrian Turkmens live scattered in various cities such as Aleppo, Homs, Latakia, Azaz, Jarablus, Raqqah, Idlib, Hama and Damascus, and a divided Syria would do serious damage to the interests of the Turkmens. In an interview with Turkish think-tank ORSAM, the later chairman Ziyad Hasan in February 2012 stated the main political expectations of the Turkmens he represents as following: * a constitutional drafting process with Turkmen's participation * the transition to a multi- party system * the recognition of Turkmen as a primary component of Syria * establishment of the Turkish language as an official language in areas with a strong Turkmen minority * Turkish language courses in public schools and removal of legal barriers against native language education * reinforcement of local governments' authority * a sustainable economic development process to improve economic conditions of all Syrian people Hasan deplored the relative calm in Aleppo compared to other regions of the country, explaining it with insecurity due to the presence of various ethnis and religious groups, and the metropolitan lifestyle of the city. While he said the vast majority of Turkmens in Aleppo supported the uprising, Assyrians and Armenians feared an emerging Islamic regime. He considered the Kurds as a major power in the region, and as heavily influenced by the PKK, which ‚Äì in line with the Turkish government's position ‚Äì he brands a \\"terrorist organization\\".Interview with Ziyad Hasan in: Activities =Diplomatic efforts= The Movement is represented in the Syrian Turkmen Assembly, which it initiated as a supra- political-parties structure to alleviate the split within the Syrian Turkmen community. Stressing the diplomatic efforts with Turkey and the Syrian opposition, delegating 16 representatives to the Syrian National Council and 3 Turkmen representatives to the Syrian National Coalition. =Political and military activism= On the ground, the Movement was said to carry out almost all [Turkmen] political, civilian and military activities in Aleppo. It is associated with Ali Basher, who commands the Syrian Turkmen Brigades in the province of Aleppo such as Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, Zahir Baybars Brigade, Martyr Ali Yƒ±lmaz Troop, Suleiman Shah Troop, Alparslan Troop, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m Beyazƒ±t Brigade, and Sultan Abdul Hamid Troops.

Neururer did his studies for the priesthood in Brixen before he served as a teacher and pastor in several cities before settling in 1932 in G√∂tzens near Innsbruck. He was arrested in 1938 for attempting to persuade a girl not to be wed to a man of questionable morals and was sent to Dachau before being transferred to Buchenwald where he died after being hanged upside down. Neururer's beatification was celebrated on 24 November 1996 based on the fact that he died as a result of \\"in odium fidei\\" (the hatred of the faith). Life Otto Neururer was born on 25 March 1881 as the last of twelve children to the poor and modest farmers Alois Neururer and Hildegard Streng. His parents managed a small farm with a mill. He was a timid (noted as having had a subdued temperament) but academic man who battled depression much like his mother did. His devout mother would suffer from these occasional bouts of depression following her husband's death when Neururer was a child at the age of eight. He studied for the priesthood in Brixen (which his uncle helped support) under the Vincentians from 1895 (he did his theological studies from 1903 onwards) before he was ordained to the priesthood on 29 June 1907. He celebrated his first Mass as a priest in his hometown. Neururer also wanted to become a Jesuit so he could join their missions though his delicate health at the time prevented him from being able to pursue that path. He served as a curate and as a teacher of religious education in the Saint James parish from 1917 until 1932 following his ordination and later joined the Christian Social Movement (in the spirit of the papal document Rerum Novarum) despite the fact that it put him at odds with his conservative superiors. His first assignment as a priest was spent in Urdens in Zillertal and then in Oberinntal before being sent to Kappl in Paznautal. He was then sent to Innsbruck and then in 1932 was sent to his final assignment as a pastor in G√∂tzens near Innsbruck to the Saints Peter and Paul parish church. The Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938 led to the arrest of several priests.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933‚Äì1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p. 145 Neururer was serving as a parish priest in G√∂tzens near Innsbruck at the time that this was taking place. He advised a girl not to become married to a divorced man (known for having lived a dissolute and atheistic life) owing to his questionable morals, but it happened that this man was a personal friend of Franz Hofer (the Nazi Gauleiter of Tirol). The girl refused to listen to the priest's advice and told this man, who in turn reported Neururer to the authorities. Neururer was arrested on 15 December 1938 as a result of his actions on the charge of \\"slander to the detriment of German marriage\\" and sent on 3 March 1939 to the Dachau Concentration Camp before later being sent on 26 September 1939 to Buchenwald where he faced frequent torture. In prison he shared his scarce food rations with prisoners in a weaker condition. Neururer (despite suspecting a trap) agreed to perform a forbidden baptism at the camp for a prisoner who approached him in April 1940 and was sent to the punishment block when his action was discovered not long after. There he was hanged upside down and naked until he died after 34 hours of agony. It was said that this execution was conducted on the orders of the sadistic SS Hauptscharf√ºhrer (master sergeant) Martin Sommer ‚Äì the \\"Hangman of Buchenwald\\".The resistance in Austria, 1938‚Äì1945 by Radom√≠r Lu≈æa Publisher: University of Minnesota Press (April 9, 1984) The chaplain Alfred Berchtold (1904-85) witnessed Neururer's final torture and said that he never complained but would mumble while he was still conscious. His remains were cremated on 3 June 1940 (the Nazis later attributed his death to \\"acute cardiac weakness\\") and his ashes sent in an urn to G√∂tzens later that same month which is now located under the altar of the G√∂tzens parish church. Beatification The beatification process opened on 23 May 1983 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official edict \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) and titled Neururer as a Servant of God; the diocesan process was conducted in Innsbruck from 20 November 1983 until 8 December 1986. It was following this investigation that the documentation was sent to the C.C.S. in Rome where on 14 June 1991 the C.C.S. validated the diocesan process as having complied with their regulations and therefore deeming that process to have been valid. The official Positio dossier was sent to the C.C.S. sometime after so that the cause could be investigated further. Theologians first assented to the cause on 19 May 1995 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 21 November 1995. Neururer was cleared for beatification on 12 January 1996 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the priest had died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith).

This tree grows in cloud forests with about 2000 to 4000 mm of rainfall per year. It is found mostly on the peaks and slopes of mountains, thriving best in volcanic areas. These soils are derived from igneous rocks (including serpentine), have high clay content, and are moderately well drained, with pH between 5 and 7.5. Abundant moisture in the soil is typical and may be essential for the development of the jaguilla. Key features Leaves are large, oval shaped, and waxy, and are alternate on the stem. Leaves and stems are free of hairs, distinguishing it from the closely related Magnolia splendens that grows in the eastern mountains. The Jaguilla produces white flowers that are large, fragrant and showy. The flowers are hermaphroditic. The numerous carpels each have a curved style that peaks in the center; each carpel is pale yellow and about 6 mm to 12 mm long. There are numerous stamens surrounding the carpels; they are each about 13 mm long. After pollination (perhaps by beetles as in other Magnolia species) the fruit that it produces is conical in shape and greenish, measuring about 3.5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide. The fruits crack open when ripe, revealing triangular seeds with fleshy orange arils that aid in their dispersal by birds. Rodents are seed predators. Inside the seeds, there is an oil in the endosperm that surrounds the embryo that is found in about 50% of all magnolias. Seedlings are shade tolerant and the tree is slow growing. Association of the roots with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is essential for growth. Plant uses The jaguilla has high wood quality so it is used for furniture and lumber. Previously it had been used to shade high-altitude coffee plantations that have since been abandoned. The oil of the Magnolia is an ingredient in soap, lotions and perfumes Conservation The species population is currently endangered because of deforestation, and the population continues to decline. Puerto Rico currently has no conservation efforts for the tree.Alemany-Merly, S. E. 1999. Magnolia portoricensis Bello = Jaguilla: Magnoliaceae: Magnolia family.

Description  Centruroides alayoni is a moderate-sized scorpion, with a typical length of . It is distributed in northern Iran. Its sandy dull brown colour matches the surrounding environment, giving it camouflage protection. Its pedipalps are small relative to its size, indicating that it instead uses its stinger to subdue its prey. It has a potent venom, capable of killing a dog in a single sting, if not a human.  Attempt at farming  In 1982, Iran was suffering serious financial losses as a result of the ongoing Iran-Iraq War. A desperate scheme was thought up by businessman Mohammed Amehi, in which Centruroides alayoni would be farmed for its highly valuable venom. It would then be sold, in barrels, to Allied Egypt, which was faring better economically. Amehi began his first attempt at farming the scorpion in May 1983, backed by government funding. From June 1983 - October 1983, the farm produced of scorpion venom, which, although being worth about $4.2 million US, was a disastrous yield, barely covering the expenses of the venture. Further trouble struck when Amehi was accidentally stung while visiting the farm; he become violently ill, and was resting when a young worker was asked to retrieve the antivenom. Instead, the worker took a bottle of farmed venom and assisted the injection of it into Amehi. Amehi died shortly after, and the project fell apart in disaster. Some historians claim that the actions of the \\"worker\\" were deliberate, and that he was an Iraqi spy under homeland government orders to put a stop to the project. Whether Amehi's death was an accident or not is still unknown.

Since Chortitza was the first Mennonite settlement in Russia, it was known as the \\"Old Colony\\". In the course of the 19th century the population of the Chortitza Colony multiplied, and daughter colonies were founded. Part of the settlement moved to Canada in the 1870s, and the Canadian community, whose church was officially known as the \\"Reinl√§nder Mennoniten Gemeinde\\", was still informally known by the old name. When members of the Old Colony Mennonites then moved from Canada to other places, the name was kept. Old Colony Mennonites are typically more conservative than most other Russian Mennonites in North America. , Old Colony Mennonite communities could be found in Mexico, Bolivia, Belize, Paraguay, Canada, the United States of America.

The Coronation  The event takes place generally on the last Sunday in May and recalls the episode of the coronation of Matilda of Canossa at the hands of Henry V, occurred at the foot of the Castle of Bianello between 6 and 10 of May of the year 1111. The Emperor was the son of Henry IV who, 30 years before, obtained from Pope Gregory VII, through the mediation of Matilde, the ‚Äúforgiveness of Canossa‚Äù. Donizone from Canossa, Matilda‚Äôs biographer and chronicler of that time, says that the Emperor reached the Castle of Bianello when back from Rome and he crowned the Grand Duchess with the title of \\"Imperial Vicar Vice-Queen of Italy\\". This episode was the decisive step towards the Concordat of Worms. Historical sources report that the ceremony took place in the churchyard of the St Antonino Church, not far from where the event is currently taking place.  The Show  The show is the theatrical re-enactment of the historical episode, with the figure of Matilda and of the Emperor Henry V, commonly interpreted by known figures from the entertainment, culture and sport.

The algorithm uses infrared (IR) satellite data from global geosynchronous satellites as the primary source of precipitation information. Precipitation from IR images is based on statistical relationship between cloud top temperature and precipitation rates. The IR-based precipitation estimates are then calibrated using satellite microwave data available from low Earth orbit satellites (e.g., Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager, Special Sensor Microwave Imager, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer‚ÄêEarth observing system). The calibration technique relies on an adaptive training algorithm that updates the retrieval parameters when microwave observations become available (approximately at 3 hours intervals). The PERSIANN satellite precipitation data sets have been validated with ground-based observations and other satellite data products. The PERSIANN data has been used in a wide variety of studies including hydrologic modeling, drought monitoring, soil moisture analysis, and flood forecasting. The PERSIANN data are freely available to the public.

A maunch (from the French manche \\"sleeve\\") is a heraldic charge representing a detachable lady's sleeve with a wide pendulous cuff, as was fashionable amongst women in the 13th and 14th centuries. They are found most frequently in English heraldry, occurring to a lesser extent in the heraldry of France, Scotland, and other nations. In the Middle Ages, it was common for ladies to give their sleeves as favours for knights to wear in tournaments. Thus, heraldic maunches came to symbolise that the armiger was popular with the ladies, or that he loved his wife. Alternatively maunches can occur as canting arms, such as in the arms of the Mohun and Mansel families. In French heraldry, they are referred to as manches mal taill√©e (meaning \\"badly cut sleeves\\") to distinguish them from ordinary sleeves. In Literature In Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte Darthur\\", Sir Lancelot fights in a tournament anonymously as an unknown knight using a white shield with a red sleeve on it. He also affixes Lady Elaine le Blanc's sleeve to his helmet to further disguse himself as he has never worn a lady's token of affection in a tournament.

Exercise Dawn Blitz is a military exercise, as such it is meant to allow military personnel to simulate and practice situations they might encounter in the course of their duties.

Being his trainee for couple of years, he was accepted in K.N.Toosi University of Technology and continued his mountaineering life with the university mountaineering group. In order to be a professional mountaineer, he joined Arash alpine club in 2007.  Education and career  Bozorgi got third place in Khwarizmi competition 2005. He was educated in Tehran, Iran, receiving a Bachelor's degree in Electrical engineering at K.N.Toosi University of Technology 2013. He was ranked 5th in 18th national Economics Olympiad. He also ranked 11th in the national Master's degree exam in Economics 2013.  Setting Iran route  Bozorgi (with Pouya Keivan and Mojtaba Jarahi) successfully completed a new route on the Southwest Face of Broad Peak they had been working on since 2009. The descent proved to be more complicated than expected. Climber Thomas Laemmle, who helped with the unsuccessful search and rescue attempt, stated that he believed Bozorgi and his companions were dead, and the search operation on Broad Peak was formally called off. They have been presumed dead.

Gameplay  The player controls a character with fairly standard 2-D controls: left, right, duck, and jump. The player also controls a camera viewfinder, the Snapshot of the title, with the mouse. When a snapshot is taken of an in-game object, it disappears from the gameworld and is stored on the camera; the stored images can then be pasted into new parts of the gameworld to overcome an obstacle. The objects and elements that can be captured have a wide range of different properties or utilities, such as elephants that serve as walking springboards or gusts of wind that can push the player across long gaps. In addition to completing the individual levels, there are also awards given for collecting all stars in a level, beating time challenges and taking snapshots of specific items in a level and retaining them until the level is exited.  Development  Snapshot was created and the second project by a Tempe, Arizona-based developer Kyle Pulver who developed the game together with Peter Jones and Dave Carrigg of Retro Affect. The game was developed using the graphical library SDL.  Reception  The game was favorably received by the critics. It holds a score of 74/100 on Metacritic review score aggregator.

Biography Hartley Vincent Amos was born in Lindfield, New South Wales on 2 December 1916, the eldest son of an insurance company manager. Amos attended Artarmon Public School and North Sydney Boys High School before joining the brewing firm of Tooth and Co. as a clerk in the firm's advertising department. In 1933 he enrolled at East Sydney Technical College where he studied life drawing and oil painting until the end of 1937. He was close friends with his cousin, Paul Brickhill (the best-selling author of The Great Escape, The Dam Busters, and Reach for the Sky) and Peter Finch (Academy Award winning actor). Later in life Due to the shortage of work Amos joined the army in 1938, enlisting as a signaller in the 7th Field Artillery but eventually becoming the unit‚Äôs camouflager, serving in New Guinea and Borneo, and obtaining the rank of Lieutenant, before he was discharged on 21 December 1945. Still wanting a career in the art world he sold cartoons to Rydges and Quiz before worked freelance for K.G. Murray Publishing Company. Amos' first assignment for K.G. Murray was to draw a full comic book, The Lost Patrol. The strip dealt with Australian soldiers fighting in New Guinea against the Japanese, for which he was able to call upon his own first-hand experience. Amos went on to produce a further series of comics, including The Moon Mirror, Stark, The Stoneage Man, Kidnap Cavern, Queen of the Green Men and Hurricane Hardy, at which time he was offered the job of illustrating the Devil Doone comic strip, written by Ron Carson-Gold, which appeared in the Man Junior Magazine. Devil Doone was a soldier of fortune strip that had previously been handled for a brief period by June Mendoza and Carl Lyon. Amos took over the strip in April 1946 and continued to draw the monthly strip for 44 issues until the middle of 1969. Devil Doone was also reprinted in comic book form. Writing in Cartoonists in Australia (View Productions, 1983), Amos recalled: \\"During all this time...I had not taken a holiday and was slipping into the trap of work overload. And one morning the trap snapped shut...I hit a psychological block and found I couldn't draw a damn thing! Frightened stiff, I had to quit Murray magazines and ease off from the pressure of publishing deadlines.\\" After leaving K.G. Murray, Amos was persuaded to take on the illustration work for John Dixon's comic strip, Air Hawk and the Flying Doctors. His first pages for Air Hawk and the Flying Doctors appeared in March 1970 with his last one published in June 1977, when he decided to retire from comic strip illustrations.

They have reduced cushioning, thin soles, a wide toe box, and are of lighter weight than other running shoes, allowing for more sensory contact for the foot on the ground while simultaneously providing the feet with some protection from ground hazards and conditions (such as pebbles and dirt). Research shows that wearing a minimalist shoe can help improve foot strength and arch function.  Types  Generally, there are two types of minimalist shoes: * Barefoot Running Shoes are characterized by their zero drop from heel to toe, no arch support, minimal cushioning at the heel, and a very thin sole of around 3-10mm. Also, the toe box is considerably wider to provide more space to the toes, whereby they slightly resemble the shape of ducks feet, when viewed from above and compared to traditional shoes. Few product lines fall into this category. Examples include the Vibram FiveFingers and Merrell Glove, which use an outsole produced by Vibram, or the Xero Prio. * Minimalist Running Shoes are in between traditional running shoes and barefoot running shoes. They have a reduced heel-to-toe drop of about 4‚Äì8 mm, reduced cushioning and reduced or no arch support. The toe box is usually in- between barefoot and traditional running shoes. In recognition of the barefoot running movement, major companies also started producing shoes targeted at this customer segment. However, these shoes do not usually meet the requirement of a minimal or barefoot shoe. Examples include: * The Nike Free, which has a 17 mm heel and is marketed as minimalist running shoe, though this designation is disputed by some. * The Adidas Adizero line, which has a heel- to-toe drop of 4 to 10mm, a total heel height of up to 30mm and a comparatively traditional, narrow toe box. * The Champion Alpha. In contrast to barefoot and minimal shoes, one of the marketing terms repeatedly employed for this product segment is natural running.

Brandt - Clavus / 29) Erik Bredal was born in the town of Rudk√∏bing, on the island of Langeland in south-central Denmark. Bredal came from a clerical family. His father was a parish priest in Rudk√∏bing and provost in N√∏rre Herred. His grandfather was vicar of Vinding Parish, in Tyrsting Herred. After schooling at Sor√∏ Academy, he came to Nyk√∏bing Falster, where he became rector of the Latin school in 1633. From 1637, he was a student at the University of Rostock, earning his Magister degree in 1639.Immatrikulation von Ericus Bredalinus (Universit√§t Rostock) In 1640 he became pastor of Church of Our Saviour (Vor Frelsers Kirke) at Christianshavn on the island of Amager. The community and church were both in formation at that time. In 1643, he was appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros (Trondhjems Stift) which included Tr√∏ndelag. His zealous reform efforts led to clashes of interests with local priests on a series of issues, such as the appointment of resident curates, the status of priests' widows, and duties and quality of education.Erik Bredal (Biographiske Efterretninger om Geistligheden i Trondhjems Stift) Tr√∏ndelag was ceded in 1658 to Sweden under the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde and was ruled by Sweden. Clergy could retain their positions if they swore allegiance to the Swedish king. Bishop Bredal refused to submit to the enemy, and temporally relocated north to Trondenes in Troms county with his family. The Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660 restored Tr√∏ndelag to Norwegian control and placed Erik Bredal back as Bishop of Tr√∏ndelag where he served until his death in 1672.

Team Solar was unsuccessful in lobbying Kerala Govt to get include in ANERT programmes. Incident The Team Solar Energy Company (Team Solar), floated by the main accused Biju Radhakrishnan and Saritha. S. Nair, directors of the company, allegedly collected advance amounts from large number of people and investors by offering to make them business partners, or in the guise of installing alternate sources of energy and failed to deliver the goods. The company awarded a \\"Virgin Earth Golden Feather Environment Award\\" to several prominent people of Kerala to gain media coverage and credibility. The scam came to light when one of the customers who had paid for the installation filed a case against the company. The arrangement has defrauded several agencies and people to the tune of crores of rupees and at least one lady actor was used as \\"brand ambassador\\" to lure gullible people. There were widespread protests across the state, mainly by Leftist youth groups, after an interview with an industrialist was aired on television, which alleged fraud by the company. The incident drew much attention because most of those who lost big money were all influential people, the women allegedly involved fueled the imagination/ jealousy of the depraved Malayalam Media and the alleged involvement of three officials from the office of the Chief Minister of Kerala, Oommen Chandy, who made several phone calls to Saritha. It caused great embarrassment to Chandy, who faced demands for his resignation; two of the officials involved in phone conversation, lost their positions. The total amount involved in the scam, calculated on the basis of complaints, is less than but the aggressive protests by Leftist political parties and the modus operandi used by the company has made the scam notorious. Arrests Five persons have been arrested in connection with this scam. The chief accused, Saritha Nair and one of the Chief Minister's personal aides Tenny Joppan has been fired and arrested. The director of the Public Relations Department, who allegedly received Rs 500,000 from the Team Solar man, has been suspended and has gone underground fearing arrest. Other people accused in the case, who have been arrested include Biju Radhakrishnan, and Malayalam movie/TV actress and danseuse, Shalu Menon. =Biju Radhakrishnan= Biju Radhakrishnan was already caught in a case pertaining to the murder of his wife Rashmi. However, despite having evidence of his involvement in the murder, he was not arrested After his arrest, at Coimbatore, by the Kollam Crime Branch CID, he admitted to Rashmi's murder by giving her poisoned liquor. =Saritha S Nair= Saritha Nair was a director of the Team Solar Renewable Energy Co. and an accomplice of the Biju Radhakrishnan in the Solar Scam.Saritha Nair Letter She was arrested on the complaint of one of the persons who she had defrauded, in Ambalapuzha She later requested the Economic Offences court where her case is being heard, that she wanted to give a secret statement, which would help to broaden the scope of the investigation. Her attorney, Fenny Balakrishnan termed the revelations as very crucial and capable of changing the direction of the investigation. She was released on bail in February 2014. Her name reappeared in the news after her scandal video was released and went viral on social media including WhatsApp on 12 October 2014. On 2015 June 2 her short film Anthyakoodasha was released on YouTube, which has crossed 500k views as on 18 May 2016 =Shalu Menon= Television and film actress Shalu Menon, a close associate of Biju Radhakrishnan, initially denied any knowledge or relationship with Biju Radhakrishnan. Photographs showing the two of them posing together or Biju handing over keys to a new vehicle she had purchased recently were explained away, on TV, as pictures taken at his request. Later, she came under the scanner of the Police and was arrested upon concluding that she was also an accomplice to the scam and had used her popularity to entice customers into parting with their money. She was released on bail in August 2013. =Tenny Joppan= Tenny, an aide and personal staff member of Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy was arrested on charges of cheating, for aiding Biju Radhakrishnan and Saritha for defrauding a businessman, Sreedharan Nair, to the tune of 40 Lakh Indian Rupees. He was released on bail in August 2013. =A. Firoze= A. Firoz, a government servant, surrendered himself on 18 July, after the court rejected his plea for anticipatory bail. He was accused of helping to dupe a builder of 4 million Rupees along with Biju and Saritha, by claiming one of them was an ADB official and they could arrange a contract with the ADB. He was suspended from service after his name surfaced as one of the accomplices of Biju. Phone call controversy At least four Kerala Cabinet ministers, three MLAs and hordes of government officials besides a junior Central Minister had been roped in by the women and their phone calls.  Allegations against the Chief Minister  Allegations against the Chief Minister Oommen Chandy have been raised, due to phone calls made by his personal staff and forged letters which were used by the fraudsters to defraud customers. The issue snowballed when Sridharan Nair, a quarry owner, claimed that he had met the Chief Minister, at his office, along with Saritha, during which the Chief Minister encouraged investments in renewable energy. The Chief Minister refuted these claims on the floor of the Assembly, stating that the only time he met Sridharan Nair was as a representative of Quarry owners. The allegations are being used by the opposition LDF as a reason to stall the proceedings of the Kerala Legislative Assembly and demand the resignation of the Kerala Chief Minister. Kerala secretariat siege Mounting pressure on Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to tender for a judicial investigation and thereby his resignation over the solar scam, the CPI (M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) on 12 August 2013, had conducted an indefinite, allegedly illegal siege on the state secretariat which lasted for 30 hours. The siege was addressed by Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) chief H.D Deve Gowda and CPI(M) General Secretary Prakash Karat. The activists of the LDF, who blocked three entry and exit gates of the Kerala Secretariat and claimed that the fourth will be blocked later in that day. The Left Democratic Front in Kerala had demanded a judicial investigation in the scam, which was later allowed by the government which led to the conclusion of the siege.

She sold much of her work through events such as Arts and Crafts Exhibition, Woman's Art Exhibition, Liberty's in London and, after 1924, Newlyn Art Gallery craft exhibitions. During the First World War, Ella Naper and Laura Knight collaborated on the design of several pieces of painted jewellery and enamel plaques, including Two Dancers (1912). In 1915, Naper and Knight exhibited several of these pieces in a joint exhibition, with Lamorna Birch, held at the London Fine Art Society. Naper received commissions for mayoral chains and war memorials, including one in Exeter Cathedral and also designed the memorial to the artist Benjamin Leader in St Buryan's Church. After 1919 Naper, together with Kate Westrup and Emily Westrup, ran the Lamorna Pottery, which continued in production until 1935. Naper was also a talented painter, often working in watercolours. She exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery on at least twenty-one occasions and also at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers and at Royal Society of British Artists. Naper was the subject of several paintings by other artists living in Lamorna, including her husband Charles Naper, Ruth Simpson, and Harold Knight. She is one of the models in Harold Harvey's painting The Critics (1922) and was also painted by, and produced some work with, Gluck. Naper features in several works by Laura Knight, including Spring (1916‚Äì1920) and is the model Knight is seen painting in Self Portrait with Nude (1913).

In the first half of the 20th century, the rise of mainstream feminism and the increased use of the concept in the later 20th century have reduced the concept to a standard item of pop culture fiction. Whether female characters are strong enough is often used as a gauge of story quality by critics, in a similar manner to whether the story passes the Bechdel test. However, some have criticized this metric for causing authors to avoid creating female characters with realistic weaknesses.  Traits  According to Carina Chocano, the strong female character has become a \\"cinematic clich√©\\", resulting in character archetypes like the \\"alpha professional\\" whose laser-like focus on career advancement has caused her to become a \\"grim, celibate automaton\\", and the \\"gloomy ninja with commitment issues\\". By this metric, the strong female character is a woman with the gendered behavior taken out. There is no clear consensus on the definition of \\"strong female character\\". Some believe it describes characters with powerful physical abilities, such as those of Buffy Summers or Katniss Everdeen. Others believe it to represent the quality of a character's \\"inner life\\" and their relative importance in the story. Criticism Despite the archetype arising largely through feminism, it has not been universally well received by those supportive of women's rights. Sophia McDougall of the New Statesman has criticized the high prevalence of strong female characters for creating a clich√© that represents women as unrealistically strong; she argues that the simplicity of this archetype does little to present women in media in a realistic, complex way. She points out that \\"Sherlock Holmes gets to be brilliant, solitary, abrasive, Bohemian, whimsical, brave, sad, manipulative, neurotic, vain, untidy, fastidious, artistic, courteous, rude, a polymath genius. Female characters get to be Strong\\". Carina Chocano from The New York Times has offered similar criticism for the \\"shorthand meme\\" of strong female characters; while she sees them as a \\"gateway drug\\" to realistic representation, she takes offense at the implication that female characters are \\"not interesting or worth identifying with\\" if they are cold, flawless, and masculine. In contrast, Alison Willmore of BuzzFeed takes issue with popular interpretation of the word \\"strong\\" rather than with the archetype itself; she prefers strong female characters in the sense of well-developed ones given a legitimate point of view over \\"badass\\" ones. Kelly Faircloth of the feminist blog Jezebel believes that strong female characters are not enough or required, but that women must have integral roles in the plot apart from helping men realize theirs (rather than, \\"seamlessly replace[able] with a floor lamp\\").

Cassius Parmensis came from that branch of the Roman gens Cassia, that played an important role in the founding of the city of Parma on the Via Aemilia in the second century BC. The ancient commentaries of Horace note that he was a follower of the teachings of Epicurus. In the spring of 44 BC Cassius Parmensis participated in the assassination of Caesar by members of the Senate. In 43 BC, following the murder, he became a quaestor and built a fleet which supported Gaius Cassius Longinus against Publius Cornelius Dolabella off the coast of the province of Asia. At the same time he wrote a report to Cicero from Cyprus on the situation, which has been handed down in the latter's correspondence.Cicero, Ad Familiares 12.13 In November of 43 Cassius Parmensis, like many other enemies of Caesar, was declared an outlaw (proscribed) by the triumvirate of Mark Antony, Octavian, and Lepidus. After the defeat of the party of the murderers of Caesar in the Battle of Philippi (autumn of 42 BC), he gathered the remaining military units and was able to bring himself and the undamaged fleet to safety for a while with Sextus Pompeius in Sicily. After the latter's defeat in the year 36 BC, he accompanied the fallen \\"naval king\\" to Asia Minor, in order to join Anthony during the final battles in Bithynia. Anthony and Octavian waged a propaganda attack with in part low blows and slanders which preceded the decisive military confrontation for autocratic rule in the Roman Empire. Cassius also took part with intense violent attacks against Caesar's heirs. He asserted that Octavian was of low descent,Suetonius, Augustus 4. and was only named his heir due to a homosexual relationship with Caesar. Furthermore, he said that Octavian had wanted to make his only daughter Julia the consort of the rich but \\"barbarous\\" nobleman Koson of Dacia.Michael Grant, Cleopatra, 1998, p. 261 In 31 BC, Cassius Parmensis fought under Anthony's command at the Battle of Actium. His flight from Octavian's revenge lasted a total of twelve years (which was longer than that of all the other conspirators) but after the fall of Anthony he finally lost every possibility of fleeing, since the adopted son of Caesar now ruled the entire Roman Empire. After the defeat at Actium, he fled to Athens, where, in 30 B.C. at the very latest, he was recognized as the last murderer of Caesar still living and was killed by Lucius Varus under Octavian's orders. As an author, Cassius Parmensis wrote tragedies, satires, elegies and epigrams, which, in Horace's opinion, were not insignificant. Unfortunately, none of his work has survived. We only know the titles of two tragedies, Thyestes and Brutus, the first of which was allegedly stolen by his murderer Varus. Thyestes was subsequently published as Varus's own work. The style of his letter to Cicero seems above all complicated and pedantic in its flatteries, but also demonstrates a good talent for military observation. As for the common assertion often referring to another location in Horace, that Cassius had been burned to death together with his works, it is probably a mix-up. Marcus Terentius Varro quotes a verse of Cassius;Marcus Terentius Varro, On the Latin Language 7.72. however, the same verse is also attributed in another place to the poet Lucius Accius:Marcus Terentius Varro, On the Latin Language 6.7 :Nocte intempesta nostram devenit domum :[Late at night he came into our home] References Category:Ancient Roman dictators Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Ancient Roman politicians Category:Ancient Roman writers Category:Assassinated Roman politicians Category:Golden Age Latin writers Parmensis, Gaius Category:Latin-language writers Category:People from Rome Category:1st-century BC historians Category:1st-century BC Romans Category:1st-century BC writers Category:Senators of the Roman Republic Category:Roman Republican praetors Category:Assassins of Julius Caesar Category:70s BC births Category:30s BC deaths Category:Executed ancient Roman people ","title":"Gaius Cassius Parmensis"},{"id":"40186106","text":"The Phenomenal Nora Aunor is the last non Holiday studio album by Filipino singer-actress Nora Aunor,of 1970 released by Alpha Records Corporation in the Philippines in LP format and later released in 1999 in a compilation/ cd format.

The \\"culture of popular laughter is a cultural-historical term coined by the literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin in his book Rabelais and His World (1965). This studied popular culture in Renaissance Europe through the themes of Fran√ßois Rabelais' book Gargantua and Pantagruel (1532‚Äì64). The idea of the culture of popular laughter combines two literary ideas developed by Bakhtin in the same work: \\"grotesque realism\\" and \\"carnivalesque\\" which examined, respectively, the celebration of primary needs and the idea of carnival in which social norms were subverted. The culture of popular laughter was originally formulated based on the writings of Rabelais, but has also been applied in the interpretation of peasant scenes painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and his descendants. The example has also been applied to Japanese society. Carnivalesque The idea of \\"carnivalesque\\" coined by Bakhtin also forms part of his wider theory of popular laughter. He argued that, during times of carnival such as the Feast of Fools, social norms were deliberately inverted. The carnival then became a form of \\"safety-valve\\" institution, which served a structural-functionalist role to temporarily release stresses in the contemporary social system. Bakhtin, however, argued that this form of system was \\"formalized\\" in the culture of the period as \\"popular laughter\\". Relevance The historian G√°bor Klaniczay argued that \\"popular laughter\\" stretched through all echelons of society and was not restricted to the peasantry. Bakhtin's theory has also been credited with bringing about a scholarly reassessment of the importance of popular culture in history.

The company has four boats: the river launch Tower Belle, narrowboat Redshank, glass-topped Bagheera and locally built Flower of Bristol. The company also has an interest in Bristol Hydrogen Boats which has commissioned and built a hydrogen powered ferry boat. History The Bristol Packet was founded in 1973 by Nick and Corrina Gray. At that time there were no passenger boats operating in the city docks or on the river Avon, the last services had been offered by the Kingstonian in the 1960s. The docks were semi-derelict and there were few visitors. Trips were initially offered around the docks on the narrowboat Redshank, which along with her accompanying butty Greenshank, had been brought from the Midlands by the Grays. Nick offered \\"interesting, anecdotal commentaries which added some depth and interest to the trips\\", according to the Bristol Post. In 1976 the river launch Tower Belle was brought to Bristol enabling trips upstream to Hanham and downstream to the Avon Gorge. Avon Gorge trips had not been available to the public since the demise of P & A Campbells in the 1970s. The Grays eventually sold the company in 1980. Tickets for boat trips were sold from a 1910 showman's wagon at Wapping Wharf. In 1995, The Bristol Packet commenced operations on the Flower of Bristol, enabling a further extension of the evening charter business. The most recent addition, in 2002, to the company's fleet was Amsterdam built sightseeing boat Bagheera.

It was one of the states established after the decay of the Kievan Rus', and in the 13th century Tver rivaled the Principality of Moscow and aimed to become the center of the united Russian state. Eventually it lost, decayed, and in 1485 was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The principality was located approximately in the area currently occupied by Tver Oblast and the eastern part of Smolensk Oblast of Russia. The capital of the principality was Tver. History Execution of Mikhail at the Golden Horde, by Vasily Vereshchagin. In the 1230s or the 1240s, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich, the Grand Prince of Vladimir, detached the city of Tver from Principality of Pereyaslavl-Zalessky where it previously belonged and gave it to his son Alexander Nevsky. In 1246, another son of Yaroslav, Yaroslav of Tver, became the Prince of Tver, and the principality was ruled by his descendants until 1485, when it was abolished. In 1264, Yaroslav was appointed the Grand Prince of Vladimir, which at the time meant he was the supreme authority of all north-western Russia. In the 13th century, Principality of Tver was less dependent from the Golden Horde than other Russian principalities were, and its population grew up. The combination of these two factors led to the rivalry between Tver and Moscow, each of which were trying to become the most influential Russian principality. In 1285, Mikhail of Tver, a son of Yaroslav of Tver, succeeded his father and became the Prince of Tver. In 1305 he became the Grand Prince of Vladimir as well, however, √ñz Beg Khan of the Golden Horde decided that Tver became too strong, and supported Moscow against Tver. Mikhail was summoned to the Golden Horde and executed there in 1318. His son and successor, Dmitry of Tver, was executed in the Golden Horde in 1326, and another son and also a prince of Tver, Aleksandr Mikhailovich of Tver, was executed there in 1339 as well together with his son Fyodor. In 1327, there was an anti-Tatar uprising in Principality of Tver, which was suppressed. The city of Tver was burned down, and the principality lost a considerable part of its population. Tver never recovered from that, and eventually Moscow, which managed to remain on good terms with Tatars, absorbed all surrounding principalities and eventually became the capital of Russia. In the 14th century, some parts of the principality were temporarily given away as appanage. This created the whole system of principalities dependent on Tver. These included Principality of Kashin, Principality of Kholm, and Principality of Zubtsov. Some of them became independent to the point that they conducted war with Tver. In 1371, Mikhail II of Tver was the last Prince of Tver ever appointed the Grand Prince of Vladimir. The reign of Mikhail is usually considered as the last period when Tver was still could rival Moscow and oppose the Golden Horde. He sided with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania against Moscow, which eventually led to all Russian princes starting war against Tver in 1375. Mikhail lost and had to recognize the supremacy of the Grand Prince of Moscow, at the time Dmitry Donskoy. Whereas he managed to gain full independence for Tver shortly afterwards, Principality of Tver never was able to rival Moscow again. In the 1470s, Mikhail III of Tver had to sign a number of treaties with Moscow (Ivan III of Russia) which essentially discriminated Tver. When he tried to compensate the treaties by seeking an alliance with Lithuania, the army of Ivan III swiftly conquered Tver in 1485. The principality was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

Life Ang√©lique Arvanitaki was of Greek origin and was born in Cairo on 11 July 1901. In 1942, she married Nick Chalazonitis, who was a student in veterinary medicine at the time,http://hssm.semel.ucla.edu/projects/oral-histories-neuroscientists http://hssm.semel.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/Alcmene%20Chalazonitis%20Columbia.pdf and would himself become a neurophysiologist too. Their daughter Alcmene Chalazonitis, born in 1943, later also became a neuroscientist.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alcmene_Chalazonitis Research Arvanitaki contributed to the field of neurophysiology with research that explored the giant nerve fibres in genera of gastropods, the sea hare Aplysia and the land snail Helix. She developed the concept of ganglion preparation of large identifiable nerves. Arvanitaki also discovered that regular electrical oscillations could periodically grow in size until a series of action potentials were fired along isolated nerve fibres of the cuttlefish, genus Sepia. A further contribution of Arvanitaki was the demonstration that a neuronal circuit was not required for a single nerve to produce rhythmic and spontaneous activity. Also, she discovered that when two nerve fibres are close in proximity, the activity of a single nerve fibre can generate activity in a nearby nerve fibre. Arvanitaki and her husband Chalazonitis both explored the methodology of electrophysiological activity of the nervous system of the sea hare genus Aplysia. In 1955, Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis as well as Ladislav Tauc created the first intracellular recordings of large neurons of the California sea hare. Arvanitaki's and Chalazonitis' explored photoexcitability of certain neurons. Arvanitaki's work was, however, overshadowed by Hodgkin and Huxley's work on the giant axon of the squid.

It is one of the largest rainforest organizations in the world, and collaborates with around 70 local and national environmental, indigenous and human rights organizations in 7 rainforest countries in the Amazon region, Central Africa and Southeast Asia. The organization works to support people in securing their rights and increase people's level of commitment to rainforest protection; to prevent policy and business interests from contributing to the destruction of the rainforest; and to consolidate policy and practice that serve to protect it. RFN engages in advocacy work in key international processes concerning rainforest issues. Rainforest Foundation Norway was founded in 1989, and is today one of Europe's leading organizations within the field of rainforest protection. It forms part of the Rainforest Foundation network, with independent sister organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom: the Rainforest Foundation US and the Rainforest Foundation UK. RFN is a foundation, and its operations are funded by public authorities, as well as private donors, international funds and sponsors.  History  Rainforest Foundation Norway was founded in 1989, following the formation of the Rainforest Foundation the same year by Sting and his wife Trudie Styler after the leader of the indigenous Kayapo people of Brazil, Chief Raoni, made a personal request to them that they help his community protect its lands and culture. RFN at that time comprised the Norwegian branch of the international Rainforest Foundation network. In 1996, it became an independent foundation, with five Norwegian member organizations. From the organisation's inception, the executive director was Lars L√∏vold until March 2018, except from the years 2013-2014 when Dag Hareide was leading the organisation. From March 2018, √òyvind Eggen is the Secretary General.  Approach to rainforest protection  Rainforest Foundation Norway espouses a rights-based approach to rainforest protection. Its approach is founded on the notion that the peoples who for generations have developed their cultures and societies in balanced interaction with the highly complex yet vulnerable ecosystems of the rainforest have fundamental rights to these areas. In order to attain its goal of implementing rights-based rainforest management in significant rainforest areas in all 12 countries where RFN and its partners are active, RFN supports programs and projects in cooperation with local organizations, indigenous peoples, and traditional populations of the rainforest. It also seeks changes in the policies and practices of governments, intergovernmental bodies, and private enterprises; and to generate and strengthen national and international public awareness and action. In addition, the organization has adopted an approach that emphasizes the strengthening of civil society as an important goal in the countries in which it is active. On this basis, it has prioritized building long-term partnerships with local and national organizations that share its key objectives, as well as supporting the development of representative indigenous associations and community-based organizations.  Programs  With its goal of preserving the rainforest, Rainforest Foundation Norway advocates for the rights of its indigenous inhabitants, by providing project-related grants, capacity-building expertise and direct technical assistance to its local partners on the ground, including indigenous communities and grassroots organizations. In addition to working with these groups directly through program activities in local communities, RFN support them indirectly through policy, advocacy, and information activities aimed at securing rights, establishing indigenous territories and protecting the rainforest.

The present building was constructed some time in the 16th century.Ministry of Culture: Domaine du ch√¢teau de Canisy (√©galement sur commune de Saint-Gilles) It is located about from Paris and from Saint-L√¥, in the center of Normandy. The ch√¢teau is surrounded by 740 acres of forests, ponds, lakes, gardens and manicured lawns. Members of the Kergorlay family have owned the estate for the past 1,000 years. The ownership of the ch√¢teau has been passed down to the oldest male heir in the family since the time it was built. At the present time, Comte Denis de Kergolay is the presiding owner of the Ch√¢teau de Canisy.  History  =Construction= In 1066, the Lord of Canisy was Hugues de Carbonnel. At that time there was a medieval castle on the grounds and a fortified tower; only a portion of these remain. The present Ch√¢teau de Canisy was mainly constructed between 1558 and 1625 during the time that Herve de Carbonnel was presiding owner of the estate. He commissioned the architect Fran√ßois Gabriel to oversee the renovation. Local stone used on the exterior of the ch√¢teau has a purple hue, which at times appears to change color in the sunlight. The ch√¢teau has parapets and towers which were typical of the architectural design of that era. At one time the ch√¢teau was surrounded by a moat, which has since been filled in. =Second World War= In 1940, German soldiers took over the ch√¢teau and occupied it until August 1944. During that time, Brigitte de Kergorlay, daughter of the heir of the castle, was the translator between the German forces and her father, who spoke fluent German, but refused to speak to the German soldiers at all. The surrounding commune of Canisy was part of the aerial saturation bombing that was launched by the United States First Army led by General Omar Bradley. During the battle on 26 July 1944, the commune was liberated when Bradley pushed his troops through the German lines. This was known as Operation Cobra, which had a goal of creating a passage for the Allies to get from Normandy to Brittany. After liberation, the Ch√¢teau de Canisy was used as a hospital for wounded Allied soldiers. =Restorations= During the occupation of the ch√¢teau by the German forces and the ensuing battles accompanying the landing of the Allies, there was severe damage to the structure. Since that time, the ch√¢teau has undergone several restorations. During the one thousand years this castle and the surrounding grounds have been owned by the Kergorlay family, some changes have been made to make life in the estate more modern and convenient, while maintaining as much as possible of its original architectural heritage. It has been listed since 1945 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Today The Kergorlay family has opened the Ch√¢teau de Canisy as a historical ch√¢teau, hotel and event venue. Rooms in the castle are decorated with furniture accumulated by the various Kergorlay owners throughout history, to represent specific time periods. Inside the castle there is also a library which contains many rare and collectable books.

It was rediscovered at the start of the twentieth century by the art historian Roberto Longhi, who identified it with the painting recorded as La notte in 1607. Produced in around three months for the church of saint Philip Neri in Fermo, its chiaroscuro is in the style of Caravaggio, who Rubens had got to know in Rome during the Flemish painter's ten years' study in Italy. The painting is also heavily influenced by Correggio's La Notte. It is now held at the Pinacoteca civica in Fermo. It shows the shepherds reaching the stable of the Nativity, with the Virgin Mary showing the baby Jesus to the shepherds, four swirling angels holding up a scroll announcing Jesus's birth and with St Joseph, two female figures and two male figures in the left background. It has recently been suggested that the elderly female figure can be identified with the disbelieving midwife of the Gospel of James, raising her hands to heaven as she is cured.

Measles in childhood left her partially deaf. She was educated at James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich, where one of her teachers was the well-known botanist Dr Lilian Clarke.Amanda Thomas \\"Dr.Winifred Brenchley, O.B.E. (1883‚Äì1953)\\". Retrieved 29 July 2013. She attended Swanley Horticultural College for two years, completing her course in 1903. At the school, the new science-based study provided an alternative to the earlier emphasis on practical apprenticeship training, thus opening up male-dominated horticultural trades to women. By 1903 the college was only taking women students, with the aim of providing suitable occupations for unmarried women. (There was also a growing demand for horticulturalists and agriculturalists in the British colonies and it was felt that women were suited to this role.) Brenchley won the Royal Horticultural Society Silver Gilt medal but gave up gardening to study botany.Donald L. Opitz (2013) 'A Triumph of Brains over Brute': Women and Science at the Horticultural College, Swanley, 1890‚Äì1910. Isis 104(1) pp 30‚Äì62 She received her BSc from University College London in 1905, where she studied under Francis Wall Oliver. She was awarded a Gilchrist Scholarship for postgraduate study for 1906-7 and was awarded a DSc from the University of London in 1911 for her thesis: On the strength and development of the grain of wheat (Triticum vulgare).University of London Library Catalogue She became a Fellow of University College in 1914.  Career  Brenchley working in her laboratory at leftThe Gilchrist Scholarship took her to Rothamsted Experimental Station in Harpenden. She was the first woman to work there in the 60 years of the laboratories' existence, and it was admitted that she was appointed 'because the funds available would not have attracted a suitable man'.Sir E J Russell 'A History of Agricultural Science in Great Britain 1620‚Äì1954' London, Allen & Unwin, 1966 p.235 At Rothamsted, where she was the only woman, a tradition of afternoon tea was established as it was considered appropriate for her by the rest of the male staff. It was this afternoon tea and a later woman scientist, Muriel Bristol, that inspired the famous work of R.A. Fisher, Lady tasting tea, on applying permutations in experiments. The quality of her work was soon apparent and after a year she became a permanent employee as head of the Botany Department, a post she held until her retirement at 65. Early on at Rothamsted, she demonstrated her technical skills, improving the technique for growing plants in water culture and coming close to discovering the essential role of copper and zinc in plant nutrition, as detailed in her book Inorganic Plant Poisons and Stimulents (1914, revised 1927). Katherine Warington's discovery of boron's role as a micronutrient in 1923Warington, K. (1923) \\"The effect of boric acid and borax on the broad bean and certain other plants\\". Annals of Botany 37 pp. 629‚Äì672 and the subsequent investigations into the effects of boron is perhaps the best-known work from her laboratory. Her other chief interest was in the ecology of weeds and in Weeds of Farmland (1920) she produced the first comprehensive scientific study of weeds in the UK. Her work on the permanent Park Grass plots at Rothamsted resulted in another book Manuring of Grass Land for Hay (1924) describing how lime and fertilizers affect the botanical composition of grasslands. Brenchley was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1910. In 1920, she became a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society. She was closely associated with A D Imms with whom she collected in the field. Her main entomological interest was in the Lepidoptera.The Remarks (on Fellows who have died in the year 1953) Proceedings of the Royal Entomological Society C 18 p.79 She was awarded the OBE in 1948, the year she retired.  Later life  In retirement, Brenchley returned to her gardening. She was also bringing together the vast quantities of unpublished material in her research notebooks, but she suffered a severe stroke and died in Harpenden on 27 October 1953.

During the depression of the 1890s combined with falling wool prices and drought many of the properties in the area including Corona, Sturts Meadows, Mount Arrowsmith, Langwirra, Elsinora and Thurloo Downs fell into the hands of finance companies. Corona was acquired by Goldsbrough Mort & Co Ltd. The Corona Pastoral Company sold the property in 1911 to Messrs. T. L. Browne and H. H. Dutton. The station was stocked at this time with a flock of 60,000 sheep, 280 cattle and 190 horses. In 1912 when shearing was in full swing the men went on strike over a butter allowance which was not resolved until an AWU representative travelled to Corona to settle the strike. Sidney Kidman acquired the property in 1917. In 1925 Corona had a flock of over 42,000 sheep. In the 1930s leases in the area were adjusted to give owners financial certainty so long as part of the lease was surrendered. Kidman did not exercise this option and the leasehold remained the same. Fowler's Gap, which now operates as a research station, was once an out-station of Corona until 1947 when it was resumed and became a station in its own right. In 1995 the property was fully stocked with 13,000 head of sheep. Soft Rolling Skin sheep were introduced to Corona in 2001 by Peter and Tracy Botten who owned the station at the time. In the drought of 2002 the flock was down to about 300. By 2005 the wool price of over 200 a bale more than previous years and the flock was approximately 6,500. In 2013 the station was still owned by the owned by Bottens who were running 7,000 sheep on the property. Corona was awarded organic certification earlier the same year. It was gained in just two years rather than the normal three, because the Bottens had not used chemicals for the previous three years prior to starting certification. As a result, the wool clip attained prices or up to 1 per kilogram of wool and were fetching up to 1,050 per bale.

He and his army, which consisted of about 3 000 men, led by Nils Stiernsk√∂ld and Herman Wrangel, had burned the city of V√§ and 24 parishes within G√∂inge and Villands district. On the night of 10‚Äì11 February 1612 the king and a small force were in Vittsj√∂. In the morning, the Danes attacked and the king and his entourage fled north past Vittsj√∂ sconce towards Drags√•n (now Verums√•n or Vie√•n). The bridge over the river was held by Danes so the king was forced to try to cross by riding over the ice. The ice broke and the king and his horse fell into the water. The king (but not his horse) was rescued by the horsemen Thomas Larsson and Per Ban√©r, who himself got into the water and was rescued by his younger brother Nils Ban√©r. In 1912 a memorial was raised to commemorate the battle. The inscription on the memorial reads in full: \\"Minne af konung Gustaf II Adolfs r√§ddning i Wittsj√∂ den 11 februari 1612 af ryttaren Thomas Larsson\\" (in English \\"Memory of King Gustavus Adolphus' rescue in Wittsj√∂ February 11, 1612 by the horseman Thomas Larsson\\") Those who died in the action were buried in a mass grave. It was long forgotten, but was recovered as a result of the digging of a trench in 1959 not more than 100 meters from the previously-raised memorial stone.  Sources  * Slaget i Vittsj√∂ 1612.
