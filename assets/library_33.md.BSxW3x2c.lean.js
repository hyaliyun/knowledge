It is endemic to a small portion of the Santa Cruz Mountains in California. Background and description The Zayante band- winged grasshopper is in the Order Orthoptera and Family Acrididae. It is known to be located only in Santa Cruz County, California within the Zayante sandhills, chiefly within a Maritime Coast Range Ponderosa Pine forest. The area has little vegetation and is primarily made up of sand and soil sediments. The male grasshoppers range from 13.7 to 17.2 millimeters in length, and females a little larger from 19.7 to 21.6 millimeters. (Donald J. Barry. 2000). They have forewings that are tan to gray with darker bands, pale yellow hind wings, with one faint thin band that is visible when they are in flight; its eyes are also banded. Its lower legs (tibiae) are blue and gray (Donald J. Barry 2000). They have good flying skills, being known to fly distances of three to seven feet. They produce a buzzing sound while flying in order to avoid predators. The Zyante band-winged grasshoppers are similar in appearance to many of the other species of grasshoppers; the only difference is that they are found specifically in a distinct range of habit in the sandhills. The grasshoppers have a flight season that lasts from late May to October, their peak activities being around July and August. (Donald J. Barry. 2000). Habitat A shallow sea once covered California's Central Valley and when the Santa Cruz Mountains formed, sand from the ocean floor was uplifted and created the sandhills ecosystem. The Zayante sandhills habitat supports plants and animals that are found nowhere else. It is one of the rarest ecosystems of California, and one of the rarest of the United States. The Zayante sandhills ecosystem is not only home to the endangered Zayante band- winged grasshopper, but also to other unique species, many of which are on the endangered species list, including the Mount Hermon June beetle, Santa Cruz wallflower, Ben Lomond buckwheat, Bonny Doon manzanita, Ben Lomond spineflower, and the Santa Cruz kangaroo rat (Donald J. Barry 2000). Threats and Management Plans The Zayante band-winged grasshopper (Trimertropis infantilis) has been listed as an endangered species. The main threat to the species is habitat loss. The introduction of non-native plant species of plants has also impacted the grasshopper populations. Over-collection and pesticides have been identified as potential threats (Donald J. Barry 2000). The loss of habitat is caused by urban development, agriculture, and sand mining. A large percentage of the Zayante sandhills have already been altered by these activities (USFWS 1997). Non-native species are taking over the sand hills, crowding out native species and degrading the grasshopper habitat. Two non-native species in particular, Portuguese broom and sea fig are significantly impacting the remaining ecosystem (Donald J. Barry 2000). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated critical habitats within the communities of Mount Hermon, Felton, Ben Lomond, Zayante, and Scotts Valley (10,560 acres) (Donald J. Barry 2000). Two Habitat Conservation Plans have been implemented by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (Joseph E. Doddridge 2001). Almost two thirds of the remaining habitat is unprotected and privately owned (Glenn, C. R. 2006), complicating efforts to protect the threatened species.

It is found in most of Africa, in the Middle East, in the Arabian Peninsula and southern Europe. These insects are called dropwings because of their habit of immediately lowering their wings after landing on a perch. Males of this species are violet-red with red veins in the wings while females are yellow and brown. Both sexes have red eyes. Subspecies The following subspecies are recognised as valid: *T. a. annulata (Palisot de Beauvois, 1807) *T. a. haematina (Rambur, 1842) *T. a. scorteccii Nielsen, 1936 Description Trithemis annulata is a robust medium-sized species with a wingspan of . The mature male has a dark red head and a yellow labium with brown central spot. The eyes are red with white spots on the rear edge, and the frons is dark metallic purplish-red. The prothorax is violet with slightly darker longitudinal stripes. The membranous wings have distinctive red veins, the pterostigma is orange-brown and there is a large orange-brown splash at the base of the hind wings. The abdomen is fairly broad and is pinkish-violet, with purple markings on the top of each segment and blackish markings on the terminal three segments. Females are a similar size to males but the thorax is brownish and the abdomen is yellow with dark brown markings. The wings of females lack the red veins of males but have similar orange-brown patches. It is very similar in appearance to the red-veined dropwing (Trithemis arteriosa), but that species has a more slender abdomen and a wedge-shaped black area on either side of the tip of the abdomen. Distribution Trithemis annulata is found in most of Africa and also in France, Cyprus, Greece, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mauritius, Oman, Portugal, Qatar, R√©union, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. It was also recorded in the Maltese islands in 2005 and found breeding there in 2007.Sciberras, A.; Sciberras, J. and Magro D. (2007) \\"A Celebration of Dragonflies\\". The Malta Independent. November 19, pp. 8‚Äì9. With the advent of global warming, it is increasing its range northwards in Europe and in the late 1990s advanced from southern Spain and southern Italy into France, and from Greece and Turkey into Central Europe. One such place where it has become established is the floodplain of the River Ebro in northeastern Spain. Ecology Trithemis annulata is an adaptable species, and the adults are able to tolerate a range of habitats including semi-arid rangeland. They can be seen flying near sluggish rivers, in marshes and also beside still-water ponds. They are sometimes seen in brackish water habitats, although it is unclear whether they actually breed in salty water. The larvae develop rapidly, so these dragonflies are able to make use of temporary water bodies for breeding. Males are often to be seen perching on the twigs of waterside shrubs and on rocks in the sunshine, but in the evening or when the sun is obscured, they move into trees. The female T. annulata is thought to deposit her eggs by flying over the surface and dipping the tip of her abdomen in the water. The larvae develop in water where they are aggressive predators. The adults are also predators, using their excellent eyesight to detect prey and their legs to hold and carry their victims. Status Trithemis annulata is a very common species throughout its wide range which includes most of Africa, the Mediterranean area, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East. Although it may be threatened locally by habitat loss, in general it seems to be thumb increasing in abundance, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern.

USCGC Icarus (WPC-110) was a steel-hulled, diesel- powered Thetis-class patrol boat of the United States Coast Guard that patrolled the Eastern coast during World War II. In 1942, Icarus sank the off the coast of North Carolina and took its survivors into custody as prisoners of war. U-352 was the second World War II U-boat sunk by the United States in American waters, and the first one from which survivors were taken. was the first World War II U-boat sunk by U.S. coastal defenses; there were no survivors. Built by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, Icarus was delivered on 29 March 1932 and commissioned on 1 April 1932. After a shakedown cruise, she reported to the New York Division's Special Patrol Force, where she supported the Coast Guard's efforts against rum-runners until Prohibition ended in 1933, continuing after that to perform general law enforcement duties and rescue patrols. In November 1941, with World War II nearly two years underway, the Coast Guard was transferred from the U.S. Treasury Department to the U.S. Navy. Germany declared war on the U.S. on 11 December 1941, and Icarus was rearmed and assigned to the Eastern Sea Frontier for patrol duty off the East Coast. German U-boats quickly became a serious threat on the East Coast, sinking approximately 80 ships between January and April 1942, with U.S. defenses only managing to sink one U-boat () during that period. U-352 incident While in Torpedo Alley, off the coast of Cape Lookout en route to Key West on 9 May 1942, Icarus picked up a contact on sonar, and a torpedo exploded nearby. Icarus anticipated the presumed U-boat's next move and dropped 5 depth charges at the site of the prior torpedo explosion. As sonar picked up a moving target again, Icarus moved to intercept, dropping two more depth charges, apparently hitting their target as bubbles were seen rising to the surface. Passing the spot again, Icarus dropped three more charges. Shortly thereafter, surfaced, and Icarus opened fire with machine guns and prepared for a ramming maneuver. When the U-boat's crew abandoned ship, Icarus ceased fire, releasing one last depth charge over U-352 as it sank beneath the water. The only U-boat previously sunk on the East Coast had gone down with all hands, and there were no standing orders concerning the rescue of survivors. Icarus had to call both Norfolk and Charleston before receiving authorization to pick up U-352s survivors.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGeRDFImSeU Forty minutes after the incident, Icarus picked up 33 of its crew, including U-352's commander, Kapit√§nleutnant Hellmut Rathke, and delivered them to the Commandant of the 6th Naval District at Charleston Navy Yard the next day. For his actions in sinking U-352, Lieutenant Maurice D. Jester, commander of the Icarus, was awarded the Navy Cross.DAVID AND GOLIATH: The ICARUS And THETIS Battle German U-boats, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office, Accessed August 16, 2007.

Later service Rearmed at Norfolk Navy Yard, Icarus resumed her duties as a convoy escort, anti-submarine patroller and search and rescue ship. She was transferred to the 3rd Naval District for duty with the Air-Sea Rescue Service in 1945. On 18 October 1946 she was placed on reserve status at Stapleton, Staten Island. Icarus was decommissioned on 15 March 1948 and sold on 1 July 1948 to the Southeastern Terminal and Steamship Company. She was later transferred to the Navy of the Dominican Republic where she was renamed Independencia (P-105, later P-204). She saw combat in the Dominican Civil War in 1965, was rebuilt in 1975, and was later sent to reserve. Independencia was still listed by Jane's Fighting Ships as part of the Dominican Navy as late as 1995, but had been dropped from the list by the 1999 release.

The head of the Sri Lanka Post is the Postmaster General, currently Ranjith Ariyaratne. Assisting in administration there is a deputy Postmaster General in every province. Sri Lanka Post employs more than 22,000 employees in various positions to staff and support the 4738 post offices across the country. History A public postbox in Kandy Sri Lanka Post has a long history of 222 years, dating back to 1798, when the colonial Dutch rulers started five post offices in the Maritime Districts under their control. In 1799, they published the first postal regulations and postage rates. The Dutch East India Company operated the Postal service, which was not meant for the public but for official use. Sri Lanka Post, \\"Heritage\\", on line. The British took control of the country in 1815, when E. Bletterman was the Postmaster General for the whole island. Mr. Lewis Sansoni succeeded Bletterman as the second Postmaster General in 1817. The third Postmaster General was Major G. Stewart, who extended the postal services to major towns in the country. They re-organised the postal service and others eventually established a permanent Post Office in Colombo in 1882. Postage stamps The only evidence of a British postal service before 1815 is a \\"Colombo Post Free\\" handstamp used on a soldier's letter in 1809, when British Royal Artillery troops were engaged to subdue Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the king of Kandy (1798‚Äì1815), whose inland territory had never been under the influence of the Dutch.Robson Lowe, Encyclopedia of British Empire Postage Stamps, 1775‚Äì1950, v. III, p. 93, and illustrated on p. 97. The first adhesive stamps (the six-pence purple-brown stamps on blued paper) were issued on 1 April 1857, seventeen years after Britain had introduced the adhesive postage stamp to the world. The first stamps in local denominations of rupees and cents were issued on 1 February 1892. The General Post Office The General Post Office was housed in different places in Colombo. By 1895 it acquired its own building, opposite the Governor General's residence - the Queens's House on Queen's Street, currently the Janadhipath Mawatha (President's Street). During the disturbances in the country, the GPO was moved out of its former building and into the present Postal Headquarters. The new building, consisting of 9 floors of modern facilities, is the center of operations and administration. The Postal Museum, too, is housed in this building. Transportation Over the years, different modes of transport have been used for the transportation and delivery of mail. In a bygone era, delivery was first by foot (in the hills and remote places it is not uncommon to see postmen delivering letters on foot, even today!), then bicycles were added. Sri Lanka Post was the first to inaugurate a mail coach service in Asia. The mail coach service began operations in 1832, between Colombo and Kandy. Gaveshaka, \\"Our Heritage\\", Colombo, Sunday Times Online, v. 1, No. 36 (4 Feb. 2007). This was extended between Galle and Colombo in 1838. The year 1892 saw the first \\"Travelling Post Office\\" doing its run between Colombo and Peradeniya, a suburb of Kandy. \\"Bedford\\" vans made in England were used, even during the '70s. Today Sri Lanka Post uses a fleet of Japanese vehicles painted in the traditional red. During the '50s and '60s postmen on British made BSA - Bantam motorcycles were a familiar sight. When the postman's beat becoming smaller in the cities, the motorcycles gave way to the bicycles. The mails are carried today by railway, public and private omni-buses, and the department's fleet of vehicles.

It was recognised by the Real Sociedad Canina in 1911, but by the 1960s was believed to be extinct. Efforts to recover the breed began in 1979; a breed standard was published by the government of Navarre in 2006, and in 2010 the Pach√≥n was added to the list of dog breeds recognised by the Spanish government. It is one of five Basque breeds of dog, the others being the Basque Shepherd Dog, the , the Villano de Las Encartaciones and the Villanuco de Las Encartaciones. A few examples display an unusual characteristic, a split or bifid nose.  History  Pach√≥n navarro (c. 1890) The F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale and other major international kennel clubs do not recognize the Pach√≥n as a standardized breed. The Spanish Kennel Club has accepted the Pach√≥n as a breed. The variety is thought to have descended from the Talbot hound and other hounds, originating in the 12th century. It is likely related to the Old Spanish Pointer, which it resembles in appearance. The Pach√≥n is believed to have reached its apex of popularity among Spanish nobility of the 18th and 19th centuries, becoming nearly extinct after the Spanish Civil War. A few enthusiasts scoured the country and have re-established breeding stock. In 2009 the total breed population was estimated to be between 700 and 1000 dogs.  Description  The modern Pach√≥n is a braque-type hunting dog which points to game. It has short hair that may be brown and white, or orange and white, commonly ticked like the coat of most German Shorthaired Pointers. The head and large patches on the coat are generally solid-colored.

Technique With the patient lying down on their back on an examination table or exam floor, the examiner lifts the patient's leg while the knee is straight. A variation is to lift the leg while the patient is sitting. However, this reduces the sensitivity of the test. In order to make this test more specific, the ankle can be dorsiflexed and the cervical spine flexed. This increases the stretching of the nerve root and dura. Interpretation If the patient experiences sciatic pain, and more specifically pain radiating down the leg (radiculopathy), when the straight leg is at an angle of between 30 and 70 degrees, then the test is positive and a herniated disk is a possible cause of the pain. A negative test suggests a likely different cause for back pain. A positive straight leg test reproduces radiating leg pain. If it only causes back pain, then the test is negative. Because this is often misunderstood, it is prudent to add a statement of clarification. For example, \\"Straight leg test is positive on the left, reproducing the patient's radiating leg symptoms.\\" A meta-analysis reported the accuracy as: * sensitivity 91% * specificity 26% If raising the opposite leg causes pain (cross or contralateral straight leg raising): * sensitivity 29% * specificity 88% Las√®gue's sign Las√®gue's sign was named after Charles Las√®gue (1816-1883). In 1864 Las√®gue described the signs of developing low back pain while straightening the knee when the leg has already been lifted. In 1880 Serbian doctor Laza Lazareviƒá described the straight leg raise test as it is used today, so the sign is often named Lazareviƒá's sign in Serbia and some other countries.Lazareviƒáev znak See also * Femoral nerve stretch test References Category:Symptoms and signs: Nervous system Category:Medical signs Category:Musculoskeletal examination ","title":"Straight leg raise"},{"id":"12713637","text":"Umma saphirina is a species of damselfly in the family Calopterygidae.

Schalk was born in Vienna, Austria, and together with younger brother Franz, was a student of composer Anton Bruckner (1824‚Äì1896), and a friend of composer Hugo Wolf (1860‚Äì1903). He was a prominent figure in Viennese musical life of the late nineteenth-century, a vocal advocate for the music of Wagner, Bruckner and Wolf: in this capacity he was opposed to the more conservative supporters of Brahms who were led by the critic Eduard Hanslick. As president of the Vienna Wagner Society, Schalk was active in arranging performances of Bruckner's work: he also popularized his teacher's music by arranging it for piano performance, writing articles and arranging for its publication. Jackson, p. xii He played a comparable role in popularizing Wolf's music. Bruckner is said to have referred to him as Herr Generalissimus. Schalk was involved in the preparation of several of Bruckner's scores for their first publication or performance: these include the ThirdHorton, p. 12 and EighthHorton, p. 84 symphonies, along with the Mass in F Minor. in Jackson (1997). Schalk wrote a series of articles under the collective title Das Gesetz der Tonalit√§t (\\"the foundation of tonality\\") which laid down his theory of harmony, based on his teaching from Bruckner.Watson, p. 122 He was later a professor at the Vienna Conservatory.

He directed Citro√´n as a vice-president and as chairman from 1935 until his death in a car accident. He was known to colleagues as PJB.  Biography  Boulanger was born in Sin-le-Noble Hauts-de-France. He studied fine art, but gave it up so that he could work. He worked in the French military service from 1906 to 1908. He met Marcel Michelin (nephew of √âdouard Michelin). After military service, he went to the United States where he undertook various trades. He returned to France in 1914 and was mobilized as corporal, becoming an aerial photographer. He performed well in the service and finished the war with the rank of Captain, decorated with the Military Cross and the Legion of Honour. Boulanger died in 1950 in a car accident driving a Citroen Traction Avant 15-Six, before having known the success of the Citro√´n DS project he had managed at Citroen. He is buried in the cemetery of Lempdes (Puy-de-D√¥me), near Clermont-Ferrand, where he had his house. Michelin Boulanger started working for Michelin in 1918, reporting directly to √âdouard Michelin, co-director and founder of the business. Boulanger joined the Michelin board in 1922, and in 1938, he became the company's joint managing director. In December 1934, despite the assistance of the Michelin company, Citro√´n filed for bankruptcy. In December 1934, Michelin, already the car manufacturer's largest creditor, became its principal shareholder. Boulanger became the assistant of Pierre Michelin, who was the chairman of Citro√´n. Pierre Boulanger became the vice-president and chief of the Engineering and Design department. He became president in 1937 after the death of his friend and kept his position until his death. He also jointly managed the Michelin company. As part of the policy to reduce costs, wages were decreased and the launching of the 22 V8 was cancelled. The policy bore fruit and Citro√´n recovered.Pre-1939 prototypes for 2CV. WW2 During the occupation of France in the Second World War, Boulanger refused to meet Dr. Ferdinand Porsche or communicate with the German authorities except through intermediaries. He organized a 'go slow' of production of trucks for the Wehrmacht, many of which were sabotaged at the factory, by putting the notch on the oil dipstick in the wrong place resulting in engine seizure. In 1944 when the Gestapo headquarters in Paris was sacked by members of the French Resistance, his name was prominent on a German blacklist of the most important 'Enemies of the Reich' to be arrested in the event of an allied invasion of France. TPV becomes 2CV In 1936, Boulanger initiated a project to create the TPV (short for 'Tr√®s Petite Voiture' meaning 'very small car'), which became 2CV in 1948. His specification for the new model was characteristic of the man: The 2CV was known for its great capacity of work and its absence of ostentation. In 1947, the Citro√´n H Van was introduced ‚Äì this utilitarian commercial van was sold until 1981. He died at Bro√ªt-Vernet, Allier, in a car crash in a Citro√´n Traction Avant on Sunday, 12 November 1950, while on the main road between Clermont-Ferrand (the home of Michelin) and Paris.\\"Crash Kills Boulanger, Citroen Motor President\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, 13 November 1950, p1 References Category:1885 births Category:1950 deaths Category:People from Sin-le-Noble Category:French businesspeople in transport Category:Michelin people Category:French automotive pioneers ","title":"Pierre-Jules Boulanger"},{"id":"12713712","text":"The National Organ Transplant Act (1984 ), approved October 19, 1984, and amended in 1988 and 1990, outlawed the sale of human organs and provided for the establishment of the Task Force on Organ Transplantation; authorized the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants for the planning, establishment, and initial operation of qualified Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs); and established the formation of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. It was sponsored by Rep. Al Gore and Sen. Orrin Hatch.American Medical Association Journal of Ethics: http://virtualmentor.ama- assn.org/2005/09/hlaw1-0509.html History Before NOTA was put in place, there was no clear jurisdiction on what property rights were for a human corpse. Instead, America applied a \\"quasi-right\\" to a corpse. This meant that the relatives of a deceased person had a possessory right long enough to decide how to bury or dispose of the corpse. This does not mean a property right which means they do not have a right to transfer, devise, possess, and lease the human organs and tissues.Mayes, Gwen. \\"Buying and Selling Organs for Transplantation in the United States.\\" Medscape Education 4, no. 3 (2003): 1-4. Due to a shortage in organs but a growing demand for transplantations, people began to use other means to purchase organs outside of a hospital setting. The organ market began to become a commercial market. H. Barry Jacobs, the head of a Virginia company, announced in 1983 a new plan to buy and sell human organs on the market. This plan put healthy, human kidneys in the price range of up to $10,000 plus a $2,000 to $5,000 commission fee for Jacobs.Mayes, page 1. This brought the issue out into the open. NOTA was a response to this proposal making it criminal to transfer human organs for valuable consideration for the purposes of a human transplantation.National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984, Pub L. 98-507, 98 Stat. 2339-2348 (Oct. 19, 1984). At the time NOTA was passed, there was an 80% survival rate for kidney transplants. A new drug, cyclosporin, that had been introduced had also increased the survival rate of liver transplant patients from 35% to 70% in a patients first year of undergoing a liver transplant. This made it clear that the legislation was aware of a growing need and also growing shortage of organs when NOTA was passed.\\"The National Organ Transplant Act.\\" US Legal Healthcare. US Legal, 2010. NOTA made it illegal to compensate organ donors, but did not prevent payment for other forms of donations (such as human plasma, sperm, and egg cells). Although bone marrow is not an organ or a component of an organ, the act made paying bone marrow donors illegal. At the time the act was passed, donating bone marrow involved a painful and risky medical procedure. In the years after the act was passed, a new procedure (apheresis) made it possible to harvest bone marrow cells through a non- surgical procedure similar to blood donation. In 2009, a public interest law firm (The Institute for Justice) sued to allow donors to be compensated for giving bone marrow. The firm argued that the development of apheresis meant that donors who gave bone marrow through blood donation should be allowed to receive compensation. The organization predicted that allowing compensation would increase the pool of available donors, and claimed that 3,000 Americans die each year while waiting for compatible marrow donors. Critics argued that allowing compensation could reduce donation, increase the risk of disease, and lead to exploitation of the poor. In December 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that donors giving bone marrow via apheresis were eligible for compensation. In November 2013, the federal government proposed a regulation that would change legal definitions to cover bone marrow regardless of how it is obtained. This would have the effect of keeping the ban on compensating donors in place. As of July 2014, the proposal was still under review. Sections of NOTA=Title I - Task Force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation Title I states the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Task Force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation to regulate how deceased donor organs are handled and who receives transplantations and the process one must go through in regards to a deceased donor organ transplantation along with other lines of duty. This Task Force is composed of 25 members. Duties of the Task Force include: *handling all medical, legal, ethical, economic, and social issues that may rise from obtaining deceased human organs and the transplantation of them. *assessing immunosuppressive medication used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients, including safety, effectiveness, costs, insurance reimbursements, and making sure those who need these drugs can receive them *prepare a report including assessments of public and private efforts to obtain deceased human organs, problems in obtaining these organs, recommendations for education and training of health professionals and for education of the general public *assessment of the effectiveness and of establishing a national registry of deceased human organ donors A full list can be found in Sec. 101 (3) in .National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, Sec. 101 Title II - Organ Procurement Activities Title II established the Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) for deceased organ transplants.

US Department of Human Health and Services. NOTA also established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), a membership organization transplant-related individuals and organizations, primarily transplant centers.

This registry includes patient information and transplant procedures.National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984, Sec. 373. Title III - Prohibition of Organ Purchases NOTA specifically states \\"it shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce.\\" The penalty of breaking this law is a fine of $50,000 or up to five years in prison, or both.National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984, Sec. 301.

This registry is upheld by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984, Sec. 401.

Ethics Some believe that if organ transplantation is a commercial process, incentives for the disfranchised and poor would be created to manipulate them into being more willing to donate. The issue of putting a purchase price on a body part resembles slavery and treats a class of people as subhuman. These critics believe that this dehumanization is intolerable. Also, the buying and selling of organs for transplantation as a business arrangement would lead to misrepresentation of a person's medical information if the donor was in poor financial shape.Mayes, page 4.

The film is also known by the U.S. title Strong Boys. Plot Charlie drifts through life as he and his friends enjoy a lifestyle of house parties, casual sex and drugs. However, after breaking into a house to rob it, Charlie finds a gun (they found the keys and address in a handbag they had recently stolen). During the robbery, three of the friends (Charlie, Justin and Damien) accidentally awaken the owner, a hefty Jamaican man who promptly chases them into the street with a golf club. The trio escape, much to the amusement of Justin and Damien. However, despite Charlie promising to tell Justin everything, he decides to keep the gun a secret. Sometime later the story picks up Charlie and Justin as they walk through a disused car park. After looking in the window of a BMW it becomes clear that Julie, the girlfriend of Francis (Dyer), another member of 'The Firm', is having sex with 'local nutter' Eddie (Phil Daniels), who is some 20 years older. By this time in the story it has become clear that Charlie is dissatisfied with his lifestyle and would prefer to try to make something of his life, unlike Justin, who would clearly prefer things to remain the same. This point is highlighted when the two attend a party being thrown by Charlie's cousin Hector Moriati (Richard Driscoll), with Charlie being offered a job as an estate agent. Hector eventually throws Justin out, and Hector in turn asks Charlie to stay (which he does not). On the way back home from the party, the pair begin to fight, Charlie clearly furious that Justin has ruined an opportunity for him to turn his life around. Charlie, as the narrator, informs the audience that from that point on 'Things could never be the same'. The following day Charlie approaches Francis in the street and the pair head off to a boxing gym where Francis announces his intention to propose to Julie. Charlie tells Francis about Julie's affair with Eddie. Francis, in a tearful rage, walks out of the room and goes on the hunt for Eddie, baseball bat in hand. When Francis eventually finds Eddie he smashes the window of his BMW, provoking Eddie to run him down. Charlie then arrives as Francis lies unconscious in the road. As Charlie waits in hospital he is visibly moved by an upset woman, presumably Francis's mother, and decides to take revenge on Eddie with the stolen pistol. After finding Eddie he loses his nerve, prompting Eddie to tell him to 'Fuck off out my house before you and I fall out'. After leaving, Charlie eventually shows the gun to Justin, who becomes very attached to it and suggests that they should kill Eddie. Justin is later insulted by a child in the park and threatens him with the gun, going as far as pushing the barrel into the frightened boy's mouth. Horrified, Charlie snatches the gun from Justin and tells him he no longer wishes to be associated with him. A distressed Justin tries to make amends but Charlie refuses, instead giving him the gun as a farewell gift. Instantly Justin runs off, pursued by Charlie who has realised that Justin intends to use the weapon. Charlie catches up to Justin but only watches as Justin shoots Eddie in the leg (he survives the shot and is heard shouting afterwards) and the pair make their way to the top of a high rise building. The police arrive and Justin tells Charlie to leave or risk being arrested. Charlie seemingly forgives Justin and the two hug. The final scene shows the pair going down different paths: Justin turning himself in to the police with a smile on his face and with a crowd cheering for him, and Charlie as he packs his bags and leaves. A child (who makes several appearances throughout the film) asks Charlie where he's going as he leaves; he simply replies \\"Somewhere\\".

It is endemic to the Chatham Islands. Once thought to be extinct, it is now known to survive on South East Island/Rangatira; being therefore an example of a so-called \\"Lazarus taxon\\". Discovery and history of collection Natural History Museum, London Xylotoles costatus was first described and named by Francis Polkinghorne Pascoe in 1875, based on male and female specimens collected by Henry H. Travers on Pitt Island. A type specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. The last known collection of this beetle, prior to its rediscovery, was by Thomas Hall who extensively sampled Pitt Island for beetles between 1906 and 1908. He collected three specimens which are now held in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. Description and identification 1875 illustration of Xylotoles costatus by Edward William Robinson from the article by Pascoe first describing the species Identification of Xylotoles costatus is difficult as it is very similar in appearance to another longhorn beetle found in the Chatham Islands, Xylotoles traversii. Both species are coloured black with a green bronze sheen, however it is likely that X. costatus has more of a bronze sheen than X. traversii. Of the two species X. costatus also has the more pronounced ridges on its wing cases. Generally X. traversii is the smaller beetle of the two, but the size of the two species can overlap. However, if a longhorn beetle specimen is found in the Chatham Islands that is greater than 16 mm in length it is likely to be X. costatus. Habitat This species of longhorn beetle is usually found on the trunks of Coprosma chathamica at night. Recently dead or dying branches also attract adult beetles. Conservation and threats As X. costatus is flightless and will spend time moving on the ground between trees, it is vulnerable to rodent predation. Knowing its exact habitat requirements as an adult and at the larval stage is thought to be a conservation priority. This species has not been seen at its type locality of Pitt Island since 1907 despite extensive surveys for it since 1990. After 1910, it was not seen again until 1987; the latter and all subsequent specimens have been collected on Rangatira, an island that lies off the south- east coast of Pitt Island. This species is the only longhorn beetle that is legally protected under schedule 7 of the 1953 Wildlife Act, making it an offense to kill, possess, buy or sell a specimen.

Their mission was to organize resistance to the Germans, aid in the rescue of Allied personnel and carry out assignments set by the Jewish Agency of Palestine. History Of the 250 original volunteers, 110 underwent training. Thirty-two eventually parachuted into Europe and five infiltrated the target countries by other routes. Most of those selected for training were emigr√©s from Europe, with intimate knowledge of the countries to which they would be sent. Three of the parachutists infiltrated Hungary, five participated in the Slovak National Uprising in October 1944, and six operated in northern Italy. Ten parachutists served with British liaison missions to the Yugoslav partisans. Nine parachutists operated in Romania. Two others entered Bulgaria, and one each operated in France and Austria. The Germans captured twelve and executed seven of the 37 parachutists sent into occupied Europe. Three of those executed were captured in Slovakia. Two were captured in Hungary and one in northern Italy. After seven missions the parachutist who entered France was captured and killed. Hannah Szenes, one of the best-known of the parachutists, was seized in German-occupied Hungary and executed in Budapest on November 7, 1944, at the age of 23. Szenes was a talented poet and her songs are still sung in Israel. After the war, remains of three of the seven parachutists killed in the war, including Szenes, were interred on the National Military and Police cemetery in Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem. Memorials for the other four are also at Mount Herzl Cemetery.

Life and career  Halton trained at the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his Broadway debut in 1901, after which he appeared in about 35 productions during the next 50 years. From the 1920s, Halton's thinning hair, rimless glasses, stern-looking face and officious manner were also familiar to generations of American moviegoers. Whether playing the neighborhood busybody, a stern government bureaucrat or weaselly attorney, Halton's characters tried to drive the \\"immoral influences\\" out of the neighborhood, foreclose on the orphanage, evict the poor widow and her children from their apartment, or any other number of dastardly deeds, all justified usually by \\"...I'm sorry but that's my job.\\" Among his highest profile roles were Mr. Carter, the bank examiner in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the Polish theatre producer Dobosh in Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (1942), and a county official from Idaho in Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941). In Enemy of Women (1944), the story of Joseph Goebbels, Halton played against type as a kindly radio performer of children's stories who is arrested by the Nazis. Although his career slowed down in the 1950s, he also played roles in numerous television series. His 40-year film career ended with High School Confidential (1958), after which he retired. On April 16, 1959, Halton died of hepatitis in Los Angeles. He was 83.

The name Agassiz Needle was originally applied to another nearby peak in 1879, likely Mount Winchell, but at some point the name moved to the current peak. Climbing There are three major routes to Agassiz's summit. The easiest is the west slope, both for its non-technical ascent and proximity to the Bishop Pass Trail. From South Lake, the trail climbs gently to Bishop Pass, and the summit route begins there. An attempt to ascend from the west via a chute can lead off route, to areas requiring more technical mountaineering skills and equipment. Another class 2 scrambling route is the southeast face by way of the south ridge, from Agassiz Col. A more technical route is the northeast face, which requires class 4 climbing. Norman Clyde established it by following a canyon, couloir and ar√™te from Fifth Lake.

It is made up of six regular regiments and one volunteer (reserve) regiment. Regiment Center located at Kew Road, Slave Island, Colombo. Present strength of the Corps is 145 Officers and 4150 ORs. Role The role of the Sri Lanka Electrical & Mechanical Engineers (SLEME) is to repair and maintain all electrical, mechanical biomedical and optical equipment in the SL Army, except for engineer plant and signal equipment. Repair and recovery teams are employed in the field to give repair and recovery support to operational commitments. In addition to its classic role SLEME is tasked to function essential services such as electricity (power generation), water supply drainage and railways during times of workers unrest and strikes. There are three base workshops at Udawalawe, Katubedda and Colombo for base repairs of vehicles/equipment. Corps is consist with a trade school to up-lift the knowledge of its members at Gannoruwa-Kandy. The SLEME also undertakes the production of Unibuffel APCs. History The Corps of Ceylon Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (CEME) was born on 12 December 1949 with the enlistment of 2/Lt. R.A.J Ratnam CEME. The CEME first became operative as a small workshop, located in the Army Headquarters premises under the advisory capacity of Capt. Roy Davies REME. Activities were initially confined to minor repairs to mechanical transport vehicles, armaments, small arms and the production of a large quantity of training stores. Later an engineer officer, Maj N.V Matthysz was appointed officer commanding and was its first commanding officer in the rank of lieutenant colonel. The unit moved to Kew Road, Slave Island (where its present Regiment Centre is) on 1 September 1950. This was a command workshop of the REME, and the CEME was fortunate to get the building with some of the available machinery as most of such machinery was back loaded by the British before the hand over. The CEME strength when moving to the new premises was 1 British officer seconded form REME, 2 Ceylonese officers, 4-seconded NCOs from the REME, 14 other ranks and some civilian tradesmen. Unicorn Research began in 1983 by a concerned infantry major named Jayantha de Silva to locally develop an armored personnel carrier to protect troops against land mines and IEDs that became rampant in the northern and eastern provinces with the escalation of the Sri Lankan civil war. His design was different from that of the South African Buffels that provided protection only against land mines, in that the passenger and driver were in a single compartment built almost two metres from ground level to dissipate the explosive force of the IED. Subsequently, the Army's Sri Lanka Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, to whom the construction of the original vehicles was entrusted, developed a second version based on the Buffels which had been brought in 1985. SLEME developed the Unicorn Mark I by 1987, that was produced in large numbers by the SLEME for the Sri Lanka Army and for the other services too with a total of 93 Unicorns being produced. Unibuffel MK II Armored Personnel Carriers on Military Parade Unibuffel Since 2000 the SLEME shifted to producing the more advanced Unibuffel with a total of 53 Unibuffel being produced as of 2006.

It is located in County Wicklow close to the village of Kilternan (County Dublin).  History  The Ski Club of Ireland was founded in 1963 and a few years later ran its first slope in Knockrabo in Goatstown, south County Dublin.History of the Ski Club of Ireland. In the mid-1970s the club moved from Goatstown to its present location close to Kilternan.  Facilities  The ski club has four ski slopes: a main slope (180 meters long), an intermediate slope (130 meters long) and two nursery slopes. The slopes' surfaces are covered in Dendix, a by-product of brush manufacturing which is similar to a short haired brush with the bristles sticking upwards. Dendix is manufactured in Chepstow in the United Kingdom; however, it can be found on slopes throughout the world.Dendix installing ski slope in Moscow. A water misting system lubricates the main and intermediate slopes, which helps increase speed and reduce friction. The ski club has a clubhouse located beside the slopes which houses an office and equipment dispensing area. Rental equipment is included in the price of class tickets or practice passes. Boots are Salomon and skis tend to be Rossignol or Head. There is a kitchen with basic tea and coffee facilities and a microwave.  Ski School  The club offers ski lessons for all abilities. Instructors in the ski school include ISIA qualified instructors.The minis gets taught by two or three instructors, and goes on from 10:00 to11:30.The instructors are quite nice and the minis is very enjoyable, especially the biscuits we get at break. Most of the instructors' qualifications have been obtained through the Irish Association of Snow Sports Instructors or BASI. There are, however, a few native Austrian, German and Spanish skiers amongst the instructors. Class groups consist of four 1.15-hour classes and 30 minutes of free skiing afterwards. The classes are broken down as follows * A1-A4: Introduction to skiing through to basic plough turns and learning to use a drag lift * B1-B4: Refining plough turns and progressing to swing turns * C1-C4: Progression through swing turns and includes traversing, side slipping, effective use of ski poles, and introduces elements of the parallel turn * D1-D4: Working towards linked parallel turns from the top of the main slope * E1-E4: Teaches variations on the parallel turn, practicing techniques for confident and efficient mastery of the piste; includes carved turns and short swings The Ski School runs clinics on Wednesday and Friday nights for more advanced skiers. These clinics focus on high end skiing and adult race training including Slalom and GS race courses through gates. One day courses are run on Saturdays through the ski season. These normally compact five lessons into one day; for example, new skiers are taken from class A1-B1 in one day. There is a snowboarding school on Tuesday and Thursday nights with a Sunday evening Jam for boarders only.  Race Squad  The squad trains on Wednesday evenings, 7:30pm to 10:30pm and Sunday mornings, 9am to 12pm under the guidance of head coach Brian Byrne. The coaching panel includes Carolyn Dent-Neville, Suzanne Reidy and Matthew Mitchell. The Race Training Squad caters for those wishing to further develop their racing skills and are interested in committing to an intensive training program. Training sessions are divided as follows: * Ski training This involves working towards more complex aspects of skiing such as weight distribution in the turn, loading the ski, hip and knee angulation, etc. but can include some basic exercises where necessary. In addition a large amount of time is spent working in slalom courses (on Sunday mornings). * Fitness training This consists of activities such as dynamic warm-ups, anaerobic fitness, and speed training. It also includes regular fitness testing. Fitness training sessions vary between 30 and 60 minutes. Shane O'Connor, Brian Byrne, Peter Byrne and Kirsty McGarry all competed at the World Championships in Val d'isere in 2009 with Shane O'Connor also competing in the Winter Olympics in Vancouver in 2010. Development squad training Development squad training runs on Wednesdays and Sundays alongside Race Squad training, coached by Tony McGuiness under the direction of Shane O'Connor. This training session caters for juniors aged 11 years old and upwards who are looking to further develop their skills towards joining the race training squad. Prospective trainees should have the ability to ski from the top of the slope and should be comfortable skiing at speed. The development training sessions focus on improving basic technique in progression to carving parallel turns. Over time trainees may graduate to the Race Training Squad (dependent on assessment). Children's race training Children's race training runs on a Saturday morning under the guidance of Ciaran Columb. The session caters for children aged between 7 and 11 years old. Prospective trainees need to have the ability to ski from the top of the slope and should be comfortable skiing at speed. The children's race training sessions focus on improving basic technique, progression from snowplough to parallel skiing (including carving), introduction to slalom training and racing.

LNMU begins from the Medical Faculty of Lviv University, which was opened on November 16, 1784, according to the privilege of the Austrian emperor Josef II. The Medical School is named after King Daniel of Galicia, the historical founder of the city in 1256 AD. In 2009 University celebrated its 225 anniversary. History The building of the University. The history of Lviv Medical University goes back to 1661, when on 20 January the Jesuit Collegium in Lviv by the privilege of Polish King John II Casimir acquired the status of academy. It consisted of four departments and was awarded the title of the university. However, until the break-up of the university in 1773, the full- blown medical department was not established. On 16 November 1784, according to the privilege of the Austrian emperor Joseph II, signed on 21 October 1784, Lviv University was revived with four faculties: theology, philosophy, law and medicine. Since then Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University started counting its age.  Until 1918  On January 20, 1661, King John II Casimir Vasa granted the privilege transforming the Jesuit College into an Academy with four faculties. There was no medical faculty at that time and this condition lasted until the closing of the university by the Austrian authorities in 1773. Emperor Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor by a privilege of October 21, 1784 agreed to resume the university's activity, which took place November 16, 1784. The faculties of law, theology, philosophy and medicine, the existence of a medical college in Lviv has been dated since. In 1891, the Austro-Hungarian government decided to establish an independent medical faculty thanks to the intercession of the governor of Galicia (Eastern Europe), Count Kasimir Felix Badeni a medical faculty was established. In the same year, the city authorities and governorship allocated the university the area at ul. Piekarska 52 for the construction of a new faculty. The author of the project was J√≥zef Braunseis , under whose leadership the main building of descriptive anatomy and physiology, forensic medicine, pathology, as well as chemistry and pharmacology was created in four years. By 1898, new facilities were erected to house the departments of obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, dermatology and venereology, and otolaryngology. In March 1900, the first sixteen graduates with the title of doctor, fourteen Poles and two Ukrainians graduated from the university. At the beginning of the 20th century many lecturers were recruited from universities with longer traditions and reputation, i.e. the Jagiellonian University , Viennaand in Heidelberg .  Second Polish Republic  After the beginning of the 1918 academic year, education was discontinued, staff and students fought to Battle of Lemberg (1918) . The next academic year was interrupted due to the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. The university's activity was activated on March 15, 1920, within two years the Faculty of Medicine encompassed twenty-one departments, and nineteen professors were among the academic staff. In 1929 the university structure was reorganized, the Pharmaceutical Department was established at that time. Before the outbreak of World War II, the Faculty of Medicine consisted of twenty-four departments and clinics, and thirteen full professors, five associate professors and thirty-three associate professors worked among the scientific staff. World-renowned scholars lectured at the medical faculty, including Henryk Kadyi, Wladyslaw Szymonowicz, John Prussia, Adolf Beck (physiologist) , Antoni Mars, Ludwik Rydygier , Antoni Cieszy≈Ñski , Roman Rencki, Jakub Karol Parnas , Rudolf Weigl , Antoni W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gluzi≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Budzy≈Ñski , Edmund Biernacki , Leon Popielski, W≈Çodzimierz Sieradzki, Hilary Schramm, Emanuel Machek, Antoni Jurasz, Henryk Halban, Zdzis≈Çaw Steusing, Napoleon GƒÖsiorowski, Witold Ziembicki, Jan Grek, Tadeusz Ostrowski, Adam Gruca, Jan Lenartowicz, Adam Bednarski, Kazimierz Boche≈Ñski, Franciszek Gro√´r, Eugeniusz Artwi≈Ñski, Teofil Zalewski, J√≥zef Antoni Markowski, Boles≈Çaw Ja≈Çowy, Mieczys≈Çaw Wierzuchowski, W≈Çodzimierz Koskowski, Marian Franke, Witold Nowicki (lekarz) . The Main Building of the Medical Faculty of the Former University of Emperor Francis I in 1894 In the 1938/1939 academic year various Departments in the Medical School were: * Internal diseases; * Surgery; * Orthopedics; * Dermatology; * Ophthalmology; * Obstetrics; * Gynecology; * Pediatrics; * Nervous diseases; * Psychiatry; * Otolaryngology; * Dentistry; * Histology; * Embryology; * Physiology; * Pharmacology; * Pathology; * Anatomy; * Forensic medicine; * Hygiene; * Medical microbiology; * History of medicine; * General biology; * Medical chemistry. = Secret Ukrainian University = After the end of the Polish- Bolshevik war by the decision of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education (Poland), the University of Lviv became a university with only Polish as the language of instruction, professors and lecturers of Ukrainian origin were removed from the university. This caused a protest and the establishment of underground Ukrainian higher education, under which a secret Ukrainian Technical College and the Ukrainian University were established, in which the medical faculty operated in the years 1921‚Äì1925. There were ten departments where one hundred and eighty-five students studied. The group of lecturers included, among others Marian Panchyshyn, Iwan Kuroweƒá, Maksym Muzyka, Stefan Baley, and O≈Çeksandr Barwinski. Due to the lack of facilities and the possibility of conducting laboratory and clinical exercises after completing the third year, students continued to study abroad.  World War II  After entering the city of the Red Army in autumn 1939, the Soviet authorities reorganized higher education to adapt it to the model in force in the USSR. The Faculty of Medicine was separated from the structures of the University of Lviv and became an independent university called the State Medical Institute. Oleksandr Makarczenko became the rector, the university ran two faculties - health care and pharmaceutical. In the same year, a medical science library was founded .

Bodkin, an only child who had grown up on a farm near Kokomo, Indiana, began advertising his services in the short-lived Ball Club Quarterly magazine, and castrated his \\"clients\\" in exchange for their permission to videotape the procedures. While voluntary chemical or surgical castration is legal for repeat sex offenders in certain US states, for individuals undergoing sex reassignment surgery, and for other medical reasons, in otherwise healthy individuals a desire for castration is often viewed as psychotic. The Huntington, Indiana, county prosecutor charged Bodkin with practicing medicine without a license, a Class C felony that made him eligible for thousands in fines and up to eight years in prison. He ultimately admitted to performing five castrations (he also kept \\"the trophies,\\" in jars labelled with dates, initials, and an L or R). On April 12, 1999, Judge Mark McIntosh sentenced Bodkin to four years in jail, with two- and-a-half years suspended and credit for 69 days served. In a prepared statement, Bodkin said: > I felt it prudent to spare the court unnecessary time considerations and > graphic details regarding this case. Such details might be repugnant to some > and a source of folly for others ... My activities were conducted at the > specific request of the parties ... to absolve emotional, psychological or > physical needs ... not merely the spurious fancy of some alternate > lifestyle. Bodkin was arrested in August 2011 by the Elmore County Sheriff's Office. Bodkin was brought to the attention of law enforcement after he sent sexually explicit material, including child pornography to an inmate of the Massachusetts Department of Correction's Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons. After obtaining a search warrant for Bodkin's home in Slapout, Alabama sheriff's deputies found additional child pornography and photos of human castrations. According to law enforcement Bodkin admitted to recording children as young as one month old in sexual acts. Further investigation of Bodkin was turned over to the Secret Service.

Biography Jos√© Eulalio Samayoa was educated within the system of guilds, progressing from apprentice to journeyman before becoming a master. He founded the Philharmonic Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, with a series of musical and liturgical celebrations held on July 2, 1813. The same day he was admitted to the Guatemala Cathedral choir, as third tenor, which he regarded as a heavenly grace for having established the Philharmonic Society. In 1842 he wrote the history of this Society, with an extended historical appendix on the development of Music in Guatemala since the earliest days of the Spanish missions, thus becoming the first music historian in Central America and perhaps all of Latin America. Samayoa is one of the first composers in the Americas to attempt the composition of larger instrumental forms that culminates in the symphony. Having been trained in the tradition of Spanish church music, he was taught how to write well for voices with instrumental accompaniment. The resulting forms, mainly those of the villancico and cantata, were defined by the poetic form of the text. When the Cathedral chapter decided in 1804 that vernacular matins texts were not up to the standard, chapel master Vicente S√°enz tried to remedy the situation by substituting villancicos for movements of concertos by Antonio Vivaldi and menuets from symphonies by Joseph Haydn. Samayoa however was of the opinion that a new instrumental music of local invention and flavour should be used, and so he started with short pieces called \\"sones\\" that were part of the culture of the local Indians. Studying Haydn, he taught himself European instrumental forms, writing first his brief \\"Tocatas\\", and then expanding to ever larger movements, until he was able to sustain his musical discourse in full-fledged symphonies. The oldest extant work in this form is his Seventh Symphony finished in June, 1834, which he dedicated to the victory of the Federal Army at the battle of Jiquilisco, in present-day El Salvador. It is structured, as would be expected, in four movements: allegro, andante, minuet, and a fast finale with programmatic elements such as a stylized military march and a \\"son.\\" It is scored for strings with pairs of oboes and horns. Two later symphonies, the \\"Sinfon√≠a c√≠vica\\" and the \\"Sinfon√≠a Hist√≥rica\\" demand larger orchestral forces in expanded movements. Works Orchestral: Three extant symphonies: Symphony No. 7, dedicated to the victory of the Federal Army at Xiquilisco; \\"Sinfon√≠a C√≠vica\\"; \\"Sinfon√≠a Hist√≥rica\\"; \\"Piezas para tocarse en la Iglesia,\\" for larger orchestra; \\"Piezas de Iglesia,\\" for small orchestra; \\"Tocatas de Iglesia\\", for strings and two horns. Chamber: \\"Tocatas\\" for string trio. Vocal-choral: 8 Masses, including \\"Misa del Se√±or San Jos√©\\", for three- part chorus and orchestra; \\"Servicio de difuntos\\" (Requiem); music for funerary services; music for vespers; and villancicos for matins.

Early life Detrosier's parents were Manchester merchant Robert Norris and a French woman named Detrosier. He was born in London but was abandoned. He was then adopted by Charles Barnes, a Swedenborgian tailor who raised him in Hulme, Manchester. Barnes treated him as his own son and named him Rowley.Lee (2004) Before he started work aged nine, Detrosier had received only informal education, including that from the Manchester Benevolent Vegetarian Institute. He worked in a variety of menial jobs and married aged nineteen but managed to teach himself something of French, Latin, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, and geology. His appetite for learning reduced Detrosier to dire financial straits by 1821 and he was only rescued by the patronage of John Shuttleworth, who found him a more secure and responsible job as a clerk and salesman. At this time, he also discovered his birth parentage. Lecturer and preacher Now, Detrosier had even more scope for education. He had lectured on science at Swedenborgian Sunday Schools since he was sixteen and he now travelled widely advocating adult education for working class people. Detrosier was a religious follower of Joseph Brotherton and Brotherton recruited him to preach at the Brinksway Chapel, Stockport where he gained a huge following. In 1827, he was inspired to publish A Form of Public Worship on the Principles of Pure Deism but his deism was too radical for Brotherton who expelled him from his sect. Radical In March 1829, Detrosier led a break-away from the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, which he considered to be undemocratic, and established the New Mechanics' Institution.Kargon (1977) John Doherty sought his help in establishing trade unions but Detrosier was no socialist, believing that democracy posed real dangers unless individual moral development preceded political freedom. Detrosier attracted the further patronage of Francis Place who established him as a full-time lecturer. Shuttleworth arranged for the 1831 publication of On the Necessity of an Extension of Moral and Political Instruction among the Working Classes and his work attracted the attention of Jeremy Bentham and Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron. In 1831, Detrosier became secretary of the National Political Union whereby he became friends with John Stuart Mill and met Thomas Carlyle, Gustave d'Eichtal, George Birkbeck, and John Arthur Roebuck. Detrosier's new position in the liberal political establishment led him to work with health campaigner Thomas Southwood Smith. Detrosier lectured on meteorology and pneumatics at the London Mechanics' Institute but was dismissed when he acted as interpreter for Gregorio Fontana and Gioacchino Prati's campaign in England in 1833.The Times, Wednesday 30 October 1833, p.3 col.F However, he found a new sponsor in Robert Mordan and Detrosier made a living lecturing and writing. In 1834, he contracted a common cold and died at his home in London. He left his body to science. NotesBibliography * *Lee, M.

Nassy was living in Belgium when World War II began, and was one of about 2,000 civilians holding American passports who were confined in German internment camps during the war. Born Joseph Johan Cosmo Nassy in Paramaribo, Suriname (Dutch Guiana), Nassy was the son of a well-to-do businessman. He descended on his father's side from Jews who had fled Spain during the Inquisition, although by his grandparents' generation the family no longer practised Judaism. In 1919, Nassy began to live with his father, who had moved to New York. He graduated from high school and, in 1926, earned a certificate in electrical engineering. In 1929, Nassy went to England, where he was employed in the installation of sound systems for a film company. The following year he was sent to Paris and then to Belgium for the same purpose. Before leaving for Europe, Nassy had obtained an American passport under the name Josef Nassy. He apparently claimed that he was born in San Francisco in 1899. Since San Francisco's public records had been destroyed in the earthquake of 1906, authorities issued the passport without further investigation. Nassy continued to work for the same firm until 1934, when he decided to study painting. He was admitted to an academy of fine arts in Brussels, Belgium. In 1939, he married a Belgian and began earning a living as a portrait artist. The Germans occupied Belgium in May 1940, but Nassy and his wife did not leave. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States entered World War II. On April 14, 1942, four months after the United States entered the war, Nassy was arrested as an enemy national in German-occupied Belgium. For seven months, he was held in the Beverloo transit camp in Leopoldsburg, Belgium; he was then transferred to Germany and spent the rest of the war (1942-1945) at the Laufen internment camp and its subcamp, Tittmoning, both in Upper Bavaria. Throughout his three- year imprisonment, Nassy created a unique visual diary of more than 200 paintings and drawings. Many of these works depict daily life in the internment camps. Rules of the Geneva Conventions governed conditions in civilian internment camps, including Laufen and Tittmoning in Nazi Germany. In contrast, such rules did not apply at the nearby Dachau concentration camp and other camps across Nazi-occupied Europe, where, prisoners were brutally exploited for forced labor, and many died from exhaustion, starvation, and other harsh conditions. Nassy and other internees in Laufen and Tittmoning were not detailed for forced labor. They usually had enough food, thanks to Red Cross packages that supplemented German rations of bread and soup. The International YMCA supplied Nassy with sketch pads, pencils, crayons, oil paints, and painting boards‚Äîmaterials that were not available in concentration camps, where imprisoned artists who sketched clandestinely were forced to improvise using scraps of paper or supplies stolen from the Germans. The camp commandant actually encouraged Nassy to paint and give art lessons to other internees; however the life that Nassy depicted was obviously restricted. His works stressed features such as barbed wire, watchtowers, walls, gates, and prison bars. By early 1945, 850 men holding American and British passports were interned at Laufen and Tittmoning. Many of the Americans were expatriates whose immigrant parents had returned to Europe for various reasons in the 1920s and 1930s. A dozen blacks and about 50 Jews were also interned at these camps. Many of the Jews had obtained false papers showing British, South American, or U.S. citizenship. The U.S. Third Army liberated Laufen on May 5, 1945. Nassy and nearly all the internees at Laufen and Tittmoning survived the war. A year after liberation, Nassy was repatriated to Belgium. He succeeded in getting all his works out of Germany and in the following years participated in a number of expositions of Holocaust art; he often expressed the hope that his works be kept together. Severin Wunderman, a California businessman and art collector, purchased much of Nassy collection in 1984. In 1992, he donated that collection to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. At least 19 paintings from Nassy's internment at Laufen-Tittmoning and recovery in Belgium upon release exist in private hands.

An ALBM allows the launch aircraft to stand off at long distances from its target, keeping it well outside the range of defensive weapons like anti-aircraft missiles and interceptor aircraft. Once launched, the missile is essentially immune to interception. This combination of features allowed a strategic bomber to present a credible deterrent second- strike option in an era when improving anti-aircraft defences appeared to be rendering conventional bombers obsolete. The ALBM concept was studied in the US as a way to ensure the usefulness and survivability of their large bomber fleet. After testing several experimental designs as part of the WS-199 efforts, the USAF began development of the GAM-87 Skybolt missile with range on the order of . The only other major force relying on strategic bombers was the Royal Air Force, who also selected the Skybolt to arm their V bomber fleet. The Soviet Union moved their strategic force directly to ICBMs. Skybolt ultimately failed several key tests, while the US Navy's UGM-27 Polaris offered the same advantages and more. Skybolt was cancelled, leading to the Skybolt crisis and an agreement to sell Polaris to the Royal Navy as part of the Nassau Agreement. The concept saw little active development until the 1970s when ICBM warheads began to become accurate enough to attack other ICBMs while they were still on the ground. The US carried out several experiments using existing missile designs dropped from cargo aircraft, but ultimately abandoned this line of research entirely. No further strategic ALBM development has been carried out, and this class of missile never saw active use.  High Virgo WS-199B Bold Orion Developed by Martin Aircraft, the Bold Orion missile was an air-launched ballistic missile, launched from the B-47 Stratojet medium bomber, with flight tests being carried out in 1958 and 1959. Early launches of the Bold Orion as a single-stage vehicle were unsuccessful, however a redesign as a two-stage weapon produced improved results, with the remainder of the 12-launch series establishing the ALBM as a viable vehicle. The final test flight trialed the Bold Orion missile as an anti-satellite missile, passing within of Explorer VI, the first-ever interception of a satellite.Peebles 1997, p. 65. GAM-87 Skybolt The GAM-87 Skybolt, intended to be launched from Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and Avro Vulcan bombers, was in development by the United States Air Force, with the United Kingdom as a customer. In 1962, with technical difficulties and costs mounting, the program was cancelled, with the United States and the UK concentrating on the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile instead. Air Mobile Feasibility test: C-5 w/ LGM-30 Air Mobile Feasibility demonstration, 24 October 1974 In the early 1970s, the USAF tested air- launching a Minuteman 1b ICBM from a C-5A Galaxy transport aircraft. On 24 October 1974, the Space and Missile Systems Organization successfully conducted an Air Mobile Feasibility test where a C-5A Galaxy aircraft air- dropped the 86,000-pound missile from 20,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean. The missile fell to 8,000 feet before its rocket engine fired. The 10-second engine burn carried the missile to 20,000 feet again before it dropped into the ocean. The test proved the feasibility of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile from the air. Operational deployment was discarded due to engineering and security difficulties, though the capability was used as a negotiating point in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.U.S. Air Force, Inside the AF.MIL Heritage section (Thursday, January 01, 1970 - Sunday, December 31, 1989) Marti and Sarigul-Klijn, A Study of Air Launch Methods for RLVs.

Set in the Wild West with steampunk and sci-fi influences, the story follows Annie and her bounty hunter Clint, seeking revenge for the death of her family. The player controls either Annie or Clint sidestepping and jumping in the foreground while shooting down enemy robots in the background and dodging enemy bullets. These gameplay mechanics combine elements from third-person shooters and light gun games. Development lasted five months on a small budget with a team of only three core members and two support staff. The team leads had previously worked together on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for the Super NES, and so chose to develop for that system. Wild Guns was heavily influenced in its gameplay and artistic design by arcade games such as Blood Bros. and Dynamite Duke. The game's scenery, characters, and sound design drew ideas from the Western film genre and the science fiction manga Cobra, creating a space western setting. Wild Guns received positive reviews at its initial release, and in retrospective reviews is considered a cult classic. Critics have praised the gameplay of what has become a niche genre, as well as the cooperative mode and graphical attention to detail. The game was rereleased on the Virtual Console for the Wii in 2010 and Wii U in 2014. An enhanced remaster titled Wild Guns Reloaded was released in 2016 for PlayStation 4, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, and 2018 for Nintendo Switch. Reloaded features two new characters, additional stages and modes, and updated visuals and audio. Gameplay left Wild Guns is a shooting gallery game with an American Wild West setting along with sci- fi and steampunk influences. The gameplay combines elements from third-person shooters and light gun games in a similar fashion to Blood Bros. and Cabal. There are six levels, each with two stages, followed by a mini-boss, and a third stage with a final boss. Single player and cooperative modes are available, as well as target practice allowing two players to compete to achieve the highest score. The story follows a young woman named Annie seeking revenge against the Kid family for abducting and killing her family. She seeks help from renowned space bounty hunter Clint. Although Clint says he doesn't need Annie's assistance, she insists, claiming she has a personal vendetta against the Kid family and is a skilled shooter. The player controls either Clint or Annie in the foreground with the D-pad and must shoot enemies in the background and dodge enemy fire. While holding the fire button down, the D-pad instead makes the gun reticle move. Shooting and moving at the same time is not possible. While the gun is holstered, the player can jump, dive, and roll to evade gunfire. A \\"Look Out!\\" text bubble will appear when one can dodge bullets. Some enemies will throw dynamite sticks at the player, but these can be tossed back. A lasso can be used to temporarily stun enemies. Both enemies and their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will sometimes reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as gold and silver for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, which can be used to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge at the bottom of the screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty. Development Clint and Annie were designed to be emblematic of the American frontier period Development of Wild Guns began when a small team of Natsume staff was asked to create a game quickly and cheaply while waiting for their next major assignment. The team consisted of three core members: Shunichi Taniguchi for game design and graphics, Toshiyasu Miyabe for programming, and Hiroyuki Iwatsuki for sound. Two other people helped as support staff. The team chose to develop for the Super NES because the three had worked together previously on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for that system. Development of Wild Guns lasted approximately five months and was led by Taniguchi. (Translation ) Wild Guns was heavily influenced by Dynamite Duke and Blood Bros. during development. The space western setting was largely influenced by the space western manga Cobra. The screen shaking and mirage-like effects that occur after explosions were influenced by the film RoboCop 3. When composing the music for Wild Guns, Hiroyuki Iwatsuki drew upon the influence of a western soundtrack \\"Best Of\\" CD that Natsume had provided him. He enjoyed listening to the CD both during and after development. The game's music was created using PC-98s, a Roland W-30 keyboard, and a MIDI sequencer. Some sounds came from the Roland Sound Canvas series. (Translation ) Originally, the reticle could only move up and down, and lateral movement was done by moving the player side-to-side; this, however, proved to be cumbersome and was changed. The \\"Look Out!\\" text bubble was added because of difficulty judging bullet distances due to the screen's artificial 3D depth. Clint and Annie were designed in clothing that was emblematic of the time period, and Annie's dress was chosen instead of jeans to avoid overlapping with Clint's design and to enable easier animation. The characters' names were suggested by the American Natsume offices. Due to the game's low budget, voice actors were not used; instead, Taniguchi's voice was recorded in the office bathroom for Clint.  Release  The game was released in Japan on August 12, 1994. The North American version of Wild Guns was set to be released in the third quarter of 1994 and was reviewed at the time, but the release was unexpectedly delayed until the third quarter of 1995. A 32X version was reportedly planned for 1996, but never materialized. The game has since become a rare collector's item. The game was rereleased on the Virtual Console for the Wii in 2010 and Wii U in 2014. An enhanced remaster titled Wild Guns Reloaded was released for the PlayStation 4 in December 2016. The game was developed by the original team (as Tengo Project) and features classic characters and stages but also enhancements such as more playable characters, enemies, stages, and local four-player support. The game was made available for download on the PlayStation Store, and physical copies were available from Amazon, Play-Asia, and Video Games Plus. Natsume released Reloaded on Microsoft Windows in July 2017, marking the company's first ever release on the personal computer. On April 17, 2018, Reloaded was released on the Nintendo Switch. Reception Contemporary reviews of the game were positive. Famitsu gave it a score of 26 out of 40. Reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly cited the cooperative multiplayer mode and challenging levels as the game's strongest points. They declared it one of the best shooters on the SNES and compared it to the Neo Geo game NAM-1975. GamePro praised the game for its intense action, fun cooperative multiplayer mode, colorful graphics, and ability to shoot almost any on-screen object. They remarked that the game is difficult even on easy, but that players are rewarded for perseverance. Nintendo Power found the game to have good graphics and control, and complimented the presence of both male and female playable characters. However, they believed the game was not as challenging as other shooters. In a retrospective Virtual Console review, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commended the gameplay depth and the detailed visual presentation. He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised the game as one of the best examples of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example of what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item. In another retrospective review, Todd Ciolek of GameSetWatch cited Wild Guns as one of the best games in a genre that has become a lost art. Critics and Natsume themselves have acknowledged Wild Guns as a cult classic. Wild Guns Reloaded was also well received. Critics praised the game for being a quality remaster of an already classic game. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS4 version of the game a score of 29 out of 40.

The original series was remarkable for pairing an American Napoleon Solo and a Russian Illya Kuryakin as two spies who work together for an international espionage organization at the height of the Cold War. Mr. Waverly is the head of the U.N.C.L.E. organization and was played by the English actor Leo G. Carroll. Background The pilot for the show featured a 'Mr. Allison' as the head of U.N.C.L.E., a character described as a pedantic man in his 50s. Will Kuluva was originally cast in the role, however he was replaced by Carroll after the pilot episode when an NBC executive reportedly suggested that the person with the name beginning with 'K' be omitted. It later emerged that he had meant the Russian spy Illya Kuryakin played by David McCallum. The show's producers thought he meant Kuluva. Although his scenes in the pilot episode 'The Vulcan Affair' were re-shot with Carroll in the role, Kuluva did appear as Mr. Allison in To Trap a Spy, a feature-length production based on the pilot which was released to cinemas in 1964. In eventually casting Carroll in the role, the programme makers took a considerable departure from this original concept since the actor was in his 70s at the time. However, the casting was also apt since Carroll had featured in many of Alfred Hitchcock's films and Hitchcock's work was a touchstone for the show's originators. Indeed, he had played the 'Professor', the head of the espionage agency in North by Northwest (1959), the film which inspired Norman Felton to bring the spy genre to the small screen. Character Along with Solo and Kuryakin, Alexander Waverly was the only character to appear on the show on a weekly basis. He is one of five regional heads in charge of the multi-national organisation, though his position appears to be that of primus inter pares, i.e., first among equals. In one episode he presides over an annual meeting of the regional heads ('The Summit Five Affair'). In contrast to the ambiguity surrounding the backgrounds of Solo and Kuryakin, we are given some insight into Waverly's family situation. He mentions a grandson called Melvin in 'The Bat Cave Affair'. His cousin Lester Baldwin (also played by Carroll) appears in 'The Bow Wow Affair'. His brother-in-law is Professor Hemingway of Y.I.T., who he sometimes uses as a consultant ('The Mad, MAD Tea Party Affair'). In 'The Cap and Gown Affair' it emerges that Waverly is an alumnus of Blair University. His niece Maude Waverly, played by Yvonne Craig, appears in the U.N.C.L.E. film One Spy too Many although she does not feature in 'The Alexander the Greater Affair' the two-part television episode on which the film is based. Mr. Waverly was also a regular in the short-lived, spin-off series The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., making Carroll one of the first actors to play the same role in two television shows. Personality Waverly is the stereotypical Englishman, formal, reserved, dressing in tweeds and smoking a large pipe. He addresses everyone by their courtesy titles and surnames. He is the head of Section One in U.N.C.L.E. headquarters in New York. He appears to have been something of a ladies man in his youth ('The Bow Wow Affair). In the first two seasons Waverly is depicted as an unsentimental, tough, pragmatic leader. By the third season, however, he is presented as a more humane, although still pragmatic character. In the third season two-part episode 'The Concrete Overcoat Affair,' Solo objects to the fact that his partner Kuryakin has been sent on a suicide mission. Although he chastises the agent for questioning his authority, Waverly allows him to go to Kuryakin's aid. As Solo leaves, Waverly can be heard muttering, \\"Alexander Waverly, sentimental grandmother of the year.\\" Although primarily working out of headquarters, on rare occasions Waverly joins in missions in the field. He goes undercover in 'The Pieces of Fate Affair' and during the show's fourth season, he is captured along with three of his agents. He masterminds their escape with the aid of a blade hidden in a flower in his buttonhole ('The Deep Six Affair'). Afterlife In 1968, Carroll made his final appearance in the role one week after the show's cancellation when he appeared on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, the series that replaced U.N.C.L.E. His final lines on screen are \\"Mr. Kuryakin, come quick. I think I've found THRUSH headquarters at last.\\" Carroll died in 1972 and his character did not appear in the 1983 reunion movie Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.:The Fifteen Years Later Affair where it is implied that Mr. Waverly had died relatively recently. Film Hugh Grant portrayed Waverly in The Man from U.N.C.L.E., a feature film adaptation of the TV series of the same name.

A development by Gloster Aircraft Company of the earlier Nieuport Nighthawk fighter, 50 aircraft were built by Gloster for the Imperial Japanese Navy, with a further 40 being assembled in Japan, being operated from 1921 to 1928. Development and design Captain Sempill showing a Sparrowhawk to Admiral Togo Heihachiro, 1921. When the British aircraft manufacturer Nieuport & General closed down in 1920, the services of its chief designer, Henry Folland were hired by the Gloster Aircraft Company, who also acquired the rights for Nieuport's Nighthawk fighter, a promising design that had been ruined by the use of the unreliable ABC Dragonfly radial engine. Folland used the Nighthawk as the basis for a series of developments known as the Gloster Mars series, with both air racer and fighters being produced.Mason 1992, p.152. When, in 1921, Britain sent the Sempill Mission to Japan to allow the Japanese to develop a Naval Air Arm, Gloster was able to meet the requirements of the Imperial Japanese Navy for a single-seat fighter by a modification of the Nighthawk.James 1971, p.75. The resulting Sparrowhawk was made from existing stocks of stored Nighthawk components, but replaced the Dragonfly with the Bentley BR2 rotary engine, allowing Japan's order for 50 Gloster built aircraft and a further 40 in component form for manufacture at the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal to be quickly met. Of the 50 Gloster- built Sparrowhawks, 30 were Sparrowhawk I land based fighters, ten Sparrowhawk II twin-seat advanced trainers and the remaining ten completed as Sparrowhawk III shipboard fighters. The Sparrowhawk IIIs, which were similar to the 22 Gloster Nightjar carrier fighters produced to operate from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers, were fitted with appropriate flotation equipment and arrestor gear. The 40 Yokosuka assembled aircraft were completed as Sparrowhawk Is. A single additional Sparrowhawk II was built by Glosters as a civil demonstrator. This aircraft, registered G-EAYN flew in the 1922 Aerial Derby around London, and was later converted to form the prototype Gloster Grouse.Jackson 1973, p.335. Operational history The Sparrowhawk entered service with the Japanese Navy in 1921, with the ten Sparrowhawk IIIs being used for flight training operations from ramps built on one of the gun turrets of the battleship Yamashiro, as the carrier H≈çsh≈ç was not yet ready. Although used for training from the Yamashiro, the Sparrowhawks were never operated from the H≈çsh≈ç, it being replaced for shipboard operations by the purpose- designed Mitsubishi 1MF fighter before H≈çsh≈ç entered service. The Sparrowhawk continued in service from shore bases until 1928, when it was retired from use as a trainer. Variants ;Sparrowhawk I : Also known as Mars II.

It is based on the 2002 novel of the same name by Valerio Massimo Manfredi. It stars Colin Firth, Ben Kingsley, Aishwarya Rai, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Peter Mullan, Kevin McKidd, John Hannah, and Iain Glen. It premiered in Abu Dhabi on 6 April 2007. The film is loosely inspired by the events of 5th-century European history, notably the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. This is coupled with other facts and legends from the history of Britain and fantastic elements from the legend of King Arthur to provide a basis for the Arthurian legend.  Plot  The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in AD 475. Having travelled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \\"magic\\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply is an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for \\"he who is destined to rule\\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon. The two are rescued from Capri by the loyal Aurelius and three surviving legionaries, Vatrenus, Batiatus, and Demetrius, accompanied by a female agent of the Eastern Roman Empire ‚Äì an Indian warrior named Mira. They take Romulus to a seaport where the Eastern Roman Empire's emissary (whom Mira works for) and the senator Nestor have promised safe passage to Constantinople. However, they barely escape after they learn the Senate and the Eastern Empire have betrayed them and sided with Odoacer. Ambrosinus persuades Romulus to seek refuge in Britain, where the Ninth Legion (called the Dragon Legion) may remain loyal, being far from the events. They are followed by Wulfila and his men; the Goth covets Caesar's sword after learning the prophecy. Crossing the Alps and the English Channel, the party travels to Hadrian's Wall and initially find no evidence of the legion until a farmer approaches and reveals he was its commanding general. With the collapse of Roman support of Britain, the legion had decided to disband and settle as farmers. Most of the men in the legion had married and had families. They also did not want to antagonise the powerful warlord Vortgyn. During their stay in the small Celtic village, Romulus meets and befriends a young girl named Igraine. Aurelius and Mira practice swordfighting and become close to each other. Ambrosinus told Romulus of a scar on his chest, similar to the design on the sword hilt, which he received from Vortgyn after he refused to tell him where the sword of Caesar was. Vortgyn also desires the sword of Caesar as he aspires to rule the whole of Britain. It is revealed that Vortgyn and Ambrosinus are old enemies. After meeting with the Goths, Vortgyn decides to either capture or kill Romulus as a gesture to Odoacer. After confronting Igraine outside of the village, he convinces her to tell everyone in the village to surrender Romulus and has several of his men kill the blacksmith's wife and sons. When a tearful Igraine tells the villagers of what has happened, Aurelius confesses that Romulus is the emperor of Rome. The blacksmith then demands revenge on his wife's and sons' deaths, and Aurelius and his men decide to lead an army to Hadrian's Wall to face Vortgyn's armies in one final battle. Before leaving the village, Romulus receives from Igraine a suit of Roman armour which belonged to her brother, which he has since outgrown. Aurelius, wielding Caesar's sword, leads his men and a small number of Celtic warriors against Vortgyn's forces at Hadrian's Wall. Mira, Batiatus, Demetrius, Romulus, and the archers pelt the infantry with arrows, while Aurelius, Vatrenus, and several Celtic soldiers struggled to hold the charging enemy at the open gate. Despite their casualties, Vortgyn's soldiers began to slowly overwhelm the small force on the wall. The battle appears hopeless until the rest of the Ninth Legion, having taken up their old Roman arms and uniforms, appear on the nearby ridgeline, and turn the tide of battle. The two warring sides cease their hostilities upon sighting Ambrosinus holding aloft Vortgyn's golden mask, after confronting and burning him alive at a tree- sanctuary of his secret brotherhood close to the battlefield. After having fought and severely injured Aurelius, Wulfila is confronted by Romulus who is armed with Caesar's sword. Romulus stabs Wulfila in the chest, saying \\"that's for my mother\\", pauses, and further impales him, saying \\"that's for my father\\". He tells Aurelius that he fought like a dragon, whereupon Aurelius replies that Romulus fought like the son of a dragon. Repulsed by the deaths in the battle, Romulus heaves away his sword which remarkably pierces a large rock and becomes lodged there. Many years later, Ambrosinus, now known by his Druid name, Merlin, takes a young boy to the battlefield to describe the now legendary events. Merlin, who has visibly aged little since the battle, says that Aurelius married Mira and the two raised Romulus as their own son. He became a wise ruler, took the girl Igraine as his wife, and adopted the name \\"Pendragon\\". The boy, Arthur, recognises Romulus as his father and Igraine as his mother. In a final scene, the sword of Julius Caesar is shown embedded in the stone, with moss growing on the blade, covering the original inscription, leaving only the Latin letters which, when read as a single word, read Excalibur.

Retrieved 1 January 2008. For the role of Aurelius, executive producer Harvey Weinstein suggested Colin Firth, known for playing Fitzwilliam Darcy in Pride and Prejudice (1995) and more recently, Mark Darcy in the Bridget Jones films. Firth accepted the role due to the story, which he liked, and that it was very different from previous roles. Thomas Sangster (Romulus) was one of the last to be cast. He had previously worked with Firth in Love Actually (2003) and Nanny McPhee (2006), and their familiarity with each other benefited both. Sir Ben Kingsley was cast as Ambrosinus/Merlin after one meeting with Lefler. Kingsley was drawn to the mystique of the character, whom Lefler describes as a \\"warrior shaman\\". Kingsley also found the story interesting. Aishwarya Rai was cast as Mira after the filmmakers decided \\"somebody that had a rare beauty... who could move very well\\", in Lefler's words, was ideal for the role. Lefler touted Rai's training in dance as an asset for her fight scenes. Like Firth, Rai took the role as a change of pace from her previous work. The film's costumes were designed by Paolo Scalabrino, who had worked on Gangs of New York and Troy. Lefler wanted each character to have a unique fighting style. Richard Ryan served as the film's sword master, helping him plan the fight scenes; he had worked on Troy and would work on Stardust as such. The film's score was composed by Patrick Doyle.

For the 1957 model year, Mercury created a model range of station wagons distinct from sedans, following Ford (and later Edsel). The Voyager served as the mid-range offering, slotted above the base-trim Mercury Commuter, with the woodgrained Colony Park serving as the top-range offering. For the 1959 model year, Ford consolidated the station wagon nameplates of its non-Lincoln divisions, with the Voyager withdrawn alongside the Ford Del Rio, Edsel Roundup, and Edsel Bermuda.  Design overview  Following the 1956 introduction of the hardtop station wagon by Rambler, in 1957, Mercury became the first American manufacturer to produce its entire station wagon line in a hardtop bodystyle. Serving as the mid-range Mercury station wagon, the Voyager was trimmed between the Mercury Monterey and Mercury Montclair sedans.  Chassis  As with the Commuter, Colony Park, and Mercury sedans of the time, the 1957-1958 Mercury Voyager was constructed using a body-on-frame chassis. Sharing its chassis with the rest of the Mercury range, the Voyager is built on a 122-inch wheelbase. During its production, the Voyager was offered exclusively with V8 engines. For 1957, the standard engine was a 312 cubic-inch \\"Safety-Surge\\" V8, producing 255 hp, with a 368 cubic-inch \\"Turnpike Cruiser\\" V8 producing 290 hp as an option. For 1958, Mercury revised its engine offerings, introducing the MEL-series V8. A 383 cubic-inch \\"Marauder\\" V8 producing 330 hp, was standard for the Voyager, with a 430 cubic-inch \\"Super Marauder\\" V8 was an option, producing 400 hp. The Super Marauder V8 was notable for becoming the first American mass-produced engine to reach an output of 400 hp. For all four V8 engines, a 3-speed \\"Merc- O-Matic\\" automatic transmission was used. In a break from Ford and Edsel, Mercury used dashboard-mounted push-button controls for the automatic transmission.  Body design  During its production, the Voyager was offered in two body configurations: two-door and four-door. Produced solely as a pillarless hardtop, a forward-facing third-row seat was offered on four-door Voyagers, expanding seating capacity from six to nine. In a design that would be modified on later Ford/Mercury station wagons, the rear window lowers into the tailgate, which folds flat against the load floor. For 1958, the exterior underwent a minor revision. Along with the standardization of quad headlamps, more conservative front styling was added. While the revision was centered around an effort to better integrate the grille and front bumper, the \\"pie- wedge\\" taillamps were replaced by a \\"rocket-style\\" design, along with additional chrome trim on the C-pillar.

The killings were conducted on August 27 and August 28, 1941, in the Soviet city of Kamianets- Podilskyi (now Ukraine), occupied by German troops in the previous month on July 11, 1941. Also in: According to the Nazi German reports a total of 23,600 Jews were murdered, including 16,000 who had earlier been expelled from Hungary. History The city of Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kam'yanets'-Podil's'kyy), now in south-western Ukraine, was part of the Ukrainian SSR invaded by German forces on June 22, 1941 during the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa launched from occupied Poland. Shortly after Hungary (Germany's ally) engaged in war on the Soviet Union on June 27, 1941, officials of the agency responsible for the foreign nationals living in Hungary decided to deport foreign Jews; these were mostly Polish and Russian Jews, but there were also many refugees from western Europe. Jews who could not readily establish Hungarian citizenship were equally vulnerable to deportation. As a result, many Hungarian Jews who could not document their citizenship were also deported. Many Jewish communities, especially in Governorate of Subcarpathia (then as part of Hungary), were deported in their entirety. The Hungarians loaded the Jews into freight cars and took them to K≈ër√∂smez≈ë (now Yasinia, Ukraine), near the prewar Hungarian-Polish border, where they were transferred across the former Soviet border and handed over to the Germans. By August 10, 1941, approximately 14,000 Jews had been deported from Hungary to German-controlled territory. Once in German hands, the Jews, often still in family units, were forced to march from Kolomyia to Kamianets- Podilskyi. On August 27 and 28, a detachment of Einsatzgruppen (mobile killing units) in Kamianets-Podilskyi and troops under the command of the Higher SS and Police Leader for the southern region, SS General Friedrich Jeckeln, carried out mass murder of the entire Jewish community including both deportees and locals. According to Jeckeln's report, a total of 23,600 Jews were massacred in this action. It was one of the first large-scale mass murder operations in pursuit of the Final Solution in Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Within the Soviet Union grounds, it was preceded by a similar killing spree which began on July 9, 1941, and continued until September 19, in the city of Zhytomyr (made Judenfrei) with three mass-murder operations conducted by German and Ukrainian police in which 10,000 Jews perished. It was followed by the killing of 28,000 Jews shot by SS and the Ukrainian paramilitary in Vinnytsia on September 22, 1941, and the September 29 massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar.

The magazine provides an avenue through which sellers, traders and avid buyers of Sports cards and other memorabilia may interact.  History and profile  SCD was started in 1973 by the Stommen family. In 1981 it was purchased by Krause Publications; Krause was acquired by F+W Media, its current publisher, in 2002. The thickness of the magazine has varied throughout the years, and could arguably be seen as a reflection of the sports collecting market. For example, the July 13, 1990 issue contained 332 pages; however, the January 22, 2010 issue was only 36 pages long. Accounts of some athletes of the past and their activities festoon some of the pages. Other issues are written similarly. Pages are 11x14 inches (28x35.5 cm). SCD has long billed itself as \\"The Voice of the Hobby\\" and mixes hobby news with features, collecting stories, athlete profiles and opinion. The magazine is one of the few publications that have been successful in the sports card and memorabilia hobby. Its accompanying website offers content similar to the magazine, with an Auction Prices Realized database that is the only one of its kind in the hobby. The site also offers videos, blogs, features and a forum. Classified ads remain a staple of the magazine, although it is rare when classifieds fill a full page. Many collectors have relied on the SCD classifieds over the years to build and maintain their collections. Before the Internet, it was a major source for buyers and sellers in the hobby to network. The magazine remains the sports collecting hobby's leading news publication with a loyal subscriber base. SCD has been effected by the trend toward selling collectibles on the Internet. Issues have shrunk, and the publication rarely features fresh editorial product. In recent issues, editors have recycled 10-year-old, previously-published interviews. Correspondents who provided columns and features were dropped for budgetary reasons and most of the limited editorial content is produced in-house.

It is one of the four parts that make up an ISDA Master Agreement but is not mandatory. It is possible to have an ISDA agreement without a CSA but normally not a CSA without an ISDA. Essentially, a CSA defines the terms or rules under which collateral is posted or transferred between swap counterparties to mitigate the credit risk arising from \\"in the money\\" derivative positions. If on any Valuation Date, the Delivery Amount equals or exceeds the Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, the Pledgor must transfer Eligible Collateral with a Value at least equal to the Delivery Amount. The Delivery Amount is the amount the Credit Support Amount exceeds the Value of all posted Collateral held by the Secured Party. The Credit Support Amount is the Secured Party's Exposure plus Pledgor's Independent Amounts minus Secured Party's Independent Amounts minus the Pledgor's Threshold. The Collateral must meet the Eligibility criteria in the agreement, e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which haircuts are applied. There are also rules for the settlement of disputes arising over valuation of derivative positions. To distinguish between the Schedule to the Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex, the schedules are numbered as Parts and CSA are numbered as Paragraphs. To customise the requirements of an OTC Transaction, the clauses which are required are added as Paragraph 11 (for London Agreements) and as Paragraph 13 (for New York Agreements). Under English Law, CSA are considered transactions: Any collateral listed as ‚ÄòEligible Collateral‚Äô is delivered as an outright transfer of title. The collateral taker becomes the outright owner of that collateral free of any third party interest. Compare the \\"Outright transfer\\" offered under English Law Credit Support Annex with \\"Security Interest\\" under New York Law Credit Support Annex.

He played football as a tackle and center for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1941 to 1943 and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1943. He was inducted into the United States Navy and served in the Pacific Theater during World War II, narrowly surviving a kamikaze attack on his ship in 1945. Pregulman was a first-round draft pick (seventh overall pick) of the Green Bay Packers in the 1944 NFL Draft. He played four years of professional football with the Packers (1946), Detroit Lions (1947‚Äì48), and New York Bulldogs (1949). He later became the president of Siskin Steel & Supply Co.in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was also active in philanthropy and community service, including service as president of the Siskin Foundation and a member of the University of Chattanooga Foundation's board of trustees. In 2004, he became the 13th recipient of the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford Award. He was also inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. Childhood Merv Pregulman was born on October 22, 1922 and raised in Lansing, Michigan. He was born with Jewish ancestry. His father, George Pregulman, had little formal education, but became a millionaire through his business ventures. Pregulman went to Lansing Central High School, which was close to the campus of Michigan State University (then known as Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science). In his senior year of high school, Pregulman was \\"captain of the all-state football team\\". College football Despite growing up and attending high school close to Michigan State, Pregulman chose to attend the University of Michigan. At Michigan, he played for Coach Fritz Crisler from 1941‚Äì43. He was a versatile lineman who \\"moved from guard to tackle to center as needed, and who played each position with skill, confidence and winning effectiveness.\\" 1941 season In 1941, Pregulman was a 19-year-old sophomore starting at right guard. On October 18, 1941, he intercepted a pass thrown by College and Pro Football Hall of Famer Otto Graham and ran it back for the game-winning touchdown in a 14‚Äì7 victory over Northwestern. That year, Pregulman was named a Grantland Rice All-American honorable mention and was given the team's Meyer Morton Award as the most improved player during spring drills. The 1941 Michigan team finished the year with a record of 6‚Äì1‚Äì1, outscored its opponents 147‚Äì41, and was ranked No. 5 in the final AP poll. 1942 season In 1942, the Michigan team was 7‚Äì3 and finished the season ranked No. 7 in the AP poll. Michigan played the Notre Dame Fighting Irish for the first time in 25 years and won, 32‚Äì20. Pregulman was named to the All Big Ten team. The 1942 Wolverines' offensive line that included Pregulman, Julius Franks (U-M's first African-American All-American), Al Wistert, Robert Kolesar, Bill Pritula and Elmer Madar, was known as the \\"Seven Oak Posts.\\" 1943 season In 1943, the Michigan football team was 8‚Äì1, outscored its opponents, 302‚Äì73, and was co-champion of the Big Ten Conference, finishing the season ranked No. 3 in the final AP poll. The only loss was to Notre Dame, 35‚Äì12. The Wolverines did not allow any other opponent to score more than seven points that season and defeated Minnesota, 49‚Äì6, and Ohio State 45‚Äì7. For the 1943 season, Pregulman was named Grantland Rice first team All- American at guard, UP All-American second team at tackle, and AP All-American third team at tackle. Awards and accolades His biography at the University of Michigan Athletic History site says: \\"Originally a center he was shifted to guard, then back to center where his accurate passes were a vital factor in Michigan's famed single-winged attack. Smart and aggressive, he never turned in a performance below the high standard he set for himself.\\" Sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote that Pregulman was \\"fast and alert ‚Ä¶ was voted the best combination center, guard, and tackle the Middlewest had known in years.\\" In addition to his father, Pregulman said he had three heroes in his life: Michigan Coach Fritz Crisler, Michigan's line coach (and future Michigan State head coach) Biggie Munn, and Axle Martin, a university professor. In 1969, Pregulman was selected for the Michigan Wolverines' all- time football team. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982 and the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in 1988. He was also part of the second group inducted into the Michigan Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2005, Pregulman was selected as one of the 100 greatest Michigan football players of all time by the \\"Motown Sports Revival,\\" ranking 61st on the all-time team. Service in World War II In 1944, Pregulman entered the United States Navy where he served as a gunnery officer on the USS Taluga in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The Taluga left Norfolk, Virginia in October 1944. On December 10, 1944, the ship reached Ulithi, an atoll in the Caroline Islands in the western Pacific Ocean, which served as the ship's base of operations until the end of World War II. For the next 11 months, Pregulman and the Taluga crew were in and out of Ulithi picking up oil and other supplies and delivering them to units of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During that time, they supported carrier strikes and landings on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, landings on Okinawa, strikes on Formosa, and the final sweep of the Japanese home islands in the summer of 1945. Between April and July 1945, Pregulman and the Taluga crew spent much of their time in and around the anchorage at Kerama Retto, just west of the southern end of Okinawa. At dawn on April 16, 1945, ten kamikazes attacked their formation. One of the kamikazes dove at Taluga, strafed the deck, and then made for the superstructure. The attacker careened off the ship's bridge and hit the wheelhouse. However, only 12 men were injured, and the oiler was soon back in action. Pregulman normally would have been in the wheelhouse, but he went on deck just before the attack. He recalled: \\"If he had been five minutes later, I would have been in the wheelhouse and I certainly wouldn't be here\\". He recalled that the plane sheared off the top of the wheelhouse, and blew a hole in the deck, but no American soldiers were killed. Just 11 days after the cessation of hostilities, Taluga entered Tokyo Bay on August 26, 1945, and took up duty as station oiler until early October. On November 18, 1945, the ship left Japan to support ships engaged in the occupation of China and Korea. The ship visited Tsingtao and Jinsen before returning to Yokosuka, Japan, on December 6, 1945. On January 31, 1946, the Taluga began its return to the United States, arriving in San Pedro, California, on February 16. Professional football Merv Pregulman 1948 Bowman football card Green Bay Packers Pregulman was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the first round (seventh choice overall) of the 1944 NFL Draft, but was called into military service in the Navy. After completing his military service, Pregulman finally signed with the Packers in June 1946. A Wisconsin sports writer touted the signing: \\"Curly Lambeau came up with a dandy for the Green Bay Packers when he landed Merv Pregulman. ‚Ä¶ At Michigan he was a star at three different positions -- tackle, guard and center. I've a hunch that he would do just as well at end.\\" Pregulman appeared in nine games for a Packers' team that had a 6‚Äì5 record in 1946. Detroit Lions During the spring of 1947, Pregulman joined the coaching staff of the Michigan State Spartans football team when Biggie Munn took over as head coach. Munn had been Pregulman's position coach at Michigan. In June 1947, Pregulman was traded by the Packers to the Detroit Lions in exchange for his former teammate at Michigan, Paul White. Pregulman played in all 24 games for the Lions during the 1947 and 1948 seasons. The Lions went 3‚Äì9 in 1947 and 2‚Äì10 in 1948. Pregulman had three interceptions and recovered three fumbles for the Lions. He also handled the Lions' kicking duties in 1948, kicking two field goals in six attempts, and completing 26 extra points in 27 attempts. He also had a punt return for nine yards (eight m) in 1947. New York Bulldogs In August 1949, Pregulman was traded by the Lions to the New York Bulldogs in exchange for John Treadaway and John Prochlik. He played in all 12 games for the Bulldogs team that went 1‚Äì10‚Äì1. In June 1950, Pregulman announced that he was retiring from football. He said he had received a contract to play for the Philadelphia Eagles, but had decided to remain in Lansing, Michigan, where he was in the furniture business. Business career After his football career ended, Pregulman initially went into the furniture business. In 1957, Pregulman moved with his wife Helen to her hometown, Chattanooga, Tennessee. His wife was the granddaughter of Robert Hyman Siskin, the founder of Siskin Steel & Supply Co. The company was started in 1900 by Siskin, a Lithuanian immigrant, as a small scrap metal business. His two sons, Mose and Garrison Siskin expanded the company into one of Chattanooga's leading businesses. In 1978, when Mose Siskin died, Pregulman was named president and chief executive officer. In 1980, Siskin was generating about $50 million in annual revenues. Under Pregulman's management over the next 15 years the company's annual revenues tripled to $151 million, as the company expanded its operations throughout the Southeast. In 1985, Siskin bought Birmingham, Alabama-based Steel Supply Company, which subsequently took on the Siskin name. Next, Siskin built a steel service center in Nashville in 1989 to cut transportation costs and accommodate Nissan Motors and Saturn Corporation automobile plants in the area. When Pregulman retired, his son John Pregulman took over as the company's president. In 1996, Siskin Steel was sold to Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. for $71 million in cash. Under an agreement with Reliance Steel, the company remained under local management with Merv Pregulman continuing to serve as vice-chairman, and his son John Pregulman continuing as president. In 2002, John Pregulman left Siskin. Philanthropy and community service Pregulman was also active in philanthropy and community service. For many years, he was the chairman of the Siskin Memorial Foundation and played a lead role in building the Siskin Hospital for Physical Rehabilitation, one of the leading rehabilitation centers in the United States. Even after he retired, he remained active as the Foundation's vice-chairman. He was also president of the Jewish Community Federation of Chattanooga, a member of the University of Chattanooga Foundation's board of trustees, and a leader at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and The McCallie School, a boy's preparatory school near his home in the Missionary Ridge section of Chattanooga. He also played an important role in raising money to build Finley Stadium, opened in 1997, and has served on the board of directors for the Finley Stadium/Davenport Field Corporation. Pregulmanparticularly active in community service efforts directed at improving health care and has received awards from the Tennessee Medical Association and the Chattanooga/Hamilton County Medical Society. In 1997, Pregulman and his wife were given Chattanooga's top philanthropist honor at the 10th Annual National Philanthropy Day Luncheon and Award presentation, for their varied efforts since moving to Chattanooga in 1957. After his wife spoke, Pregulman told the attendees: \\"Helen (his wife) comes by charity work very honestly. When you talk about philanthropy and community there's no need to write them down on paper, the words come from the heart.\\" In 1998, Pregulman and his wife Helen (also a U-M graduate) endowed a scholarship at the University of Michigan. The Mervin and Helen S. Pregulman Endowed Scholarship Fund is awarded based on students' leadership ability, financial need, and commitment to work in the Jewish community after graduation. Pregulman said: \\"Helen and I are committed to Jewish communal service. We see it as essential to the health and vitality of the Jewish communities throughout the world. The students ‚Ä¶ will play an integral role in administration and related activities at synagogues and Jewish Community Centers in the future. We hope to encourage more leadership from our young adults through this scholarship program.\\" In 2004, Pregulman was the 13th person to receive the Gerald R. Ford Award. The award is the highest honor bestowed on a former University of Michigan athlete and is given for \\"excellence in scholarship, sport and society.\\" Pregulman was also a vocal opponent of efforts in 2005 to impose historic district zoning restrictions on the Missionary Ridge area of Chattanooga, where Pregulman lives. The ridge was the site of a Civil War battle and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Pregulman argued that historic zoning would limit the rights of property owners: \\"We live with enough restrictions. We don't need them.\\" A transcript of an interview with Pregulman is part of the American Jewish Committee Oral History Collection at the New York Public Library.

According to estimations, 1.5 million children, nearly all Jewish, were murdered during the Holocaust, either directly or as a direct consequence of Nazi actions. The Nazis advocated killing children of unwanted or \\"dangerous\\" in accordance with their ideological views, either as part of the Nazi idea of the racial struggle or as a measure of preventive security. The Nazis particularly targeted Jewish children, but also targeted ethnically Polish children and Romani (also called Gypsy) children along with children with mental or physical defects (disabled children). The Nazis and their collaborators killed children both for these ideological reasons and in retaliation for real or alleged partisan attacks.CHILDREN DURING THE HOLOCAUST Early killings were encouraged by the Nazis in action T4, where children with disabilities were gassed using carbon monoxide, starved to death, given phenol injections to the heart, or hanged. 1,500,000 children, nearly all Jewish, were killed by the Nazis. A much smaller number were saved. Some simply survived, often in a ghetto, occasionally in a concentration camp. Some were saved in various programs like the Kindertransport and the One Thousand Children, in both of which children fled their homeland. Other children were saved by becoming Hidden Children. During and even before the war many vulnerable children were rescued by ≈íuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE).  Segregation in schools  Segregation in schools began in April 1933 when the \\"Law Against Overcrowding in German schools\\" was enacted. A restriction was set that allowed only 1.5 percent of Jewish children to be enrolled in public schools; at the time, five percent of the children in Germany were of Jewish descent. The Nazis continued to \\"Aryanize\\" as their regime progressed. Jewish children were required to learn from different sources than their classmates. Many Jewish children were also given worse grades than their peers, indiscriminately with regards to the quality of their work. Jewish children were not allowed to participate in most school activities; many were segregated from former friends. As time passed, most teachers incorporated more elements of the Nazi ideology in their classrooms; once quieter in their beliefs, they started using anti-Semitic terms in class. Poor treatment of Jewish children was more common in rural schools, but there was also discrimination in large cities. Many Jewish students felt distant from their classmates. Some Jewish children began to form small strikes in their schools, leaving without permission during class when anti-Semitic elements were used. Others tried to conform with no success, and some parents just took their children out of school. Many mothers were horrified to find out that their children were being emotionally and physically attacked by their classmates and teachers for being Jewish. Mothers were more likely to take their children out of school than fathers, seeing and hearing from their children the majority of what actually happened at school. Eventually Jewish schools were built, and the Jewish community supported the idea of teaching their children without fear of persecution. Consequently, the number of children going to private school increased from 14 percent in 1932 to 52 percent in 1936. While most were happy that their children could learn, many parents feared that the segregation of the Jewish community from the Aryan community was a goal of the Nazis. Causes of death German forces established ghettos early in the war in many Polish towns and cities such as Warsaw and ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In them, Jewish children died from starvation and exposure as well as lack of adequate clothing and shelter. The German authorities were indifferent to this mass death because they considered most of the younger ghetto children to be unproductive and hence \\"useless eaters\\". Strict control was enforced over the inhabitants of the ghettos, and the food provided was deliberately limited. From 1942 onwards, the ghetto program ended. Inhabitants of the ghettos were murdered at various death camps. Because children were generally too young to be deployed as forced labor, they were particularly vulnerable to being killed: they were one of the main groups in the first deportations to killing centers or in mass shootings near mass graves along with the elderly, the ill, and the disabled.Doin‚Äô it for the kids! Children who were healthy enough for labor were often worked to death doing jobs to benefit the camp; other times, children were forced to do unnecessary jobs like digging ditches. Non-Jewish children from certain other targeted groups were not spared. In the Auschwitz concentration camp, Romani children were killed. Meanwhile, five to seven thousand children died as victims of a \\"euthanasia\\" program. Others were murdered in reprisals, including most of the children of Lidice; many children in villages in the occupied parts of the Soviet Union were killed with their parents. During the Holocaust, children were more susceptible to the harm they were going to face because of the vulnerable state they were in. More than 1.5 million Jews died in the Holocaust. There are only few children that were saved in the war through programs such as Kinderspart and One Thousand Holocaust. Other children survived on their own by staying in the concentration camps or in the ghetto. Robert Krell, a holocaust survivor was 5 years old when the war was occurring. His parents sacrificed leaving their only son so he could be safe during the war and brought him to the Muniks, a family friend that would keep his son safe. At the time Robert and his innocence did not know what was occurring, but with time he learned he was a Jew and the Munik family would help keep him safe. Robert never felt that he could express the terror he felt, but he restrained his emotions to use them when the time was right. When the war ended, Robert had to return to his parents, but he found it pointless because all of his family had been murdered. Robert was comfortable with the Muniks because they felt like home. After the Roberts return home other survivors also returned to their home. There were child survivors that would share their stories, but the few that did not remember were told they were lucky to not remember such a horrific experience. Those that did remember had trauma, but receive little or no help. Robert expresses that because of the trauma some children remained silent because for the people that would try to help them it was hard to hear. The silence among themselves caused painful memories they did not understand, 93 percent of children Jews were murdered in the war. Those that cause harm to them was with a ferocity that they would be held accountable for. In 1951 Robert and his parents had migrated to Canada where he would feel liberated. He adapted to Canada and their language, but would still see the murders through the eyes of the holocaust survivors. In 1981 there was the First World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors in Jerusalem. Robert met the youngest survivor of Buchenwald, Rabbi Israel Meier. At the time Rabbi was 8years old and Robert was 5. A year passed and Robert had the idea to found \\"Child Holocaust Survivors' Group of Los Angeles'‚Äô. Later he put together a panel in 1984 where child survivors, psychiatrist, and psychologist would speak in the \\"American Psychiatric Therapy Association\\". There in estimation that about 1,600 people had attended who were holocaust survivors. The panel impacted the children survivors because Robert explains they finally \\"found their voice\\" because they were all together. Only they were the ones that knew what they experienced and those experienced caused them to express themselves. They did not enjoy sharing the unpleasant memories, but they felt that together they needed to tackle a problem they had with their identity and faith and the memories they were faced with. Since the first panel, they have made it an annual event that has been held in Los Angeles, Toronto, Prague, Amsterdam, Montreal, Jerusalem, Houston, and Cracow. Dr Robert Krell was one of the few who survived the Holocaust and became a Professor at Emeritus Psychiatry in the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. With the memories Robert had, it helped him move forward and start panels where others who were in the same situation could express themselves.  Medical incidents  Ghetto Litzmannstadt. Children rounded up for deportation to the Kulmhof extermination camp. Jewish twins kept alive to be used in Mengele's medical experiments. These children were liberated from Auschwitz by the Red Army in January 1945. The German authorities also incarcerated a number of children in concentration camps and transit camps. Physicians and medical researchers of the Schutzstaffel (SS), a Nazi paramilitary organization, used children, especially twins, in concentration camps for medical experiments that often resulted in the deaths of the children. In their \\"search to retrieve 'Aryan blood'\\", or the perfect race, SS race experts ordered hundreds of children in occupied Poland and the occupied parts of the Soviet Union to be kidnapped and transferred to the Reich to be adopted by racially suitable German families. Although the basis for these decisions was \\"race-scientific,\\" often blond hair, blue eyes, or fair skin was sufficient to merit the \\"opportunity\\" to be \\"Germanized.\\" On the other hand, female Poles and Soviet civilians who had been deported to Germany for forced labor were often forced sexual relations with a German man; many cases resulted in pregnancy, and the women were forced to have abortions or to bear their children under conditions that would ensure the infant's death, if the race experts determined that the child would have insufficient German blood.  Transit camps  Transit camps were temporary stops on the way to concentration camps during the Holocaust. Many children were brought with their families to transit camps, unsure of what awaited them. Some hoped for starting a new life and making friends in the camps, while many others were scared. Children brought to the transit camps came from many different backgrounds. In the transit camps, children were surrounded by bare bodies. Their beds were merely metal frames. There was a lack of food along with a fear of trains coming for deportation. No school supplies were provided. Children began to see their relatives in a different light because each family member dealt with various hardships in the transit camps.Dwork, Deborah. \\"Transit Camps.\\" Children with a Star: Jewish Youth in Nazi Europe, Yale University Press, 1993, pp. 113‚Äì154. Children had few resources at the transit camps to foster growth. A group of Hungarian Zionists made a rescue committee to negotiate and prevent deportations. Older girls took care of young children. Physicians, nurses, and musicians organized lectures, concerts, and activities for children. Voluntary interns and philanthropic organizations supplied food, clothing, and organized secretive teaching rooms to help the children continue their education. Childcare workers taught children about the ideas of Zionism and the spirit of democracy; they additionally encouraged an affectionate atmosphere. These groups also helped ease the hunger issues in the camps. A notorious case of the Nazis holding a child in a transit camp is the case of Anne Frank and her sister in Bergen- Belsen. Other notable cases include the children held in the Majdanek concentration camp, some of whom were orphaned because their parents were killed in anti-partisan operations.\\"Lublin\\" chapter from Pinkas Hakehillot Polin (cont.)  Auschwitz and Josef Mengele  Czes≈Çawa Kwoka, child victim in Auschwitz Josef Mengele was a physician who worked at Auschwitz, a concentration camp. His research subjects were better fed and housed than other prisoners and temporarily safe from the gas chambers. He established a kindergarten for children who were the subjects of experiments, along with all Romani children under the age of six. The facility provided better food and living conditions than other areas of the camp and even included a playground. When visiting his child subjects, he introduced himself as \\"Uncle Mengele\\" and offered them sweets. However, he was also personally responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of victims. Author Robert Jay Lifton describes Mengele as sadistic, lacking empathy, and extremely anti-Semitic, claiming that he believed that the Jews should be eliminated entirely as an inferior and dangerous race. Mengele's son Rolf said that his father showed no remorse for his wartime activities. A lack of regulations on his experiments allowed Mengele to perform his experiments freely. A former Auschwitz prisoner doctor said: Photo from Mengele's Argentine identification document (1956) Mengele had a fascination with twins. He was interested in the difference between identical and fraternal twins as well as how genetic diseases affected them and where they originated. The experiments also distinguished between genetic traits and those developed by the environment of the child. Mengele was known to pretend to be off duty while a train of new prisoners arrived so that he could personally select any twins whom he saw. He operated on children, partly to find genetic weaknesses in the makeup of Jewish or Romani people in order to provide scientific evidence for the ideas of the Nazi party. Mengele hypothesized that his subjects were particularly vulnerable to certain diseases because of their race. In addition to that, he believed that they had degenerative blood and tissue based on his samples. Mengele or one of his assistants subjected twins to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes. He performed experiments such as unnecessary amputation of limbs; in another experiment, he intentionally infected a twin with typhus or another disease and transfused the blood of the infected twin into the other one. Many of his subjects died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected. Mikl√≥s Nyiszli, a prisoner at Auschwitz, recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night through a chloroform injection to the heart. If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative reports could be prepared after their deaths. He was known for experimenting with eyes. One of his particular studies regarded heterochromia iridum, a condition where people's eyes are differently colored. After he killed heterochromatics, he removed their eyes and sent them to Berlin for study. Another of Mengele's experiments with eyes involved attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals into the eyes of living subjects. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back-to-back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering. Sisak concentration camp During the existence of the Independent State of Croatia during World War II, the Croatian Usta≈°e established numerous concentration camps like those in Jasenovac, ƒêakovo, and Jastrebarsko in which many Serbian, Jewish, and Romani children died as inmates. Among them, there was Sisak concentration camp, which was specially formed for children as part of Jasenovac concentration camp.Marija Vuselica: Regionen Kroatien in Der Ort des Terrors: Arbeitserziehungslager, Ghettos, Jugendschutzlager, Polizeihaftlager, Sonderlager, Zigeunerlager, Zwangsarbeiterlager, Volume 9 of Der Ort des Terrors, Publisher C.H.Beck, 2009, pages 321-323Anna Maria Gr√ºnfelder: Arbeitseinsatz f√ºr die Neuordnung Europas: Zivil- und ZwangsarbeiterInnen aus Jugoslawien in der \\"Ostmark\\" 1938/41-1945, Publisher B√∂hlau Verlag Wien, 2010 pages 101-106 Children in Sisak children's concentration camp Sisak children's concentration camp was founded on 3 August 1942 following the Kozara Offensive. It was part of an assembly camp, officially named the \\"Refugee Transit Camp\\". This concentration camp consisted of a special part officially called the \\"Shelter for the Refugee Children\\" under the auspices of the \\"Ustasha Female Lineage\\" and \\"Ustasha Security Service\\", and under the direct control of Antun Naj≈æer. The camp was located in several buildings in Sisak: the former Yugoslav Falconry Association (\\"Sokolana\\"), the Sisters of St. Vincent nunnery, a rice warehouse, Rajs Saltworks warehouse, Novi Sisak elementary school, and the \\"Karantena\\" (Quarantine). All these buildings were considered unsuitable for the housing of children. For example, in the Falconry Association, there were no doors; it was drafty because it was built for drying salt. Children, even those who were only a few months old, had to lie on the floor with only a thin layer of straw without any clothes or blankets. When a typhus epidemic broke out, Naj≈æer ordered the transfer of the infected children to an improvised hospital, only serving to increase the number of deaths. The first group of children arrived on 3 August 1942; there were 906 of them. The very next day another group of 650 children was brought; a third group arrived on 6 August with 1,272 children. In Teslic glasshouse and the newly built barracks, which were named \\"Karantena\\", a general concentration camp for men, women, and children had been established. During August and September 1942, Usta≈°e took parents away from 3,971 children by sending the parents to forced labor. From August 1942 to 8 February 1943, there were 6,693 detained children, mostly Serbs from Kozara, Kordun, and Slavonia. Despite the actions of Diana Budisavljeviƒá and a group of humanitarians ‚Äì Jana Koh, Vera Luketiƒá, Dragica Habazin, Ljubica and Vera Beciƒá, Kamil Bresler, Ante Dumboviƒá, and the sisters of the Red Cross ‚Äì up to 40 children died every day. Dr. Lazar Margulje≈° testified about conditions at the concentration camp: Jana Koh, former secretary of Croatian Red Cross stated following about the conditions in the Camp: > The barracks were connected by the corridors guarded by the Ustashas. Not > far from the ambulance, from another barracks, the sad cries of the children > were heard. There was set, on the bare floor, four hundred children: > newborns, children from a few weeks or months, up to ten years of age. How > many children came, and where they were dispatched, could no longer be found > out. The children in the children's barracks cried inexorably and were > calling their mothers, who were only a few steps away from the children, but > the fascist criminals did not let mothers to approach their children. Older > children tell us through tears, that they can not calm the little ones, > because they are hungry, there are no one to change diapers of the little > ones, and they are afraid that everyone will die. These children, who have > not yet reached the age of ten, swear to us, \\"Come on, sister, bring us > mothers, bring at least mothers to these little ones. You will see, if you > do not bring them their mothers, they will suffocate, by the tears alone.\\" Coroner David Egiƒá officially recorded that out of 6,693 children, 1,152 died in the Camp, while teacher Ante Dumboviƒá later claimed that the number was 1,630.Review of International Affairs, Volume 33, Issues 762-785, Federation of Yugoslav Journalists, 1982 page 31 Means of survival In spite of their acute vulnerability, many children discovered ways to survive. Children smuggled food and medicine into the ghettos, in turn smuggling out their own personal possessions to trade for said goods. Children in youth movements later escaped the ghettos to join underground resistance activities such as Soviet partisan units; others formed their own units to harass the German occupiers. Many children escaped with parents or other relatives to family camps run by Jewish partisans; others had to escape on their own.Study Guide Sonia Orbuch: A Young Woman with the Russian Partisans Many Jewish children were forced to fake their identity for their own safety. They obtained false identity papers that usually came from anti-Nazi resistance in order to pretend to be Aryans. Even though this was one of the only ways to survive for children, it imposed major security risks. The police and other Nazi authorities closely examined documents in their search for Jews to detect disguised Jews. Circumcision, a Jewish tradition in which the foreskins of infant male Jews are removed, was an easy way to identify Jews because non- Jews usually did not go through the procedure. Boys had to be mindful about using public restrooms and participating in team sports because their Jewish identity could be exposed. As a solution, they had to go through additional procedures that would hide circumcision or at times even dress up as girls. The United States attempted to help Jewish children. Inspired by the Kindertransport, Congress was urged to allow up to 100,000 Jewish children to come to America. Efforts around the United States allowed the rescue of 1,000 Jewish children from Nazis. Unlike the English work, the actual rescue efforts were not backed up by the government in any way. Those who wanted to help had to find their own ways to fight immigration quotas. Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus were a couple who brought 50 Jewish children to the United States to save them from Nazis in 1939 before the war started. They selected the 50 children by interviewing their families, who were close to obtaining a US visa. Most of the children, who had moved to Philadelphia, were eventually reunited with their families. Between 1938 and 1939, the Kindertransport (Children's Transport) was a rescue effort organized by the British government in cooperation with Jewish organizations. It brought about 10,000 refugee Jewish children to safety in Great Britain from Nazi Germany and German-occupied territories, although their families did not come with them. Likewise, Youth Aliyah (Youth Immigration) was responsible for integrating thousands of children into life in Palestine for their survival as well as the revitalization of the Yishuv, the Jewish settlement in Palestine.Kaplan, Marion A. (1999). Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish life in Nazi Germany. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 116-117. Meanwhile, some non-Jews hid Jewish children; sometimes, as in the case of Anne Frank, they hid other family members as well. In some cases the Jews were actually hidden; in other cases, they were adopted into the family of their \\"hider\\". A unique case of hiding occurred in France. Almost the entire Protestant population of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, as well as many Catholic priests, nuns, and laymen, hid Jewish children in the town from 1942 to 1944. In Italy and Belgium, many children survived in hiding.Elizabeth Altham, Catholic Heroes of the Holocaust In Belgium, the Christian organization Jeunesse Ouvri√®re Chr√®tiene hid Jewish children and teenagers with the backing of the Queen-Mother Elisabeth of Belgium.Lazar Wall, \\"A survivor‚Äôs musical link to now\\", The Jewish Advocate, 12 December 2018 After the surrender of Nazi Germany, which ended World War II, refugees and displaced persons searched throughout Europe for missing children. Thousands of orphaned children were displaced in camps. Many surviving Jewish children fled eastern Europe as part of the mass exodus (Brihah) to the western zones of occupied Germany en route to the Yishuv. Youth Aliyah continued its activities after the war by helping child survivors to move to Palestine, which soon became the state of Israel in 1948.Dalia Ofer, Holocaust Survivors as Immigrants: The Case of Israel and the Cyprus DetaineesShivat Tzion- The Return to Zion  See also  *Bullenhuser Damm *CENTOS (charity) *Joseph Mengele *Kidnapping of Eastern European children by Nazi Germany *Nicholas Winton *Janusz Korczak *Bia≈Çystok children *One Thousand Children  References  External links  *‚ÄúNo Child‚Äôs Play‚Äù ‚Äì Children in the Holocaust: Creativity and Play an online exhibition by Yad Vashem *United States Holocaust Memorial Museum ‚Äì Article Children during the Holocaust; and online exhibitions Life in the Shadows; and Give Me Your Children *Holocaust Memorial Album Honoring more than 1.5 Million Souls Under 12 years of age that never returned ... from Holocaust Survivors and Remembrance Project: \\"Forget You Not\\" *Children and the Holocaust *Nazis kidnap Polish children * What Now?

It includes two species, the Kukwari sea catfish, A. phrygiatus, and the softhead sea catfish, A. rugispinis. Taxonomy A. phrygiatus and A. rugispinis were both originally described by Achille Valenciennes in 1840 as Arius species, where they have been traditionally placed. They have also been classified in the genus Notarius. Since then, it has been recognized that these two species form a natural, monophyletic grouping and were suggested to represent a new, undescribed genus. The genus Amphiarius was finally erected for these two species in 2007.

While playing for Larne he also worked as a booking clerk for the ferries between Larne and Stranraer in Scotland. His form with Larne earned him a call-up to Danny Blanchflower's Northern Ireland squad. However, although he played for Northern Ireland against Glentoran in a testimonial for Bobby McGregor in May 1977 he never made a full international appearance. Hagan joined Coventry City from Larne in November 1977 for a fee of ¬£25,000, making 13 league appearances the following season. He struggled to establish himself at Highfield Road and joined Torquay United on loan in September 1979 and was loaned to NASL side Detroit Express in March 1980. He joined Hong Kong side Seiko in October 1980 on an extended loan and helped the club to a clean-sweep of the Hong Kong League, Cup and Senior Cup. He returned to Coventry in July 1981, making three further league appearances and was included by Billy Bingham in Northern Ireland's provisional forty man squad for the 1982 World Cup Finals, but was cut when the final squad was announced. Hagan was released by Coventry at the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season and in May 1982 joined local rivals Birmingham City.

June 30, 1926 ‚Äì 28 August 1998) was a Russian submariner and a Captain First Rank in the Soviet Navy, notable as the commander of the ill-fated Soviet submarine K-19 in July 1961 during the Hotel class submarine's nuclear-reactor coolant leak. Zateyev and the actions of his crew managed to avert disaster, despite severe radiation exposure.Studios Fight To Tell Story of Submarine The St. Petersburg Times, retrieved August 9, 2007 After the event, Zateyev and his crew were sworn to secrecy by the Soviet government regarding the events that transpired, and were only permitted to reveal the story after its collapse. Zateyev later released his memoirs on the event, which were used as the basis for a number of literary works on the disaster, as well as a 2002 documentaryK-19: Doomsday Submarine IMDb retrieved August 11, 2007 and film.Interview With Peter Huchthausen CNN retrieved August 11, 2007 In these memoirs, Zateyev criticised the rushed production of Russia's first nuclear ballistic missile submarine.National Geographic K-19 The History: 1958-60: The Construction of K-19 retrieved August 11, 2007 His and his crew's actions on July 4, 1961 earned the surviving crewmembers a joint nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in March 2006.Gorbachev Proposes Soviet Sub Crew For Nobel Peace Prize Federation of American Scientists retrieved August 11, 2007 Early life and career Zateyev was born in Nizhny Novgorod. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1943, and studied in the Baku Naval Preparatory School. He passed the navigator course and was commissioned from the M.V. Frunze Higher Naval School in Leningrad. In the late 1940s he joined the Black Sea Fleet and served on submarines first as navigation officer and then rose through the position of Executive Officer. In 1954 he completed the Advanced Special Officers' Course and was given command of his own submarine. For the excellent gunnery performance of his submarine he was rewarded by an early promotion by order of the Defence Minister, Marshal Zhukov. In 1958 he was transferred to the Northern Fleet and was given command of the new submarine K-19 when it was commissioned. K-19 K-19. Photo taken by a circling U.S. Navy helicopter. On July 4, 1961, while K-19 was operating near southern Greenland, water pressure in the starboard nuclear reactor plummeted due to a coolant leak in an area of the reactor very difficult to access. The loss of coolant caused the reactor to begin to overheat, endangering the integrity of the control rods. Zateyev mistakenly believed this could lead to a nuclear explosion. The captain believed that such an explosion would damage a nearby NATO base and could cause a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Mikhail Gorbachev later wrote that \\"An explosion on board the K-19 could have been taken for a military provocation or even an attempt to launch a nuclear strike on the North American coast. An immediate response by the United States and NATO could have triggered off a Third World War.\\" Eight crewmen died in the days that followed July 4, after working in the reactor core. However, a jury- rigged coolant system successfully averted any catastrophe. The K-19 was later towed back to harbor and its reactors were replaced over a period of two years. Following the incident, Zateyev and the crew were instructed to keep silent about the accident, and neither the replacement crew for the K-19 nor the families of those who had died were notified. The victims of radiation poisoning were buried in lead coffins at sea, according to the letter written by Mikhail Gorbachev to the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006. Only in 1990 were the survivors (of which there were 56 by February 1, 2006) permitted to speak. Zatayev was subsequently employed on shore. From 1962 to 1965, he studied at the Naval Academy in Leningrad, and was subsequently employed as a department head at the Leningrad Naval Base and at naval headquarters in Moscow. In 1972, he was head of the navy trials department responsible for acceptance of new ships from the shipyards. He retired in 1986, and after 1990, he was actively involved in Soviet Navy veterans' affairs. He died in 1998 from a disease of the lungs, and is buried in Moscow next to some of his comrades from the K-19. In popular culture The character Captain Alexei Vostrikov played by Harrison Ford in the 2002 film K-19: The Widowmaker is heavily based on Zateyev.

(maiden name Murray) is a fictional character from the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital. She was played by actress Emily McLaughlin, from the show's premiere on April 1, 1963, until McLaughlin's death in 1991. On April 1, 2015, Rebecca Herbst portrayed the character in a flashback for the show's 52nd anniversary.  Casting and Conception  Emily McLaughlin was cast as one of the original leading actresses on the series, previously having played Dr. Ellen Seaton on Young Dr. Malone. Registered nurse Jessie Brewer spoke the opening line of the premiere episode, \\"Seventh floor, nurses station,\\" a phrase that became a staple in the show's early years. The series' original premise centered on the drama of Brewer and Dr. Steve Hardy's personal lives and experiences at General Hospital. When she died on April 26, 1991, the show wrote in the character's off-screen death. Actor and friend John Beradino (Steve Hardy) gave an on-air announcement and moment of silence the week after her death. In 1976, while McLaughlin was on medical leave for internal bleeding, photographer and actress Aneta Corsaut stepped in to play Brewer for a six-week period. Corsaut felt she had big shoes to fill, as she said to the Ocala Star-Banner, \\"I know everyone on the show practically worships her, which made it difficult for me at first.\\" On April 1, 2015, Rebecca Herbst portrayed the character in a flashback for the show's 52nd anniversary. Herbst has portrayed Elizabeth Webber on the show since 1997.  Storylines  Jessie Brewer worked at General Hospital as a nurse for many years, and was close friends with Steve Hardy, the hospital chief of staff and his wife Audrey Hardy. At the show's conception, she was the leading heroine, married to Dr. Phil Brewer, a younger man who caused her much heartache over the years. At one point, Phil raped her which left her pregnant. However, their baby daughter would die, leaving Jessie distraught. Phil would come in and out of Jessie's life for over a decade until he was murdered by nurse Augusta McLeod in 1974. Jessie also briefly dated attorney Lee Baldwin who would defend her when she was accused of murdering her husband Dr. John Prentice who had actually committed suicide after discovering that he was terminally ill. In 1973, Jessie became involved with Teddy Holmes, a con- man who absconded with money Jessie gave him to open a business, running away with her own niece, Carolyn Murray. Jessie's nephew, Ken, was played by a young Mark Hamill. By the mid 1970s with the show focusing on newer characters such as Dr. Lesley Williams and the Webber family, Jessie was made a supporting character, although she remained important to the storyline. She became a mother figure to vivacious nurse Bobbie Spencer who lived with Jessie for many years and tried to encourage Jessie to accept the marriage proposal of Dan Rooney, the long time hospital administrator. For a while, Dan would spend his days with Jessie at her apartment although he continued to sleep at the men's club, trying to prove to Jessie that they were compatible enough to become husband and wife. After a while, Dan tired of the arrangement and began to court Bobbie's aunt Ruby Anderson which made Jessie secretly jealous. When Ruby confronted Jessie over what she perceived as a slight in behavior, Jessie realized that she was acting childish and apologized, although she would on occasion go to concerts and other social events with Dan when Ruby wasn't available. As the 1980s moved on, Jessie's appearances became more scattered, although she was around for various hospital crises such as the attempt by Mikkos Cassadine to freeze Port Charles with an ice machine, several hostage crises, and dealing with difficult patients who needed the calming effect which Jessie excelled at. She would also become a confidante for the nurses under her charge including Diana Taylor and Anne Logan. At times, Jessie would be called upon to discipline her nurses, especially Amy Vining who had a penchant for gossip. However, when Dr. Monica Quartermaine confronted Amy over giving away her private messages to her estranged husband, Alan, Jessie stepped up to defend Amy and insisted that any complaints against the nursing staff be taken up with her. Thanks to Jessie's patience with her, Amy matured gradually although she never fully stopped her gossiping. Jessie was prominently featured in a return guest appearance by Audrey's sister, Lucille March, who came back to visit in 1982. Jessie continued to be seen periodically over the next decade, and in a 1988 episode, confided to Amy that she was reluctant to attend an event on the Port Charles docks due to her fear of heights. Jessie's last appearance was in February 1991, just weeks before Emily McLaughlin's death, being seen as a guest at a wedding. While Jessie's death is never dealt with on-screen until years after, actor John Beradino did pay tribute to her by announcing McLaughlin's death at the conclusion of a show and asking for a moment of silence in her honor. In April 1993, Steve is visited by Angie Costello, one of her former patients, and Steve mentions that Jessie had died some time ago. Jessie is honored in a 2013 anniversary episode along with Amy Vining at the annual nurse's ball.  Reception  Jessie Brewer is regarded as one of the integral aspects of the early years of General Hospital. Gary Warner, author of General Hospital: The Complete Scrapbook, told the Los Angeles Times in 1995: \\"A lot of people don't even know how important a character [Jessie] was. Pivotal for exactly 15 years. From 1963 to the late '70s, Jessie was it. She got me into soaps. I just remember being mesmerized by her eyes, those sad eyes. Anything and everything that could possibly go wrong in her life went wrong.\\"  References  External Reading  *Soapzone History: The Sixties *Soapzone History: The Seventies Category:General Hospital characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1963 Category:Fictional nurses Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Jessie Brewer"},{"id":"12715005","text":"McAndrews, Held & Malloy is a Chicago-based intellectual property law firm in the United States.

It lies on State Highway 114 eighteen miles southeast of Olney in the northeastern part of the county. As of the 2000 Census, the population was estimated to be 300.  History  Loving was founded in 1907 on land that was part of the Lost Valley Loving Ranch, owned by Oliver Loving who was the grandson of the famous cattle drover, Oliver Loving. The town was moved approximately one mile to the north in 1909 in order to be along the Gulf, Texas and Western Railroad. Trinity Townsite Company trustee B.B. Cain platted the new town on land purchased from the Steadham brothers, members of a local ranching family. Loving grew at a slow but steady pace throughout the early and middle part of the twentieth century and by 1930 possessed several churches, businesses as well as its own school, bank, and church. The population peaked at 350 in 1940, but subsequently declined to 240 by 1980 and maintained this level through the 1990 Census. According to the 2000 Census, however, this figure had increased significantly and Loving is now home to some 300 residents.

He trained in both medicine and in law, taking his law degree in Pavia in 1810. He moved to Milan to continue his studies where he became a Freemason and a Carbonaro. He practised law in Brescia and Trento but his clandestine activities came to the attention of the authorities and he fled to the safety of Switzerland in 1816. There he continued his political agitation, largely based in Chur and Yverdon.Fisch (1943) He travelled throughout Europe, maintaining his revolutionary activism,Robson & Robson (1986) before being granted right of asylum in England in 1823. There, he soon established a broad circle of exiled and radical friends including: Ugo Foscolo, Sir John Bowring, Thomas Campbell, Joseph Henry Green and Edward Craven Hawtrey. Though he claims that Bowring had introduced him to write for the Westminster Review, he managed a meagre living on various failed educational enterprises, and publishing on educational matters and tutoring in German. He was imprisoned for debt in 1829 and took the opportunity to learn English medical terminology under the guidance of Green. On his release from prison in 1830, he visited Philippe Buonarroti, an old friend, in Brussels then, after a brief return to England, rushed to France to join in the July Revolution. Returning to England in 1831 he joined the Friends of the People Society and professed to be a Saint- Simonian. He then took up the practice of medicine, contributing a medical column to the radical Penny Satirist from 1837 to 1840, in addition to editing the magazine.

Waldorf ‚Äì a tool and die maker's apprentice who had immigrated to the United States from Germany to study at Columbia University ‚Äì founded a small defense electronics company in College Point, Queens that was initially named Waldorf Controls Corporation but changed its name later that year to Instrument Systems Corporation (ISC). In 1961, ISC issued shares to the public and bolstered its fledgling avionics business by acquiring Telephonics Corporation. Established in December 1933, Telephonics was among a handful of aviation electronics pioneers that formed the nucleus of the aviation and defense industry on Long Island during the mid-20th century. Although highly regarded for its products, ISC struggled financially in its early years. To reposition the company for future growth, ISC's major stakeholders, including Waldorf and director Lester Avnet, the president of Avnet Electronics Corporation and son of its founder Charles Avnet, turned to a highly regarded former executive at Loral Corporation, Edward Garrett.  Edward J. Garrett era (1964‚Äì1982)  Edward Garrett was named chairman and president of ISC in 1964. Following a strategy that had proved successful at Loral, Garrett transformed ISC by closing deficit-ridden plants, seeking civilian markets as well as government research-and-development contracts, and acquiring a wide array of young growth-oriented companies, mainly in defense and commercial electronics and manufacturing. In 1966, Garrett brought in his son-in-law, Harvey Blau, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, as General Counsel to help navigate legal issues and close transactions. ISC purchased 20 companies in 1968 alone, ranking second in acquisitions nationwide that year, as investor appetite for corporate conglomerates reached its peak. That year ISC listed its stock on the American Stock Exchange, which was then home to many fast-growing companies. ISC's subsidiaries operated plants throughout the United States and Canada producing electronic devices, special purpose trucks, hardware tools, batteries, furniture, decorative glassware, plastic packaging, calculators and data processors, and sheet-metal building products, among others. ISC's biggest contracts of the Garrett era exemplified the company's continued ability to leverage innovative technologies it had developed for military or government purposes and apply them to civilian use. For example, after successfully producing communications systems for the U.S. military, Telephonics won multi-year contracts to produce multiplex passenger entertainment systems for the new Boeing 747 and Lockheed L-1011 wide-body airplanes. Garrett's aggressive strategy grew ISC at an astonishing rate, transforming it from a struggling small electronics company to a nationally recognized industrial conglomerate in less than a decade. Net sales increased from $5.7 million in 1964 to $165.2 million in 1970 and total assets from $4.1 million to $120.4 million in the same period. In 1970, ISC was listed for the first time on the prestigious Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. As the 1970s progressed, however, Garrett's strategy faced stiff headwinds. Conglomerates had fallen out of favor with investors, who preferred companies to focus on a single industry, and with the Nixon Administration, which was concerned about mass layoffs after acquisitions. As the Vietnam War winded down, U.S. defense spending also started to decrease. The first and second oil crises as well as the recessions of 1973‚Äì1975 and the early 1980s further diminished ISC's prospects. As a result of these macroeconomic developments and the divestiture of underperforming divisions, ISC's revenues fell from $233.25 million in 1974 to $104.3 million in 1982 ‚Äì the year Garrett died at age 64.  Harvey R. Blau era (1982‚Äì2008)  Following Edward Garrett's death in 1982, Harvey R. Blau was named Chairman of the Board and CEO. Blau moved ISC from \\"the brink of not surviving‚Äù back on a profitable footing by accelerating Garrett's divestiture and cost-cutting plan and selling ISC's window, lighting and metal casting operations. The new leadership also improved the company's finances by raising capital via a rights offering to existing shareholders, boosting shareholder equity from $4.6 million to $33.7 million and reducing long-term debt. ‚ÄúWhat we have left is what we want and it‚Äôs profitable,‚Äù Blau told shareholders in 1983. ISC's subsidiaries also successfully secured new business. Telephonics received orders to develop components for the central integrated test system of Rockwell International's B-1B bomber, communications and radio control systems for Lockheed S-3A aircraft and Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk LAMPS MK III helicopters, and a new advanced audio communications system for NASA's Space Shuttle orbiter spaceplane. In addition to strengthening ISC's existing lines of business, Blau pursued a price-conscious acquisition strategy and reestablished a conglomerate structure by purchasing undervalued growth- oriented companies in unrelated industry sectors in order to diversify ISC's source of revenue and earnings. In 1984, ISC acquired troubled clothing manufacturer Oneita Knitting Mills, Inc., for $14 million. Blau and his team renamed the company Oneita Industries, restructured its finances, and grew it to the country's third-largest maker of specialty T-shirts, tripling sales to $300 million within a few years. ISC took Oneita public in 1988, selling 34 percent of shares for about $9 million, and had divested the remainder of the company by 1993. The purchase of Clopay Corporation in 1986 for $37 million represented ISC's most successful diversification effort under Blau. Founded as a paper wholesaler in 1859, this Cincinnati-based company started to produce window coverings during World War II and subsequently changed its name to Clopay, a portmanteau of \\"cloth and paper.\\" Clopay entered the plastic film and garage door business in 1952 and 1966, respectively. It was these two divisions that would become key elements of ISC's growth in the 1990s and 2000s. By building long-term relationships with key strategic business partners, ISC built Clopay into the leading manufacturer of residential garage doors in the United States and one of the leading suppliers of plastic films for diapers, surgical gowns, and drapes. In 1991, Clopay accounted for 70 percent of ISC's $50 million operating income. Although Blau had transformed ISC into a streamlined holding company with three thriving core businesses ‚Äì plastics, garage doors, and electronics ‚Äì within a decade, Wall Street hadn't noticed. \\"We're very frustrated that we haven't gotten our story across,\\" Blau stated at the time. To raise ISC's profile, Blau moved the company's stock from the American Stock Exchange to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange in 1994 and changed its name to Griffon Corporation after the mythical half-lion, half-eagle that represented strength through diversity and was known for guarding valuable treasure. Griffon continued its strong growth from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s. Sales surpassed the $1 billion mark in 1999 and $1.5 billion mark in 2006. Clopay Plastics formed a joint venture named Finotech with German-based Corovin GmbH to manufacture specialty plastic films and laminates in Europe in 1996, taking a 60 percent stake in the new company. Finotech provided Clopay Plastics with a platform for further international expansion. Clopay purchased Bohme Verpackungsfolien GmbH & Co., a German manufacturer of plastic packaging and specialty films in 1998 and a 60 percent stake in Isofilme Ltda, a Brazilian manufacturer of plastic hygienic and specialty films, in 2002. Three years later, Clopay acquired full ownership in Finotech and Isofilme. Telephonics won its first contract for more than $100 million in 1997. It received $114 million from the British Royal Air Force to supply communications equipment to upgrade Nimrod anti- submarine airplanes. However, Telephonics reduced its overall dependence on military contracts and expanded its commercial and nondefense government business. Among others, it won a $26 million contract to supply wireless communications equipment for 1,080 New York City Subway cars in 1997. Griffon's garage door subsidiary expanded in step with the residential housing boom in the United States. It added a home installation service for residential building products such as garage doors, manufactured fireplaces, floor coverings, and cabinetry. In 1997, Griffon purchased Holmes-Hally Industries for about $35 million. Holmes-Hally was a West Coast manufacturer and installer of residential garage doors and related hardware with $80 million in annual sales. By 2006, the installation services subsidiary served 17 percent of all new residential housing in the United States. The bursting of the U.S. housing bubble in 2007 and subsequent collapse of the subprime mortgage industry and global financial crisis affected the garage door and installation services subsidiaries severely and depressed Griffon's overall financial results. Net sales of the garage doors subsidiary declined by 13 percent in 2007 and 10.5 percent in 2008 with operating profits decreasing from $41 million in 2006 to $7 million in 2007 to -$17 million in 2008. Net sales of the installation services subsidiary shrunk from $309 million in 2006 to $251 million in 2007 to $109 million in 2008, forcing Griffon to discontinue the installation services business in 2008. Griffon's overall net income shrunk from $52 million to $22 million to -$41 million in the same time period. Griffon also came under pressure from shareholders during this crisis. In 2007, the hedge fund Clinton Group, which was Griffon's second-largest shareholder at 8.5 percent, urged the company to boost its share price by purchasing 50 percent of the shares outstanding and also demanded the right to appoint the majority of Griffon directors. In response, Blau hired Goldman Sachs to evaluate strategic alternatives for the company.  Ronald J. Kramer era (2008‚Äìpresent)  As Harvey Blau approached his 25th anniversary as Griffon CEO, he concluded that it was time for new leadership to lead the company through the Great Recession and return it to a growth trajectory. Just as Blau had succeeded his father-in-law Edward Garrett in 1982, he was succeeded by his son-in-law Ron Kramer on April 1, 2008. Blau continued as non-executive Chairman of the Board. An investment banker who had married Blau's daughter Stephanie in 1992, Kramer had served on the company's board of directors since 1993 and was elected Vice Chairman in 2003. To improve Griffon's balance sheet, Kramer secured a new $100 million revolving line of credit from JPMorgan Chase, exited the residential installation services business, which had experienced a 65-percent decline in net sales over 3 years (see above), refinanced Griffon's senior debt, and raised about $250 million from a stock offering and investments by Goldman Sachs, Kramer, and existing Griffon shareholders. Griffon's recapitalization eliminated the need to meet near-term debt obligations and built a cash cushion for future acquisitions. Having rebuilt Griffon's equity base, Kramer began to reconfigure the company for future growth. Concerned about reductions in U.S. defense spending with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan winding down, Griffon reduced Telephonics' staff from 1,400 in 2010 to 1,100 in 2012, restructured its facilities and organizational structure, and focused on expanding its presence in the growing homeland security, air traffic management, and unmanned aerial vehicle (‚Äúdrone‚Äù) markets, both domestically and internationally. In 2012, Telephonics formed a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra to produce radar and surveillance systems for the Indian Ministry of Defense and the civilian sector near Delhi, India. This joint venture together with civilian contracts, such as a $23 million award from the Federal Aviation Administration in 2014 to upgrade airport surveillance radar, positioned Telephonics for further growth. To diversify revenue stream in the home and building products division, Griffon purchased Ames True Temper for $542 million in 2010. Founded in 1774, Ames was a leading global manufacturer of non-powered landscaping tools. Kramer strengthened the new subsidiary through further acquisitions, which were integrated into Ames (renamed The AMES Companies). In 2011, Griffon acquired the Southern Patio pots and planters business from Southern Sales & Marketing Group for $23 million. To complement the Southern Patio brand, Griffon purchased Northcote Pottery, an Australian maker of garden decor products founded in 1897, for $22 million in late 2013. A few months later, Griffon acquired Cyclone, the Australian garden and tools division of Illinois Tool Works, for $40 million. While pursuing its long-term strategy of \\"strength through diversity,\\" Griffon also sought to enhance leadership support to its subsidiaries. Griffon added further depth to senior management to better guide strategic decision-making, assist with acquisition and growth opportunities, and allocate resources more effectively. In 2009, Griffon hired Brian Harris from Dover Corporation as chief accounting officer, promoting him to vice president and controller in 2012 and senior vice president and CFO in 2015. In 2012, the company named Robert Mehmel President and COO. Mehmel joined Griffon from DRS Technologies, a manufacturer of defense electronic products, systems, and military support services, which grew from $400 million to over $4 billion in sales during his tenure. In 2008, DRS was acquired by Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica for $5.2 billion which, at that time, was the largest single acquisition of a U.S. defense company by a foreign firm. Kramer was appointed Chairman of the Board in 2018, succeeding Harvey Blau after his death in January 2018. Confident in the long-term prospects of its subsidiaries and believing that company stock had been undervalued, Griffon's management has used the company's cash to gradually repurchase Griffon shares. Between August 2011 and March 2018, Griffon repurchased 21.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $290 million. As of March 2018, there was additional repurchase authorization remaining of $21 million.  Portfolio reorganization  Starting in 2017, Griffon executed a series of transactions to increase shareholder value, and to reshape the company's portfolio with the objectives of better focusing and strengthening its core businesses. In October 2017, Griffon acquired the ClosetMaid home storage and organization business from Emerson (NYSE:EMR) for an effective purchase price of $165 million. ClosetMaid is expected to add $300 million of sales to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment. Griffon announced the combination of ClosetMaid with The AMES Companies in March 2018, with the expectation of unlocking additional value given the complementary customers, warehousing and distribution, manufacturing, and sourcing capabilities of the two businesses. In November 2017, Griffon announced the sale of its Clopay Plastics business to Berry Global (NYSE:BERY) for $475 million. This transaction, which closed in February 2018, marked Griffon's exit from the specialty plastics industry that the company entered when it acquired Clopay in 1986. This divestiture provided immediate liquidity to Griffon, and is also expected to be a contributor to improving the company's future free cash flow conversion given the elevated capital needs of the Clopay Plastics operations as compared to Griffon's other subsidiaries. Griffon bolstered its Clopay Building Products subsidiary with the acquisition of CornellCookson, a leading provider of rolling steel service doors, fire doors, and grilles, for an effective purchase price of $170 million. This transaction, completed in June 2018, rounds out the Clopay Building Products portfolio with a line of commercial rolling steel products to complement the existing Clopay sectional door offerings in the commercial industry. CornellCookson is expected to contribute approximately $200 million in annual sales to Griffon's Home and Building Products Segment. During this time, Griffon also closed a number of acquisitions to strengthen The AMES Companies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, Griffon acquired La Hacienda, an outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden d√©cor products, and KelKay, a manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping, in April 2017 and February 2018, respectively. These two businesses provided AMES with a platform for growth in the UK market are expected to help with building channels to leading garden centers, retailers, and grocers in the UK and Ireland. In Australia, Griffon started 2017 announcing it had acquired Hills Home Living, the iconic brand of clotheslines and home products, from Hills Limited (ASX:HIL). Later, in September 2017, Griffon acquired Tuscan Path, a provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden d√©cor products. In the United States, Griffon acquired Harper Brush Works, a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use, from Horizon Global (NYSE:HZN) in October 2017 to expand the AMES line of long-handle tools to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning products. Operating segments and subsidiaries Griffon today conducts its operations through five wholly owned subsidiaries in two reportable segments. Griffon has a particular focus on well-known businesses with a long legacy and strong brand recognition. The company places emphasis on domestic manufacturing, domestic product content, and having business operations in-country when practical.  Home and Building Products Segment  Griffon's Home and Building Products segment includes The AMES Companies, ClosetMaid, Clopay Building Products, and CornellCookson. = Clopay Building Products = Clopay Building Products (CBP) is the largest manufacturer and marketer of residential garage doors in North America and one of the largest manufacturers of industrial and commercial doors for the new construction, and repair, and remodel markets. CBP operates through a national network of over 50 distribution centers across North America, and sells to approximately 2,000 independent professional installing dealers as well as to major home center retail chains. CBP's self- installment customers are Home Depot and Menards. CBP's family of brands includes Clopay, America's Favorite Garage Doors, Holmes Garage Door Company, and IDEAL Door. CBP traces its operations to the purchase of garage door maker Baker-Aldor-Jones by Clopay Corporation in 1964, and the acquisition of Holmes-Hally Industries in 1997. Today, Clopay continues to manufacture its products in the United States, with headquarters and principal manufacturing sites in Ohio. = CornellCookson = CornellCookson is one of the largest North American manufacturers of rolling steel service doors, fire doors, counter doors and fire shutters, and security grilles. These products are designed for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail applications. CornellCookson sells to a network of approximately 700 independent professional installing dealers as well as directly to national accounts. CornellCookson traces its roots back to 1828, when founder George Cornell took over the blacksmith shop where he worked in Manhattan and formed Cornell Iron Works. Cornell was a major provider of cast iron products until the early 1900s, when the company began focusing exclusively on rolling steel door products. In 2008, Cornell Iron Works acquired the Cookson Door Company, another manufacturer of rolling steel door systems that was founded by the Cookson family in 1938. CornellCookson still manufactures its products in the United States, with principal manufacturing sites in Pennsylvania and Arizona. = The AMES Companies = Acquired by Griffon for $542 million in 2010, the AMES Companies (\\"Ames\\") are a leading global provider of non-powered lawn and garden tools and accessories, including include long handle tools, wheelbarrows, planters, snow tools, striking tools, pruning tools, garden hoses, and clotheslines. AMES is one of the oldest companies in the United States in continuous operation, founded when Captain John Ames started his blacksmith shop making America's finest metal shovels in 1774. AMES continues to be a manufacturer of hand and long-handle tools to this day. Many of the other AMES businesses and brands, including True Temper, Garant, and Union Tool, can trace their histories back directly or through predecessor companies to the 1800s.. The largest customers of AMES are Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, Costco, and Bunnings Warehouse. AMES tool brands include AMES, True Temper, Union Tools, Garant, Cyclone, Kelso, Razor-Back, Jackson, Trojan, Trojan Cyclone, Supercraft, and Westmix.

It was the only clearly defined major glacier in the Irish Sea and flowed about 700 km from its source areas to its southernmost margin. It is sometimes referred to as an ‚Äúice stream‚Äù since it appears to have been constrained not by ice-free land areas but by highlands which were themselves buried beneath ice. At the time of its maximum extent the glacier extended all the way to the coasts of Somerset and Cornwall, along the south coast of Ireland, and even reached the Isles of Scilly. It was forced through a relatively narrow constriction in St George's Channel by ice flowing from the Irish Ice Cap (to the west) and the Welsh Ice Cap (to the east). At one point the glacier was probably no more than 80 km wide. Once through this constriction, in the Anglian Glaciation, the ice spread out into a great lobe, in the area now occupied by the Celtic Sea and the approaches to the Bristol Channel. On the eastern flank of the glacier, the evidence of striations, glacial deposits and \\"erratic trains\\" shows that the edge of the Irish Sea Glacier was pushed southwards by ice coming from the Welsh ice cap on the Brecon Beacons, so that Irish Sea ice flowed parallel with the coast of South Wales and then came into contact with the English coast around the Somerset Levels, between Exmoor and the Mendips. It is not known how far inland this ice extended, but there are scattered glacial deposits in the Bridgwater - Glastonbury district‚Äîthese may mark the easternmost extent of the glacier. On its western flank the Irish Sea Glacier reached Cork Harbour. The maximum width of this great ice lobe was more than 320 km. \\"Old\\" glacial deposits in South wales and in Pembrokeshire are still not accurately dated. 300px Currently there is a great debate about the dating of the Devensian glaciation of the Isles of Scilly. The ice of the Irish Sea Glacier certainly pressed against the northern coasts of the islands, and accumulating evidence seems to show that this occurred some time after 24,000 years ago.Smedley, R.K. et al (2017) New age constraints for the limit of the British‚ÄìIrish Ice Sheet on the Isles of Scilly. Journal of Quaternary Science 32(1), pp 48‚Äì62. During this same glacial episode the ice of the Irish Sea Glacier also swept along the southern Irish coast as far west as Cork, and reached its outer limit about 100 km to the SW of the Isles of Scilly. Research suggests that the ice was grounded everywhere and not floating; this is consistent with the view that sea-level at the LGM was around 120m lower than it is today. Even further out in the southwest approaches, the ice edge was floating and calving. One current theory is that the glacier moved to its outermost position by a \\"lobate surge partially propagated by high porewater pressures within deformable marine substrate\\", leaving parts of South Wales, the Bristol Channel and the coasts of SW England free of glacier ice. However, glaciers have to behave according to the laws of ice physics, and a long narrow lobate surge with a flat long profile would be difficult to explain. Tightly confined \\"valley glaciers\\" do not exist on open tundra situations (such as this must have been at the time) especially if the glacier bed rises southwards. Glacier ice in those circumstances must have \\"backed up\\" and spread sideways. It is most likely that when the Irish Sea Glacier reached its southernmost extent, the glacier surface must have been at c 2,000m in St George‚Äôs Channel, c 2,250m over the Isle of Anglesey, and c 2,500m over the Isle of Man. It follows that the mountains of Wales and Eastern Ireland must also have been submerged beneath thick glacier ice at the time. Furthermore, the Bristol Channel is most likely to have been ice-filled at the LGM, as indicated on the adjoining map. Recent work suggests that the area outside the South Ireland End Moraine was inundated by Irish Ice during and after the LGM. At the same time parts of the area outside the South Wales End Moraine must also have been inundated by ice. Another puzzle is the extent to which the long profile of the Irish Sea Glacier, at the time of its maximum extent, approximated to the classic equilibrium profile. Work in analogous situations in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, suggests that the ice surface altitude over the mountains might have been around 800m lower than predicted.

The last master student of Hanns Eisler, he composed music in many genres, including works for the stage. Katzer was one of the pioneers of electronic new music in the German Democratic Republic and the founder of the first electronic-music studio in the GDR. He held leading positions in music organisations, first in the East (Akademie der K√ºnste der DDR), then in the united Germany (Academy of Arts, Berlin, and Deutscher Musikrat), and received many awards, including the Art Prize of the German Democratic Republic, the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic, the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the German Music Authors' Prize.  Biography  Katzer was born in Habelschwerdt, Lower Silesia (now Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka, Poland), on 10 January 1935. From 1954 to 1960 he studied piano, music theory, and composition with (amongst others) Rudolf Wagner-R√©geny and Ruth Zechlin at the Hanns Eisler Hochschule f√ºr Musik in East Berlin, then from 1957 to 1958 he studied in Prague with Karel Jan√°ƒçek. From 1961 to 1963 he was a postgraduate student of Hanns Eisler and Leo Spies at the German Academy of the Arts in Berlin, the last master student of Eisler. In 1963, he became a freelance composer and musician. From 1976 to 1977 he worked in electronic- music studios in Bratislava and Paris. In 1978 Katzer was elected to membership in the Academy of the Arts in East Berlin. In 1980 he was appointed a professor and subsequently taught a masterclass in composition at the Academy of the Arts until 1991. In 1986 he founded the Studio for Experimental Music, affiliated with the Music Department of the Academy of the Arts, and was its artistic director. Katzer was a member of the Academy of Arts in East Berlin until 1993, and then a member of the Berlin section of music until his death. He served as vice president of the music section from 1994 to 2003. From 1989 to 1991, he was president of the German Section of the C.I.M.E. (International Council for Electroacoustical Music). From 1990 to 2001, he was a presiding member of the Deutscher Musikrat (German Music Council, a member of the International Music Council). Katzer lived in Zeuthen near Berlin until his death on 7 May 2019; he was 84 years old.  Compositions  Katzer's earlier works owe a great deal to the music of B√©la Bart√≥k, Igor Stravinsky, and his teacher, Hanns Eisler. In the late 1960s he came under the influence of Witold Lutos≈Çawski and Bernd Alois Zimmermann, departing from conventional tonality and forms. From this point on, his vocabulary included serial, aleatory, and collage techniques, as well as electronic sounds. His compositions included works for chamber ensembles, orchestral works, solo concertos, operas, ballets, puppet plays, and oratorios. His work also encompassed electroacoustical pieces, music for radio dramas, multimedia projects, and projects involving improvised music. His compositions are held by the Saxon State and University Library Dresden, including: * String Quartet No. 1 (1965) * ' (1972) * Die Igeltreppe for narrator and 13 instruments, text by Sarah Kirsch (1973) * Das Land Bum-Bum, opera (1973) * ' (Music machine in D major), for orchestra (1973) * Schwarze V√∂gel, ballet (1975) * Szene f√ºr Kammerensemble, instrumental theatre (1975) * Bevor Ariadne kommt, for electronic sounds (1976) * Concerto for Harpsichord and Wind Quintet (1978) * Ein neuer Sommernachtstraum, ballet (1979) * Aide-memoire, for electronic sounds (1983) * Gastmahl oder √ºber die Liebe, opera, libretto by Gerhard M√ºller (1987) * Antigone oder die Stadt, opera, libretto by Gerhard M√ºller (1989) * Mein 1989, radio composition (1990) * Ich bin ein anderer, H√∂rspiel after Arthur Rimbaud (1990) * L'homme machine, multimedia scenic action (2000) * Medea in Korinth, oratorical scenes, libretto by Christa Wolf (after ').

After the liquidation of the Lenin ghetto in the Pinsk region (now in Belarus) and the murder of its inhabitants on August 14, 1942, about 30 Jews remained alive in Lenin, as they continued to work directly for the Germans as tailors, shoemakers, builders, and photographers. At this time Lubov Rabinovich was ordered to train a group of Belorussian apprentices to take over his trade within one month. A German garrison of 100 people and 30 local policemen was based in Lenin to protect the town. The Soviet \\"Kalinin\\" partisan unit planned an attack on the garrison, assisted by two neighboring units (in total about 150 people). The Jewish fighter Boris Ginsburg was the liaison between the partisan units. On September 12, 1942, the German garrison was suddenly attacked and the partisans inflicted heavy losses, apparently killing 3 German officers (including commandant Grossman), 14 soldiers and 13 policemen. The ghetto quarter was burned down. The remaining Jews fled to the woods with the partisans. Among them were the shoemaker \\"Leizer der Shuster\\" and his wife and daughter; the tailor Mordechai Kravetz; Fanya Lazebnik; the Slutzky family; and the Rabinovich family. In the unit named \\"Kotovsky,\\" within the Pinsk Soviet partisan formations, some of the escapees worked as tailors. Fanya Lazebnik joined the Molotov partisan unit and after recovering her camera during a second raid on Lenin also documented her life in the partisans. Fanya Lazebnik migrated to Canada after the war and also published a memoir of her experiences.

They have frequently been proposed for use in space applications to provide a greater volume of living space for a given mass. The first formal design and manufacture of an inflatable space habitat was in 1961 with a space station design produced by Goodyear (although this design was never flown). A proposal released in 1989 by Johnson Space Center's Man Systems Division outlined a diameter spherical habitat lunar outpost which was partially buried in the lunar surface. An inflatable module called TransHab (a portmanteau of Trans Habitation) was proposed for the International Space Station, and later the private company Bigelow Aerospace revived the design for use in a number of potential civil and commercial applications.Holidays in space are on the horizon, New Scientist article (September 4, 2004), BBC article (July 23, 2010) Construction The construction of an inflatable space habitat is determined by its design objectives. However common elements include interwoven layers of highly durable materials such as Kevlar and mylar around a flexible air bladder which is used to retain an atmosphere. The shape of the module is maintained by the pressure difference between the internal atmosphere and the outside vacuum. The inflatable Bigelow Aerospace modules have an internal core which provides structural support during its launch into orbit. An artist's rendering of the TransHab inflatable module berthed to the ISS. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), attached to the ISS, being inflated on May 28, 2016  Ongoing research  Currently the main areas of research are being undertaken by Bigelow Aerospace and NASA. NASA is currently studying inflatable lunar bases with the planetary surface habitat and airlock unit which is in an early prototype phase, and has conceptual proposals for utilizing expandable- technology space structures in cislunar and interplanetary crewed exploration spacecraft. Bigelow Expandable Activity Module The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) is an experimental expandable space station module developed by Bigelow Aerospace, under contract to NASA, for testing as a temporary module on the International Space Station (ISS) from 2016 to at least 2020. It arrived at the ISS on April 10, 2016, was berthed to the station on April 16, and was expanded and pressurized on May 28, 2016. Bigelow Commercial Space Station The Bigelow Next-Generation Commercial Space Station, composed of two types of expandable space habitat modules, was announced in mid-2010. Bigelow Aerospace ‚Äî Next-Generation Commercial Space Stations: Orbital Complex Construction , Bigelow Aerospace, accessed 2010-07-15. The initial build-out of the station was announced for 2014/2015, and would have consisted of two Sundancer modules and one B330 module.

NASA Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle In early 2011, NASA put forward a conceptual proposal for a long-duration crewed space transport vehicle which includes an artificial gravity space habitat intended to promote crew-health for a crew of up to six persons on missions of up to two years duration. Called the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV), the partial-G torus-ring centrifuge would utilize both standard metal-frame and inflatable spacecraft structures and would provide 0.11 to 0.69 G ().NAUTILUS - X: Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle , Mark L. Holderman, Future in Space Operations (FISO) Colloquium, 2011-01-26, accessed 2011-01-31. NASA NAUTILUS-X: multi-mission exploration vehicle includes centrifuge, which would be tested at ISS , RLV and Space Transport News, 2011-01-28, accessed 2011-01-31. Related to MMSEV is the ISS Centrifuge Demo, proposed in 2011 as a demonstration project preparatory to the final design of the larger torus centrifuge space habitat for the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle. The structure would have an outside diameter of with a ring interior cross-section diameter and would provide 0.08 to 0.51 G (). This test and evaluation centrifuge would have the capability to become a sleep module for ISS crew.  Advantages  * All other factors being equal, the aerodynamic load any vehicle is subjected to as it travels through an atmosphere increases with the square of its diameter. Therefore, a launch vehicle's diameter must be kept to a minimum to ensure a reasonably safe and fuel-efficient ascent through the lower atmosphere. In contrast, a vehicle designed to travel in a vacuum can be engineered without regard for aerodynamics. Because the diameter of the habitat is not strictly constrained by the diameter of the launch (and, if desired, re-entry) vehicle(s), inflatables can have a greater volume of living space for a given mass. * Some designs offer higher resistance to space debris. For example, the B330 provides ballistic protection superior to traditional aluminum shell designs. Bigelow Aerospace ‚Äî Next-Generation Commercial Space Stations: BA 330 , Bigelow Aerospace, 2010, accessed 11 Jan 2011. * Some designs provide higher levels of shielding against radiation. For example, the B330 provides radiation protection equivalent to or better than the International Space Station, \\"and substantially reduces the dangerous impact of secondary radiation.\\"  Flight experience  As of 2019, the only designs that have flown in space have been the Genesis I, Genesis II, and Bigelow Expandable Activity Module from Bigelow Aerospace.

The genus Arius is distributed in brackish and fresh waters of Eastern Africa and south to Southeast Asia. Defining the limits so that Arius can form a natural grouping has always been a problem. The genus was never properly defined, and many species previously classified in Arius are now in other genera. Recent authors have recognized this genus as nonmonophyetic, rejecting that the genus is a natural grouping. Two unnamed groups are distinguished by accessory tooth plates, which are either very elongated and bearing molar-like teeth, or are oval shaped or subtriangular and bearing acicular (needle-like) or conic teeth. A. jatius lacks these tooth plates, but has been included in this genus based on its adipose fin and lateral line. The recognition of Arenarius as a junior synonym of Arius is tentative and needs to be further investigated. Arius species have three pairs of barbels, including the fleshy and cylindrical maxillary barbels and two pairs of mental barbels. The base of the adipose fin is moderately long, about half the length of the base of the anal fin.  Species  Currently, 25 living species are recognized for this genus. * Arius acutirostris F.

He was narrowly beaten by Forty Niner in both the Haskell Invitational Stakes and the Travers Stakes, then also finished second again to Alysheba in the 1988 Breeder's Cup Classic, all with jockey Pat Day aboard coming with late runs and fast finishes for the runner-up placings. He was also second in both the Gotham Stakes and Wood Memorial Stakes to Private Terms earlier in the year. Seeking The Gold ran twice as an older horse, winning an allowance at Belmont Park in May 1989, and finishing second nine days later in the Metropolitan Handicap behind Proper Reality.

The choir and the church soon parted ways due to the church's concerns about the choir's ethnic and religious makeup.Robert Shaw, unpublished video interview, March 22, 1991. The group was led by Abraham Kaplan in the 1960s, and by conductor Richard Westenburg from 1973 to 1979, and by music director and conductor Robert Bass between 1979 and 2008. Among the many accomplishments achieved by the choir during the Bass years were several noteworthy performances at Carnegie Hall, including the New York premiere of Richard Strauss's Friedenstag with the Orchestra of St. Luke's in 1997, the United States premiere of Dvo≈ô√°k's Dimitrij, and the American premiere of Handel's Giove in Argo. Other notable works Bass presented to New York audiences with the Collegiate Chorale included Respighi's La fiamma and Puccini's Turandot with the new ending by Luciano Berio. Bass also recorded and performed two of Beethoven's cantatas, Der Glorreiche Augenblick and Auf die Erhebung Leopold des Zwieten zur Kaiserw√ºrde with sopranos Deborah Voigt and Elizabeth Futral. Many other notable singers performed with the choir during the Bass years, including Kathleen Battle, Stephanie Blythe, Vinson Cole, David Daniels, Lauren Flanigan, Maria Guleghina, Hei-Kyung Hong, Salvatore Licitra, Alessandra Marc, and Bryn Terfel.

Beckelman (1906‚Äì1955) was a social worker from New York City. He began his career with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC or Joint) in 1939, becoming its director-general in 1951. Born in New York, Beckelman graduated from the College of the City of New York in 1928. He further took graduate classes at Columbia University, the School for Jewish Social Work and the New York School of Social Work. He joined JDC in 1939 and was sent to Vilna in October 1939, where he faced a refugee crisis in the aftermath of the Invasion of Poland. With his colleague Yitzhak Gitterman, Beckelman arranged to feed, house, and clothe thousands of people, as well as provide care for children and the elderly, sponsor cultural activities, and offer vocational training. At the end of 1939, Beckelman and Gitterman set out for Stockholm on an Estonian passenger ship. Beckelman planned to send uncensored reports to the home office in New York and then return to Vilna; Gitterman hoped to flee Europe. The Germans seized the ship, and both men were arrested. Gitterman was sent back to Poland, where he continued to work for the JDC and perished during a Warsaw ghetto action in January 1943. Beckelman was able to return to Lithuania and continued to support the refugees. He left Lithuania in February 1941 and was posted to South America in 1941‚Äì42. He then joined the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, State Department's Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations, and UNRRA. In February 1945, he became assistant to Herbert William Emerson, director of the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees. He re-joined JDC in 1946 as second-in-command of the European programs and was elected as director-general of JDC in 1951.

(detail of plaque) By the Sleepy Lagoon is a light- orchestral valse serenade by British composer Eric Coates, written in 1930. In 1940 American songwriter Jack Lawrence added lyrics with Coates' approval; the resulting song, \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\", became a popular-music standard of the 1940s.The Story Behind The Song , jacklawrencesongwriter.com, Retrieved 14 November 2010. Orchestral serenade: By the Sleepy Lagoon British composer Eric Coates was inspired to compose By the Sleepy Lagoon in 1930 while overlooking a beach in West Sussex. His son, Austin Coates, later remembered: > It was inspired in a very curious way and not by what you might expect. It > was inspired by the view on a warm, still summer evening looking across the > \\"lagoon\\" from the east beach at Selsey towards Bognor Regis. It's a pebble > beach leading steeply down, and the sea at that time is an incredibly deep > blue of the Pacific. It was that impression, looking across at Bognor, which > looked pink‚Äîalmost like an enchanted city with the blue of the Downs behind > it‚Äîthat gave him the idea for the Sleepy Lagoon. He didn't write it there; > he scribbled it down, as he used to, at extreme speed, and then simply took > it back with him to London where he wrote and orchestrated it.\\"Eric Coates > in Sussex\\", Transcript of The Enchanted Garden, BBC local radio programme, > devised, scripted and produced by Ian Lace. Available on MusicWeb; retrieved > 14 November 2010. The piece is a slow waltz for full orchestra that lasts roughly four minutes. Michael Jameson observed that the piece is \\"elegantly orchestrated\\" with \\"a shapely theme for violins presented in the salon-esque genre entirely characteristic of British light music in the 1920s and '30s\\".\\"By the Sleepy Lagoon, valse serenade for orchestra\\", Classical Work Reviews, All Media Guide, 2010. Song: \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\" Bandleader Harry James in 1943. James released a hit version of \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\" in April 1942, which reached No. 1 in the Billboard charts. In early 1940, American songwriter Jack Lawrence came across the piano solo version of By the Sleepy Lagoon and wrote a song lyric, then took it to Chappell, the publisher of Coates's original melody. The head of Chappell's New York office, Max Dreyfus, was concerned that this lyric had been added without consulting the composer. Dreyfus warned Lawrence that Coates \\"may resent your tampering with his melody\\". Dreyfus also didn't think the melody belonged in the popular genre and that it was better suited to its original treatment as a piece of light classical music. Later that year, Lawrence attempted to contact Coates in person. Britain was in the middle of World War II, and, contrary to Dreyfus' fears, Coates thought the lyrics fit so well that he retorted he could hardly believe it had been written to a pre- existing melody: \\"You have set the words to my music so cleverly that one would never suspect that the music had been written first!\\" The song, \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\", was published as a Lawrence-Coates collaboration in 1940. Lawrence showed the song to bandleader Harry James, whose recording of it was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 36549. It first reached the Billboard Best Seller chart on 17 April 1942 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 1. Other hit versions were recorded by Dinah Shore, David Rose, Fred Waring, Glenn Miller and others. A recording with Tom Jenkins and his Palm Court Orchestra was made in London on 15 March 1949. It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalogue number B 9768\\\\. Peter Kreuder recorded the tune in 1949. The song made the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960, in a version by the Platters, found originally on the flipside of the 1960 top ten \\"Harbor Lights\\".  In popular culture By the Sleepy Lagoon has been the theme music to BBC Radio 4's long-running series Desert Island Discs since its inception in 1942.Lace, Ian. Foreword to Eric Coates's autobiography Suite in Four Movements, Thames Publishing, 1986. At the height of the Coates-Lawrence song's popularity in 1942, a minor reservoir near Los Angeles was christened the \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\" by local youths.Sleepy Lagoon (California) website After the media's extensive use of the song title when reporting on the Sleepy Lagoon Murder in that same year, the name became permanent‚Äîalthough the reservoir itself has since disappeared. In 1977, \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\" made a notable appearance in the famous Oscar-winning motion picture Annie Hall directed by Woody Allen. Coates' musical piece has been used since 1952 for one of the first fairytales in the Dutch theme park Efteling, called The Magic Clock. In 2012 it also became the main musical theme of the water fountain spectacle Aquanura at the park. The fountain show is the largest of its kind in Europe. As the show is performed nightly on a large lake, the creators used By the Sleepy Lagoon as an introduction and linking melody throughout the show. The musical piece was partly rearranged and rerecorded by the Dutch Brabant Orchestra especially for the show.

Without a dollar in his pocket, Russell E. Gardner left his home state of Tennessee for St. Louis in 1879. Three-and-a- half decades later he was a multi-millionaire. Gardner had made it big in St. Louis by manufacturing Banner buggies before the turn of the century, and unlike many wagon builders, was well aware of what the automobile age meant to his business. He got started by building new Chevrolet bodies and alongside, his company was building wagons. By 1915 this had led to the complete assembly of Chevrolets in St. Louis and Russell Gardner controlled all Chevrolet trade west of the Mississippi River. Gardner sold his Chevrolet business to General Motors after his three sons entered the Navy during World War I. After the war, his sons decided to build their own automobiles. The Gardner Motor Company was established with Russell E. Gardner, Sr. as chairman of the board, Russell E. Gardner, Jr. as president, and Fred Gardner as vice-president. Their previous experience had been in the assembling of cars, so it was not surprising that the Gardner was assembled from bought-in parts. Lycoming engines were used throughout the years of production. A four-cylinder model with a wheelbase and medium price was introduced in late 1919 as a 1920 model. Sales in 1921 were 3800 cars, which increased in 1922 to 9000. In early 1924 Cannon Ball Baker established a new mid-winter transcontinental record from New York to Los Angeles in 4 days, 17 hours, and 8 minutes in a Gardner. They started to prepare to expand the product line and distributorship network. The plant's capacity was 40,000 cars annually, and by 1925 these included both sixes and eights. The fours were dropped in 1925, with both sixes and eights being produced in 1926 and 1927. For 1927 and 1929 the eights were the only engines used. The interior of the Series 90 cars had many high-quality materials, such as silver-finished hardware, silk window curtains, walnut wood pieces and mohair upholstery (Series 75 and 80 did not have walnut in the interior.) All cars had a fuel and temperature gauge standard. During the summer of 1929, Gardner announced two \\"very important\\" automobile contracts. The first was with Sears, Roebuck and Company, who wanted Gardner to develop a new car to be sold by mail order. The other was with New Era Motors, to manufacture the front-wheel-drive Ruxton. With the stock market crash in late 1929, both deals were off. For the 1930 model Gardners, they returned to the six-cylinder engine only. In January 1930 the company announced a front-wheel- drive six-cylinder car, An six on a wheelbase with a Baker-Raulang body which sported a longer hood and with distinctive low-slung lines. Rare in America, they used Lockheed hydraulic internal-expanding brakes and two-way hydraulic shock absorbers. Unfortunately, it turned out that they would only produce prototypes of this model. The 1931 models were the same as the 1930 model, just mildly updated. In mid-1931, Russell E. Gardner, Jr. solicited the permission of his stockholders to stop producing automobiles. The reasons he gave for his company's failure were that Gardner had been unprofitable after 1927 due to fierce competition from the major producers of automobiles and their control of many sources of parts supply. The Gardner funeral car was built through 1932, but then the company ended all production. http://www.gardnermotorcars.com ReferencesExternal links *Gardner Motor Car Company Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of the United States Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1920 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1931 Category:1920 establishments in Missouri Category:1931 disestablishments in Missouri ","title":"Gardner (automobile)"},{"id":"12715585","text":"Robert Franciscus Eenhoorn OON (born February 9, 1968) is a retired Dutch professional baseball player and manager.

It was the first of Rosa's stories to feature the Beagle Boys. Like some other comic stories by Don Rosa (such as A Matter of Some Gravity and The Universal Solvent) this story is founded in toying with the physical laws. Rosa says that he got the ideas for these comics from the mechanical engineering courses he took before he became a professional cartoonist. Plot To make robbing the Money Bin easier, the Beagle Boys acquire anti-inertia and neutra-friction beam pistols from the foolish cabbage professor (The one who invented the petrifying beam in The Mysterious Stone Ray). Next, they march to the Money Bin while evading all obstacles using the beam pistols, including a barbed-wire fence, dogs, portcullis, automatically triggered machine gun nests, and cannonballs. They advance in that way as far as towards the strongroom. There, Scrooge snatches the neutra-friction pistol and fires it at his money, making it behave essentially as a liquid. The Beagle Boys are disappointed when they discover that the money masses are too slippery to carry. They tie up the ducks, leave the beam pistols, and go out to create an opening in the vault's wall to allow the money to flow out from the Money Bin. At that time, the ducks exploit the situation, they free themselves from the ropes with the help of the beam pistols. Scrooge hurries to the roof terrace and shoots an anti-inertia beam at the tools the Beagle Boys are using to bust a hole in the wall, which makes their tools useless. At last the Beagle Boys catch on, and attack simultaneously with many bulldozers. At the same time, the beam gun runs out of power, and the excessive use of the ray guns has weakened the concrete in the walls. The bin cracks like an egg, and the money masses wave over Duckburg and wash down the drain network owned by Scrooge. The ducks leave to rescue the money with Donald Duck's car, which now also is free from inertia and therefore amazingly fast. The money is caught on barges and carried back to the Money bin. Later, Scrooge shoots the Beagle Boys with both beam pistols and then shoves them into prison with a flick of his finger. Back in the second Money Bin, Scrooge is getting all of his money flowing back inside. Donald reminds him about the deal, where Scrooge promised to give him as many thousand-dollar bills that he can hold if he can protect his money. Scrooge gives them to him, but because the money is still friction-less, the money simply flows out of Donald's arms and back into the vault.

The company develops concepts, design and interiors of habitats and vehicles. The project that first brought the company into the public eye was the Galactic Suite Space Resort, which intends to develop a private small space station at LEO, the orbital segment of a space tourism experience, which will also include intensive training on a tropical island. Galactic Suite Design is also the lead company in the consortium of companies fielding the Barcelona Moon Team, a competitor for the Google Lunar X Prize, with a Moon launch scheduled for 2014.  Galactic Suite Space Resort  The Galactic Suite Space Resort was a 2007 concept proposal for an orbital space station.  History  The Galactic Suite Space Resort space station began as a hobby for Xavier Claramunt, architect and director of Galactic Suite Design. The station reportedly entered development after an unnamed space enthusiast invested to build it. An unnamed American company with the goal of colonising Mars assisted in some of the early stages of the project, and discussions with additional private investors from Japan, the United States and the United Arab Emirates have taken place. 2006 illustration of an early design for the Galactic Suite Space Resort alongside a Space Shuttle. Early design concepts called for a central hub with a dozen modules radiating outwards, providing an indefinite number of bedrooms for several customers at a time. Claramunt said that while it would be a challenge to design a bathroom that works in microgravity, showers might be taken in a spa room with bubbles of floating water. The issue of moving around in space would be solved by having guests wear suits of Velcro for sticking to the module walls, similar to its use in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. The station was to conceivably orbit the Earth once every 90 minutes, providing 16 day-and-night cycles every 24 hours. The company stated in 2010 that a three-day stay was projected to cost per customer. Company studies found that 40,000 people worldwide were capable of affording such a stay. This complete space tourism experience would also notionally include the design of a \\"James Bond-style astronaut training\\" center and spaceport which will be based in the Caribbean. The spaceport would also house a new launch system built with safety and the environment in mind. In 2008, Claramunt stated that construction of the station would begin in October of that year, and that European company EADS Astrium would be the contractor in charge of building the modules and other equipment. However, Astrium denied any involvement in the project. In November 2010, the company announced that a first phase would bring into orbit a single modified ATV module for a cost of , while a second phase would increase the total number of modules up to four in a cross configuration.  Criticism  Some experts, including Thomas Bouvet (International Astronautical Federation), Mark Homnick (4Frontiers) and Juan de Dalmau (Centro Tecnol√≥gico para la Industria Aeron√°utica y del Espacio) expressed skepticism about the project, raising concerns that Galactic Suite would be unable to meet the 2012 goal because no hardware had been built and tested, and that no rocket system was available to transport guests to the station. The stated investment to the company is an issue since the identity of the investor has not been revealed. The investment might fall short of covering all the project's needs; for example, the suborbital shuttle proposed by EADS Astrium would cost , and the conversion of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle into a human-rated transport system would cost around .  Barcelona Moon Team  Galactic Suite Design is the lead company in a consortium of companies fielding the Barcelona Moon Team in the Google Lunar X Prize competition. GSD does so through a filial company, Galactic Suite Moon Race. BMT is the official candidate to the GLXP. The team is a multidisciplinary joint venture bringing together Spanish entrepreneurial, industrial and academic capabilities. The team also includes the Centre of Aerospace Technology in Barcelona (CTAE), the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) or the international engineering advisory firm Altran. BMT wants to promote a widening involvement of private initiative in the development of space technology and industry, also including sectors such as exploration and tourism. The Barcelona Moon Team GXLP mission was scheduled to launch aboard a Chinese Long March 2C in June 2015. However, the team later withdrew their entry from the competition.

Jackson (born 1940) is a New Zealand poet and anthropologist who has taught in anthropology departments at Massey University, the Australian National University, Indiana University Bloomington, and the University of Copenhagen. He is currently distinguished professor of world religions at Harvard Divinity School. Career Jackson is the founder of existential anthropology, a non-traditional sub-field of anthropology using ethnographic methods and drawing on traditions of phenomenology, existentialism, and critical theory, as well as American pragmatism, in exploring the human condition from the perspectives of both lifeworlds and worldviews, histories and biographies, collective representations and individual realities. The struggle for being involves a struggle to reconcile shared and singular experiences, acting and being acted upon, being for others and being for oneself. But rather than polarise subject and object, Jackson emphasises the intersubjective negotiations at the heart of all relationships ‚Äì whether between persons, persons and things, persons and language ‚Äì and shows that being-in-the-world consists of endless dilemmas and constant oscillations in consciousness that admit of only temporary, imagined, narrative or ritualised resolutions. Insofar as anthropological understanding is attained through conversations and events in which the ethnographer's prejudices, ontological assumptions, and emotional dispositions are at play, the ethnographer cannot pretend to be an impartial observer, producing objective knowledge. Jackson's published work fully discloses the contexts in which understandings are negotiated, arrived at, or, in some instances, unattainable.Personal page on Harvard Divinity School Jackson's recent books have explored diverse topics such as well-being in one of the world's poorest societies (Life Within Limits), the relation between religious experience and limit situations (The Palm at the End of the Mind), the interplay between egocentric and sociocentric modes of being (Between One and One Another), and writing as a technology for creating connections that transcend the limits of ordinary communication (The Other Shore). Fieldwork He has conducted fieldwork among the Kuranko of Sierra Leone from 1969, among the Warlpiri of Australia's Northern Territory between 1989 and 1991, and among the Kuku Yalangi of Cape York Peninsula in 1993 and 1994. His poetry has appeared in Poetry NZ. and in the Poetry Archive (UK). One critic wrote: In Dead Reckoning, Jackson deploys \\"a navigator‚Äôs term for estimating one‚Äôs location based upon extrapolations of distance and direction from one‚Äôs last-known position.

Plot In Batman's first episode of the second season, The Archer, a villain modeled after Robin Hood, escapes from Police Headquarters in a moving van from the Trojan Hearse Company, driven by Maid Marilyn. Together, with his band of \\"merry malefactors\\" - Crier Tuck and Big John (a play on Friar Tuck and Little John, respectively) - he pays a surprise visit to Wayne Manor. The inhabitants are gassed and cash is stolen. Later, the crew attacks Police Headquarters. When they are giving out other stolen cash they are apprehended by Batman and Robin. The Gotham citizens enriched by the muggers save them from arrest. Batman and Robin trace the Archer to his hideout at the Earl of Huntington Archery Range (Robin Hood was the alias of the Earl of Huntingdon) in Gotham's Green Forest section, where Alfred Pennyworth attempts to divert the antagonists long enough for Batman and Robin to inspect his lair. The two are trapped in a giant net. The Archer threatens to behead Alfred if he does not get the location of the Batcave, so the crime computers can be destroyed. Knowing the guillotine is fake, Batman refuses and challenges Quigley to a fair duel. The Archer then sets up Batman and Robin to be skewered by lances.

Other Christian groups having significant followings in the country include Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism (Lutheranism). Islam, Judaism and Hinduism are small minorities in Slovenia. About 18% of the population are either agnostic or atheist.Slovenia Statistical Office. Population by religion, statistical regions, Census 2002. Religion played a significant role in the development of the Slovenian nation and of the country of Slovenia. After a centuries-long tradition of a state church, interrupted by the periods of Protestant Reformation (in the 16th century) and post‚ÄìWorld War II socialism (which ousted religion from the public life), a degree of separation of the state and the church has been reached in independent Slovenia. In February 2007 Slovenia passed a new Religious Freedom Act with a bias towards the Catholic Church (particularly in regard to state funding) and strict terms for the registration of new religious communities. Religions=ChristianityCatholic Church= The Catholic Church in Slovenia is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. There are around 1,135,626 Catholics in the country (about 57.8% of the total population as per the 2002 Census). The country is divided into six dioceses, including two archdioceses. The diocese of Maribor was elevated to an archdiocese by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006. Additionally, the pope created three new sees, namely Novo Mesto, Celje and Murska Sobota. =Protestantism= Protestantism is tightly-knit with the history of Slovenians, with the Slovenian language having been established in the Reformation. Primo≈æ Trubar was a leading early Slovenian author and a Protestant reformer. He contributed to the development of the Slovenian language and Slovenian culture. The Reformation flourished in the 16th century, accounting for the vast majority of cultural development in Slovenian. Lutheranism was the most popular Protestant denomination among Slovenians, with minorities, most notably Calvinism. Protestantism among Slovenians was aggressively attempted to be wiped out by the Habsburgs with the Counter-Reformation. The Counter- Reformation was heavily deployed to the majority of Slovenian-speaking territory. Means used involved murder, extradition, book-burning and a general ban of the Slovenian language. Excluded were eastern regions (such as Prekmurje), ruled by Hungarian nobility, often Calvinist. Historically, Hungarians had taken up Lutheranism first, before gradually switching to Calvinism. They did not have a policy of extinguishing Lutheranism. Protestantism among Slovenians survived the Counter-Reformation scattered. Protestantism is a minority group of Christian denominations in the Republic of Slovenia today. The largest community of Protestant Slovenians lives in the Prekmurje region, most of them are Lutheran. =Eastern Orthodoxy= Eastern Orthodoxy maintains a significant presence in the country and is practised in majority by Slovenians of Serbian heritage. Eastern Orthodox Christians in Slovenia are under ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Zagreb and Ljubljana. Islam The Muslims in Slovenia are ethnically mostly Bosniaks and other Slavic Muslims. In 2014, there were 48,266 Muslims in Slovenia, making up about 2.4 percent of the total population. The Muslim community of Slovenia is headed by . According to the published data from the 2002 Slovenian census, out of a total of 47,488 Muslims (2.4% of the total population) 2,804 Muslims (5.90% of the total Muslims in Slovenia) declared themselves as ethnic Slovenian Muslims. There are also Muslims from Central, South and Southeast Asia, who are not counted in the census because they are migrant workers. Judaism The small Jewish community of Slovenia () is estimated at 400 to 600 members, with the Jewish community of Slovenia suggesting 500 to 1000 members. Around 130 are officially registered, most of whom live in the capital, Ljubljana. The Jewish community was devastated by the Shoah, and has never fully recovered. Until 2003, Ljubljana was the only European capital city without a Jewish place of worship.Jewish Virtual Library - Slovenia Hinduism 220 Hindus live in Slovenia, with 70 belonging to the Hindu Religious Community in Slovenia and 150 belonging to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon).http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-VNL24FNV/?

A further 34.3% declared to have no religion, and 1.5% declared to belong to other religions.  Religious freedom  Slovenia's laws guarantee the freedom of religion and establish a separation between church and state, as well as prohibiting religious discrimination and religious hatred. Religious groups may easily register with the government in order to receive some privileges, largely consisting of various forms of monetary compensation. Slovenia's laws prohibit circumcision for non-medical reasons and animal slaughtering practices that are necessary for meat to be considered kosher or halal. Members of the Jewish and Muslim communities observe these practices outside of the country (importing meat, and traveling to neighboring countries for religious circumcision) without obstruction from Slovenia's government.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Slovenia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.

The film was selected as the Taiwan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 63rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot In 1973, 26-year-old Cheung Hueyin is abroad in London studying media. Upon her graduation, she learns that she, unlike her white roommates, has been rejected the chance for a job interview by the BBC. Receiving a letter from her mother, she returns to Hong Kong to attend her younger sister's wedding. The relationship between Hueyin and mother Aiko, who is Japanese, has been strained since childhood, partly a result of Aiko's nationality and the cultural problems she encountered living in Hong Kong. From many flashbacks, we see it was Hueyin's paternal grandparents who did much of the early child- rearing, however, they would often overstep boundaries, resulting in family dysfunction. Before the end of World War II and before eventually becoming Mrs. Cheung and Hueyin's mother, Aiko spent time living in Manchukuo. There, she and other Japanese faced serious dilemmas after Japan's defeat and the subsequent uncertainties of imprisonment and punishment. The most intense of these dilemmas came with the serious illness of Aiko's infant nephew. His illness was eventually cured by Mr. Cheung after a chance encounter and desperate roadside plea for help by Aiko. Mr. Cheung was an army translator from Guangdong, China with a background in traditional Chinese medicine. Aiko developed a sense of fondness for him upon seeing his actions and character. Aiko's brother concurred, mentioning that kindness toward children usually indicates a man of integrity. After Mr. Cheung escorted Aiko's family to the Japanese repatriation site, he revealed to Aiko a strong desire to be a romantic couple. In 1973, Hueyin reluctantly agrees to accompany Aiko on a visit to her birthplace in Beppu, Japan. Hueyin initially feels very out of place, not being able to speak the language and having no understanding of Japanese culture. Eventually, though, she bonds with an uncle, learns to accept her Japanese heritage, and finally reaches an understanding with her mother. The experience encourages Hueyin to move beyond the BBC's rejection and become a successful television journalist in Hong Kong. Some time later, Aiko encourages Hueyin to visit her paternal grandparents in Guangdong, where Hueyin finds out one of her very youngest relatives has a mental disability. The film ends with Hueyin praying before a dimly lit, incense-choked ancestral altar, contrasting the open-air shrine she visited in Japan and the outdoor political rallies she now reports on.

The book is the sequel to the New York Times bestselling book, Stargirl, and centers on \\"the world's longest letter\\" in diary form. It picks up where the previous novel left off after Stargirl left Mica High and describes her bittersweet memories in the town of Mica, Arizona along with the involvements of new people in her life, in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.Kids@Random  Catalog  Love, Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli Plot New in town, homeschooled, and feeling rejected by Leo, the 16-year-old narrator of the first book who had fallen under her spell, she is lonely and sad‚Äîher \\"happy wagon,\\" where she keeps stones representing her level of happiness, is almost empty. She befriends Dootsie, a noisy but lovable 6-year-old who takes a shine to Stargirl and wants to switch. Dootsie introduces her to Betty Lou, an agoraphobic elderly woman. She is quite nice and Stargirl soon becomes friends with her as well. They also share a very nice time watching flowers together. With the arrival of autumn, Stargirl's life is affected as she meets several new characters: Alvina, a grumpy young girl who delivers donuts to Betty Lou; Perry, a teen boy who Alvina is falling in love with; and Perry's \\"harem,\\" The Honeybees. As winter sets in, Stargirl plans a Winter Solstice party, inviting all of the people she has encountered in her new town to celebrate the beginning of winter by joining her at sunrise on her Enchanted Hill, which she now calls Calendar Hill. Stargirl also discovers the truth about Perry, who has been very mysterious about his family and personal life. She learns his mother has a new baby, whom Perry has been trying to support by working several jobs and by resorting to \\"stealing\\" to avoid burdening her with feeding him. In the end, Stargirl becomes worried that no one will show up for her solstice party, but is reassured by Archie, her former teacher, and friend from Arizona, who arrives to attend her celebration and comforts her with his wisdom. On the morning of the day, Stargirl is overwhelmed and surprised when a huge crowd of her friends and acquaintances, and several other people she's unfamiliar with, flock to Calendar Hill, including her friend Betty Lou who hasn't left her house in nine years. The magic moment of sunrise is magnified by a special tent her parents have built, allowing the sunlight to stream in through a hole in the tent, forming a single beam that cuts through the crowd of people and pierces the back wall. Everyone is profoundly affected by the start of this new day and returns home to the start of a cold winter. In the end, Stargirl asks Archie what she should do about missing Leo, and about Perry. He tells her to remember who she is and do what her heart tells her. Characters * Susan Julia \\"Stargirl\\" Caraway is a unique teenager that has no boundaries when it comes to clothing or acts of kindness. She would go to the ends of the earth to achieve happiness, not for herself, but others. She has many quirky acts that she not-so-subtly pulls off throughout the book, like dropping pennies on the sidewalk, starting a gardening business, meditating, befriending little girls, and going on milk runs with her father, a milkman. Her best friend is Dootsie, a spunky six-year-old that also has no boundaries... for anything. Her love interest is Perry Delloplane, though he sends her mixed messages, going so far as to invite her to join his harem. However, throughout the book she struggles with her feelings, trying to understand how she's feeling and whether her heart belongs to Leo or Perry. * Leo Borlock is Stargirl's former love interest from Mica, Arizona. During the time of this novel, she is writing the world's longest letter to Leo, documenting her days and adventures with her new friends and difficulties in her new town. Leo broke Stargirl's heart, but she still loves him, only finalizing her choice between Leo and Perry when she shares a kiss with Perry at Calendar Hill, but says later she didn't think they were right for each other. Leo is mentioned many times in the book. * Dootsie Pringle is a spunky six-year-old that is quick to befriend Stargirl after discovering her meditating on a table. Dootsie is outgoing and chats to anyone that comes her way. She is attention seeking, often running away, or pretending to be invisible, thinking it will attract attention, seeing as everyone pretends they can't see her. She also befriends Betty Lou Fern, an older agoraphobic neighbor of hers, mostly because of Betty Lou gifts Dootsie with yummy homemade treats and donuts. * Perry Delloplane is a juvenile boy about Stargirl's age. He is seen to be a delinquent, telling people he went to boot camp for a year, when he was actually staying with his aunt. His mother is pregnant, and when his little sister is born, he shows a surprisingly caring, gentle side, and is extremely protective. He has an affection for Dootsie. He likes to joke around with her, and she as well is quite smitten with him, even joining his harem. * The Honeybees are Perry's harem, a club of open admirers who all fancy him. He feels no shame in kissing them in public, often in front of other harem members, who don't mind, and going on dates with them, but never seriously. * Betty Lou Fern is the agoraphobic middle-aged neighbor of Stargirl and Dootsie. She never leaves her house, and Stargirl and Dootsie come to visit her almost everyday. Betty Lou gifts them with delicious treats, like Margie's donuts. Betty Lou has a soft spot for mockingbirds and flowers but was forced to give up their beauty after her fear becomes worse. Betty Lou always has great advice for Stargirl on her romance indecision, and almost stands in place for Archie. She had a husband, whom she nicknamed \\"Mr. Potato Nose\\" * Alvina Klecko is a very unsociable tween going through a transformation between her tomboyish ways and her dolls. She tends to have a very confrontational demeanor, often pretending to ignore Stargirl's preachings, but listens and almost always heeds them in the end. She delivers Betty Lou's Donuts, even after she was fired from Margie's. Alvina is also shown to have a little crush on Perry Delloplane, and a blond boy from her school. * Margie is the owner of a doughnut shop in the town Stargirl moves to. Her donuts are famous in town. She is most famous for her crazy doughnut inventions, like donut pie and donut soup. She is also very talkative, chatting to anyone that comes through the door, taking a particular liking to Stargirl. * Charlie is an old man who sits in the cemetery every day by his wife's grave, supposedly listening and talking to her. Stargirl first approached him by leaving donuts for him, which took a few tries, then eventually brought Dootsie along with her. This action made them friends, and Dootsie and Stargirl often go down to visit them, Stargirl mostly questioning about Grace, his deceased wife and himself. * The Huffelmeyers are an old couple that Stargirl's father delivers milk to. She recognizes them for their old-fashioned ways. * Cinnamon is Stargirl's pet rat.

F.S.L. Lyons (1960, p. 155) incorrectly refers to him as 'Matthew'. (8 October 1850 ‚Äì 7 June 1933) was an Irish nationalist politician and MP. in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Anti-Parnellite representative for North Roscommon, 1892‚Äì95, a noted author, journalist and newspaper editor, barrister (King's Counsel (K.C.)), and County Court Judge for County Clare, 1907‚Äì24. Early life Bodkin was the second son of a doctor, Thomas Bodkin, MD FRCSI, of Tuam, County Galway (a descendant of Tribes of Galway). His mother was Maria McDonnell of Westport, County Mayo, a cousin of Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell (1844‚Äì1925). Bodkin was educated at the Christian Brothers' school, Tuam and at Tullabeg Jesuit College. He had wanted to go to the Anglican Trinity College, Dublin but his family objected on religious grounds and he attended the Catholic University of Ireland, which had a strong Roman Catholic ethos, instead. He was scathing about this experience: > \\"It is true I entered the so-called Catholic University, which had neither > charter or endowment, and even obtained an exhibition on matriculation, but > the business was so wholly futile that I abandoned it before six months was > over, sacrificing my exhibition. A smattering of Terence was the only asset > derived from that wasted six months.\\"Bodkin (1914), p. 25. Career=Early legal career Bodkin was called to the Irish Law Bar in 1877 and entered practice as a barrister on the Connaught circuit. Journalistic career Bodkin's journalistic career began with reporting work for the Freeman's Journal while he was still a law student. He became politically active at the time of the Coercion Act of 1887, and defended a number of Irish Nationalists in court. He first came to political prominence at the time of the split in the Irish Parliamentary Party over the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, when Bodkin was a major protagonist on the anti- Parnellite Irish National Federation side. As deputy to William O'Brien, editor of the newspaper United Ireland, he was in charge of the paper in O'Brien's absence in the USA at the time of the split in December 1890, and brought it firmly out against Parnell. He was ousted from the editor's office by force when Parnell and his supporters reclaimed the paper. He published an alternative Suppressed United Ireland and then The Insuppressible, which appeared up to 24 January 1891. Thereafter Bodkin was a leader writer on the Insuppressible's anti-Parnellite successor, the National Press. Political career At Timothy Healy's urging, Bodkin stood for Parliament against the veteran Parnellite J.J. O'Kelly at North Roscommon in 1892, winning by 3,251 votes to 3,199, a margin of only 52 votes. He later wrote an account of the election campaign (and of his legal experiences) in White Magic (1897). He stood down at the end of his first term in 1895, saying that he could not afford to continue losing earnings from the Bar: \\"my poverty, and not my will, refused\\".Bodkin (1914), p. 244 O'Kelly regained the seat. Thereafter Bodkin was chief leader writer on the Freeman's Journal. Jointly with Thomas Sexton he founded The Irish Packet in 1903. Later legal career Bodkin's appointment as a County Court judge in 1907 was controversial among Nationalists who thought that offices should not be accepted from the British regime. The appointment was subjected to an unsuccessful legal challenge on the ground that Bodkin had retired from the Bar at the time; when asked in Parliament what had induced the (illiterate) complainant to lodge his affidavit against Bodkin, the then Chief Secretary for Ireland, Augustine Birrell, replied, apparently with complete truth: ‚ÄòA pint of porter‚Äô.Bodkin (1914), p.350 Maume (1999, p. 92) says Bodkin had ‚Äòdubious legal qualifications‚Äô, but there is no doubt that he had wide experience as a barrister and on his own account had defended some twenty people on capital charges.Bodkin (1914), p. 140 While a judge in 1921, Bodkin published accounts of abuses by the Black and Tans in County Clare, which received wide publicity. Writings Bodkin was a prolific author, in a wide range of genres, including history, novels (contemporary and historical), plays, and political campaigning texts. The catalogues of the British Library and National Library of Ireland list some 39 publications between them. Some books were published under the nom de plume Crom a Boo. Bodkin earned a place in the history of the detective novel by virtue of his invention of the first detective family. His character Paul Beck, a private detective with comfortable lodgings in Chester, was an Irish Sherlock Holmes with a very original yet logical method for detecting crime. Beck first appeared in Paul Beck, the rule of thumb detective in 1899. In the following year Bodkin's creation Dora Myrl, the lady detective, made her first appearance. In The Capture of Paul Beck (1909), Bodkin had them marry each other and in 1911 their son appeared, in Paul Beck, a chip off the old block. Other titles in this series were The Quests of Paul Beck (1908), Pigeon Blood Rubies (1915) and Paul Beck, detective (1929). Bodkin's historical novel Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1896) was dedicated to William Gladstone with the latter's permission. It was one of three novels set at the time of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Bodkin's autobiography Recollections of an Irish Judge is a valuable historical source, particularly on the Parnellite split, although being published when he was only 64 it does not cover the last 20 years of his life. Its title is misleading since it contains little on Bodkin's life as a judge, but a great deal on his experiences in politics and journalism.

Leoni also pointed to a parallelism between the market and common law on the one hand, and socialism and legislation on the other. Through a review of Roman doctrine and jurisprudence, Leoni shows that the Romans thought of Law as a process of discovery instead as of a set of enacted orders, and that the popular confusion between law and legislation is contemporary to our era and the advent of socialism.

By issuing a below average number of bases on balls he exhibits good control of his pitches. Pitchers with good control are said to be able to throw all the pitches in their repertoire for strikes in different locations regardless of the batter, count and score. According to Curt Schilling, \\"Control is the ability to throw strikes, and command is the ability to throw quality strikes.\\" Another definition of control is \\"The ability to deliver the ball to the plate with accuracy.\\" The best control pitchers will walk as few as one batter per game. Control is also key to getting ahead in the count, and thus gaining the advantage over batters to keep them off base. Statistics used to measure control include: * Walks per nine innings * Strikeout-to-walk ratio Control pitchers, who succeed by avoiding surrendering walks, are different from power pitchers who succeed by striking out batters and keeping the ball out of play. Three of the most famous examples of control pitchers in the history of baseball are Christy Mathewson, Ferguson Jenkins, and Greg Maddux, though Maddux and Jenkins have also had significant strikeout totals (they are members of the 3,000 strikeout club) because of their ability to change speeds and the deceptive nature of their pitches.

The medical procedure via which ears are reshaped to give a normal appearance is known as otoplasty. Ear shaping is usually performed by body modification artists. There are several ways in which human ears can be given a different appearance including cropping, pointing, and the amputation of various parts of the ear. The various methods may be combined to give specific results. Amputation In this form of ear shaping, the lobe or other portions of the ear are amputated to give the desired look. This may also be undertaken to remove stretched portions that are no longer wanted. Sutures or cauterizing may be required. Cropping Ear cropping is commonly performed on animals, for both cosmetic and other reasons, but rarely on humans. In humans, cropping usually involves the removal of part of the upper ear with a scalpel. Suturing or cauterizing may be required. Pointing Ear pointing or \\"elfing\\" by various methods is undertaken to give them an appearance similar to that of elves or Vulcans. A common method is to remove a small wedge-shaped portion at the top of the ear, and then suture the two edges. The development of this procedure is generally credited to Steve Haworth. Originally the shape was achieved by folding and trimming the client's helix and sutured together to achieve a pointed look. But a new procedure has been developed by Samppa Von Cyborg, which gives the pointed ears a far more natural look.Alternate ear pointing methods References Category:Body modification Category:Ear surgery ","title":"Ear shaping"},{"id":"12716105","text":"East Hampshire Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in England was designated in 1962.

Born in Arbroath, Buick started his career with home-town Arbroath F.C., where he stayed until 1896. In July of that year he joined Hearts, answering an advertisement from the then reigning Scottish Cup holders. He appeared infrequently as Hearts won the 1896-97 League title but became a more regular player the following season. He played in Hearts 1900-01 Scottish Cup win, where the Edinburgh side defeated Celtic 4-3 in the final and was club captain by the time the side reached the 1902-03 final, where they lost to Rangers. Buick's appearance led many commentators to consider him an unlikely defender. He measured only 5 foot 7 inches tall, had a slight stoop and his long, gangly arms earned him the nickname \\"spider\\". However, his all-action style and stamina earned him many admirers and two caps for the Scottish national team in March 1902. These came against Ireland and Wales and Buick scored in both games as Scotland won 5-1 on each occasion. The stature of his contemporary and rival for the centre-half position, Alex Raisbeck, was said to have ensured he didn't win more honours. Buick moved south to Southern Football League side Portsmouth in 1903 and was eventually joined by six former Hearts teammates. He spent eight season with Pompey, most notably helping the team to an upset victory over Manchester United in an 1906-07 FA Cup replay.

He has been awarded the Right Livelihood Award, the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship and The Order of the Golden Ark in recognition of his work with Fundacion Gaia Amazonas and the COAMA program. Known as an activist for indigenous rights, cultural and ecological diversity, his work in both government and non-government sectors have led to more than 26 million hectares of the Colombian Amazon territory being officially handed back to the local indigenous inhabitants enabling indigenous organisations to manage their own education, health and other programs through local governance and state policy decentralisation. Hildebrand established in 1990 the COAMA program, winner of the Right Livelihood Award, and is founding Director of the NGO Fundaci√≥n Gaia Amazonas, ranked #40 among the top 100 NGOs of the world by the Global Journal. Personal Background Mart√≠n von Hildebrand, a nationalized Colombian, was born in New York City on 26 January 1943. He moved to Colombia in 1948 when his parents, Franz von Hildebrand (son of philosopher Dietrich von Hildebrand ) and Deirdre Mulcahy, were invited to Bogot√° to establish the University de los Andes. He spent his childhood living with his family in the building that is today the University‚Äôs Law Faculty. Hildebrand studied at the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais, Bogot√°, and later studied sociology at University College, Dublin, from where he graduated in 1968. In 1979 he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris for a Doctorate in Ethnology. He has three sons and three grandchildren. Territorial rights and local governance in the Colombian Amazon Klaus Schwab and Mart√≠n von Hildebrand (Rio de Janeiro, 2009) Learning from the indigenous communities An intense involvement with environmental and indigenous issues began in the early 1970s after a period living among Tanimuka and Letuama indigenous communities in the Colombian Amazon, learning about their cosmology and traditional practices for safeguarding the environment. For the indigenous peoples of the Colombian Amazon, the forest is their habitat and means of survival, with both aesthetic and spiritual importance. Their traditional knowledge, acquired over centuries of interaction with their surrounding environment, leads the communities to protect and sustain the forest ecosystem. Since the 1950s, however, the Colombian Amazon and its indigenous peoples have suffered from waves of colonization and exploitation: peasant refugees during the time of 'La Violencia'; colonists following in the wake of petroleum exploration; economic booms for rubber extraction, gold mining and the illicit processing of coca; government and aid-agency sponsored resettlement and development programs. Aside from the environmental devastation, the indigenous people have suffered a loss of traditional rights to their territory and sustainable livelihood options. In 1972, Hildebrand set up the Amazon branch of the Colombian Anthropological Institute, in La Pedrera, through which he was able to bring together a multi-disciplinary team of specialists (biologists, lawyers, anthropologists, doctors and educationists). The most essential principle in this process was that local indigenous communities were given a real opportunity to choose their own path of 'development'. They had access to the information they needed and the freedom to assess their situation according to their own cultural view. It was within this context that Hildebrand insisted that the single most important mission that he would commit himself, obviously with the backing of the Indians, was the establishment of land rights over their traditional territory. Without this their future, their traditions and the forest itself faced destruction. Single-mindedly Hildebrand pursued this goal at every opportunity. Developing Colombia's Amazon Policy After a brief departure from Colombia in 1979, to complete a Doctorate in Ethnology at the Sorbonne, Hildebrand returned to work with the Ministry of Education and establish government policy on ethno-education. In 1986, he became Head of Indigenous Affairs and advisor to President Virgilio Barco Vargas (1986‚Äì1990). This provided an important foothold for encouraging government policy favorable to indigenous rights. The backing of President Barco gave an important impetus for the new Political Constitution and ratification of International Labour Organization Convention No. 169, an essential framework for securing indigenous rights in Colombia. Between 1986-1990 the Colombian Government legally recognised 200,000 square kilometres of rainforest in the Colombian Amazon region as 'collective indigenous territory' ‚Äì resguardos (1). This policy was an unprecedented move towards the recognition of indigenous rights and the important role of forest peoples in the conservation of the world's tropical rainforests. As Government representative in the Amazon Pact, Hildebrand also pushed for the creation of a Special Commission on Indian Affairs and another on the Environment, giving an ecological stance to the implementation of the Pact. COAMA program In 1990, Hildebrand decided to leave government to become more directly involved in grassroots work in the Amazon. The recognition of indigenous territorial rights was, in the words of Hildebrand, just the beginning of the process. What followed was the need for work to ensure that the Indians had the necessary backing to administer their territories according to their traditions. Hildebrand launched the COAMA program, involving a small network of NGOs and indigenous organizations, and founded Fundaci√≥n Gaia Amazonas, a non-government organization. COAMA has provided an innovative approach towards working with indigenous communities and developing self-governance as the basis for tropical forest preservation. It has been commended by the World Commission on Forest and Sustainable Development, and funded by mainly by the European Commission and the governments of Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. Hildebrand also started a trans-boundary initiative, CANOA, with indigenous organizations and NGOs that are active in northwest Amazon region, to protect nearly 700.000km2 of continuous and well-preserved tropical forest across a region by Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela.

Plot synopsis From the last episode, just as the Dynamic Duo are about to be impaled, they activate Batsprings hidden in their boots, which catapult them out of harm's way. Rather than go back after the unshiskebabed superheroes, the Archer (Art Carney) and his \\"merry malefactors\\" opt to beat a hasty retreat to their new hideout in the basement of police headquarters. Next, the Archer and his men hijack an armored car carrying $10 million, which the Wayne Foundation plans to donate to the destitute Gothamites. The truck is later found abandoned not too short a distance away with the cash left untouched, so the ceremony commences as planned. Whilst Alfred Pennyworth (Alan Napier), in disguise as Batman, and Robin bear witness from across the street, Bruce Wayne attends the ceremony, where it's learned that the Archer has substituted the money in the truck for counterfeit currency bearing the Archer's picture. Batman deduces that Alan A. Dale, one of the Wayne Foundation's directors who was responsible for the money's well-being, is one of the Archer's malefactors, and they are planning to escape by boat to Switzerland in the international waters of the Atlantic Ocean, where they feel they'll be forever protected from the law...or so they assume. The Dynamic Duo chase the villains by Batboat and rout the Archer, Crier Tuck (Doodles Weaver), Big John (Loren Ewing), Maid Marilyn (Barbara Nichols), and Alan A. Dale (Robert Cornthwaite) before they get the chance. Maid Marilyn gives Batman & Robin swords with which to defend themselves. Later, Bruce, Dick and Alfred perform archery on their front lawn. Alfred offers to shoot an apple off Dick Grayson's head. Instead they place the apple on a target, which Alfred misses. NEXT WEEK Batman faces The Catwoman!

VTEC-E (for \\"Efficiency\\") is a form of VTEC that closes off one intake valve at low RPMs to give good economy at low power levels, while \\"VTEC\\" is a mode that allows for greater power at high RPMs, while giving relatively efficient performance at \\"normal\\" operating speeds. \\"Three-stage VTEC\\" gives both types in one engine, at the cost of greater complexity and expense. Stage 1 ‚Äì 12-valve VTEC-E VTEC-E (economy) was designed to achieve better fuel economy, at the cost of performance. The engine operates in \\"12-valve mode\\", where one intake valve per cylinder in the 16-valve engine remains mostly closed to attain lean burn. The lean burn mode gets the air to fuel ratio above the 14.7:1 stoichiometric ratio and thus enables extra fuel saving. This works similarly to the principle which gave the Buick \\"Nailhead\\" V8 its reputation for high torque (in that case, the engine had notably small intake valves, giving good torque, but limiting peak power). In an engine running at lower RPMs, a smaller intake valve area forces a given volume of air to flow into the chamber faster; this causes the fuel to atomize better, and therefore burn far more efficiently. An average of can be achieved while in lean burn at a constant speed of . Stage 2 ‚Äì 16 valve At about 2500RPM and further the engine is able to switch to the 16-valve mode, which is usual to the classic engines. The first VTEC solenoid is opened and directs the oil to the sliding pin that connects the rocker arms of the intake valves with the first intake valve's lobe. Thus all the two intake valves are moving at the normal profile of that lobe. The engine's performance is usual to the non-VTEC engines. This mode is suitable for mid-range RPMs. Stage 3 ‚Äì 16-valve VTEC From ~5200 RPM to the rev limiter, the engine's high-lift VTEC cam lobe is engaged. A higher lift lowers restriction even more, giving the highest airflow. If one built a non-VTEC engine to make the maximum power, the trade-off would be very low efficiency at low RPMs in order to get the most flow possible at high RPMs. A three-stage allows the engine to run in \\"economy\\", \\"standard\\", and \\"high power\\" modes, while a VTEC only gives \\"standard\\" and \\"high power\\", and a VTEC-E only gives \\"economy\\" and \\"standard\\".

As an attorney, he played a role in organizing the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), the union that represents players in the National Football League. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame and the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame in 1976. Miller was born in Cleveland, Ohio and was the seventh member of his family to play football at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. He was a star halfback for a Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team that won the national championship in 1943. Miller was named an All-American that year, finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting and led the nation in rushing yards, with 911. Miller was drafted by the Brooklyn Tigers of the National Football League (NFL) but did not play professionally because of high blood pressure. He coached briefly at Notre Dame and as an assistant in 1946 for the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference before becoming a lawyer practicing in Cleveland. Working with Browns players including Dante Lavelli and Abe Gibron, he helped found the NFLPA in 1956 and served as its first legal counsel. He stayed in the position until 1968, the same year the union was recognized by the NFL. Miller continued to practice law in Cleveland, specializing in maritime and asbestos litigation, until his death in 2002. Early life and college career Miller was born in Cleveland, Ohio, into a family of athletes. He attended DuPont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, and was the seventh member of his family to play football at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Harry Miller, his father, was an All-American halfback at the school and the captain of the Fighting Irish football team in 1908. One of his uncles, Don Miller, was part of the dominant 1924 Notre Dame backfield nicknamed the Four Horsemen. His brother Tom played with him at the school in 1941 and 1942. Miller was named after Creighton University, where his father was coaching when he was born. Miller was a standout halfback at Notre Dame under head coach Frank Leahy starting in 1941. He rushed for 151 yards in a 1942 game against Northwestern University, a single-game school record that stood until 1974. In 1943, he led the nation in rushing with 911 yards. He scored 13 touchdowns and came in fourth in Heisman Trophy voting as Notre Dame finished with a 9‚Äì1 win-loss record and won the national championship. He was named a consensus All-American and was chosen to play in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual matchup between the champions of the National Football League (NFL) and a squad of the best college players from around the country. As he succeeded on the field, Miller's independent streak became increasingly apparent. To Leahy's frustration, he skipped spring practices every year of his Notre Dame career to play golf, but the coach did not discipline Miller because he was the team's best halfback. Coaching and legal career Miller was selected by the NFL's Brooklyn Tigers with the third pick in the 1944 NFL Draft. High blood pressure, however, forced him to discontinue athletic activities. He stayed at Notre Dame in 1944 to coach and study law. The following year, Miller took a job as an assistant coach for the Cleveland Browns, a team in the new All- America Football Conference coached by Paul Brown. By the time he was hired by Browns owner Arthur B. McBride, whose son attended Notre Dame, he was studying law at Yale University and was a backfield coach for the school's football team. Miller was the team's first hire, and joined the Browns on August 1, 1946. He returned to Yale Law School at the end of the year, after the Browns won the AAFC championship. Miller coached with the Browns for one year, drawing a $5,200 salary ($ in dollars) that helped pay for law school. After graduating, he became an attorney practicing in Cleveland and was the Browns' legal counsel until McBride sold the team in 1953. In 1954, Browns end Dante Lavelli and guard Abe Gibron approached Miller about forming a union to represent players in the NFL, to which the Browns had moved in 1950. NFL salaries had gone up in the late 1950s compared to the decade before, but owners' profits were rising at an even more rapid rate as the sport gained in popularity. Players complained about not receiving salaries for exhibition games or pre-season training camps to which more than 60 men often participated but only 36 came away with roster spots. Major League Baseball players already had a players' union, and Lavelli and Gibron thought the NFL should have a similar organization advocating for their interests. Lavelli, Gibron, Miller and Browns quarterback George Ratterman met in Lavelli's basement in Rocky River, Ohio, on Wednesday nights to discuss the union idea. The men also met at Miller's office in downtown Cleveland. After two years of discussions and recruitment, they found 370 NFL players willing to support a union; the only holdouts were members of the Chicago Bears who were loyal to owner George Halas. In November 1956, Miller, along with Los Angeles Rams quarterback Norm Van Brocklin and New York Giants end Kyle Rote announced the formation of the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). The NFLPA demanded that players receive a $5,000 minimum annual salary and be paid during training camp and while unable to play due to football injury. The owners made some concessions, but refused to recognize the union. Miller threatened to sue the league under antitrust laws in 1957 unless owners recognized the union. He testified before the U.S. Congress in NFL antitrust hearings that players were \\"mousetrapped\\" by the owners into disadvantageous contracts. Miller earned $1,000 a year to advocate for the union, a salary some players said in 1960 was unjustified because of his tense relations with NFL owners and failure to get the union recognized. In 1967, retired Browns defensive back Bernie Parrish said Miller did not do enough to meet the players' demands and Parrish tried to form his own union. Miller served as the NFLPA's lawyer until 1968, when he resigned to focus on representing individual players as an agent negotiating contracts. The NFL officially recognized the union later in the year when the two sides negotiated their first collective bargaining agreement. Cleveland coach Paul Brown disliked Miller so much for his work with the NFLPA that he had him scrubbed from the Browns' 1946 team picture. Later career and death Later in his career, Miller was a maritime law and asbestos law specialist, and represented Cleveland native George Steinbrenner's American Shipbuilding Company in the 1960s.

The station currently features a classic country format. WBCO also airs 24 hours per day on FM translator W298CC at 107.5 FM. History WBCO was founded in 1962 by Thomas P. Moore and wife J. LaVonne Moore, along with LaVonne's brother and pioneer in broadcasting, Orville J. Sather, and investors. WBCO was joined by sister-station WBCO-FM (later named WQEL) two years later. The company was first known as Brokensword Broadcasting Co. When the Moores and Sathers bought out the investors, it became Sa-Mor Stations. Full ownership was assumed by Tom and LaVonne following Orville's death. The stations were sold to Mike and Donna Laipply in 1991. In 1996, both stations were sold to the Ohio Radio Group based in Ashland Ohio who also owned stations WQIO and WMVO in Mount Vernon, Ohio, WNCO & WNCO-FM in Ashland, Ohio, WMAN-FM in Fredericktown, Ohio, WFXN-FM in Galion, Ohio and WXXF in Loudonville, Ohio. They would later add local WYNT in Upper Sandusky, Ohio to the group making it the largest radio ownership company in Ohio. In 2001, Ohio Radio Group was purchased by Clear Channel Communications which had to sell two stations that included WBCO and WQEL who was purchased by Scantland Broadcasting, then current Saga Communications. The stations are now managed by Debbi Gifford, who was trained by and maintains a relationship with Tom and LaVonne.

He coaxed Lou Perini into moving them into the new County Stadium and the Braves later played in consecutive World Series in 1957 and 1958, both against the New York Yankees. Both series went the full seven games with Milwaukee winning the former and New York the latter. Death The father of two sons and six daughters, Miller was killed in a plane crash at age 48 on December 17, 1954.

It comprises AgustaWestland Wildcat HMA.2 helicopters and is the largest helicopter squadron in western Europe. History=Second World War HMS Illustrious, somewhere in 1942 A still flying example of a Fairey Swordfish The squadron formed at RNAS Worthy Down on 9 October 1939, from the remnants of 811 and 822 squadrons that had survived the sinking of their carrier in September 1939, with Fairey Swordfish aircraft. The squadron disbanded in November 1939 but reformed the same month. In May 1940 the squadron provided support to the Dunkirk evacuation. In June 1940, the squadron embarked on and sailed for the Mediterranean in August, attacking and minelaying Benghazi, Rhodes and Tobruk. The squadron gained early fame with its involvement in the Battle of Taranto in 1940, when the Italian Battlefleet in harbour at Taranto was raided; which redefined the use of air power from the sea. The aircraft of the commanding officer was lost, against the crippling of half the Italian fleet. In March 1941, the squadron fought in the Battle of Cape Matapan. The squadron re-equipped in August 1941, with a mixture of Swordfish and Fairey Albacore aircraft, operating from shore bases in support of the North African campaign. In July 1943, 815 Squadron was assigned to No. 201 (Naval Co-operation) Group with a detachment of Swordfish assigned to AHQ Malta; the units participating in Operation Husky on 10 July 1943, before 815 Squadron was disbanded. =On Fairey Barracudas= A Fairey Barracuda The squadron reformed in October 1943 at RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus) to operate Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers, operating from with the Eastern Fleet, attacking targets in Sumatra, August‚ÄìSeptember 1944.Thetford 1994, p. ?

After recruiting bassist Jasmine You, drummer Yuki and guitarist Teru, they performed their first show on June 23. Their key characteristics are their Rococo-esque costumes, dueling guitars and heavy but melodic arrangements. The group gained a significant worldwide following soon after forming as their debut EP Lyrical Sympathy (2007), released by Kamijo's own label Sherow Artist Society, received a simultaneous European release and they performed in Europe and the United States the following year. Their first full-length album, Noble released in 2008, was also released in North America in 2009. Versailles signed to major label Warner Music Japan in mid-2009, however, on August 9, days after announcing he would be suspending activities for health reasons, Jasmine You died. Their major debut album Jubilee (2010) was completed with Hizaki performing the unfinished bass tracks. They went on a world tour that took them to Latin America and Europe and ended with new bassist Masashi officially joining. 2011 began with the whole band starring in their own television show titled , that ran from January to March. Their third album Holy Grail (2011) was their highest charting, reaching number 12 on the Oricon, and was supported by their second world tour.

History=2007: Formation In March 2007, Versailles was formed by Kamijo (ex-Lareine), Hizaki (ex-Sulfuric Acid), and Jasmine You (ex-Jakura). Later, Teru (ex-Aikaryu) and Yuki (ex-Sugar Trip), who were recommended by the Rock May Kan venue in Tokyo, joined the band. Hizaki, Jasmine You and Teru previously played together as part of Hizaki Grace Project. Kamijo and Hizaki created the concept of Versailles in the autumn of 2006 and spent six months gathering members to express it. Their band concept is \\"the absolute youshikibi (beauty of form) sound and extremes of aestheticism\\". On March 30, 2007 the details of the band were announced. They released promotional material through the internet, set up an English language page on MySpace, and had several interviews with foreign press. Versailles made their first appearance with a showcase on June 23, followed by their first performance on June 24. On these dates they also distributed their first single and DVD single, \\"The Revenant Choir\\". The band signed with the German CLJ Records label and released the EP Lyrical Sympathy on October 31, both in Japan and Europe.

The family was made up of Classes 11 (12), 12 (12), 21 (60) and 27 (60). Classes 11, 12 and 21 were nearly twice as powerful as Classes 22, 23 and 25 while Class 27 was more than twice as powerful as these 1950s locomotives. This family was heavily influenced by the Class 20¬≤ from the mid-1970s. They were very reliable because of the trial and error development of their predecessor. This family came into service with M4 and M5 coaching stock and the AM 80 and AM 86 series of EMUs. This generation was a major modernization of the NMBS/SNCB even if the older M2 coaching stock remained active for more than a decade before being replaced. The only real difference between a Class 11 and a Class 21 was the Class 11 had a transformer inside to allow working under both 3000 V DC in Belgium and 1500 V DC plus Dutch signalling and train protection for working in Holland. Externally they were identical to Classes 12 and 21 aside from the livery and a few minor details. The Class 11 locomotives were built in the 1980s for hauling the Benelux trains between Brussels, Belgium, and Amsterdam, The Netherlands. They operated in the push pull mode - remotely controlled from a leading driving trailer when at the rear of the train. They were numbered 1181-1192 to avoid confusion with NS Class 1100 locos that were still in use at that time. The Dutch Class 11 was originally numbered from 1101 to 1160. In 2009 they were replaced on the Benelux trains by Bombardier TRAXX locomotives which had been leased from Angel (now Alpha) Trains. When Class 11 locomotives were replaced on international services they were moved to peak hour services within Belgium for the rest of their working lives before retirement. They are painted to match the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways) coaching stock they used to work with. Due to their limited number and intensive use at speeds up to 140 KmH (87 MPH), these locomotives aged rapidly after 25 years of service and became subject to frequent failures. Of course that led to frequent service disruptions and many passenger complaints. All Class 11s were stored inside at the d√™pot of Stockem, near Arlon, upon withdrawal late in 2012. In mid-2014, similar loco 1203 was intensively tested in the Czech Republic at Velim under 25000 volt overhead and did very well. It was then sold to open access operator XTR-System Development in the Czech Republic with an option to buy the entire class. The option was taken and the remaining Class 11 locos were transferred to their new operator early in 2016. The same operator also agreed to buy 11 ( of the SNCB 12 Class 11 locomotives at the same time but the deal never went through and the locos have been sitting outside at Stockem ever since 1187 was/is preserved by The SNCB Historical Patrimonium. As of May 2020, they are reported to have been sold, presumably for scrapping, with the exception of 1187 which is kept in a museum.https://www.hgbtf.net/viewtopic.php?f=41&t;=12408&start;=30 The class was allocated to Schaarbeek depot. On 11 August 1999, locomotive 1187 became the first of its class to work on anything other than the Benelux service that they were designed and purchased for. 1187 made a voyage from Brussels Midi to Arlon, near Luxembourg, and return for a rather strange reason. SNCB wanted to run a special train that day because of a total solar eclipse. The eclipse would be much more noticeable in the southeast of Belgium than around Brussels or anywhere else in the country. 1187 must have been the only newer loco available at Schaarbeek depot that morning or perhaps it just happened to be the only one that was parked where it wasn't necessary to move other locomotives or coaches for it to leave the depot. Either way, this should not have happened as there was an agreement between SNCB and NS that these 12 locomotives and their coaches were only to be used on the Benelux service.

Cristina Altamira Biography Born into an Argentine family of Spanish descent, Altamira trained in Buenos Aires with her father, Manuel Altamira, a well-known tenor specializing in the genres of tango and milonga. She also became conversant with Argentine folk dance and guitar playing, and was a member of various choral organizations and music groups. After a performance tour through Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, she settled in Caracas. Here she founded the vocal-instrumental ensemble Alabanza, taking much interest in the study of Venezuelan folk music, instruments, and vocal techniques. In 1977 she recorded the album Gracias together with Pedro Inatty and Dieter Lehnhoff, whom she had met in Caracas and who became her husband. After settling in Guatemala, Altamira developed an interest in Renaissance music from Europe and especially Spain, the country of her ancestors. She studied with Marina Prado Bola√±os and Manuel G√≥mez, and performed as soloist with the accompaniment of lutenist Alejandro Herrera and with the Da Camera Ensemble. After a new period in Venezuela for a series of performances, she returned to Guatemala, where she sang and acted in theatrical productions such as Sophocles' Antigona, Calder√≥n de la Barca's La vida es sue√±o (Life is a Dream), and the musical Un sue√±o hecho realidad (A Dream Come True) with the Carrusel group, winning the Opus 1983 award for the best theatre music. At the same time she began to devote herself to the project of reviving Guatemalan music from the Renaissance and baroque with the ensemble, now renamed Capella Antiqua. They were awarded the \\"15th of September\\" Central American Music Prize in 1985. For four years she resided in Washington, D.C. with her husband and their two children, Gabriela and Sebastian. Here she sang Spanish American baroque music with The New World Consort and studied voice with Raymond McGuire. Upon return to Guatemala, she founded the Millennium Ensemble together with Dieter Lehnhoff. With this new group she recorded premieres of a sizable number of villancicos, songs, and cantatas by Manuel Jos√© de Quir√≥s, Rafael Antonio Castellanos, Pedro Nolasco Estrada Aristondo, Jos√© Eulalio Samayoa, and Jos√© Escol√°stico Andrino. Further recordings included Masses, hymns, and vespers music by Hernando Franco, Pedro Berm√∫dez, and Gaspar Fern√°ndez, as well as orchestral songs by Luis Felipe Arias, Rafael Alvarez Ovalle, and Rafael Ju√°rez Castellanos. At the same time, she has cultivated European baroque and classical repertoire, performing cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach, arias by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and odes by Henry Purcell. Altamira has sung solo parts in numerous concerts in various countries with the Millennium Ensemble, as well as with the New Philharmonic Orchestra, later Metropolitan Orchestra and finally Millennium Orchestra. She has participated in festivals and concerts in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Spain, Venezuela, and the United States to great acclaim.. For her outstanding performances, she was awarded a number of prizes such as the Dante Alighieri Medal. She is also a founding member of the Guatemalan Music Council, affiliated to the International Music Council of Unesco. In 2001 Altamira commenced her radio broadcasting programme \\"Barroco de dos mundos\\" (Baroque from Two Worlds) on the Guatemalan national public Radio Faro Cultural 104.5 FM. The programme, which airs every Friday night at 8 PM for a full hour, is devoted to the dissemination of new discoveries of baroque music from the Americas and Europe, having found a wide audience and critical acclaim.

The Lexus 2054 is a concept car designed by Harald Belker for the 2002 Steven Spielberg film Minority Report. The vehicle was shown being built at an automated factory in the film, and later driven by star Tom Cruise in several action sequences. History In 2002, Lexus was requested by Steven Spielberg, a Lexus owner himself, to design a vehicle that would fit the requirements of year 2054 for his movie adaptation of the 1956 Philip K. Dick short story \\"The Minority Report\\". Designer Harald Belker worked with Calty, the Toyota/Lexus design studio in California. They came up with an advanced vehicle that would run on fuel cells and have many advanced safety features, including a crashproof structure and biometric security systems. (Lexus' cinematic concept car also appears in the 2005 film The Island, though it is colored blue, not red). A film tie-in site proposed a Lexus future vehicle that would drive itself, take dinner orders verbally, and select music to match occupant moods. The Lexus 2054 later appeared at several auto shows and public events. The site won several advertising awards. Lexus paid $5 million for the rights to market the vehicle and its brand in relation to the film. The Maisto toy company produced a 1/24 scale replica of the car that was sold exclusively at The Sharper Image to promote the film.

He played for all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, and California Angels. Frohwirth threw with a submarine delivery. Frohwirth, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin native, was a 1980 graduate of Messmer High School in Milwaukee and a 1984 graduate of Northwest Missouri State University. Major League Baseball career The Philadelphia Phillies selected Frohwirth in the 13th round (335th overall) of the 1984 Major League Baseball draft. Frohwirth began the 1987 season in Minor League Baseball (MiLB), with the Double-A Eastern League (EL) Reading Phillies and was leading the league with 16 saves when he was promoted to the Triple-A Maine Guides of the International League (IL), on June 29, 1987. On August 10, 1987, the Phillies promoted Frohwirth to the big leagues, when he made his MLB debut. Frohwirth entered the game in the fifth inning, when Phillies teammate Kevin Gross was caught with an illegal substance (sandpaper), in his glove, and was ejected. Frohwirth pitched an effective 1 innings and was awarded the win in the team's 4‚Äì2 victory. Frohwith finished the 1987 minor league season with a 1.86 earned run average (ERA) with Reading and a 2.51 ERA with Maine, finishing the season with a combined 23 saves in MiLB. He won the 1987 Paul Owens Award as the top pitcher in the Phillies‚Äô farm system. In 1988, Frohwith went back down to Maine, posting a 7‚Äì3 record, with a 2.44 ERA, and 13 saves, before returning to the Phillies, going 1‚Äì2 with an 8.25 ERA. He pitched infrequently enough to maintain his rookie status until 1989; that season, Frohwith had his breakout MLB season, as he appeared in 45 games, had a 3.59 ERA, and allowed fewer hits (56) than innings pitched. After spending most of 1990 back at Triple-A, with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, Frohwirth was given his release by the Phillies. He then signed with the Baltimore Orioles and had three solid seasons, compiling a 2.71 ERA in 186 relief outings. Frohwirth also pitched for the Boston Red Sox and California Angels, before retiring following the 1996 campaign. Later career Frohwirth had a lengthy career coaching high-school basketball in the area, once leading Whitefish Bay High School to the state final. Frohwirth was the boys' varsity basketball coach at Marquette University High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 2013‚Äì14, but the school did not renew his contract. Frohwith continued to have an affiliation with the Baltimore Orioles as a major league scout. He joined the Orioles in Sarasota at spring training in March 2014 and worked (in a coaching capacity) with Orioles submarine relief pitcher Darren O'Day. Legacy Frohwith died on March 26, 2017, from bladder cancer. His son Tyler Frohwirth was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 31st round of the 2016 baseball draft.

D607/C/151, Title: R. H. Smyth, Dunsford, near Downpatrick, Dated: 9 October 1795 Willis was born at Holyhead, Anglesey, where his father was stationed. He was a descendant of the Willises of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire- from whom descended the Willys baronets of Fen Ditton- through his grandfather, Joseph Willis of Wakefield, Yorkshire, where the family had been settled since the seventeenth century. Willis was educated at Rugby (alongside his elder brother, William Downes Willis), Charterhouse (whence he was expelled for taking a leading part in a school rebellion alongside a fellow student, Wood)Short Biographies of the Worthies of Worcestershire, ed.

R. Pheney, Inner Temple Lane, 1816, title pageThe Solicitors' Journal and Reporter, Vol. 21, 1877, p. 874 and practised as a chancery barrister. In 1820-1 he published his Pleadings in Equity, and in 1827 A Practical Treatise on the Duties and Responsibilities of Trustees. In 1823, the Earl of Strathmore applied to Willis for legal advice; while a frequent guest in the Earl's household, Willis met his daughter, Lady Mary Isabella. They married the following year, and settled with Willis's widowed mother and his sister at Hendon. Their son, Robert Bruce Willis, was born in 1826.  Upper Canada and British Guiana  In 1827, with his father- in-law's endorsement, Willis was appointed a puisne judge of the Court of King's bench in Upper Canada, with the expectation being that a Court of Chancery would be established shortly after at which he would be the judge.'A new miscellany-at-law: yet another diversion for lawyers and others', Sir Robert Edgar Megarry, Bryan A. Garner, 2005 Willis and his family arrived in Canada on 17 September. Although at first he and his wife were welcomed into the social and legal life of the colony, within a few months Willis fell foul of the attorney-general, John Beverley Robinson, a very experienced official, and took the most unusual course of stating in court that Robinson had neglected his duty and that he would feel it necessary \\"to make a representation on the subject to his majesty's government\\". Willis had a low opinion of Robinson, having previously observed \\"that any proposition that did not originate with himself was not generally attended with his approbation\\".'The story of the Upper Canadian Rebellion', John Charles Dent, 1885 Willis allied himself with a group of lawyers who were chief opposition spokesmen: John Rolph, William Warren Baldwin and his son Robert, and Marshall Spring Bidwell. Another friend was the novelist- at that time Secretary of the Canada Company- John Galt. Willis also took a strong stand on the question of the legality of the court as then constituted, and this led in June 1828 to his being removed from his position by the lieutenant-governor, Sir Peregrine Maitland, with whose wife, Lady Sarah, Willis's wife had had a disagreement regarding precedence. Willis returned to England in July with his mother (during which time they also stayed at Tyrella House, Dundrum Bay, County Down, the home of his mother's cousin, Rev. George Hamilton, father of the politician George Alexander Hamilton),I Like a Clamour, Max Bonnell, Federation Press, 2017, pp. 5, 54, 92Judge John Walpole Willis and Lady Mary Willis: The Canadian experience & its aftermath, J. C. Foweraker, 2009 leaving his sister, wife and son behind in the care of his friends. This separation led to the dissolution of his marriage; his wife, in May 1829, leaving her son with a maid and absconding with an infantry lieutenant. The question was referred to the Privy Council which ruled against Willis. His conduct was treated as an error of judgment and he was given another appointment as a judge in Demerara, British Guiana, appointed Vice-President of the Court of Civil and Criminal Justice. He served as first puisne judge, i.e. second in rank after the Chief Justice, Charles Wray. At first, Willis seemed well- suited to Guiana; he avoided becoming embroiled in local politics, and enjoyed close and cordial relations with a number of the colony's influential people. Following the emancipation of slaves there, many former slave owners continued to whip their former slaves; when tried for such offences, these former slave owners were recommended for acquittal by the Assessors who sat with the Supreme Court- these Assessors themselves being former slave owners. Willis however held the former masters guilty, and this caused ill feeling against him. In the case of Damon, a chief leader of an uprising of former slaves, all members of the Court save Willis- influenced by English law, which penalised such acts with imprisonment, rather than the Roman-Dutch law prevalent at British Guiana- pronounced the sentence of death; Damon was hanged. The strong protests Willis made on this matter are thought to have adversely impacted his health.Short Biographies of the Worthies of Worcestershire, ed. Edith O. Browne and Rev. John R. Burton, E. G. Humphreys (Worcester) and Wilson & Phillips (Hereford), 1916, p. 177 In 1835 he was passed over for promotion to Chief Justice there in favour of Jeffery Hart Bent, formerly the Chief Justice of St Lucia, and a similarly divisive figure, despite Willis having served as first puisne judge under the previous Chief Justice, Charles Wray, and having been acting chief justice on Wray's retirement; within three months, embittered by this and experiencing chronic liver trouble (likely malarial, or related to amoebic dysentery), he returned to England on sick leave. During this period, he married Ann Susanna Kent Bund, daughter and heir of Col. Thomas Henry Bund, of Wick House, Worcestershire. When Willis was due to return, he was, at the insistence of the Governor of British Guiana, instead persuaded by the Colonial Office to take a posting in Sydney as a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. New South Wales and Port Phillip On 3 November 1837 he arrived in Sydney with his new wife. Initially Willis was on good terms with Sir James Dowling (who a few months later became chief justice), but in 1839 differences arose, and on one occasion Willis in open court made observations which were taken as a reflection on the chief justice. He also brought forward the question whether the chief justice had forfeited his office by acting as judge of the admiralty court. Matters came to such a pass that in March 1840 the governor, Sir George Gipps, arranged that Willis should be appointed resident judge at Port Phillip, Melbourne. Arriving in Melbourne with 43 tonnes of luggage, he soon came in conflict with the press, the legal fraternity, and members of the public. In October 1842 Gipps stated in a dispatch that: In February 1843 Gipps recommended to Lord Stanley that Willis should be removed from his position.Historical Records of Australia, ser. I, vol. XXII, p. 551. On 26 June 1843 Gipps summarily removed Willis, becoming the second Australian judge to be removed from office. [2013] 12 Macquarie Law Journal 21. Willis left Melbourne for London in July 1843 and appealed to the Privy Council. (1972) 8(4) Melbourne University Law Review 703. In August 1846 the Privy Council held that while there were sufficient grounds for Willis' removal, he should have been given an opportunity to be heard and he was awarded the arrears of his salary to that date. Willis then offered his resignation, but this was not accepted and his commission was revoked. This course was taken because otherwise it might not have been understood that the order was reversed not as being \\"unjust in itself, but only as having been made in an improper manner\\"Historical Records of Australia, ser. I, vol. XXV, p. 208. Willis was never given any other position. Late life In 1850 Willis published a volume On the Government of the British Colonies (noted in The Athenaeum magazine as 'not unworthy of the attention of those who are seeking... a way out of our present colonial difficulties'),The Athenaeum, no 1198, pg 1069 and afterwards lived in retirement at Wick Episcopi, Worcestershire, serving as a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for the county. He died on 10 September 1877, survived by the son of his first marriage, and by a son John William Willis- Bund and two daughters by the second marriage. Amongst his descendants were Francis MacCarthy Willis Bund, an Anglican clergyman and Chaplain of Balliol College, Oxford, Frederick Smythe Willis, the sometime mayor of Willoughby, New South Wales and founder member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia, and Leslie R. H. Willis, engineer and archaeologist. Character Despite his considerable ability, Willis was noted to have a naturally rather difficult temperament, which was not improved by his clashes with colleagues over what he perceived as their lax moral standards. The novelist Rolf Boldrewood, Willis's neighbour while posted in Sydney, described his 'genial and gracious' personality while shooting, which when in court became \\"impatience of contradiction... acerbity of manner, and... infirmity of temper\\" \\"painful to witness and dangerous to encounter\\".'Redmond Barry: an Anglo-Irish Australian', Ann Galbally, 1995 The Melbourne journalist and author Garryowen recorded: \\"Such was his irascibility and so often was the Court the arena of unseemly squabbles that people who had no business there attended to see 'the fun', for, as there was no theatre in town, Judge Willis was reckoned to be 'as good as a play'\\". Nonetheless, he was known for his brilliance and wit, as well as \\"a humaneness that was unfashionable, even unsavoury, for the times\\", as shown by his provision- at his own expense- of roast beef and plum pudding to all the prisoners in Melbourne jail on New Year's Day 1842. This enlightened attitude extended to his treatment of the black populations of British Guiana and Australia with whom he dealt; in the case of the former, Willis held former slave masters to account for their mistreatment of their former slaves rather than- as strongly pressured by his fellows- allowing them to get away with assaulting them, and fought for imprisonment, rather than the death penalty, for the leader of an uprising of former slaves. In Australia, Willis addressed jurors with a warning against prejudice during the trial of Aboriginal Australians for murder, and in the case of R v Bonjon, went as far as stating his doubts regarding the right of colonial administrators to interfere with the customs of the Aboriginal people; recognising the existence of their own legal system, he concluded that treaties ought to be made with them. Noting the decline in Aboriginal population around the colonial settlements, Willis questioned why, if they were to be considered British subjects, no efforts appeared to have been made by the Executive Government or the judiciary to protect and support them, citing exploitation of the Aboriginal people as in Batman's Treaty.R v Bonjon [1841 NSWSupC 92], Supreme Court of NSW (District of Port Phillip). Bruce Kercher considers that Willis 'was the most important legal official in colonial Australia who took seriously the idea that Aborigines had their own laws and customs.'Kercher, Bruce (1995). An unruly child: a history of law in Australia. St Leonards: Allen & Unwin. . Despite a \\"haughty and imperious\\" 'The Canada Company and the Huron Tract, 1826‚Äì1853', Robert Charles Lee, 2004 manner, Willis was nonetheless popular with the public, receiving strong support from certain quarters. He was regarded as \\"a martyr to his upright and liberal principles\\"; his amoval \\"tended greatly to embitter public opinion, and was unquestionably a strong factor in producing the discontent which ultimately found expression in open rebellion\\". Henry James Morgan, author of 'Sketches of celebrated Canadians and persons connected with Canada' considered that Willis \\"received such base and unprincipled treatment at [the hands of those in power] for no reason but because he did his duty well, was an English lawyer of great legal ability and knowledge; and also a gentleman of much goodness and amiability of character... he displayed great judgement, and an accurate acquaintance with his official duties, and was considered an honour to the bench (heretofore not in very high repute) not only for his talents and merits as a lawyer, but for his very excellent disposition, and for the manner in which he maintained the dignity and impartiality of the court... such a man was not in favour with the omnipotent power that ruled the upper province; and a strong dislike was taken against him.\\"'Sketches of celebrated Canadians and persons connected with Canada', Henry James Morgan, 1862 George Wright, in \\"Wattle blossoms: some of the grave and gay reminiscences of an old colonist\\" characterised Willis in his time in Australia as \\"one of those noble souled men who feared nothing so much as an accusing conscience, and therefore dared on all occasions to speak truth for truth's sake\\".'Wattle blossoms: some of the grave and gay reminiscences of an old colonist', George Wright, 1857 John Charles Dent, in 'The Canadian Portrait Gallery volume I', considered Willis \\"a gentleman of spotless character, kind and amiable manners, and wide and various learning. He was beyond comparison the ablest jurist who, up to that point, had sat on the judicial bench\\".'The Canadian Portrait Gallery volume I', John Charles Dent, 1841 Notes References  Additional resources listed by the Australian Dictionary of Biography: *Historical Records of Australia, series I, vols 19‚Äì22 *E.

Boston opened a brewery in 1796 making a form of corn beer. Early life=Australia bound As a young man Boston hovered on the outskirts of the Birmingham circle of radicals and, like Joseph Priestley, became a staunch republican. Perhaps because of his political opinions he decided to leave 'reactionary England' in 1793, and in December recommended himself to the Colonial Office as a trained surgeon and apothecary, versed in the arts of brewing and with 'theoretical and some practical knowledge of agriculture'. The secretary of state agreed to his going, hoped he would prove useful, and urged Governor John Hunter to keep him. He sailed with his wife and three children in the Surprize which left Spithead (1794 May 2) going via Rio de Janeiro to Sydney (1794 Oct 25).http://www.blaxland.com/ozships/year/arrive/1794/8.htm Convictions (Australian shipping 1788‚Äì1968) Having been sent out by government to supply the colony with salted fish, Boston had at some time offered to procure and salt fish for the settlement; but he required boats and men, and more assistance than it was possible to supply.

Amongst other useful knowledge Boston professed to possess, he offered his skills at making salt from seawater. As it was much wanted, his offers were accepted and an eligible spot at Bennelong's Point (as the east point of the cove had long been named) had been chosen. He began his operations, for which he had seven convicts assigned to him, whose labour, however, only produced three or four bushels of salt in more than as many weeks. Brewing In 1796, with the aid of an encyclopedia, Boston produced the first fermented alcohol beverage made at Sydney, which sold for 1s 6d (1 shilling, 6 pence). The corn beer, being made by Boston, was brewed from properly malted maize and bittered with the leaves and stalks of the love apple, (Lycopersicum, a species of Solanum), or as it was more commonly called in the settlement, the Cape gooseberry. Boston found this succeeded so well, that he erected at some expense a building for the business and was, engaged in brewing and making soap.

Life and career Born Eva Hermine von Sacher-Masoch, Freiin Erisso, she was the grand-niece of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, author of Venus in Furs, and was the mother of Marianne Faithfull.

As a young woman she moved to Berlin where she worked as a ballerina for the Max Reinhardt Company, and danced for productions of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. At the outbreak of World War II, Sacher-Masoch returned to her parents' home in Vienna and lived there for the duration of the war. Despite their Jewish ancestry, Sacher- Masoch and her mother were afforded a degree of protection from the Nazis due to Artur's World War I military record and his status as a well-regarded Austrian writer (under the pseudonym Michael Zorn). Having opposed Hitler since the Anschluss, and witnessing atrocities against Jews in the streets of Vienna, Sacher-Masoch and her parents used their home to conceal Socialist pamphlets, narrowly evading detection by the Gestapo. Sacher-Masoch witnessed the United States Army Air Forces daylight raids on Vienna from 1944 onwards, and the Red Army's assault on Vienna in 1945.

C. ‚ÄòThe Scarlet Gown: History and Development of Scottish Undergraduate Dress‚Äô, Transactions of the Burgon Society, 10 (2010), pp. 8-42. (Available here) The most famous form of Scottish undergraduate dress is the red or scarlet gown. It is differentiated slightly according to the university at which it is worn. These gowns are worn by students of the University of St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dundee. The University of Strathclyde did not adopt the red gown, and instead students use the black supertunica, adorned with saltire blue buttons and cords.Seen on Page 32 in: Cooper, J. C. ‚ÄòThe Scarlet Gown: History and Development of Scottish Undergraduate Dress‚Äô, Transactions of the Burgon Society, 10 (2010), p. 32. (Available here) History It is likely that pre-Reformation undergraduates would have worn a black supertunica in common with students at all European universities of the time. By the latter part of James VI's reign, this had formalised into scarlet. Traditionally, the red colour was symbolic of a lower status, and was particularly visible. The post-Reformation gown evolved as a uniform for students, its visibility preventing them from engaging in illicit activities in their university towns. In his work, A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, Daniel Defoe notes the presence of the gowns at the Universities of Glasgow and St Andrews in the early 18th century, but also their absence at Edinburgh. In reference to the University of Glasgow: In reference to the University of St Andrews: The \\"toga rubra\\" name, mainly popular at Aberdeen, was also used more widely, and declined with educational reform. A significant example of this is the actions of John Anderson, a professor at the University of Glasgow and founder of what went on to become the University of Strathclyde. During his tenure he opened up lectures specifically to cater to the working population of Glasgow, and in order to make their attendance more straightforward certain formalities, such as the red gown, were dispensed with - a move which was looked upon unfavourably by university authorities. As such, these became known as his \\"Anti-toga classes\\". (viewable online here) University of Glasgow The University of Glasgow's undergraduate gown is as follows: \\"Scarlet cloth, with full sleeves half the length of the gown. A difference indicating the Faculty may be worn in the form of a narrow band of silk on the breast of each side of the gown of the colour of the hood-lining proper to the lowest degree in the Faculty\\". University of Aberdeen thumb At the University of Aberdeen, and particularly within the predecessor King's College, the gown (or toga rubra) has had varied fortunes over the years. During one of the slumps in use in 1885, it was noted that less than one-quarter of students wore it and was largely restricted to arts students at King's College. Regulations existed compelling gown-wearing amongst students, although were rarely enforced. In 1888, a plebcite was organised at King's by the Students' Representative Council, which continued to support compulsion by 258 votes to 32, and was recognised by the University's Senate.R.D. Anderson, The Student Community at Aberdeen 1860-1939(Aberdeen University Press, 1988), pp.47-48 This was to little avail, with the gown still not becoming universal as it had been previously, and remaining subject to fashion. In the 1850s, Sir George Reid painted an image of an Aberdeen student in the gown, entitled \\"Salve Toga Rubra\\".http://www.abdn.ac.uk/virtualmuseum/pictures_show2.php?prefix=ABDUA#=30706&firstview;=true&mt;=not&sign;=&viewnumber;=&resultsperpage;=18&termscount;=1&listofterms;[0]= The toga was criticised as being unsuited to the climate of Aberdeen. It was considered proper amongst students to wear an old and worn gown. A tradition of 'gown-tearing' by older students to new 'bajans' (first years) therefore developed.R.D. Anderson, op. cit., p.13 Matriculation at Aberdeen traditionally occurred on the first Sunday of term; out of enforced respect for Sabbath, students would wait until the following Monday to engage in a 'tearing day'., pp. 149-150 Despite the cost of gowns, attempts to outlaw this practice were difficult to enforce, particularly as all students of the era carried a penknife in order to mend quills., p. 147 Opposition to the gown was also evident, during a 1922 attempt to build 'Varsity Spirit' and restore to wide use the 'traditional and honoured dress' of students, an anti-gown group was formed to protest at its restoration to prominence. In 1924, their views were aired in the university newspaper, stating: This element of separation often caused gowned students to be jeered by the local children of the city. Use The undergraduate gown has lost popularity at different times in the different universities. The requirements of town residence made it impractical, however the more isolated locations of Aberdeen and St Andrews (and by extension, Dundee) ensured a longer heritage. At present, the gowns are most commonly a feature associated with the University of St Andrews where they are very commonly worn by students to formal events, pier walks and exams. They are only very rarely found in everyday usage at the other institutions, although are still occasionally seen worn by debaters, societies, student representatives, choirs and attendees at formal events and chapel services. It is perhaps most commonly seen at academic ceremonies, particularly in relation to the installation of a new Rector. The undergraduate style influences several gowns of office, particularly for members of Students' Representative Councils and Rectors. Appearance University of St Andrews gown on a hanger, obverse and reverse shown Colour The colour of the red undergraduate gown is rarely defined precisely, however the University of Dundee and the University of St Andrews set the correct colour as \\"Union Jack red\\" (BCC210). Differencing There are several differences between the gowns at the various universities, including: * Aberdeen - The gown is shorter than others and is often referred to as a \\"toga rubra\\" or simply a toga. The gown was captured in the painting Salve Toga Rubra () by Sir George Reid, viewable here;http://www.abdn.ac.uk/virtualmuseum/pictures_show2.php?prefix=ABDUA#=31254&firstview;=true&mt;=not&sign;=&viewnumber;=&resultsperpage;=27&termscount;=1&listofterms; it is an amalgamation of the gowns of King's College, Aberdeen and Marischal College, the Aberdeen University Review stating that the velvet collar is associated with Marischal and the arms associated with the King's gown. * Dundee - The student gown is described in the University Handbook as '\\"A gown of nap material in Union Jack red (BCC210) with cape sleeves and with a yoke and collar and abbreviated square patch facings in serge or flannel of Stewart blue.\\"' * Edinburgh - The gown is entirely scarlet. * Glasgow - Permits a \\"narrow band of silk on the breast of each side of the gown of the colour of the hood-lining proper to the lowest degree in the Faculty\\" to adorn the gown. * St Andrews - the gown has a maroon yoke and collar. :The various colleges of St Andrews wear differing gowns; the distinction between United College and Queen's College existed even before the latter became independent as the University of Dundee. Today, the students of St Mary's College(the Faculty of Divinity) wear a simple black gown with a violet/purple St Andrews cross on the left breast. Post-graduates in St Mary's College wear the graduate gown with the violet/purple saltire cross in the left facing. The members of the non-statutory St Leonard's College are not entitled to wear the red gown as the college has no undergraduates amongst its number. They wear the graduate gown of their earlier degree (if that institution has academic dress), or the black gown with burgundy facings of St Leonard's College which was introduced in recent years for such post-graduates. * Strathclyde - Strathclyders instead use the pre-Reformation black supertunica. The supertunica may be worn casually or formally, but it is never compulsory for lectures, as a testament to John Anderson's objections. The gown is similar to that MA gown used at Oxford university, except the cords and buttons on the sleeve and around the yoke are in Saltire Blue. This is a tradition which is unique to Strathclyde. Specialist gowns=Gowns of office Many universities also have gowns of office for their student representatives. These are often variants inspired by the red gown, often differenced by facings. The Glasgow University Students' Representative Council executive uses wholly purple gowns. Full listings of gowns worn by the University of St Andrews Students' Association are available at the Academic dress of the University of St Andrews entry. The University of Strathclyde Students' Association executive use the black supertunica with the university logo embroidered on the front at each side. The President also enjoys gold embroidery on the sleeves. Other undergraduate gowns * St Mary's College at the University of St Andrews, that is to say the New College of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, (in effect, the faculty of divinity) uses plain black gowns for its undergraduates. The gown is described as being made of black stuff, knee length with short open sleeves and with a violet cross of St Andrew on the left facing. The colour of the cross corresponds to the material used for hoods in the Faculty of Divinity. Black lined with violet (MTheol) and Violet with the cowl and apron edged with white fur (BD). The reason for this gown being black, despite being an undergraduate gown is that in times gone by all members of St Mary's College were graduates and so despite the fact that this is no longer the case, the black gown has been preserved. As noted above post- graduates in St Mary's College wear the graduate gown with the violet/purple saltire cross in the left facing.

The tool is used by the World Bank and partner governments to measure and evaluate critical governance challenges within the public sector., The diagnostic tool aims to address two of the fundamental challenges policy makers face when trying to curb corruption and improve governance: (i) to obtain the most relevant type of information to identify priorities for reform; and (ii) to create the conditions for sustaining the reform process over time. The results of the surveys allows countries to unbundle corruption (administrative, state capture, bidding, theft of public resources, purchase of licenses); identify weak and strong institutions; assess the costs of corruption to different stakeholders; and identify concrete and measurable ways to reduce those costs. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of public services by improving governance in personnel and resource management, access to services and citizen feedback mechanisms by feeding into participatory and targeted reform planning.Recanatini (2011), ‚ÄúCountry- specific diagnostic assessments: an alternative approach for policy reform‚Äù, As of 2013, 23 countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa have implemented the surveys. The Diagnostic Approach and Process The Governance and Anti-Corruption Country Diagnostic Surveys are built on partnership between multiple actors and the active involvement of the government, civil society and business representatives at different stages of the implementation process. During the data gathering process local NGOs and specialists are employed to allow for capitalization on, and strengthening of, local knowledge and expertise. Two types Diagnostics have been developed: (i) General Governance and Anti-corruption Diagnostics, which require a broad approach to assessing the governance and anti-corruption situation in a country and (ii) Sectoral Governance and Anti-Corruption Diagnostics, which assess a particular sector within the broader GAC context. While the first approach is the one which has been most frequently used, the second approach is suitable for countries facing unique challenges that require more in-depth and narrowly defined data or countries who are keen to draft a governance reform that focuses only on a few sectors, rather than on the whole public administration. This alternative approach has so far been used in Haiti, Madagascar, Mauritania, Senegal, Morocco and Yemen.World Bank Governance and Anti-corruption (GAC) Diagnostic Surveys: The process, The survey process is tailored to each country to address individual governance context and priorities. However, in most of the countries undertaking this type of work, the project components include: * A preparatory phase (Phase 0) to identify and recruit the project team and develop a detailed work program. * A ‚Äúpartnership-promoting‚Äù phase (Phase 1) to facilitate the coordination of the different national stakeholders involved in the process. * A development phase (Phase 2) to assess potential institutional weaknesses, to design and revise diagnostic tools, and (iii) to train staff to carry out the required field work. * A fieldwork phase (Phase 3) to collect the governance data, using the tools developed in Phase 2. This Phase will include sample design, fieldwork as well as data coding, and will be carried out jointly by local and external experts. * An analytical and action planning phase (Phase 4), to analyze the data collected in Phase 3 and design a specific action plan to improve governance. The analysis, carried out jointly by the Bank team and local team, led to the completion of a policy report to address questions such as: What is the cost of mis-governance to firms, users, and public finances? What are its consequences? How does mis-governance affect poor users and small firms? What effect does mis-governance have in public service delivery? What are the causes of institutional vulnerability? What are the fundamental issues on which a reform program designed to improve governance and reduce mismanagement should to focus? The policy report is then used by the country to design a specific action plan for governance improvement * A dissemination phase (Phase 5), to disseminate the results of the analysis completed in Phase 4 to local and central governments, citizens, media and research agencies. Where feasible, the development of internet sites for further data access and dissemination will be promoted and a series of training activities will be organized on the use of the data for policy making and monitoring. Outcomes This approach has empowered governments to develop their own governance and anti-corruption strategies based on more objective, micro-level data and a participatory model. The data collected have also allowed practitioners to go beyond a generic concept of corruption by unbundling different types of corruption and identifying more appropriate policy measures. While in many cases it is premature to evaluate the impact of this alternative approach, some interesting by-products have already emerged. A few countries (Paraguay and Mozambique) have mobilized resources and used on their own the same approach for a second round of assessment. In a couple of cases the country has chosen to institutionalize part of this assessment integrating it in their regular data collection implemented by the National Statistical Agency. Finally, the newly available data has allowed researchers to further our understanding of the link between institutional factors and different types of corruption, and of the impact of poor governance and corruption on citizens.

The park is named after the Latin American Liberator Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. The park is located in the locality of Teusaquillo and is managed by the District Institute of Recreation and Sport (Instituto Distrital de Recreacion y Deporte - IDRD). The park is one of the most popular urban parks in the city of Bogot√°. The park features a lake in which people can rent paddle boats and a large space for concerts and events capable of holding 140.000 people. History Temple created for the Eucharistic Congress that took place at the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Park The construction of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Park started in 1966. In 1968 the city of Bogot√° built a temple to commemorate the 39th International Eucharistic Congress to which the pope Paul VI was a part of. This temple was named Eucharistic Temple. At the time the lake already existed as a natural feature. In 1986 a second temple was built for the reception of Pope John Paul II. The park was officially named under the Law 31 of 1979 in commemoration of the bicentennial of the birth of Latin American leader Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Colombian architect Arturo Robledo Ocampo designed in 1982 the details of new improvements to the park which at the time was far from an actual recreational space. Ocampo developed the plans for tree growing areas, the central plaza and also designed the water supply and structures such as channels and walls. In 1983 the Events Plaza was finally built. 3300 trees were planted and a pedestrian bridge that linked the park with the Children's Museum was inaugurated. In 1995 the pedestrian pathways were made bigger from 5 meters to 10 meters wide. The stage area of the Events Plaza was closed in the perimeters and the illumination was improved. Three new access points were added. Since 1996 new social programs have been created in order to make the park an events center. This include as of now the Summer Festival, and the Rock to the park festival making it the axis of recreational activities for the city. Parks System The Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Park is in fact a system of adjacent greenspaces. Its extension is over , bigger than the Central Park extension in New York.

He also inherited the Nuttall baronetcy on his father's death in 1941, when he was eight years old. After a career in the British Army, he sold the family company in 1978 and emigrated to the Bahamas, where he became involved in marine conservation. Background Nuttall was born in Leicestershire, the son of Sir Keith Nuttall, 2nd Baronet (1901‚Äì1941), who ran the family engineering business, Edmund Nuttall, Sons & Co. Ltd, in the 1920s and 1930s. The business had been founded by Nuttall's great-grandfather James Nuttall in Manchester in 1865, and built into a nationwide business by Nuttall's grandfather, Sir Edmund Nuttall, 1st Baronet (1870‚Äì1923), who became a baronet in 1922. Nuttall's father became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Engineers in the Second World War.http://www.cwgc.org/find-war- dead/casualty/2719275 Wounded in the retreat to Dunkirk, Sir Keith died on 31 August 1941; his eight-year-old son, Nicholas, inherited the title, the family company, and the family seat at Lowesby Hall near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. His mother remarried, becoming Mrs Edward Kirkpatrick. Career Sir Nicholas was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst, and took a commission in the Royal Horse Guards in 1953. He played polo, and was an amateur jockey. On his own horse, Stalbridge Park, he won the Grand Military Gold Cup at Sandown Park in 1958, came second in 1959, then third in 1960, won again in 1961, and came second another time in 1962. He served in Cyprus during the Cyprus Emergency. By 1966, he was a major, in command of the Guards Independent Parachute Regiment. He resigned his commission in 1968, on the death of his mother, to take over the family firm. He held a party at Lowesby Hall in 1959, to celebrate the restoration of a painted ceiling by Antonio Verrio, and held a dance in tents at Lowesby in 1976, shortly before it was sold, emulating a party held by the Shah of Iran in the desert in 1972. Nuttall supported the Labour government's Channel Tunnel project in the 1970s. The company was later involved in the construction of High Speed 1. The company was bought by Hollandsche Beton Groep (later HBG), a Dutch group, in 1978, and he emigrated shortly afterwards with his third wife, Miranda, moving to Lyford Cay, near Nassau, Bahamas, on New Providence there, although he kept a house in Chelsea. He became involved in marine conservation and founded the Bahamas Reef Environmental Educational Foundation (BREEF), almost single- handedly transforming local attitudes to maritime conservation. The Nassau Guardian lauded him after his death as a \\"prominent local environmentalist... at the forefront of a number of important marine conservation initiatives and environmental causes\\".

They are bivalves which live in freshwater, as opposed to saltwater, the main habitat type for bivalves. The majority of species of bivalve molluscs live in the sea, but in addition, a number of different families live in freshwater (and in some cases also in brackish water). These families belong to two different evolutionary lineages (freshwater mussels and freshwater clams), and the two groups are not closely related. Freshwater bivalves live in many types of habitat, ranging from small ditches and ponds, to lakes, canals, rivers, and swamps. Species in the two groups vary greatly in size. Some of the pea clams (Pisidium species) have an adult size of only 3 mm. In contrast, one of the largest species of freshwater bivalves is the swan mussel, in the family Unionidae; it can grow to a length of 20 cm, and usually lives in lakes or slow rivers. Freshwater pearl mussels are economically important as a source of freshwater pearls and mother of pearl. Taxonomy Order Unionida The Unionida, of worldwide distribution, are the pearly freshwater mussels. All reproduce by means of a larval stage that is parasitic on a fish or salamander.

The titular character is an undead vigilante brought back to life by a supernatural crow to avenge his murder and death of his fianc√©e. The character has subsequently appeared in several feature films, a television series, and spin-off novels and comics. In the various incarnations, films, and spin-offs, many people have taken on the Crow persona in order to avenge their own wrongful deaths. In 2011, IGN ranked the Crow 37th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes. The Crow made his live-action debut in the 1994 The Crow portrayed by Brandon Lee. Later, The Crow was portrayed by Mark Dacascos in the 1998 television series The Crow: Stairway to Heaven. The Crow (bird) The Crow is a supernatural bird that serves as the protagonist's link between the living world and the realm of beyond. The magical crow is capable of resurrecting people who have been murdered, so that the victims may be able to seek justice on the person or people responsible for their death. This story is said to come from an old Native American legend. During the person's \\"rebirth\\", the crow serves as a guide, helping the individual tap into his or her potential and assisting in tracking down the wrongdoers. Other people do not see the crow, only the reborn, unless he wants it. The Crow speaks to the reborn, often helping guide them to exact their revenge. In the film adaptations, the crow is a real bird and if harmed or killed, the reborn becomes vulnerable. However, the Crow also seems to be much more enduring than a regular bird and might possess some regeneration abilities (e.g. in The Crow movie the bird survives after being shot with a rifle).  Powers and abilities  While they are in possession of the Crow's powers, the reborn are endowed with several unique abilities. As they are already dead, the reborn are incapable of feeling pain or fatigue and possess a supernatural ability to recover from seemingly all injuries in a matter of moments. Chief among their physical abilities is their inhuman strength and enhanced reflexes; able to quickly brutalize several opponents simultaneously, even those who would be otherwise untouchable, as well as catch fast-moving projectiles such as throwing knives with their bare hands. In both Wicked Prayer and Stairway to Heaven, the source of the reborn's strength is attributed to their love for the ones they've lost. Alternatively, Ashe Corvin says in City of Angels that the fuel for his power is pain. In either case, the Crow's magic is rooted in lost love. Also, again in the movies, the reborn possesses the ability to see images from his or her loved one's memory when touching things he or she touched before, or to see the memories of a person when touching them. In addition the reborn usually can send the images and feelings from the memories already absorbed to the person whose eyes the reborn touches at the moment; in The Crow, protagonist Eric Draven makes villain Top Dollar feel 30 hours of his (Eric's) murdered girlfriend Shelly's pain in one moment. In The Crow: Stairway to Heaven, Eric can see events that transpired simply by touching objects that belonged to someone. Although the person brought back to life by the Crow is physically invulnerable, in the movies and later Crow comics they do have one weakness: they lose their power if the crow is harmed or killed. In addition, the reborn lose their invincibility when they consider their mission completed; in The Crow: Salvation, protagonist Alex Corvis is tricked into thinking that he completed his mission, thus he becomes vulnerable. However, his guide Crow makes Alex realize his mistake and rise again. In the comic book The Crow: Waking Nightmares, it is stated that the Crow power is taken from the reborn if they abandon their mission. In case of losing special powers the reborn become vulnerable, starts to rot, and rigor mortis sets in, as if the reborn were still in their graves. In The Crow: City of Angels and The Crow: Salvation, those resurrected by the Crow have the ability to turn into crows themselves and possess the natural abilities of a crow, such as flight and night vision. Appearance In the comic book, the origin of Eric's make-up is explained briefly as \\"painting his face in the colors of joy\\". This indicates that he copied the Greek comedy masquerade mask in his and Shelly's house. Contrary to the movie, in the book Eric does not paint his face with white. The white pale color comes from the fact that Eric is dead, it's just a corpse inhibited by a soul. Joshua and Mark Leung do not wear any distinctive make-up, and Ashe's is provided by Sarah, as in the movie. Iris Shaw paints the semblance of a Crow on her face with the tail covering her nose, and the wings covering her eyes. She removes it to face her final killer. Michael Korby's makeup covers his neck and shoulders. The makeup is referred as \\"the mask of death\\" and \\"the trails of Gorgon's blood\\" in The Crow: Wild Justice comic book. In The Crow: Death and Rebirth, Jamie Osterberg's pale skin color and eye/mouth lines are not created by make-up, however, and his hair has turned completely white. In The Crow: Curare, Carrie's pale skin color is not accomplished by make-up, there is no horizontal line over the mouth, and the vertical lines over the eyes are shorter and thinner. According to O'Barr, Eric Draven is based on the face of Peter Murphy (of Bauhaus) and the body of Iggy Pop. In all feature films, except The Crow: Salvation, the protagonist wears make- up that cover their face. In the first movie Eric Draven copies the pattern from one of the masquerade that decorated his and Shelly's apartment, which consists of white paint placed over the face with black paint around eyes, black vertical lines over and under eyes, black paint on the lips and a black horizontal line across the mouth and cheeks, resembling a Glasgow smile. In The Crow: City of Angels Ashe's make-up was provided by Sarah and looks similar. Jimmy's make-up in The Crow: Wicked Prayer is similar as well, though there is no horizontal line over the mouth and the vertical eye lines are shorter and thinner. In the third movie, The Crow: Salvation, Alex Corvis is executed in the electric chair, and his face is burned by the metal helmet which was worn over his head during the execution. He removes the burned skin following his resurrection, scarring his face around the eyes and lips, thus forming a pattern similar to the classical make-up. However, there are two vertical lines over each of his eyes and they cross with the horizontal lines on his mouth. In The Crow: Stairway to Heaven TV series, Eric's \\"make-up\\" appears automatically whenever he \\"changes\\" into The Crow. His fingernails become black, while his face becomes white, with vertical lines over the eyes and short horizontal/diagonal lines extending from his lips, like a smile; they disappear when he becomes 'normal'. Even though not all the reborn wear make-up, they are still usually drawn in a certain style: their lips are usually distinctively black, skin around eyes is black, while the eyes are sometimes burning white. Generally the style of drawing reminds the pattern of the classical makeup. The resurrected souls in the Crow novels do not wear the traditional face paint/markings. Fictional character biographies=ComicsEric= The protagonist of the original comic book. Eric and his fianc√©e, Shelly, are on their way back from a romantic get-away, when their vehicle breaks down on a deserted road. A car full of gang members stops, not to help, but to take advantage of the couple's misfortune. They shoot Eric in the head paralysing him while they rape and kill his fianc√©e in the car, Eric dying hours later in the hospital. A year later, resurrected by The Crow, Eric exacts vengeance on the men responsible for their deaths. Following the original series, London Night Studios published the six-issue series The Crow/Razor: Kill the Pain (#1-4, #0 and a Finale issue) in 1998, which saw Eric paired with Everette Hartsoe's character, Razor. In it Eric is again returned to the land of the living, this time to help Razor fight a demonic gang known as Pain. In the end Eric must face the events which led to his death, and the realization that why the reason his soul cannot rest is because he blames himself for being unable to save Shelly. A follow-up magazine entitled The Crow/Razor: Nocturnal Masque, featuring artwork of both characters with quotes attributed to each, was also published. Eric was also in a 10 issue series by Image Comics which reimagined the plot, adding influences from the film. Eric and Shelly's lives are cut short when a wrong apartment number leads a gang of drug lords to mistakenly murder them only days before their wedding. Now, Eric haunts the city as the Crow, a shadow administering revenge for not only his loss, but for others as well. A police officer enlists the aid of the Crow to uncover the truth about the jailed suspect of a murdered 9-year-old girl. As the Crow is flushing out information about the murder, he discovers that Shelly's grave has been desecrated and her body has been removed. Another vigilante, a Native American named Walker, who communicates with a wolf, begins killing local murderers. =Joshua Zane= Joshua appears in the three issue series The Crow: Dead Time, the follow-up to the original graphic novel. Joshua is a Native American farmer of the Crow Nation who adopts the \\"white man's way\\" and becomes a farmer. Joshua, along with his wife and child, are murdered by a band of Confederate soldiers. A century later, Joshua is resurrected by the Crow and hunts down the soldiers, who have been reincarnated as a biker gang. =Iris Shaw= Iris appears in the three issue series The Crow: Flesh and Blood and is the first woman to assume the role. Iris is a Federal Conservation officer who is killed, along with her unborn child, by terrorists. The Crow resurrects her to hunt them down. She seems to be not completely invincible, as, according to the Crow, she must complete her mission before she rots. Thus, she cannot really heal, and uses a stapler to repair her wounds. =Michael Korby= Michael appears in the three-issue series The Crow: Wild Justice. Michael and his wife are murdered during a car jacking. He is brought back by two crows named Hugo and Manny respectively, and must avenge his and his wife's death before the Gorgon blood running through his veins runs out. The Gorgon god tattoos Michael's body, which gives him the power to regenerate until the blood runs out. =Mark Leung= Mark appears in the four-issue series The Crow: Waking Nightmares. Mark and his wife are murdered by the Chinese Mafia. Instead of going after their killers, Mark returns to save his twin daughters, whom the mob have sold into slavery. =Leandre= Leandre appears in The French Crow, Vols. 2 and 3, published in France in 2007, in the two-part story \\"The Medieval Crow\\".

Elorah is an undercover police officer investigating a narcotics baron; after being murdered and revived by a Spirit Crow, she must now face not only her murderer but his creation: a cyborg that feeds on blood. =Jamie Osterberg= Appearing in the five issue series The Crow: Death And Rebirth, Jamie Osterberg is a foreign exchange student studying in Tokyo, Japan. His fianc√©e Haruko and other friends vanish, only to return possessed by someone else. Jamie finds out too much and is killed. Resurrected by the power of The Crow, with a sword that seeks truth, he learns that the \\"possession\\" was caused by a process that can insert one person's mind into another person's body and that Haruko was taken because an old rich dying woman wanted a new life in Haruko's body. Jamie hunts down those responsible to free the souls of his friends and be reunited with his one true love ... even if it means allying himself with Japanese ghosts and demons and following a path of vengeance through the different Japanese Hells (see Diyu). =The Man= The protagonist of the three issue series The Crow: Skinning The Wolves, which takes place at a Nazi concentration camp. The Man, whose name is never revealed, is an inmate whom the camp's commandant murders after losing to him in a game of chess.

Death itself. =David Amadio= In The Crow: Momento Mori, David is a Catholic altar boy who is killed along with his girlfriend Sarah and dozens of others in a terrorist attack in Rome, Italy. Resurrected as the Crow, he wreaks vengeance on those who committed the atrocity, but wiping out the terrorists does not prove the end of the story, as the mastermind behind the attack and the reasons for it still remain a mystery that he must solve before he can rest in peace. =Marcus Grieves= In The Crow / Hack/Slash, Marcus was a young gay man in 1980s San Francisco who was murdered along with his lover by a gang of neo-Nazi skinheads in a homophobic attack. He killed all the skinheads, but was reactivated decades later to deal with the Angeles Cero situation. =Angeles Cero= Also in The Crow / Hack/Slash, Angeles was a graffiti artist who was murdered along with her twin sister by Angeles's abusive ex-lover, a police cadet. Angeles killed the killer, but fell under the influence of her acquaintance Urban DK, an \\"urban shaman\\" who imprisoned her crow to allow her to continue killing members of the San Francisco police force and political establishment who helped cover up the murder. In other media=FilmEric Draven= Eric Draven was portrayed by actor Brandon Lee in the 1994 film The Crow, based on the comic book. The film had the same basic premise, except that the couple were murdered in their loft apartment because they were fighting tenant eviction instead of being murdered on the side of the road for fun. The film supplies Eric and Shelley with the respective last names Draven and Webster; in the graphic novel, they were referred to only by their first names. In the movie Eric depends on the Crow's health (which is a real bird) to be invincible (unlike the book where Eric is totally invincible and the crow is kind of a spirit that mostly only Eric sees). =Ashe Corven= He appears in The Crow: City of Angels, the sequel to The Crow. Ashe Corven (portrayed by Vincent P√©rez) is resurrected by the magical crow to avenge the death of his son Danny, who was killed along with him after accidentally witnessing a gang committing a murder. Like his predecessor, Ashe successfully kills each of the gang members until he meets the crime boss who ordered his death. The crime boss, Judah Earl (portrayed by Richard Brooks), wishes to obtain Ashe's powers for himself and will do his worst to gain them. In his endeavors, Ashe is assisted by Sarah (from the original film; now portrayed by Mia Kirshner). Sarah provides Ashe's facial make-up in honor of Eric and helps him in his mission. While Ashe is on his way to kill Judah after dispatching his gang, Judah captures his spirit crow and drinks its blood, gaining Ashe's powers. While the film's ending has Ashe and Danny reunited, the original intended ending leaves Ashe unable to move on to the Afterlife, condemning him to wander the Earth. =Alexander Frederick \\"Alex\\" Corvis= He appears in The Crow: Salvation, the third movie in the series. Alexander Frederick \\"Alex\\" Corvis (portrayed by Eric Mabius) is convicted of murdering his girlfriend, Lauren (portrayed by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), and then executed in the electric chair. Alex is assisted by Lauren's younger sister, Erin (portrayed by Kirsten Dunst), as they uncover the mystery surrounding the murder. Alex is the only reborn whose make-up appeared mysteriously and wasn't provided purposefully, but rather appeared in the form of burn scars on his face. =James \\"Jimmy\\" Cuervo= Appears in The Crow: Wicked Prayer, the fourth movie in the series, which was based on the fifth book of the Crow series of the same name (Dan Cody was the character's name in the book). As in the book, James \\"Jimmy\\" Cuervo (portrayed in the movie by Edward Furlong) and his girlfriend Lily \\"Ignites the Dawn\\" (Leticia \\"Dreams The Truth\\" Hardin in the novel and portrayed by Emmanuelle Chriqui in the film) are hunted down by a gang of Satanists who want to steal her eyes for use in an outlandish ritual. She and Jimmy are both killed in the process. Jimmy then goes on a journey to avenge his and his girlfriend's death and take down the satanists in the process. TelevisionEric Draven= Eric was also portrayed by Mark Dacascos in the television series The Crow: Stairway to Heaven in 1998. This version of Eric differed slightly from the other versions in that his mission wasn't about revenge, but about redemption. 22 episodes were produced in which Eric acts as a vigilante helping the needy, before the series was pulled in 1999. =Hannah Foster= Played by Bobbie Phillips, she appears in The Crow: Stairway to Heaven. Hannah Foster is brought back to life one year after she and her daughter are killed. Like Draven, Hannah has a Spirit Crow and possesses all of the Crow's powers. However, unlike Eric, she constantly battles between the need for redemption and her lust for vengeance; also, her methods for dealing with her opposition are far more severe than Draven's.

Novels=William Blessing He appears in The Crow: Quote the Crow, the first published novel in the series. Blessing is a popular horror writer who is murdered by his jealous prot√©g√© Donald Marquette, aided by a goth gang with literary aspirations. His wife is viciously raped in the encounter, and Blessing is brought back to exact vengeance. Blessing's body is continually on the verge of rotting away, his willpower to complete his mission the only thing holding him together. It is also implied that Blessing's healing abilities are actually the result of eating his victims. Jared Poe He appears in The Crow: The Lazarus Heart, the second published novel in the series. Poe is a controversial S&M; photographer who becomes the target of a serial killer in Louisiana who preys on gay men and transsexuals. He is wrongfully arrested by members of a homophobic police force and convicted for the murder of his homosexual lover (who was actually killed by the serial killer), and while on Death Row is murdered by a fellow inmate whose brother was one of the serial killer's victims and who believed that Poe was the killer. Upon his rebirth, he tries to track down the real killer with the help of his lover's transsexual sister, while also avenging himself on the homophobes who were responsible for his arrest, conviction and death. This novel's basic plot was the direct inspiration for The Crow: Salvation. Amy Carlisle She appears in The Crow: Clash by Night, the third published novel in the series. Amy is a day care owner who is killed in a bombing, along with some of the children she watches, when a militia group calling themselves The Sons of America tries to kill a popular senator who was supposed to have been visiting the center but who pulled out at the last minute.

Dan Cody He appears in The Crow: Wicked Prayer, the fifth published novel in the series and the basis for the film of the same name. He and his girlfriend Leticia \\"Dreams The Truth\\" Hardin are murdered by John Church and Kyra Damon, who have learned about the power of The Crow, who want immortality and who need Leticia's eyes to achieve it. Dan is resurrected, then goes on a journey to avenge his and his girlfriend's deaths. Billy Parker and Dren They appear in The Crow: Hellbound, the last published novel, dating from 2001. In this book, a demon named Dren is looking for salvation; Satan's fiery underworld has become a foreign place to him and he feels he is different from the other souls. After escaping from Hell, Dren must save a single soul in order to pass on to the heavens above. Billy is a young hoodlum working for a big-time mobster, and like Dren he has also changed and wants out of the seedy underworld he calls his home. But neither the mob nor Hell look kindly on deserters; Satan has sent two rogue demons to stop Dren and the mob has hired a conjurer named Nadja to kill Billy. In the end, the two must call on the powers of the Crow to save them both and to escape their own hells ‚Äî waging a full-scale war on the mobsters of Earth above and the lord of darkness below. BibliographyPopular culture *Eric Draven (alongside his crow) appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Cannot Be Erased, So Sorry\\" voiced by Simon Pegg. In a segment that parodies The Wizard of Oz, the Nerd (voiced by Seth Green) spices up his dream by imagining Eric Draven in place of the Scarecrow (along with Optimus Prime replacing the Tin Man and Lion-O replacing the Cowardly Lion). When engaging a flying monkey at the castle of the Wicked Witch of the West, Eric explains the meaning of existence in such a depressing way that the flying monkey hangs himself. Eric then sheds a single tear. *In the season two episode of the Comedy Central program Workaholics titled \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Roommates\\", Anders is shown to have attended Eric Draven Middle School. *Professional wrestler Sting used the Crow facepaint for his darker persona in late 1996 and still uses a modified version of it to this day. The original face paint was a near identical replica of Eric Draven's face paint with the exception of a frown being painted on his lips instead of a smile. The modified versions include longer trails on the eyes and mouth, resembling black blood.

This parasite is most common in the Middle East and has a wide host range including many economically important crops. Selective control of Egyptian broomrape is extremely difficult because the close association between host crop and parasite limits the use of most mechanical and herbicidal approaches.  Disease cycle  A single Egyptian broomrape plant is capable of producing hundreds of thousands of extremely small (0.15-0.5 mm long) seeds. These seeds, dispersed by the wind, animals, or by more artificial means such as farm machinery, survive in the soil and have the ability to remain viable in the soil for more than 15 years. When the seeds are dropped, they are dormant. They require after-ripening, or further ripening after the seed has fallen from the plant, which is completed by the time the dry season has ended. As the rainy season begins, the seeds imbibe water and move into a conditioning phase which lasts 1‚Äì3 weeks, depending on whether the temperature remains optimal, between 60 and 70 ¬∞F. At this point, the seeds only need a chemical signal from the roots of a host plant to germinate. The seeds can remain in this conditioned state for several months. If the seed never receives the chemical signal to germinate and dries out, it returns to its dormant state, ready to be reconditioned when the next rainy season begins.http://www.infonet-biovision.org/default/ct/705/pests (dead link) and http://www.infonet-biovision.org/PlantHealth/Pests/Broomrape When a conditioned seed receives a chemical signal from a host plant, it germinates, forming a germ tube which grows toward the host. From this germ tube, it grows a haustorium, which is the part of the broomrape which attaches the parasite to the host and grows into the host‚Äôs vascular system. The parasite is then able to draw out water and nutrients from its host.Hanan Eizenberg, Tal Lande, Gay Achdari, Asia Roichman and Joseph Hershenhorn, Effect of Egyptian Broomrape (Orobanche aegyptiaca) Seed-Burial Depth on Parasitism Dynamics and Chemical Control in Tomato, Weed Science, Vol. 55, No. 2 (Mar. - Apr., 2007), pp. 152‚Äì156 At this point, O. aegyptiaca grows rapidly, developing above- ground flower stalks. The flowers develop between February and May.http://www.flowersinisrael.com/Orobancheaegyptiaca_page.htm A medium-sized plant can produce more than 400 flowers, which each produce around 500 seeds. The complete lifecycle of this parasite, if completed in one season, lasts 10 to 15 weeks.  Hosts and symptoms  The host range for Egyptian broomrape is fairly wide, including many broadleaf vegetables, field crops, and some ornamentals. Tomato, potato, tobacco, eggplant, peppers, peas, carrot, celery, mustard, spinach, and chrysanthemum are among the susceptible plants. In areas such as southern Russia, melons are also potential hosts. Some plant species have been reported as being hosts for O. aegyptiaca that, in reality, are not hosts. Because the physical attachment of the parasite occurs below ground, checking that the plant‚Äôs roots are connected to the weed is essential. The most obvious sign of O. aegyptiaca parasitism is the visible parasitic plant near the base of the plant being attacked. Egyptian broomrape is a very short plant with purple flowers and a purple to brown stem. Plants that have been parasitized by this weed will show evidence of water stress, leaf yellowing, and stunted growth.  Environment  Orobanche aegyptiaca is adapted to soils with a high pH, like those in the Middle East where it is native, and requires high temperatures for ideal germination and growth. Because O. aegyptiaca is an obligate parasite it is found only in association with the crops it attacks, especially irrigated crops.Ghannam, I., R. Barakat, & M. Al-Masri. \\"Biological control of Egyptian broomrape (Orobanche aegyptiaca) using Fusarium spp..\\" Phytopathologia Mediterranea [Online], 46.2 (2007): 177-184. Web. 24 Oct. 2012  Management  Three main types of control exist for Orobanche aegyptiaca: chemical, cultural, and biological. Chemical control can be achieved by soil fumigation with methyl bromide. This method is effective yet is rarely used because only a shallow layer of the soil is affected, it is a costly treatment, and methyl bromide poses environmental concerns. Another form of chemical control is soil solarization, which is a solar heating of the soil by placing clear polyethylene sheets over moist soil.Sedigheh S, Aptin R, Zoheir Y.A, Application Soil Solarization, on the Control of Egyptian Broomrape in Greenhouse, International Journal of Natural and Engineering Sciences 3 (1): 59-64, 2009 This kills the majority of seeds that are viable and induces secondary dormancy in the rest.A. Greenberger, J. Katan, M. Levi and H. Alon,Control of Egyptian Broomrap (Orobanche aegyptiaca) and Other Weeds by Means of Solar Heating of the Soil by Polyethylene Mulching, R. Jacobsohn, Weed Science, Vol. 28, No. 3 (May, 1980), pp. 312‚Äì316 Lastly, sulfonylurea and imidazolinone herbicides have been shown in many studies to be an effective form of chemical control for O. aegyptiaca with the efficacy depending on the method of application, the species of crop, and the timing of the application. One study has shown application times between 14 and 42 days after planting to be ideal for controlling Egyptian broomrape.Hanan Eizenberg, Yaakov Goldwasser, Snmuel Golan, Dina Plakhine, and Joseph Hershenhorn (2004) Egyptian Broomrape (Orobanche aegyptiaca) Control in Tomato with Sulfonylurea Herbicides‚ÄîGreenhouse Studies. Weed Technology: July 2004, Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 490‚Äì496. Some forms of cultural control of O. aegyptiaca include sanitation efforts to help prevent the movement of seeds, individual picking of weeds by hand, and avoidance by changing the sowing time or not growing a host plant. Reducing spread of infected soil by farm machinery, avoidance of grazing on infected plants, and staying away from the use of hay produced from Orobanche- infested plants are all methods to help prevent the movement of seeds. The individual picking of weeds by hand is very important, as the plant is able continue living as only a stem and produce a flower that can spread seeds even while not connected to the host. Any avoidance strategy must be carried out with a plant that cannot be parasitized by O. aegyptiaca and could take up to 20 years to complete, as this is how long the plant's seeds can remain viable in the soil. Also, because seeds can safely pass through an animal's digestive system, ensuring manure is not contaminated is important. Another option for cultural control is the use of trap crops or catch crops. Trap crops promote the germination of O. aegyptiaca seeds, but do not allow parasitism; these include flax, mung bean, maize, and sorghum. Catch crops allow parasitism, but are destroyed before the parasitic plants flower, so the broomrape seeds cannot be produced and dispersed. Finally, limited success has been seen with host plant resistance in sunflower, faba bean, lentil, and tomato. Resistant cultivars of sunflower were bred in Russia and Spain, but quickly lost their host-plant resistance due to selection towards more aggressive biotypes of the plant that had adapted to the new cultivars. In the resistant sunflower cultivars, germination was still induced, but the plant's germ tube never develops after penetration by the haustorium.Eizenberg, H., D. Plakhine, J. Hershenhorn, Y. Kleifeld, and B. Rubin. \\"Resistance to Broomrape (Orobanche spp.) in Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) Is Temperature-dependent.\\" Journal of Experimental Botany 54.385 (n.d.): 1305-311 Macromolecules are transferred from the host to the parasite, so one method for resistance is the introduction of an antimicrobial gene from the flesh fly into the host genome. This allows for its protein product to be transferred to the parasite and work as a means of control.Hamamouch, Noureddine. \\"Engineering Resistance to Orobanche Aegyptiaca: Evidence of Sarcotoxin IA as an Anti-Parasite Protein and Macromolecule Movement from Host to Parasite.\\" Diss. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 2004 Most forms of biological control are still being developed and studied, although three species are potential forms of control: Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. F. oxysporum has been shown to successfully control O. aegyptica in sunflower and tobacco, while S. sclerotiorum has been shown to cause wet rot in the plant without having any negative impact on the host. Field experiments carried out in Hungary showed promise for control with some \\"F. solani\\" isolates. The \\"Fusarium\\" species usually work through phytotoxins that help them to conquer O. aegyptica 's defenses and establish themselves.  Importance  Because Egyptian broomrape can cause severe damage to economic crops and ornamentals, it is important to understand the plant as a parasite and to fully comprehend its life cycle. By understanding its lifecycle, management is possible. In Israel, the production of processing tomatoes is in danger as a result of high crop yield losses due to heavy infestations of O. aegyptiaca. Approximately $1.3 to 2.6 billion have been lost in annual food crop losses in the regions near the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, and Asia. Egyptian broomrape and branched broomrape (O. ramosa) have infested an annual average of 2.6 million ha of crops from the family Solanaceae, including tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant.

In body modification, an implant is a device is placed under the human skin for decorative purposes. Such implants may be subdermal or transdermal. In the context of body modification, some may consider injections of silicone and other substances a type of implant as well. Some types of implants may be performed by doctors or other medical professionals, while others are performed by body modification artists. Implants and procedures=Clavicle or collarbone piercing A very deep piercing that passes beneath the collarbone, and therefore enters the body cavity. These are highly prone to rejection as the collarbone placement is a high movement area. Also, because of the depth of the piercinggoing deep under the collarbone and through a large amount of flesh and musclehealing is difficult. With all the movement in the area the fistula cannot heal properly, and will hurt far worse than a hip piercing. Deep chest piercing A deep chest piercing is a long piercing that passes under the skin of the chest and may be several inches long. Eyeball implant An eyeball implant, or extraocular implant, is a cosmetic implant involving a tiny piece of decorative jewelry which is implanted within the superficial, interpalpebral conjunctiva of the human eye (the covering of the white of the eye, in the area that is normally visible between the eyelids). Such implants are illegal in the United States. Flesh stapling, flesh plating and pocketing A flesh staple is a type of piercing jewelry or implant in which the middle rather than the end of the jewelry is exposed when worn. The jewelry resembles a staple, the ends of which pierce the skin and hold the item in place. A flesh plate works on the same principle, but has a different shape, resembling a flat plate rather than a staple. Flesh pocketing resembles flesh stapling, but instead of staple-like geometry, small \\"pockets\\" under the skin hold the ends of the jewelry in place. Pocketing has a lower rate of success than stapling.BME (Body Modification Ezine) wiki: Pocketing Genital beading and genital ribs Genital beading (also known as yakuza beads, love beads or pearling) is a process in which beads or other small objects are implanted beneath the shaft skin of the penis, Genital ribs are short, slightly curved rods of various materials such as stainless steel, titanium, teflon, or silicone placed under the shaft skin of the penis. Horn implants In this modification, small pieces of Teflon, coral or silicone are inserted beneath the skin of the forehead, giving the appearance of small horns. These can be gradually replaced with larger and larger pieces as the skin stretches, creating larger horns. Coral is no longer used for larger horns, as it tends to be too brittle. The first set of horn implants were done by Steve Haworth on The Enigma. Steve Haworth invented this type of modification. He currently uses silicone for his horn implants.Piercing is for Wimps Magnetic implants An experimental procedure in which small neodymium magnets are placed under the skin (usually the fingertips) mostly for the purpose of sensory experimentation, in which the movement of the implant in the presence of magnetic fields can be felt by the individual.Wired - Magnetic Implants Such implants can, in this way, be employed to convert non-human sensory information, such as sonar/distance, into touch.J. Hameed, I. Harrison, M. N. Gasson and K. Warwick, ‚ÄúA Novel Human-Machine Interface using Subdermal Magnetic Implants‚Äù, Proc. IEEE International Conference on Cybernetic Intelligent Systems, Reading, pp. 106-110, Sept. 2010 They have been proposed for attaching objects such as eyeglasses or jewelry to the skin, but in practice this has turned out not to be feasible, as the skin is damaged by being crushed between the object and the magnet. Scrotal implant A scrotal implant is an implant placed into the scrotum. The implants may be designed for this purpose (for example, Neuticles), or be of any implant-grade material. Subdermal implant Subdermal implants, objects inserted under the skin, are used in medical applications such as pacemakers and the Norplant contraceptive. There is also historical evidence that some tribal cultures would insert stones or metal underneath the skin for ritualistic purposes. In the early 1990s, body modification artist Steve Haworth conceived of inserting 3D art implants in various shapes under the skin to create a decorative appearance. He started with surgical steel and moved on to teflon and then carved silicone, and now uses injection-molded implant-grade silicone that he produces. Other artists have since manufactured silicone implants using water jet cutting or \\"cookie cutter\\", but these often have undesirably sharp edges which can damage the skin. Subdermal implants are usually installed by creating a hole in the skin which is expanded to allow insertion of the object, and then sutured closed. MagnetsI.Harrison, K.Warwick and V.Ruiz (2018), \\"Subdermal Magnetic Implants: An Experimental Study\\", Cybernetics and Systems, 49(2), 122-150. and RFID transmitters have also been implanted in humans using this method. Surface piercing A surface piercing is a piercing that travels beneath the surface of the skin (on the arm, for example) rather than through a protruding portion of the anatomy such as the earlobe. Surface piercings can be placed on nearly any area of the body, provided they are not subject to too much movement or the risk of impact damage or infection from contact with contaminants such as dirt. A surface piercing should be done with high grade titanium in a staple shaped bar. Curved barbells or straight barbells put too much pressure on the entry holes to be suitable. Once a surface piercing bar is in, it is recommended that you not attempt to remove or change the staple shaped bar yourself; this should be done only by a highly trained and experienced piercer. The balls, however, are safe for the wearer to change. Surface piercings can be more or less prone to rejection, depending on where on the body they are situated. For example, the nape of the neck is less likely to reject a surface piercing than the sternum. Microdermals and Skin Divers are becoming more popular than surface piercings, as they last much longer and are less likely to be rejected. Transdermal implant A transdermal implant (or percutaneous implant), also known as a microdermal implant or surface anchor, is an implant incorporating a flat plate that sits beneath the skin with an externally visible portion incorporating a bead, spike or other item that appears to float on the surface of the skin. Due to the fact that the skin is held open by the metal and a fistula must form around it, similar to a piercing on a larger scale, healing can sometimes be difficult or lengthy. If the practitioner is skilled and the person receiving the modification takes good care of it, it can have a high success rate. The first transdermal implant was a \\"Metal Mohawk\\" performed on Joe Aylward by Steve Haworth in 1996.http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1997-03-27/news/mane-of-steel/ Aylward retained his transdermal \\"mohawk\\" for almost a decade, until, for personal reasons, he asked Haworth to remove it.

Biography He was born in Kryviakino, Russia, the son of Mikhail and Maria (Schneidmann) Padwa. He was raised in Estonia, then a territory of Imperial Russia, receiving Estonian citizenship in 1917 when Estonia became an independent country. He married Alexandra Niedas of Tallinn in 1927. The couple resided in London and Berlin before coming to the United States in 1932. Their daughter Tatiana was born in 1933. The family settled in New York City and later lived in Woodstock, New York from 1935 to 1946. Padwa and Alexandra divorced in 1946, and he married Natalie Joy Lozier in the same year. Their son Thomas was born in 1953. Padwa became a U.S. citizen in 1948, and from that year made his home in New York City. Career He was educated at the Conservatories of St. Petersburg, Berlin and Leipzig, receiving the Matura degree from Leipzig in 1924. At the age of 17, he was also co-founder in 1917 of the State Conservatory of Music in Tallinn, Estonia. He was the last pupil of Ferruccio Busoni in Berlin and then studied with Busoni‚Äôs master pupil Michael Zadora. He gave concerts throughout Europe, and in collaboration with the Neo-Bechstein company, he was director of and a performer in the first broadcast of all-electronic music from Berlin, in 1932. Padwa‚Äôs collaboration with Bechstein resulted in 1932 in a six-month contract with Radio-Keith Orpheum (RKO) and the Radio City Theaters to perform in America on the Bechstein electric piano as part of the Inaugural Roxy radio broadcast from Radio City Music Hall in New York City on November 13, 1932. Before ending his contract in 1933, he performed regularly in radio broadcasts and gave the first live solo piano broadcast of electronic music in the U.S. His concert career included a seven-year association as accompanist to violinist Mischa Elman, with whom he made four successful world tours to five continents from 1934 to 1940.Kozinn, Allan (1990). Mischa Elman and the Romantic Style, pp. 169-95. Harwood Academic Publishers. . In the 1930s and 1940s Padwa also participated in the Maverick Concert Hall music series in Woodstock, New York. In 1940 he was musical director of the Woodstock Playhouse Concerts. In 1941, along with pianists Adam Garner, Frank Mittler, and Edward Edson, he founded the nationally acclaimed First Piano Quartet. The FPQ was heard regularly on radio and recorded for RCA Victor. He became professor of music at the New York College of Music in 1948, and was named chairman of the piano department in 1967; In 1968, the College of Music merged with New York University, where he became Associate Professor of Music Education. After 1948 he spent his summers composing at the Vermont Toy Farm in Essex Junction, Vermont. In 1958 he was made an honorary member of the Accademia Internazionale Di Roma. During the 1960s and 1970s he was an adjudicator for the New Brunswick Competitive Festival of Music and Quebec Music Festivals, for whom he was commissioned to write piano pieces to be used in sight reading competitions. Thiel College awarded him an honorary doctorate in music in 1978. He composed music for a wide range of instruments and was a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, from which he received the Standard Panel Awards annually from 1968-1980. Professor Padwa maintained a full teaching and performing schedule to the end of his life. A collection of his music and papers is maintained at the music library of the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, in the U.S.A.The New York Times, May 1, 1981.

He is particularly associated with research into the lives of the musicians Charlie Patton and Robert Johnson and the historical development of the Delta blues, on which he is a leading authority. He was born in Freer, Texas, but was brought up from the age of six in Meridian, Mississippi. In his teens he began collecting Roy Acuff 78s. He originally began collecting blues records so as to exchange them for Acuff's. However, by about 1960 he had started collecting blues records for their own sake, and realised that very little biographical information existed on the musicians who had created them. By 1963, Wardlow had begun researching a book on Delta blues musicians, mainly by making enquiries in black neighbourhoods, recording oral histories, anecdotes, songs, and remembrances. He interviewed Ishman Bracey, Charlie Patton's widow, and blues talent broker H. C. Speir, and a few years later uncovered Robert Johnson's death certificate. Hayes McMullan's musical talents were unearthed following a chance encounter in 1967 between Wardlow and McMullan. Wardlow transcribed the songs and penned the sleevenotes for the 2017 CD release of McMullan's Everyday Seem Like Murder Here, issued over 30 years after McMullan's death. In the process of his overall research work, Wardlow became a leading authority on country blues. He also amassed the world‚Äôs largest and most valuable collection of pre-war blues records, many of which are now unique. Wardlow has published many articles on blues history and the book Chasin' That Devil Music: Searching for the Blues, which was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2006 as a classic of blues literature. In 2019 Wardlow co-authored, with Bruce Conforth, the Robert Johnson biography, Up Jumped the Devil: The Real Life of Robert Johnson, which has been called \\"the definitive Robert Johnson biography\\". The book won the 2020 Penderyn Prize for being the best music book of any type for 2019.

It was opened in 1847 by the Caledonian Railway. The approach to Glasgow used railways already built, primarily for mineral traffic; these were later by-passed by a more direct route. Today, the route forms the northern section of the West Coast Main Line, and was electrified in the early 1970s. Opening The Caledonian main line, 1848‚Äì1849 From 1830 onwards considerable attention was given to the means by which Glasgow and Edinburgh might be connected to London, and as English railways began to develop into a network, the urgency of making a railway accelerated. The difficult terrain of the Southern Uplands and Cumberland made the selection of a route controversial. After much difficulty, the Caledonian Railway was authorised to build a line via Beattock; this was known as the Annandale Route. On 10 September 1847 the line was opened between Carlisle and Beattock. The station at Carlisle was built and operated jointly with the London and North Western Railway. (Later other companies shared in the operation there.) Construction continued and on 15 February 1848 the line was opened between Beattock and Glasgow, completing the Carlisle to Glasgow route. Finally the line from Carstairs to Edinburgh opened on 1 April 1848.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, First configuration=Carlisle to Carstairs At first the southern termination of the line was at Carlisle station, later named Carlisle Citadel; passengers and goods were handled there. The line ran broadly north across gently undulating country at first, crossing the River Esk and entering Scotland near Gretna, then climbing following the Kirtle Water to Lockerbie. Climbing further, the line followed the Annan Water to Beattock, and on to Beattock Summit. Crossing the watershed, the line now descended in the upper Clyde Valley; the course of the Clyde here is much more hilly and the line follows a series of broad reverse curves as it continues through Abington and Thankerton, emerging on to slightly flatter terrain at Carstairs. Carstairs to Glasgow Now turning north-west, the Glasgow line continues past Lanark and near Carluke, joining the Wishaw and Coltness Railway (W&CR;) at Garriongill Junction. The W&CR; had been built as a \\"coal railway\\", primarily intended for the haulage of coal and iron ore. It had been upgraded and modernised, and leased by the Caledonian Railway. The main line used the W&CR; line to Motherwell, from which point the original route is not part of the modern main line. It turned north through to Whifflat (now spelt Whifflet), joining the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway (GG&CR;). This too had been built as a coal railway, and had been upgraded and renamed the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway; it too was leased by the Caledonian Railway. From Whifflat the line ran to Coatbridge, and then turned west on through Garnkirk, terminating at the GG&CR; Glasgow terminus at Townhead. The approach to Glasgow made a long northward sweep, and the Townhead terminus was not well located for central Glasgow. During the process of obtaining Parliamentary authorisation for its line, the Caledonian discovered that an independent Clydesdale Junction Railway was also being authorised. The Caledonian quickly took control of the Clydesdale Junction by leasing it during construction; it opened throughout on 1 June 1849. Its route left the Wishaw and Coltness line at Motherwell, and ran via Uddingston and Rutherglen to a terminus called Southside in Glasgow, at the junction of Cathcart Road and Pollokshaws Road. This too was inconveniently located for the city centre, but the Caledonian now had two routes to two terminal stations in Glasgow. The Clydesdale Junction route now forms the northern end of the modern Caledonian main line, extended from South Side to cross the River Clyde to Glasgow Central Station.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, Carstairs to Edinburgh The Edinburgh section of the Caledonian main line left Carstairs station and ran north-east. For several years passenger trains from Carlisle divided at Carstairs; the Glasgow portion proceeded, and the Edinburgh portion reversed direction towards the capital. It is likely that goods trains too ran to Carstairs and remarshalled there. A cut-off line was constructed enabling direct running from Carlisle towards Edinburgh, but it was little used and it was soon closed. Later a shorter chord line was built having the same effect. The line continued past Cobbinshaw and Kirknewton, descending into Edinburgh in the valley of the Water of Leith. The terminus was at Lothian Road; this was later altered to Princes Street by a short extension and enlargement. Competition for traffic to England The main line as planned was hoped to be the sole connection between Scottish cities and the English network. In fact this proved ill-founded, as the North British Railway opened its line to Berwick- upon-Tweed, forming part of a line to London that became known as the East Coast Main Line in alliance with English lines. At first this route involved two changes of trains until bridges over the River Tweed at Berwick and the River Tyne at Newcastle were completed. This route was competitive for transits from Edinburgh to London, but Glasgow was less conveniently served. On the west side of the country the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) had a route between Glasgow and Carlisle; however it was hampered by reliance on the Caledonian Railway route for the final approach to Carlisle, and primacy of the Caledonian Railway and its English ally, the LNWR, there. The G&SWR; route was uncompetitive for traffic to and from Edinburgh. A third route was another North British Railway route that became known as the Waverley Route between Edinburgh and Carlisle. This route too suffered from the dominance of the Caledonian and LNWR at Carlisle. When the Midland Railway opened its line from London to Carlisle via Leeds, the G&SWR; and the NBR Waverley route had access southwards over a friendly railway at last. Development after first construction In its early years the Caledonian Railway sought to become dominant in large areas of Scotland by leasing nascent companies. It was able to do so by guaranteeing lease payments in perpetuity, which avoided any need for cash at the time, but heavily indebted the company later. It saw the best opportunities to the north of the central belt, and in Ayrshire. As the company matured, it encouraged local promoters to start construction of branch lines, taking them over by purchase if they were successful. The principal effect of this on the main line was the construction of a branch line from Gartsherrie to Greenhill Junction, there meeting the Scottish Central Railway, and giving access to Stirling and Perth. A first, short section of this branch used the route of the earlier Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (M&KR;), another modernised coal railway. The M&KR; was not brought into the Caledonian family, and through trains from the Caledonian at Motherwell towards Stirling used a rival company's track until nationalisation of the railways in 1948. A development that had not been foreseen was the emergence of the Monklands iron industry, which generated a huge demand for good quality iron ore and coal, and the Caledonian was fortunate that considerable reserves lay in areas served by it, or otherwise accessible over it. These factors led to a limited number of intermediate stations on the main line, and a concentration of effort elsewhere. There were no new branches off the main line at first, but the \\"Lanark\\" station was a considerable distance from the important Burgh, and local interests promoted a branch line to Lanark, which opened in 1855. The Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway promoted a branch to Biggar; it was opened in 1860 after the local company had been acquired by the Caledonian, and the line was extended to Peebles in 1864. In 1863 an independent branch line was opened to Dumfries, the Dumfries, Lochmaben and Lockerbie Railway was opened. The Caledonian acquired the line in 1865. The Portpatrick Railway had opened in 1861-1862 and the Caledonian worked it. This gave it access from Lockerbie to Stranraer and Portpatrick, enabling it to develop ferry services to the north of Ireland. It routed traffic from there to Glasgow and Edinburgh via Lockerbie, bringing considerable additional traffic to the main line. When the Portpatrick Railway was reconstituted into the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway, the Caledonian was a one-quarter owner. The Dolphinton Branch was opened in 1867 from Carstairs; Dolphinton was a small settlement and the construction of the line was purely tactical. Mineral extraction in Cumberland around Workington developed considerably, and much of the output went to the Lanarkshire iron works over the Caledonian main line. In 1869 an independent Solway Junction Railway was opened, with a long viaduct over the Solway Firth, and shortening the journey from Workington to the Monklands. From the outset, the rival Glasgow and South Western Railway had intended to build an independent line to Carlisle from Gretna, but this was forbidden by Parliament during the authorisation process. The G&SWR; was required to make a junction with the Caledonian main line at Gretna Junction, and to run over the line into Carlisle. That arrangement started in 1850, and the former G&SWR; still operates, making the connection at Gretna Junction as before. All the other branches referred to in this section have closed, with the exception of the Lanark branch. The main line from 1879 The Caledonian main line in 1879 The first main line cemented the configuration of the Caledonian Railway route to England. It was enhanced by subsequent improvement of the route into Glasgow, as well as extension of the Edinburgh terminal named Princes Street, completed in 1870 and the expansion of goods facilities in Carlisle. The final development of the route had taken place by 1879, when the Glasgow terminal at Glasgow Central was opened. The station was considerably more convenient than the terminals previously in use. The original routing over the Wishaw and Coltness and the Glasgow Garnkirk and Coatbridge lines was now by-passed for main line passenger traffic, although still in use for local passenger traffic and considerable mineral usage. The Buchanan Street terminal was now focussed on passenger services to the Stirling line. At Carlisle the first passenger station remained in use, but the original goods facilities had been enhanced by the opening of a separate Viaduct goods station, and a route for goods and mineral trains passing the passenger station giving direct independent access from the Maryport and Carlisle Railway route; iron ore from Workington to the ironworks of the Monklands and become hugely significant by this time. The goods by-pass lines at Carlisle became very extensive and were jointly owned and operated by several railway companies. After 1879 By 1879 the shape of the Caledonian main line was substantially developed. Most of the branches that left the main line directly had been opened by then. The principal subsequent developments were: * comprehensive suburban development in greater Glasgow, redoubled in the last decades of the twentieth century; * duplication of the route from Law Junction in to Glasgow serving ironworks that later became Ravenscraig Steelworks, and giving enhanced access northwards to freight marshalling facilities at Mossend Yard; * the opening of a branch line to Moffat Railway Beattock in 1883; * the opening of the Leadhills and Wanlockhead Branch from Elvanfoot in 1901-1902; * considerably enhanced goods facilities at Carlisle; * extension lines in Edinburgh to serve docks at Granton and Leith; * late twentieth century opening or reopening of passenger stations in the Glasgow and Edinburgh travel-to-work areas. Development of passenger train services In 1850, the passenger service on the main line consisted of five trains daily from Carlisle to Glasgow, of which three were expresses. Two gave daytime transits from London, the faster taking 12 hours 55 minutes. The fastest journey from Carlisle to Glasgow took 3 hours 30 minutes, and all the trains carried portions to Edinburgh detached at Carstairs, or gave connections to Edinburgh there. There was a limited Sunday service.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 3rd mo, (March) 1850, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2012, As train service patterns settled down later in the nineteenth century, the Caledonian main line carried important express trains, as well as local stopping trains. In contrast to the frequent regular-interval services of the present day, the train frequency was limited. In 1895 there were four daytime expresses northbound; the first left Euston at 5.15 a.m. Many trains divided at Carstairs with separate portions from there to Edinburgh and in some cases Perth and Aberdeen. There were two sleeping car trains to Glasgow and two to Aberdeen. All the daytime trains called at Beattock, and there were four all-stations stopping trains as well as some short workings. The fastest journey from Carlisle to Glasgow took 2 hours 10 minutes.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, By 1922 there were five daytime express trains. Local passenger business had declined and there was only one all-stations train running throughout the route, but several very short workings and some semi-fast trains. The 10.00 a.m. express from Euston arrived at Glasgow Central at 6.30 p.m.; it was not named, and conveyed through carriages from Birmingham. It required 2 hours 26 minutes from Carlisle to Glasgow, calling only at Motherwell \\"when required\\". There were several night trains to Glasgow and to the northern lines.Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985 By 1938 there were still only four daytime through trains Monday to Friday, although there were considerably more summer Saturday trains, many of them going north to Stirling and beyond, and some originating from Liverpool. The stopping service on the route remained very thin indeed, although the Edinburgh line had more stopping trains. There were many more night trains, several of them seasonal, and many running to the north of Scotland. The 10.00 a.m. train from Euston was named The Royal Scot and took seven hours to Glasgow, and seven hours and five minutes to Edinburgh, advertised as conveying restaurant car to both terminals. The train called only at Carlisle intermediately.Bradshaw's July 1938 Railway Guide, reprinted by David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1969, From electrification of the main line by British Rail in 1974 the main line service was increased to an almost-regular two-hourly frequency. The best train took five hours between London Euston and Glasgow Central, but Edinburgh was not a destination served from London by this route. Trains from Liverpool and Manchester combined at Preston and divided again at Carstairs, giving through journeys to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Beattock station had closed by this time so that only Lockerbie, Carstairs and Motherwell were served by main line trains to Glasgow, and only Haymarket by Edinburgh trains. Avanti West Coast is the main operator on the London and Birmingham to Glasgow route. The main line service frequency is considerably better than ever before. TransPennine Express operate a frequent service between Manchester Airport and Glasgow and Edinburgh. Intermediate locations The original main line was selected as the optimum route through challenging terrain with a very limited population density, and there was little opportunity to deviate to serve intermediate towns and villages.

The North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway, and controlled the East Coast route. While some consolidation took place, the basic passenger train service pattern remained relatively unaltered for many years, indeed into the post-1948 era of nationalisation under British Railways. Electrification of the West Coast Main Line throughout between London, Birmingham and Glasgow encouraged concentration of long distance passenger traffic on the Caledonian main line, and decline of the G&SWR; route. The Waverley Route closed in 1969. Electrification The Glasgow south side suburban service had been electrified by British Railways from 27 May 1962, when the Cathcart Circle, and Newton - Uddingston - Motherwell were operated electrically. Further electrification of the Hamilton circle, and to Lanark, followed and the main line southwards was being progressively wired, so that by the end of 1973 electric locomotives could be exchanged between Carlisle and Shields Depot, running for the time being via Kirkhill. From 6 May 1974 the Hamilton Circle and Lanark routes were fully available for electric passenger trains. (These trains ran to Glasgow Central High Level, as the Argyle Line had not yet been constructed.) Not all of the platforms at Glasgow Central were electrified at this stage, and when main line electrification was introduced, the remaining non-wired platforms had to be fitted. The southern sections of the West Coast Main Line were electrified in the period to 1969. In April 1970 authorisation was given for the electrification between Weaver Junction (in Cheshire) and Cleghorn Junction (to which the Lanark electrification had already been implemented). By July 1973 the line had been resignalled throughout, and from 7 January 1974 freight trains were electrically hauled between Kingmoor Yard at Carlisle and Mossend Yard. From 22 April 1974 passenger trains were electrically hauled throughout between London and Glasgow.J C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Train, Ian Allan Limited, London, 1988, Modern use of the Caledonian main line While the term Caledonian main line has no authoritative present-day definition, it is generally taken to mean the main line between Carlisle and Glasgow and Carstairs and Edinburgh. That is consistent with the first main line from Carlisle to Garriongill Junction, then following the Clydesdale Junction Railway route to Gushetfaulds, just outside South Side station, and then the later short line Glasgow Central station. The Edinburgh section runs from Carstairs to Edinburgh Waverley station; the final section of the original line to Princes Street was closed and trains diverted to Waverley. The route is now the northern section of the West Coast Main Line, and carries a heavy passenger and freight service. Current operations At the present day the main line has a heavy long-distance passenger service to London, Birmingham and Manchester. Significant freight traffic also runs over the line. The Carstairs to Edinburgh line carries a considerable long-distance passenger service, although London to Edinburgh is not realistically dominant now, compared to the East Coast main Line service. In the Edinburgh and Glasgow travel-to-work areas there is a heavy suburban passenger service. Notable among these is the Argyle line service which runs from Lanark to North Clyde destinations through the Argyle line in Glasgow. Numerous other suburban routes operate in the greater Glasgow and Edinburgh conurbations. Gradients The Caledonian Viaduct, over the route of the Monkland Canal at Coatbridge When the main line was conceived, there were misgivings about the capacity of the locomotive power of the day to handle trains over the heavy gradients approaching Beattock summit. By the time the line was opened, the technology of locomotive design had improved, and locomotive haulage was practicable. Nonetheless Beattock summit remained a significant operational limitation, and the provision of assistant engines for all but the lightest trains was routine from Beattock station to the summit throughout the era of steam traction. Leaving Carlisle, gradients were moderate until just before Gretna, from where a climb of 1 in 193 - 1 in 200 started as far as Castlemilk, beyond Ecclefechan. A slight decline then followed to Nethercleugh, where the climb resumed, stiffening again to 1 in 202 after Wamphray. At Beattock the serious climbing started with a gradient of 1 in 88 increasing to 1 in 74 for ten miles to Beattock Summit. A short fall of 1 in 89 for two miles to Elvanfoot followed. From there however the descent was more gentle and longer, at a typical gradient of 1 in 240 although with several short steeper sections. This reached as far as Carstairs, after which an eight-mile climb followed. There then followed a stiffer descent of up to 1 in 102 for sixteen miles to Uddingston. From there moderate undulations led to Glasgow Central station. The Carstairs to Edinburgh line had difficult gradients too. From Carstairs there was a climb of 1 in 225 stiffening to 1 in 97 as far as Cobbinshaw (eleven miles) then descending at 1 in 100 for five miles, slackening to 1 in 143 almost continuously as far as Edinburgh.Railway Gradients of the British Main-Line Railways, the Railway Publishing Company, London, 1947 Quintinshill Quintinshill, 1.3km (0.8mi) north of Gretna Green, was the site of the Quintinshill rail crash, which occurred at 6.49am on 22 May 1915.Rolt (1982), pp 207‚Äì213 ReferencesSources   * * External links * Railscot on Caledonian Railway * Railscot on Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway * Railscot on Wishaw and Coltness Railway * Railscot on Edinburgh Station and Branches Category:Early Scottish railway companies Category:London, Midland and Scottish Railway constituents Category:Pre- grouping British railway companies Category:Railway lines opened in 1831 Category:1831 establishments in Scotland Category:Anglo-Scottish border ","title":"Caledonian main line"},{"id":"12717415","text":"Science Sleuths was a series of interactive videos that were produced by Videodiscovery, Inc. from 1991 to 1996.

His most important initial contribution was the demonstration in the study of epileptic psychosis, that schizophrenia relates to left and manic-depressive states relate to right hemisphere epilepsies (Epilepsia, 1969).  Biography  Pierre Flor-Henry was born in Passy, Haute Savoie (in France), where his mother was Director of the Sanatorium \\"Roc des Fiz\\" and his father one of the architects that built the sanatorium where his parents practised medicine (Plateau d'Assy) France, Flor-Henry graduated from the Faculty of Medicine (1957), followed-up by a Ph.D. in Medicine (M.D. Edin) (1966) from the University of Edinburgh. Subsequent degrees and specializations were earned from the University of London, in the United Kingdom and in Quebec, Canada. His full title is Pierre Flor-Henry M.B., Ch.B., M.D. (Edin), Acad. D.P.M. (Lond), F.R.C. Psych., C.S.P.Q. (Psych). Flor-Henry‚Äôs general medicine practice took him through Western, Central, and Eastern Canada from 1958 ‚Äì 1963. Returning to the United Kingdom, he specialized in psychiatry, epilepsy, electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology at the Maudsley Hospital (1963-1968). He started at Alberta Hospital Edmonton in 1971 as a consulting psychiatrist. In 1976 he became a Clinical Professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta. In 1977 he added the Clinical Directorship, of Adult Psychiatry, Alberta Hospital Edmonton. In 1993 Flor-Henry undertook the Directorship of the Clinical Diagnostics and Research Centre (CDRC), Alberta Hospital Edmonton. All four positions have been held concurrently through present day.  Research  Much of Pierre Flor-Henry‚Äôs clinical and research is conducted in the CDRC which he established and directs. The CDRC is dedicated to offering clinical psychophysiological and neurophysiological assessments that contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of patients. The philosophy of the CDRC is to provide continuous improvement in the provision of assessment and treatment services through fundamental research and program evaluation. The CDRC provides a variety of tests of brain activity that is unique to a psychiatric facility in its breadth and scope. Assessments include clinical EEG recordings, electrocardiograms, multi-channel EEG brain mapping as well as auditory, somatosensory, and cognitive evoked potential recordings. Other assessments include recordings of autonomic nervous system modalities such as skin conductance and digital pulse volume. Basic research is conducted in the analysis of brain electrical activity in order to improve the understanding of abnormal cerebral mechanisms associated with mental illness and to improve the quality of assessment and treatment. The Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada awarded the Clinical Diagnostics and Research Centre full accreditation status as an electroencephalography and evoked potential neurophysiology laboratory. In recent years, Flor-Henry has engaged in multi- channel EEG investigations using source localization (LORETA) in a variety of psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, mania, depression, multiple personality, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and transsexualism. Also, he has investigated in a similar way, differences in EEG organization of normal males and females, of cerebral activity during verbal and spatial cognitive tasks, and of male/female difference in the psychoses. The publication and presentation of Flor-Henry‚Äôs findings from 1969 onwards has triggered an enormous amount of research internationally, on laterality and psychopathology. Flor-Henry‚Äôs research has extended his early findings to the study of the patterns of cerebral disorganization in a variety of mental disorders with neuropsychological and quantitative EEG approaches: e.g. in depression, schizophrenia, mania, psychopathy, sexual deviation, hysteria, multiple personality, obsessive compulsive disorder, and, in normal controls (task, age, and gender effects). In addition to his extensive empirical research, he has written, edited, and published a number of books integrating the findings in these areas along with theoretical reviews on the implications of disrupted lateral hemispheric organization in psychiatric conditions. In 2007, Dr. Flor- Henry was named the 2007 recipient for the Career Contribution Award from the EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society. This award was given in recognition of his lifetime contributions to clinical neurophysiology in psychiatry. Bibliography FLOR-HENRY, P. (1969).

Early career Born in the Netherlands, Intveld's parents moved to California when he was one year old. James Intveld began entering talent contests as a country music-singing teenager at the Palomino Club located in North Hollywood, California. Originally playing in The Rockin' Shadows with his brother Ricky Intveld, the band disbanded when Ricky and bassist Patrick Woodward were asked by Ricky Nelson to join his backing band, the Stone Canyon Band. Both Intveld's brother and Patrick Woodward were killed in the subsequent 1985 plane crash which also took Nelson's life. The Rockin‚Äô Shadows had recorded Intveld‚Äôs song \\"My Heart Is Achin' For You\\" for the 1983 compilation album, (Art Fein Presents) The Best of L.A. Rockabilly. As a songwriter, Intveld wrote \\"Crying Over You\\" recorded by Rosie Flores and released on her 1987 self-titled album. The aforementioned \\"My Heart Is Achin' For You\\" was covered by Sonny Burgess and Dave Alvin on Burgess‚Äô 1992 comeback album, Tennessee Border. Intveld played lead guitar for The Blasters until leaving the band amicably in 1995 to pursue his own projects including acting and a solo album which would be released in 1995. In 1995, Intveld released a solo album on Bear Family Records, Introducing James Intveld. Tracks included \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Blue Blue Day\\", \\"Cryin' Over You\\", \\"I'm To Blame\\", \\"Barely Hangin' On\\", \\"Samantha\\", \\"Your Lovin'\\", \\"You Say Goodnight, I'll Say Goodbye\\", \\"Kermit Vale\\", and \\"Wild Places\\".

A second volume of the Choppertown soundtrack, From the Vaults included Intveld‚Äôs recording \\"Kermit Vale,\\" which had appeared on his 1995 album. He contributed lead vocals to a few records by blues guitarist Kid Ramos - \\"I Would Be A Sinner\\" on Ramos‚Äô 1999 eponymous release, and \\"Love Don‚Äôt Love Nobody\\" on 2000‚Äôs West Coast House Party. For the 2002 Johnny Cash tribute album Dressed in Black, Intveld contributed a cover of the classic \\"Folsom Prison Blues.\\" In 2008, he released Have Faith on the Molenaart label, with the tracks \\"Pretty World\\", \\"This Place Ain¬¥t What It Used To Be\\", \\"Let¬¥s Get Started\\", \\"Something You Can¬¥t Buy\\", \\"A Woman¬¥s Touch\\", \\"Have Faith\\", \\"Motel Time\\", \\"If Tears Could Talk\\", \\"Small Town Boy\\", and \\"Walk With Me\\".

Intveld has appeared in a number of films, mostly in smaller, supporting roles such as co-starring with Billy Bob Thornton in Chrystal. Intveld lent his vocals to the titular character in John Waters' 1990 film Cry-Baby (with Cry-Baby being played onscreen by Johnny Depp), though left out of the main credits for this role, he is credited as the vocalist for all songs \\"performed\\" by the character. Intveld also appears in the George Strait music video, \\"The Seashores of Old Mexico\\". In 2005, Intveld turned from acting to directing in the form of Miracle at Sage Creek, starring David Carradine. He had previously directed a music video for Dale Watson.

In 1940, it was recorded by the Will Bradley Trio and became a top 10 hit in the closing months of the year. Called \\"a neat little amalgam of bluesy rhythm and vivid, catchy lyrics,\\" the song was subsequently recorded by a variety of jazz, blues, and rock artists. Original song \\"Down the Road a Piece\\" was recorded in 1940 by members of the Will Bradley‚ÄìRay McKinley Orchestra as the \\"Will Bradley Trio\\" (a misnomer, as Bradley did not perform on the song, while a fourth, the song's writer, Don Raye, did, as well as an uncredited vibraphone player). Three musicians are mentioned in the lyrics: \\"Eight Beat Mack\\" refers to the drummer Ray McKinley, \\"Doc\\" refers to the bass player Doc Goldberg, and \\"Beat Me Daddy Slack\\" refers to the pianist Freddie Slack (a reference to \\"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\\", a hit recorded earlier in 1940 by Slack with the Bradley‚ÄìMcKinley Orchestra). Vocals for \\"Down the Road a Piece\\" were provided by McKinley and Raye. Lyrics The original lyrics were used in cover versions by Harry Gibson and Stan Kenton, both in 1945, and the Glenn Miller Orchestra (led by Ray McKinley) in 1946, but subsequent recordings of \\"Down the Road a Piece\\" usually changed the lyrics that referred to the musicians. Amos Milburn recorded the song in 1946 and included the reference to \\"Eight Beat Mack\\" but changed the next line to \\"You remember me doggin' old Beat Me Daddy Slack.\\" Ella Mae Morse sang the song in the early 1950s, deleting the references to Doc and Slack from the lyrics and replacing them with \\"Sam and Spider-Finger Jack\\", but keeping the reference to Eight Beat Mack, in spite of the fact that McKinley was not in the band, but Slack was. In 1956, Merrill Moore sang \\"Eight Beat Joe ... Beat Me Daddy Moe\\". Chuck Berry, who recorded the song in 1960, changed the lyrics further, replacing the musicians with \\"Kicking McCoy, you remember the old rubber legged boy.\\" Berry's version was copied by Manfred Mann in 1964. The Rolling Stones in 1965 replaced Kicking McCoy with Charlie McCoy, probably a reference to Charlie Watts. Foghat, Brownsville Station, and Bruce Springsteen followed suit. Starting in the 1990s, however, most musicians began using the 1940 lyrics. Influence In his autobiography, Henry Mancini recalled that \\"Down the Road a Piece\\" inspired his \\"Baby Elephant Walk\\" for the 1961 movie Hatari!: \\"I looked at the scene [elephants walking to the watering hole] several times [and] I thought, 'Yeah, they're walking eight to the bar', and that brought something to mind, an old Will Bradley boogie-woogie number called 'Down the Road a Piece'... Those little elephants were definitely walking boogie-woogie, eight to the bar. I wrote 'Baby Elephant Walk' as a result\\". Numerous artists have recorded \\"Down the Road a Piece\\", sometimes with variations in the music. A partial list includes Chuck Berry, Brownsville Station, Foghat, Harry Gibson, Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers with Bruce Springsteen, Stan Kenton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Manfred Mann, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Amos Milburn, Merrill E.

Matches between the two nations are keenly contested and their games have a reputation for competitiveness. The football rivalry between Peru and Chile, partly a reflection of the geopolitical conflict between both neighboring states, is primarily a result of both football squads vying for recognition as the better team in South America's Pacific coast‚Äîas their football confederation is historically dominated by countries in South America's Atlantic coast.  History  A newspaper from Chile laments its national team's loss to Peru in their first-ever match The football rivalry between Chile and Peru has increased in intensity since the early twentieth century. Initially, the sports authorities from both countries attempted to use football as a way to foster friendly bilateral sociopolitical relations. In 1933, a private enterprise by businessmen Waldo Sanhueza and Jack Gubbins saw the creation of the Combinado del Pacifico, a binational football team composed by Peruvian and Chilean footballers. The squad was initially composed by players from the Chilean club Colo-Colo and the Peruvian club Universitario de Deportes. After this squad was defeated 1-5 by Alianza Lima, another football club from the Peruvian capital, the team was reinforced by Alianza's goalkeeper Juan Valdivieso and creative forward Alejandro Villanueva. Nowadays, Chile v. Peru games generally tend to be very competitive and at times rough, often with players sent off. The two teams display highly contested battles that make for entertaining matches within the CONMEBOL region. In spite of the fierce Chile- Peru football Rivalry, in 2013 The Chilean FA decided to include a new team in the 3rd Division for 2014 named Club Deportivo Incas del Sur which is a team that aims to represent the Peruvian Community in Santiago. Peruvian Companies in Chile have pledged to help fund the team. Currently the team aims to be in the Chilean top Division within three years.http://www.rpp.com.pe/2013-10-26-incas-del-sur-es-el-club-que- representara-a-los-peruanos-en-chile-noticia_642744.html In 2015, following a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match that resulted in a 3-4 Chilean victory over Peru in Lima, Chile's national team vandalized a dressing room in the Peruvian national stadium. The Chileans left behind a defiant message in the room's wall, \\"Respect! Through here passed America's champion!\\" (Respeto. Por aqu√≠ pas√≥ el campe√≥n de Am√©rica), alluding to their victory at the 2015 Copa Am√©rica.http://www.emol.com/noticias/Deportes/2017/11/16/883544/El-mensaje-de- la-Roja-en-el-camarin-El-motivo-por-el-que-Peru-le-dedico-a-Chile-su- clasificacion-al-Mundial.html In 2017, after Chile did not qualify to the World Cup finals, Chilean lawyers accused Peru of colluding with Colombia to eliminate Chile; a complaint later dismissed by FIFA.http://rpp.pe/futbol/seleccion-peruana/fifa-rechazo-el-reclamo-chileno- por-el-pacto-de-lima-entre-peru-y-colombia-noticia-1086521 When Peru reached the World Cup finals, after defeating New Zealand in the qualification play- offs, the Peruvian players celebrated with chants mocking Chile's elimination; an action deemed by El Mercurio, Chile's leading news outlet, as \\"provocative.\\"http://www.emol.com/noticias/Deportes/2017/11/16/883529/La- burlesca-y-provocadora-dedicatoria-de-Peru-a-Chile-en-los-festejos-por-su- clasificacion-al-Mundial.html  National team records  Peru's match against Chile at the 1975 Copa Am√©rica The national football teams of Chile and Peru have a rivalry that is known in Spanish as the Cl√°sico del Pac√≠fico (\\"Pacific Derby\\"). CNN World Sport editor Greg Duke ranks it among the top ten football rivalries in the world. The two countries traditionally compete with each other over the rank of fourth-best national team in South America (after Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay). They also both claim to have invented the bicycle kick; Peruvians call it the chalaca, while it is the chilena in Chile and the rest of Latin America. Both sides first faced each other in the 1935 South American Championship. Since 1953, both countries have traditionally contested the Copa del Pac√≠fico (\\"Pacific Cup\\"), which is a trophy awarded to the side with the best record after a two-legged home and away match. The first FIFA World Cup match between both teams took place in the qualification phase for the West Germany 1974 tournament. At present, Chile has a positive overall record against Peru in international football.  FIFA World Cup  In the FIFA World Cup tournament, Chile and Peru have only faced each other in the qualifying phase. The first time both sides played each other was in the qualification round for the West Germany 1974 tournament. Both teams were placed in CONMEBOL's Group 3, along with Venezuela. Following Venezuela's withdrawal from the tournament, the group became a contest between Peru and Chile. The first match was won by Peru on 29 April 1973.  Copa Am√©rica  Peru and Chile first faced each other in the 1935 South American Championship, with Alberto Montellanos scoring the only goal of the match within 5 minutes resulting in a 1‚Äì0 win for the Peruvians. The two sides have played each other 21 times throughout the tournament, with Peru having seven wins, Chile with eight, and six draws. Some notable matches include the 2015 semifinal, in which Carlos Zambrano was sent off after a tackle on Charles Ar√°nguiz, Eduardo Vargas scoring twice, and Gary Medel scoring an own goal in a 2‚Äì1 win for La Roja to see them advance to the final, in which they were victorious against Argentina 4‚Äì1 on spot kicks. The Peruvians would get their revenge four years later in 2019, in a 3‚Äì0 win, with Edison Flores scoring, Gabriel Arias coming off his line and making a disastrous mistake, allowing Yoshimar Yot√∫n to strike the ball into an empty net, and Paolo Guerrero tricking Arias to put in a third and send Los Incas into their first final since 1975.  Friendlies  The most recent friendly match between La Blanquirroja and La Roja was on 12 October 2018.

He was an advocate of deep mining. Charles Thomas was employed at Dolcoath Mine in Camborne from the age of 12 and nine years later was made an underground agent. By 1832 the mine's previously rich deposits of copper ore were substantially worked-out and the mine was in danger of closing. Thomas believed that rich deposits of tin ore would be found below the lowest levels of the mine, and tried to persuade the shareholders of this without success. However, in 1844, on the death of the manager, William Petherick, Thomas was appointed manager or \\"Captain\\" of the mine. Despite continued opposition from the shareholders, he persuaded a group of miners to work the lowest levels of the mine. These miners, known as \\"tributers\\", were paid solely on the basis of the ore they recovered, so the activity was undertaken at no threat to the shareholders. Good deposits of ore were quickly discovered and this helped Thomas raise the capital needed to deepen the mine further. In 1853 the first dividend was paid to the shareholders and Dolcoath went on to become the most productive tin mine in Cornwall.

It was originally hosted by Dennis Wholey, who was replaced by Jack Barry after ten episodes had aired. Fred Foy announced during the entire run. Two teams of three players competed - one composed of people under the age of thirty, the other being people over thirty. At least one member of each team was a well-known celebrity, occasionally playing against a relative on the other team. Gameplay Each team had to answer questions about the other's generation; for example, the under-30s might have to answer a question about the big bands, while the over-30s might have to answer a question about rock groups. Each round featured questions directed at each individual contestant worth $20 apiece. The other team could earn $5 for predicting whether their opponents could answer correctly. Shortly into the run, the prediction rule was discarded and each correct answer now scored $25. After all six players had each answered a question, the teams answered six Cross-Generation questions. Any player could buzz in, with a correct answer worth $10 but an incorrect answer deducting $10 from the team's earnings. The team who earned the most money after three rounds would have their winnings tripled (so that each contestant on that team would receive the team's final score). At least one question on each show involved a musical guest from either the past or present. Broadcast history The series was aired on Friday nights and first hosted by Wholey from the pilot through the tenth episode on April 11, 1969. Beginning the following week, he was replaced by Jack Barry in his first national hosting job since the quiz show scandals over a decade earlier forced him and his company out of the business. It was hoped that, if the show were a success in primetime, it would lead to a daytime slot. However, ratings were not strong enough and The Generation Gap ended after 16 episodes. Despite this, Barry's game show career was successfully revived, and he thanked ABC for the opportunity during his goodbyes on the last episode. Foreign versions The Generation Gap has not been revived in other countries, partly due to its short run. Despite its title, The Generation Game (which originally ran in the United Kingdom from 1971‚Äì1981 and hosted by Bruce Forsyth) was based on a 1969 Dutch show entitled Een van de acht (\\"One of the Eight\\"), which in turn used a stunt-based format much like that of Beat the Clock and Truth or Consequences. Revivals While not explicitly revived, the concept of \\"Juniors vs. Seniors\\" being over/under the age of thirty was later used on the 1984-1985 Mark Goodson series Trivia Trap. The 1998 VH1 series My Generation could be considered a revival due to a similar format and emphasis on music, which featured two teams of two people representing different years. The game was played for points, and the series used a Pyramid-esque bonus round for a prize package. Canadian youth channel YTV produced a game show of their own called Generation Gap hosted by Jeff Rechner which ran for a single season in 1989. This version was a stunt-based show which pitted a team of kids against a team of adults. However, beyond the title, it had very little to do with the original series. Episode status Unlike most other game shows of its era, all of the episodes of The Generation Gap have survived, including the 1968 pilot.UCLA Archive: The Generation Gap The first, eighth, and ninth episodes circulate among collectors.

Mitsumichi built Daian- zenji as a family memorial temple for the Matsudaira clan, the hereditary lords of Echizen\\"; retrieved 2013-4-9.. Biography Mitsumichi was born in Edo in 1636 as the second son of Matsudaira Tadamasa. His childhood name was Manchiyomaru. He became daimy≈ç of Fukui Domain on the death of his father in 1645. His Court rank was Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and courtesy title was Chamberlain. His courtesy title was raised to Sakonoue-gon-sh≈çsh≈ç in 1648. The Tokugawa shogunate took advantage of his youth to further reduce Fukui Domain in size by assigning 50,000 koku to his elder half-brother Masakatsu (childhood name Senkiku) to form Echizen-Matsuoka Domain, and 25,000 koku was given to his younger half- brother, Masachika (childhood name Tatsunosuke) to form Yoshie Domain. He underwent the genpuku ceremony in 1949, taking a kanji from the name of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu to become Matsudaira Mitsumichi. He was not permitted to leave Edo and visit his domain until 1653. During this period, and due to his youth, domainal affairs were overseen by senior retainers such as Honda Tomimasa, who had served the clan since the days of Y≈´ki Hideyasu. However, as these men were all very elderly, they began dying one by one, and Mitsumichi was soon able to commence a policy of personal oversight in the domain's government. Mitsumichi was famous as a wise lord, and enacted many legal codes which helped improve his domain's foundation and its economy, including rules for retainers on promotion of the martial arts and the maintenance of weapons. He also encouraged education, bringing in Confucian scholars from Kyoto and establishing academies.Kita, Sandy. (1999). The Last Tosa: Iwasa Katsumochi Matabei, Bridge to Ukiyo-e, p. 238. He is noted for building the large Zen temple of Daian-ji in Fukui as a mortuary temple for the Echizen-Matsudaira clan in 1658.. On the other hand, Fukui was continually beset by natural disasters, creating severe financial problems for the domain which would continue to plague it throughout its history. Mitsumichi, with permission of the shogunate, issued its own hansatsu in 1661, becoming the first domain to issue a paper currency. Gow, Ian. (2004). Military Intervention in Pre-War Japanese Politics, p. 16. In 1669, Fukui Castle along with much of the surrounding castle town was destroyed in a fire, and the domain was forced to borrow 50,00 ry≈ç from the shogunate for reconstruction. The donjon of the castle was never rebuilt due to lack of funds. Mitsumichi was married to his cousin, Kunihime (1636-1671), the daughter of Matsudaira Mitsunaga, daimy≈ç of Takada Domain. Kunihime was a noted waka poet, and had been sought after in marriage by the kuge nobles of Kyoto; however, there was political opposition by the shogunate, which was leery of possible collusion between the two powerful Matsudaira domains. Her marriage to Mitsumichi was delayed until 1655, when both were already 19 years old - considerably late for the marriage of the legitimate wife of a daimy≈ç. Kunihime had two daughters (both of whom died in infancy), and although relations with Mitsumichi were apparently good, there was tremendous pressure to produce a male heir. Mitsumichi took a concubine, Lady Osan, by whom he had a son (Matsudaira Naokata) and a daughter. This created a rift between Fukui and Takada, as his father-in-law Matsudaira Mitsunaga insisted that any heir should be by the legitimate wife (i.e. his daughter). Unable to bear the pressure and uncertain that she would be able to have more children at the age of 35, Kunihime committed suicide in 1671. The shogunate bowed to Matsudaira Mitsunaga's request, and declared that Matsudaira Naokata would not be allowed to succeed to Fukui Domain and would be exiled to ≈åno instead. All of these issues caused Mitsumichi to fall into severe depression. In 1674, he turned the domain over to his brother, Matsudaira Masachika, and committed suicide. His grave is at the temple of Daian-ji in Fukui which he created, and another grave was made at the clan's Edo temple of Kaian-ji in Shinagawa in 1877.

The Critic is an American 1963 short animated film by director/producer Ernest Pintoff and creator/narrator Mel Brooks, that won an Oscar for Short Subjects (Cartoons) in 1964.Shirley MacLaine presents Short Film Oscars¬Æ in 19641964Oscars.org Background The film was reportedly inspired by an actual incident. In 1962 Mel Brooks attended a screening of an animated short by Norman McLaren. It featured surrealistic, abstract imagery. During the screening of this short, Brooks overheard another audience member \\"mumbling to himself\\", an old immigrant man who was voicing his disappointment at the lack of a plot. Brooks was inspired to create a film out of this experience.Parish (2008), pp. 156-158 Brooks contacted Ernest Pintoff, who had experience producing animated works such as Flebus.Flebus (six-minute animated work on youtube.com) They agreed to create a short film based on two points: the visuals of the film had to be fashioned in a style similar to that of McLaren, and Brooks would have no specific warning of the content. He intended to improvise his monologue. Pintoff and animator Bob Heath completed the visuals as agreed, then Brooks watched the result and improvised his monologue for the accompanying soundtrack. He used a Russian Jewish accent and attempted to find lines appropriate for an old man \\"trying to find a plot in this maze of abstractions.\\" Henry Jenkins points that the comments themselves belong to a recognizable narrative mode, the stream of consciousness.Jenkins (2013), p. 151 Plot Simple, abstract, geometric shapes move and morph on the screen to harpsichord music, from a French Suite (BWV 816) by J. S. Bach. The voice of an audience member, who claims to be 71, complains throughout the film despite being told repeatedly by other audience members to keep quiet.Internet Archive The onscreen images feature geometric patterns. The \\"cranky and clueless\\" old man is trying to make sense of them, and describes what he sees at various points, including a squiggle, a fence, a cockroach. The old man finds that certain images remind him of the biology classes of his Russian boyhood. When two abstract shapes approach each other and unite, the old man sees it as a mating sequence. \\"...They like each other. Sure. Lookit da sparks. Two things in love!... Could dis be the sex life of two things?\\" When the scene shifts from the \\"mating\\" to other abstract images, the old man gets bored. He proclaims the images must be symbolism, then adds that they are symbolism of junk.Monaco (2009), pp. 434-435 He eventually concludes that some of the images, depicting lips, are \\"dirty\\", obscene.Weber (2003), p. 139 He admits at some point that he was looking for \\"a hot French picture\\", which he hoped would involve nudity. The implication is that the old man is in the wrong movie theater, probably one screening art films. He also wonders why the creator of the film wasted his time with this. He points that this creator could instead do something meaningful, like driving a truck, or do something constructive, like working in shoemaking. Analysis Mel Brooks came to prominence as a performer by playing the 2000 Year Old Man (1961). This \\"ancient Jewish gentleman\\" had a characteristic voice and manner of speaking; a \\"raspy\\", \\"gravelly\\" rambling voice with a Yiddish accent. To American audiences the accent implied a foreign-born background, German Jewish or Eastern European.Symons (2012), unnumbered pages In The Critic, Brooks serves as the narrator. He essentially reprises his role of the 2000 Year Old Man with minor variations. The tone of voice is \\"marginally deeper\\", the dialogue-style of the original role is replaced with a fragmented monologue. But otherwise there is little to set apart the two roles. Brooks voices a character who is heard but not seen onscreen. He is unnamed, identified only as an old man from Russia. The character is an audience member in a movie theater which is screening the film within a film. Said film is an experimental film, the product of avant-garde filmmaking. Clearly unfamiliar and unappreciative with such films, the old man delivers witty and insulting commentary. Donald Weber points that with his \\"contemptuous\\" common sense, the old man unmasks the pretensions of art criticism. James Monaco suggests that the film approaches matters of film criticism in a humorous way. When the old man complains about the two dollars he paid to see this worthless film, he is touching on two subjects: what does the film audience get for the money they spend on a film; how can the \\"cinematic value\\" of a film be determined? Monaco mentions the other film viewers, who seem to be enjoying the film within a film, which implies that there are subjective tastes when approaching a film, and consequently that the \\"cinematic value\\" is a matter of relative points of view. Kevin Murphy recalls the film as his introduction to the concept of riffing (MSTing). He describes the onscreen images as abstract pop-art animation, similar to that used in art classes and supposedly educational television. He describes the soundtrack as a droning and nondescript tune, somewhat reminiscent of Jazz and Baroque pop. And above them the voice of the old man provides riffing-style commentary, voicing what everybody else is thinking. He finds that the film addresses a key subject of audience reaction. The audience members have paid to see the work of an artist, and discovered that said work is \\"awful\\". Then why should they be expected to \\"just... sit there, shut up, and just take it?\\". They can instead start riffing, in an attempt to make their film-going experience at least \\"tolerable, fun\\".Murphy (2011), pp. 1-2 Release The film debuted on 20 May 1963, at New York City's Sutton Theater, on Manhattan's East Side. The film benefited by being screened for weeks alongside a popular British comedy, Heavens Above! (1963). The animated short received positive reviews by film critics, as a \\"spoof of the pseudo-art film\\". Positive reviews appeared in prominent newspapers such as The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune. The film reportedly won an assorted number of awards, including one from a film festival in West Germany and one from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 36th Academy Awards.

Cramer is an American historian, author, gun enthusiast, and software engineer. He played an important early role in documenting errors in the book Arming America by Michael A. Bellesiles, a book that was later proven to be based on fraudulent research. His work was cited by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in United States v. Emerson, 46 F.Supp.2d 598 (N.D.Tex. 1999). His research also informed the Supreme Court decision in the Second Amendment cases District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago. He holds an MA in history from Sonoma State University. He currently resides in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho, near Boise. Arming America controversy In 1996, while working on his master's thesis, Cramer read a paper by Bellesiles on early gun laws, published in the Journal of American History. This paper formed a basis for Bellesiles' later book, Arming America. Cramer's thesis \\"examined the development of concealed weapon laws in the early Republic\\", and he was struck by how Bellesiles' paper contradicted his own knowledge of gun availability in early America. However, at the time, Cramer attributed the contradiction to Bellesiles having picked differing sources from those that Cramer himself knew well. Cramer was later sent an early review copy of Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture. Upon reading it, Cramer immediately noted significant discrepancies with what he knew of American history, particularly at the time of the American Revolution. He began checking facts and discovered that many of Bellesiles' citations and quotes did not match the historical record. \\"I sat down with a list of bizarre, amazing claims that Bellesiles had made, and started chasing down the citations at Sonoma State University‚Äôs library. I found quotations out of context that completely reversed the author‚Äôs original intent. I found dates changed. I found the text of statutes changed ‚Äî and the changes completely reversed the meaning of the law. It took me twelve hours of hunting before I found a citation that was completely correct.\\" Cramer's research encountered resistance from journal editors and other historians, but he continued alleging fraud against Bellesiles' scholarship. Other historians, including James Lindgren of Northwestern University, supported Cramer's claims, and Emory University conducted an investigation which was strongly critical of Bellesiles' ethical standards. Bellesiles resigned his position at Emory on the day the report was released. On December 13, 2002, Bellesiles' Bancroft Prize was revoked by the Columbia University Board of Trustees. Other activities Cramer has written a regular column on gun owners' rights and related issues for Shotgun News. Clayton also manages an online blog titled ‚ÄòCivilian Gun Self-Defense Blog‚Äô which records civilian use of firearms in self-defense through citing news articles across the nation. He also manages a personal website and personal blog which includes links to his books, journal articles, and other publications. Cramer's scholarly papers can be found on the Social Science Resource Network. In 2008, Cramer ran for Idaho State Senator from District 22 as a Republican, but was defeated in the primary. Besides his research and publications on gun owners' rights and American history, Cramer also has a strong personal interest in the treatment of the mentally ill. He is critical of the recent policy of making involuntary commitment of seriously mentally ill persons extremely difficult, and has researched and compiled a book explaining the origins of this policy and its present-day effects. Cramer is also an avid amateur astronomer. He has developed a system of lockable wheels for heavy telescope mountings, which he dubbed \\"ScopeRoller\\".

They exist in tubes and discs. This procedure is popular among biohackers and grinders, but remains experimental.I.Harrison, K.Warwick and V.Ruiz (2018), \\"Subdermal Magnetic Implants: An Experimental Study\\", Cybernetics and Systems, 49(2), 122-150. Magnetic implants are often performed by amateurs at home, using readily available surgical tools and magnets found online. However, some professional body modification shops do perform implant surgeries. Magnetic implants can also be used as an interface for portable devices to create other new \\"senses\\", for example converting other sensory inputs such as ultrasonic or infra-red into a touch sensation. In this way the individual could 'feel' e.g. the distance to objects.J.Hameed, I.Harrison, M.Gasson and K.Warwick,‚ÄúA Novel Human-Machine Interface using Subdermal Magnetic Implants‚Äù, Proc. IEEE International Conference on Cybernetic Intelligent Systems, Reading, pp. 106-110, Sept. 2010  Purpose  Though magnetic implants can be used to pick up small metal objects, the main purpose of getting an implant is in order to gain sensory perception of magnetic fields. After a magnet is implanted underneath the epidermal layer of the skin, nerves grow around the magnet as the skin heals. The magnet pushes against magnetic fields produced by electronic devices in the surrounding area, pushing against the nerves and giving a \\"sixth sense\\" of magnetic vision. Some people prefer to have multiple implants in several fingers in order to get a more \\"3D\\" view of the magnetic fields around them, but one magnetic implant is enough to be able to feel magnetic fields. This means that people with magnetic implants have sensations of running electric motors, electronic circuits, appliances, and even wires.  Magnets and coatings  A magnet in the process of insertion into the tip of the ring finger The magnets used for implantation must be carefully selected and coated in order to successfully implant them. Size is important in this consideration, as too large of a magnet obstructs blood vessels and is likely to reject, or push out of the skin. For this reason, the most common magnet size is a 3√ó1mm neodymium disk magnet. Usually the magnets used are of the highest strength available, as a stronger magnet leads to higher magnetic field sensitivity. Perhaps the most important consideration is a coating for the magnet, as typical neodymium disk magnets are not suitable for implantation. Magnets must be coated in an inert and biosafe material, so the body does not attack the magnet. Popular magnet coatings include implant grade silicone, titanium nitride, gold and rhodium. Disc-magnets are implanted with a scalpel, tubes are inserted by syringe. Procedures are often done either without anaesthesia, or, in some cases, ice water, due to legal issues regarding purchase of anaesthesia versus usage of numbing substances such as alcohol or cold.  History  Magnet implantation was first theorized in the mid 1990s by Steve Haworth and Jesse Jarrel, both body modification experts. Initially, the implants were designed to connect to rings or horns outside of the body, and were purely cosmetic. However, after talking to a friend who had a piece of steel lodged into his finger which allowed him to sense the presence of magnetic fields, Haworth realised that small magnets could be implanted in order to achieve this effect more efficiently. Since then, several companies have sold bio-safe, implantable magnets.  Lifespan  Typical 3√ó1mm neodymium magnets have been reported to last on average five years implanted into finger extremities before body heat reduces the effectiveness of the implant. There have been no studies on magnetising implants after they have lost magnetisation other than removing and re- implanting a new magnet into a new site due to scar tissue formation preventing nerve sensation and reentry. There are three primary causes for magnets to lose sensitivity ‚Äì the ability for you to sense magnetic fields. Field strength decline The magnetic field strength of a magnet can naturally decline very slowly over many many years, however total losses are negligible and certainly not detectable without extremely sensitive field strength meters. That said there are direct causes which can affect magnetic field strength, such as forcing like poles together or severe mechanical impact. Forcing like poles together so the magnets repel each other can result in what‚Äôs called hysteresis loss, though it requires a considerably stronger opposing magnetic force to regularly act on your magnet to cause any significant loss to occur, which is unlikely. Severe impacts can physically jostle the atomic structure of the magnet, causing some magnetic domains to change direction or realign differently, causing some loss. Tactile nerve displacement Depending on the location of your magnetic implant, how your body heals, and how it develops scar tissue over time, you may begin to experience less tactile nerve activation over time as scar tissue slowly grows around the implant site, forcing tactile nerves further and further away from the implant. This does occur with some regularity, however it typically takes several years to be noticeable, and sensitivity loss is usually minor. More often than not, loss of sensitivity occurs due to corrosion of the magnet, either inside the encapsulation through or due to encapsulation failure. Corrosion Neodymium magnets contain a large amount of iron by volume, and iron is easily corroded by common elements such as oxygen and water. Magnet corrosion occurs when these elements become trapped inside during the encapsulation process, which can cause slow corrosive effect, or the encapsulation fails and allows corrosive elements to come into contact with the magnet. Catastrophic encapsulation failures are usually obvious, resulting in tenderness, discoloration of the skin, and a slight inflammatory response. Small failures however can take much longer to become obvious, resulting in a slow degradation of field strength without many external signs that something is slowly going wrong with the magnet.  Safety  Infection Infection has also been cited as a source of failure within RFID and related microchip implanted individuals.Schiffmann, Alain & Clauss, Martin & Honigmann, Philipp. (2020). Biohackers and Self-Made Problems: Infection of an Implanted RFID/NFC Chip: A Case Report. JBJS Case Connector. 10. e0399-e0399. 10.2106/JBJS.CC.19.00399. Either due to improper implantation techniques, implant rejections of corrosion of implant elements. MRI's Concern has been raised and investigated independently by various journalists and bodies on the nature of safety of being implanted and their proximity to MRI machines. So far no common conclusive investigation has been done in the matter of each individual type of implant and it's risks involved near MRI's other than anecdotal reports ranging from no problems occurring with MRI machines, to requiring hand shielding before proximity, to outright denial of proximity due to danger.  In Popular culture  Transhumanism is a movement related the implants and their relation to trans human qualities of which microchipped/sub-dermal implanted individuals are commonly grouped together with.

He edited several magazines, such as Izobrazitelnoye Iskusstvo among others, and was also co-founder of the Department of Iconography in the State Russian Museum. Punin was a lifelong friend and common-law husband of poet Anna Akhmatova who is famous for writing the poem Requiem. Biography=A key figure in the Russian art world Nikolay Punin was born in Helsingfors (now Helsinki), Grand Duchy of Finland, into the family of Nikolay Mikhaylovich Punin, a Medical Doctor of the Imperial Russian Army stationed in Helsingfors. Nikolay‚Äôs younger brother Leonid Punin was later to become a commander in the White armies. Young Punin moved to St. Petersburg and attended the classical gymnasium where he first met young student Anna Akhmatova. From 1907 to 1914, Punin attended the St. Petersburg University, studied history of art under professor Dmitry Aynalov, graduating in 1914, as an art historian, and began a career as an art critic and editor. Punin's involvement in such schools as Acmeism, Constructivism, Formalism, and other developments in art and culture, eventually made him one of the key figures in the Russian art world. Punin was among the first art critics who focused on the emerging new trends and styles. Punin's own multi-cultural exposure, as well as his diverse education and broad vision, made him the leading ideologist of the \\"Left Art,\\" embracing and representing many innovative and experimental movements. Punin was nicknamed a \\"Futurist\\" and a \\"Leftist\\" by both artists and historians. His circle of friends included artists Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, Vladimir Lebedev, Lev Bruni, Nikolai Tyrsa, and others. He welcomed the October revolution as an opportunity to establish new art. In 1917, Punin married Anna Arens, a physician; they had one daughter, Irina.Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center In 1918, Punin was appointed by Anatoli Lunacharsky to several important positions, such as the Head of the Petrograd Committee for Education (Narkompros), People's Commissar of the Russian Museum and the Hermitage Museum. For the next thirty years, Punin held several posts at the State Russian Museum. Union with Anna Akhmatova Nikolay Punin was in a civil union with poet Anna Akhmatova during the 1920s and 1930s. Punin and Akhmatova had much in common since the years of their youth, when both were students in Tsarskoye Selo. They had regular meetings since 1913, when both worked with the \\"Apollon\\" publishing in St. Petersburg. At that time Akmatova was married to Nikolay Gumilev, and Punin was a regular guest in their home during the 1910s. In 1922, Akmatova came to visit Punin at his home in the garden wing of the Sheremetyev Palace. She eventually moved in with Punin, and their relationship lasted fifteen years.Russian source: \\"The Keeper of the Future\\" The home of Punin and Akhmatova was a meeting place for the St. Petersburg's cultural milieu, and later became a museum of Anna Akhmatova. Akhmatova had saved Punin's life after his first arrest, in the 1930s, regardless that their relationship ended at that time. Punin was released after Anna Akhmatova's written petition to Joseph Stalin, but later he was arrested again. Nikolay Punin was twice arrested and imprisoned by the Soviet secret service under the dictatorship of Stalin.N. N. (Nikolai Nikolaevich) Punin. Diaries and correspondence Akhmatova was one of the few writers chosen to be flown out by Stalin, so Punin with her were transferred to Samarkand. Anna of All The Russians: The Life of Anna Akhmatova by Elaine Feinstein retrieved 13/8/2018 Under Stalin's dictatorship After arrest of Punin his former wife Akhmatova left the coat in its place as a memorial. It is still there, now in the Anna Akhmatova Literary and Memorial Museum In 1949 Punin was arrested on accusations of \\"anti-Soviet\\" activity, because he said that many thousands of Lenin's portraits are tasteless. The Soviet government punished Punin by imprisonment in the Gulag camp in Vorkuta, northern Russia. This time nobody could help Punin, because the intellectual elite of Leningrad was devastated by the Leningrad Affair. Most intellectuals who could help, were imprisoned, killed, exiled, or silenced by fear of Stalin's attacks. A secret file on Nikolay Punin was created with numerous accusations of his anti-Soviet activity. Most accusations were fabricated by various agents of the former Soviet KGB office in Leningrad, such as Lt. Prussakov, who accused \\"former professor of Leningrad University and Academy of arts, Punin\\" of \\"anti-Soviet\\" propaganda. Punin's popular lectures about European artists, such as Rembrandt and Impressionists were seen by the communists as evidence of his anti-Soviet activity. In 1953, just months after Stalin's death, Nikolay Punin died in the Gulag camp of Vorkuta, after spending the last four years of his life under harsh conditions of cold and hunger, in an old barrack crowded with two hundred prisoners lit by one light bulb. Legacy Punin was known as \\"savior of art collections\\" because he protected many valuable paintings of western artists, which were labeled \\"decadent bourgeois art\\" by the communist propaganda. In doing so, Punin took many risks by raising his voice in opposition to the Soviet officials. As curator of the Hermitage Museum and the Russian museum Punin saved many important masterpieces of art from destruction by revolutionary mob and undereducated communists. He was severely attacked by the Soviet communists for his efforts in preservation of \\"Western\\" art in Soviet museums. He was respected by artists and intellectuals as a key figure in Russian art history. Punin was also a remarkable lecturer; his lectures were extremely popular among open-minded members of the Soviet Academia, and among his numerous students.Russian source: –ù–ò–ö–û–õ–ê–ô –ù–ò–ö–û–õ–ê–ï–í–ò–ß –ü–£–ù–ò–ù (1888‚Äì1953) ‚Äì –ò–°–ö–£–°–°–¢–í–û–í–ï–î, –ü–ï–î–ê–ì–û–ì, –ú–£–ó–ï–ô–ù–´–ô –†–ê–ë–û–¢–ù–ò–ö.

Early life Maria was born in Kema, a small town in the regency of North Minahasa in the province of North Sulawesi. Her parents were Maramis and Sarah Rotinsulu. She had a Christian family. She was the youngest of three children with a sister by the name of Antje and brother by the name of Andries. Andries Maramis was the father of Alexander Andries Maramis who later became involved in the independence of Indonesia and held ministerial and ambassadorship positions in the Indonesian government. Maramis became an orphan at the age of six when her parents were both stricken with sickness and died one after the other in a short period of time. Maramis‚Äô uncle, Rotinsulu, took the children to Maumbi where he was the District Chief () and raised them after the death of their parents. Maria and her sister attended Malay school (). The name comes from the fact that the language used in the school was Malay language or an early term for the Indonesian language. The school taught basic knowledge, such as how to read and write, and some science and history. This would be the only formal education Maramis and her sister received as girls were expected to get married and become homemakers. PIKAT After moving to Manado, Maramis started writing op-eds in a local newspaper called Tjahaja Siang. In these articles, she argued the importance of the role of mothers in the family unit. She stressed that the care and health of the family were the responsibility of the mother. A child‚Äôs early education also came from the mother. Realizing the need to equip young women for their roles as caretakers of their families, Maramis with the help of a few others established an organization called ‚ÄúThe Love of a Mother toward her Children‚Äù () on July 8, 1917. The purpose of this organization was to teach women with elementary school level education family matters, such as cooking, sewing, infant care, and hand-crafting. Through the leadership of Maramis, PIKAT grew with the addition of branches around Minahasa, such as in Maumbi, Tondano, and Motoling. Branches in Java were also organized by local women in Batavia, Bogor, Bandung, Cimahi, Magelang, and Surabaya. On June 2, 1918, PIKAT opened a school in Manado. Maramis continued to be active in PIKAT until her death on April 22, 1924. To honor her contributions to the advancement of women in Indonesia, Maria Walanda Maramis was named a national hero () by the government of Indonesia on May 20, 1969. Voting rights of women in Minahasa In 1919, a regional representative body for Minahasa () was established. Its members were originally selected, but elections were planned to pick subsequent members through popular vote. Only men were given the opportunity to become representatives, but Maramis championed the rights of women to cast votes to choose these representatives. Her efforts reached Batavia (now known as Jakarta; then called Betawi in Indonesian) and in 1921 the Dutch allowed the participation of women in the elections of representatives for the Minahasa Raad. Family life Maramis married Joseph Frederick Caselung Walanda, a language teacher in 1890. After her marriage with Walanda, she became better known as Maria Walanda Maramis. They had three children. Two of the children were sent to teacher‚Äôs school in Betawi (Jakarta). Anna Matuli Walanda went on to become a teacher and also participated in PIKAT. Tribute On December 1, 2018, a Google Doodle was displayed to celebrate her 146th birthday. ReferencesBibliography * Manus, M. (1985). Maria Walanda Maramis.

He had several names during his lifetime, and is also credited with changing the spelling of the name of \\"Fukui\\" from <Á¶èÂ±Ö> to <Á¶è‰∫ï>. As Matsudaira Masaaki Masachika was born in 1640 as the 5th son of Matsudaira Tadamasa. HIs name in infancy was Fukumatsu (Á¶èÊùæ), which was later changed to Tatsunosuke (Ëæ∞‰πãÂä©). In 1645, when his brother Matsudaira Mitsumichi succeeded their father as daimy≈ç of Fukui Domain, Masachika received a fief of 25,000 koku and became daimy≈ç of the newly created Yoshie Domain. His name was changed to Matsudaira Masaaki (ÊòåÊòé) at that time. In 1651, he was granted the court rank was Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade and the courtesy title of Hy≈çbu-no-suke.The holdings of Yoshie Domain were scattered throughout Fukui Domain and were thus difficult to manage. Masaaki built a jin'ya in the village of Yoshie (now part of the city of Sabae) to be his headquarters; however, due to his youth, most affairs remained in the hands of his retainers. The domain built a residence in Edo in 1658. In 1664, his rank was raised to Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. As Matsudaira Masachika After Matsudaira Mitsumichi's suicide in 1674, Masaaki became daimy≈ç of Fukui, changing his name to Matsudaira Masachika. A succession dispute immediately arose, splitting the retainers of the domain into three factions, Mitsumichi had a biological son, Matsudaira Naokata, who had been born to a concubine, but who would normally have been considered heir. However, his succession was vehemently opposed by Matsudaira Mitsunaga, daimy≈ç of Takada Domain and the father of Mitsumichi's legitimate wife, Kunihime. Masachika also had an elder half-brother, Matsudaira Masakatsu, who was daimy≈ç of the larger Echizen-Matsuoka Domain, and who thus had a stronger claim. However, Mitsumichi had left a written will stating that Masachika was to be heir. The issue was settled when the kar≈ç Ashida Zush≈ç produced Mitsumichi's will and submitted it to the shogunate for its mediation. The shogunate ruled that Masachika was to be heir. At this time, Yoshi Domain was terminated, and its territory reabsorbed into the main Fukui landholdings. However, despite this settlement, there were many in the domain who remained unhappy with Masachika's succession, and so, after only two years as lord, he resigned in favor of Masakatsu's son Tsunamasa.DiCenzo, p. 216. Masachika resumed his former name of Matsudaira Masaaki. As Matsudaira Yoshinori Tsunamasa quickly proved to be a poor choice as daimy≈ç. He was a cruel lord, subject to frequent fits of rage, going on rampages and even killing retainers. He also neglected his duties at Edo Castle. His retainers called on Masaaki to step back in; however, the shogunate acted first and threatened the attainder of Fukui Domain in 1686. However, as Fukui was a famed domain founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu's son Y≈´ki Hideyasu, special consideration was given. Masachika and the domain's senior retainers were all called to Edo, and Tsunamasa was deposed. Fukui Domain was reduced by more than half, to a kokudaka of 250,000 koku, and Masachika was ordered to resume the position of daimy≈ç.Gow, Ian. (2004). Military Intervention in Pre-War Japanese Politics, pp. 16-17.. Furthermore, his courtesy titles were reduced in rank, and his seating during audiences in Edo Castle was reduced to the same room as the tozama daimy≈ç. Masachika struggled to recover from the damage created, and was forced to lay-off more than 2000 retainers due to the reduced size of the domain. He also promulgated several codes of laws for the domain in 1687 and 1691, to further regulate the behaviour of his officials and retainers, and to regulate shrine and temples. Echizen's famed washi paper became a domain monopoly. On the other hand, Fukui was continually beset by natural disasters, including flooding, which creating severe financial problems, which were made worse by the shogunate's ongoing punishment of Fukui by demanding that the domain assist in repairs on the stone walls of Edo Castle and by suddenly deciding to prohibit the domain from further issue of its own hansatsu Another issue which concerned Masachika was his lack of an heir. In 1690, he had initially adopted Matsudaira Masakata, the 5th son of M≈çri Tsunahiro of Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain. Masakata's grandmother had been a daughter of Y≈´ki Hideyasu, but there was opposition from the retainers, and so he set aside Masakata on the grounds of \\"poor health\\", and instead adopted Matsudaira Yoshikuni, Masakatsu's 6th son, as his heir in 1699. His courtesy title was elevated to Sakon'e-gon- sh≈çj≈ç. in 1696, and his seating during audiences was restored by the shogunate in 1702. He changed his name to Matsudaira Yoshinori in 1704. In 1710, Yoshinori retired to a villa he constructed outside of Fukui Castle, and died the following year at the age of 72. His grave is at the temple of Zuigan-ji in Fukui, and another grave was made at the clan's Edo temple of Kaian-ji in Shinagawa.

He played college football at Princeton University from 1882 to 1884 and was known as one of the greatest kickers in 19th century football. After his playing career ended, he remained active in the development of the game as a coach and founding member of football's rules committee. He was reported to have held a place in Princeton athletic history similar to that held by Walter Camp at Yale. Moffat was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971.  Early years  Moffat was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1862. He was the son of James C. Moffat, who was a professor at Princeton University for 40 years.  Football player  Moffat enrolled at Princeton and was a member of the Princeton Tigers football and baseball teams in the early 1880s. In baseball, he was Princeton's star pitcher for four years. In football, he played at the halfback position and developed a reputation as \\"probably the greatest kicker ever seen on a football field.\\" Football historian David M. Nelson credits Moffat with revolutionizing the kicking game in 1883 by developing the \\"spiral punt,\\" described by Nelson as \\"a dramatic change from the traditional end-over-end kicks.\\" Moffat has also been credited with inventing the drop kick, and kicked equally well with either foot. Moffat was a member of the Princeton football team from 1882 to 1884. As the team's senior captain in 1883, Moffat kicked 32 field goals in 15 games. In Princeton's 26 to 7 victory over Harvard in 1883, Moffat made five field goals, two drop kicks with his right foot, two drop kicks with his left foot, and one from placement.  Football official and coach  By profession, Moffat was a civil engineer. However, he remained an active and influential coach and official in the sport of football. Moffat was a member of football's Rules Committee for most of his adult life and, in that capacity, helped shape the game during its formative years. In October 1883, while still a student at Princeton, he was one of two Princeton representatives on an informal, seven- member rules committee that adopted the game's first modern scoring system‚Äî2 points for a touchdown, 4 points for a goal after touchdown, and 5 points for a field goal. In December 1893, with the game in turmoil as the result of deaths and serious injuries resulting from the game, a formalized Rules Committee was established consisting of Walter Camp of Yale, W. A. Brooks of Harvard, and Moffat as Princeton's representative. The New York Times urged the three men to \\"abolish mass plays and other brutal manoeuvres.\\" Moffat remained on the Rules Committee until his death in 1914. For many years, Moffat also served as an \\"advisory coach\\" to the Princeton football team. Contemporaneous records show that Moffat was active in coaching the team. For example, the undefeated 1896 team is listed as having \\"no coach\\", but a report published that fall in The Harvard Crimson noted that \\"Alexander Moffat '84 has charge of the team and is being assisted by Lea '96 and Morse '95.\\" According to an obituary, Moffat for many years after his graduation \\"acted as coach, umpire and referee and made practice of going to Princeton nearly every season to aid in the training of the football team.\\" Big Bill Edwards, who played at Princeton from 1896 to 1899, later wrote of Moffat: \\"His interest in the game was great, and he was always ready to give as much time as was needed to the coaching of the Princeton teams. His hard, efficient work developed remarkable kickers. He loved the game and was a cheerful, encouraging and sympathetic coach.\\" Moffat died from pneumonia at Presbyterian Hospital in New York City in 1914 at age 51. In 1971, Moffat was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Born in New Mexico, he played college football for the University of Michigan and Columbia University and was selected as an All-American in 1900 and 1901. Morley served as the head coach of the Columbia Blue and White football team from 1902 to 1905. He later returned to New Mexico where he was a successful cattle and sheep rancher. He was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1971. Early years Morley was born in 1876 at Cimarron in Colfax County, New Mexico. His parents were William Raymond Morley, Sr. (1846‚Äì1883), and Ada (McPherson) Morley (1852‚Äì1917). His father was the chief engineer for the Santa Fe Railroad and later edited The Cimarron News and managed the Maxwell land grant in Cimarron. Morley's father was killed in 1883 from an accidental shooting in Mexico. Morley was six years old at the time of his father's death. His father left extensive land holdings in the Datil Mountains near Datil, New Mexico. After his father's death, his mother remarried, and moved with her three young children (one boy and two girls) and her new husband, Floyd Jarrett, to the Datil Mountains. Jarrett abandoned the family in approximately 1889, and Morley's mother raised her children in a log house roofed with adobe sod. Morley's sister, Agnes Morley Cleaveland (1874‚Äì1958), later wrote a best-selling book titled \\"No Life for a Lady\\" about their life in the Datil Mountains.

Caspar Whitney, owner and editor-in-chief of the monthly Outing magazine, chose Morley as the captain and first-team halfback for his 1901 College Football All-America Team. In his review of the 1901 football season, Charles Edward Patterson wrote: \\"Morley, stocky, muscular, not to be denied his two yards help or no help (and three times two means six, or a first down, you know!) able to repeat indefinitely, the best interferer in present day football, a forty yard punter and a drop-kicker who can actually score.\\" In 1905, The New York Times recalled Morley's playing style at Columbia: \\"Morley was one of the most aggressive men who ever represented Columbia on the gridiron.

Division) was a unit of the Prussian/German Army.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as during the period of German unification (1866-1871) the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies and only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous. It was formed on October 11, 1866, and was headquartered in Kassel.G√ºnter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939.

The division was subordinated in peacetime to the XI Army Corps (XI. Armeekorps).Bredow, p. 587. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. Recruitment The division was recruited in the formerly independent Electorate of Hesse (Kurhessen), which had been incorporated into Prussia after the Austro- Prussian War, in the Principality of Waldeck, and in the Thuringian states. Until 1899, including during the Franco-Prussian War, it was predominantly from Thuringia, but many Thuringian units went to the 38th Division when that division was formed in 1899.Bredow, pp. 587-608.

In World War I, again as the 22nd Infantry Division, it fought initially on the Western Front, including in the Battle of Li√®ge. It was soon sent to the Eastern Front, where it remained until October 1917. It fought in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes and the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, as well as the Brusilov Offensive and Kerensky Offensive. After returning to the Western Front, it saw action in the 1918 German Spring Offensive, including the Second Battle of the Somme and the Second Battle of the Marne. Allied intelligence noted that the division had good morale, but in 1918 rated it third class, albeit better on the defensive.22\\\\.

Order of battle in the Franco-Prussian War During wartime, the 22nd Division, like other regular German divisions, was redesignated an infantry division. The organization of the 22nd Infantry Division in 1870 at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War was as follows:A.

Pre- World War I organization German divisions underwent various organizational changes after the Franco-Prussian War. With the creation of the 38th Division, most Thuringian elements were transferred to the new division and replaced with the Electorate of Hesse units (the 167th Upper Alsatian Infantry Regiment, despite its name, was recruited in the Electorate of Hesse and Prussian Saxony).

The sensationalist coverage of shark attacks began in early July following the Fourth of July weekend shark attack on 8-year-old Jessie Arbogast, and continued almost unabated‚Äîdespite no evidence for an actual increase in attacks‚Äîuntil the September 11 terrorist attacks shifted the media's attention away from beaches. The Summer of the Shark has since been remembered as an example of tabloid television perpetuating a story with no real merit beyond its ability to draw ratings.  Outline  The media's fixation with shark attacks began on July 6, when 8-year-old Mississippi boy Jessie Arbogast was bitten by a bull shark while standing in shallow water at Santa Rosa Island's Langdon Beach. The shark, which measured approximately in length, bit off Arbogast's arm in the attack; it was then caught and killed after being dragged by its tail onto shore by Arbogast's uncle, Vance Flosenzier. Although Arbogast was immediately pulled out the water by an unidentified bystander, the severe blood loss he suffered caused damage to his organs and brain, complicating his recovery. Arbogast's arm was later removed from the captured shark's mouth and surgically reattached. Immediately after the near-fatal attack on Arbogast, another attack severed the leg of a New Yorker vacationing in The Bahamas, while a third attack on a surfer occurred about a week later on July 15, six miles from the spot where Arbogast was bitten. In the following weeks, Arbogast's spectacular rescue and survival received extensive coverage in the 24-hour news cycle, which was renewed (and then redoubled) with each subsequent report of a shark incident. The media fixation continued with a cover story in the July 30th issue of Time magazine. In mid-August, many networks were showing footage captured by helicopters of hundreds of sharks coalescing off the southwest coast of Florida. Beach-goers were warned of the dangers of swimming, despite the fact that the swarm was probably part of an annual shark migration. The repeated broadcasts of the shark group has been criticized as blatant fear mongering, leading to the unwarranted belief of a so-called shark \\"epidemic\\". Two additional shark attacks, both fatal, occurred during the first three days of September -- one in Virginia and one in North Carolina. By early September, there were calls to pass legislation to help \\"control the problem.\\" The Summer of the Shark came to a quick end following the September 11 terrorist attacks, as the media had shifted attention to the destruction at the Pentagon, lower Manhattan and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Investigative journalist John Stossel explains the media's shark fixation in his book Give Me a Break, stating: > Instead of putting risks in proportion, we [reporters] hype interesting > ones. Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, and countless others called 2001 the \\"summer > of the shark.\\" [...] In truth, there wasn't a remarkable surge in shark > attacks in 2001. There were about as many in 1995 and 2000, but 1995 was the > year of the O.J. Simpson trial, and 2000 was an election year. The summer of > 2001 was a little dull, so reporters focused on sharks. Statistics In terms of absolute minutes of television coverage on the three major broadcast networks‚ÄîABC, CBS, and NBC‚Äîshark attacks were 2001's third \\"most important\\" news story prior to September 11, behind the western United States forest fires, and the political scandal resulting from the Chandra Levy missing persons case. However, the comparatively higher shock value of shark attacks left a lasting impression on the public. According to the International Shark Attack File, there were 76 shark attacks that occurred in 2001, lower than the 85 attacks documented in 2000; furthermore, although 5 people were killed in attacks in 2001, this was less than the 12 deaths caused by shark attacks the previous year.

It is a trajectory optimization that uses gravity to steer the vehicle onto its desired trajectory. It offers two main advantages over a trajectory controlled solely through the vehicle's own thrust. First, the thrust is not used to change the spacecraft's direction, so more of it is used to accelerate the vehicle into orbit. Second, and more importantly, during the initial ascent phase the vehicle can maintain low or even zero angle of attack. This minimizes transverse aerodynamic stress on the launch vehicle, allowing for a lighter launch vehicle. The term gravity turn can also refer to the use of a planet's gravity to change a spacecraft's direction in situations other than entering or leaving the orbit. When used in this context, it is similar to a gravitational slingshot; the difference is that a gravitational slingshot often increases or decreases spacecraft velocity and changes direction, while the gravity turn only changes direction. Launch procedure=Vertical climb A diagram showing the velocity vectors for times t and t+1 during the vertical climb phase. The launch vehicle's new velocity is the vector sum of its old velocity, the acceleration from thrust, and the acceleration of gravity. More formally V_{t+1} = V_{t} + ( a_\\\\text{thrust} + a_\\\\text{gravity} ) \\\\cdot \\\\Delta t A gravity turn is commonly used with rocket powered vehicles that launch vertically, like the Space Shuttle. The rocket begins by flying straight up, gaining both vertical speed and altitude. During this portion of the launch, gravity acts directly against the thrust of the rocket, lowering its vertical acceleration. Losses associated with this slowing are known as gravity drag, and can be minimized by executing the next phase of the launch, the pitchover maneuver, as soon as possible. The pitchover should also be carried out while the vertical velocity is small to avoid large aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during the maneuver. The pitchover maneuver consists of the rocket gimbaling its engine slightly to direct some of its thrust to one side. This force creates a net torque on the ship, turning it so that it no longer points vertically. The pitchover angle varies with the launch vehicle and is included in the rocket's inertial guidance system. For some vehicles it is only a few degrees, while other vehicles use relatively large angles (a few tens of degrees). After the pitchover is complete, the engines are reset to point straight down the axis of the rocket again. This small steering maneuver is the only time during an ideal gravity turn ascent that thrust must be used for purposes of steering. The pitchover maneuver serves two purposes. First, it turns the rocket slightly so that its flight path is no longer vertical, and second, it places the rocket on the correct heading for its ascent to orbit. After the pitchover, the rocket's angle of attack is adjusted to zero for the remainder of its climb to orbit. This zeroing of the angle of attack reduces lateral aerodynamic loads and produces negligible lift force during the ascent. Downrange acceleration A diagram showing the velocity vectors for times t and t+1 during the downrange acceleration phase. As before, the launch vehicle's new velocity is the vector sum of its old velocity, the acceleration from thrust, and the acceleration of gravity. Because gravity acts straight down, the new velocity vector is closer to being level with the horizon; gravity has \\"turned\\" the trajectory downward. After the pitchover, the rocket's flight path is no longer completely vertical, so gravity acts to turn the flight path back towards the ground. If the rocket were not producing thrust, the flight path would be a simple ellipse like a thrown ball (it's a common mistake to think it is a parabola: this is only true if it is assumed that the Earth is flat, and gravity always points in the same direction, which is a good approximation for short distances), leveling off and then falling back to the ground. The rocket is producing thrust though, and rather than leveling off and then descending again, by the time the rocket levels off, it has gained sufficient altitude and velocity to place it in a stable orbit. If the rocket is a multi-stage system where stages fire sequentially, the rocket's ascent burn may not be continuous. Obviously, some time must be allowed for stage separation and engine ignition between each successive stage, but some rocket designs call for extra free-flight time between stages. This is particularly useful in very high thrust rockets, where if the engines were fired continuously, the rocket would run out of fuel before leveling off and reaching a stable orbit above the atmosphere. The technique is also useful when launching from a planet with a thick atmosphere, such as the Earth. Because gravity turns the flight path during free flight, the rocket can use a smaller initial pitchover angle, giving it higher vertical velocity, and taking it out of the atmosphere more quickly. This reduces both aerodynamic drag as well as aerodynamic stress during launch. Then later during the flight the rocket coasts between stage firings, allowing it to level off above the atmosphere, so when the engine fires again, at zero angle of attack, the thrust accelerates the ship horizontally, inserting it into orbit. Descent and landing procedure Because heat shields and parachutes cannot be used to land on an airless body such as the Moon, a powered descent with a gravity turn is a good alternative. The Apollo Lunar Module used a slightly modified gravity turn to land from lunar orbit. This was essentially a launch in reverse except that a landing spacecraft is lightest at the surface while a spacecraft being launched is heaviest at the surface. A computer program called Lander that simulated gravity turn landings applied this concept by simulating a gravity turn launch with a negative mass flow rate, i.e. the propellant tanks filled during the rocket burn. The idea of using a gravity turn maneuver to land a vehicle was originally developed for the Lunar Surveyor landings, although Surveyor made a direct approach to the surface without first going into lunar orbit. Deorbit and reentry The deorbit, coast, and possible reentry phase leading up to the beginning of the final landing burn. The vehicle begins by orienting for a retrograde burn to reduce its orbital velocity, lowering its point of periapsis to near the surface of the body to be landed on. If the craft is landing on a planet with an atmosphere such as Mars the deorbit burn will only lower periapsis into the upper layers of the atmosphere, rather than just above the surface as on an airless body. After the deorbit burn is complete the vehicle can either coast until it is nearer to its landing site or continue firing its engine while maintaining zero angle of attack. For a planet with an atmosphere the coast portion of the trip includes reentry through the atmosphere as well. After the coast and possible reentry the vehicle jettisons any no longer necessary heat shields and/or parachutes in preparation for the final landing burn. If the atmosphere is thick enough it can be used to slow the vehicle a considerable amount, thus saving on fuel. In this case a gravity turn is not the optimal entry trajectory but it does allow for approximation of the true delta-v required. In the case where there is no atmosphere however, the landing vehicle must provide the full delta-v necessary to land safely on the surface. Landing The final approach and landing portion of the descent. The vehicle loses horizontal speed while transitioning to a vertical hover, allowing it to settle down on the surface. If it is not already properly oriented, the vehicle lines up its engines to fire directly opposite its current surface velocity vector, which at this point is either parallel to the ground or only slightly vertical, as shown to the left. The vehicle then fires its landing engine to slow down for landing. As the vehicle loses horizontal velocity the gravity of the body to be landed on will begin pulling the trajectory closer and closer to a vertical descent. In an ideal maneuver on a perfectly spherical body the vehicle could reach zero horizontal velocity, zero vertical velocity, and zero altitude all at the same moment, landing safely on the surface (if the body is not rotating; else the horizontal velocity shall be made equal to the one of the body at the considered latitude). However, due to rocks and uneven surface terrain the vehicle usually picks up a few degrees of angle of attack near the end of the maneuver to zero its horizontal velocity just above the surface. This process is the mirror image of the pitch over maneuver used in the launch procedure and allows the vehicle to hover straight down, landing gently on the surface. Guidance and control The steering of a rocket's course during its flight is divided into two separate components; control, the ability to point the rocket in a desired direction, and guidance, the determination of what direction a rocket should be pointed to reach a given target. The desired target can either be a location on the ground, as in the case of a ballistic missile, or a particular orbit, as in the case of a launch vehicle. Launch The gravity turn trajectory is most commonly used during early ascent. The guidance program is a precalculated lookup table of pitch vs time. Control is done with engine gimballing and/or aerodynamic control surfaces. The pitch program maintains a zero angle of attack (the definition of a gravity turn) until the vacuum of space is reached, thus minimizing lateral aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. (Excessive aerodynamic loads can quickly destroy the vehicle.) Although the preprogrammed pitch schedule is adequate for some applications, an adaptive inertial guidance system that determines location, orientation and velocity with accelerometers and gyroscopes, is almost always employed on modern rockets. The British satellite launcher Black Arrow was an example of a rocket that flew a preprogrammed pitch schedule, making no attempt to correct for errors in its trajectory, while the Apollo- Saturn rockets used \\"closed loop\\" inertial guidance after the gravity turn through the atmosphere. The initial pitch program is an open-loop system subject to errors from winds, thrust variations, etc. To maintain zero angle of attack during atmospheric flight, these errors are not corrected until reaching space. Then a more sophisticated closed-loop guidance program can take over to correct trajectory deviations and attain the desired orbit. In the Apollo missions, the transition to closed-loop guidance took place early in second stage flight after maintaining a fixed inertial attitude while jettisoning the first stage and interstage ring. Because the upper stages of a rocket operate in a near vacuum, fins are ineffective. Steering relies entirely on engine gimballing and a reaction control system. Landing To serve as an example of how the gravity turn can be used for a powered landing, an Apollo type lander on an airless body will be assumed. The lander begins in a circular orbit docked to the command module. After separation from the command module the lander performs a retrograde burn to lower its periapsis to just above the surface. It then coasts to periapsis where the engine is restarted to perform the gravity turn descent. It has been shown that in this situation guidance can be achieved by maintaining a constant angle between the thrust vector and the line of sight to the orbiting command module. This simple guidance algorithm builds on a previous study which investigated the use of various visual guidance cues including the uprange horizon, the downrange horizon, the desired landing site, and the orbiting command module. The study concluded that using the command module provides the best visual reference, as it maintains a near constant visual separation from an ideal gravity turn until the landing is almost complete. Because the vehicle is landing in a vacuum, aerodynamic control surfaces are useless. Therefore, a system such as a gimballing main engine, a reaction control system, or possibly a control moment gyroscope must be used for attitude control. Limitations Although gravity turn trajectories use minimal steering thrust they are not always the most efficient possible launch or landing procedure. Several things can affect the gravity turn procedure making it less efficient or even impossible due to the design limitations of the launch vehicle. A brief summary of factors affecting the turn is given below. *Atmosphere ‚Äî In order to minimize gravity drag the vehicle should begin gaining horizontal speed as soon as possible. On an airless body such as the Moon this presents no problem, however on a planet with a dense atmosphere this is not possible. A trade-off exists between flying higher before starting downrange acceleration, thus increasing gravity drag losses; or starting downrange acceleration earlier, reducing gravity drag but increasing the aerodynamic drag experienced during launch. *Maximum dynamic pressure ‚Äî Another effect related to the planet's atmosphere is the maximum dynamic pressure exerted on the launch vehicle during the launch. Dynamic pressure is related to both the atmospheric density and the vehicle's speed through the atmosphere. Just after liftoff the vehicle is gaining speed and increasing dynamic pressure faster than the reduction in atmospheric density can decrease the dynamic pressure. This causes the dynamic pressure exerted on the vehicle to increase until the two rates are equal. This is known as the point of maximum dynamic pressure (abbreviated \\"max Q\\"), and the launch vehicle must be built to withstand this amount of stress during launch. As before a trade off exists between gravity drag from flying higher first to avoid the thicker atmosphere when accelerating; or accelerating more at lower altitude, resulting in a heavier launch vehicle because of a higher maximum dynamic pressure experienced on launch. *Maximum engine thrust ‚Äî The maximum thrust the rocket engine can produce affects several aspects of the gravity turn procedure. Firstly, before the pitch over maneuver the vehicle must be capable of not only overcoming the force of gravity but accelerating upwards. The more acceleration the vehicle has beyond the acceleration of gravity the quicker vertical speed can be obtained allowing for lower gravity drag in the initial launch phase. When the pitch over is executed the vehicle begins its downrange acceleration phase; engine thrust affects this phase as well. Higher thrust allows for a faster acceleration to orbital velocity as well. By reducing this time the rocket can level off sooner; further reducing gravity drag losses. Although higher thrust can make the launch more efficient, accelerating too much low in the atmosphere increases the maximum dynamic pressure. This can be alleviated by throttling the engines back during the beginning of downrange acceleration until the vehicle has climbed higher. However, with solid fuel rockets this may not be possible. *Maximum tolerable payload acceleration ‚Äî Another limitation related to engine thrust is the maximum acceleration that can be safely sustained by the crew and/or the payload. Near main engine cut off (MECO) when the launch vehicle has consumed most of its fuel it will be much lighter than it was at launch. If the engines are still producing the same amount of thrust, the acceleration will grow as a result of the decreasing vehicle mass. If this acceleration is not kept in check by throttling back the engines, injury to the crew or damage to the payload could occur. This forces the vehicle to spend more time gaining horizontal velocity, increasing gravity drag. Use in orbital redirection For spacecraft missions where large changes in the direction of flight are necessary, direct propulsion by the spacecraft may not be feasible due to the large delta-v requirement. In these cases it may be possible to perform a flyby of a nearby planet or moon, using its gravitational attraction to alter the ship's direction of flight. Although this maneuver is very similar to the gravitational slingshot it differs in that a slingshot often implies a change in both speed and direction whereas the gravity turn only changes the direction of flight. A variant of this maneuver, the free return trajectory allows the spacecraft to depart from a planet, circle another planet once, and return to the starting planet using propulsion only during the initial departure burn. Although in theory it is possible to execute a perfect free return trajectory, in practice small correction burns are often necessary during the flight. Even though it does not require a burn for the return trip, other return trajectory types, such as an aerodynamic turn, can result in a lower total delta-v for the mission. Use in spaceflight Many spaceflight missions have utilized the gravity turn, either directly or in a modified form, to carry out their missions. What follows is a short list of various mission that have used this procedure. *Surveyor program ‚Äî A precursor to the Apollo Program, the Surveyor Program's primary mission objective was to develop the ability to perform soft landings on the surface of the moon, through the use of an automated descent and landing program built into the lander. Although the landing procedure can be classified as a gravity turn descent, it differs from the technique most commonly employed in that it was shot from the Earth directly to the lunar surface, rather than first orbiting the moon as the Apollo landers did. Because of this the descent path was nearly vertical, although some \\"turning\\" was done by gravity during the landing. *Apollo program ‚Äî Launches of the Saturn V rocket during the Apollo program were carried out using a gravity turn in order to minimize lateral stress on the rocket. At the other end of their journey, the lunar landers utilized a gravity turn landing and ascent from the Moon. Mathematical description The simplest case of the gravity turn trajectory is that which describes a point mass vehicle, in a uniform gravitational field, neglecting air resistance. The thrust force \\\\vec{F} is a vector whose magnitude is a function of time and whose direction can be varied at will. Under these assumptions the differential equation of motion is given by: :m \\\\frac{d \\\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\\\vec{F} - mg \\\\hat{k}\\\\;. Here \\\\hat{k} is a unit vector in the vertical direction and m is the instantaneous vehicle mass. By constraining the thrust vector to point parallel to the velocity and separating the equation of motion into components parallel to \\\\vec{v} and those perpendicular to \\\\vec{v} we arrive at the following system: \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{v} &= g(n - \\\\cos{\\\\beta}) \\\\;,\\\\ v \\\\dot{\\\\beta} &= g \\\\sin{\\\\beta}\\\\;. \\\\ \\\\end{align} Here the current thrust to weight ratio has been denoted by n = F/mg and the current angle between the velocity vector and the vertical by \\\\beta = \\\\arccos{(\\\\vec{\\\\tau_1} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{k})}. This results in a coupled system of equations which can be integrated to obtain the trajectory. However, for all but the simplest case of constant n over the entire flight, the equations cannot be solved analytically and must be integrated numerically.

Geography Hyde Park is located on the north side of Memphis, Tennessee, starting around the intersection of Hyde Park St. and Chelsea Ave. Hyde Park lies near the Hollywood community and borders another North Memphis neighborhood known as Douglass. Community Hyde Park is known for its long strip down Hollywood Street that is often a lively meeting place. Almost all commercial businesses in the area are located on Hollywood Street or Chelsea Avenue. Shannon Elementary School Shannon Elementary School, located at 2248 Shannon Road, is the only elementary school within the perimeters of Hyde Park. The school serves grades PK-5 formerly in the Memphis City Schools district and was an Shelby County Schools campus. The school is admitted to be served by an charter school district called \\"KIPP Academy\\". Cypress Middle School Cypress Middle School, located at 2109 Howell Street, was the only middle school in Hyde Park. The school is formerly operated by the Memphis City Schools and was a campus school in the Shelby County Schools before submitting it's charter to KIPP. The school serves about 450 students in grades 6‚Äì8. After the 2013‚Äì14 school year, the board decided to close the school down. Now the former building is used for Kipp Academy. Douglass & Manassas High Schools There are no high schools located within Hyde Park. Students attend neighboring Douglass High School and Manassas High School. Douglass is named after the 19th Century African-American abolitionist Fredrick Douglass. The school opened in 1946, and boasts several graduating scholars, a world-renowned band and championship sports teams. The court- ordered cross-town busing of the 1970s, and low enrollment, led to the school closing in 1981. The abandoned building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, but was torn down in 2006 to be replaced by a new building. The new building was started in 2006 and the new Douglass High School opened to students in fall 2008. In May 2010, the school had its first graduating class since 1981. DHS has an active alumni association with more than 500 members in seven chapters across the United States. Rev. William Young established Manassas in 1899. The original Manassas building was a two- room frame structure erected on the west side of Manassas Street, north of Belt Line. In 1909, Mrs. Cora Taylor was appointed principal. Under her leadership, Manassas purchased a tract of land located across the street. In 1921, a two-story frame building was added. A high school grade was added every year until Manassas graduated its first class of 14 members in 1924. Manassas was the first four-year accredited Negro high School in Shelby County. It had the first Negro football team in the city. The success of athletic teams of Manassas can be seen in the trophies on display in the trophy case in the hall near the Main Office. An auditorium with twelve hundred seats was completed in 1924 and a new 50-room modern structure added to the auditorium in 1938. Mr. Louis B. Hobson became the new principal after Mr. Hayes retired in 1953. Mr. Hobson fostered many outstanding educational programs during his 25 years of service with the belief that all students had the ability to obtain greatness. Manassas was further recognized for its students‚Äô superior academic achievements in Mr. Hobson's administration. The integration of the faculty and student body in Manassas happened around 1974. Mr. Robert S., a young enthusiastic educator, become principal of Manassas High School in 1982. Mr. White accomplished many innovations for Manassas: French was added to the curriculum; advanced courses were added in math and science; Four computer labs were established; Manassas was paired with Trezevant Vocational School in an effort to improve vocational offering. During 1996 and 2001 the staff adopted three schoolwide programs: The Instructional Reform Models, The Middle School Initiative, The Ninth Grade Academy, and High Schools That Work involved all students in a challenging curriculum designed to improve student performance. Manassas changed from a middle/high school to a full-fledged high school with grades nine through twelve during 2001‚Äì2002. A vote by the entire Memphis City School Board of Commissioners approved construction of a new school in 2004 and the official groundbreaking ceremony was held on Dec. 13, 2005. The new school officially opened on Jan.7, 2008 on Manassas Street, where it originated in 1899. An Alumni Archive and a library are located in the new school. Parks There are many parks in the Hyde Park Community. They are listed as follows: Gooch Park is located on University Street and Hunter Avenue. It is a plot of land donated to the community by Cecil Milton Gooch (1889-1969), a retired lumber company owner during that time. The park is also named after Gooch, and it was dedicated to him on November 24, 1957. Gooch Park was also the location of the first African American bicycle derby in Memphis. Today, Gooch Park has a swimming pool, pavilion, three outdoor basketball courts, and play equipment. Guthrie Park is located on Chelsea Avenue and Decatur Street. Located on this park is Guthrie Elementary School, which was founded in 1915. Near this park is also the Dave Wells Community Center. One of the most notable people to visit the center was Elvis Presley, who played football with some friends there on December 27, 1956. University Park is located on University Street and Edward Avenue, approximately two blocks away from Gooch Park. University Park is behind Cypress Middle School. It is and includes play equipment, four tennis courts, and a ball field. Hollywood Park is located at 1560 N. Hollywood. It is and includes an indoor basketball court, play equipment, and a ball field. The Hollywood Community Center is also located there. Cypress Creek Cyprus Creek is a small creek running through North Memphis, originating east of the Memphis fairgrounds and running north until emptying into McKellar Lake. It is an important asset for water drainage and flood control. It has also been the dumping sites of several harmful chemicals. Velsicol was the main target of the court cases involving Cyprus Creek and according to them site investigations and remediation have been completed at all residential areas along the street, with the exception of Springdale Apartments. During the channelization process in the 1960s, contaminated sediment was displaced into residents‚Äô backyards and placed on the grounds of local schools. In March 2005, the Tennessee Department of Health conducted tests requested by the Memphis and Shelby County Health Department to examine the levels of toxicity in the creek and the exposure and risk to those living around it. Velsicol Chemical Corporation took its own soil samples and discovered instances of the pesticide aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and endrin- like chemicals, all of which were produced at the Velsicol plant. However, while Tennessee Department of Health concluded that pesticides in most yards were not hazardous to residents‚Äô health, they also found that in some yards pesticides may have presented a health hazard in the past and may continue to be in the present and future. The Tennessee Department of Health has recommended that the appropriate government bodies assure the swift cleanup of properties requiring remediation, and that all areas filled with soil from Cypress Creek should be located and tested. In addition, Velsicol is responsible for removing soil from contaminated residential properties, landscaping the property under the guidance of the property owner, and storing the contaminated soil on the Velsicol property before it can be disposed of. Once this process is complete, Velsicol must address non-residential properties adversely affected by the company's dumping. On April 1, 2004, certain residents of the Cypress Creek neighborhood of Memphis filed a lawsuit against Velsicol Chemical Corporation, alleging damage to their property from the discharge of dieldrin and related chemicals from the Velsicol plant on Warford Avenue to Cypress Creek. Mildred Isabel et al. v. Velsicol Chemical Corporation. The Creek has also been rumored to cause birth defects in the babies of parents living near the creek, and this was one of the arguments that the plaintiffs had against Velsicol. After investigation, it was determined that this was not the case, though cancer rates are still higher in the neighborhood. Community centers There are a few locations in Hyde Park that are central to the community. There is the Shasta Community Center, Hollywood community center, as well as the Hollywood library. The Hollywood Community Center contains a weight-lifting room, a gymnasium, and meeting and multi-purpose rooms. The center offers several classes, some of which are: fitness, youth basketball, educational development, GED programs, dance and music, as well as many more cultural, physical, and mental development programs and activities. It is open Monday through Saturday and is a vital location in the community, especially for the youth and seniors. Next door to the community center is the Hollywood branch of the Memphis public library system. Along with over 23,000 printed materials, they are also working on their collection of audio and video files for the community to enjoy. Along with these assets, the library offers computers with access to internet and word processing, a job and career center, meeting room, and special event programming. People all over Hyde Park come to the library in order to use its services. Shasta Central Shasta Central is an actively engaged community center located in the heart of Hyde Park at 2375 Shasta Avenue, a few blocks away from Cypress Creek and Cypress Middle School. Opened in March 2005 by a partnership between Rhodes College and Dorothy Cox, an active member of the community, employee of Rhodes, and director of the center, Shasta Central stands as a symbol of hopeful progress within the community and an extension of Ms. Cox's non-profit, Community Mentoring Outreach Services, Inc. Ms. Cox's mission of hope and confidence, of discovering, utilizing, and enhancing community assets as well as holding residents and government accountable for their equal share of responsibility, is reflected in the efforts and successes implemented by Shasta Central. According to an article published by Rhodes Magazine, several changes have occurred in Hyde Park because of Shasta Central's involvement.

It is sold in approximately 40 countries for anxiety disorders, without the sedation and ataxia associated with benzodiazepine drugs. It has similar anxiolytic effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct, although it has structural elements in common with them. Studies suggest is as effective as lorazepam as an anxiolytic, but has fewer side effects. Etifoxine is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency. Side effects The most common adverse effect of etifoxine is mild drowsiness at initial dosing. It is not associated with any withdrawal syndromes or dependence. Etifoxine shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and withdrawal syndromes than those of benzodiazepines. A 2012 review of etifoxine by the French National Pharmacovigilance Committee determined that etifoxine was safe and continued to provide a favorable alternative to benzodiazepine anxiolytics. The committee found (for a ten-year pharmacovigilance period) that safety concerns were rare or very rare and that the incidence of idiosyncratic hepatic problems were very rare. Mechanism of action Unlike benzodiazepines, etifoxine may produce its anxiolytic effects through a dual mechanism, by directly binding to GABAA receptors and (purportedly, exact binding site undetermined) to the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO), resulting in increases in endogenous neurosteroids. At GABAA receptors etifoxine binds at the Œ±+Œ≤‚àí interface and preferentially potentiates Œ±2Œ≤3Œ≥2 and Œ±3Œ≤3Œ≥2 receptor types. This direct allosteric potentiation can only be observed at relatively high concentrations (starting at > 1 micromolar) and is perhaps not physiologically relevant at normal human doses. This is different than benzodiazepines and etifoxine can be used alongside benzodiazepines to potentiate their effects without competing for binding sites; however, it also means that the direct effects of etifoxine are not reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Etifoxine stimulates the biosynthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, for example: allopregnanolone (3-alpha,5-alpha THP), a nanomolar potentiator of GABA activity.
