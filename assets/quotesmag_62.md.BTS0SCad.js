The district is nationally significant for the remarkably unified and well-preserved street plan, architecture, and public infrastructure, one of the largest such concentrations in the nation. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Description and history The area that is now Marshall was settled in 1831 by Sidney Ketchum, a land speculator from New York who envisioned it as a future capital city for the future state of Michigan. He chose the site for its location on the Kalamazoo River and its proximity to the main road between Detroit and Chicago. The city was settled over the next decade by well-educated migrants from the northeastern United States, who brought with them a sense of building architecture and town planning from the region. The city was laid out in a rectilinear grid, and the early buildings were typically Greek Revival, some in a sophisticated high style. Growth was at first fueled by the belief that the community would be chosen as the state capital, but Lansing was chosen in 1847. Later growth came courtesy of industry and railroad transportation links, including the main rail yard of the Michigan Central Railroad. The city's economic prosperity continued until the 1870s, when the Michigan Central closed its rail yard. During this period, construction continued apace, with high-quality but often conservative versions of the popular Italianate and Gothic Revival styles. In the early 20th century, the city continued at a lower level of prosperity, but the level of architectural quality of new Colonial and Classical Revival buildings continued to be high. The effect of this growth is that there is now a high quality cross-section of architectural styles of the 19th and early 20th centuries, including residential, civic, commercial, and religious buildings. The historic district designated in 1991 is about in size, and includes more than 750 historically significant buildings. It is roughly bounded on the north by Forest Street, the west by Plum Street, the south by Hanover Street, and the east by East Drive. This area includes the historic commercial, civic, and residential core of the city. Particularly notable buildings include the Hawaiian-inspired Italianate Honolulu House, the National House, an 1835 Greek Revival inn, and Wagner's Block, an imposing commercial Second Empire block on West Michigan Avenue.

Born Keith Joseph Lane in Sydney, Australia, he first heard bebop whilst in the army in 1947. After leaving the army he studied with conductor and teacher of advanced harmony Roy Maling, and then introduced vocal bebop into Sydney clubs such as El Rocco, the Arabian, and the Mocambo. In 1949 he formed a vocal group with Ian Gunter, which worked at Sammy Lee's Club 47. He took on the stage name of Joe \\"Bebop\\" Lane. In the 1950s Lane led the Dee Jays, which singer Johnny O'Keefe later took over, and managed to secure jamming sessions with visiting Americans, including members of the Lionel Hampton and Stan Kenton bands. He also worked on the Cool for Cats TV show in Melbourne. 1968 saw Lane moving to New Zealand where he established his own jazz club/workshop in Auckland, presenting concerts and master-classes on the bebop vocal style. Returning to Sydney in 1971 he continued working venues and festivals. In the mid-1980s, he formed his own band Killer Joe, with drummer Dennis Sutherland, and later, The Jazz Cats, which had a residency at Sydney's Criterion Hotel. He also presented a 'history of jazz' show at The Basement in Sydney, which became legendary for the audience reactions it elicited. Lane was given a feature role in Kevin Lucas's award- winning jazz film Beyond El Rocco and in the mid-1990s he released his CD album, The Arrival. He was a headline artist in the Canberra Jazz Initiative in 1993, which was a month-long festival produced by students from the ANU School of Music Jazz Department. An established jazz artist was teamed up with the best student players for each of the twelve concerts. In 2002, Lane featured as soloist with the Australian Art Orchestra, directed by Paul Grabowsky (with ten other jazz vocalists) at the Sydney Opera House in a concert for the Sydney Festival entitled Testimony ‚Äì An Examination of the Life and Music of Charlie Parker. Joe Lane spent his final years in a nursing home in Sydney's inner-west, following a stroke that left him unable to speak, although he was remarkably still able to sing, which he did whenever his many musician friends visited. He died there on 13 April 2007, aged 80.

It was established in 2004 as the Kabul Bank, the first private bank in Afghanistan. After corruption and scandals it was re- established in 2011 as the New Kabul Bank. It is the main bank used to pay the salaries of the national army and security police forces. The bank provides facilities to maintain accounts in Current, Savings Bank, andfFixed deposits; and offers its consumers branch and automated teller machine services. The bank is under the supervision of the Central Bank of Afghanistan (Da Afghanistan Bank‚àíDAB), the General Directorate of Treasury, and the Afghanistan Ministry of Finance (MOF). History=Founding in 2004 An advertisement for the Bakht Account (Lucky Account) The Kabul Bank was established in 2004. Kabul Bank claims that accounts can be opened and maintained in afghani, U.S. dollars and euro. Kabul Bank claims that it is connected throughout the globe with SWIFT facility, which enables fund transfer for its customers. The bank has correspondent relationship with seven international banks situated in Germany, China, Iran, Tajikistan, Saudi Arabia and India. Corruption scandal Kabul Bank was badly shaken and almost collapsed in 2011, in one of \\"the worst banking scandals in history\\", according to The Guardian newspaper. In late 2012, according to the Los Angeles Times, independent investigators and journalists uncovered widespread corruption in Kabul Bank. The New York Times, in 2012, headlines indicate \\"Audit Says Kabul Bank Began as 'Ponzi Scheme'\\" following investigation and judicial action in the aftermath of the Bank's crisis and scandal. In 2010, it was disclosed that its Chairman Sherkhan Farnood and other insiders were spending the bank's US$1 billion for their own personal lavish style living and lending money under the table to family, relatives and friends. The bank scandal also involved members of Afghan President Karzai's family, including his brother Mahmood Karzai. In September 2010, one of the principal owners of the bank said that depositors had withdrawn $180 million in two days and predicted a \\"revolution\\" in the country's financial system unless the Afghan government and the United States moved quickly to help stabilize the bank. In November 2010, reports appeared that Farnood and chief executive Khalilullah Frozi both had been sacked from duties; as of early 2011 both were effectively under house arrest and could not leave the country, and in July 2011 both were formally arrested and detained in Kabul. DAB stated in February 2011, it would seek to sell Kabul Bank within three years once it was rehabilitated, but both the International Monetary Fund and US officials subsequently pressed for a rapid wind down of the institution. A USAID inspector general report estimated that fraudulent loans diverted $850 million to bank insiders. By October 2011, more than a year after the government seized control, officials had recovered less than 10 percent of the nearly $1 billion that went missing. Bank run and panic in 2010 After only six years in operation, in 2010 there was a panic of customers seeking to withdraw their savings from the bank. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. taxpayers' funded assistance in the form of Afghan government salaries deposited into Kabul Bank, Kabul Bank was on the brink of collapse and mobs of customers massed outside of bank locations trying to get their deposits out of the bank with limited luck. Despite Kabul Bank's near collapse in 2010 during the corruption allegations, Kabul Bank claims it is significant to Afghanistan's internal security and stability because it is the vehicle used to pay, largely with money supplied by the United States government, as many as 300,000 Afghan government employees, mostly military and police, who are key to plans to rebuild Afghanistan's capacity to deal with its ongoing Taliban-led insurgency. President Karzai's brother, Mahmood Karzai, is reported to have played a significant role in the bank scandal, and is alleged to have received millions of dollars in loans from Kabul Bank. He was later alleged to be under investigation by a U.S. Federal grand jury and U.S. tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for tax evasion allegations. Canada's Maclean's magazine reported that Mahmoud Karzai was being investigated for racketeering, extortion and tax evasion as a result of connections to the bank and Hamid Karzai.Wall Street Journal,(16 February 2011), \\"Grand Jury Investigates Karzai Brother U.S. Federal Probe Risks Worsening Relations With the Afghan President; Mahmood Karzai Hires a Washington Lawyer\\" During the bank scandal and panic in September 2010, hundreds of Afghans, including many civil servants and their families, gathered outside Kabul Bank offices in the capital and elsewhere in Afghanistan. Long lines formed of depositors hoping to withdrawal some or all of their money. Afghan police beat back mobs at the Kabul Bank worried their money would be lost according to the Washington Post. Panic set in among many depositors according to reports by the New York Times. On 27 December 2010, a suicide car bomber killed at least three Afghans, including one policeman, as he targeted police officers who lined up to withdraw their salaries in front of Kabul Bank in central Kandahar; the midday explosion also wounded 16 policemen and five civilians, officials said. 2011 aftermath of panic On 19 February 2011, at least 38 people (including 13 policemen) were killed during an insurgent raid on a branch of Kabul Bank in Jalalabad, the provincial capital of Nangarhar, and at least three militants were killed, officials said. Three suicide bombers reportedly entered the bank and detonated themselves, and fighting between insurgents and security forces continued for over four hours; President Hamid Karzai and a NATO International Security Assistance Force spokesman condemned the attack, which was the deadliest in the country since June 2010. In its July 2011 review of the Kabul Bank scandal and its aftermath, international non-governmental organization (NGO) Transparency International raised repeated concerns about problems of corruption in Afghanistan and its impact on the economy, business investment, security and civil society. 2010 depositor panic and aftermath In early 2010, the Washington Post reported that the Kabul Bank played a part in \\"a crony capitalism that enriches politically connected insiders and dismays the Afghan populace.\\" At the beginning of September, Frozi, one of the two largest shareholders of Kabul Bank, said reports indicating that the institution had lost as much as $300 million were overstated. But he predicted that if Afghan depositors continued to withdraw their money at the current rate, Kabul Bank would almost certainly collapse, undermining confidence in the nascent financial system the Afghans have been trying to build with American help. \\"If this goes on, we won‚Äôt survive\\", Mr. Frozi said in an interview. \\"If people lose trust in the banks, there will be a revolution in the financial system.\\" Afghan leaders promised to guarantee deposits in an attempt to arrest the panic, which began at the end of August 2010 when the country's top banking officials demanded the resignations of both Frozi and Farnood. \\"The government has decided that there will be an audit firm that will be coming to audit not only Kabul Bank accounts but also other private banks in Afghanistan\\", an Afghan presidential spokesman announced in late October. Earlier in the month, the government also froze assets held by some of Kabul Bank's owners even as the central bank governor said it was solvent and had the backing of Karzai's administration. U.S.-educated economist Hamidullah Farooqi, a former Karzai minister and chairman of the Afghanistan International Chamber of Commerce, said Afghanistan received a \\"massive wake-up call\\" from the crisis, further stating: \\"It's not just a lack of capacity in our institutions, there is a lack of laws and a lack of accountability, which is much more serious. It's a case of the blind leading the blind. They are too young, they are babies.\\" Mahmood Karzai is one of the brothers of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a seven-percent shareholder in the bank. In a telephone interview with the Boston Globe in September 2010, he said: \\"America should do something.\\" In October, the Washington Post reported that Mahmood Karzai could soon be indicted for tax evasion in the U.S., though he denied the charges, telling the newspaper: \\"I'm very clean\\", and insisting his only interest was \\"rebuilding Afghanistan.\\" In mid-January 2011, acting chief financial officer and other Pakistani employees of Kabul Bank fled to Pakistan, apparently out of fear for their lives and possible arrest, though some said they were being made scapegoats for powerful shareholders. Afghan authorities also called in several bank managers, including foreigners, for questioning and detained some in southern Afghanistan's Helmand Province in connection with illicit transfers of bank funds. In early February 2011, DAB Governor Abdul Qadir Fitrat said the central bank would impose stricter rules on banks wanting to handle about US$1.5 billion worth of salaries for government and security officials, which until now has been done by Kabul Bank. Fitrat also told Reuters the total amount of money at risk over suspected irregularities at Kabul Bank amounted to $579 million, almost twice the figure estimated when the bank's troubles first surfaced. Fitrat dismissed concerns that it faced liquidation, saying it would be privately owned again within three years. \\"Kabulbank is stabilised, it has enough cash at its disposal and the central bank is trying to rehabilitate the bank and then at some point sell it to potential buyers in two or three years,\\" Fitrat told Reuters. In early July 2011, Fitrat resigned as head of the central bank after fleeing to the United States, claiming his life had been threatened and that he was being made a scapegoat for politically connected individuals. After a mid-February 2011 visit by Neal Wolin, the U.S. deputy Treasury secretary, the Afghan finance ministry said that weak international support had exacerbated the crisis. \\"Afghan and US officials agreed that (the crisis)... was compounded by the erroneous audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and ineffective international technical assistance and supervision\\", the ministry said. However, Wolin pressed the government to rapidly place the lender into receivership, echoing calls made by a previous International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation. \\"The deputy secretary... stressed the need for the Afghan government to take swift and decisive action to ensure a credible, effective resolution of issues related to Kabul Bank,\\" the U.S. embassy said in statement. Kabul Bank was put into receivership following the scandal and a new bank set up, but only $70 million of fraudulent loans it granted have so far been recovered, with criminal investigations ongoing. In October 2011, Afghanistan's parliament approved a $51 million payment to DAB as part of a planned compensation package over its multi-million-dollar bailout; the payment is part of a package of government measures agreed with the IMF to secure a new loan. Afghanistan has been without an IMF program since the Kabul Bank failure, but the IMF announced that it is moving ahead on a new $129 million loan in the wake of the government's reform promises, with a new program expected to be submitted to the IMF executive board for approval in November 2011. At the end of June 2011, the Washington Post reported that Farnood and Frozi used fake names, forged documents, fictitious companies and secret records as part of an elaborate ruse to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to shareholders and top Afghan officials, including President Karzai's brother Mahmood and Mohammed Fahim, the country's first vice president. Both Farnood and Frozi were arrested in Kabul and held without charge, even though Afghanistan's attorney general said the evidence against them was \\"quite clear\\". Without a successful resolution of Kabul Bank's problems, one senior U.S. official said Afghanistan could face \\"the collapse of the banking sector.\\" As of October 2011, neither man had yet been charged with a crime, but Deputy Attorney General Enayatullah Nazari said the government intends to bring them to court. \\"A crime has happened\\", Nazari said. \\"They will go to the court whether they manage to secure the money or not\\". Authorities loosened the terms of their detention and provided them with a security detail to go to a bank office on workdays and on occasion to fancy restaurants and hotels for what Nazari described as work meetings. Depositor losses from collapse With regard to public sector corruption in Afghanistan and the loss of nearly U.S. $1 billion in U.S. taxpayers' funded foreign assistance to Afghanistan in the form of U.S.-supplied Afghan government and Afghan military and police salaries deposited into Kabul Bank, The New Yorker Magazine, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR) and others, have reported that widespread corruption, ponzi schemes, fraudulent loans, mass looting, insider loans to fake and bogus companies run by family and friends, and other corrupted practices, were undertaken by a small group of Afghan insiders (less than 12 people), apparently linked to Mahmoud Karzai, President Hamid Karzai and Ahmed Wali Karzai.International Wire, CNN (28 November 2012) \\"Widespread Corruption at Kabul Bank in Afghanistan\\" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2826806991.html This resulted in nearly $1 billion ($900 million) in Kabul Bank's deposits seemingly vanishing into Dubai and other off-shore locations and unknown offshore bank accounts and tax havens. Hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars were often smuggled and flown out of Afghanistan secretly stashed in bags and airline food traysDavidson, Amy, New Yorker Magazine, (1 September 2010) \\"Too Corrupt to Fail?\\" http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2010/09/too-corrupt-to- fail.htmlSutherland, J.J., National Public Radio (NPR), (27 September 2010) \\"Karzai Brother Being Investigated For Corruption\\" https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/09/27/130152430/karzai-brother- being-investigated-for-corruptionDavidson, Amy, The New Yorker (7 June 2012), \\"The Karzai Rule : Who Pays for Corruption in Afghanistan\\" 2012 anti- corruption report and reform efforts On 28 November 2012, the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee published its report and declared in a news conference that US$5 billion, including $400 million the Kabul Bank's shareholders, were illegally transferred abroad. About 22 people are accused of embezzlement in the case, and their trial started. At three hearings, 18 people, including Sher Khan Farnood and Khalil Ferozi, appeared before the court to defend themselves. Some $935 million of the bank assets was transferred abroad through various systems and $825 million are needed to bail out the bank. The Afghan government will have to pay 5‚Äì6% of its GDP to save the bank, which would be a huge blow to the country's economy. Since 2011, the Karzai Government has rejected banking oversight and reform efforts by the United States in the wake of the Kabul Bank scandal and collapse according to reports by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in 2013‚Äì14.U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) Audit Report, January 2014, \\"Afghanistan's Banking Sector: Central Banks Ability to Regulate Commercial Banks Remains Weak\\" http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/audits/SIGAR%2014-16-AR.pdf Banking experts, economists and humanitarian aid officials have expressed serious concern about this development given Kabul Bank's large and historic dependence on U.S. taxpayers' funding of bank deposits via payments of the Afghan National Army soldiers, police and Afghanistan's civil service employees who are largely paid with billions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Karzai government and to Afghanistan from the U.S. Congress, U.S. Treasury and ultimately U.S. taxpayer. The U.S. government has found anti-corruption efforts in Afghanistan in the wake of the Kabul Bank crisis as deeply troubling, including the banking sector, according to reports by the Washington Post in 2012 and SIGAR. 2014 murder of IMF official and executive sentences In January 2014, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) representative Wabel Abdallah, who assisted in the Kabul Bank crisis aftermath, was murdered by suicide bombers and gunmen in Kabul along with some 21 others in a high-profile attack that the Taliban said they undertook.Donati, Jessica, Reuters,18 January 2014, \\"IMF, U.N. officials among 21 killed in Kabul suicide attack\\" http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/01/18/afghanistan-explosion- idINDEEA0G0D020140118 Abdallah headed the IMF's office in Afghanistan since 2008. Following the departure of Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai in 2014, President Ashraf Ghani re-opened efforts to bring former Kabul Bank officials involved in the Kabul Bank Crisis to justice, extend and enforce prison sentences for those previously convicted, and seek to recover hundreds of millions of U.S. and Afghan taxpayers' dollars in funds stolen or lost by embezzlement, corruption, and fraud by the bank's insiders.Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany, (3 October 2014) \\"New probe into Kabul Bank scandal an 'important symbolic act'\\" http://dw.de/p/1DP2T Ghani vowed to seek to continue the investigation of the Kabul Bank crisis and fight corruption in Afghanistan. In October 2014, the Ghani Administration in Kabul reportedly officially re-opened the investigation.British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), (1 October 2014), \\"Kabul Bank fraud: Ghani reopens Afghan corruption case\\" https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29450821 New company After corruption and scandals it was re-established in 2011 as the New Kabul Bank. In 2011, 38 customers at the bank's branch in Jalalabad were killed by a Taliban bombing. Fighting with security forces lasted four hours, and four of the attackers were killed. Two men were later charged for the attack and executed in June 2011. A third person was sentenced to prison. In September 2010, the Afghan Central Bank said it was prepared to provide loans to the Kabul Bank, \\"if it requests\\". After the bailout by the government, by 2015, authorities were inviting bids to privatize the new bank. In 2016, Afghanistan's Joint-Stock Company offered to buy New Kabul Bank for $31 million. Pakistan's MCB Bank also made a bid, as New Kabul Bank was to be privatized in October 2018. In April 2015, the Islamic State or an associated group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at the entrance of a New Kabul Bank branch in Jalalabad, where government workers waited in line to collect salaries. 34 people were killed at least, and 125 injured. In June 2017, a Taliban suicide bomber killed 29 people at a Kabul Bank branch in the Helmand province. In August 2017, there were reports of long lines and slow services at the New Kabul Bank branch in the Paktika province, where it was the only bank in the region. That month, a suicide bomber targeted the Kabul Bank branch entrance close to the US embassy, resulting in five reported deaths. The Taliban claimed responsibility.

When he was seven years old he saw an airplane for the first time (?Very unlikely: Age 7 from Jan 1903 to Jan 1904; 1st plane Dec 1903 in North Carolina) and decided he wanted to become a pilot. He succeeded at a very young age and in 1912 set the United States altitude record. He was a demonstration, stunt and test pilot and performed in various movies. For one movie it was planned he had to crash an airplane. Gilpatric did so and survived the crash. However, the recordings were not good so he had to do it again. During World War I he was a fighter pilot for the US Army. He stayed in Europe and worked as a war reporter. After the war, Gilpatric lived in Antibes and worked as a publicity agent. It was there where he got the inspiration for his Mr. Glencannon stories, which were published in the Saturday Evening Post. In 1940, he and his wife Louise returned to the USA. In 1943, his book \\"Action in the North Atlantic\\" was made into a film.  Works  Gilpatric is best known for his short stories about Scottish ship engineer Colin Glencannon, published in the Saturday Evening Post and bundled in numerous books. A 39 episode TV series starring Thomas Mitchell as Colin Glencannon was produced in 1959. Other works include \\"Action in the North Atlantic\\", which was made into a movie starring Humphrey Bogart, and which was nominated for an Academy Award for best story in 1943. In Flying Stories Gilpatric describes the adventures of his early years as a pilot. His collection of short stories entitled Brownstone Front takes place in New York City during the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th. His novel French Summer is a humorous romance which revolves around vacationers at the French Riviera in the late 1920s. His character Francis X. Olvaney, illustrated as a crooked Tammany Hall politician responsible for dangerous slum areas, appears in stories contained in both Brownstone Front and Flying Stories, lending credence to the opinion that many of Gilpatric's short stories are autobiographical in nature. In 1938, Gilpatric published The Compleat Goggler (the archaic title a jocose reference to Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler), considered the first comprehensive guide to spearfishing. It outlines methods of constructing equipment, and techniques for spearing and cooking the fish. It was republished in 1957 as a free giveaway with an annual subscription to SkinDiver magazine. It is now out of print, and copies sell for up to $1000 US. In the late 1930s Gilpatric was living and spearfishing in the French Rivieram where he influenced diving pioneers like Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Hans Hass to begin spearfishing. Murder-suicide pact When his wife, Maude Louise Gilpatric, learned that she had breast cancer in July 1950, they decided to commit suicide together.Time Magazine, Monday, July 17, 1950 While waiting for the diagnosis to be confirmed, they explored the confusing array of treatment options with multiple experts. He shot her in the back of the head, then shot himself. They left notes for friends and family, saying they chose \\"mercy bullets\\" over \\"magic bullets\\". Their bodies were found in their Santa Barbara home by a house guest. Although it was never proven, it is widely believed that the doctor had read the wrong medical chart and that Maude did not have cancer.Kulczyk, David. (2009).

They may also be referred to as delivery positions or labor positions. In addition to the lithotomy position, still commonly used by many obstetricians, other positions are successfully used by midwives and traditional birth-attendants around the world. Engelmann's seminal work \\"Labor among primitive peoples\\" publicised the childbirth positions amongst primitive cultures to the Western world. They frequently use squatting, standing, kneeling and all fours positions, often in a sequence.Engelmann GJ Labor among primitive peoples (1883) They are referred to as upright birth positionsNon- Supine (e.g., Upright or Side-Lying) Positions for Birth. Lamaze International Education Council, Keen R, DiFranco J, Amis D, Albers L, Journal of Perinatal Education. 2004 spring; 13(2): 30‚Äì34. Upright birth positions in general Various people have promoted the adoption of upright birthing positions, particularly squatting, for Western countries, such as Grantly Dick-Read, Janet Balaskas, Moys√©s Paciornik and Hugo Sabatino. The adoption of the non- lithotomy positions is also promoted by the natural childbirth movement. Being upright during labour and birth can increase the available space within the pelvis by 28-30% giving more room to the baby for rotation and descent. There is also a 54% decreased incidence of foetal heart rate abnormalities when the mother is upright. These birthing positions can also reduce the duration of the second stage of labourPosition in the second stage of labour for women without epidural anaesthesia: RHL commentary. Lavender T and Mlay R. The WHO Reproductive Health Library; Geneva: World Health Organization. (last revised: 15 December 2006). as well as reduce the risk for emergency caesarian sections by 29%. They are also associated with the lower need for epidural. Different positions may be associated with different rates of perineal injury. Squatting position The Dumbarton Oaks birthing figureThe squatting position gives a greater increase of pressure in the pelvic cavity with minimal muscular effort. The birth canal will open 20 to 30% more in a squat than in any other position. It is recommended for the second stage of childbirth.Russell JG. Moulding of the pelvic outlet. J Obstet Gynaecol Br Commonw 1969;76:817-20. As most Western adults find it difficult to squat with heels down, compromises are often made such as putting a support under the elevated heels or another person supporting the squatter. In ancient Egypt, women delivered babies while squatting on a pair of bricks, known as birth bricks. All-fours Some mothers may choose the all-fours position instinctively. It can help the baby turn around in the case of a malpresentation of the head. Since this position uses gravity, it decreases back pain, as the mother is able to tilt her hips. Side lying Side lying may help slow the baby's descent down the birth canal, thereby giving the perineum more time to naturally stretch. To assume this position, the mother lies on her side with her knees bent. To push, a slight rolling movement is used such that the mother is propped up on one elbow is needed, while one leg is held up. This position does not use gravity but still holds an advantage over the lithotomy position, as it does not position the vena cava under the uterus, which decreases blood flow to mother and child.  Lithotomy position  In the lithotomy position, the mother is lying on her back with her legs up in stirrups and her buttocks close to the edge of the table. This position is convenient for the caregiver because it permits him or her more access to the perineum. However, this is not a comfortable position for most patients, considering the pressure on the vaginal walls because the baby's head is uneven and the labor process is working against gravity.

It starts off just east of Garth Street on the West mountain and is a two-way street throughout that extends eastward and ends at Mountain Brow Boulevard, a road that wraps around the edge of the Niagara Escarpment on Hamilton mountain. History Fennell Avenue, is most likely named after Joseph Fennell, (1835‚Äì1919), Anglican priest. Early maps and directories listed the street as Fenel, Fennel and then finally, Fennell. Auchmar, the estate of the Honourable Isaac Buchanan was built between 1852 and 1854 on a private estate on on the Hamilton mountain that he called Clairmont Park. Located at what is now the corner of Fennell and West 5th, the manor house, and its intact outbuildings, and stone wall-surrounded orchard sit on of land that include the original landscaped grounds. Auchmar is a unique, heritage asset owned by the citizens of Hamilton. Auchmar is recognized by the Ontario Heritage Trust as having significant historical value. Isaac Buchanan, was an international merchant, first president of the Hamilton Club, founder of Hamilton and Toronto boards of trade - forerunners to modern chambers of commerce - and founder of the regiment that would later become the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry. In 1945, there was talk of constructing a tunnel on James Street South, in the Lower city to a surface point just south of Fennell Avenue. The cost was an issue but some city officials at the time felt it was necessary for the city to grow south, instead of their present unbalanced east-west development. The population of Hamilton Mountain at the time was 20,000 but some felt the numbers were actually larger because many tenants were not listed on voters' lists. On June 1, 1949 the city of Hamilton issued 61 building permits on East Twenty-Seventh and East Twenty-Eighth Streets between Queensdale and Fennell Avenues. At the time it was the largest number of building permits issued at one time in the city by the City's building department and was described as \\"the biggest unsubsidized housing scheme in Canada.

It was founded in 1966 and has led to numerous direct and indirect jobs in education and research. Mohawk first started granting diplomas in 1966, and has since grown into one of the largest provincially funded colleges in the province of Ontario. Each year averages approximately 10,000 full-time students, and 40,000 part-time students. The most popular programs continue to be in Engineering Technology and Business. Mohawk College also has a well known nursing program, a joint program with McMaster University. Hillfield Strathallan College is also located on Fennell Ave West (west of Mohawk College) the only private K-12 school in the area. Founded in 1901 as Highfield School for Boys, this school was the first private residential and day school for boys in the city of Hamilton. It was a prep school for boys planning to enter the Royal Military College of Canada. Many graduates played key roles in the Canadian military. A series of name changes, reconstructions, new construction, and amalgamations with other institutions have since occurred, resulting in a single modern co-educational facility. Alumni from all founding organizations attended the centennial anniversary in 2001. Famous alumni include Henry Duncan Graham Crerar, Canada's leading Field Commander during the Second World War, Steve Paikin, host of TVOntario‚Äôs Studio Two, Kathleen Robertson, actress, played the role of Clare Arnold on Beverly Hills, 90210 and Gema Zamprogna, actress, played the role of Felicity Clark on Road to Avonlea. Uli's Stairs are stone steps that connect the mountain brow to the Rail Trail. They were made by a local man named Ulrich, otherwise known as Uli. The city sees his steps as a risk to public safety. These steps are also the only steps connecting the Lower City of Hamilton to the Upper City in East Hamilton. The city has a set of steps made of steel nearby at the end of Kimberly Drive near Kenilworth Avenue but they only go halfway up to the Escarpment Rail Trail and the Bruce Trail. Uli's steps makes up the final link between the Rail Trail and the mountain brow on top. The city of Hamilton plans on building a set of metal stairs near Margate Avenue which will cost the city $425,000 to install, just a few metres from Uli's steps but it has been met with opposition from residents at the top of the planned stairs. The Mountain Plaza Mall at Fennell Avenue and Upper James Street has been rebuilt in a $50-million project, with Walmart Canada as an anchor tenant.

The highest values registered at the mouth have approached , but the typical value when the river is in flood is around . The minimal discharge reported is . The river rises in the Le Lari massif of the province of Pistoia (Tuscany) at about above sea level, from two streams that join near Le Piastre, in the comune of Pistoia. Its upper course marks the border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna and flows in a wooded area crossed by the Bologna-Porretta-Pistoia railway line (inaugurated in 1864 and one of the most outstanding for the time as for engineering effort). The upper course is characterized by several artificial reservoirs whose dams are used for hydro-electric energy production. The power produced in the basin of the Reno basin is second, for Apennine rivers, only to that of the Nera-Velino in Umbria. It passes west of Bologna, at Casalecchio di Reno. In its lower course the Reno receives the water of numerous streams, some of which are seasonal. The most important include the Limentra orientale, Silla, Setta, Samoggia, Idice, Sillaro, Santerno and Senio. The Reno was a tributary of the Po until the middle of the 18th century when the course was diverted to lessen the risk of devastating floods. It now joins the Adriatic Sea near Casalborsetti, south-east of the Valli di Comacchio. The name of the river has the same etymology as the name of the Rhine, as both derive from the same Celtic hydronym *Rƒìnos, the Reno basin being situated within Gallia Cisalpina, in what was the territory of Boii before the Roman conquest of 220 BC. In Italian both rivers are called Reno, and in Latin both were called Rhenus. In 43 BC the pact establishing the Second triumvirate was signed on an islet of the river near Bononia (Bologna).

On some recordings, the orchestra goes under the name \\"G√ºrzenich-Orchester K√∂lner Philharmoniker\\". Its name comes from its past principal concert venue, the G√ºrzenich concert hall in Cologne. Currently, its primary concert venue is the K√∂lner Philharmonie (Cologne Philharmonic Hall). The G√ºrzenich Orchestra traces its origins to 1827, when a group of Cologne B√ºrger sponsored the creation of the \\"C√∂lner Concert-Gesellschaft\\" (Cologne Concert Society) to set up \\"Gesellschaftskonzerte\\" (Society concerts) and \\"Abonnementskonzerte\\" (subscription concerts). The orchestra began to give concerts at the G√ºrzenich concert hall in 1857, from which it derived its current name. In 1986, the orchestra took up residence at the K√∂lner Philharmonie. The orchestra also plays in opera productions in the Cologne Opera. From 2003 until 2014, the G√ºrzenich-Kapellmeister, or chief conductor of the G√ºrzenich Orchestra, was Markus Stenz. He concluded his G√ºrzenich tenure in 2014. In February 2014, the city of Cologne announced the appointment of Fran√ßois-Xavier Roth as the next Generalmusikdirektor (GMD) of the city of Cologne, which includes the post of G√ºrzenich-Kapellmeister. The appointment of Roth as the 13th G√ºrzenich- Kapellmeister is effective on 1 September 2015, with an initial contract of 5 years. In October 2018, the orchestra extended Roth's contract to 2022. Premieres The world premieres performed by the G√ºrzenich Orchestra include the following works: * Johannes Brahms, Double Concerto for Violin and Cello (1887) * Gustav Mahler, Symphony No. 3 (in collaboration with the St√§dtischen Kapelle Krefeld, 1902) * Gustav Mahler, Symphony No. 5 (1904) * Max Reger, Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Hiller (1907) * Richard Strauss, Don Quixote (1898) * Richard Strauss, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks (1895) * Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Sinfonia prosodica (1964)  G√ºrzenich-Kapellmeister  * Conradin Kreutzer (1840‚Äì1842) * Heinrich Dorn (1843‚Äì1849) * Ferdinand Hiller (1850‚Äì1884) * Franz W√ºllner (1884‚Äì1902) * Fritz Steinbach (1903‚Äì1914) * Hermann Abendroth, GMD (1915‚Äì1934) * Eugen Papst (1936‚Äì1944) * G√ºnter Wand, GMD (1945‚Äì1974) * Yuri Ahronovitch (1975‚Äì1986) * Marek Janowski (1986‚Äì1990) * James Conlon, GMD (1990‚Äì2002) * Markus Stenz, GMD (2003‚Äì2014) * Fran√ßois- Xavier Roth, GMD (2015‚Äìpresent) Recordings The orchestra's discography https://www.discogs.com/artist/866649-G%C3%BCrzenich-Orchester-K%C3%B6lner- Philharmonikerincludes several CDs for EMI Classics of the music of Alexander von Zemlinsky, conducted by James Conlon. Under their Conductor Emeritus Dmitri Kitayenko the orchestra recorded a number of complete cycles by the composers Shostakovitch, Prokofiev, and Tchaikowski. In October 2005, the G√ºrzenich Orchestra began to produce their own commercial CD recordings under the \\"GO live!\\" label. One unique feature of these recordings is that these are recordings of the orchestra's performances that same evening, made available within 5 minutes of the end of the concert for purchase by audience members. The \\"Live CDs\\" were stopped after Stenz's tenure, in favour of live streaming from the orchestra's website.

With his wife Gertrud Natzler, he produced what were considered some of the most admired ceramic pieces of the 20th century.Seattle Times Obit  Personal life  The son of Dr. Sigmund Natzler, a dentist, and a stay-at- home mother Regina Frieda Lowy, Natzler was born in Vienna, Austria and first exposed to art by his uncle. He began his working life at the age of 15 by taking a textile design course and subsequently finding employment devising colour schemes at a local necktie factory, a company that was blacklisted in Nazi Germany and shut down in 1933. Natzler's first wife was Bertha Steinmetz whom he married on November 9, 1930 in Vienna, Austria. Naztler met his second wife and partner, secretary Gertrud Amon, in 1933, although their romance did not blossom until after he divorced his first wife in 1934. Though they were self-taught, by 1937 they had already begun to submit pieces, winning a silver medal at the Paris Exposition in 1937.Garth Clark Gallery  Work  'Footed Vase', glazed ceramic by Otto Natzler, 1981, Smithsonian American Art Museum 1938 marked the beginning of the Naztlers' serious commitment to their craft. After winning the silver medal on March 11 of that year, the couple married in June and fled Vienna for Los Angeles in September, with the help of Otto's cousin. From 1938 to 1971, the year of Gertrud's death, the duo produced an increasingly notable body of work, with Gertrud as the potter and Otto as the glazer. Gertrud's forms were reminiscent of the Vienna Secessionist movement, while Otto perfected over 2,000 colours and styles of glazes. In 1999, Modernism Magazine declared that the Natzlers' work was \\"among the finest pottery of all time.\\"  Later life  Gertrud died in 1971 and Otto married photographer Gail Reynolds in 1973. Otto initially refused to glaze the last set of pots that Gertrud had thrown, but Reynolds soon convinced him to return to his work. After being described as \\"vital and active\\" from a rigorous exercise program well into his 90s, Natzler succumbed to cancer in Los Angeles at the age of 99.Heydarpour, Roja (April 23, 2007).

Operation in the microgravity environment of the ISS will provide a stable and accurate time base for different areas of research, including general relativity and string theory tests, time and frequency metrology, and very long baseline interferometry. The payload actually contains two clocks: a caesium laser cooled atomic clock (PHARAO) developed by CNES, France for long- term stability and an active hydrogen maser (SHM) developed by Spectratime, Switzerland for short-term stability. The onboard frequency comparison between PHARAO and SHM will be a key element for the evaluation of the accuracy and the short/medium-term stability of the PHARAO clock. Further, it will allow to identify the optimal operating conditions for PHARAO and to select a compromise between frequency accuracy and stability. The mission will also be a test-bed for the space qualification of the active hydrogen maser SHM. After optimisation performances in the range for both frequency instability and inaccuracy are intended. This corresponds to a time error of about 1 second over 300 million () years.

History The Nauo were the indigenous people of the area of Minnipa prior to English colonisation and the area around the town was first settled by Europeans in 1878. At the arrival of the railway line on 5 May 1913, the town consisted of two tents.Minnipa and Eyre Peninsula Development of the surrounding districts followed the railway, and accelerated after the opening of the water pipeline from the Tod River scheme in 1925. By 1960, Minnipa was the major railway centre between Cummins and Thevenard. Before the construction of the Tod River scheme and its network of pipelines, tanks were constructed at many locations to catch the runoff from the granite outcrops which are a feature of the landscape. The earliest of these were constructed at Minnipa Hill in 1914 by the South Australian Railways. These historic tanks were reconditioned in the 1990s and fitted with new roofs to provide a standby water supply for Minnipa.Minnipa and District The town was proclaimed in 1915 and subsequently it became a typical wheatbelt town servicing the surrounding area and providing the necessary grain handling and rail facilities to allow farmers fast access to Thevenard and Port Lincoln. Within the town are a number of grain silos that serve to store the local wheat crop. Adjacent to the silos is a disused railway siding which used to freight the grain crop to Port Lincoln, which is now done by road transport for export around the world. The town's rural life includes several churches, a general store, caravan park, pub, fodder store, vet clinic and other industry based companies. Its sporting tradition includes swimming, Australian Rules football, tennis, netball and table tennis. Gawler Ranges on the right The town is close both to the west coast of Eyre Peninsula, and to the Gawler Ranges. It is located in the centre of a vast low-rainfall wheat belt and the surrounding countryside includes numerous wind-shaped granite outcrops. The 'wave' shapes and varied colours of the granite outcrops or bornhardts in the area were formed by moisture-induced decomposition of the sub-surface granite when the ground level was much higher. Gradual erosion of the surface soil has left the granite outcrops exposed. Popular tourist destinations These granite outcrops were noted by Edward John Eyre, and a few years later the Government sponsored an expedition to map and record the native names of the outcrops, they were Tcharkulda, Yarwondutta, Minnipa, Chilpuddie and Pildappa. Fifteen km north of Minippa township is the standout Pildappa Rock whose incredible flowing forms rival the singular form of the better known Wave Rock in Western Australia.Minnipa, South Australia Climate Minnipa has a semi-arid climate with hot and dry summers and only moderately wet winters.

In each independent state, empire, or dependency, the relationship between class and nation had its own particularities. The Ukrainian communists Vasil Shakhrai and Mazlakh and then Muslim Sultan Galiyev considered the interests of the Bolshevik Russian state at odds with those of their countries. This was followed after 1945 by the Yugoslav communist lifelong president Josip Broz Tito when he attempted to pursue an independent foreign policy. Communism as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels envisioned it was meant to be very internationalist as proletarian internationalism was expected to place class conflict well ahead of nationalism as a priority for the working class. Nationalism was seen as a tool that the bourgeoisie used to divide and rule the proletariat (bourgeois nationalism). Whereas the influence of international communism was very strong from the late 19th century through the 1920s, the decades after that‚Äîbeginning with socialism in one country and progressing into the Cold War and the Non-Aligned Movement‚Äîmade national communism a larger political reality.  The Communist Manifesto (1848)  During the decade of the 1840s, the word \\"communist\\" came into general use to describe those who hailed the left-wing of the Jacobin Club of the French Revolution as their ideological forefathers.David Fernbach, \\"Introduction\\" to Karl Marx, The Revolutions of 1848. New York: Random House, 1973; pg. 23. In 1847, the Communist League was founded in London. The League asked Karl Marx and Frederick Engels to draft The Communist Manifesto, which was adopted by the league and published in 1848. The Communist Manifesto included a number of views of the role of the nation in the implementation of the manifesto. The preamble notes that The Communist Manifesto arose from Europeans from various nations coming together in London to publish their shared views, aims and tendencies. Chapter one then discusses how the rise of the bourgeoisie has led to globalisation and the place of national issues: :In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. :Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi- barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West. [...] Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie. Maxime Rodinson wrote in Marxism and the Muslim World the following: :Classical Marxism, for once faithful to Marx himself, postulates that a socialist state cannot be imperialist. But no proof is provided to support this thesis. According to Roman Rozdolsky: \\"When the Manifesto says that the workers 'have no country', this refers to the bourgeois national state, not to nationality in the ethnical sense. The workers 'have no country' because according to Marx and Engels, they must regard the bourgeois national state as a machinery for their oppression[19]-and after they have achieved power they will likewise have 'no country' in the political sense, inasmuch as the separate socialist national states will be only a transitional stage on the way to the classless and stateless society of the future, since the construction of such a society is possibly only on the international scale\\".  Later use  Milovan Djilas popularized the term in his New Class (1957): ‚ÄúNo single form of communism [...] exists in any other way than as national communism. In order to maintain itself it must become national\\". A few years earlier, ex communist Manabendra Roy noted: ‚ÄúCommunism in Asia is essentially nationalism painted Red\\". The Dutch Social Democrat Anton Pannakoek and Russian monarchists Nicholas Ustrialov and Vasilii Shulgin pointed out in 1920 that Russians first \\"nationalized\\" communism. They thus drew attention to how far the Bolsheviks differed from all other European social democratic parties in terms of structure and ideology and to the fact Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik Party (formed from the left-wing of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party) can be considered the first national communist party. In March 1918, Lenin renamed his party the Russian Communist Party. National communism also refers to non- Russian communist currents that arose in the former tsarist empire after Lenin seized power in October 1917 and to the various communist regimes that emerged after 1945 in other parts of the world. In the wake of their Russian counterparts, left-wing socialists in Ukraine and the Muslim areas of the former tsarist empire also developed distinct variants of communism that continued in the Soviet Union until 1928. Ukrainian and Muslim variants differed from each other on two points in particular. The Muslims believed the fate of world revolution depended on events in Asia and not Europe. They also argued alliances with the national bourgeoisie were necessary for the duration of the liberation struggle. Class divisions had to be ignored, otherwise the national bourgeoisie would turn away from national liberation, ally with their imperial counterparts and thus ensure the ultimate collapse of any revolutionary struggle and national liberation. In its Muslim variant, it was a synthesis of nationalism, communism and anarchism as well as religion. Muslim communists included people from groups which predated the Russian Revolution, joining the Russian Bolshevik Party between 1917 and 1920‚Äîsome of whom later were Narkomnats under the People's Commissar Joseph Stalin.  In Ukraine  In 1918, the book Do Khvyli (translated into English as On The Current Situation in the Ukraine, P. Potichnyj ed. [1970]), written by the Ukrainian communists Serhii Mazlakh and Vasyl' Shakhrai, challenged what they saw as Russian domination over Ukraine under Bolshevik rule. The precursors of the Ukrainian communists, the Ukrainian left-social democrats in March 1919 tried to direct the mass anti-Bolshevik uprising that began then in Ukraine, but failed to win control over a sizable territory. Their main military force under Danylo Zeleny was defeated by July 1919. Faced with Anton Denikin's successful offensive, they decided to stop further military activity and ally with the Bolsheviks as the lesser evil. In January 1920, they formed the Ukrainian Communist Party which recognized Russian communist rule over Soviet Ukraine, but criticized Bolshevik administrative, cultural, political, party and economic centralization. In a letter submitted to the Third International that year, they extended the analysis of Shakhrai and Mazlakh.\\"Letter from the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party to the Executive of the Comintern,\\" Debatte no. 2 (2009) http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09651560903172282  In Muslim regions of the former Russian Empire  Open conflict between prominent Muslim theorists such as Mirs√§yet Soltanƒü√§liev and Lenin and Stalin broke out in 1919 at the Second Congress of the Communist International over the autonomy of the Muslim Communist Party as well as at the Congress of the Peoples of the East and the First Conference of the Turkic Peoples' Communists of Soviet Russia and significantly at the Tenth Congress of the Bolshevik Party (April 1921). The crisis resulted in the purge of the Communist Party of Turkestan in December 1922 and the arrest of Sultan Galiev in 1923. Galiev was the first Bolshevik Party member to be arrested by Stalin. The immediate cause of his arrest were his comments on the 12th Congress resolutions regarding concessions to non-Russians. Stalin was infuriated that Galiev rejected his juxtaposition of \\"great power chauvinism\\" with \\"local nationalism\\". Reaction to great-power chauvinism, Galiev explained, was not \\"nationalism\\" and it was simply reaction to great power chauvinism. Nine days later, he was arrested. During this time, Soltanƒü√§liev, Turar Ryskulov, Nariman Narimanov and Ahmet Baytursunov were very influential especially through the Communist University of the Toilers of the East which opened in 1921 and was very active until its staff was purged in 1924. Communists from outside the Soviet Union such as Manabendra Nath Roy, Henk Sneevliet and Sultan Zade also taught there, formulating similar political positions. Students of the university included Sen Katayama, Tan Malaka, Liu Shaoqi and Ho Chi Minh. The great purge in the Muslim republics began in 1928 with executions of Veli Ibrahimov of the Tatar Communist Party and Milli Firka followed by the leaders of Hummet, Tatar Communist Party and even the Tatar Union of the Godless. It also happened in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and the Young Bukharians.

The organization is based in the iconic Tarr & Wonson Paint Manufactory in Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States. It was founded in 1971 by biologist Roger Payne. Led by Payne and Chief Executive Officer Iain Kerr, Ocean Alliance collects a broad spectrum of data on whales and ocean life relating particularly to toxicology, behavior, bioacoustics, and genetics. From those data, the alliance works with its scientific partners to advise educators and policy makers on wise stewardship of the oceans in order to: reduce pollution, prevent the collapse of marine mammal populations, maintain human access to fish and other sea life, and benefit ocean and human health. History Ocean Alliance was founded in 1971 by whale biologist Dr. Roger Payne, with the purpose of saving the great whales from the very real extinction risk which commercial whaling posed at the time. Payne, along with colleague Scott McVay, became famous for the discovery that humpback whales sing songs, a discovery which allowed him to become an influential figure in the worldwide campaign to end commercial whaling. Since its founding under Payne, and later under the stewardship of current CEO Dr. Iain Kerr, Ocean Alliance has been an important group in the worldwide effort to research and protect great whales. They are well-respected for developing benign research techniques, and in the process proving that far more can be learnt from a live whale than from a dead one. Many of their exploits have brought them closely into the public eye, leading Payne to describe the group as \\"the group you don‚Äôt know you know\\". During the 1990s, Payne established that the way to save whales would be to show them to the world, and Ocean Alliance became involved in over forty documentaries including In the Company of Whales and the IMAX film Whales. In 1979, Roger Payne said that pollution would replace the harpoon as the greatest threat to whales, and in more recent years much of Ocean Alliance's work has been directed towards combating this growing threat. From 2000‚Äì2005, under the leadership of Iain Kerr, Ocean Alliance launched the Voyage of the Odyssey, which provided the first ever global data set on pollution in the oceans. This project lasted five years and spanned the entire planet. In the executive summary of the program, Roger Payne states that, \\"The Voyage of the Odyssey has proven irrefutably that ocean life is becoming polluted to unacceptable levels by metals and human-made contaminants.\\" Accomplishments ‚Ä¢ 1967: Ocean Alliance founder and president Dr. Roger Payne discovered, along with Scott McVay, that humpback whales sing songs. This was an important hallmark of the Save the Whales movement.Anti-whaling#Save the Whales ‚Ä¢ 1970s: Payne and Ocean Alliance demonstrated mathematically that the songs of Blue whales and Fin whales are audible across entire ocean basins. The recent corroboration of this theory may explain, for the first time, why these species have no known breeding grounds. ‚Ä¢ 1970s: Payne and Ocean Alliance are instrumental in establishing an 860 square mile whale park (Golfo San Jose), off Peninsula Valdes in southern Argentina-an important breeding ground for endangered Southern right whales. This led to a permanent research program being set up, which is now the longest continuously running study on baleen whales (the program entered its 44th year in 2013). Since 1996 the program has been run in conjunction with the Instituto de Conservaci√≥n de Ballenas.:es:Instituto de Conservaci√≥n de Ballenas ‚Ä¢ 1970s: Ocean Alliance scientists pioneer many of the benign research techniques now commonly used worldwide to study free-ranging whales. ‚Ä¢ 1979, National Geographic magazine published an article by Roger Payne which includes a sound sheet of his ‚ÄòSongs of the Humpback Whale‚Äô. ‚Ä¢ 1984‚Äì1989: Payne is selected for a 'Genius Grant' through the MacArthur Fellows Program. ‚Ä¢ 1990's‚ÄìPresent: An education drive is implemented by CEO Iain Kerr to support Ocean Alliance's programs. This included partnerships with schools in Massachusetts developing an elementary whale study curriculum ‚ÄòLooking at Whales‚Äô, the Cetacean Education Through Awareness (CETA) program in Gloucester, Massachusetts; the ‚ÄòEducation Today‚Äô program developed in partnership with the Discovery Channel, the Pacific Life WHALE Education program with various schools across the United States and the Ocean Encounters multimedia education program. ‚Ä¢ 1990's‚ÄìPresent: Ocean Alliance are involved in the production of over 40 documentaries studying whales, including 'In the Company of Whales' and the IMAX film Whales. Their research vessel Odyssey has been featured on PBS, National Geographic, Discovery Channel, BBC, Canal Plus, NHK, Network Ten Australia, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Television New Zealand and many others. ‚Ä¢ 1970's‚Äì2000's: Ocean Alliance is involved in setting up and protecting marine parks in Hawaii, Alaska, Sri Lanka, the Galapagos Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico. In 2003, Ocean Alliance's work leads directly to a 1.2 million square mile marine mammal sanctuary being created in the waters of Papua New Guinea. ‚Ä¢ 1994: Massachusetts governor William D. Weld signed a proclamation establishing April 21 as Roger Payne and Ocean Alliance day in celebration of Earth Day. ‚Ä¢ 2000‚Äì2005: Under CEO Iain Kerr, Ocean Alliance launched 'the Voyage of the Odyssey', to gather the first ever data set on pollutants throughout the world's oceans. This was a massive undertaking, receiving media attention worldwide. ‚Ä¢2008: Bought the Tarr & Wonson Paint Manufactory in Gloucester, Massachusetts to be the new headquarters. ‚Ä¢2010‚Äì2014: Ocean Alliance spends five summers in the Gulf of Mexico in an attempt to determine the long-term toxicological impacts of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. ‚Ä¢2015: Ocean Alliance 'Drones for Whale Research initiative begins after a successful KickStarter campaign. The program, with the flagship 'SnotBot' program at its core, is now Ocean Alliance's primary research activity. Headquarters: The Gloucester Paint Factory In 2008, Ocean Alliance purchased the Tarr & Wonson Paint Manufactory in Gloucester, Massachusetts to be its new headquarters. The Tarr & Wonson Paint Manufactory is one of the most well-known landmarks on the North Shore (Massachusetts), significant for being the place where Anti-fouling paint, used to prevent the build-up of marine growth on the bottom of boats, was perfected. Since its building it has been a landmark of Gloucester harbour, and Gloucester fishermen have long counted themselves as being home when they glimpsed the red walls of this iconic structure sitting at the gateway of Gloucester harbour. As technology developed, the type of paint made at the Gloucester Paint Factory became obsolete, and in the 1980s the Factory was shut down. Over the decades a lack of maintenance, the toxic nature of the chemical compounds used to make the copper-based paint and the elements have all pulled the buildings into disrepair. In 2008 Ocean Alliance purchased the buildings to be their new headquarters with the intention of making the Paint Factory a proud symbol of the city of Gloucester's pioneering spirit and of its intimate connection with the seas. Ocean Alliance is currently developing the buildings, and among other things hope the buildings will house a state-of- the-art education center (complete with a library, a classroom and an interactive learning/media environment), a Paint Factory Museum and anti- fouling paint exhibit, offices, conference spaces, a robotics laboratory developing the research tools of tomorrow and a toxicology laboratory. Major Research Programs=The Voyage of the Odyssey The Voyage of the Odyssey was a 5-year program which collected the first baseline data set on contaminants in the world's oceans. It was launched from San Diego in March 2000, and ended five and a half years later in Boston, August 2005. In a 1979 National Geographic magazine article Ocean Alliance founder and president Dr. Roger Payne predicted that toxic pollution would replace the harpoon as the next greatest threat to whales. Recognizing the stark lack of data on the subject, Roger set his organisation Ocean Alliance the task of obtaining a global baseline data set on contaminants. After years of planning and fund- raising, the program was finally ready to launch in 2000. In the executive summary of the project, Roger stated that, ‚ÄòThe Voyage of the Odyssey has proven irrefutably that ocean life is becoming polluted to unacceptable levels by metals and human-made contaminants.‚Äô The focus of the program was on Sperm whales, a cosmopolitan species found in every major ocean. As long-lived apex predators, Sperm whales represent a useful bioindicator of health in the marine ecosystem in a toxicological context, owing to the effects of three key processes: bioaccumulation, biomagnification and the generation effect. Sadly, these three processes also make Sperm whales, and other apex predators, at great risk from toxic pollution. As mammalian apex predators that nurse their young with milk, they are also relatively similar to us, and thus are seen as the ‚Äòcanaries in the golf mine‚Äô regards humanities relationship with the oceans. The program also had a robust educational and outreach component. In every country they visited, Odyssey crew members met with government leaders, students, teachers and journalists-many of whom kept promoting ocean health after the Odyssey departed for its next research location. The program was also the focus of a major online diary & educational webpage through American broadcaster PBS. Aside from collecting the first baseline data set on contaminants in the world's oceans, the program was witness to a number of other successes, innovations and firsts. These include: ‚Ä¢ uncovering illegal shark finning operations ‚Ä¢ documenting the use of massive drift nets in the Mediterranean ‚Ä¢ helping to create a 1.2 million square-mile marine mammal sanctuary in Papua New Guinea waters ‚Ä¢ made incredibly rare sightings of a live Longman's beaked whale ‚Ä¢ recorded sightings of blue whales in equatorial waters where they were thought never to be present ‚Ä¢ the first successful satellite tag on a sperm whale (by visiting scientist Bruce Mate) ‚Ä¢ the first electrocardiogram of a sperm whale (by visiting scientist Dr. Jorge Reynolds) ‚Ä¢ the training of over 100 scientists from Latin America in the benign research techniques developed by the Ocean Alliance; ‚Ä¢ the first successful underwater sonar tracking of sperm whales throughout their dives, ‚Ä¢ technique for placing remote sensing packages on the backs of whales and for acquiring skin samples more easily. On the program, Roger Payne commented that, ‚ÄòSaving marine animals from the insidious effects of pesticides, fire retardants, plasticizers, and poisonous metals is not a selfless act. By saving the ocean for whales, we may just be able to save countless other oceanic species and leave our children and grandchildren a healthy ocean rather than one contaminated with the by-products of our progress.‚Äô More information on the Voyage of the Odyssey can be found on Ocean Alliance's website. Patagonia Right whale program The Patagonia Right Whale program is one of the longest continually running studies on great whales: as of 2014 the program entered its 44th year. Ocean Alliance founder Dr. Roger Payne set up the program in 1970, on realizing that he could identify individual whales based on the patterns of cyamids (whale lice) on their heads. This opened up an enormous opportunity to gain far more information on the life-history of individual whales than had previously been possible. Roger also recognized its significance as it enabled him to learn far more from a live whale than the whaling community was learning from dead whales. The program is now ran by Dr. Victoria Rowntree, in conjunction with Dr. Mariano Sironi of the Instituto Conservaci√≥n de Ballenas. The unique long-term nature of this program has produced a number of significant discoveries relating to the ecology, biological life cycle, ethology and conservation of these species. As time has gone on, the program has been expanded to include genetics, feeding ecology and bioacoustics. The techniques that initially Roger Payne, and later on Victoria Rowntree and Instituto Conservacion de Ballenas, pioneered are now well-established among cetacean science programs worldwide. So called because they were the ‚Äòright‚Äô whale to kill, Southern right whales were brought to the verge of extinction during the early 20th century. Their enormous blubber reserves caused the animals to float after being killed, whilst their slow- moving nature made them easy targets. Whilst significant conservation threats still remain (primarily habitat loss), many populations have shown slow signs of recovery. The long-term objective of the Patagonian Right Whale Program is to promote and facilitate this recovery. Gulf of Mexico program In April 2010, approximately 210 million gallons of oil was released into the Gulf of Mexico marine environment following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In response, over 2 million gallons of oil dispersant was released, in unprecedented quantities and untested ways, in an effort to break up and sink the oil. In July 2010, Ocean Alliance, in partnership with the Wise Laboratory of Environmental and Genetic Toxicology, took the RV Odyssey into the area in an effort to determine the, often over-looked, long-term impacts of this environmental catastrophe. After such incidents, people often look no further than the immediate impact: death tolls of particular species are logged, population declines/increases recorded, and these figures are seen as broadly representative of the environmental damage. The toxicological work being conducted by Ocean Alliance and their partners at the Wise Lab was primarily aimed at determining the chronic, long-term impact of the incident-in particular the geno-toxic impacts of oil (and compounds found in oil) and dispersants as they work their way up the trophic food chain. The long-term effects are believed by many to be far more significant than the short-term effects, a belief corroborated by on-going research in the Gulf of Mexico and the fact that the impacts of the Exxon Valdez spill (which occurred in 1985 in Prince William Sound, Alaska) are still being studied over 25 years after the initial accident. In terms of total discharge of oil, this spill was approximately one tenth of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Perhaps the most significant economic impact of the Exxon Valdez disaster-the collapse of the Herring fishery, only collapsed four years after the spill, and to this day is not showing signs of recovery. This makes the kind of long-term focused program Ocean Alliance conducted all the more important. Preliminary analysis has shown potentially damaging levels of genotoxic metals including chromium and nickel in Sperm whales living in the area, significantly higher than the global average. Furthermore, it has shown a correlation between proximity to the spill and levels of these genotoxic metals. To achieve this aim of conducting a long-term analysis, Ocean Alliance monitored the top apex predator of the region, the Sperm whales. A resident, non-migratory population of Sperm whales resides in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in close proximity to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. As apex predators, Sperm whales act as bio indicators of the health of the marine ecosystem in a toxicological context, demonstrating the effects of three key processes: bioaccumulation, biomagnification and the generation effect. These processes also make Sperm whales, and other apex predators, at greater risk from toxic pollution. Significantly, the data which was collected could be placed into the global data-set acquired during The Voyage of the Odyssey program. Ocean Alliance conducted this study for 5 years, during each summer from 2010 to 2014. For the final two years, they were joined by activist group the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, as part of a program labelled Operation Toxic Gulf. This afforded the program much more exposure than was previously possible. SnotBot SnotBot is a research program started and ran by whale and ocean health non-profit Ocean Alliance. Within this research program, Ocean Alliance use drones to collect respiratory samples (or, in essence, snot) from whales by flying the drone through the blow or spout of a whale. This spout consists of a mixture of biological and non-biological compounds from which various facets of a whale's health and ecology can be inferred. Ocean conservation group Parley for the Oceans have been the primary partners and funders of the SnotBot program. The SnotBot program was initiated in 2014, as an attempt to explore and harness the potential which drones had in whale science. At first, Ocean Alliance developed their own drones alongside researchers and students at Olin College of Engineering, before moving to consumer drones made by manufacturers such as DJI and Yuneec. The initial SnotBot expeditions were funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign, which included a campaign video featuring Star Trek and X-Men actor Sir Patrick Stewart. The first three expeditions took place in Patagonia, Argentina; The Sea of Cortez, Mexico; and Alaska, the United of America. Since then, four more expeditions have taken place: two more to the Sea of Cortez and two more to Alaska. The team have collected samples from five species of whale including blue whales, orca, gray whales, southern right whales and humpback whales The primary SnotBot team has consisted of Ocean Alliance CEO Dr. Iain Kerr, photographer and cameraman Christian Miller, Ocean Alliance Science Manager Andy Rogan and Ocean Alliance technician John Graham The program has also seen considerable attention in the press. It has been featured in two National Geographic documentaries, Earth Live and One Strange Rock; has been presented at the UN, the Singularity Global Summit, various academic conferences, trade shows and academic institutions.

The Trix Express system was first introduced at the Leipzig exhibition in the spring of 1935. It was the first reasonable priced H0 (Half Zero) Table-Top model train system using 16.5mm track (1:87). In Germany the system was marketed as Trix Express. After the Nazis forced the Jewish owners of the company Stefan Bing and others to sell their shares, they moved to Britain and founded the Trix Ltd London, which initially used the same system. This brand was called TTR - TRIX TWIN RAILWAY. sliding contact at older (above) and newer (below, only third rail) models Like other systems introduced before WW2 it used a third (centre) rail as a means to supply current to the models. Unlike other systems, such as M√§rklin H0 (still produced today) and Hornby Railways, the outer tracks were insulated, using the centre rail as a common pick-up. This allowed the independent operation of two model engines on the same track and even three if overhead catenary wires were used. The original system used 14V AC power. The German company changed to 14V DC in 1953 and used the third rail system until 2003 when the last models were produced under the auspices of the M√§rklin company. Because of a great lobby to M√§rklin, Trix Express has been re-initiated in 2013 by producing new rolling stock. The British Trix Twin company changed to DC in 1956, abandoned the three rail system in the early 1960s and disappeared altogether after a number of take-overs and mergers during the 1970s. Apart from the centre pick-up, the Trix Express system also retained the larger wheel flanges, customary in the 1930s, right till the recent end, making derailments rather uncommon, but at the same time making their rolling stock incompatible with more modern two-rail NEM systems. The Trix Express system still has a large following in countries such as United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands with active clubs and is readily available on eBay.

The summit itself is marked by a well structured Bronze Age cairn with a central burial cist like that on nearby Pen y Fan. The two summits are visible from great distances owing to their height above the surrounding moorland, and are famous landmarks. The views from the peaks are also panoramic and very extensive, the Black Mountain and Fforest Fawr being especially obvious to the west. Mynydd Epynt is visible to the north behind the county town of Brecon, and other parts of the escarpment to the east. Access The summit is often crossed on the way to Pen y Fan, and forms part of a well-known circuit of the Beacons. It offers good views down into Cwm Llwch and across the Usk valley to Brecon as well as east towards the Sugar Loaf, Monmouthshire above Abergavenny.Nuttall, John & Anne (1999). The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales (2nd edition ed.). Milnthorpe, Cumbria: Cicerone. . Tommy Jones' Obelisk is found on its western flanks, in between the summit and Y Gyrn. All of the surrounding moorland is open to access, but crossing some parts of the terrain such as peat bogs is more difficult and the main paths are well-engineered and maintained by the National Trust. Geology Corn Du showing distinctive strata and the summit cairn The summit is very similar to that of Pen y Fan: flat and anvil-shaped. It is similarly formed from the relatively erosion-resistant Devonian age sandstones from the Upper Old Red Sandstone known as the Plateau Beds. The rock strata are clearly visible at the edge of the escarpment, where they form a resistant edge to the cliff. The same strata are visible all along the escarpment facing north, as well as the rearward edge facing south-east and lying behind the main peaks. The same Plateau Beds recur in the Black Mountain (range) to the west, and cap the summits of Picws Du and Fan Foel, as well as forming steep cliffs below the peaks. The Tommy Jones obelisk with Pen y Fan (left) and Corn Du (right) Glacial lakes Summit of Corn Du Nearby is one of the few natural lakes in the park, the small Llyn Cwm Llwch. It may be compared with the much larger glacial lakes of Llyn y Fan Fach and Llyn y Fan Fawr below the main ridge of the Black Mountain about 15 miles west of the central Brecon Beacons escarpment. All three are glacial lakes and were formed during the last ice age by ice scouring out hollows below the peaks, the water being partly dammed by moraines of rock debris carried down by ice action subsequent to plucking and frost shattering.

Hilton Crowther, or more commonly simply as Hilton Crowther, was the chairman of Huddersfield Town and, subsequently, Leeds United football clubs. He was a wealthy woollen mill owner; along with his four brothers, he owned the Milnsbridge Woollen Mill in Huddersfield. In 1918 he invested a considerable sum in Huddersfield Town but the team did not prosper and Crowther was eventually bought out, focusing his energies thereafter on Leeds United. Early life John Hilton Crowther was born in September 1879 in Marsden, West Yorkshire. He was the son of Joseph Crowther, a wealthy mill owner who had moved to Marsden from Golcar in 1867.www.marsdenhistory.co.uk Retrieved January 2014 Football career=Huddersfield Town Crowther's interest in football was sparked by the distinct lack of public interest in Huddersfield Town. Since the club had achieved Football League status in 1910, their attendances had been extremely poor; up to the suspension of the League programme in 1915, home games had rarely exceeded crowds of 5,000. Contributing factors included Huddersfield's poor form - in five years of endeavour, the club's best position had been fifth in Division Two in 1912-13, and during this period they had never advanced beyond the second round of the FA Cup - and the presence of the established (and well supported) Huddersfield Northern Rugby Union Club. Playing a near-empty ground, which had been redeveloped to house over 50,000 spectators, could not have been encouraging for players, management or the club directors. Sympathetic to the club's plight, and wealthy enough to indulge himself in practically any project he chose, Crowther invested ¬£27,000 into the Huddersfield Football Club in 1918, then added a further ¬£18,000 - a huge fortune in those days. Such an act undoubtedly guaranteed Town's existence; however, in 1919 it was increasingly felt that the club should become self-sufficient, but lacked the support to achieve that state. Football League president John McKenna, cited Huddersfield's midweek home League fixture against Bury on 9 September 1919. The game realised only ¬£49 in gate money, and McKenna said that such meagre support was not conducive to any club retaining Football League membership. The crisis came to a head following the poor turn out for Huddersfield's 3-0 home win over Fulham in a Second Division match on 1 November 1919. An attendance of 2,500 paid just ¬£90 at the turnstiles, whilst gate receipts at the rugby club in the same week banked ¬£1,600. The club was simply not operating at a viable financial level. Leeds City and Leeds United At the same, Leeds City football club had been disbanded due to irregular financial payments to players, and its players were being auctioned off. There was a consistent fan base at Leeds, and a new football club - Leeds United - was formed with the long term aim of replacing the defunct Leeds City. Impressed by the activity and support of the Leeds fans, Crowther (without consulting his fellow Huddersfield directors) offered to amalgamate Huddersfield Town with the newly formed Leeds United club. In the eyes of many, Leeds had been deprived of the chance to become one of the best centres of football in Yorkshire due to the misdemeanours of the disbanded club's officials, so a meeting with the United committee to discuss the possibilities of an amalgamation was welcomed in Leeds. The request for transference of Huddersfield Town to Leeds was duly sent to the Football League. Within days of this news, a handful of Huddersfield spectators held a prolonged demonstration on the pitch in front of the directors box, demanding an explanation from the club's officials, and the Huddersfield Town board agreed to hold a further public meeting at Leeds Road the following day. A crowd of 3,000 supporters were drawn to the ground to protest at the proposed transference of their club and, encouraged by this, the Huddersfield board sent a counter request to the Football League. The eventual ruling was that Huddersfield Town would be given one month's grace, until 8 December 1919, to raise ¬£25,000, the sum of the debt deemed payable to Crowther. In return, he would forgo his interest in the club. If the money was not forthcoming, Huddersfield Town would move to Elland Road and become part of the new Leeds United. The community and various local dignitaries rallied around and, after negotiations, Crowther accepted a final payment of ¬£17,500 plus an allotment of 12,500 shares in Huddersfield Town. The club was saved from amalgamation with Leeds United. Thus, Crowther was bought out, and thereafter focused his energies on Leeds United.Maguire, John, p.25, Chelsea vs. Leeds United 1970 F.A. Cup Final Retrieved 2 January 2014 Crowther had set his heart on building the new Leeds United, and he became the new club chairman, making the club a loan of ¬£35,000, repayable when United gained promotion to the First Division. He would serve as Chairman of Leeds United from 1919 to 1924.List of Chairmen at www.mightyleeds.co.uk Retrieved 2 January 2014 Personal life In 1927 Crowther married Annie M. J.

Early life  William \\"Bill\\" Oldendorf was born in 1925, the youngest of four children, in Schenectady, New York. According to his sister Dorothy, William developed an interest in science and imaging through his fascination with telescopes. While still in high school, he placed one on the front sidewalk of their abode and studied the stars late into the night.  Academic education  Oldendorf graduated from high school at the age of 15 and afterwards attended Union College in Schenectady, New York‚Äîcompleting premedical studies in just 3 years. He received his medical degree from the Albany Medical College in Albany, New York in 1947.  Medical training  Following medical internship at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, Oldendorf completed a residency in psychiatry through the New York State Department of Mental Health Residency Training Program. Then he enlisted for active duty in the United States Navy as a medical officer and was posted at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Newport, Rhode Island. Two years later Oldendorf left the Navy to complete a fellowship in neurology at the University of Minnesota Hospitals in Minneapolis, Minnesota; for this reason, he was subsequently certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology as a diplomate in both specialties.  Professional career  In 1956, Oldendorf joined the faculty of the new medical school at the University of California, Los Angeles and the staff of the nearby UCLA-affiliated West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. He became an active member of the academic community, where his scientific, clinical, and teaching abilities were admired at the bedside, in seminars, at clinical conferences, in the auditorium, and in his laboratory. He engaged students and colleagues in long discussions about neurologic theory, the scientific process, or results of medical research. By 1959, Oldendorf was an attending neurologist at the Wadsworth VA-UCLA Medical Center where his ability to apply techniques from one field to another did not go unnoticed. He was universally characterized as \\"likable\\", \\"friendly\\", \\"amusing\\", \\"creative\\", \\"intense\\", and \\"humble\\". Oldendorf's interest neuroimaging was precipitated by a dislike for invasive procedures (like pneumoencephalography and direct carotid puncture) that he performed as a clinical neurologist. Oldendorf found that these traumatic, tedious tests provided only limited and indirect information about the brain. At UCLA, he started his seminal investigations into the two major lines of research that would define his career: X-ray shadow radiography and cerebral angiography. The first line was influential in the evolving concept of neuroimaging; the second yielded fundamental knowledge of brain metabolism and mechanisms of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.  Contributions to medical science = Role in development of neuroimaging  In 1959, Oldendorf conceived an idea for \\"scanning a head through a transmitted beam of X-rays, and being able to reconstruct the radiodensity patterns of a plane through the head\\" by watching an engineer who was working on an automated apparatus to reject frostbitten fruit by detecting dehydrated portions. Not until 1961 did he complete a working prototype of his idea, apply (for $1700) for a patent on his idea, and publish an article detailing the work. Ingeniously, by using materials found in his home (such as his son's toy train, a phonograph turntable, and an alarm clock motor), Oldendorf demonstrated a method of producing cross-sectional images of soft tissue by back-projection and reconstruction. In his landmark paper, also published in 1961, he described the basic concept later used by Allan McLeod Cormack to develop the mathematics behind computerized tomography, though Prof. Cormack was unaware of Oldendorf's work. In October, 1963 Oldendorf finally received a U.S. patent for a \\"radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material,\\". This work was recognized by Godfrey Hounsfield as the only other attempt at tomographic reconstruction, and, indeed, formed the basis of much of his Nobel prize-winning work. The prototype developed by Dr. Oldendorf, however, did not lead to the development of the first industrial CAT scanning device. When suggested to a leading X-ray manufacturer of the time, the president of the company retorted, Faced with this reaction, Oldendorf \\"turned his attention to other scientific work and heard nothing further about the idea until 1972.\\" However, his idea was a fundamental discovery which also led to MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and other imaging techniques. Once these techniques became widely accepted, Dr. Oldendorf, along with William Markley McKinney, MD (1930‚Äì2003) were instrumental in promoting the use of Computed Tomography among neurologists to help decrease the use of superfluous and invasive tests.  Blood‚Äìbrain barrier  Oldendorf made many other discoveries that have significantly affected neuroscience and the practice of medicine. He developed an original method to analyze blood flow in the brain and the kinetics of blood-brain permeability. The idea of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier was already entrenched in medical science by this time, but had never been quantified. Oldendorf's work in measuring blood flow with radioactive isotopes was fundamental to the subsequent development of techniques now used in many nuclear medicine laboratories. His methods of assessing blood‚Äìbrain barrier permeability increased knowledge of the mechanisms whereby drugs and metabolic substrates enter into the brain. Especially important was his characterization of more than a dozen independent carrier systems, along with their saturation kinetics. Today, most of what is known of the selective permeability of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier was either established by Oldendorf in his laboratory, or by others using his ingenious techniques. These results have been essential in developing PET and SPECT imaging; in studying glucose transport and brain metabolism; and in characterizing clinically important diseases such as cerebral ischemia, starvation, and epilepsy. Oldendorf's experiments were also was the first to prove that cerebrospinal fluid functions as a \\"sink\\" in relationship to brain metabolism, a concept that is being investigated in relation to the pathophysiology of presenile dementias such as Alzheimer's disease.  Professional publications and societies  In his lifetime, Oldendorf wrote three textbooks and over 250 scientific articles, including The Quest for an Image of the Brain: Computerized Tomography in the Perspective of Past and Future Imaging Methods (Raven Press, New York, 1980) and Basics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Kluwer Academic Press, Boston, 1988). The book Basics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging is notable for being co-authored with his son and namesake, William Oldendorf, Jr. Oldendorf was one of the 30 attendees of the Neurology Computed Tomography Symposium, organized by William Kinkel from September 24 to September 25, 1975, in Buffalo, New York. He participated in the ad hoc committee that unanimously voted to form the Society for Computerized Tomography so as to continue its educational activities. Realizing that other imaging modalities may eventually be prominent, the following year Oldendorf pushed to have the name of the society changed to Society for Computerized Tomography and Neuroimaging, and served as its president from 1978 to 1979. This society was to rename itself the American Society for Neuroimaging (ASN) in 1981, also with the prodding of Oldendorf. Oldendorf was on several editorial boards and was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1992, he became the first neurologist ever to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences.  Awards and prizes  In 1974, he shared the Ziedses des Plantes Gold Medal (given by the German Society of Neuroradiology and the Medical Physics Society of Wurzburgin) with Godfrey Hounsfield. Oldendorf was also awarded the Albert and Mary Lasker Award for Clinical Research in 1975 along with Prof. Hounsfield for \\"concepts and experiments which directly anticipated and demonstrated the feasibility of computerized tomography, which has revolutionized the field of neurological diagnosis\\". He received a Special Leadership Award from the American Academy of Neurology in 1980 for \\"contributions to clinical neurology, including computerized tomographic scanning, studies on the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, and research on cerebral metabolism.\\" In 1981 he received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service and the Medical Sciences Award from the UCLA Alumni Association. Oldendorf was also * Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (1986), * Distinguished Founder of the American Board of Nuclear Medicine Science, * Honorary Doctorate of Science (1982) from Albany Medical College and Union College, * Honorary Doctorate of Science (1986) from St. Louis University, and * Keynote Speaker at the annual meeting of the Japanese Society of Neuroradiology in Tokyo in February, 1990  Nobel Prize controversy  Despite all his contributions to medical science, and despite the awards won in conjunction with the other eventual winners, Oldendorf was not awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with his colleagues Godfrey Hounsfield and Allan Cormack in 1979. This was in concordance with the Nobel committee's tradition of denying the prize to researchers in applied research (who have M.D. degrees) in favor of researchers in the basic sciences (who have Ph.D. degrees). Rosalyn Yalow, a Nobel laureate herself, nominated Oldendorf for the prize and was reportedly upset that he did not get it. In the January 1980 issue of the journal Science (vol. 207, page 31), William J. Broad wrote an article titled \\"The Riddle of the Nobel Debate\\" in which he posited that politics in Stockholm forced the removal of Dr. Oldendorf's name during the nomination process. It was theorized that giving the prize to another American could sway pending patent litigation in Europe over the rights to the CT Scanner.  Death and legacy  Despite the controversy over the Nobel Prize, Oldendorf was remarkably aplomb about the issue. He was supposed to have remarked He died unexpectedly on December 14, 1992 from the complications of heart disease. In his eulogy, L. Jolyon West (Chairman of Psychiatry at UCLA) stated, He was survived by his wife, Stella Oldendorf, three sons, and the implications of his work which are still being investigated. In his honor, The Oldendorf Award is given annually by the American Society of Neuroimaging based on the submission of a manuscript that involves clinical research in computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, SPECT or PET scanning.

While the sun touches the horizon, a Liljequist parhelion is located approximately 160¬∞ from the sun and is about 10¬∞ long. As the sun rises up to 30¬∞ the phenomenon gradually moves towards 150¬∞, and as the sun reaches over 30¬∞ the optical effect vanishes. The parhelia are caused by light rays passing through oriented plate crystals. Like the 120¬∞ parhelia, the Liljequist parhelia display a white-bluish colour. This colour is, however, associated with the parhelic circle itself, not the ice crystals causing the Liljequist parhelia. The phenomenon was first observed by G√∂sta Hjalmar Liljequist in 1951 at Maudheim, Antarctica during the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition in 1949‚Äì1952. It was then simulated by Dr. Eberhard Tr√§nkle (1937‚Äì1997) and Robert Greenler in 1987 and theoretically explained by Walter Tape in 1994. A theoretical and experimental investigation of the Liljequist parhelion caused by perfect hexagonal plate crystals showed that the azimuthal position of maximum intensity occurs at \\\\theta_{{\\\\rm L}1}=2\\\\arccos\\\\left(n\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3} - \\\\alpha_{\\\\rm TIR}\\\\right)\\\\right), where the refractive index n to use for the angle \\\\alpha_{\\\\rm TIR}=\\\\arcsin(1/n) of total internal reflection is Bravais' index for inclined rays, i.e. n(e)=\\\\sqrt{n^2-\\\\sin\\\\left(e\\\\right)^2}/\\\\cos\\\\left(e\\\\right) for a solar elevation e.

Some versions were built in Canada by the Canada Car and Foundry Co Ltd  British variants=Hurricane Mk I ; Hurricane Mk I (Early production) Mk I with original two-bladed propeller, in France circa 1939 The first Mk I production machines were ready fairly quickly, with deliveries starting in December 1937. These early aircraft featured fabric-covered wings, and a wooden, two-bladed, fixed-pitch propeller. Initially the tailwheel was designed to be retractable; early on it was discovered that the Hurricane needed a larger rudder area to improve the control characteristics during a spin. To this end the lower part of the rudder was extended and a distinctive ventral \\"keel\\" was added to the rear fuselage. The tailwheel was now fixed. Early Hurricanes lacked armour or self- sealing tanks. They used \\"ring and bead\\" gunsights, with the ring being mounted above the instrument panel and the bead mounted on a post above the engine cowling. The standard GM2 reflector gunsight was introduced in mid-1939, although many Hurricanes retained the \\"bead\\". Fuel capacity was 97 Imperial gal (441 l) in two fuel tanks, each of 34.5 gal (157 l) in the wing centre-section, between the spars; the fuel was pumped from these into a reserve gravity-feed tank which held an additional 28 gal (127 l) in the forward fuselage, just ahead of the cockpit. This was the main fuel feed to the engine. The 7 gal (32 l) oil tank was built into the forward, port centre section. Early \\"K\\" serialled Mk Is were powered by the 1,029 hp (768 kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin C engine; from the \\"L\\" serial numbers the later Merlin II of 1,030 hp (768 kW) was installed. The main coolant radiator was housed in a fairing under the rear wing centre-section; the oil cooler was also incorporated into the main radiator. Hurricane Mk.I R4118 is the only Hurricane from the 1940 Battle of Britain still flying The aircraft handling qualities during take-off and landings were excellent due to a wide-track undercarriage with relatively wide low-pressure tyres. Because of this wide, stable platform the Hurricane was an easier aircraft to land, with less fear of nose-overs or \\"ground-loops\\" than its RAF Fighter Command counterpart the Supermarine Spitfire. During its operational life the Hurricane was able to operate from all sorts of adverse airfield surfaces with ease.Hurricane Operational Characteristics; report 1938 Retrieved: 4 April 2008 In flight the large, thick wing meant that the fighter proved to be a stable gun platform. It was armed with eight .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. The armament was arranged in two lots of four in large gunbays incorporated into the outer wing panels. In 1937 this firepower was enough to outgun the early marks of German Messerschmitt Bf 109, which were equipped with only four light machine guns. By the time of the Battle of Britain, however, it was recognised that this relatively small-calibre armament was inadequate; during the Battle of Britain it was relatively common for Luftwaffe aircraft to survive numerous hits from .303 in (7.7 mm) bullets and still return safely to base. Later versions of the Hurricane were equipped with a more powerful arms package, initially 12 .303 in (7.7 mm) Brownings, and later four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano cannon. Hurricanes built under licence by SABCA in Belgium featured four 12.7 mm (.50 in) FN-Browning guns instead of the .303 inch armament. ;Hurricane MkI (Mid-late production) Another view of Hurricane I (R4118), a typical Battle of Britain style Mk I with a de Havilland propeller unit In 1939, several changes were made to the Hurricane. The powerplant was changed to the Merlin III driving a de Havilland or RotolNote: The Rotol propeller units were identical to those used on the Spitfire Mk II, including the blunt, rounded spinner. Later Rotol equipped Hurricane Is and Mk IIs used a longer, pointed spinner shape. constant speed metal propeller. Ejector exhaust stacks were fitted for added thrust. The fabric covered wings were replaced by re-stressed metal- covered wings. An armour-glass panel was incorporated on the front of the windscreen. The \\"rod\\" aerial mast was replaced by a streamlined, tapered design. From about May 1940 70 pounds of armour plate protection was added in the form of head and back armour. Starting in September 1940, IFF equipment was installed. This weighed about 40 lb (18 kg) and could be identified by wire aerials strung between the tailplane tips and rear fuselage. Although the added weight and the aerials reduced maximum speed by about 2 mph (3 km/h), it allowed the aircraft to be identified as \\"friendly\\" on radar: lack of such equipment was a factor leading to the Battle of Barking Creek. At about the same time new VHF T/R Type 1133 radios started replacing the HF TR9 sets. The pilots enjoyed a much clearer reception, which was a big advantage with the adoption of Wing formations throughout the RAF in 1941. The new installation meant that the wire running between the aerial mast and rudder could be removed, as could the triangular \\"prong\\" on the mast. At the start of the war the engine ran on the standard 87 octane aviation spirit. From March 1940 increasing quantities of 100 octane fuel, imported from the US, became available. This meant that during the defensive battles over Dunkirk the Hurricane Is benefited from an allowable increase in supercharger \\"boost\\" from 6 lb to 12 lb without damaging the engine. With the 12 lb \\"emergency boost\\", the Merlin III was able to generate 1,305 hp (973 kW) in a five-minute burst. If the pilot resorted to emergency boost, he had to report this on landing and it had to be noted in the engine log book.Report by P/O John Bushell, 151 Squadron 18 May 1940.Retrieved: 6 April 2008 In 1939, the RAF had taken on about 500 of this later design to form the backbone of the fighter squadrons during the Battle of France and into the Battle of Britain. The first RAF ace of the war, a young New Zealander known as \\"Cobber\\" Kain, flew a Hurricane with No. 73 Squadron. In June 1940, another wartime ace, Douglas Bader, was promoted to Squadron Leader and took command of No. 242 (Canadian) Squadron flying Hurricane Mk Is.Bader 2004, p. 16. The famous children's author Roald Dahl also flew Hurricanes with No. 80 Squadron in Greece and later in Syria, against the Germans and Vichy France.Dahl, Roald. Going Solo. London: Puffin Books, 2001. . Although some of the basic design elements of the aircraft were from an earlier generation, the Hurricane proved to be a match, to an extent, for the Luftwaffes Messerschmitt Bf 109E. In his book, Duel of Eagles, British ace Peter Townsend, who flew Hurricanes with No. 85 Squadron RAF during the Battle of Britain, provides examples demonstrating how the Hurricane's superior turning ability could offset the Bf 109's higher speed. This small turning circle often allowed a well flown Hurricane to get onto the tail of a 109 even more quickly than a Spitfire, assuming a 109 pilot was unwise enough to be lured into a turning match. Against the Hurricane was the aircraft's relatively slow acceleration and a top speed some 10‚Äì30 mph (16‚Äì48 km/h) slower, depending on altitude. This meant that the 109 pilot often held the initiative when it came to breaking off or attacking during combat. At higher altitudes especially, the Hurricane was hard-pressed to keep up with a well flown 109, or even a Bf 110.Bungay, 2000, pp 266‚Äì267 Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Hurricane IIC (LF363) Lower down the situation was a little more even. The Rolls-Royce Merlin engine gave more power at low altitude than the Daimler-Benz DB 601 used in the Bf 109, on account of a different supercharger design. The DB601A-1 did not start to outperform the Merlin III and XII until above 15,000 ft (4,572 m). The Merlin's only major drawback was a tendency to cut out during negative-g manoeuvres and inverted flight, on account of fuel starvation from the carburettor. This was temporarily fixed with \\"Miss Shilling's orifice\\", a simple modification. A direct- injection carburettor later solved the problem and eventually some versions of the Merlin used direct fuel injection. When attacking Luftwaffe bombers, it was discovered that the Hurricane's fuel tanks were vulnerable to defensive machine gun fire. The greatest hazard was with the unprotected gravity-feed fuel tank in front of the cockpit which could rupture when hit, allowing a jet of flame to penetrate the cockpit through the instrument panel, causing serious burn injuries to the pilot. The wooden and fabric rear fuselage was also far more likely to catch fire than the metal fuselages of its contemporaries. This issue was of such concern to Air Vice Marshal Hugh Dowding that he had Hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of Hurricanes with a fire-resistant material called \\"Linatex\\" as a matter of priority. The wing tanks had already been fitted with a covering of this sealant, but the fuselage tank was considered to be too small a target. Hurricanes were soon being modified at the rate of 75 per month. In one month of combat, 10 July 1940 to 11 August, defensive fire from bombers hit 25 Hurricanes and 25 Spitfires; as a result 11 Hurricanes were shot down compared with two Spitfires.Bungay, 2000, pp 196‚Äì198, 266‚Äì267 The biggest advantages of the Hurricane were that it was a relatively easy aircraft to fly, which was a boon when it came to squadrons being flooded with inexperienced pilots, and it was a steady gun platform. The closely grouped .303 in (7.7 mm) Brownings created a superior pattern of fire to those of the Spitfire, which were spaced out along the wings, and the armament was more quickly serviced. In spite of its vulnerabilities during the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane shot down the majority of the planes claimed by the RAF (1,593 out of 2,739 in total). Hurricane fighters were sometimes directed against slower bombers whilst the Spitfires attacked German fighters. By the close of the Battle of Britain in late 1940, production of the Spitfire had increased to the point where all squadrons could be supplied with them. In June 1940, the first Hurricane Mk I \\"Tropical\\" versions appeared. These featured a Vokes air filter in a large \\"chin\\" fairing under the engine cowling. Many of these aircraft were ferried to North Africa and Malta via France and the Mediterranean using fixed, cylindrical 40 gallon fuel tanks under each wing to extend the range. The tropical filter and fuel tanks were to be used on later variants of the Hurricane. Hurricane Mk II Hawker Hurricane IIA at the National Museum of the United States Air Force The improved Merlin XX (Mk.20) engine appeared in 1940 featuring a new two-speed supercharger that could have its impeller speed changed by the pilot depending on the outside air pressure (altitude). At about (effective), it would be switched to a higher speed gearing (\\"FS ratio\\" ‚Äì Full Supercharge) for added compression, while below that, at its lower speed gearing, (\\"MS ratio\\" ‚Äì Moderate Supercharge), it \\"robbed\\" less power from the engine. The result was more power at both lower and higher altitudes, dramatically increasing the overall performance of the engine, peaking at . Because of the new engine the bay immediately in front of the cockpit was lengthened by . The carburettor air intake under the forward centre-section was redesigned and moved back . The more powerful engine was cooled by a 70% to 30% water glycol mix, rather than pure glycol used for earlier Merlin versions. This and the increased cooling requirements required a larger radiator and a redesigned, circular oil cooler housed in a deeper, slightly wider \\"bath\\". =Hurricane IIA Series 1= Although, by this time, production of the Spitfire had started to increase, a Merlin XX powered Hurricane Mk I was built and first flew on 11 June 1940. The initial Mark II, later known as the Mark IIA Series 1, went into squadron service in September 1940 at the peak of the Battle of Britain. Hawker had long experimented with improving the armament of the fighter by fitting cannons. Their first experiments used two 20 mm (.79 in) Oerlikon cannons in pods, one under each wing, (one aircraft was tested during 1940 with 151 SquadronNote: This aircraft, referred to as the \\"heavy old cow\\", was used by Flt Lt Dick Smith of 151 Squadron on 18 August 1940. Price, 1979, p 22, 41, 156.) but the extra weight and drag seriously compromised the aircraft's performance and manoeuvreability, and the limited amount of ammunition carried coupled with the frequent stoppages suffered by the drum- fed guns, meant the arrangement was unsatisfactory. A more reliable fit was made with four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk II cannons, two in each wing, but the weight was enough to seriously reduce performance. The Hispanos were designed for a rigid, engine based mounting and it was quickly found that the wings flexing in flight led to problems with the weapons twisting in their mounts as they fired, which caused gun jamming through misaligned shells. Changes made both to the Hispanos and to their mountings cured this problem. Small blisters on the upper wing surfaces were needed to clear the Hispano breeches and feed motors. The first sets of Hispano wings were modified from standard Mark I eight gun wings. =Hurricane IIA Series 2 (Hurricane IIB)= Mk IIB showing six machine guns on right wing With the new Merlin XX, performance was good enough to keep the ageing Hurricane in production. Hawker soon introduced the new Mark IIA Series 2 with either of two wings; one mounting 12 Brownings, the other with four Hispano cannon in the original gun-bays. The first Series 2s, armed with 12 .303 in (7.7 mm) Brownings (four per wing in the original gun- bays and two more in new gun-bays outboard of the landing lights) arrived in October. These Mk IIA Series IIs also featured a new longer propeller spinner and later become the Mark IIB in April 1941. The tailwheel recess on the ventral keel was changed in shape and the tailwheel leg became a levered- suspension unit with a small torque link. =Hurricane IIB Trop.= For use in North Africa; the Hawker Hurricane IIB, (and other aircraft), were tropicalised, or \\"trop\\". They were given engine dust filters and the pilots were issued a desert survival kit. =Hurricane IIC= The Hurricane IIA Series 2s armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispanos become the Mark IIC in June 1941, using a slightly modified wing. The new wings also included a hardpoint for a 500 lb (227 kg) or 250 lb (113 kg) bomb, and later in 1941, fixed 40 gal (182 l) fuel tanks. By then performance was inferior to the latest German fighters, and the Hurricane changed to the ground-attack role, sometimes referred to as the Hurribomber. The mark also served as a night fighter and \\"intruder.\\" =Hurricane IID= A Mark IID Hurricane of 6 Squadron at Shandur, Egypt (1942) Mk IIs were used in ground support, where it was quickly learned that destroying German tanks was difficult; the cannons did not have the performance needed, while bombing the tanks was almost impossible. The solution was to equip the aircraft with a 40 mm cannon in a pod under each wing, reducing the other armament to a single Browning in each wing loaded with tracers for aiming purposes. The Hurricanes No. 6 Squadron, the first squadron equipped with this armament, were so effective that the squadron was nicknamed the \\"Flying Can Openers\\". A winged can-opener became an unofficial squadron emblem, and is painted on present-day aircraft of 6 Squadron. The layout was originally tested on a converted Mk IIB and flew on 18 September 1941. A new-build version of what was known as the Mk IID started in 1942, including additional armour for the pilot, radiator and engine. The aircraft were initially supplied with a Rolls-Royce gun and carried 12 rounds, but soon changed to the 40 mm (1.57 in) Vickers S gun with 15 rounds. The weight of guns and armour protection had a marginal effect on the aircraft's performance. The IID was used in anti-tank operations in limited numbers during the North African campaign where, provided enemy flak and fighters were absent, they proved accurate and highly effective against armoured vehicles and all motor transport. =Hurricane IIE= Another wing modification was introduced in the Mk IIE, but the changes soon became extensive enough that it was renamed the Mk IV after the first 250 had been delivered. =Hurricane T.IIC= The T Mk IIC was a two-seat training version of the Mk. IIC. Only two aircraft were built for the Persian Air Force.l Hurricane Mk III The Mk III was a Mk II equipped with a Packard- built Merlin engine, intending to provide supplies of the British-built engines for other designs. By the time production was to have started, Merlin production had increased to the point where the idea was abandoned. Hurricane Mk IV RP-3 rockets The last major change to the Hurricane was to \\"rationalise\\" the wing, configuring it with a single design able to mount two bombs, two 40 mm (1.57 in) Vickers S guns, or eight \\"60 pounder\\" RP-3 rockets. Some sources say that the new design also mounted the improved Merlin 24 or 27 engines of 1,620 hp (1,208 kW) but this is disputed. They were equipped with dust filters for desert operations and an additional 350 lb (159 kg) of armour plating was added to the radiator housing, cockpit and fuel tanks. The Mk IV was used in ground-attack missions in the European theatre until the early days of 1944, before being replaced by the more modern Hawker Typhoon. French ace Pierre Clostermann recalls in his book, The Big Show, that RP-3-equipped Hurricanes were limited to 205 mph (330 km/h) top speed due to the rockets' drag, and that Hurricane casualty rates against the lethal German flak were extremely high. In particular, Clostermann describes a rocket attack by Hurricanes from No. 184 Squadron RAF against a V-1 flying bomb launch-site on the French coast on 20 December 1943, in which three of the four aircraft were shot down before they could attack. Hurricane Mk V Two Hurricane Mk Vs were built as conversions of Mk IVs, and featured a Merlin 32 engine driving a four-bladed propeller. As the ground attack role moved to the more capable Hawker Typhoon, production of the Hurricane ended, and only a handful were delivered with the Merlin 32. By this time, the Hurricane was no longer a frontline fighter in the United Kingdom. However, it still saw extensive service overseas as a fighter, playing a prominent role in the Middle East and Far East. It was also critical to the defence of Malta during 1941 and early 1942.

Sea Hurricanes Sea Hurricane Mk IA Hawker Sea Hurricane Mk.Ib (Z7015) arrives at the 2016 RIAT, England :The Sea Hurricane Mk IA was a Hurricane Mk I modified by General Aircraft Limited. They were modified to be carried by CAM ships (catapult armed merchantman). These were cargo ships equipped with a catapult for launching an aircraft, but without facilities to recover them. Thus, if the aircraft were not in range of a land base, pilots were forced to bail out and be picked up by the ship. They were informally known as \\"Hurricats\\". :The majority of the aircraft modified had suffered wear-and-tear from serving with front-line squadrons, so much so that at least one example used during trials broke up under the stress of a catapult launching. A total of 50 aircraft were converted from Hurricane Mk Is. CAM launched Hurricanes were used on eight operational sorties and the Hurricanes shot down six enemy aircraft, for the loss of one Hurricane pilot killed.Brown, Eric, Wings of the Navy, p112 The first Sea Hurricane IA kill was an Fw 200C Condor, shot down on 2 August 1941.Brown, Eric, Wings of the Navy, p109 Sea Hurricane Mk IB Sea Hurricanes Mk IB in formation, December 1941 :Hurricane Mk I version equipped with catapult spools plus an arrester hook.Brown, Eric, Wings of the Navy, p114 From July 1941 they operated from and from October 1941, they were used on Merchant aircraft carrier (MAC ships), which were large cargo vessels with a flight deck enabling aircraft to be launched and recovered. A total of 340 aircraft were converted. The first Sea Hurricane IB kill occurred on 31 July 1941, when Sea Hurricanes of 880 squadron, operating from HMS Furious shot down a Do 18 flying-boat.Thetford, Owen, British Naval Aircraft since 1912, p228. The Fleet Air Arm preferred the lighter de Havilland propellers over the Rotol types; it was found during tests that the Rotol unit could lead to the nose dipping during arrested landings, causing the propeller blades to \\"peck\\" the carrier deck. The lighter de Havilland units avoided this problem. Sea Hurricane Mk IC :Hurricane Mk IBrown, Eric, Wings of the Navy, p114 version equipped with catapult spools, an arrester hook and the four-cannon wing. From February 1942, 400 aircraft were converted.

Biology The site is important for its plants and provides one of the best examples of species-rich upland ledge communities in West Cumbria. It supports a mixture of montane and lowland species. Management English Nature (the predecessor organisation of Natural England) identified a need to control grazing stock and to manage human access. In 2011 Natural England successfully prosecuted Honister Slate Mine for damaging the SSSI. The mine had been redeveloped by a local businessman as a tourist attraction, and the facilities included an unapproved extension to an existing via ferrata and a zip wire. It was noted their use by paying members of the public caused significant damage to the vegetation through trampling. In November 2018 the Lake District National Park approved a planning application from the Slate Mine for a zip wire running 1 km from Fleetwith Pike (a longer wire than the one which was the subject of controversy in 2011)). The Cumbria Wildlife Trust expressed concern that damage would be caused to alpine flowers. Geology There are important exposures of rocks of the Skiddaw Group in contact with lavas and tuffs of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. Management According to English Nature, the \\"ideal management for natural inland geological sites is the maintenance of rock exposure free of vegetation and, in some cases, the build-up of rock debris\\". Other levels of protection=Special Area of Conservation Since 2005 the SSSI has been protected under the Habitats Directive (European Union legislation) as part of the multi-site Special Area of Conservation known as Lake District High Fells. This designation is for the site's biological rather than geological interest. The SAC also includes Buttermere Fells SSSI. World Heritage Site The SSSI is within the Lake District National Park, which was designated a World Heritage Site in 2017 as a cultural landscape.

Reniero Zeno (Venetian: Renieri Zen) (died July 7, 1268) was the 45th Doge of Venice, reigning from January 1, 1253 until his death in 1268. Life The first references to Zeno in historical sources describe him as a diplomat in France and Italy, where he was excommunicated for having pushed Bologna to avoid paying tributes to the Papal States. In 1240 he helped Doge Jacopo Tiepolo during the siege of Ferrara, in 1242 put down a revolt in Zara and in 1244 he was named capitano generale da Mar (fleet commander) of the Republic of Venice. He was also the podest√† (Chief Magistrate) of numerous Italian cities. After the death of Marino Morosini, Zeno, who was then podest√† of Fermo, was elected Doge with 21 out of 41 votes. In 1256‚Äì1259 he, already lifted from the excommunication, helped Pope Alexander IV and Treviso in the war for the Marca Trevigiana against the Ghibelline warlord Ezzelino IV da Romano, whose death resolved the conflict. In the meantime, Venice found itself engaged in a war against the Republic of Genoa, its greatest rival in the Mediterranean. The cause of the conflict was the sacking by the Genoese of the Venetian quarter in Tyre. When the future Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo destroyed the Genoese fleet in 1257, Genoa allied with Michael VIII Palaeologus, who in 1261 captured Constantinople, putting an end to the Latin Empire and awarding Genoans the privileges formerly held by Venetians. Venice replied by building a large fleet which again defeated the Genoese in Settepozzi in 1263. In 1268 a five-year truce was signed with Byzantine Empire which restored to the Venetians many of their former priviliegies, establishing an uneasy balance between the two maritime republics, allowing them to compete freely in the Levant. Also, under Zeno's reign a series of 129 law articles were approved which gave Venice a modern maritime legislation. Zeno died in Venice in 1268. His dogaressa was Loicia da Prata, described as beautiful and charitable. Staley, Edgcumbe: The dogaressas of Venice : The wives of the doges. London : T. W. Laurie He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.

Chakrabarty. Early life Ananda (generally called \\"Al\\" by scientific colleagues) Chakrabarty was born in Sainthia on 4 April 1938. He attended Sainthia High School, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira and St. Xavier's College, Calcutta‚Äîin that order‚Äîduring the course of his undergraduate education. Prof. Chakrabarty received his Ph.D. from the University of Calcutta in Kolkata, West Bengal in 1965.  Scientific work  Prof. Chakrabarty genetically engineered a new species of Pseudomonas bacteria (\\"the oil-eating bacteria\\") in 1971 while working for the Research & Development Center at General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York. At the time, four known species of oil-metabolizing bacteria were known to exist, but when introduced into an oil spill, they competed with each other, limiting the amount of crude oil that they degraded. The genes necessary to degrade oil were carried on plasmids, which could be transferred among species. By irradiating the transformed organism with UV light after plasmid transfer, Prof. Chakrabarty discovered a method for genetic cross-linking that fixed all four plasmid genes in place and produced a new, stable, bacterial species (now called Pseudomonas putida) capable of consuming oil one or two orders of magnitude faster than the previous four strains of oil-eating microbes. The new microbe, which Chakrabarty called \\"multiplasmid hydrocarbon-degrading Pseudomonas,\\" could digest about two-thirds of the hydrocarbons that would be found in a typical oil spill. The bacteria drew international attention when he applied for a patent‚Äîthe first U.S. patent for a genetically modified organism. (U.S. utility patents had been granted to living organisms before, including two pure bacterial cultures, patented by Louis Pasteur. Chakrabarty's modified bacterium was granted a patent in the U.K. before the U.S. patent came through.) He was initially denied the patent by the Patent Office because the patent code was thought to preclude patents on living organisms. The United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals overturned the decision in Chakrabarty's favor, writing: Sidney A. Diamond, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, then appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court case was argued on 17 March 1980 and decided on 16 June 1980. This patent was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court (Diamond v. Chakrabarty), in a 5-4 decision, when it determined: Prof. Chakrabarty's landmark research has since paved the way for many patents on genetically modified micro-organisms and other life forms, and catapulted him into the international spotlight.  Last work  His lab worked on elucidating the role of bacterial cupredoxins and cytochromes in cancer regression and arresting cell cycle progression. These proteins have been formerly known for their involvement in bacterial electron transport. He isolated a bacterial protein, azurin, with potential antineoplastic properties. He expanded his lab's work to include multiple microbiological species, including Neisseria, Plasmodia, and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. In 2001, Prof. Chakrabarty founded a company, CDG Therapeutics, (incorporated in Delaware) which holds proprietary information related to five patents generated by his work at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The University of Illinois owns the rights to the patents, but has issued exclusive licences to CDG Therapeutics. In 2008, Prof. Chakrabarty co-founded a second biopharmaceutical discovery company, Amrita Therapeutics Ltd., registered in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, to develop therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics effective against cancers and/or other major public health threats derived from bacterial products found in the human body.Amritatherapeutics.com Amrita Therapeutics Ltd. received initial funding in late 2008 from Gujarat Venture Finance Limited, and later received a grant for a two-year research program in 2010 from the Indian Department of Biotechnology under the Biotechnology Industry Promotion Program (BIPP).  Academic career  Chakrabarty was a Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. Apart from being an eminent scientist, Ananda Chakrabarty has been an advisor to judges, governments, and the UN. As one of the founding members of a United Nations Industrial Development Organization committee that proposed the establishment of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, he has been a member of its Council of Scientific Advisors ever since. He has served the U.S. government as a member of NIH Study Sections, a member of the Board on Biology of the National Academy of Science, and the Committee on Biotechnology of the National Research Council. He has also served the Stockholm Environment Institute of Sweden. He has been on the scientific advisory boards of many academic institutions such as the Michigan Biotechnology Institute, the Montana State University Center for Biofilm Engineering, the Center for Microbial Ecology at the Michigan State University, and the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Dr. Chakrabarty has also served as a member of the NATO Industrial Advisory Group based in Brussels, Belgium. He was a member of the board of directors of Einstein Institute for Science, Health and the Courts, where he participated in judicial education. For his work in genetic engineering technology, he was awarded the civilian Padma Shri by the government of India in 2007.

In municipal terms, the commune was merged with Dinant in 1965. Either it or Dinant was the birthplace of the first specialist landscape painter, Joachim Patinir (d. 1524). The Spanish House at BouvignesIn medieval times there was a lot of conflict between Bouvignes and neighbouring town of Dinant, on the opposite bank of the river, and at this point Bouvignes was a fortified town. This hostility was due to the townspeople of Bouvignes being linked to the Church of Namur and those of Dinant being linked to the Church of Liege. In 1320, on a high rock cliff next to the town, Cr√®vec≈ìur Castle was constructed to build up the defences of Bouvignes during the hostilities. The castle was modified during the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1554 King Henry II of France sacked both Bouvignes and Dinant, and went on to besiege Cr√®vec≈ìur Castle in Bouvignes. The castle held out, with leadership of the defence being taken over by the wives of three officers, but eventually the fighting ceased because the defenders had run out of ammunition. At this, the three wives threw themselves hand-in-hand off the castle walls, preferring to die than to be captured. Cr√®vec≈ìur Castle is now freely accessible, offering beautiful views over the river and scenery.

The story revolves around a twenty-year-old lesbian named Francesca who falls in love with her female philosophy professor in junior college. Francesca eventually moves to San Francisco in order to be with her. The novel explores Francesca's difficulty with intimate relationships, as she experiences numerous lesbian relationships in San Francisco. The title of the book is a reference to the San Franciscan IHOP restaurant where she is employed. Plot The IHOP Papers follows the life of Francesca, a disgruntled twenty-year-old virgin lesbian, originally from Southern California who falls in love with her female junior college professor, Irene. After spending some time together, Irene tells Francesca of her plan to undertake a sabbatical in San Francisco, a move that will involve residing with two of her former students‚Äîa man and a woman‚Äîwho are both Irene's lovers. After revealing her amorous feelings to Irene in a letter, Francesca decides to follow her to San Francisco. In San Francisco, Francesca moves in with Irene and her lovers, Jenny and Gustavo, in an apartment they have nicknamed \\"Simplicity House,\\" where simple living and nonviolence are practiced. Initially unemployed, Francesca proceeds to search for a job and becomes a hostess at an IHOP; she is quickly promoted to a waitressing position. After a month in San Francisco, Francesca leaves Simplicity House in order to have her own apartment. The remainder of the story follows Francesca and her intense love for Irene. Along the way, while still in love with Irene, Francesca falls in love with other women, including Jenny, Maria, Francesca's Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, and at least two other women. A significant portion of the book is devoted to Francesca's loathing for job, especially her uniform. The novel is written in first-person from Francesca's perspective. She is portrayed as writing the story in her apartment after her relocation to San Francisco. Characters Francesca: The story's protagonist, Francesca is a twenty-year-old lesbian who falls in love with her female philosophy professor and moves to San Francisco to be with her. Irene: A woman in her late-twenties who works as a philosophy professor at a junior college in Southern California, Irene takes a sabbatical to San Francisco, where she lives with two of her former students (and current lovers). Jenny: A lesbian around the same age as Francesca, Jenny lives with Irene as one of her two lovers when the story begins. Gustavo: Gustavo is another one of Irene's former students, and one of her two current lovers. Maria: Maria is Francesca's Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, whom Francesca also falls in love with. Tom and Theresa: Tom and Theresa are Francesca's parents. Theresa constantly worries about her. Reception The IHOP Papers received a positive review in Publishers Weekly. The reviewer called the novel \\"a coming- of-age coming-out in the tradition of Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle\\" with \\"strikingly lyrical moments in an otherwise frank narrative of a writer teetering between adolescence and adulthood.\\" Writing for Booklist, said Liebegott's book had \\"an easy charm sure to win her fans.\\" In a review by Entertainment Weekly, Katia Hetter commented, \\"Francesca's reminders that she's 'writing' the book can get annoying, but her story is a vivid reminder of how painful diner meals and coming out can be.\\" The San Diego Union-Tribune said the novel was \\"for everyone who's been a struggling, syrup-stained, chain-smoking, journal-writing, romantic fool, lesbian or otherwise.\\" Authors Michelle Tea, Eileen Myles, and Sarah Shun-lien contributed positive comments for the novel's front and back covers. The novel won the Ferro-Grumley Award for LGBT Literature in 2008.

Early life St Aubyn was the son of Sir Edward St Aubyn, 1st Baronet, of St Michael's Mount, Cornwall, and his wife Emma (n√©e Knollys), daughter of General William Knollys. He was educated at Eton, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. St Aubyn was Hon. Colonel of the 3rd Bttn Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Cornwall, and Deputy Special Warden of the Stannaries.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 He was president of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall from 1891‚Äì92. Parliamentary service St Aubyn was elected Member of Parliament for Cornwall West as a Liberal in 1858, a seat he held until 1885 when the constituency was replaced under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In his original election address, according to The Times, he promised to vote for.:The Times, Saturday, 3 July 1858; pg. 9; Issue 23036; col D *abolition of Church Rates *for the fullest extent of education *strict economy of the public service *admission of Jews to Parliament *abolition of the property qualification *for the ballot, in the event of any constituency needing the protection of it Whilst representing West Cornwall, he was always elected unopposed. At the 1885 general election, St Aubyn was elected as MP for St Ives in a contest that was fiercely contested. \\"The fight was severe\\", according to The Times. He disagreed with William Ewart Gladstone over Irish Home Rule and sat as a Liberal Unionist from 1886 to 1887. In the latter year St Aubyn was raised to the peerage as Baron St Levan, of St Michael's Mount in the County of Cornwall.

(These were not limited overs matches.) The following year, with the Second World War having finished in the European theatre in early May, five so-called \\"Victory Tests\\" were arranged, against an Australian Services XI which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett. England also played a Dominions team at Lord's. Test cricket resumed in England after the Second World War with the visit of India in 1946. England won the series 1 ‚Äì 0 with a 10 wicket victory in the first Test at Lords in which Hardstaff scored 205* and Alec Bedser took 11 wickets on debut. Bedser took another 11 in the next test at Old Trafford. This proved to be a false dawn as England, under the aging Wally Hammond, were roundly beaten 3 ‚Äì 0 on the 1946‚Äì1947 Ashes tour as Lindwall and Miller came to the fore. A deluge left England beaten on an unplayable Gabba pitch after Australia had scored 645. England claimed that Bradman had been caught by Ikin off Voce for 28 but the umpire did not agree and 'The Don' made 187. Hammond batted masterfully for his 32 but Miller took 7 for 60 and then Toshack 6 for 82. Australia won by an innings at Sydney with Bradman and Barnes both scoring 234. England drew at Melbourne, having been set 551 to win and again at Adelaide with Compton scoring a century in each innings, as did Morris for Australia. Australia took the final test at Sydney despite Hutton's 122 and Doug Wright's 7 for 105. England's fortunes recovered with the visit of the South Africans in 1947, a 3 ‚Äì 0 series win restoring spirits in a high scoring rubber. Ken Cranston took four wickets in an over to complete England's victory at Headingley but the series was dominated by the batting of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich who put on 370 together at the Oval and 228 at Old Trafford. Compton scored an incredible 1,187 runs in the five tests and Edrich 869. Alan Melville scored 3 tons for South Africa and Bruce Mitchell two in the Oval test. Set 451 to win by Norman Yarley, the visitors secured the draw, and almost won, with a valiant 423 for 7. The 1947‚Äì1948 tour of the West Indies was a humiliation however with an injury plagued England team beaten 2 ‚Äì 0. Ken Cranston captained England, in the absence of the injured Gubby Allen and George Headley became the first black man to captain the West Indies. England had left Compton, Edrich, Bedser, Wright, Yardley at home and Hutton only joined them in time for the 7th match of the tour. Andy Ganteaume scored 117 in his only test innings at Port of Spain. Worse was to come as Bradman's 'Invincibles' swept all before them in 1948, dismissing England 4 ‚Äì 0 and winning 25, and losing none, of their 34 tour games. England did not help themselves by dropping Len Hutton for the 3rd test. Denis Compton made a stirring 184 at Trent Bridge, withstanding the high pace of Lindwall and Miller in dreadful light. He also scored a brave 145* at Old Trafford having been hit on the forehead by a bouncer and forced to retire hurt. Sid Barnes was also hurt at short leg and taken to hospital. England were bowled out for 52 at the Oval, with the restored Hutton making 32, before Hollies famously bowled Bradman second ball in his final test innings. George Mann captained England in his first series, just as his father had done, when England beat South Africa 2 ‚Äì 0 in 1948‚Äì1949. England won an exciting opening contest at Durban by two wickets, thanks to Cliff Gladwin's famous scurried leg bye. Denis Compton took his only five wicket haul in tests at Cape Town while Hutton and Washbrook posted a record opening stand of 359 at Johannesburg. The consistent Jack Crapp hit 49 to win the last test just before the scheduled close. New Zealand forced a draw in every test of the 1949 series in England with Martin Donnelly, who also played rugby for England, scoring 206 in the Lords Test and Bert Sutcliffe posting a ton at the Oval. 1950s The West Indian tourists of 1950 shocked England with a 3 ‚Äì 1 series victory. The powerful side, built around the batting of the 3 W's, who scored 20 centuries and 6,000 runs between them on tour, and spin twins Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine, showed the old order of Australian and English dominance was over. Frank Worrell scored 261 at Trent Bridge and 138 at the Oval, Walcott hit 168* at Lords and Everton Weekes made a ton at Trent Bridge. 'Ram' took 26 wickets in the tests, and 135 on tour, with his right arm mystery bowling and 11 in the historic win at Lords while Valentine's slow left arm accounted for 33 in the tests, and 123 on tour, including 8 for 104 on debut at Old Trafford. England received another thrashing at the hands of Australia on the 1950/51 tour. Hutton scored a masterful 62* in vain on a Brisbane 'sticky' ‚Äì England declared at 67 ‚Äì 7 and reduced Australia to 32 ‚Äì 7 at one point in return ‚Äì while Denis Compton had a dreadful time, averaging 7.57 in four matches. Australia won by just 28 runs at Melbourne and mystery spinner Jack Iverson took 6 for 27 at Sydney where Australia won by an innings. Len Hutton carried his bat for 156 in a losing cause in Adelaide and England's consolation victory came at Melbourne thanks to Reg Simpson's 156*. Bedser took 30 wickets and Hutton averaged 88.83 but Australia retained the Ashes 4 ‚Äì 1. England beat New Zealand 1 ‚Äì 0 in the two test series played on the way home. In a charming display of sportsmanship, Walter Hadlee recalled Cyril Washbrook after he was given out LBW as he had hit the ball. England beat the 1951 South Africans 3 -1 in a series notable for Len Hutton's dismissal 'obstructing the field' in his 100th test innings at the Oval. Eric Rowan scored 236, at the age of 42, for South Africa at Headingley. England were beaten by India for the first time in a test match at Madras on the 1951/52 tour where Roy and Umrigar scored hundreds and Vinoo Mankad took 12 for 108. England drew the five test series 1 -1. After David Sheppard captained the first two tests in his absence through injury, Len Hutton became the first professional captain of England in 1952, leading his team to a 3 ‚Äì 0 thrashing of India, whose batsman were decidedly less confident against the pace of the debutant Fred Trueman than they had been at home. Trueman took 7 wickets at Headingley, reducing India to 0 ‚Äì 4 at the start of their second innings and followed it up with 8 for 31 at Old Trafford. Hutton scored 150 at Lords where Godfrey Evans hit 98 before lunch. England won back the Ashes 1 ‚Äì 0 in 1953, amid scenes of great jubilation at the Oval, where Fred Trueman played his only match in the series. Willie Watson had blocked out Australia at Lords, and Trevor Bailey everywhere else, and the pair came together in one of the great rearguard actions in England cricket scoring 109 and 71 respectively. Denis Compton's pull saw England home after Laker (4‚Äì75) and Lock (5‚Äì45) had bowled Australia out for 162 in their second innings. The side which England fielded in that match ‚Äì Bailey, May, Graveney, Laker, Lock, Trueman, Edrich, Bedser, Hutton, Compton and Evans with Wardle as 12th man ranks with any England have ever put on the field of play. Tony Lock was called for throwing, not without reason, against Barbados on England's 1953/54 tour, which ended honours even at 2 all. The 17-year-old Garry Sobers was facing at the time. More trouble followed as England lost the first two tests and there was more controversy at Georgetown when the crowd rioted after England took a wicket. Hutton, who scored 169 in the game, refused to take his team off the field and England went on to win by 9 wickets. West Indies amassed 681 at Port of Spain, with the three Ws rampant, but England secured a draw and won at Kingston thanks to Hutton's epic 205 and Bailey's 7 for 34. Denis Compton went on the rampage against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 1954, making 278 before falling to 16-year-old Khalid Hasan. Nineteen-year-old, 5 foot 3 and a half inch, Hanif Mohammed, scored 1600 runs on the tour. Fazal Mahmood bowled Pakistan to a stunning 24 win at the Oval, with 6 wickets in each innings. Bedser and Bailey had been unwisely rested by England and the series was drawn 1 ‚Äì 1. The Ashes tour of 1954‚Äì1955 remains one of the most famous. Things looked bleak when Australia piled up 601 ‚Äì 8 at Sydney and won by an innings with Frank Tyson taking 1 for 160 (and Fred Trueman left at home). England won a narrow victory in the second test at Sydney with Johnny Wardle swishing a vital 35 to top score in England's first innings. May and Cowdrey added 116 in the second dig to set Australia 223 and Tyson (6 for 85) and Brian Statham (3 for 45 into the breeze) bowled them out for 184. Hutton's faith in fast bowling was repaid as England went on to win the series 3 ‚Äì 1. England bowled New Zealand out for just 26 at Auckland in March 1955 and won by an innings. Tyson took 2 for 10, Statham 3 for 9, Bob Appleyard 4 for 7 and Wardle 1 for 0. Len Hutton scored 53 at number 5 in what turned out to be his last test. The score stood at 2 all in the 1955 series against South Africa before England won the fifth test by 92 runs, thanks to Peter May's 85* and Laker and Lock taking 15 wickets between them. Heine took 21 wickets in 4 tests for the tourists. England defeated Australia 2 -1 under new captain Peter May in 1956. The series is forever remembered for Laker's 9 for 37 and 10 for 53 at Old Trafford, where the innings victory secured the series for his team. He took 46 wickets in the series at just 9.61. A tight 2 all series followed on the 1956/57 tour of South Africa. Johnny Wardle, bowling wrist spin as well as orthodox slow left arm, took 12 for 89 to win the Cape Town game where South Africa were dismissed for 72. Russell Endean became the first batsman out 'handled the ball' in Test cricket when he pushed a Jim Laker delivery away from his stumps after padding it away. Captain Peter May scored 1270 runs on the tour ‚Äì and just 152 in the tests in which Hugh Tayfield took 37 wickets. Peter Richardson scored the slowest test century in 488 minutes in the first match at Johannesburg. England continued their excellent run with a crushing 3 ‚Äì 0 win over the 1957 West Indians, each victory coming in three days. May (285*) and Cowdrey (154) put on a famous 411 at Edgbaston after Ramadhin had taken 7 for 49 in England's first innings. Peter Loader took England's first home hat trick since 1899 at Headingley. Tom Graveney scored 164 at Trent Bridge after being recalled. Tony Lock took 11 for 48 at the Oval where West Indies were spun out for 89 and 86 on an 'underprepared' pitch. The 1958 New Zealanders were dispatched 4 ‚Äì 0 but Australia finally regained the Ashes with a crushing 4 ‚Äì 0 victory on England's ill starred 1958‚Äì1959 Ashes tour. The team had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but Richie Benaud's revitalised Australians were too strong. Laker took 15 wickets at 21.2 but Trueman managed 9 in his three appearances and Tony Lock a mere 5 at 75 while the Australians 'bowlers' Meckiff, Rorke, Slater and Burke escaped penalty, if not scrutiny, for their questionable actions. Lindwall, 'last of the straight arm bowlers' passed Grimmet's 216 wickets in his 57th test. A 1 ‚Äì 0 in New Zealand was scant consolation. England thrashed India once again at home in 1959, winning all five tests but were tested against the talented West Indies on the 1959‚Äì1960 tour. Sobers made 226 and Frank Worrell 197* at Bridgetown in the first test, the pair batting together for nine and a half hours in all. The second test, at Trinidad, was won by England after rioting in the wake of Charran Singh's run out. Cowdrey made 114 and 97 in Jamaica but the fast bowling of Wes Hall was fearsome in its intensity. Cowdrey took over the captaincy for the last two tests with May forced home with an abscess. 1960s This decade was a difficult one for English cricket. The distinction between amateurs and gentlemen was abandoned in 1963 when the introduction of one day cricket in the County Game helped boost first class cricket but in the Test arena, despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes for the entire decade. The controversy over throwing, which had simmered on the Ashes tour, boiled over on South Africa's tour of England in 1960, which also saw small anti apartheid demonstrations. Griffen took South Africa's first test hat trick at Lord's but was later called for throwing by umpire Frank Lee. He was called again in an exhibition match which followed the early finish of the test, and then again for not informing the umpire when he changed to bowling underarm. It was the end of his test career and he didn't play again on the tour. England won the series 3 ‚Äì 0 and stretched their undefeated run to 16 games at the Oval when Cowdrey and Pullar put on 290 for the first wicket in the second innings to secure the draw. Ted Dexter (180) and Raman Subba Row (112 on debut) saved England at Edgbaston against the 1961 Australians while Garth McKenzie made his test debut at Lord's and took 5 for 37 in the second innings. The emergence of the Lord's 'ridge' meant that Australia struggled against the pace of Fred Trueman to make the 69 they needed to win after Bill Lawry's first innings century had given them the advantage. Fred Trueman took 11 wickets at Headingley, including a spell of 5 for 0 bowling cutters, squaring the series for England, but Bill Lawry, who scored over 2,000 runs on his first tour of England, ground out another ton at Old Trafford and Benaud's 6 for 70 took the series 2 ‚Äì 1. Benaud famously bowled Peter May around his legs for a duck. England lost 2 ‚Äì 0 against India on the 1961/62 tour of the sub continent but beat Pakistan 1 ‚Äì 0, with the newly pugnacious Bob Barber (86) and Geoff Pullar (165) posting 198 for the first wicket at Dacca. Peter Parfitt scored 3 hundreds in four tests against the Pakistan tourists in 1962 as England thrashed the tourists in each test with Cowdrey, Dexter and Graveney all scoring heavily and the fast bowlers in command. The 1962‚Äì1963 Ashes tour was something of a disappointment both in terms of entertainment and result, although Colin Cowdrey passed Frank Woolley's 305* in scoring 307 against South Australia at Adelaide. Captain Ted Dexter's 99 helped England secure a draw in the first Test at Adelaide where Brian Statham overhauled Alec Bedser's test wicket taking record of 236. England won the second at Melbourne with David Shepherd scoring 113. John Murray, nursing a shoulder injury batted 100 minutes for 3 not out and Fred Titmus took 7 for 79 in the Sydney match but Australia won by 8 wickets. Don Bradman came out of retirement, at the age of 54, for the Prime Minister's XI against M.C.C. at Canberra but was bowled by Statham for just 4. Australia drew the last test at Sydney, despite Ken Barrington's 101 and 94, and retained the Ashes 1 -1. England dismissed New Zealand 3‚Äì0 on the second leg of the tour, with Alan Smith and Colin Cowdrey putting on a world record stand for the 9th wicket in Wellington. Frank Worrell's West Indies hammered England 3 ‚Äì 1 in 1963. An innings defeat at Old Trafford was followed by the dramatic match at Lord's when Colin Cowdrey, his arm broken by Wes Hall, returned to the non strikers end as David Allen faced the last two balls of the game with 6 needed to win. Brian Close, with a charging 70 had taken England to the brink of victory after Dexter's dashing 70 in the first innings against the fearsome pace of Hall and Charlie Griffith with Fred Trueman taking 11 for 152. Trueman took 12 for 119 at Edgbaston to give England their only win of the series but Sober's 102 at Headingley and the bowling of Gibbs and Griffith was too much for England, who also failed to defend 253 at the Oval. England's tour of India in 1963‚Äì1964 saw 5 high scoring draws. R.G. Nadkarni bowled 131 balls without conceding a run in the Test at Madras, and headed the batting averages with 98. India scored 7 centuries to England's 4 but Fred Titmus took 27 wickets. The 1964 Australians retained the Ashes once again with a 1‚Äì0 win. Wally Grout sportingly refused to run out Fred Titmus after he was accidentally knocked over by bowler Neil Hawke and left stranded at Trent Bridge, where Geoff Boycott made his debut. Rain spoiled the game, as it did at Lord's where John Edrich scored 120 in his first Ashes innings. Australia took the test, and the series, at Headingley where Burge belted 160 and Fred Titmus took 6 for 94 off 77 overs. Dexter took him off with Australian 187 for 7 and the Australians doubled their score against the new ball, going on to win by 7 wickets. Bob Simpson and Bill Lawry put on 201 for the first wicket and Simpson went on to post 311. Simpson escaped a 'close' run out decision early on. England saved the game with 256 from Ken Barrington, his 10th test century but his first at home. Most famously Fred Trueman took his 300th wicket in his 65th test, Hawke was the first to congratulate him after being caught by Colin Cowdrey. England played well in their next two series, defeating South Africa 1 -0 on the 1964‚Äì1965 tour, the last they made before South Africa's isolation. England won at Durban, thanks to centuries from Barrington and Parks, and drew the other four. John Edrich scored 310* at Headingley against New Zealand in 1965, hitting a record 57 boundaries. Edrich put on 369 with Ken Barrington (163) who had been dropped after the Edgbaston test for taking 437 minutes to score 137. He failed to score in twenty overs at one point. John Snow made his debut for England who won the series 3 ‚Äì 0. It was the first summer of 'twin tours' and South Africa proved sterner opposition, winning at Trent Bridge by 94 runs. The superb Graeme Pollock scored 125 off 145 balls and brother Peter Pollock took 10 for 87. England were frustrated by the weather at the Oval, where they made a desperate attempt to square the series. Colin Bland, a fine batsman as well as brilliant fielder, made a century and England finished on 308 for 4. It was only the second series win for South Africa in what was the last Test played between the two countries until the end of apartheid. There were 7 totals over 400 in the 1965/66 Ashes, four by Australia for whom Bill Lawry was a fixture. Bob Barber made a brilliant 185 at Sydney, putting on 234 with Geoff Boycott. John Edrich scored 2 hundreds for England in the series while Bob Cowper scored 307* in 727 minutes for Australia in the final test at Melbourne. Doug Walters scored 155 and 115 in his first two matches. The 1 -1 Ashes draw was followed by 3 more drawn tests in New Zealand. The genius of Garry Sobers was in full bloom on the West Indies 1966 tour of England. He scored 161, 163*, 94 and 174 to set up 3 test wins and save the Lord's test against all the odds when he put on 274 with cousin David Holford after the West Indies had been reduced to 90 ‚Äì 5. Colin Milburn scored a thrilling 94 on debut then 126 at Lords but his career was tragically curtailed by a car accident in which he lost an eye. Ken Barrington was given a thorough working over by Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith and was left out after two matches when the strain got too much. Derek Underwood was hit in the teeth by Charlie Griffith when the West Indies needed just one wicket to win. Basil Butcher scored 209 at Trent Bridge. Cowdrey was replaced by the battling Brian Close as captain at the Oval and the indefatigable Yorkshireman led his team from the front to an innings victory. Graveney (165), Ken Higgs (63) and John Snow (59*) put on 361 for England's last three wickets in their first innings. India lost all three tests in the first half of 1967 when Geoff Boycott was famously dropped for scoring too slowly in his 246* at Headingley. Pakistan were beaten 2 ‚Äì 0, with Ken Barrington scoring a hundred in each of the three tests. Although England won the match, Pakistan played brilliantly at the Oval where Asif Iqbal made a dazzling 146. England eked out a rare series victory against the West Indies on the 1967‚Äì1968 tour, thanks to Garry Sobers' inviting declaration. Ken Barrington made 143 in the opening test at Port of Spain, his fourth in four tests, as did John Edrich, while rioting disrupted the Sabina Park match after Basil Butcher was given run out. Cowdrey was back as England captain after Brian Close had characteristically refused to apologise after a time wasting incident in a county match at Edgbaston. Fred Titmus lost 4 toes in a boating accident before the 3rd test. The 1968 Ashes series was once again a 1 -1 draw, with much attention paid to Australian mystery spinner Johnny Gleeson. Lawry's Australians won the first test at Old Trafford but were rolled for 78 at Lord's where Milburn scored a rollicking 83. Wintry conditions ‚Äì the ground was white with hail on the first day ‚Äì allowed the Australians to escape. Cowdrey scored a hundred when he became the first test player to play 100 matches. England won the Oval test after volunteers from the crowd helped clear the puddles after a storm, and Australia, 85 for 5 when the rain came at lunch, were bowled out by Derek Underwood who took 7 for 50. Having scored 158 in the Oval Test, Basil D'Oliveira was controversially left out of the tour party to South Africa. Tom Cartwright withdrew with injury and South African Prime Minister John Vorster objected to D'Oliveira replacing him. M.C.C. cancelled the tour and journeyed instead to Pakistan, where trouble was never far away. Draws at Lahore and Dacca were followed by riots in Karachi where Milburn, Graveney and Knott all scored centuries. The test, and the tour, were abandoned. England ended the decade on a high, defeating both the fading West Indies and New Zealand 2 ‚Äì 0 at home in 1969. John Hampshire scored a debut century at Lords against the West Indies but it proved a false dawn in his test career. Ray Illingworth became a surprise, but wise, choice as England captain after Colin Cowdrey suffered an achilles injury. Glenn Turner, in his original incarnation as a blocker, carried his bat for 43 in New Zealand's 131 at Lord's. 1970s The cancellation of the proposed South Africa tour in 1970 led to the arrangement of a 5 test series against a powerful 'The Rest of the World' team. The matches were awarded Test status at the time but this was controversially revoked. Spearheaded by fast bowler John Snow, England regained the Ashes with two victories in Sydney under the canny captaincy of Ray Illingworth in a seven test series. A 1 ‚Äì 0 series victory at home against Pakistan was followed by a surprise defeat against India but, after a rare winter off, the Ashes were again retained at home 2 ‚Äì 2 in 1972. England toured India under Tony Lewis in 1972‚Äì73 and lost the series 2 -1, with the Indian spin bowlers at their peak, before grinding out 3 draws in Pakistan. After defeating New Zealand 2 ‚Äì 0 in the first test series of the summer a powerful West Indies side, featuring Garry Sobers on his last tour, defeated England 2 ‚Äì 0. England claimed an honourable 1 ‚Äì 1 draw in the tour of the West Indies which followed in 1973‚Äì74 and beat India in all three tests at home in 1974 before drawing three tests against a flamboyant Pakistan team in the latter half of the summer. The Ashes were lost in a calamitous tour in 1974‚Äì75 under Mike Denness as England, without the self exiled Geoff Boycott, were destroyed 4 ‚Äì 1 by the pace of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. England reached the semi final of the first World Cup in 1975 before losing to Australia and lost the following four test Ashes series 1 ‚Äì 0. Another winter without a tour was followed by a heavy defeat under Tony Greig against a rampant West Indies. Clive Lloyd's men began their 15-year dominance of world cricket thanks to a battering pace attack led by Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Wayne Daniel and the magnificent batting of Viv Richards stirred by Greig's unfortunate 'grovel' gaffe. England recovered to post a famous 3 ‚Äì 1 win over India, thanks to their own fast bowlers, in 1976‚Äì77 and fought bravely in the Centenary Test of 1977, thanks to Derek Randall's superb 174, before losing by 45 runs, the same result as the first Test played one hundred years before. The breaking news of the Packer schism of World Series Cricket led to Grieg's removal as captain and the appointment of Mike Brearley as captain for the 1977 Ashes. A divided Australian team were defeated 3 ‚Äì 1 in a series famous for Geoff Boycott's return and 100th century at Headingley and Ian Botham's debut. Draws against New Zealand and Pakistan on tour in 1977‚Äì78 were followed by the destruction of New Zealand and a Pakistan team shorn of its Packer stars in 1978. With David Gower making his debut, Ian Botham and Bob Willis at their peak with the ball and Geoff Boycott and Graham Gooch opening the batting England were a formidable outfit. A 5 ‚Äì 1 victory against a weak Australian team in 1978‚Äì79, thanks to the determined batting of Derek Randall and a strong bowling side, was followed by a 1 ‚Äì 0 victory at home over India and a World Cup final appearance against the West Indies. Viv Richards and Collis King thumped the English attack around Lord's before Joel Garner blew the England middle order away. With the Packer rift healed England agreed to a three test series in Australia, which they lost, but retained the Ashes as they had only agreed to the tour if they were not for stake. 1980s Ian Botham took over the captaincy but was unfortunate to face the mighty West Indian side of the time in his first ten matches in charge. A fighting performance at home in 1980, in which they managed to draw 4 of the 5 tests and almost won at Trent Bridge, was followed by a crushing 'blackwash' in the West Indies in 1980/81 and, after a pair at Lord's in the first Test against Australia, in 1981, Botham lost the captaincy. Mike Brearley took over once again and a revitalised Botham tore through the Australians with bat and ball to bring exciting victories at Headingley, Edgbaston and Old Trafford. At Headingley, England won by 18 runs after following-on, only the second time in the history of England v Australia Tests that this has been achieved. Keith Fletcher took over and lost a desperately dull series in India 1 ‚Äì 0 in 1981/82, thanks to turgid pitches and dreadful over rates from both teams, but thanks largely to Ian Botham won a one off test in Sri Lanka on the way home. Bob Willis was appointed captain for the 1 ‚Äì 0 victory over India and the 2 ‚Äì 1 win over Pakistan in 1982 but the Ashes were lost 2 -1 on the 1982/3 tour, despite a thrilling 3 run win in Melbourne. The 1983 World Cup was held in England, for the third time. They lost in the semi-finals to India, who then won the final. England defeated New Zealand 3 ‚Äì 1 in the tests which followed but struggled on the 1983/4 tour to New Zealand and Pakistan, losing both rubbers 1 ‚Äì 0. The West Indian, at its absolute peak, destroyed England 5 ‚Äì 0 in 1984, to no-one's great surprise, and Sri Lanka drew their lone test at the end of the summer. David Gower led England to an excellent 2 ‚Äì 1 victory in India on the 1984/5 tour and the Australians were crushed by a powerful England batting display at home in England in 1985 with Gower, Tim Robinson and Richard Ellison among the stars. Hopes that this improvement could see a challenge mounted on the 1985/6 tour of the West Indies were dashed as England were pummelled to defeat by fearsome fast bowling. A shellshocked England went down to India 2 ‚Äì 0 at home before beating New Zealand 1 ‚Äì 0 but there were few hopes that the Ashes could be retained on the 1986‚Äì87 tour. Famously described by the journalist Martin Johnson as the team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field' Mike Gatting's men regrouped and swept all before them and dominated the series, winning 2 ‚Äì 1. A strong Pakistan team, boasting the talents of Javed Miandad, Abdul Qadir and Imran Khan beat England 1 ‚Äì 0 home and away in 1987 and 1987/88 and a draw in the 'return' Centenary Test in Australia was followed by a 0 ‚Äì 0 draw in three tests against a New Zealand side spearheaded by Martin Crowe and Richard Hadlee. The first World Cup to be held abroad (and also the first to be contested with 50 over games, not 60) in 1987 saw England lose to Australia by 7 runs, in a hugely exciting final. England were battered by the West Indies once again at home in 1988, although the blackwash was averted in a 4 ‚Äì 0 defeat. A succession of England batsman were injured at the crease and a victory against Sri Lanka at the end of the summer did little to heal the bruising England had received. Unusually there was no tour that winter, with political troubles raising their ugly head and the proposed Indian trip being cancelled, but England's respite was short lived as Allan Border's Australians heralded the dawn of a new age of antipodean dominance as they trounced England 4 ‚Äì 0 in 1989. The Ashes were not to be regained for another long 16 years. A South African rebel tour was announced even before the series ended with Graham Gooch and others being banned for their part for three years. A new look team of 'young lions' fared better than in previous tours in a 2‚Äì1 defeat in the West Indies in 1989/90. 1990s The Media Centre at Lord's Cricket Ground English cricket went on a slide during the 1990s. This was not helped by squabbles between key players and the chairman of selectors, Raymond Illingworth. They were more often than not beaten badly during the Ashes series, as they were spellbound by Shane Warne and later Glenn McGrath. They were declared the unofficial worst side in the world after the 1999 home series loss to New Zealand. Under their new captain Graham Gooch at the beginning of the decade, England missed out on a historic victory against the all-conquering West Indian cricket team, by losing their final two test matches having gone into them with a 1‚Äì0 lead. The elevation to the position of captain for Gooch led to him reaching new heights as a batsman during the summer of 1990. The new captain broke the record for most runs in a match against India at Lord's with scores of 333 and 123. New team members such as Michael Atherton, Alec Stewart and Angus Fraser aided the new captain to victories against India and New Zealand yet the team were unable to regain the Ashes during the following winter, losing 3‚Äì0. The team returned during 1991 to more successful ways, by defeating Sri Lanka and New Zealand and holding the West Indies to a drawn series. Another excellent innings from Gooch against the likes of Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh at Headingley helped the side to their first victory against the team in England for over two decades. Although England were not the best Test match side in the world, they could lay claim to holding that position in the one-day game. The 1992 Cricket World Cup saw England performing better than everyone else, with victories over Australia, the West Indies and South Africa led them to the final against Pakistan, where a side led and inspired by Imran Khan defeated Gooch's side. Around this time, players such as Ian Botham, Allan Lamb and David Gower all came to the end of their international careers and specifically in the case of Botham, England had trouble replacing these players. Batsmen like Graeme Hick, Mark Ramprakash, Chris Lewis and Phil Tufnell all promised and sometimes delivered a great deal, yet the side often performed badly and disappointed its fans. Following their victory in New Zealand before the Cricket World Cup, they did not win again for another two and a half years, when the side again defeated the same opponents. During this period defeats by Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Australia culminated in Gooch stepping down in the summer of 1993 as captain, to be replaced by his partner at the top of the order, Michael Atherton. The period of captaincy under Atherton was seen as one of disaster followed by more and more disappointment for England's fans. Selectoral differences between Atherton and Raymond Illingworth often meant that players such as Angus Fraser and Devon Malcolm would not get picked, against the captain's wishes. Teams would sometimes have too many batsmen, no spin bowler and the plethora of players who would come into the side and then quickly disappear, was symptomatic of a troubled side. The demands of county cricket often meant that injuries would deny Atherton key players and when compared with Australian cricket, it was seen as antiquated by many. Performances of great excellence would often crop up, amid the rubbish. These included two centuries in a test match at Port of Spain by Alec Stewart, nine wickets in an innings from Devon Malcolm against South Africa, seven wickets on debut by Dominic Cork against the West Indies and Michael Atherton and Jack Russell batting for ten hours to salvage a draw in Johannesburg. By 1997, calls for Atherton to step down were only put off by an exciting victory at The Oval against Australia, despite losing the series 3‚Äì2. On the following tour to the West Indies, a 3‚Äì1 defeat forced the beleaguered captain to step down, to be replaced by wicketkeeper-batsman Alec Stewart. Stewart's first test series against South Africa in the summer of 1998 resulted in the side's first success in a five match test series since their last victory against Australia in 1986/1987. Bowlers such as Dominic Cork, Angus Fraser and Darren Gough now led the bowling attack with Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash supporting Stewart and Atherton in the batting. Yet the deficiencies in the system remained and a 3‚Äì1 defeat on their next Ashes tour and a humiliating exit in the first round of the 1999 Cricket World Cup which was hosted by England led to the exit of Stewart. His replacement as captain, Essex batsman Nasser Hussain, was the unfortunate holder of the captaincy during the 1999 Test series against New Zealand when a 2‚Äì1 defeat resulted in the country which gave birth to the game, being officially ranked as the worst Test-playing nation in the world. 2000s Hussain's side was unable to avoid defeat in South Africa, yet his first series victory, against Zimbabwe the following summer, saw the side winning their next three test series. This included the side's first victory against the West Indies in 32 years, impressive wins in Pakistan, where Thorpe and Hussain helped see the side to victory in the dark in Karachi and a 2‚Äì1 defeat of Sri Lanka, where England displayed a new-found confidence of playing against spin bowling, a move instigated by their new coach Duncan Fletcher. However, the ultimate test for the side against Australia showed that England were still found wanting against the very best, losing 4‚Äì1. Injuries and retirements from the side over the next year allowed new players to come into the side. Out went Atherton, Hick, Ramprakash, Gough, Cork, Tufnell and Andrew Caddick and in came Marcus Trescothick, Michael Vaughan, Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Stephen Harmison and Ashley Giles. Hussain looked to create a side which was harder to beat and would often rule with an uncompromising attitude. Changes which the game had long needed were made, with central contracts limiting how much county cricket the players could play and the establishment of an academy. Encouraging performances by players like Vaughan, Trescothick and Hoggard against India and Sri Lanka did give England some positive sentiments towards their chances against Australia, yet a 4‚Äì1 defeat against possibly the greatest team ever showed that they were still falling short. This and England's withdrawal from a 2003 Cricket World Cup match in Zimbabwe led to Hussain becoming disillusioned with the job. After the first Test of the 5 Test series against South Africa was drawn, Nasser Hussain resigned the Test captaincy, with Michael Vaughan being appointed in his stead. Vaughan went on to draw the series 2‚Äì2, after an Oval Test match rated by most commentators as the greatest in England since the 1981 Headingley Test. By the time of the tour in early 2004 to the West Indies, Vaughan had settled into his position as captain and was seen as an inspirational leader, who was respected by his players. This newly found confidence in the team led the side to a 3‚Äì0 victory in the Caribbean, followed by whitewashes over New Zealand and the West Indies at home, with players such as Harmison and Flintoff becoming amongst the very best in the world. On 21 December 2004 England completed their eighth successive Test victory with a win in the opening Test against South Africa at Port Elizabeth, the best sequence of Test match wins by England and the team were able to complete their first away victory over their opponents since they were re- admitted to the game in 1991. Coming into the 2005 Ashes series, England had moved up to second, having won 14 and drawn 3 of their 18 previous Test matches since March 2004, raising hopes that the series would be closely fought. The Ashes series had a long build up, with England and Australia playing a triangular ODI series with Bangladesh, with the final England- Australia match ending in a tie (not a draw), prior to a second one-day series between England and Australia won 2‚Äì1 by Australia. Australia won the first Test at Lord's comfortably, but England came back to win the second Test at Edgbaston with a two run victory, the narrowest win by runs in Ashes history. The third Test ended in a draw, with one day having been lost to rain and England one wicket away from victory. England then narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after forcing the Australians to follow on. In the fifth and final Test at the Oval in London England came into the final day needing to avoid a defeat with a lead of 40 runs and one wicket down, and batted until well after the tea interval to ensure the game would end a draw and England would regain the Ashes 2‚Äì1. In the first Test series (versus Pakistan) after The Ashes triumph (in November/December 2005) England came down to earth with a bump. In the first Test match in Multan England squandered a strong position (first innings lead of 144) to eventually lose the match by 22 runs. The second Test at Faisalabad was drawn with Pakistan pressing hard for victory. In the final Test at Lahore England collapsed again to lose by an innings and 100 runs (their first innings defeat for two years). A test series against India followed in March 2006 with Andrew Flintoff as captain. After the first Test match was drawn due to bad light on the final day, India came back strongly to win the 2nd test but England showed true character to come back and win the third (their first Test Match win in India for 21 years) without five key players, including skipper Michael Vaughan and vice-captain Marcus Trescothick to level the three-game series. Although Trescothick returned for the three Test series against Sri Lanka in England, Flintoff retained the captaincy in the absence of Vaughan. England went on to draw the first test match despite taking a commanding lead after the first innings, England won the second test match but lost the third to tie the series 1‚Äì1. With Flintoff now also absent through injury, England had yet another new captain in Andrew Strauss for the subsequent one-day series with Sri Lanka. After narrowly losing the one-off Twenty20 international, England then lost all five of the One-day Internationals, not helped by wayward bowling and further injuries. Strauss remained captain for the start of the Test series with Pakistan which followed. After the first match was drawn, Strauss was given the captaincy for the rest of the series when Flintoff was ruled out for the rest of the season, and under Strauss the side went on to win back-to-back tests at Old Trafford and Headingley and take an unassailable lead in the four-match series. The final test at The Oval ended in farce when umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove awarded five runs to England after ruling that Pakistan had tampered with the ball. Pakistan refused to leave the pavilion after tea and the umpires removed the bails, signifying that Pakistan had forfeited the match. Pakistan later took to the field, only for the umpires to stay in the pavilion. After a night of heated discussions, it was eventually agreed that the test had been correctly awarded to England, handing them a 3‚Äì0 series win. Flintoff was awarded the captaincy for the 2006‚Äì07 Ashes tour but shambolic England performances saw the team collapse to a 5 ‚Äì 0 whitewash, with a late fightback to ultimately win the following Commonwealth Bank one-day series proving scant consolation. Michael Vaughan returned from injury to lead a sorry World Cup campaign with England losing to New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Africa and crashing out in the Super 8s, despite a thrilling victory over the West Indies, thanks to Kevin Pietersen's century, in Brian Lara's last international appearance.

He was a member of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) for thirty years. He was recognised as an authority on MƒÅori customs and language. His views on MƒÅori rights, expressed in several books strongly criticised the actions of the New Zealand Government. Hadfield married Catherine (Kate) Williams (24 February 1831 ‚Äì 8 January 1902) a daughter of the Rev. Henry Williams and Marianne Williams. Background He was born into an affluent family but often had very poor health and nearly died on several occasions. He received an excellent university education but did not finish his degree due to ill health. As a member of a wealthy family he was able to tour though Europe. Normally, lack of a degree would have prevented him being ordained but he was able to secure a position in New Zealand. Church ministry He joined the CMS in October 1837. Hadfield was admitted to deacon's orders in September 1838 in Sydney by Bishop Broughton, bishop of Australia. He was very friendly with Samuel Marsden but did not share his views on high church Anglicanism. The CMS missionaries held the low church beliefs that were common among the 19th century Evangelical members of the Anglican Church. Church Missionary Society In December 1838 Hadfield arrived in the Bay of Islands, in M.S. Pelorus, travelling with Bishop Broughton, who was making a pastoral visit to the native church established by the CMS among the MƒÅori. On 6 January 1839 he became the first priest to be ordained in New Zealand. Hadfield was stationed at Paihia in the Bay of Islands. Following a request by TƒÅmihana Te Rauparaha and MƒÅtene Te Whiwhi for a missionary in their area, Hadfield travelled with Henry Williams to establish an CMS mission on the Kapiti Coast in November 1839. Riwai Te Ahu, who later became an Anglican minister, was baptised by Hadfield at the Waikanae Mission in 1840. Pineaha Te Mahauariki, who also became an Anglican minister, was baptised by Hadfield in 1842. In December 1843 Bishop Selwyn, the first Anglican Bishop of New Zealand, attended Otaki to confirm a young chief and 142 of his followers. Bishop Selwyn appointed him rural dean of the Western District of Wellington and Taranaki in 1844 and as archdeacon of Kapiti in March 1849. Relations with the MƒÅori During his early years he travelled throughout the Wellington region that had been conquered by numerous Taranaki tribes. He became close friends with the NgƒÅti Toa leader Te Rauparaha who had led the invasion of the wider Wellington region during the long running Musket Wars. It was Te Rauparaha's Christian son TƒÅmihana who had invited him to the MƒÅori community to live. Hadfield buried Te Rauparaha in 1849 after his release from imprisonment. Te ƒÄti Awa built the first church within the Waikanae pƒÅ which inspired other churches, including RangiƒÅtea, built by NgƒÅti Raukawa in Otaki during 1848-1851. He became part of the ≈åtaki Ngati Raukawa community where he made every effort to learn MƒÅori language and customs and shared these with governor George Grey. They went to the same church. He lived in the community for 30 years, established 20 mission schools and became well integrated into the MƒÅori community. In 1852 he published a spelling book for MƒÅori children. Later he became increasingly intolerant and dogmatic in his views as he clashed with the government. He lived in an age when the early influence of missionaries had declined.O. Hadfield and the Growth of the Gospel in Central NZ.Bruce Patrick. Aftermath of the Wairau Affray Following the Wairau Affray in 1843, where a confrontation between Te Rauparaha and group of settlers left twenty-two Europeans dead, many settlers believed an attack on then thinly populated Wellington was possible and Hadfield was seen as a peacemaker preventing the spread of hostilities. Hadfield's support of Wiremu Kƒ´ngi's claim to Waitara Hadfield became far less popular when in 1860, Hadfield upheld Wiremu Kƒ´ngi's claim to the Waitara block. The surveying of this land prior to military occupation precipitated the First Taranaki War, and Hadfield became a leading critic of the Government in these actions. He \\"was for some time the most unpopular man in the colony\\". He was described in the press at the time as \\"a traitor and a bigoted meddlesome missionary\\". Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington In 1877 Wiremu Parata took Hadfield and the Church to court over a gift of land which was not used for a school as intended; the far-reaching case Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington was lost when the Treaty of Waitangi was ruled a simple nullity.

As the name suggests, the new district will be built around the city's rail station, Ceannt Station, which will itself undergo a major redevelopment as part of the project.  Site  Currently, Ceannt Station takes up an area of 0.99 ha. However, the site takes up an area of 5.97 ha, and the new 'urban quarter' will take up 3.80 ha (64%) of this land while the station will take up 2.17 ha (36%).  Railway station redevelopment  Ceannt Station will undergo a major redevelopment to make it the most modern transport hub on the island of Ireland. The two railway platforms will be upgraded to three to cope, with the addition of commuter rail services in 2008/09. Bus services also form a major part of this, with 25 bus bays to be positioned next to the rail platforms. A taxi rank will also be located immediately outside the station, and car and bicycle parking will be located near to the station as well. The station will be designed in 'cathedral' style, with a fully glass roof providing natural light as well as heat in the winter months and reducing both in the summer.  Urban Quarter  The Urban Quarter will take up most (64%) of the site and will be built on what is now derelict railway works. The area will be environmentally friendly and partially (if not fully) self-sufficient, using greywater systems and solar panels as well as architecture to provide both heat and light naturally to areas both outside and inside buildings. The area will be built outdoors on various levels to maximise the use of space. The site will be arranged as follows * Cultural Facility: 490 square metres. * Community facility: 870 square metres. * Creche: 1,340 square metres. * Fitness centre 1,390 square metres. * Public Park: 5,800 square metres. * Public Square: 5,870 square metres. * Private communal space: 6,540 square metres. * Public Streets: 8,030 square metres. * Hotel: 15,000 square metres. * Commercial (offices): 19,830 square metres. * Retail: 32,680 square metres. * Residential (573 units): 49,520 square metres. * Car Parking: (1,390 commercial, 500 public): 57,350 square metres. File:ceannt chart3.png In addition, existing buildings, particularly historical ones, will be not demolished but rather redeveloped and made habitable to preserve Galway's existing traditional architecture.

The population in 2011 was 1,061,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 79.83 km¬≤. The small parish developed under the patronage of Order of Aviz, endowments from the Marqu√™s Rat√£o family. History The founding of this settlement is attributed to friar Louren√ßo Afonso, a master in the Order of Aviz, in 1342. Galveias was a priory in the Order of Avis, and benefited from the Order's wealth, and religious patronage. But, economically, the region was already a prosperous agricultural centre, supported by the cultivation of oranges and raising of local poultry (both emblematic of its coat-of-arms). It was originally known as Vila Nova do Laranjal because of its many orange groves. In addition, olive oil and wine (currently marketed under the Marques Rat√£o brand) were produced and commercialized by its citizens. Jorge de Alencastre, son of King John II, first expanded the settlement in 1425. On 1 January 1512, the settlers benefited from a foral (charter) issued by the Aviz, and granted by King Manuel I. By 1538, King John III elevated the settlement to the status of town. Important to the regions growth were the Counts of Galveias: the first titular, Dinis de Melo e Castro, was installed in 1691 (there were 10 titular until it was ultimately extinguished in 1940). Geography Galveias is situated in the municipality of Ponte de Sor: it is located 14 kilometres from the municipal seat, and 18 kilometres from the town of Av√≠s, crossed by the E.N.244 motorway. The local population is concentrated in the main town (Galveias), in which the homes are older dwellings, apart from two modern residential developments. Comprising 1800 residents, it is composed of primarily seniors (having the highest percentage of older adults), in addition to an elevated number of immigrants (primarily from the United Kingdom). Galveias has its own administrative council () and executive (), post of the G.N.R, post office and one banking institution. In addition to the kindergarten (Escola EB/J D. Anita), which receives 3 to 4 year olds until primary, it also has its own primary school (Escola de Galveias) consisting of pre-primary, primary and pre-secondary students, consisting of six classrooms. A seniors residence provides lodging, assistance and hygiene for 70 seniors, supported by a small health centre () providing administration, consultancy and curative care and a small hospital with limited assistance and palliative care. Economy The region supports a micro-climate, adequate to support the orange groves, vineyards and olive orchards that dominate the agricultural industry. Portion of the parish is allocated to two hunting reserves for tourists and local huntsmen. Many of its citizens are involved in seasonal (agricultural) employment, work outside the parish (mainly in Ponte de Sor and Avis) or are employed under the Programas Ocupacionais do Centro de Emprego. The commercial activities are limited, but include caf√©s and various smaller concessionaires.

First as an important trading city in the Hanseatic League, then as the capital of the electorate of Brandenburg and the Prussian Kingdom, later on as one of the biggest cities in Germany it fostered an influential music culture that remains vital until today. Berlin can be regarded as the breeding ground for the powerful choir movement that played such an important role in the broad socialization of music in Germany during the 19th century. History=1700 -1900  When in 1701 Frederick III declared himself Frederick I, \\"King in Prussia\\", Berlin became a royal residence and subsequently attained more musical prestige. Under his successor Frederick William I (1713‚Äì1740), musical life in Berlin lost part of its splendor, due to his focus on the military strengthening of Prussia. At that time the court orchestra was abandoned and music events at the court played only a decorative role. The opera in Berlin around 1745 When in 1740, Frederick II came to power, musical life at the court flourished again. Many 18th-century writers have termed his reign the \\"Golden Age\\" for music making in Berlin. Although statements like this have to be regarded with care for their obvious intention to glorify the person of the ruler, Frederick's reign was indeed a fruitful time for music making in Berlin. Already at Rheinsberg, where Frederick lived when he was still the crown prince, he had assembled a formidable group of musicians who were to form the core of his Kapelle in Berlin. Among these followers were Carl Heinrich and Johann Gottlieb Graun, Franz and Johann Benda, Christoph Schaffrath, and Johann Gottlieb Janitsch. Once installed as the King in Prussia, Frederick's Kapelle became quickly one of the most admired orchestras in Europe. Frederick who was an accomplished flautist and composer employed Europe's foremost flautist, Johann Joachim Quantz in 1741. His Kappelle, headed by C. H. Graun, could also boast of C. P. E. Bach, son of Johann Sebastian Bach, who joined the orchestra as harpsichordist in 1740, and of Johann Friedrich Agricola as the official court composer. By 1750 around 50 musicians were in Frederick's employment. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin playing the piano in Prince Radziwill's Berlin Salon in the Palais Radziwill (Henryk Siemiradzki, 1887). The principal occasions at which music was played at the court included the daily soir√©es in which Frederick used to play the flute, and the concerts in the residence of the King's mother, Sophia Dorothea of Hanover at which Frederick's Kapelle had to perform as well. In addition to these regular events, the Kapelle also had to perform in the opera performances during Lent. Other important venues for music making at the Hohenzollern court were the residences of Prince Henry of Prussia and Margrave Frederick Henry. Frederick, an ardent opera enthusiast, was determined to turn Berlin into an international center for opera, one that could compete with the splendid opera house in Dresden. To this end, Frederick commissioned two opera stages from his architect George Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff. The first in the King's residence, the Berliner Stadtschlo√ü, the second as a completely new opera house, located Unter den Linden, the main artery of Berlin which featured all of the representational buildings of the time. The stage in the Stadtschlo√ü was inaugurated with a performance of Graun's Rodelinda on December 13, 1741. The construction of the new opera house started in 1741 and although not fully completed yet the first performance took place on December 7, 1742 with Graun's Cleopatra e Cesare. In preparation of the two premieres, Frederick sent Graun to Italy and France in order to recruit singers and dancers respectively. The K√∂nigliche Opernhaus, as the new opera house was called, remained the main opera house of Berlin throughout the century and the repertoire given there consisted mainly of Italian opera seria. 1900‚Äì2015 From the end of World War II Berlin was divided. A western sector, controlled by Britain, France, the United States, controlled eventually, in 1949, was within territory under the control of a new West German state, the Federal Republic of Germany. The eastern section, under the control of Soviet Union's occupying force, went under the control of a new east German state, the German Democratic Republic. The city's long-standing concert music institutions were in the two sections. In the West was the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra; in the East was the Konzerthausorchester Berlin or Berlin Symphony Orchestra, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin), as well as the Staatskapelle Berlin, the orchestra associated with the Berlin State Opera, which resided in the eastern sector of Berlin. The SO36 in Kreuzberg originally focused largely on punk music, but today has become a popular venue for many dances and parties. SOUND, located from 1971 to 1988 in Tiergarten and today in Charlottenburg, gained notoriety in the late 1970s for its popularity with heroin users and other drug addicts as described in Christiane F.'s book Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo.Christiane F.-Page, christianef. Retrieved 18 November 2006. With a \\"New Europe\\" emerging at the end of the Cold War, the rock band U2 chose Berlin, in the centre of the reuniting continent, as a source of inspiration for a more European musical aesthetic. They recorded at Hansa Studios in West Berlin, near the recently opened Berlin Wall. Several acclaimed records were made at Hansa, including two from David Bowie's \\"Berlin Trilogy\\" with Eno, and Iggy Pop's The Idiot. U2 arrived on 3 October 1990 on the last flight into East Berlin on the eve of German reunification. Music industries Universal Music Germany Industries that do business in the creative arts and entertainment are an important and sizable sector of the economy of Berlin. The creative arts sector comprises music, film, advertising, architecture, art, design, fashion, performing arts, publishing,Berlin Cracks the Startup Code TV, radio, and video games. Around 22,600 creative enterprises, predominantly SMEs, generated over 18,6 billion Euro in total revenue. Berlin's creative industries have contributed an estimated 20% of Berlin's gross domestic product in 2005. Berlin is home to many international and regional television and radio stations. The public broadcaster RBB has its headquarters in Berlin as well as the commercial broadcasters MTV Europe, VIVA, and N24. German international public broadcaster Deutsche Welle has its TV production unit in Berlin, and most national German broadcasters have a studio in the city. American radio programming from National Public Radio is also broadcast on the FM dial. Personalities Many important musical figures have worked in Berlin, among them composers like Johann Joachim Quantz, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, the Graun brothers, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch, Johann Friedrich Reichardt, Carl Friedrich Zelter, Friedrich Heinrich Himmel, Vincenzo Righini, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Spontini, Meyerbeer, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg to name just a few. Moreover, Berlin was recognized as the center for music theory and criticism in the 18th century with leading figures like Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg, Johann Philipp Kirnberger, Quantz, and C. P. E. Bach whose treatises were being read all over Europe. Later on, writers like Reichardt, E. T. A. Hoffmann, Ludwig Rellstab, and A. B.

Festivals Lollapalooza, Berlin * Berlin Festival * Fete de la Musique * JazzFest Berlin * Lollapalooza BerlinLollapalooza Berlin/Deutschland website Clubs and nightlife Inside the Berghain Berlin's nightlife is one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind in Europe. The music club, Linientreu, near the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, has been in business in the late 1980s and 1990s. Throughout the 1990s, people in their twenties from many countries, made Berlin's club scene the premier nightlife destination in the world. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city center of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and counterculture gatherings. Mitte and surrounding boroughs were home to many nightclubs, including Kunst Haus Tacheles, Cookies, Tresor, WMF, Ufo, E-Werk, KitKatClub and Berghain. Berlin is notable for the length of its parties. Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time on the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or all weekend. Berghain features the Panorama Bar, so named because the bar opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goer's a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night.

Born in Rotorua, Warbrick played club rugby for Auckland side Ponsonby while boarding at St Stephen's Native School. In 1877, he was selected to play fullback for Auckland Provincial Clubs as a 15-year-old, making him the youngest person to play first-class rugby in New Zealand. He played for Auckland against the visiting New South Wales team, the first overseas side to tour the country, in 1882. Two years later, he was selected for the first New Zealand representative team, and playing mainly as a three-quarter, appeared in seven of the side's eight matches on their tour of New South Wales. In 1888, Warbrick conceived of, selected, and led the privately funded New Zealand Native team. The squad, which included four of Warbrick's brothers, was originally envisaged to contain only MƒÅori players, but eventually included several New Zealand-born and foreign-born Europeans. Although the team played 107 matches, including 74 in the British Isles, Warbrick took part in only 21 matches due to injury. The tour, the first from the Southern Hemisphere to visit Britain, remains the longest in rugby's history. In 2008, Warbrick and the Natives were inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame. Warbrick effectively retired from rugby after returning from the tour, with the exception of an appearance for Auckland in 1894, and went on to work as a farmer and tourist guide in the Bay of Plenty. In 1903, he was killed along with several others by an eruption of the Waimangu Geyser.  Background and early career  Joe (left) and his half-brother Billy in the 1870s alt=Photo of team players and management all of whom are seated or standing, wearing either their playing jerseys with caps, or formal wear. Joseph Warbrick was born in Rotorua, New Zealand, on 1 January 1862, the third of five children. His father, Abraham Warbrick, was originally from England, while his mother, Nga Karauna Paerau, was MƒÅori and the daughter of a NgƒÅti Rangitihi chief. After Joe Warbrick's mother died, his father remarried and had seven more children. Four of his brothersAlfred, Arthur, Fred, and Billywent on to tour with Joe as part of the 1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Native football team. With his family still based in the Bay of Plenty, Joe Warbrick was sent to board at St Stephen's Native School in the Bombay Hills, where he started playing rugby union. While living in Bombay in 1877, he started playing club rugby with Ponsonby in Auckland, even though the club was based well north of Bombay. Warbrick played well enough for Ponsonby to earn selection for Auckland Provincial Clubs (now Auckland) that year despite being only 15 years old. Playing at fullback for them against Otago, he became the youngest person to play first-class rugby in New Zealanda record he still holds . By 1878 Warbrick had left both St Stephen's and Ponsonby and was employed as a public servant. The work required him to relocate regularly, and he moved throughout the North Island for the remainder of his rugby career. By 1879 he was living in Wellington, and represented the provincial team three times that season. He played three further matches for Wellington in 1880, including one against his old province of Auckland. The 1880 match, the first in Auckland for Wellington, was won by the visitors 4‚Äì0. Warbrick was renowned for his drop- kicking, and his goal in the match was the only score; many Aucklanders claimed that his performance was the difference between the two sides.: \\"In the early days in Auckland they used to tell us that Warbrick was the main factor in a match won by Wellington against Aucklandthe one played in 1880.\\" The Australian New South Wales colonial team became the first overseas rugby side to tour New Zealand in 1882 and played seven matches throughout the country. By this point Warbrick was back in Auckland, but this time playing for the North Shore club, and he again won selection for the provincial side. He appeared in both of Auckland's matches against the New South Welshmen: 7‚Äì0 and 18‚Äì4 victories over the tourists. Warwick remained in Auckland the following year when he toured with the province again, playing in away matches against Wellington, Canterbury and Otago. 1884 New Zealand team In 1884 a team of New Zealanders, organised by the Canterbury player and administrator William Millton, and Dunedin businessman Samuel Sleigh, was selected to tour New South Wales. This is now officially regarded as the first New Zealand representative rugby side. Warbrick was included in a squad that was selected from throughout the country; the entire endeavour was performed without the oversight of a national body ‚Äì several provincial rugby unions existed, but the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was not formed until 1892. The squad's 19 players were expected to assemble in Wellington before disembarking for Sydney on 21 May, however Warbrick missed his ship from Auckland and so travelled to Sydney alone. Millton was elected captain, and Sleigh managed the team. The side won all eight of their matches on tour, including the three games against New South Wales. Warbrick appeared in seven matches and scored three drop goals; one of the goals was reportedly kicked from well inside his own half. He played at both fullback and three-quarter, and was noted for his good ball handling and speed, as well as his ability to drop kick. Later provincial career After returning from tour, Warbrick moved to Napier, and in 1885 represented Hawke's Bay provincially, including captaining them against Poverty Bay. By 1886 he was back playing for Auckland, and that year captained them in their wins over both Wellington, and also New South Wales ‚Äì who were again touring the country. He returned to Hawke's Bay for the 1887 season, and played for them against Wellington, Poverty Bay, and Canterbury. Warbrick had returned to Wellington by the 1888 season when he again played for the province. The first British Isles side (now known as the British and Irish Lions) toured New Zealand and Australia in 1888. The side was privately organised, without the sanction or prohibition of England's Rugby Football Union, and toured New Zealand in April and May that year where they played against a number of provincial sides. Although the team was not representative of the best British and Irish players, it did include three internationals with the rest predominantly county representatives. Warbrick was in the Wellington team that faced the tourists on 13 May. The match was ill-tempered, with each side accusing the other of rough play, and eventually finished as a 3‚Äì3 draw.  1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Native football team = Preparations  alt=Photo of team players and management all of whom are seated or standing, in three rows, wearing either their playing jerseys with caps, or formal wear. In early 1888 Warbrick announced plans to assemble a MƒÅori side to face the visiting British during their tour, but he later revealed he wanted to take a team of MƒÅori or part-MƒÅori to tour the British Isles. His ambition was for \\"MƒÅori football\\" to be as famous as Australian cricket, whose national side had already developed a strong rivalry with the English. It is not known exactly when Warbrick had conceived of the idea for this tour, but it was well before the arrival of the British Isles team in April 1888. The touring British did help demonstrate the feasibility of Warbrick's proposal, which was dauntingno New Zealand side had ever toured the Northern Hemisphere. Hearing of Warbrick's plans, civil servant Thomas Eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour, which Warbrick accepted. By May 1888, James Scott, a publican, had joined the partnership. The three men decided that Warbrick would be the team's captain, coach and selector, Scott its manager, and Eyton its promoter. Although Warbrick had chiefly sporting reasons for conducting the tour, for Eyton and Scott profit was the major motivation. A New Zealand MƒÅori side had never been selected ‚Äì the first official side did not play until 1910 ‚Äì but Warbrick's experience in provincial rugby ensured that he was well qualified to select the team. He travelled the country trying to find players who were talented and willing to spend a year on tour. The make-up of the team changed significantly between March 1888 and when the team departed New Zealand in August. Warbrick encountered challenges assembling the side; there was opposition from some players to including part-MƒÅori in the squad, which prompted several early recruits to withdraw. Initially, 20 players were selected for the side, named the \\"New Zealand MƒÅori team\\". Some of these players had strong family and playing links to Warbrick (such as his four brothers). Warbrick was eventually compelled to add five PƒÅkehƒÅ (European non- MƒÅori) players to the squad, which resulted in the side being renamed the \\"New Zealand Native football team\\". Warbrick may have wanted a team of exclusively MƒÅori or part-MƒÅori players, but according to historian Greg Ryan, including the PƒÅkehƒÅ players was \\"necessary to strengthen the Native team and create a more effective combination\\". A further player, Pie Wynyard, was added to the side after they arrived in Britain in November 1888. Domestic tour and British Isles alt=Photo of team players and management all of whom are seated or standing, in four rows, wearing either their playing jerseys with caps, or formal wear. The side's first match was against Hawke's Bay on 23 June 1888, with Warbrick playing in the backs. The match was won 5‚Äì0, and was followed by a second match a week later in which Warbrick contributed 10 points in an 11‚Äì0 victory. The next match was against a strong Auckland side, who defeated the Natives 9‚Äì0. The heavy defeat was costly for the Native team, with Warbrick breaking several bones in his foot. It was his last game until November that year, and the loss prompted the addition of Patrick Keogh ‚Äì one of the five PƒÅkehƒÅ in the side ‚Äì to the squad before its departure from New Zealand. The team departed New Zealand on 1 August 1888, and sailed to England via Melbourne. After their six-week voyage from Australia, the Native team arrived in England on 27 September 1888. Their first match was against Surrey, on 3 October, but Joe Warbrick was still injured and did not play. The side played regularly ‚Äì they averaged just over three games per week while in Britain ‚Äì but Warbrick did not appear until 7 November when the team faced Tynemouth. The match was won 7‚Äì1, but Warbrick ‚Äì who played at fullback ‚Äì exacerbated his foot injury. He managed to play six matches between mid- December and early January before he was again injured. He appeared against Stockport, a match drawn 3‚Äì3, on 12 January, but despite being fit enough to play his form was poor. Warbrick only played twice more in the following month, and was not fit enough to be selected for the team that faced England on 16 February. The match resulted in a controversial 7‚Äì0 loss for the Natives, and included the awarding of two dubious English tries by the referee George Rowland Hill ‚Äì who was also Secretary of the English Rugby Football Union (RFU). The loss and aftermath soured the relationship between Warbrick's team and the RFU ‚Äì who accused the Natives of poor sportsmanship after they had protested at the awarding of the controversial tries. By the time the team departed for Australia in late March they had played 74 matches in Britain, winning 49, losing 20, and drawing 5. However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast David Gage featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick was not the only player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently struggled to find a full complement of 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there ‚Äì a conversion against Devon. The high injury toll and congested schedule contributed to complaints about Joe Warbrick's behaviour. His comments to the English press ‚Äì who directed much of their focus towards him ‚Äì were viewed negatively by some members of the squad; he was accused of neglecting to acknowledge the contributions of players such as Thomas Ellison, Gage, Keogh, and Edward McCausland but to extol the efforts of himself and his brothers. Warbrick said of his time in the British Isles: \\"My impression of England and its people during the tour was a very favourable one, more especially does this apply to private individuals. I found them everywhere very kind and attentive and apparently anxious to make one's visit as pleasant as possible\\". The term \\"private individuals\\" may have been used to exclude from praise both the RFU and London press. Following the tour he also criticised the partiality of the English referees, and believed that the English administrators displayed a double standard in their treatment of the Natives; the RFU treated the Native team's motives for touring with suspicion, believing the enterprise to be speculative and criticising them for not upholding the amateur principles the RFU liked to espouse. Yet the RFU continued to select Andrew Stoddart for England, despite him touring with the speculative and unsanctioned 1888 British team that travelled to New Zealand and Australia.  Australia and return to New Zealand  Warbrick and the team sailed to Australia for a leg of their tour described by historian Greg Ryan as \\"little more than a testimony to the motives of Scott and Eyton as speculators.\\" Their time in Australia started in Victoria, where the side mostly played Victorian Rules Football against Melbourne clubs. These matches were played for financial rather than sporting reasons, and the team had little success at the sport. While the side only played a single rugby match in Victoria, in New South Wales and Queensland they almost exclusively played rugby. Warbrick made few appearances in Australia ‚Äì two in total ‚Äì but continued functioning as team captain. The Natives had not lost a rugby match in Australia when they played their second match against the Queensland representative side. The first match was won 22‚Äì0, and the second ‚Äì held on 20 July ‚Äì was expected to be another comfortable victory for the Natives. However, at half-time the scores were level, and with the exception of Billy Warbrick, the Natives had played poorly. There were rumours that four of the Natives had been paid by local bookmakers to throw the match. When Joe Warbrick spoke to the team at half-time, he threatened to expose the accused players; this was enough to prompt an improvement in the Natives' play, and the side recovered to win 11‚Äì7. The team returned to New Zealand in August 1889, but the Queensland controversy still hung over the side. The Northern Rugby Union (later renamed the Queensland Rugby Union) did not take any action over the accusations, but the Otago Rugby Union (ORU) decided to conduct an inquiry. The matter was not resolved until after the team arrived in Dunedin when the ORU announced there was no evidence \\"justifying the accusations\\", and dismissed taking any further action. The team continued to travel north and to play fixtures throughout the country. Joe Warbrick had played an earlier match in Gore ‚Äì against Mataura District XVI ‚Äì where he again suffered injury. The team's final match was against Auckland on 24 August. The fixture was lost 7‚Äì2, but by this point several Native's players had departed the team, including Keogh, Ellison and Gage. Despite the grueling schedule and high number of injuries, the loss to Auckland ended a remarkable streak that had started with a victory over Widnes on 9 March; the Natives had not lost a rugby game in 31 matches, winning 30 and drawing the other. The Natives played a total of 107 rugby matches, including 74 in the British Isles, and the tour remains the longest in the sport's history.  Retirement and later life  Warbrick retired from rugby at the conclusion of the Natives' tour. He moved to the Bay of Plenty to farm, and occasionally turned out for the Tauranga representative team. Five years after he retired he made a one-match first-class comeback when he played for Auckland against Taranaki in 1894. After this match, an Auckland newspaper wrote: Example of an eruption of Waimangu Geyser in 1903 Warbrick married Harriet Burt with whom he had one daughter, and he later worked as a tourist guide in the Rotorua area, where his brother Alfred was the Chief Government Guide. On 30 August 1903, while working with his brother in the geothermal region of the area, Joe Warbrick was killed. The Waimangu Geyserthen the largest geyser in the worldunexpectedly erupted with Joe Warbrick and several tourists in the vicinity; four of them, including Warbrick, were killed instantly by the superheated water ejected during the eruption before they were swept towards Lake Rotomahana. Joe Warbrick had warned one of the tourists not to venture too close to the geyser; however, she insisted on moving closer to get a better photograph. Warbrick accompanied her, and barely two minutes later the geyser erupted and killed the entire party. Impact and legacy As the captain and instigator of the 1888‚Äì89 Nativesthe first New Zealand team to tour the British IslesWarbrick had a lasting impact on the development of rugby in his homeland. When the Natives returned from tour they introduced a style of rugby as good as any ever seen in the country. According to Ryan, \\"their brand of sensational running style and combined forward play had never been seen in New Zealand.\\" The speculative nature of the tour, which was outside the control of an official authority, concerned many of the provincial unions and gave further momentum to efforts to form a national body. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was founded which would, among other things, organise any representative tours. Many of the Natives went on to contribute to rugby as representative players, administrators, or referees. Two players, Ellison and Gage, went on to captain New Zealand. In 2008 Warbrick was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame, and is a member of the MƒÅori Sports Awards Hall of Fame. A short film, Warbrick, written and directed by brothers Pere and Meihana Durie, was released in 2009 and depicts Joe Warbrick preparing an injury-depleted Natives squad for a match. The film was played for the All Blacks during their preparations for a match against Australia in 2009.

She is best known for her work as a novelist and a writer/producer on the acclaimed Amazon original series, Transparent. Liebegott has taught creative writing at University of California, San Diego and Mills College. She is a recipient of a Poetry Fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts. She is the author of The Beautifully Worthless; The IHOP Papers; and Cha-Ching!. Liebegott currently resides in Los Angeles and recently finished her fourth book, The Summer of Dead Birds. Career= Non-Profit Work  Liebegott was the managing director at RADAR Productions a non-profit in San Francisco whose mission is to \\"give voice to innovative queer and outsider writers and artists whose work authentically reflects the LGBTQA community's diverse experiences.\\" RADAR Productions held an annual queer artists' retreat, THE RADAR LAB, in Akumal, Mexico that Liebegott helped found and run. Liebegott has had a long relationship with small press publishing and zine making. She was the founding editor at Writers Among Artists, which published two art and poetry anthologies: Faggot Dinosaur and Vincent Van Go - Gogh.  Writing  In 2005, Liebegott published her first book, The Beautifully Worthless, on Suspect Thoughts Press. This queer, female modern day road epic follows a runaway waitress and her Dalmatian, Rorschach, across America. Liebegott wanted to subvert the epic poem by putting a queer female at the center of the book. The Beautifully Worthless, is a hybrid work of poems, letters, lists and prose pieces that form a narrative. Liebegott has traveled the U.S. extensively, including touring on Sister Spit's Ramblin' Road Show with longtime gal pal Michelle Tea. Traveling and the open road are recurrent themes in Liebegott's work, which often provides her with the context to explore the experiences of living on the margins, from perspectives beyond that of straight male privilege. When asked about the lack of female road stories in contemporary literature, Liebegott has expressed that there isn't a lack of female road narratives, so much as there aren't enough publishers choosing to print these works. Liebegott's second book, The IHOP Papers, is a coming of age novel following a troubled queer waitress. It's set in early 1990s San Francisco during the AIDS epidemic. The novel won the Ferro-Grumley Award for LGBT Literature in 2008 and a Lambda Literary Award for Women's Fiction. Originally inspired to write the third book in a planned trilogy (started by The Beautifully Worthless and followed by The Summer of Dead Birds) Liebegott traveled by train across the United States interviewing female poets. The project became The Heart has many Doors--, which takes its title from the Emily Dickinson poem of the same name. Excerpts from these interviews appeared monthly on The Believer Logger.logger.believermag.com The second book of this trilogy, The Summer of Dead Birds, had \\"never seen the light of day\\" until Feminist Press decided to publish it in 2019. Liebegott, whose uncle was a blackjack dealer, released her novel Cha-Ching! in March 2013 co-published by City Lights and Sister Spit. Cha-Ching! follows a butch dyke named Theo who moves from San Francisco to Brooklyn and deals with addictions to gambling, alcohol and drugs. Animals often play significant roles in her work. Liebegott has cared for rescued dogs and cats. The 2013 reprint of The Beautifully Worthless was dedicated to Rorschach, her late dog, and inspiration for the character in the book. Liebegott has stated that a dream of hers is to one day own a farm filled with rescued animals. Some time in 2011 she rescued a street dog from Mexico and flew her back to San Francisco.  Television and Upcoming Works  In 2014 Liebegott joined the writing staff of Amazon's original series Transparent, created by Jill Soloway. Ali has written and produced for the entire run of Transparent, which has earned a Peabody Award and multiple Golden Globe and Emmy Awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy. = Transparent Episodes = * \\"Wedge\\" (2014) * ‚ÄúMan on the Land\\" (2015) * ‚ÄúLife Sucks and Then You Die\\" (2016) * ‚ÄúGroin Anomaly\\" (2017) * ‚ÄúBabar the Borrible\\" (2017) Liebegott's television acting work has included roles on Transparent, Maron, and Ten Days in the Valley. She can also be found doing standup throughout Los Angeles as both herself and her dog, Flaca. Liebegott's collection of poems, The Summer of Dead Birds, is slated to be published in 2019 by the Feminist Press. She also plans to finish a novel which began as an illustrated project that includes over three hundred pen, ink, and watercolor drawings. The project, about a post-9/11 obsessive duck feeder, was started in 2001 and is titled The Crumb People.  Awards  Liebegott won the 2009 Ferro-Grumley Award for LGBT literature, for The IHOP Papers. She has won two Lambda Literary Awards, in the categories of Lesbian Debut Fiction for The Beautifully Worthless in 2006, and Lesbian Fiction for The IHOP Papers in 2008. In 2015, Liebegott, along with the rest of the writing staff, was honored with a Peabody Award for Season 2 of Transparent.

By 1758 the population had risen to 88 and reached just under 100 by the end of the century. This figure remained fairly constant from the 18th century on until 1851 when 36 islanders emigrated to Australia on board the Priscilla, a loss from which the island never fully recovered.Maclean, Charles (1977) Island on the Edge of the World: the Story of St. Kilda, Canongate One factor in the decline was the influence of religion. A missionary called Alexander Buchan came to St Kilda in 1705, but despite a lengthy stay there the idea of organised religion did not seem to take hold. This changed when Rev John MacDonald, the 'Apostle of the North' arrived in 1822. He set about his mission with zeal, preaching thirteen lengthy sermons during his first eleven days there. He returned regularly and fund-raised on behalf of the St Kildans, although privately he was appalled by their lack of religious knowledge. The islanders took to him with enthusiasm and wept when he left for the last time eight years later. His successor, who arrived on 3 July 1830 was Rev Neil Mackenzie, a resident Church of Scotland minister who greatly improved the conditions of the inhabitants. He re-organised island agriculture, was instrumental in the rebuilding of the village (see below) and supervised the building of a new church and manse. With help from the Gaelic School Society, MacKenzie and his wife introduced formal education to Hirta, beginning a daily school to teach reading, writing and arithmetic and a Sunday school for religious education. Mackenzie left in 1844 and although he had clearly achieved a great deal, the weakness of the St Kildan's dependence on an external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev John Mackay, a minister in the new Free Church of Scotland. Mackay was a religious zealot who may have done more than any single individual to destroy the St Kildan way of life. He introduced a routine of three two to three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: > The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the clink of the bell the > whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the > ground. It is considered sinful to look to the right or to the left.John > Sands MP, quoted in Maclean (1972) page 117. He is elsewhere recorded as > having visited in 1877 and it is clear he travelled to St Kilda on more than > one occasion. The excessive time spent in religious gatherings began to interfere seriously with the practical routines of running the island. Old ladies and children who made a noise in church were lectured at length and warned of the dire punishments they could expect in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday only to be informed by the minister that the islanders had to spend the day preparing for church on the Sabbath and it was Monday before any supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a bible wherever they went. The St Kildans endured Mackay for twenty four years. Stac Lee, St Kilda. Tourism had a different but similarly de-stabilising impact on St Kilda. During the 19th century steamers began to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and bird's eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists clearly regarded them as curiosities. The boats also brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80% during the late nineteenth century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough became a regular feature of life.Cooper, Derek (1979) Road to the Isles: Travellers in the Hebrides 1770‚Äì1914. London. Routledge & Kegan Paul.\\"Life in St. Kilda\\", an account by J. Sands in Chambers's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Art, 1877. Retrieved 1 January 2007. By the turn of the 20th century formal schooling had become a feature of the islands and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English in addition to their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by Reverend Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. There had been some talk of an evacuation in 1875 during MacKay's period of tenure, but despite occasional food shortages and flu epidemic in 1913 the population was stable at between 75 and 80 and there was no obvious sign that within a few years the millennia old occupation of the island was to end.Steel, Tom (1988) The Life and Death of St. Kilda, London, Fontana World War One Early in World War I the Royal Navy erected a signal station on Hirta and daily communications with the mainland were established for the first time in St Kilda's history. In a belated response, a German submarine arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy-two shells in all were fired and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church and jetty storehouse were also damaged but there was no loss of life. One eye-witness recalled > It wasn't what you would call a bad submarine because it could have blowed > every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted > Admiralty property. One lamb was killed‚Ä¶ all the cattle ran from one side of > the island to the other when they heard the shots.Neil Gilles, quoted in > Steel (1988) op cit page 167. As a result of this attack a Mark II QF gun was erected on a promontory overlooking Village Bay, but it was never fired in anger. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders was the introduction of regular contact with the outside world and the slow development of a money-based economy, both of which made life easier, but less self-reliant. These were both factors in the evacuation of the island only a little more than a decade later. Evacuation Boreray, Stac Lee, and Stac an Armin (left) from the heights of Conachair There were thus numerous reasons for the evacuation. The islands had existed for centuries with only fleeting contacts with the rest of the world. The advent of tourism and the presence of the military in World War One had enabled the islanders to understand that there were alternatives to the privations they had routinely suffered. Despite the provision of a small jetty in 1902 the islands remained at the mercy of the weather.Even in the 21st century this is problem. The National Trust reported in 2006 that it was cancelling 2007 work parties as \\"adverse weather conditions resulted in our supplies failing to reach St Kilda and our next opportunity to get supplies out is May 2007.\\" NTS work party information Retrieved 18 March 2007 The authorities were unable to do much to assist them, although reliable radios and other infrastructure denied to the civilian islanders were later to be provided for the military base at a cost of millions of pounds.Steel (1988) op cit quotes ¬£20 million. After World War One most of the young men left the island and the population fell from 73 in 1920 to 37 in 1928. After the death of four men from influenza in 1926, and a succession of crop failures in the 1920s, the last straw came with the death from appendicitis of a young woman, Mary Gillies, in January 1930. On 29 August 1930, the last 36 inhabitants were evacuated to Morvern on the Scottish mainland at their own request. > The morning of the evacuation promised a perfect day.

David & Charles. and for the next twenty six years the island experienced quietude, save for the occasional summer visit from a returning St Kildan family. Later military events The islands took no active part in World War II during which they were completely abandoned, but there are three aircraft crash sites from that period. A Beaufighter LX798 based at Port Ellen on Islay crashed into Conachair within 100 metres of the summit on the night of 3‚Äì4 June 1943. A year later, just before midnight on 7 June 1944, the day after D-Day, a Sunderland flying boat ML858 was wrecked at the head of Gleann Mor. There is a small plaque in the kirk dedicated to those who lost their lives in this accident.Quine, David (2000) St. Kilda, Grantown- on-Spey, Colin Baxter Island Guides A Wellington bomber crashed on the south coast of Soay at some point in 1943. It was not until 1978 that any formal attempt was made to investigate the wreck, and its identity has not been absolutely determined. Amongst the wreckage a Royal Canadian Air Force cap badge was discovered, which suggests it may have been LA995 which lost during a flight on 28 September 1943. In 1955 the British government decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile tracking range based in Benbecula, where test firings and flights are carried out. Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited once again. A variety of new military buildings and masts have since been erected, including the island's first licensed premises, the 'Puff Inn'. The Ministry of Defence leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee. The main island of Hirta is still occupied all year round by a small number of civilians working in the military base there.NTS advice to visitors Retrieved 18 March 2007.

TLR1 recognizes pathogen- associated molecular pattern with a specificity for gram-positive bacteria. TLR1 has also been designated as CD281 (cluster of differentiation 281). TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This gene is ubiquitously expressed, and at higher levels than other TLR genes. Different length transcripts presumably resulting from use of alternative polyadenylation site, and/or from alternative splicing, have been noted for this gene. TLR1 recognizes peptidoglycan and (triacyl) lipopeptides in concert with TLR2 (as a heterodimer). Toll-like receptors, including TLR-1, found on the epithelial cell layer that lines the small and large intestine are important players in the management of the gut microbiota and detection of pathogens.

Its headquarters is in Kabul, Afghanistan. Background and history FINCA Afghanistan was founded on August 1, 2003 through grants and loans supplied by several donors and funding agencies. Her Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan announced the launching of the program in 2002. FINCA Afghanistan began lending operations in the city of Herat on February 24, 2004. By the end of its first year in operation, the organization had reached over 4,500 clients, an outstanding loan portfolio of almost $700,000, and a repayment rate of 100%. The rapid expansion achieved in less than a year was the first evidence of the pent-up demand for financial services and economic opportunity among Afghanistan's poor. Recognizing that these needs were not limited to Herat, FINCA initiated an ambitious long-term expansion plan to spread across Afghanistan, beginning with Kabul and Nangarhar in 2005, followed by Balkh, Laghman, Kunar and Parwan in 2006, and Kunduz in 2007. In each of these provinces, FINCA has established branch and market offices in the provincial capital, as well as outlying cities and districts. Currently, FINCA Afghanistan has a total of over 33,289 clients and $4,403,106 in outstanding loans. Almost 10,000 of these clients are women. Other groups targeted in the program include ethnic minorities, returning refugees, orphans, and young former combatants. FINCA Afghanistan's Islamic banking products One of the major elements of FINCA‚Äôs success in Afghanistan has been its deference towards Islamic banking principles. Since its inception, FINCA Afghanistan has offered a line of sharia-compliant microfinance products, developed after careful vetting with local religious leaders, and confirmed through a fatwa acquired from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt (the world‚Äôs most respected Islamic institution of higher learning). Its current line of Murabaha loan products is based on an agreement where the seller (i.e. FINCA) expressly mentions the cost he has incurred on the commodities to be sold and sells it to another person (the client) by adding a markup on the original cost, which is known to the buyer. It is one of the most popular modes of exchange used by banks in Islamic countries to promote interest-free transactions (interest being forbidden by sharia law). Aside from being Afghanistan‚Äôs first sharia-compliant microfinance organization, FINCA can perhaps claim to have created one of the world‚Äôs first Murabaha group-lending products. Funding and partnerships FINCA Afghanistan receives its primary funding from the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) through a $30 million grant. In November 2006, this grant was augmented by $10 million through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as part of an $80 million rural microfinance project to promote development and stability in Afghanistan. The project, the Agriculture, Rural Investment and Enterprise Strengthening (ARIES) Program, will also complement USAID's existing Alternative Livelihoods Program and will help establish a market-based, wholesale Rural Investment Fund to provide financing to cooperatives, farmers' associations, and small and midsize enterprises throughout the country, in a push to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppies. FINCA Afghanistan is also a board member of the Afghanistan Mircrofinance Association (AMA).

It was first described by Emilio Yunis and Humberto V√°ron from the National University of Colombia. Genetics This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Several mutations in the FIG4-encoding gene were found to cause Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome. Some of these mutations result in complete loss of protein function; others involve amino-acid replacements at highly conserved residues. Not all mutations in the FIG4 gene result Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome. Some mutations lead to various forms of Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 11, and bilateral temporooccipital polymicrogyria. Patients affected with Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome are homozygous, compound homozygous, or compound heterozygous for deleterious mutations in FIG4.  Animal model  Spongiform degeneration of mouse brains caused by altering PI3P to PI(3,5)P2 conversion is associated with human Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by accumulation of Lc3II, p62, and LAMP2 proteins, which also contributes to inclusion body disease. Manipulation of this signaling lipid involves culturing fibroblasts obtained by insertion of ETn2-beta(early transposon 2-beta) into intron 18 of FIG4 gene in vacuolar membrane of mice labeled pale tremor (plt). These fibroblasts fill with immunoreactive large vacuoles; but more importantly their abnormal concentration of PI(3,5)P2 demonstrates conserved function of mammalian FIG4 and late endosome-lysosome axis failure responsible for lack of apoptosis of neurons and Schwann cells (but large motor axons are still lost while demyelination still happens). In contrast, homozygous FIG4 defective (FIG4-/-) mice have a reduction of myelin, especially in optic nerves; but this detriment is rescued by an overexpression of human FIG4 I41T at low-level function. While FIG4-null adult mice have macroscopically normal brains with increments in apoptosis and neuronal density with delayed cell maturation, neonatal mice maintain all neurologic defects. FIG4 expression in mouse brain cells is also comparable to that of calvaria, osteoblasts, and bone marrow cells.  Pathophysiology  The mechanism of mutation in FIG4 causing Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome involves altering conversion of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) to signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate(PI(3,5)P2). Because this conversion in endosomal membranes changes dynamically with fission and fusion events to create/absorb intracellular transport vesicles, enlarged cytoplasmic vacuoles have been found in patient neurons, muscle, and cartilage. These have been identified as intracytoplasmic vacuoles(fluid sacs inside cellular cytoplasm) causing excessive build-up of vacuolated macrophages in bone marrow and pericardial fluid in the heart. Fluids may also accumulate in a choroid spaces under the retina, causing central serous retinopathy or chorioretinopathy and possibly vision loss. Paradoxically, overexpression of FIG4 does not yield obvious morphologic phenotype of these fluids accumulating, but alters PI(3,5)P2 levels making cells prone to expansion through dilation of intracellular membranes. Under expression, on the other hand, enhances endosome carrier and formation of vesicles/multivesicular bodies. Central nervous system dysfunction and extensive skeletal anomalies suggest a role for Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, or PI(3,5)P2, signaling in skeletal development and maintenance. Diagnosis Features of Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome include growth retardation before and after birth, defective growth of the bones of the skull along with complete or partial absence of the shoulder blades and characteristic facial features. Additional symptoms may include abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes including missing nails/fingers. In most cases, infants with this disorder experience severe feeding problems and respiratory difficulties. In addition, affected infants may have heart defects. Osteodysplasties or bone abnormalities may be severe enough to become fatal in as little as 10 weeks of age, making lethality extremely common during infancy.  Skeletal  Defects include cleidocranial dysplasia as abnormal bone development through hypoplastic (absent) clavicles, induced macrocrania (abnormal increase of skull), and diastasis (separation) of sutures. Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome also causes digital anomalies as most patients show aplasia (absence) of thumbs as well as distal phalanges or hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of proximal phalanx with absence and/or agenesis of halluces' (big toes') distal phalanxes sometimes with absent. Pelvic dysplasia may also be present, causing hips to be retracted and delineated through bilateral dislocation. These deformities in addition to microcephaly and reduced ossification from the disease might be partially due to the affected individual's under-mineralized skeleton.  Neurologic  Intraneural inclusions (bodies within neural cells) with vacuolar degeneration are prominent mostly in the patient's thalamic nuclei, dentante nuclei, cerebellar cortex, and inferior olivary nuclei. Hypoplasia of frontal lobes, corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis connecting the two brain hemispheres along with polymicrogyria causing excessive folding leading to an abnormally thick cortex are also phenotypes of this disorder.  Facial  Obvious signs of Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome include soft and large fontanelles, high forehead, prominent eyes, large ears with hypoplastic lobes, low nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, short philtrum above the lip, high-arched palate at the roof of mouth, micrognathia or small jaw, and sparse hair (Hypotrichosis) with absent eyebrows and eyelashes. Treatment Early intervention is considered important. For infants, breathing and feeding difficulties, are monitored. Therapies used are \\"symptomatic and supportive.\\" Epidemiology Yunis‚ÄìVaron syndrome has been described relatively recently in the 1980s and since then less than 15 cases have been reported around the world. Many of the infants did not survive beyond one year of age.

Formation  The first violinist Veronika Jar≈Ø≈°kov√° was inspired to form the quartet after she attended concerts by the ≈†kampa Quartet in which her husband Peter Jar≈Ø≈°ek was the cellist. She recruited other players in Prague, some of whom had studied with the same teachers. Initially the group consisted of, besides Jar≈Ø≈°kov√°, Kate≈ôina Gemrotov√° (second violin), Pavel Nikl (violist), and Luk√°≈° Pol√°k (cellist). After its formation Pol√°k decided to leave because of incompatibility, so the two quartets ended up exchanging cellists, with Jar≈Ø≈°kova's husband joining the Haas Quartet and Pol√°k joining the ≈†kampa Quartet. Later the second violinist (Gemrotov√°) was replaced by Marie Fuxov√°, who in September 2008 was replaced by Eva Karov√°, the youngest member in the group at 25 years of age (in November 2009); the oldest was only 33.Stearns, David Patrick. \\"A Quartet for Our Time\\" Gramophone, 87:1054 (February 2010), pp. 38-41. In July 2012, Karov√° was herself replaced by Marek Zwiebel as second violinist. The quartet is named after the Czech composer Pavel Haas (1899-1944), who was deported from Czechoslovakia in 1941, initially imprisoned at the work camp Terezin, and finally died at Auschwitz. Although aware of the significance of the circumstances of Haas's final years, the group did not intend to make a statement about the Holocaust, but rather selected the name primarily because of his importance to Czech music and in particular because of his three string quartets, all of which they have now recorded. Jar≈Ø≈°kov√° has said: \\"We know personally the daughter of Pavel Haas. She doesn't like to speak about the time before the war. She showed us some papers and a book he wrote about her when she was born.\\" Jar≈Ø≈°ek added: \\"She also showed us the reviews. Every review of his Second Quartet was bad.\\"  Mentors  The Haas Quartet has studied and worked with members of the Quartetto Italiano, Quatuor Mosa√Øques, Borodin Quartet, and the Amadeus Quartet. Other important mentors include Walter Levin (founder of the LaSalle Quartet) and particularly the Smetana Quartet's viola player, Milan ≈†kampa, who worked with the group over a period of many years.

Variations Ducati produced several variations of the 748, starting with the basic 748 Biposto (meaning \\"two seat\\") in 1994 and then the 1995‚Äì96 748SP and 1996‚Äì99 748SPS followed as more powerful options. The different variations of the engine (weighing close to each, produced at least . The SP and SPS engines were in a higher state of tune and also came only as monoposto (meaning \\"single seat\\"), although it was possible to order the base 748 with a monoposto option, and were intended as homologation machines for World Supersport racing. Other extras over the base model included Ohlins rear shock and fully floating cast-iron Brembo brake disks. The engines also came with an oil cooler. In 2000, Ducati revamped their 748 model line to include a third variation. The base model was now known as the 748E, available as Biposto or Monoposto, with 3-spoke gold wheels and gold frame. Gone were the quick-release Dzus fasteners on the fairing, replaced with plain fairing fasteners, and the frame also had a fixed steering head angle. The rear shock was a Sachs-Boge unit with Showa forks. This helped to keep costs down. The intermediate model was known as the 748S. This had lighter 5-spoke Marchesini wheels in grey to match the grey frame, also retaining the earlier adjustable steering head. The rear shock was now a Showa unit with Showa forks at the front, making use of Titanium-Nitride (TiN) coating on the fork stanchions to \\"reduce stiction\\", which also gave it a gold coloring. The engine was the same as the 748E. The top of the range model was now the 748R, Ducati's racing homologation model produced only in very limited numbers. This engine was again a derivative of the SPS model but with more tuning. The main difference is that the R model has an overhead shower-injector arrangement compared to the 748E and S model's traditional throttle bodies, titanium connecting rods, titanium valves and more extreme valve timing. As such, the 748R has a larger, two-part airbox and thus the frame was also different in order to accommodate this. The suspension choice was Ohlins for both the rear shock and front forks, although the very first models in 2000 used Showa titanium nitride (TiN) front forks and a Showa shock absorber. The engine included a very basic slipper clutch to ensure that this would then be homologated for use in racing, as well as an oil cooler. Ducati also produced a very limited run (less than 20) of 748RS machines, which were intended as full racing machines and as such came with no road-going equipment (lights, odometer, mirrors). The engine internals and components were vastly different from any road-based Ducati, using a variety of light-weight, high-strength materials making them extremely expensive to purchase, run and maintain. The RS came with a 54 mm exhaust system and a slightly smaller size and gauge of Chromoly tubing was used on the frame to reduce weight even further. In 2002, Ducati also produced the limited edition 748S Senna, which used the same components as the 748S but had flat grey body work, grey frame, and red Marchesini 5 spoke wheels. It only came in a Monoposto variation. End of production and successor Production of the Ducati 748 ended in 2002. It was available for purchase alongside its successor, the 749, until dealer stocks were exhausted.

The first version of El cuerpo del deseo was En cuerpo ajeno,http://www.marketingymedios.com/marketingymedios/magazine/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002840219 produced by RTI Colombia in 1992. In India, the show was broadcast on Firangi Channel in Hindi as Second Chance. In Pakistan, the show was broadcast on Urdu 1 with Urdu dub as Isabel ‚Äì Meri Akhri Mohabbat. Plot The story features Pedro Jos√© Donoso (Andr√©s Garc√≠a), a wealthy old man who lives in a big mansion with his daughter Angela and his servants. He falls in love with and marries a gorgeous younger woman, Isabel Arroyo (Lorena Rojas). He dies suddenly, and Isabel marries employee Andres Corona. But Pedro Jose Donoso returns to Earth through transmigration: (the passing of a soul into another body after death), in the body of Salvador Cerinza (Mario Cimarro), a handsome (yet poor) family man. Salvador was actually a poor man who lived with his wife Cantalicia and son Moncho, but Pedro's soul forced Salvador's soul to leave Salvador's body, although Salvador hadn't died. Pedro Jos√© searches for everything he lost, uncovering secrets, truths and deceptions. Ultimately, he must set things straight and save those who truly loved him, and reclaim the heart of beautiful Isabel. Pedro changes his name to Salvador and enters his mansion as a poor driver. Isabel feels attracted and falls in love with him. Both have sex several times and secretly Isabel kills Andres and marries Salvador. Angela marries Antonio, the maid Abigail's son. Antonio and Angela love each other very much. Pedro thinks that his death was not natural. He believes that Isabel killed him by giving him poison. Isabel did not give him poison in truth. When Isabel discovers that Salvador is Pedro, she asks him to forgive her and tells him the truth. Pedro and Isabel reunite and leave the mansion without informing anyone. However, Isabel's Aunt, Miss Rebecca believes that Salvador might have taken Isabel somewhere so that he can kill her and grab her wealth, so she and the butler, Walter, inform the police. The police chase Pedro and Isabel. Isabel tells Pedro that she doesn't want to be separated from him again, so she drives the car into a river. Isabel dies, so Pedro's soul also leaves his body. Both souls live together and rest in peace forever. Then, the real Salvador's soul enters Salvador's body again. Isabel is buried with Pedro, and Salvador lives in Pedro's mansion for six months, but keeps on irritating everyone. Everyone finds out the truth about Pedro's transmigration and everyone is happy that finally Isabel and Pedro have reunited, but they want to get rid of the real Salvador as he was very dirty. Finally, they find Cantalicia and Moncho, and leave Salvador with him. Salvador becomes very happy. Also, Angela gives birth to a son whom they name Don Pedro.

Polruan also has a blockhouse fortification that guards the entrance to the river Fowey, one of a pair -- its partner being situated on the Fowey side of the river. Between the two blockhouses was strung a defensive chain to prevent enemy ships entering the harbour, the chain being lowered for friendly vessels. This was primarily used during the wars with the Dutch.

D√πn is an island in St Kilda, Scotland. It is nearly long. Its name simply means \\"fort\\" in Scottish Gaelic (for more information, see \\"dun\\"), but the fort itself has been lost - old maps show it on Gob an D√πin (), which is at the seaward end. Though D√πn is almost joined to Hirta at Ruiaval, the two islands are separated by Caolas an D√πin (the straits of D√πn). This prevents Soay sheep from Hirta straying onto the island, and thus it is more vegetated. The small island is home to the largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Before 1828, St Kilda was their only British Isles breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as at Fowlsheugh.Fisher, James & Waterston, George (Nov. 1941) The Breeding Distribution, History and Population of The Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) in the British Isles.

The Gilbert Synergie was the official match ball of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, replacing the Gilbert Xact used in Australia during the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The ball was introduced in time for the 2006 Autumn internationals. The Synergie differs in a number of ways from the Xact -- mainly with the advancement with the technology of the matrix grip pattern. The matrix uses star-shapes instead of the conventional round shapes, resulting in superior handling, in particular in wet conditions and kicking. A Gilbert engineer said of the Synergie that \\"we have been working on the new ball for Rugby World Cup 2007 for some time now and are confident that we have again developed a ball that will deliver the best all-round performance ever. A Multi Matrix grip pattern and reaction laminate construction allows the Synergie match ball to deliver improved handling whilst still maintaining the unique kicking performance of the current Xact ball\\".

Colloquially it refers to British citizens or residents whose parents are of two or more different races or ethnic backgrounds. Mixed race people are the fastest growing ethnic group in the UK and numbered 1.25 million in the 2011 census. Statistics A number of academics have pointed out that the ethnicity classification employed in the census and other official statistics in the UK since 1991 involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race. Aspinall notes that sustained academic attention has been focused on \\"how the censuses measure ethnicity, especially the use of dimensions that many claim have little to do with ethnicity, such as skin colour, race, and nationality\\". 2001 was the first census which asked about mixed race identity. In that census, 677,177 classified themselves as of mixed ethnicity, making up 1.2 percent of the UK population. The 2011 Census gave the figure as 2.2% for England and Wales. Office for National Statistics estimates suggest that 956,700 mixed- ethnicity people were resident in England (as opposed to the whole of the UK) as of mid-2009, compared to 654,000 at mid-2001. As of May 2011, this figure surpassed 1 million. It was estimated in 2007 that, by 2020, 1.24 million people in the UK would be of mixed race. Research conducted by the BBC, however, suggests that the mixed race population could already be twice the official estimate figure - up to 2 million. According to The Economist in October 2020, the 2011 census figure \\"is probably an undercount, since not all children of mixed marriages will have ticked one of the mixed categories, and the number is likely to have grown since the census\\". 3.5 percent of all births in England and Wales in 2005 were mixed-ethnicity babies, with 0.9 percent being Mixed White and Black Caribbean, 0.5 percent White and Black African, 0.8 percent White and Asian, and 1.3 percent any other mixed background. Subgroups In England and Wales, the 2001 census included four sub-categories of mixed ethnic combinations: \\"White and Black Caribbean\\", \\"Mixed White and Black African\\", \\"Mixed White and Asian\\" and \\"Any other Mixed background\\", with the latter allowing people to write in their ethnicity. Analysis of census results shows that, in England and Wales only, 237,000 people stated their ethnicity as Mixed White and Black Caribbean, 189,000 as Mixed White and Asian, 156,000 as Other Mixed, and 79,000 Mixed White and Black African.

The college offers apprenticeships, full-time, part-time further and higher education courses. Since the start of the academic year of 2017, North Warwickshire and Hinckley College merged with South Leicestershire College to form North Warwickshire and South Leicestershire College. History The college began in 1910 as the 'Nuneaton Technical College' and the 'Nuneaton School of Art', with the Technical College catering mainly to mining students. In 1913 the College moved to a larger building containing a laboratory, lecture room, drawing room and handicraft room only for the college to close between 1914 and 1919 due to the First World War. When the College reopened after the war it changed its structure to include general education courses. The College grew further and relocated again in 1923 and became the 'County Mining and Technical School' in 1932. The size and scope of the education provided continued to grow over the next two decades and in 1952 the Art School was amalgamated with the college to form the 'Nuneaton Technical College and School of Art' and in 1958 the main campus was relocated to Hinckley Road where it remains. The college was subsequently renamed to 'North Warwickshire College of Technology and Art\\" until the merger with Hinckley College to become North Warwickshire and Hinckley College in 1996. Campus developments New Hinckley Campus In September 2011, the College opened a new Hinckley Campus located on Lower Bond Street in the town centre.

Village banking has its roots in ancient cultures and was most recently adopted for use by micro-finance institutions (MFIs) as a way to control costs. Early MFI village banking methods were innovated by Grameen Bank and then later developed by groups such as FINCA International founder John Hatch. Among US-based non- profit agencies there are at least 31 microfinance institutions (MFIs) that have collectively created over 800 village banking programs in at least 90 countries. And in many of these countries there are host-country MFIs‚Äîsometimes dozens‚Äîthat are village banking practitioners as well. Methodology A village bank is an informal self-help support group of 20-30 members, predominantly female heads-of-household. If the program is ‚Äúon mission‚Äù, in a normal village bank about 50% of all new members entering the program will be severely poor‚Äîrepresenting families with a daily per-capita expenditure (DPCE) of less than US$1; the rest are moderately poor (DPCE=$1‚Äì2/day) or non-poor (DPCE >$2). These women meet once a week in the home of one of their members to avail themselves of working capital loans, a safe place to save, skill training, mentoring, and motivation. Loans normally start at $50‚Äì$100 and are linked to savings such that the more a client saves the more she can borrow. The normal loan period is four months and is repaid in 16 weekly installments. At the end of 2006, 95% of clients covered by a benchmark sample of 71 NGOs and institutions engaged in village bank lending were women.MicroBanking Bulletin, Issue 15, MIX, Washington, August 2007, p. 47 To eliminate the need for collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving bank loans), village banks rely on a variation of the solidarity lending methodology. It relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure makes it possible for even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network. Village banks are highly democratic, self-managed, grassroots organizations. They elect their own leaders, select their own members, create their own bylaws, do their own bookkeeping, manage all funds, disburse and deposit all funds, resolve loan delinquency problems, and levy their own fines on members who come late, miss meetings, or fall behind in their payments. There was some hope in the early years of village bank development that these small village organizations could become independent and self-financing, but this hope was later abandoned. Most village banks in operation today are directly supervised by the staff of a local NGO or microfinance institution, from which they receive much of their loan financing. Sources of funds Market interest rates apply to village bank loans. At the end of 2006, the average portfolio yield for a sample 71 microfinance institutions engaged in village banking was 27.7%, after removing the effect of local inflation.MicroBanking Bulletin, Issue 15, MIX, Washington, August 2007, p. 48 The village bank itself will usually mark up this rate when it on-lends to individual members. While these rates seem high, they are low compared to those charged by local moneylenders in most countries. Unlike rural banks and credit unions these microfinance institutions do not provide savings services directly to their clients. The capital for the loans is provided by FINCA with on-time weekly installment repayments collectively guaranteed by all members‚Äîi.e., a shortfall by one member must be covered by other group members. This joint liability form of microcredit is controversial, with Muhammad Yunus (for example) rejecting formal systems of joint liability in Grameen Bank's solidarity groups. FINCA Worldwide FINCA‚Äôs 20 affiliates have a mostly-local staff of over 10,000 people, including credit officers and supervisors. Each credit officer attends the weekly meeting of each of her 10-15 village banks to coach its leadership committee and monitor the bank‚Äôs activities. In addition to motivation and adult education, the credit officer supervises client attendance, monitors bookkeeping accuracy, checks the accuracy of the current week‚Äôs loan and savings collections, and checks when the deposit receipt of the previous meeting. In turn, each village bank is managed by its elected officers‚Äîa president (who leads the bank‚Äôs democratic decision-making process), secretary (who takes attendance and keeps minutes) and a treasurer (responsible for accurately handling all cash transactions). Finally, each village banker has her own passbook, and her recorded balances of loan payments and savings deposits must always be the same as those recorded in the treasurer‚Äôs record for each client.

It is a major tributary of the river Reno. In Roman times, it was known as the Vatrenus (small Renus), although, in the Tabula Peutingeriana, it was already identified as the Santernus. It rises near the Futa Pass, at of elevation, in the Apennine ridges facing the plateau of Firenzuola in the Metropolitan City of Florence. Beyond Firenzuola, it flows northeast through the province of Bologna near Castel del Rio, where it is crossed by a famous medieval bridge, the Ponte degli Alidosi. It then flows past Fontanelice, Borgo Tossignano, Casalfiumanese, and, once in the Pianura Padana (the Po River's valley), Imola. The river forms the border between the province of Bologna and the province of Ravenna for a distance before entering the province of Ravenna. It then empties into the Reno near Argenta. It is probable that, in ancient times, the river flowed eastward from Bagnacavallo, as confirmed be the existence of a frazione of Ravenna called Santerno. In those days, after Imola, the river divided into two branches, one moving northeast toward Ravenna, the other continuing northward to join the Po. The Ravenna branch disappeared, most likely in the eighth century. Once the late course of the river was modified, and protective measures were taken in the 1880s, the Santerno was famous for its serious floods. Fourteen were recorded between 1679 and 1778.

He is the founder of FINCA International and the Rural Development Services (RDS), and is famous for innovating village banking, arguably the world‚Äôs most widely imitated microfinance methodology. Childhood and Family Hatch was born in 1940 in Pullman, Washington. His father, a college professor, could trace his ancestors back 14 generations to the first Pilgrim baby born in the New World. His mother, born in Costa Rica, had ancestors which included an authentic conquistador, a railway-builder, and a co-founder of Pan American World Airlines Education and early career After high school in Massachusetts and a BA in History from Johns Hopkins University, in July 1962 Hatch joined the Peace Corps for a 2-year tour of duty in Colombia. Trained as a \\"community development\\" volunteer, he was assigned to a semi-urban barrio known as Hoyo Sapo (\\"Frog Hole\\") on the outskirts of Medell√≠n. There, he helped organize the community to construct sewer lines, streets, a community center, library, soccer field, and a footbridge. It was also in Medellin that he became fluent in Spanish, embraced Latin culture, and was first exposed to severe poverty, infant malnutrition, and illiteracy. Little did he realize at the time that he had just embarked on a career of service to the world's poorest families that would continue uninterrupted for the next four decades of his life. Following his duty tour in Colombia he briefly served as an instructor in two Peace Corps training programs. Then, in early 1965 he was recruited as a regional Peace Corps director for Peru. Over the next 30 months he supervised some 55 volunteers working in agricultural cooperatives and credit unions serving the poorest. He returned home for graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, obtaining an MA in Economic History (1970) and a PhD in Economic Development (1973). In between (1970‚Äì71) a Fulbright grant allowed him to spend two crop cycles as a hired labor to 30 peasant farmers in Peru, documenting the power and wisdom of their traditional farming practices. The experience taught him deep respect for the subsistence skills of the poor. For the next 12 years he worked as a consultant in the design, management, and evaluation of mostly agricultural projects seeking to benefit the poor, eventually completing over 55 assignments in 28 countries of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Sadly, he found himself documenting dozens of foreign assistance failures that came closer to destroying than assisting their intended beneficiaries. He longed to create an organization that would allow the poor themselves-not bureaucrats, consultants, or other outsiders-to manage their own development initiatives. Founding FINCA In 1984, Hatch finally created his own nonprofit agency-the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA). He was inspired with the idea of FINCA while in an airplane high above the Andes, en route to a consultant assignment in Bolivia. He grabbed in-flight cocktail napkins, scraps of paper, and a pen and began writing down ideas, equations, and flow charts as fast as he could. By the time he landed in La Paz, he had the outline of a radically different approach to poverty alleviation: a financial services program that put the poor in charge. ‚ÄúGive poor communities the opportunity, and then get out of the way!‚Äù he said. The means to achieving this purpose were \\"village banks\\", a self- managed support group of some 25 borrower-owners. Its purpose was to provide the poorest families, particularly those headed by single-mothers, with loans to finance self-employment activities capable of generating additional household income. The story of FINCA-which has been called a \\"World Bank for the Poor\\" and a \\"poverty vaccine for the planet\\"-is quite remarkable and even miraculous. FINCA currently operates village banking programs in 23 countries and since 1984 it has assisted over 1,000,000families, lending over $360 million (in 2007) to the world's poorest families with a repayment rate of 98%, while also generating enough income to completely cover the operating costs of the field programs themselves. Moreover, there are now over 800 village banking programs worldwide in 60 countries created by about 30 other nonprofit agencies. Retirement In 2006, Hatch announced his retirement from day-to-day operations at FINCA headquarters in Washington, DC, although he continues to support FINCA in his capacity as a board member, fundraiser, and guest lecturer at universities. He currently lives with his wife Marguerite in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he is pursuing a lifelong interest in watercoloring and screen writing. He is also co-founder of a new nonprofit‚Äîthe Alliance of Students Against Poverty (ASAP)--which has a goal of ending global poverty by getting two million Americans to pledge \\"$1/day for those living on less than $1/day, thus raising $10 billion by the year 2025 to be distributed to those microfinance agencies with the best track record of serving the \\"poorest of the poor\\". On June 26, 2009, Hatch was presented with the Sargent Shriver Award for Distinguished Humanitarian Service by the National Peace Corps Association. Quotes \\"Of course, our work is far from done. Yet considering current growth trends, I know that by the time I retire over 200 million households worldwide will have been benefited by the poverty vaccine of microfinance and/or village banking .

It is Slovenia's only stock exchange. The exchange trades shares of Slovenian companies, as well as bonds and commercial papers. The only stockholder of the Ljubljana Stock Exchange is Zagreb Stock Exchange. The core business of the Ljubljana stock exchange is to ensure a secure, efficient and successful operation of the regulated segment of the Slovene capital market, in accordance with the law and other regulations. LJSE performs the following business activities: * operates the stock exchange market in financial instruments, for which it had obtained authorization from the Agency, * provides the prices of financial instruments, * provides information on supply and demand, market values and other data on financial instruments, * provides technical services to support trading, * operates a CSI. Additional activities include the services for trading members and listed companies. History The existing Ljubljana Stock Exchange was established in 1989. However, brokerage in Slovenia has a much longer tradition: the first stock exchange in Ljubljana existed as early as in the period between 1924 and 1942. Unfortunately, during the Second World War the trading on the old exchange was suspended, and after the war also officially banned by a decree by the new communist regime which replaced monarchy in Yugoslavia. Slovenians were thus left without a stock exchange for almost half a century. Then in the 1989 the Ljubljana Stock Exchange was officially established. In the year 1993 LJSE introduced electronic trading on BTS - on complex Stock Exchange Information System three times a week, floor trading still remained on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The new system of electronic information dissemination - SEOnet was launched in year 2002. Three years later LJSE introduced the elite segment of the official market, listing Slovenia's prime companies, and named it Prime Market. In the middle of the year 2008 the first regional road-show of SE Europe, organized by all 8 exchanges from the region, was held in Zagreb. In the same year Vienna Stock Exchange became the new majority owner of the LJSE (it acquired an 83.34% share). Year 2009 was crucial for establishment of \\"CEE Stock Exchange Group\\" (CEESEG), which at the time comprised the Vienna Stock Exchange and the stock exchanges of Budapest, Ljubljana and Prague. In the year 2010 there were a lot of important events: The SBITOP Index as the first genuine LJSE blue-chip index became a benchmark index, LJSE launched INFO HRAMBA - the new information system for the central storage of regulated information of all issuers on the LJSE, LJSE published the Slovene Capital Market Development Strategy, which had been prepared in cooperation with the capital market participants and was the answer to the changed economic and financial circumstances in the previous two years, LJSE proposed the introduction of 'P accounts' in the third pension pillar, LJSE started trading on the international trading system Xetra¬Æ and thus became integrated into the international capital market. As of July 2015 Ljubljana Stock Exchange is owned by Zagreb Stock Exchange. On 22 February 2016, the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, along with the Belgrade Stock Exchange, decided to join SEE Link, and EBRD-sponsored regional network for trading securities. Trading Trading on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange operates through an electronic order book in the Xetra¬Æ trading system. Xetra¬Æ trading system was implemented at the Ljubljana Stock Exchange on December 6, 2010. The Slovene capital market is now more easily accessible, internationally comparable and competitive market. The exchange has pre-market sessions from 08:00am to 09:30am and normal trading sessions from 09:30am to 01:00pm on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance. On the basis of meeting the LJSE liquidity criteria, securities are traded in the continuous or auction trading methods. The two trading methods ensure greater market integrity, improve best-price-forming mechanisms, and enable the Exchange and its members to set up internal controls and thus help identify potential cases of market manipulation. Stock indices SBI TOP is the first genuine LJSE blue-chip index and serves as the Slovene capital market benchmark index. It measures the performance of the most liquid and highly capitalized stocks on the LJSE Market. It is designed as a tradable index. Due to the liquidity of the constituents, it is intended to serve as underlying for index-linked financial instruments.

Initially started as a small group, it grew to become one of the country's largest animal welfare organizations, running active animal welfare, animal rights and humane education programmes. It was registered as a society under the Societies Act in 1964. The AWBI granted recognition in 1966. In 1964, soon after its inception, BCI suggested the city's corporation, which had been catching and killing street dogs since 1860 (to control its population and control rabies deaths in humans), an alternate method of capturing street dogs, neutering them and administering anti-rabies vaccine before discharging them to their original location, which would both control the population and help reduce and eventually prevent human deaths due to rabies. However, as the corporation did not heed this advice, BCI started working on this programme on its own. BCI began to rescue, spay and vaccinate street dogs and also persuaded pet owners and people taking care of street dogs to bring them for treatment free of cost. By the early 1970s, the number of stray dogs killed by the corporation was so high that the Central Leather Research Institute started designing products such as neckties and wallets from dog skins. By 1996, as many as 135 dogs were killed each day by the corporation, which employed various methods including administering a saturated solution of magnesium chloride directly into their hearts, poisoning, electrocuting, clubbing to death and burying alive in pits covered with bleaching powder and pesticides. In 1995, the then Corporation Commissioner S. Abul Hassan agreed to let BCI carry out an Animal Birth Control-Anti-Rabies (ABC-AR) programme in South Madras with the rider that the Commissioner would personally monitor the process and results. In 1995, even as BCI started the ABC-AR programme in South Chennai, street dogs in other parts of the city were still caught and killed. Soon, as the ABC-AR method started yielding visible results, the corporation agreed to relinquish its catch-and-kill policy and implement ABC-AR throughout the city, starting September 1996, marking the beginning of the ABC-AR programme in India. The number of human deaths in Chennai due to rabies dropped from 120 in 1996 to zero in 2007 and in 2010 the Corporation of Chennai declared Chennai to be rabies-free. However, there were a few deaths after the Chennai Corporation limits were greatly increased a few years later owing to less rigorous implementation of the ABC-AR programme in the suburbs and not abiding by the PCA Act (1960) and the Dog Rule Act (2001). Soon the corporations in other cities in India and around the world invited the then Chairman of the BCI, Chinny Krishna, to share the expertise in international conferences in Bratislava, Cairo, Sofia, Orlando, Hong Kong, Manila, Colombo, Riga, Amman, Singapore, Bali and Chengdu and to initiate the ABC-AR programmes in their cities. In May 2013, the government of the Republic of Mauritius, which had been using catch-and-kill as the only method to control the number of stray dogs, solicited the assistance of BCI to introduce ABC-AR programme in Mauritius. Unfortunately, the Mauritius government did not go ahead with the programme. Facilities=Geriatric Ward In January 2019, BCI opened a geriatric ward for ageing stray dogs at a cost of 1 million. The ward, with marble flooring to guard against ticks and insects and a heat-proof roofing, is spread over 3,600 square feet, with open space, two kennels for physically challenged animals, one kennel for visually impaired dogs, and an intensive care shed and a room for storing medicines. The kennels has a capacity to accommodate 30 animals. Functions The Blue Cross was affiliated to the RSPCA and WSPA. For the past few years, it has been working with Four Paws of Austria in disaster management and rabies control. The administration and non- medical activities of the organisation are almost entirely looked after by voluntary members in order to ensure that all monies received by the society are used primarily for animal welfare activities. Locations The registered office is in Chennai, located at Eldams Road in Alwarpet, along with other outreach sites‚Äîsuch as hospitals, shelters, ambulance services and animal birth control (ABC) centers‚Äîin the city and in Pondicherry. The main hospital and shelter facilities with ABC centres are located at Guindy and Kunnam in Kanchipuram district. It also has ABC centers in] at Toducadu in Thiruvallur district and in Pondicherry.

Aviary clinic On 13 January 2013, the Blue Cross of India, along with a student's group known as 'spaaak' opened an aviary clinic at the Chennai centre to treat ailing birds. This is the city's first aviary clinic. The clinic was started with an investment of 800,000 collected by means of donations. Awards In 1963, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals awarded Sundaram the Queen Victoria Medal. In 1964, Sundaram was awarded the Madras SPCA's silver medal and in 1991, the Watumall Foundation of Hawaii bestowed their award for his animal welfare activities. The Mylapore Academy and many others honoured him. The Government of India conferred their Prani Mitra award on him in 1997. Dr. S. Chinny Krishna has been awarded the Jeev Daya Puraskar by the Government of India, the Venu Menon Life Time achievement award, the Elizabeth Lleyt Award of the North Shore Animal League, The Middle East Network for Animal Welfare's Lifetime Achievement Award, The Jeanne Marching Award, and many others including the Kanuna Award. The Blue Cross has received the Proggy Award from PETA for its most innovative and interactive computer programmes which serve as an alternate to dissection of animals, the Bhagavan Mahaveer Ahimsa Foundation Award; and the Hastimull Award.

His works on monasticism in England from the times of Dunstan (909‚Äì988) to the dissolution of the monasteries are considered authoritative. Biography Born Michael Clive Knowles on 29 September 1896 in Studley, Warwickshire, England, Knowles was educated at Downside School, operated by the monks of Downside Abbey, and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he took a first in both philosophy and classics. Monk In 1923 Knowles became a member of the monastic community at Downside, being given the religious name of David, by which he was always known thereafter. After completing the novitiate he was sent by the abbot to the Pontifical Athenaeum of St. Anselm in Rome for his theological studies. Returning to Downside, he was ordained a priest. His research into the early monastic history of England was assisted by the library built up at Downside by Dom Raymund Webster. Knowles became the leader of a faction of the younger monks of the abbey who wanted to resist the growing demands of the school on the pattern of monastic life at the abbey. They advocated a more contemplative life as the goal of their lives as monks. This effort led to a period of major conflict within the community and he was transferred to Ealing Abbey, another teaching establishment. Academic at Cambridge In 1944 Knowles was elected into a research fellowship in medieval studies at Peterhouse in the University of Cambridge, where he would remain for the duration of his academic career. In 1947 he was appointed as Professor of Medieval History and then, in 1954, he became the Regius Professor of Modern History, a post he held until his retirement in 1963. He served as president of the Royal Historical Society from 1957 to 1961; and was the first President of the Ecclesiastical History Society (1961‚Äì63). While pursuing his academic life at Cambridge, Knowles was eventually, at the instigation of Abbot Christopher Butler, exclaustrated from Downside Abbey and finally released from his vows. Before his death on 21 November 1974 from a heart attack,Obituary in The Times, 26 November 1974. however, he was readmitted to the order. Knowles is best known for his history of early English monasticism, The Monastic Order in England: A History of Its Development from the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council, 940‚Äì1216 (1940). His three-volume work, The Religious Orders in England (1948‚Äì1959), is also highly regarded by scholars in English medieval ecclesiastical history.Review by V. H. Galbraith . In 1962 he published a textbook, The Evolution of Medieval Thought (2nd ed. 1988), that \\"dominated medieval history courses in U.S. colleges for a quarter of a century\\". He has been criticised for excluding nunneries from consideration in Medieval Religious Houses on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to draw on (a lack remedied in more recent scholarship)..

It was developed by Magic Wand Productions and released on October 25, 2005. The game was published by Activision in conjunction with hunting supply company Cabela's. Gameplay Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2006 Trophy Season is a story-driven, linear hunting game. The player must trek through various North American landscapes and claim every trophy in the region. The player starts at the first lodge, where they must buy their initial equipment, weapons, and clothing, sight their firearm, and obtain tags. The player must visit the warden of each lodge in order to obtain tags for the region. Throughout the game, the player will encounter random events, side quests, and hunting tournaments. Primary objectives must be completed before exiting a location, while secondary objectives are optional. Objectives can be failed but the career's completion is not contingent on them. Game mammals are represented by red markers, similar to its predecessor Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2005 Adventures. Red markers indicate live game, blue markers indicate dead game, and purple markers indicate wounded or special game. Non-game mammals and some female s of some species - elk, moose, and deer - are unmarked. Tags cannot be obtained for these animals and the player cannot hunt them. Non-game mammals include foxes and rabbits. The player can only hunt mammals for which they have tags, and in their respective quantities. All tags are provided by the warden for each location and cannot be changed, removed, or sold. The objectives for each location mandate that the player obtain at least one of each animal, while the player will often be provided two tags for many species. When the player zooms in on a mammal with a scope, text will appear at the bottom of the scope, showing the animal's species, sex, scoring, and immediate distance from the player. This is helpful in hunting tournaments, as many require the player to claim an animal within a certain distance or by best score. The animal statistics provided by the scope will change as the player mouses over different targets. Non-game animals can also provide statistics if the player mouses over them while scoped over them. The player cannot hunt animals for which they do not have tags, including non- game mammals. The player cannot hunt animals with their vehicle. The player cannot drive into an NPC. The player cannot fire their weapon between 6:00pm and 8:00am. The player cannot fire their weapon within 50 yards of an inhabited building. Violating these results in warnings. The player has a maximum of three warnings before they are asked to leave the area, from which they can either restart the location or abort to the main menu. Story Upon starting a career hunt, a text box will appear describing the player as the grandson of a hunting legend named Pete. The player accompanied Pete on the hunting trails when he was younger. Pete aspired to bag all species across the trails - 65 in all - hoping to earn a spot in the Hunter's Hall of Fame. However, on one of the last hunts, he slipped on an icy slope and hurt his leg, preventing him from finishing the hunt. The player's incentive to crossing the regions and finishing the hunts is to win his grandfather the plaque. The story is largely absent from the game, but NPCs across the regions will recognize the player as Pete's grandson, or hint that they have not seen the player in a long time. The NPCs have no long-term impact on the story and remain largely irrelevant in the overall gameplay. Locations Each hunting area is dedicated to specific game. Occasionally, an area will have more than one type of game existing in the area. An area's boundaries, borders, topography, and features are different each time. There are usually three or four areas between lodges. When the player fills their objectives, there is no longer a reason for them to stay in that area. Each map has a camp area, marked by a purple tent icon on the map. The player can rest here and talk to game wardens about hunting tournaments happening in the area. The player may only set up their tents in designated camping areas, a major departure from the previous two installments. Some areas will have special events. Hunting tournaments, wounded or sick game in the field, lost or injured NPCs, or harsh weather that will require the player to take shelter. Some maps have points that are only accessible by climbing, in which the player will have to abandon their vehicle. Some maps will feature NCPs that inform the player of good- scoring trophies and are listed as secondary objectives. Most side quests and notifications will come to the player in the form of an email. An alert noise will play and text will appear, prompting the player to press a hotkey to listen to the email. The text will be narrated and the player's objectives will be updated. A few locations have separate areas that are privately-owned lands. They are marked with yellow arrows on the map. The player is often invited to those lands, on which vehicles are often prohibited. The owners of the land will offer the player money to hunt varmints - usually coyotes or wolves - on their property. At the end of every region, the player will enter a new area for which they were not given tags at the lodge. They will talk to the region warden about possibly entering the hunting tournament. Whether they play the tournament or not, the player's main primary objective is to continue to the next region. Maps The maps are more difficult to read in this game than in the previous two installments. Trails and paths are present in some locations but are never displayed on the player's map. Maps show topography of the entire location, but it can still be difficult to figure out the correct path to the next location. Some locations require the player to pass through canyons, gorges, rivers, and caves. Green arrows represent the next location the player must enter. The red arrow indicates the location the player just left. Yellow arrows appear on some locations, denoting private land onto which the player is invited after triggering the special event. Designated camping areas are represented by purple tents. Bridges are represented by light-blue bridge icons. The player's vehicle is presented by a crude light-blue image of a car. It will only appear if the player has disembarked the vehicle. The player's boat is represented by a green, crude sailboat icon. Climbing points are represented by a yellow staircase. Any injured or stranded hunters, shelters, or special event sites are marked with a red X. Any cabins on the map are represented by an orange house icon. Hunting Tournaments Hunting tournaments are regular events that take place throughout the maps. The player will usually be briefed about the tournament before entering the area. Wardens can be found at the designated camp site for each area. Tournament registration is from 8:00am-12:00pm, so the player must sleep to those times if they wish to register. The player will always compete against an NPC, who can be seen running through the field and hunting his or her game. Each tournament must be played using the firearm and equipment given. Some tournaments have additional rules and stipulations. Most tournaments require that the game must be claimed with a clean shot. If the player wounds the animal, they will have to restart the tournament if they wish to win. Some tournaments have distance requirements, usually within 100 yards or above 50 yards. Some trophies are simply a matter of best scoring. The player is not required to win or even compete in hunting tournaments to progress through the game. There is no achievement for 100% game completion. The only tournaments that impose a force on the player are tournaments held at the end of each region, in which the player must only talk to the warden about competing. The player will always have a choice to decline to participate or decline to restart if they fail or lose the hunt. A few tournaments are held at lodges. They are usually skeet shooting contests. The player can also win the firearm with which they won the contest in question. Upon winning a tournament, the player will be rewarded with the firearm with which they won said tournament. They will not have to purchase the gun, but only equip it at the next lodge. Lodges Unlike the previous two games, the player has no freedom of their advancement in the game. There is a set chain of locations that the player must complete in order to progress in the game. In each major region, there are small locations and landscapes the player must trek through and hunt. The player will begin in a region at a log cabin. At the cabin, the player will be given a set amount of tags for different species in the successive areas. The player can view hunting regulations and information about the region. At the cabin, weapons, clothing, tents, food, water, medical bags, decoys, calls, and lures can be purchased. Unlike the previous two Cabela's Big Game Hunter installments, the backpack capacity is on a weight basis. In the previous two games, the player had ten slots for ten different items, excluding clothing. In this game, the player has a weight limit that they can periodically increase throughout the hunt. Each items takes a different amount of weight. All items are equipped in the player's room. The player can also rest in their room at the lodge for however they long wish to advance time instantly and heal any wounds. At each cabin, the player can rent an ATV for $200. Later in the game, pickup trucks and SUVs are available for rental of $200. Boats make periodic appearances and do not have to be rented. The player will progress through each area, fulfilling their tags. The player manually enters each region by pressing a hotkey. When the player reaches a new lodge, they will not be able to go back through the previous maps. Each lodge features benches and picnic tables around the common area. Each lodge area has trails that allow the player to find the shooting range and the next hunting location.. The player is required to sight their firearms upon purchase. As they use the firearm, the weapon will gradually become less- properly sighted, especially if the player is consistently inaccurate. The player may only sight weapons at a target range at a lodge area. They must enter the sighting booth, where the scope of the firearm (if applicable) is removed and the player is fixed in a stance facing a target. The player uses the arrow keys to change the windage and elevation of the firearm until it is firing properly. Throughout the hunt, text will appear on the screen prompting the player to sight their gun or suggest that the gun might not be sighted properly. Quests and Side Missions Quests and side missions are events that always triggered at the same points of each location. They will often appear as secondary objectives, meaning the player does not have to complete them to progress to the next location. Since there is no achievement for 100% game completion, there is no further need to complete each objective. This is another massive departure from the previous two titles, wherein the player was the only person in each hunting field and they progressed at their own pace with no additional quests. The warden may notify the player via e-mail that there is a sick or wounded animal in the field and that they must be taken down. The animal in question will spawn on the map marked by a purple marker. The player will receive the bonus cash and clean shot bonus (if applicable) for bagging the trophy. The player may also be invited onto private land bordering certain maps by the game warden. These private lands are marked by yellow arrows and will have their own map when the player enters the land. Here, the player is usually required to hunt varmints - coyotes or wolves depending on the location - for a commission price - usually $1000. These targets are marked as game usually is. When the player has finished taking care of the trespassing animals, they will be sent back to the location through which they entered the land. Some hunters in the area might be injured or lost. In the forest location Hemlock Path, the player witnesses another hunter being mauled by a brown bear. They must notify the warden to save the hunter. On other maps, the player will be notified via e-mail that a hunter has injured themselves and must be rescued. There are no rewards for these missions. Stranded or injured hunters are marked by red X's on the map. Some locations are accessible by unconventional means. In the mountains locations Seven's Divide, the player is informed to go the cave in the east, as the normal trail to the next map is blocked. The player will enter the next region through that cave via waterfall. Game Mammals The player must progress through six regions: Forest, marsh, desert, grasslands, mountains, and tundra. The player can hunt almost 40 game mammals. They are: wolverine, Columbia black-tailed deer, bobcat, Roosevelt elk, cougar, brown bear, American black bear, timber wolf, whitetail, woodland caribou, grizzly, Eastern timber wolf, Northwestern moose, Tule elk, desert bighorn sheep, desert mule deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, javelina, Rocky Mountain elk, grey wolf, bison, Rocky Mountain bighorn, mountain caribou, Rocky Mountain mule deer, lynx, Shiras moose, mountain goat, stone sheep, musk ox, Dall sheep, polar bear, Yukon moose, Arctic wolf, barren-ground caribou, Kodiak brown bear, and Northern timber wolf The wolverine, lynx, Roosevelt elk, desert bighorn, javelina, bison, grey wolf, Rocky Mountain bighorn, Rocky Mountain mule deer, Shiras Moose, mountain goat, stone sheep, polar bear, Arctic wolf, timber wolf, Northern timber wolf, Yukon moose, and Kodiak brown bear all appear only once each in the game. All other mammals appear more than once throughout the series. The wolverine, Roosevelt Elk, bison, grey wolf, Rocky Mountain Bighorn, Rocky Mountain mule deer, Arctic wolf, timber wolf, northern timber wolf, eastern timber wolf, Yukon Moose, Kodiak brown bear, mountain caribou, Columbia black-tailed deer, bobcat, Northwestern moose, Tule elk, desert mule deer, and Rocky Mountain elk are species that appear in this game that did not appear in the previous two titles. The desert bighorn appeared in the 2004 Season, while not appearing any different than the standard version of the bighorn. The desert bighorn variant did not appear in the 2005 Adventures. The lynx appeared the previous two games but only as a non-game, unmarked animal. The wild boar, the Alaskan moose, the Canadian moose, the Sitka black-tailed deer, the Labrador caribou, and the Coues deer are the only species that appear in the previous two titles that do not appear in this one. Non-Game Animals Each level will contain several types of small, non-game mammals. The player cannot obtain tags for these animals. The player will receive warnings for shooting these animals. The non-game species changes based on region. The player will find rabbit, jackrabbit, porcupine, fox, and Arctic hare across their hunt. Deer does and elk and moose cows are unmarked and the player is not allowed to hunt them. Despite these animals not being legal game, the player's scope will still provide trophy information if the player mouses over them while scoped. HUD The Heads Up Display is must simpler than that of the previous two games. In the bottom-left corner of the screen there is a silhouette of a hunter outlined in green. The green outline will turn from green to red as more damage is dealt. The player takes damage from animal attacks, drowning, taking fall damage, and crashing their vehicle. The green colouring inside will lower as the player takes damage, but will gradually recharge. The health will recharge faster if the player drinks water or eats food. The player can heal by using a medical bag or sleeping. Next to the health bar is the energy bar, this time presented horizontally rather than vertically. The bar is blue and gradually decreases as the player expends energy. The bar will change colour from blue, to yellow, to white, to orange until it is depleted. The player must stop moving to replenish it. Above the energy bar is the stealth bar. This is a series of red ticks that rise and diminish based on the player's visibility and sound. When the player crouches, is still, or camouflages with the environment, the bar will rise In the top- left corner of the screen is the compass with a much simpler design than the previous two games. In the top-right corner of the screen is a red flag that indicates direction and intensity of the wind. In the bottom-right corner of the screen is the ammunition. Rifles, shotguns, handguns, and bows have different ammunition appearances. When the player expends rounds, they will disappear from the corner of the screen until there are none left. The player will automatically reload when they are out of ammunition. The player can reload at any time using the hotkey. Ammunition is unlimited and does not need to be purchased from a lodge.

Some of the graphics in this game are much smoother than its predecessors, but are slightly less realistic in terms of the overall design and appeal. The animal movement is also very machine-like and not as smooth as the animals from the previous titles. Voice Acting The only voice-overs in the previous two titles came in the form a warden (who's gender and accent were determined by the location) when the player violated hunting area rules. No NPCs were actually visible. In this game, however, multiple NPCs can be seen throughout all regions, some of whom do not speak. The same voices are recycled between several characters, and only basic gesturing animations accompany the mediocre voice acting. NPCs do not interact with the environment other than when prompted. The only time an NPC is seen interacting is when they are participating in a hunting tournament. NPCs stay in the same spot, usually cycling between sitting and standing. At camping areas when a player sleep, NPCs will not go in their tents. They will stand outside all night while the player sleeps. Major Differences From Past Two Installments The previous two installments were Cabela's Big Game Hunter: 2004 Season and Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2005 Adventures on PC. Both games operated very similarly, with some minor cosmetic and difficulty changes separating those two games. *In the 2006 Trophy Season, the player must physically progress through each location to unlock the next. Whereas in the previous two titles, the player equips for each season, bags the trophies for each season, and then chooses which location to unlock next until all are completed. The player must progress through each location and lodge linearly in order to complete the career. The player cannot backtrack to choose a different point from which to continue their career. *2006 Trophy Season features special events and tournaments, whereas the previous games did not. NPCs and voice-overs are also present in the game, whereas in the previous games, the player was the only visible character. The only narration in those games were those of the wardens reprimanding the player upon breaking hunting regulations. *This game requires the player to sight their weapons at designated sighting booths. The previous two games did not require the player to sight their weapons but sighting was possible in the target range. *This game features more species and subspecies compared to the other two titles. All mammals from the previous games appear in this game. *The maps in the previous two games show trails, while this game's maps show no trails or paths. *In this game, the player must sleep at designated hunting areas. In the previous two titles, the player can pitch a tent wherever they want, as long as it is an area of flat, open ground. *In this game, the player must rent vehicles at each lodge for $200. The player did not rent vehicles in the previous two titles, rather than spawned within immediate distance of them. *In this game, moose and musk ox are hostile. In the other games, they would not attack the player. *The player cannot swim in this game. In the other games, swimming was frequently necessary. *There are no weapons restrictions to this game by location, but rather by tournament, which are optional. The 2004 Season featured no weapons restrictions based on season. The 2005 featured firearm restrictions for each season and location. *The three stealth bars from the previous titles are compiled into one bar in this game. *Screaming and moaning can be heard when the player takes damage. Panting can heard when the player depletes their energy bar. *There was no fall damage in the previous title. Fall damage is a constant presence in this game. *In the previous titles, if the player drove their vehicle into water, it could not be retrieved. In this game, the player can pay $200 for their vehicle to be retrieved from the water. *Animals did not make noise upon being shot and killed in the last two games. Animals make noise every time they are killed in this game. The animals also spasm with a rag doll effect upon death, whereas in the last game they did not. *A separate window appeared in the last two games when tracking an animal. In this game, text appears on the bottom of the screen with the tracking information. *Players are rewarded with a $100 clean shot bonus in the last two games, while in this game they are rewarded with a $200 clean shot bonus. *In the last two games, the player can choose a specific location to hunt, either a US State, Canadian province, Canadian territory, or Mexican state. In this game, the regions are incredibly vague. However, some locations and lodge names are based on real life region, territory, and county names relative to location. *Players could not enter lodges in the last two games. Entering lodges is the focal point of completing this game. *In the last two games, players could carry up to four instances each of food packets, hydration bladders, scent covers, and medical kits. In this game, only two water bags and food packs each may be carried, as well as only one medical kit at a time. The player can also carry only one firearm, where the limit in the last two games was two weapons per hunt. In this game, the player can only carry either the tripod or tree stand at once. In the last game, they could be carried together. *In the last two games, red and blue dots indicated game location and life status. In this game, they are represented by blue, red, and purple triangle markers. Purple markers indicate wounded or special game. In the last two games, if a player wounded an animal, the dot would stay red and the player would have to track it. *In the last two games, the player's available tags would be indicated in the top-right corner of the screen. A tag would blink if the corresponding mammal is wounded or dead and must be claimed. Tags are not on display in this game, but rather in a separate page of the player's inventory. *In the previous two titles, the inventory could be accessed while the player was in a tent or vehicle. In this game, the inventory can only be accessed while standing on the ground. *In the last two games, when the player pitched a tent, there would be no other text on the screen, other than that in the lower-right corner, prompting the player can use a set hotkey to wake up. In this game, the clock is shown above the tent as the player sleeps. *In the last two games, the only interfaces were the inventory and the main menu. In this game, the player can press the designated hotkey - default \\"F\\" - to show the map. Different tabs at the top of the interface allow the player to view their objectives and the completion of said objectives, the logbook - showing the advances the player has made and the times at which they were made - and the player's stats and cash status. Notable Features *This is the first Cabela's game to feature wolverine, bison, bobcat, and several other species, as well as subspecies of previous game mammals, such as Rocky Mountain Elk, Rocky Mountain Mule Deer, Desert Mule Deer, Kodiak Bear, Tule Elk, and others. *The game recycles several sounds and visuals from the previous game. The sound when the player draws a weapon is the same from the previous two games. Certain animals calls and sounds, the sounds of the boat and pickup truck, as well some ambient environment sounds are from the previous two games. The crosshair is the same from the previous two titles. *The player must rent ATVs, trucks, cars, and snowmobiles for $200 at the start of each region. Not renting the vehicle, losing or damaging it during a hunt, or abandoning it during a hunt will force the player to progress to the next level without it. The previous titles did not require the player to rent the vehicles for their location. Rather, the player spawned next to it and could only loose it if they drove it into deep water. *Unlike the previous games, the player can go into buildings in the areas, most of which are cabins they are required to enter in order to purchase tags and equipment to progress. *The player cannot swim in this game. *The player can only sleep in cabins (where they can choose for how long they sleep) and designated camping spots on the map. *Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2005 Adventures for consoles is exactly the same game as the 2006 Trophy Season for PC. The PC version of the 2005 Adventures is not available on consoles.

The school served the Lordshill community from 1983 to 2008 for 11 to 16-year-olds. In its later years during 2005 and 2008 it became a specialist Arts College. The most recent Ofsted inspection was 27 September 2004, when the school was praised, the introduction to the report reading \\"Oaklands Community School is a very good school. Its exceptional egalitarian ethos ensures that all students are treated with care, respect and encouragement. Very strong leadership, a commitment to equality of opportunity, improvement and raised standards combined with a good quality of education for all students result in a school which provides good value for money.\\"Ofsted inspection report, visit of 27‚Äì30 September 2004 Ofsted Website According to the Department of Education performance tables, the school obtained the fourth-highest CVA score in the city. This is a new, complex Key Stage 2 to Key Stage 4 contextual value added (CVA) score designed to show the progress children have made. This is done by comparing their achievements with those of other pupils nationally who had the same or similar prior attainment in their test results at age 10 or 11 in 2001.Department of Education performance tables 2006 History The school was built on a seven-acre site, with a mixture of English tithe barn, with strong Japanese influences. The original cost in 1980 was thought to be ¬£1.2 million, however this doubled to ¬£2.4 million. The school opened in September 1982, though it was officially opened by Anne, Princess Royal the following year on May 1983. The first year, the school saw 400 pupils enroll, with the capacity of the school being 720. The school closed in August 2008. The premises became the upper school site for Oasis Academy Lord's Hill which has since moved to a new dedicated building. At the same time Millbrook Community School became the lower school site. The school buildings have been demolished apart from the pool and community hall. The land now has planning permission for 103 new homes. The swimming pool was closed in July 2012 after a leak was found. The Labour council leaders consulted over whether or not it would be economically viable to get it repaired at a cost of ¬£500,000. On 14 February 2014, the work needed to repair and reopen Oaklands swimming pool was approved at a cost of ¬£1.7 million funded by Southampton City Council. The pool was reopened in January 2015. Dr. Peter Hollis was the longest running head teacher at Oaklands Community School starting in September 1982, after transferring from Shirley Warren Secondary School until he retired in August 2006. Mrs Sarah Howelles took over until the school closed in 2008.

President Bush appointed Herman to his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, serving on subcommittees which advised the President on nanotechnology, networking and information technology and university-private sector partnerships. He co-chaired the High Performance Computing Inititiative for the Council on Competitiveness as well as serving on the steering committee for its Energy, Security, Innovation and Sustainability Initiative and the Council‚Äôs Executive Committee. Herman served as chair of the Council of Presidents for the University Research Association in 2007. He also served on, and was chair of, the National Science Foundation's Advisory Committee. Herman's research specializes on mathematical physics and operator algebras. Early life Herman was raised in his grandfather's house in Brooklyn. He attended Stevens Institute of Technology where he received a B.S. in mathematics in 1963. He later received his Ph.D. in mathematics from University of Maryland, College Park, in 1967. After graduating from Maryland, Herman taught mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1968 to 1972. He moved to Pennsylvania State University in 1972 and later served as chairman of the Mathematics Department from 1986 to 1990. In 1990, he returned to University of Maryland in College Park to serve as dean until 1998. Honors Herman is an Eagle Scout and a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

Herman received the Malone Award from APLU in 2009.http://www.aplu.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=1277 Admissions Controversy The Chicago Tribune reported on Friday, May 29, 2009 that several students had been admitted to the University based upon connections or recommendations by Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the Rod Blagojevich administration. The improprieties occurred, according to the Tribune, on the Urbana-Champaign campus headed by Herman. The Tribune obtained through a FOIA request several emails between Herman, then law dean Heidi Hurd and others spanning a number of years and establishing without any doubt that preferential treatment had been given to well-connected students. The Tribune also reported on one case in which the University's president, B. Joseph White, had received a recommendation for a relative of the (subsequently convicted) fundraiser Tony Rezko to be admitted. The Tribune posted emails of Herman to admissions staff pushing for less qualified students to be accepted, citing particularly an exchange between Herman, admissions officers, and then- dean of the college of law Heidi Hurd. The controversy has sparked condemnation from student trustee Paul Schmitt and state lawmakers. It is quite unusual for deans, let alone provosts, to interfere with admissions staff in deciding whether or not to admit individual applicants. Their usual role is to provide guidance and direction as to admissions policies. As a result of the \\"clout controversy,\\" several state lawmakers including Representatives, Naomi Jakobsson, Chapin Rose, and Bill Black have called for legislative investigations. Chairman of the Illinois House of Higher Education Committee, Representative Mike Boland, has called for Herman's and White's removal, as well as several administrators including and members of the Board of Trustees, saying \\"They were trusted to protect our university. In my eyes, they failed in that regard and they should resign.\\"http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/06/university-of-illinois- boland-white.html In September 2009, Urbana alumni in the Chicago area wrote to the governor and board of trustees praising Herman for his many accomplishments during his term as Chancellor. These included highlighting his fundraising leadership and efforts to raise the campus' share of the Brilliant Futures $2.25 billion campaign, his efforts to increase Urbana's research presence including leading in creating the Energy Biosciences Institute, a $500 million research program to study converting plant biomass to fuel, helping to create an outreach effort with Chicago Public Schools to increase recruitment of students and increasing diversity on campus, among other accomplishments. After months of calls for his resignation, on 20 October 2009 Herman announced he would resign as Chancellor for his role in the controversy.

Lingula lives in burrows in barren sandy coastal seafloor and feeds by filtering detritus from the water. It can be detected by a short row of three openings through which it takes in water (sides) and expels it again (middle).  Anatomy and morphology = Shell  A shell encloses the organs and other internal parts of the body, except for a long, fleshy stalk (or pedicle) that extends from the tail (or posterior) end of the shell. This shell has two nearly identical tan or bronze valves, that are often tinged greenish or bluegreenish. These are held together by muscles between them. The valves are secreted by two mantle folds, one on the dorsal and one on the ventral side of the body. The valves are composed of chitin, protein, and calcium phosphate and consist of about 50% organic material. The outer surface is covered by a thin glossy layer of protein called periostracum. The high organic content of the shell makes it somewhat soft and flexible. These valves are located on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the animal. The front (or anterior) end of the shell has a squared off (or truncate) shape and the rear end tapers to a point where the stalk emerges. This point (called apex) is the earliest part of the valve. The shell of the young animal roughly remains the same, adding much material at the front and less at the sides. Many growth lines are visible, parallel to the margins of the shell. The valves widen slightly at the front end, forming a narrow opening (or gape), through which water is pumped in at the sides and out from the middle. The ventral valve is slightly longer and slightly more convex. The margin of the valves is fringed by chitinous tan colored bristle (or chaetae), short at the side of the valves, but much longer at the front where they assist in keeping open the access of the body cavity to the outside water. In death, the gape is closed and the bristles may be absent or short as they become brittle and darker in color when dry.  Stalk  The stalk (or pedicle) is a long white extension of the body, that emerges at the apex from between the valves, and not, as in articulate brachiopods, from a special opening in the dorsal valve. At the rear end, that is deepest in the sea bed, the skin (or epithelium) secretes a glue-like mucus that binds to the substrate's particles, thus temporarily anchoring the animal. The very thick skin (cuticle) is not composed of cells, and is opaque, being secreted by a very thin white epidermis, which is attached by a very thin layer of connective tissue to the white muscle inside. The muscle fibres are attached to the connective tissue and are wound like helixes. In the centre of the muscle runs an inconspicuous tube-shaped opening along the entire length, which is an extension of, and in open connection with, the body cavity within the shell. It is lined by a layer of one cell thick mesothelium.  Internal organs  Ovaries have a fine texture and a tan to orange color. Male gonads are coarse-grained and creamy white.  Reproduction  Species such as Lingula anatina have a breeding season that extends from summer to fall and breed annually. Their larvae are planktonic.  Living fossil  Lingula has long been considered an example of a living fossil; in fact, the perceived longevity of this genus led Darwin to coin this concept. This living fossil status is now considered unjustified. This status is based on the shape of the shell only, and it has been shown that this shape corresponds to a burrowing lifestyle, occurring in different brachiopod lineages, with different and evolving internal structures.  Taxonomy  The genus Lingula was created in 1791 by Jean Guillaume Brugui√®re. George Shaw describe Mytilus rostrum in 1798, but this species was later assigned to Lingula. In 1801 Jean-Baptiste Lamarck described L. anatina, its type species.  Possible etymologies  Lingula is probably derived from the Latin word for tongue \\"lingua\\" and a diminutive suffix -ula, so small tongue. Alternatively it may be derived from the Latin word for spoon (Lingula) directly. The origin of the epithet anatina is not known, but in Latin \\"anatina\\" means \\"belonging to the duck\\", possibly due to its resemblance to a duck bill. Another possible derivation could be from the French anatife ('goose barnacle'), for its likeness.  Reassigned species  The following species, previously assigned to Lingula are now considered better placed in other genera: * L. albida = Glottidia albida * L. alveolata = ‚Ä†Dignomia alveolata * L. attenuata = ‚Ä†Palaeoglossa attenuata * L. audebarti = Glottidia audebarti * L. criei = ‚Ä†Tomasina criei * L. davisii = ‚Ä†Lingulella davisii * L. imbituvensis = ‚Ä†Langella imbituvensis * L. lesueuri = ‚Ä†Ectenoglossa lesueuri * L. nebrascensis = ‚Ä†Trigonoglossa nebrascensis * L. pinnaformis = ‚Ä†Lingulepis pinnaformis * L. plumbea = ‚Ä†Monobilina plumbea * L. polita = ‚Ä†Dicellomus polita * L. semen = Glottidia semen * L. subspatulata = ‚Ä†Barroisella campbelli * L. williamsana = ‚Ä†Lingulipora williamsana  Extinct species  The following are extinct Lingula species.Emig C.

The cilia on the lophophore create a current through the mantle cavity, which ensures the supply of food particles and oxygen.

He considered it one of his best works, as did Italo Calvino, who wrote, \\"Vidal's development...along that line from Myra Breckinridge to Duluth, is crowned with great success, not only for the density of comic effects, each one filled with meaning, not only for the craftsmanship in construction, put together like a clock-work which fears no word processor, but because this latest book holds its own built-in theory, that which the author calls 'apr√®s post-structuralism'. I consider Vidal to be a master of that new form which is taking shape in world literature and which we may call the hyper-novel or the novel elevated to the square or the cube.\\" Plot summary One of the experimental texts Vidal refers to as his \\"inventions\\", Duluth describes both a novel written about Duluth (that, bordered on one side by Minneapolis and on the other by Michigan, bears scant resemblance to the real city) and a television series of the same name; when residents of the city die, they end up as characters in the TV show, who can in some cases continue interacting with the living through the TV screen. When members of the cast of Duluth, the TV show, die, they become characters in Rogue Duke, a romance novel serialized in the pages of Redbook, the popular women's magazine. The author of all three, Rosemary Klein Kantor, is herself a character in the book, making cameo appearances throughout. She generates texts with the aid of a computer, adding to its numerous geographical and historical errors her mangled clich√©s (\\"Bellamy Craig II plays hardball...in the fast lane!\\") and unusual grammatical constructions (\\"Her handcuffs now handcuffed her hands\\"). However, there is in the city of Duluth a mysterious cerise flying saucer whose insectoid alien inhabitants, after meddling in the spectacularly corrupt politics of the city, use an accidental tense shift to seize control of the computer, erasing the human race from the face of the earth and bringing the book to an end.

He is also known for playing for the technical death metal band Necrophagist from 2002 until 2006, appearing on their 2004 release Epitaph. As well as Necrophagist, M√ºnzner played in Defeated Sanity from 1999 to 2002 and Obscura from 2008 to 2014, after which he left to co- found the extreme progressive metal supergroup Alkaloid. He rejoined Obscura in 2020. In addition to being a prolific solo artist who has released three solo albums, M√ºnzner is also a member of Ron Jarzombek's musical venture Terrestrial Exiled and was featured on Hannes Grossmann's solo album. In recent years he has suffered from focal dystonia in his left hand. M√ºnzner is known for drawing huge influences from classical music, particularly Johann Sebastian Bach. Early life M√ºnzner began playing guitar aged 11, began playing his first live shows when he was just 12, and soon thereafter was introduced to the work of Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, Dream Theater, and Paul Gilbert. After seeing Gilbert perform, he developed a habit of practicing rigorously for 6‚Äì8 hours a day. In 2001 he attended the Munich Guitar Institute and studied with Wolfgang Zenk and Uli Wiedenhorn, before graduating in 2002. Influences and style His playing style is largely based on neo- classical scales, such as diminished, phrygian, harmonic minor. He cites many neoclassical guitar players as major influences, such as Tony MacAlpine, Jason Becker who inspired his sweep picking technique, Marty Friedman, Yngwie Malmsteen, Vinnie Moore, and John Petrucci, who also inspired his alternate picking technique.http://www.guitar9.com/interview163.html In regards to guitar technique, he says: > \\"Phrasing is what makes the big difference between just mindless noodling > and a great guitar solo in my opinion. Think more about which notes you play > and when you play them, and then just use your chops to play the notes you > wanna play. Don't think now I sweep, now I pick, now I tap, etc. Think of > musical phrases and use speed to add intensity. Intensity is essential for > good music in general to me.\\" He wrote half the leads on Necrophagist's Epitaph, although he believes that \\"his phrasing wasn't as good as now as I tended to overplay\\". He's also a fan of symmetric and exotic scales, and he openly endorses using his knowledge of music theory when writing: \\"It helps me a lot to see and navigate through the fret-board a lot faster. [...] I think knowing all the theory also made me learn every other aspect of guitar a lot faster.\\" http://musictheoryforguitar.com/musictheoryinterviewchristianmuenzner.html Music=Necrophagist M√ºnzner joined Necrophagist in 2002, and wrote the solos to the Epitaph album, including songs like \\"Stabwound\\" and the title track. The album garnered critical acclaim amongst fans and critics alike for the complexity of the music and its substantive neoclassical influences.http://www.allmusic.com/album/epitaph-mw0000150000 M√ºnzner's tenure at Necrophagist lasted only four years, and in 2006 he left the band. However, he later stated that there was a lot of tension within the band, \\"which sucked out the fun of guitar playing\\", which prompted him to leave.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHdSRzPiFtU In regards to his relationship with Muhammed and the contribution he made to the record, M√ºnzner states: > \\"I know nothing about what this guy is up to. Last time I spoke to him was > more than 5 and a half years ago. We met briefly at a festival where both > Necro and Obscura played 2 years ago, but we didn‚Äôt speak apart from a brief > hello. We didn‚Äôt really part ways on the best terms... It kinda pisses me > off though that so many people think that he wrote my leads on Epitaph, > which is just bullshit.\\" After leaving the band, Necrophagist announced that M√ºnzner's departure was due to scheduling conflicts. Obscura Shortly after leaving Necrophagist, M√ºnzner joined Steffen Kummerer, Jeroen Paul Thesseling and Hannes Grossmann in Obscura, recording his first album with them, Cosmogenesis, in 2009. Two years later, he recorded the third Obscura record, Omnivium, in 2011. Throughout his tenure, the band played more than 200 lives shows. M√ºnzner stated that a large reason for his departure from Necrophagist and eagerness to join Obscura was because of the freedom afforded to him by this band, particularly Steffen Kummerer who welcomed his contributions. When writing for Obscura, M√ºnzner stated that his main contributions were not so much in terms of songwriting, but generating riffs and solos for the band, which were then arranged by Grossmann. Apart from the song \\"Universe Momentum\\", M√ºnzner said that he had not written any songs on his own, but relied on writing riffs and solos which were then organized into songs.https://www.truthinshredding.com/2011/06/christian-muenzner-laurie-monk- and-jace.html He appeared in the music video for the single \\"Anticosmic Overload\\". During his time with Obscura, M√ºnzner began developing focal dystonia, which prohibited some of his playing and made touring exhaustive. Citing Obscura's extreme technicality and touring as a hindrance to this disease, M√ºnzner decided to leave the band prior to the release of their fourth record. > \\"My decision to step down from my position as the lead guitar player in > Obscura after more than 6 years was not an easy one, but even though it may > come unexpected for the majority of fans...I am still dealing with a > neurologic condition in my fretting hand called Focal Dystonia, which almost > took the ability to play guitar away from me completely by late 2011/early > 2012. Even though I regained most of my chops by now through re-training and > Botox therapy, the condition is still there and I have to be very careful > not to relapse and undo my progress by putting too much strain on my hand, > which is why touring several months on an album cycle with material that > brings me to the edge of my technical ability every night is not an option > for me anymore in the near future.\\"https://www.realmofobscura.com/drummer- > and-guitarist-quit/ Alkaloid After leaving Obscura, M√ºnzner joined Morean, Danny Tunker, Linus Klausenitzer and Hannes Grossmann as the third guitarist, forming the progressive metal supergroup Alkaloid in 2014, and wrote two songs for their debut album, The Malkuth Grimoire. Focal dystonia After recording the Obscura album Omnivium in 2011, M√ºnzner was diagnosed with focal dystonia. Despite having had this disorder for several years throughout his career, physicians couldn't characterize the disease. M√ºnzner describes the disorder as impairing the coordination between both his index and middle fingers, making the technical demands of his music impossible, forcing him to change his fingering and technique. > \\"Since the index finger is mostly on the strings when playing guitar, my > middle finger cramps back into the hand and I can‚Äôt use it, and the most > simple trill functions between the first 2 fingers became impossible and un- > doable for me. This is why I now tap a lot more with more fingers of my > right hand and I use more slides with the index finger and the pinky...I > still live in constant fear that it starts affecting other fingers...I have > to reduce my performance and practice amount to a healthy degree\\" Despite the disease, M√ºnzner still wrote music and toured with Obscura until his departure from the band.

The voting was to be indirect, as the President had to be elected by the 80,000 \\"basic democrats\\", who made up the Electoral College. These basic Democrats were basically democratically elected public representatives who served in the Divisional, District, Tehsil or Union councils. There were two major parties contesting the elections: the Convention Muslim League and the Combined Opposition Parties. The Combined Opposition Parties consisted of five major opposition parties, and had a nine-point program, which included restoration of parliamentary democracy and introduction of direct elections and adult franchise. The Combined Opposition Parties had no single leadership and were therefore, unable to select a presidential candidate from amongst themselves. Hence, they chose Fatima Jinnah as their candidate who was seen as an undisputed leader due to her relationship with Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, the candidate for Convention Muslim League was the incumbent President Mohammed Ayub Khan. Election campaign There were four candidates: Ayub Khan, Fatima Jinnah and two obscure people with no party affiliation. There was a short campaigning period of one month, which was further restricted to nine projection meetings that were organized by the Election Commission and were attended only by the members of the Electoral College and members of the press. The public was barred from attending the projection meetings, which would have enhanced Fatima Jinnah's image.\\"Trouble with Mother\\". Time Magazine Friday, 25 December 1964 Ayub Khan Ayub Khan had came to power in 1958 following the declaration of the 1958 Pakistani coup d'etat. Since then, he had been serving as a President. He consolidated his position as a Constitutional ruler by drafting the 1962 constitution. At the time the elections were held, Ayub had introduced a number of Economic reforms that had increased the growth rate of the country and had also pulled it out of the severe economic crisis that had begun after the assassination of Prime Minister L.A Khan in 1951. This had made Ayub a popular ruler. Moreover, being the Commander in Chief of Army, he took several steps to turn the odds in his favour. He didn't even hesitate to legislate on electoral matters, giving him an edge over rival candidate, Fatima Jinnah. Fatima Jinnah The campaign of Fatima Jinnah suffered from a number of setbacks. An unfair and unequal election campaign, poor finances, and indirect elections through the Basic Democracy System were some of the primary problems she faced. However, she had overwhelming support among the public. Many had sympathies with her as she was the sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, whilst others saw her an excellent figure to challenge Ayub Khan's Military Dictatorship. Although many clerics had denounced her with the view that a woman cannot lead a Muslim state, several religious leaders also supported her. The Jamaat-e-Islami led by Maududi, was a keen supporter of Ms. Jinnah's campaign as she was a conservative motivated by religious views, as compared to secular Ayub Khan.Presidential Elections Results and aftermath The election results came in favour of the incumbent President Ayub Khan, who, despite losing the popular vote, won 62.43% of the Electoral vote, thanks to faithless electors. Fatima Jinnah won 35.86% of the electoral college votes. Ms. Jinnah was however extremely successful in some areas of the country. She had swept across major urban centres such as Karachi and Dhaka. Ayub also faced disappointing results in East Pakistan. However, Ayub had decisively triumphed in rural Pakistan. As majority of the Electoral College consisted of representatives from the rural setup, Ayub was able to win a clear majority. The election results were not accepted by the Combined Opposition Parties, who accused Ayub Khan of rigging. The COP staged demonstrations and protests, however, didn't gain much public support as Ms. Jinnah accepted the election results. The Election had an effective result. It further strengthened the role of Women in politics in Pakistan. Earlier there were only a handful of women politicians, however since this election women began to enter politics in large numbers and even started to contest for higher posts.

The charters are written in Middle Bulgarian using the Early Cyrillic alphabet. History and details The two earliest Bulgarian royal charters, the Vatopedi Charter given to the Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos, and the Dubrovnik Charter which permitted Ragusan merchants to trade all over the Bulgarian lands, were issued by Tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria after 1230, and are both undated. The Vatopedi Charter was discovered on Mount Athos in 1929 and the Dubrovnik Charter was found in the archives of Dubrovnik in 1817.–î–∞—Å–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞, pp. 7‚Äì11 The Virgino Charter, also from the 13th century, was awarded by Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria to the Monastery of Saint George near Skopje between 1257 and 1777, and was discovered in the Hilandar Monastery. Some researchers consider it a forged document from the late 14th or early 15th century based on the Serbian 14th century Milutin Charter, while others regard it as an original work and believe that it was actually the base for the Milutin Charter. The royal chancellery of Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria awarded two known charters. These are the Zograf Charter of March 1342, confirming the Zograf Monastery's rights over the village of Hantak, and the Oryahov Charter of 1 December 1348 intended for the Saint Nicholas Monastery in Oryahov near Radomir. The Zograf Charter was found in the Zograf Monastery and the Oryahov Charter, written by the clerk Dobromir, is in the Hilandar Monastery. Tsar Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria's chancellery also issued two charters. The Rila Charter dates to 21 September 1378 and was given to the Rila Monastery; it was first published in 1845. Its authenticity is also disputed by some scholars due to its forged seal. The Vitosha Charter was awarded to the Holy Mother of God of Vitosha Monastery in Dragalevtsi in the Vitosha mountains near Sofia, and was discovered in the Zograf Monastery, where it is preserved today. It was issued between 1371 and 1385. Vatopedi Charter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria Brasov Charter of tsar Ivan Stratsimir The chancellery of Tsar Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria awarded the Bra≈üov Charter to the city of Kronstadt (modern Bra≈üov) in Transylvania, permitting merchants from the city to trade freely within Ivan Sratsimir's realm centred in Vidin. It has been dated between 1369 and 1380 and is today located in the State Archives in Bra≈üov, Romania. Although no other charters have been discovered in the original, there is direct evidence of the existence of other charters as well. For example, a charter of Ivan Alexander given to the Venetian doge Andrea Dandolo in Nikopol on 4 October 1352 is kept in a Venetian translation in the archives of Venice. Ivan Alexander's signature has been preserved in its original form in Cyrillic. Importance The charters of the medieval Bulgarian rulers are of great importance to several academic disciplines. From a linguistic point of view, they illustrate the changes in the Bulgarian language in the 13th‚Äì14th century, such as the gradual disintegration of the case system, and the number and type of loanwords. Being some of the few secular sources on the Bulgarian history in the Middle Ages, the charters are of great interest to the researchers of medieval Bulgarian law, as they list contemporary terms for different forms of taxes, agreements, penalties, etc. Most of the charters also enumerate personal names and toponyms, hinting at the development of the name system among the Bulgarians and confirming the medieval existence of many villages and towns, mostly in modern Bulgaria (largely in and near Rila) and North Macedonia (predominantly around Skopje).

History The island was a port for herring fishing, and suffered the decline of that industry. The two settlements were known as Ardnagoine and Garadheancal. In 1881, there were no fewer than 118 people living on Tanera M√≤r, all of whom had left in 1931 (one year after St Kilda was abandoned). Permanent habitation has been intermittent since then, with six people identified as resident in 1961, eight in 1981, none in 1991 and then five at the 2001 census and four in 2011. The island was bought in the early 1960s by Ken Frampton. In September 2012, it was revealed that the island's owners Lizzie and Richard Williams were considering a community buyout with residents on the mainland nearby.

Tanera M√≤r, like the other Summer Isles, can be seen from the Stornoway to Ullapool ferry. The island can be reached by boat from either Achiltibuie in Wester Ross, or Ullapool. Literary references Tanera M√≤r was the location for Frank Fraser Darling's book Island Years (published 1940), which describes experiences living on a remote island. Living in Tanera M√≤r and Dundonnell before that, Fraser Darling began the work that was to mark him as a naturalist-philosopher of original turn of mind and great intellectual drive. He described the social and breeding behaviour of the red deer, gulls, and the grey seal respectively, in the three academic works A Herd of Red Deer, Bird Flocks and the Breeding Cycle and A Naturalist on Rona. The outbreak of World War II put an end to Fraser Darling's hopes of undertaking further research on the grey seal, and being too old for active military service, he chose to farm rather than leave the west coast of Scotland for wartime civilian work. Between 1939 and 1943 Fraser Darling reclaimed derelict land to agricultural production on Tanera M√≤r in the Summer Isles, an undertaking described in his 1943 book Island Farm. In 1942 the wartime Secretary of State for Scotland, Tom Johnston, asked Fraser Darling if he would run an agricultural advisory programme in the crofting areas of the Scottish Highlands and Islands. He agreed, and for two years he travelled, taught and wrote articles that were later published in book form as Crofting Agriculture. The pagan-cult island of Summerisle featured in the motion picture The Wicker Man (filmed 1973) is thought by some film critics to be set in this archipelago, although the movie itself was filmed in Galloway and Skye. The Summer Isles feature in a novella of the same name by Ian R. MacLeod. Wildlife The island's floral diversity is strong due to the lack of grazing over the last 25 years, with northern marsh orchids and butterfly orchids particularly strong. Otters are active, common and grey seals frequently visit from the other nearby Summer Isles, and basking sharks and porpoises pass by in summer. Bird species include eider, heron, red grouse, and buzzards.\\"Overview of Tanera Mor\\" See also * List of islands of Scotland ReferencesExternal links * Summer Isles website * Fraser Darling, Frank (1940) Island Years.

The investigation was designed to determine the physiological and psychological effects of severe and prolonged dietary restriction and the effectiveness of dietary rehabilitation strategies. The motivation of the study was twofold: first, to produce a definitive treatise on the subject of human starvation based on a laboratory simulation of severe famine and, second, to use the scientific results produced to guide the Allied relief assistance to famine victims in Europe and Asia at the end of World War II. The study was developed in coordination with the Civilian Public Service (CPS, 1941-1947) of conscientious objectors and the Selective Service System and used 36 white men selected from a pool of over 200 CPS volunteers. The study was divided into three phases: A twelve-week baseline control phase; a 24-week starvation phase,causing each participant to lose an average of 25% of their pre- starvation body weight; and a recovery phase, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried. Preliminary pamphlets containing key results from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment were used by aid workers in Europe and Asia in the months after WWII. In 1950, Ancel Keys and colleagues published the results in a two-volume, 1,385 page text entitled The Biology of Human Starvation (University of Minnesota Press).  Background and goals  The primary objective of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment was to study in detail the physical and psychological effects of prolonged, famine-like semi- starvation on healthy men, as well as their subsequent effectiveness of dietary rehabilitation from this condition. The motivation of the study was twofold: first, to produce a definitive treatise on the subject of human starvation based on a laboratory simulation of severe famine and, second, to use the scientific results produced to guide the Allied relief assistance to famine victims in Europe and Asia at the end of World War II. It was recognized early in 1944 that millions of people were in grave danger of mass famine as a result of the conflict, and information was needed regarding the effects of semi-starvation‚Äîand the impact of various rehabilitation strategies‚Äîif postwar relief efforts were to be effective.  Principal investigators  Physiologist Ancel Keys was the lead investigator of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. He was directly responsible for the X-ray analysis and administrative work and the general supervision of the activities in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene which he had founded at the University of Minnesota in 1940 after leaving positions at Harvard's Fatigue Laboratory and the Mayo Clinic. Starting in 1941, he served as a special assistant to the U.S. Secretary of War and worked with the Army to develop rations for troops in combat, the K-rations. Keys was Director for the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene for 26 years, retired in 1972 and died in 2004 at the age of 100. Olaf Mickelsen, a biochemist with a Ph.D.from the University of Wisconsin in 1939, was responsible for the chemical analyses conducted in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene during the Starvation Study, and the daily dietary regime of the CPS subjects‚Äîincluding the supervision of the kitchen and its staff. During the study, he was an associate professor of biochemistry and physiological hygiene at the University of Minnesota and . Henry Longstreet Taylor with a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1941 had the major responsibility of recruiting the 36 CPS volunteers, maintaining the morale of the participants and their involvement in the study. During the study he collaborated with Austin Henschel in conducting the physical performance, respiration and postural tests. He joined the faculty at the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene, where he held a joint appointment with the Department of Physiology. His research concentrated on problems in cardiovascular physiology, temperature regulation, metabolism and nutrition, aging and cardiovascular epidemiology. Austin Henschel shared the responsibility of screening the CPS volunteers with Taylor for selection and, had charge of the blood morphology and scheduling all the tests and measurements of the subjects during the course of the study. He was a member of the faculty in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene and the Department of Medicine at the University of Minnesota. Josef Bro≈æek (1914‚Äì2004)In remembrance: Josef Brozek, research professor of psychology was responsible for psychological studies during the Starvation Study, including the psychomotor tests, anthropometric measurements and statistical analysis of the results. He received his PhD in psychology from Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1937 and emigrated to the United States in 1939. He joined the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene at the University of Minnesota in 1941, where he served in a succession of posts over a 17-year period. His research concerned malnutrition and behavior, visual illumination and performance, and aging. Methods= Recruitment of volunteers  The experiment was planned in cooperation with the Civilian Public Service (CPS) and the Selective Service System, using volunteers selected from the ranks of conscientious objectors who had been inducted into public wartime service. Ancel Keys obtained approval from the War Department to select participants from the CPS. Availability of a sufficient number of healthy volunteers willing to subject themselves to the year-long invasion of privacy, nutritional deprivation and physical and mental hardship was essential for the successful execution of the experiment. In early 1944, a recruitment brochure was drafted and distributed within the network of CPS work camps throughout the United States. Over 400 men volunteered to participate in the study as an alternative to military service; of these, about 100 were selected for examination. Drs. Taylor, Bro≈æek, and Henschel from the Minnesota Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene traveled to the various CPS units to interview the potential candidates and administer physical and psychological tests to the volunteers. 36 men were ultimately selected who demonstrated evidence of the required mental and physical health, the ability to get along reasonably well within a group while enduring deprivation and hardship, and sufficient commitment to the relief and rehabilitation objectives of the investigation to complete the study. All subjects were white males, with ages ranging from 22 to 33 years old. Of the 36 volunteer subjects, 15 were members of the Historic Peace Churches (Mennonites, Church of the Brethren and Quakers). Others there included Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, and one of each who was Jewish, Episcopalian, Evangelical & Reformed, Disciples of Christ, Congregational, and Evangelical Mission Covenant, along with two participants without a declared religion.Tucker 2006, pp. ix, x, 69. The 36 CPS participants in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment were: William Anderson, Harold Blickenstaff, Wendell Burrous, Edward Cowles, George Ebeling, Carlyle Frederick, Jasper Garner, Lester Glick, James Graham, Earl Heckman, Roscoe Hinkle, Max Kampelman, Sam Legg, Phillip Liljengren, Howard Lutz, Robert McCullagh, William McReynolds, Dan Miller, L.

Earl Weygandt, Robert Wiloughby and Gerald Wilsnack. Study period and phases The 12-month clinical study was performed at the University of Minnesota between November 19, 1944 and December 20, 1945. Throughout the duration of the study each man was assigned specific work tasks, was expected to walk each week and required to keep a personal diary. Excerpts from Lester Glick's diary. PBS.org, Retrieved February 22, 2011. An extensive battery of tests was periodically administered, including the collection of metabolic and physical measurements; X-ray examinations; treadmill performance; and intelligence and psychological evaluation. The study was divided into four distinct phases: # Control Period (12 weeks): This was a standardization period when the subjects received a controlled diet of approximately 3,200 kilocalories of food each day. The diet of the subjects who were close to their \\"ideal\\" weight was adjusted so as to maintain caloric balance, while the diets of the underweight and overweight individuals was adjusted so as to bring them close to their ideal weight. On average, the group ended up slightly below their \\"ideal\\" weight. In addition, the clinical staff of the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene routinely conducted a series of anthropometric, physiological and psychological tests designed to characterize the physical and mental health of each participant under normal conditions. # Semi-Starvation Period (24 weeks until July 28, 1945): During the 6-month semi-starvation period, each subject's dietary intake was immediately cut in half to about 1,560 kilocalories per day. Their meals were composed of foods that were expected to typify the diets of people in Europe during the latter stages of the war: potatoes, rutabagas, turnips, bread and macaroni. On July 30, 1945, a photo published in Life Magazine showed the shirtless bony participants. # Restricted Rehabilitation Period (12 weeks): The participants were divided into four groups of eight men; each group received a strictly-controlled rehabilitation diet, consisting of one of four different caloric energy levels. In each energy-level group, the men were further subdivided into subgroups receiving differing regimens of protein and vitamin supplements. In this manner, the clinical staff examined various energy, protein and vitamin strategies for re-nourishing the subjects from the conditions of famine. # Unrestricted Rehabilitation Period (8 weeks): For the final rehabilitation period, caloric intake and food content was unrestricted but carefully recorded and monitored. During the starvation period, the subjects received two meals per day designed to induce the same level of nutritional stress for each participant. Since each subject had distinct metabolic characteristics, the diet of each man was adjusted throughout the starvation period to produce roughly a 25% total weight loss over the 24-week period. The researchers tracked each subject's weight as a function of time elapsed since the beginning of the starvation period. For each subject, the weight versus time plot was expected‚Äîas well as enforced‚Äîto form a particular curve, the prediction weight-loss curve, whose characteristics were decided before the commencement of the experiment. The postulated curves turned out to be quite predictive for most subjects. If a subject did veer off his curve in any given week, his caloric intake for the next week would be adjusted, by varying the amount of bread and potatoes, to bring him back to the curve; however, the required adjustments were usually minor. The shapes of the curves were chosen \\"based on the concept that the rate of weight loss would progressively decrease and reach a relative plateau\\" at the final weight. For each subject, the weight vs. time curve was taken to be quadratic in time (in fact, an upward-opening parabola) with the minimum located at 24 weeks, at which point the weight is supposed to be equal to the final target body weight (the minimum is where the curve has zero slope; this corresponds to the \\"plateau\\" mentioned above). Mathematically, this means that the curve for each subject was given by :: W(t)=W_{f}+K\\\\, (24-t)^{2}, where t is the time (measured in weeks) elapsed since the beginning of the starvation period, W(t) is the subject's weight at time t, and W_{f} is the final weight that the subject was supposed to reach at the end of the 24-week period. The constant K is determined by the requirement that W(t=0) be the initial weight W_{i}, i.e. by solving :: W_{i}=W_{f}+K\\\\, (24-0)^{2} for K; this gives :: K=\\\\frac{W_{i}-W_{f}}{24^{2}}. The authors expressed this in terms of the percent total weight loss P, :: P=100 \\\\times \\\\frac{W_{i}-W_{f}}{W_{i}} (which, as stated above, was supposed to be about 25% for all subjects), obtaining :: K=\\\\frac{P}{100 \\\\times 24^{2}}\\\\,W_{i}.  Results  Preliminary pamphlets containing key results from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment were produced and used extensively by aid workers in Europe and Asia in the months after World War II. The full report of results from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment was published 5 years later, in 1950 in a two-volume, 1,385-page text titled The Biology of Human Starvation, University of Minnesota Press. The 50-chapter work contains an extensive analysis of the physiological and psychological data collected during the study, and a comprehensive literature review. Two subjects were dismissed for failing to maintain the dietary restrictions imposed during the starvation phase of the experiment, and the data for two others were not used in the analysis of the results. Among the conclusions from the study was the confirmation that prolonged semi-starvation produces significant increases in depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis as measured using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Indeed, most of the subjects experienced periods of severe emotional distress and depression. The rehab phase proved to be psychologically the hardest phase for most of the men with extreme effects including self-mutilation, where one subject, Sam Legg, amputated three fingers of his hand with an axe, though the subject was unsure if he had done so intentionally or accidentally. Participants exhibited a preoccupation with food, both during the starvation period and the rehabilitation phase. Sexual interest was drastically reduced, and the volunteers showed signs of social withdrawal and isolation. The participants reported a decline in concentration, comprehension and judgment capabilities, although the standardized tests administered showed no actual signs of diminished capacity. There were marked declines in physiological processes indicative of decreases in each subject's basal metabolic rate (the energy required by the body in a state of rest), reflected in reduced body temperature, respiration and heart rate. Some of the subjects exhibited edema in their extremities, presumably due to decreased levels of plasma proteins given that the body's ability to construct key proteins like albumin is based on available energy sources.  Related work  One of the crucial observations of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment discussed by a number of researchers in the nutritional sciences ‚Äîincluding Ancel Keys‚Äî is that the physical effects of the induced semi-starvation during the study closely approximate the conditions experienced by people with a range of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. As a result of the study it has been postulated that many of the profound social and psychological effects of these disorders may result from undernutrition, and recovery depends on physical re-nourishment as well as psychological treatment.

Plot introduction Blow Fly is the twelfth book of the Dr. Kay Scarpetta series by author Patricia Cornwell. Plot summary After her resignation as Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner and the horrifying events which threatened her life in The Last Precinct, Kay Scarpetta has abandoned her elegant home in Richmond, Virginia, and is quietly living in Florida, beginning to get some balance back in her life and slowly establishing herself as a private forensic consultant. (Her first class involves the blow fly, which sometimes lays eggs on corpses.) But her past will not let her rest, and her grief for Benton Wesley continues to grow, not diminish, as does the rage within Lucy, her niece. Then the architect of her changed fortunes contacts her from his cell on death row: deformed, blinded by Scarpetta's own actions, incarcerated in Texas' strongest prison, Jean-Baptiste Chandonne still has the ability to terrify. But, unknown to Scarpetta, there are other forces behind the wolfman's apparent actions, invisibly shepherding her and those closest to her towards eliminating those who threaten them all. It is all orchestrated by the one man in her life who knows every nuance of her soul. In Szczecin, Poland, Lucy and a colleague apparently commit a premeditated murder, using blow-fly larvae to alter the perceived time of death. The novel then ends with the killing of four further people by Scarpetta's associates.

Review of Blow Fly. Book Reporter. One finds that the book,\\"while not for the squeamish... is a tremendous read.\\"Fraser, A. 2003. Review of Blow Fly. The Telegraph. Others, however, as also noted in reviews for later books in the series, such as Trace, considered it to be disappointing. Gail Pennington of the St Louis Post Dispatch states that \\"even the most ardent Cornwell fans may reluctantly realize that enthusiasm for the Scarpetta series is mainly a relic of books past.\\"Pennington, G. 2003. Review of Blow Fly. St Louis Post Dispatch. In Blow Fly, we see a change in narrative style from the first-person narration of Kay herself to a third-person, omniscient, narrator. This device not only allows for more characters and their perspectives to come to the fore, but also marks a significant transformation in the way that the novels represent the criminal. Where previously the criminal's mind was never made available to the reader‚Äîthus intensifying their \\"otherness\\"‚Äîthe later novels allow space to explore their point of view and uncover their motivations.Dauncey, S. University of Warwick. \\"Patricia Cornwell.\\" The Literary Encyclopedia. 18 Nov. 2005. The Literary Dictionary Company. 22 April 2007. This approach does, however, come in for criticism. One reviewer notes that \\"Blow Fly is written in 124 chapters, some as short as a few paragraphs, with close to a dozen shifting points of view. Everyone, it seems, has something to describe, and every bit of description gets equal weight, from a new outfit bought at Saks to a highly technical selection of handguns to the leisurely, sexually charged torture of a young woman. (\\"Every female character in \\"Blow Fly\\" is either miserable or doomed, adding weight to the frequent argument that Cornwell is not just anti-feminist, but anti-woman altogether.\\") Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science * Mostly set in Richmond, Virginia, and Miami, Florida.

He wrote the definitive work on California artists. Life Edan Milton Hughes was born June 4, 1935 in Maysville, Kentucky. He attended the University of Kentucky, where his studies were interrupted by the Korean war. The Navy first brought him to San Francisco as a young man, where he remained till his death. During the period of the '60s and '70s in San Francisco he lived in the Haight-Ashbury section of the city. Hughes enjoyed playing bridge, and going to the Opera. He was not married and had no children, but enjoyed a vast group of friends in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. He died in San Francisco on April 21, 2015. Career Hughes first settled in San Francisco when the Navy brought him there after the war. He was an avid dancer, and found work as a dance instructor, and as a hair stylist in some of the principal San Francisco hotels. He sometimes worked as an assistant to rock promoter Bill Graham and met many of the main rock groups and personalities of the time, including members of the Rolling Stones, Creedence, Carlos Santana, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and the Mamas and the Papas. He also worked in real estate for several years, an activity which brought him into contact with some of the fine art from the state of California which started a lifelong passion. At the time, there was little interest in such art, and he was able to procure many canvases from some of the best artists, unrecognized at the time, for a pittance. This formed the basis of what became a vast collection of California art. His apartment was covered chock-a-block with California paintings, with many others stacked up with wall space left to show it. His interest as a collector, along with an increasing recognition of the value of California art, combined to turn Hughes into an art dealer of California art of the first order. He also published his monumental reference work \\"Artists in California, 1786-1940\\" in 1986 with biographies of over 20,000 California artists, and this work along with Hughes' collection and dealership helped bring California art to the notice of the art world. The Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento took an interest, and helped organize and publish revised editions of the work, which is universally recognized as the definitive work in its field. Publications Hughes is the author of Artists in California, 1786-1940 (1986). The first edition was published in 1986, and received so many follow up inquiries that he decided to produce a second edition with double the amount of content. The third edition is a biographical dictionary which contains information on over 20,000 Californian artists.

The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales (2nd edition ed.). Milnthorpe, Cumbria: Cicerone. .  Geology  The summit and upper slopes of Pen y Gadair Fawr are formed from the Early Devonian Epoch sandstones of the Brownstones Formation, a division of the Old Red Sandstone. Beneath these and forming the lower slopes are the sandstones of the Senni Formation (traditionally the Senni Beds). Mudstone layers within these sandstones are more readily eroded and have given rise to the stepped appearance of parts of the mountain, not least the summit section. Peat has accumulated on parts of the hill in the postglacial period, notably north towards Waun Fach. Access The hill is wholly within land mapped under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 as open country and hence is legally accessible to walkers despite their being no public rights of way leading to it.

The Tin (or Teen) Bigha Corridor () is a strip of land belonging to India on the West Bengal‚ÄìBangladesh border which, in September 2011, was leased to Bangladesh so the country could access its Dahagram‚ÄìAngarpota enclave from the mainland. The enclave remains the only one still in existence after the 2015 resolution of the India-Bangladesh enclaves issue. It is situated in the town of Patgram Upazila. History Road connecting Dahgram-Angarpota enclave with mainland Bangladesh. The border fence around Tin Bigha Corridor. According to the Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Mujibur Rahman treaty of 16 May 1974, India and Bangladesh were to hand over the sovereignty of the Tin Bigha Corridor () and South Berubari () to each other, thereby allowing access to the Dahagram‚ÄìAngarpota enclaves and the Indian enclaves adjacent to South Berubari. Bangladesh did hand over the sovereignty of the smaller South Berubari to India instantly in 1974. India, however, could not transfer the Tin Bigha Corridor to Bangladesh as it required constitutional amendment which could not be done due to political reasons. After much Bangladesh government protest, India, instead of handing over sovereignty in 2011, proposed to lease the Tin Bigha Corridor to Bangladesh for a certain time. South Berubari, meanwhile, would remain in the possession of India. The total area of South Berubari Union No. 12 is of which was to go to Bangladesh. The area of the four Cooch Behar enclaves which would also have to go to Bangladesh was making the total area to be transferred . The population of the area including the four enclaves to be transferred, as per 1967 data, was 90% Hindu. The Bangladesh enclaves, Dahagram and Angorpota, were to be transferred to India. Their total area was and as per 1967 data more than 80% of their population was Muslim. If this exchange had gone through, it would have meant a change of nationality for the population or migration of the population from Dahagram and Angorpota and South Berubari Union No. 12 and consequent serious rehabilitation problems. There were in any case major agitations by the people of Berubari protesting against the transfer. After 1971, India proposed to Bangladesh that India may continue to retain the southern half of South Berubari Union No. 12 and the adjacent enclaves and, in exchange, Dahagram and Angorpota may be retained by Bangladesh. As part of the package a strip of land would be leased in perpetuity by India to Bangladesh, giving her access to Dahagram & Angorpota to enable her to exercise sovereignty on these two enclaves. This was accepted by Bangladesh as part of a carefully constructed Land Boundary Agreement signed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 16 May 1974. The Berubari dispute was thus finally resolved by Article 1.14 of the Agreement which stated: \\"India will retain the southern half of South Berubari Union No. 12 and the adjacent enclaves, measuring an area of approximately, and in exchange Bangladesh will retain the Dahagram and Angorpota enclaves. India will lease in perpetuity to Bangladesh an area of near 'Tin Bigha' to connect Dahagram with Panbari Mouza (P.S.

Access to corridor Indian BSF Camp at Tin Bigha Corridor. The corridor was previously open for 12 daylight hours only, causing great hardships for the inhabitants of the enclave, given the fact that the enclave has no hospitals or law enforcement facilities. Following a treaty signed by the Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh on 6 September 2011 in Dhaka, it was agreed that the corridor would be open for 24 hours for Bangladeshis in the enclave to access the mainland. The corridor was officially declared open by the Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina on 19 October 2011. Infrastructure Until recently, the enclaves had no hospitals or colleges.

The party was founded in 1958, through the merger of the Kono Progressive Movement and the Sierra Leone Independence Movement. The objective of the party was, according to its founding declaration, to \\"prosecute more vigorously a political campaign for national unity and independence.\\" Kono Mannda, the mouthpiece of the erstwhile KPM, became the organ of the SLPIM in Kono. The party suffered from repression from the government, SLST and Paramount Chiefs. In September 1960, Mbriwa was jailed for six months. In February 1961, Mbriwa was elected Paramount Chief of Fiama Chiefdom. In 1962 an alliance was declared between SLPIM and the All People's Congress. One day after the announcement, President Albert Margai dismissed Mbriwa.Salone Entertainment In the election SLPIM obtained 5.2% of the national vote and four seats (all from Kono). Outside of Kono, the candidates of the party fared poorly.Elections in Sierra Leone In 1963 the Sierra Leone People's Party began pressurizing the SLPIM parliamentarians to join the government bloc. The alliance with APC was broken and the party was divided on how to relate to the SLPP. Three of the four SLPIM MPs, S. L. Matturi, D. S. Bockari and G. W. Mani, joined the SLPP. Leading figures who remained with SLPIM, such as the family of T.R. Foyoh, went into exile. In the mid-1960s the SLPIM was dissolved by Mbriwa. The sole remaining SLPIM Member of Parliament, S.H.

Plot introduction Homecoming, set in the very early 1980s, tells the story of four siblings aged between six and thirteen, whose mother abandons them one summer afternoon in their car next to a Connecticut shopping mall during an aborted road trip to a family member in Bridgeport. Realizing that their mother is not coming back, and that they cannot go home (as their father walked out before the youngest child was born), the children travel together, mostly on foot, trying to reach Bridgeport. There, they hope to find their missing mother at the home of a relative they have never met. The children find themselves on a journey that is emotional as well as literal; during their weeks on the road, their adventures and the people they meet along the way help them to find out more about who they are and what is important to them, as well as to cope with the loss of their mother and to understand society's reaction to her poverty, isolation, mental illness, and the fact that she was an unmarried mother of four. Thirteen-year-old Dicey Tillerman, and her brothers James (10) and Sammy (6), and sister Maybeth (9), lived in a wooden house out in the dunes in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The family is poor, their father walked out just before Sammy was born, and only Dicey retains any memory of him. Their mother worked herself too hard (physically and emotionally) to take care of her four children and make ends meet. The novel begins when the Tillerman children find themselves alone in their car, some miles from their home, in a shopping mall parking lot in Peewauket, apparently Connecticut. Momma had driven them away from home, saying that they were going to visit her Aunt Cilla in Bridgeport, Connecticut. At the mall, she parked the car and walked away, instructing the children to do what Dicey told them. After waiting for a few hours, Dicey begins to understand that Momma is not coming back. Worried that going to the authorities might place her siblings and herself in foster homes and split them up, Dicey decides that the four children must try to continue on to Aunt Cilla themselves, and that hopefully they will find their mother there. The children set off on foot, as they do not have enough money for a bus. Dicey realizes that the journey is longer than she had initially thought it would be. She then takes charge of their meager finances, by earning money whenever necessary and possible. Dicey comes to understand more fully how difficult things must have been for Momma, and how she must have slowly lost hope (and eventually her sanity). The children's journey is a long one. They are often hungry and sad and have some frightening brushes with danger. When their money runs out in the center of New Haven, Dicey makes James, Maybeth, and Sammy sleep under a bush in a park, while she watches over them. They are rescued by a college student, Windy, who feeds them and offers them shelter. The next day, Stewart, Windy's roommate, gives the children a ride to Bridgeport, dropping them off outside Aunt Cilla's house. At Aunt Cilla's, Dicey and her family learn some uncomfortable truths: their mother is not there and Aunt Cilla is recently deceased. Her middle-aged, unmarried daughter Eunice, a devout Catholic, is reluctant to be burdened with the Tillerman children. She had plans to enter a convent and taking in the homeless children will put an end to her dreams of becoming a nun. The children are not Catholic, and their parents were unmarried, which Eunice does not like. Reluctantly, with the advice of a Catholic priest, she takes them in. The police try to trace the children's mother. The younger children are put into a Catholic summer camp, while Dicey is made to stay home and help Eunice keep house. Sammy gets into fights and is unruly and difficult when at home. Maybeth is extremely shy and has learning difficulties. Cousin Eunice believes she is \\"retarded\\", and that Sammy is unmanageable. James becomes distant from his family. The children are informed that their mother is completely catatonic in a Massachusetts state psychiatric hospital, without much chance of recovery. As a result, any dream they harbored of being reunited with Momma and starting a new life with her is shattered. Dicey plans to leave Eunice's house alone, in search of a better home for her family with her grandmother, who lives in Crisfield, Maryland. Although she had only planned to visit her, the other Tillerman children sneak away from school to join her. The Tillerman family finds itself on the road again in search of a home; this ends the first part of the novel. The second journey, like the first, is hard and fraught with danger. Attempting to earn money by picking tomatoes, the children find themselves nearly captured by their employer who has apparently taken an interest in Maybeth. In an attempt to escape, the children are helped by a traveling circus who drive the children to Crisfield. Abigail Tillerman, the children's grandmother, lives alone on a run-down farm. She tells Dicey that the children cannot live there and that she can shelter them for only one night. However, Dicey realizes that the farm would be good for her family, and that they have nowhere else to go. She and her family try to win their grandmother over by doing work around the farm. Dicey learns that her grandmother is frightened of becoming emotionally attached to the Tillerman children, in case she were to lose them as she lost her own children. Mrs. Tillerman confesses to Dicey that she bears the pain of this, and fears repeating the same failures. Eventually, Mrs. Tillerman comes to the realization that besides caring deeply for the four children, she can and will offer them a permanent home, despite the emotional and financial fears she has. The novel ends with Dicey feeling that she and her family have come home at last. Characters *Dicey Tillerman is the novel's main protagonist. Dicey is a thirteen-year-old girl who is unconcerned with external appearances ‚Äì her haircut and clothes make many people think she is a boy. Dicey has brown hair and hazel eyes. She displays a fierce determination to survive and keep her family together. Dicey, as the oldest child of a mentally unwell single mother, is used to playing the role of an adult in her family, but when their mother abandons them, Dicey steps into greater responsibility than she ever had. Dicey is tough, pragmatic, and suspicious of anyone outside of the circle formed by her immediate family, only taking help from others when she absolutely needs to do so. She is willing to do everything within her power and take any risks necessary to protect her siblings and keep them together. *James Tillerman is the next eldest child. At ten, he is a thinker rather than a doer, and a natural loner. He loves books and learning, and likes to think out the answers to difficult questions. James did well academically but did not have any friends at school. He respects those who he believes are intelligent, sometimes without questioning their morals. When he falls and hurts his head during an overnight stay in a park, he pretends to be more injured than he really is so that the family can stay a few more days in the company of teenage runaways Louis and Edie, because he believes Louis is smart, even though Louis is a thief and a nihilist. When Sammy starts to emulate Louis by stealing food for the family, James supports his act, quoting Louis by saying that everyone must look out for himself and the only certainty in life is death. Later in the novel, James steals money himself and only listens to the rational explanations of Stewart, the student from whom he stole. *Maybeth Tillerman is nine years old, and very pretty with blonde hair and a gentle, accommodating personality. She is extremely quiet and shy, and is thought to have learning difficulties, although the novel does not go into details about what these might be. We learn only that she has been kept behind a year at school, that she worried her teachers who sent many notes home to her mother. The notes went unanswered, and it is believed by Maybeth's teachers that she cannot read or do simple mathematics. In reality, although slow, she is just far too shy at school. She is scared and distrustful of others, apart from her family. Maybeth demonstrates mature, developed emotional perception and awareness, capable of seeing the real character of people. She is a talented singer and looks like Momma physically. Dicey and James are afraid that Maybeth may have inherited her mother's tendency to depression and insanity. *Samuel \\"Sammy\\" Tillerman is the youngest Tillerman. He is a robust child, who had problems with discipline at school, often getting into fights when the other children taunted him about his \\"crazy\\" mother, lack of a father, and his slow sister Maybeth. Sammy prefers physical activity to thinking out ideas, is brave and very loyal to his family. Of all the Tillermans, he is most affected by his mother's sudden disappearance and has difficulty in accepting that she is not going to come back to them. Sammy is capable of being recklessly happy, although the difficulties he has faced in his short life, and the trauma of losing his Momma, have dampened this side of his character. During the long journey, he is sometimes stubborn and sullen. *Momma is Liza, the Tillermans' mother. Momma features in the story mainly via the reminiscences and thoughts of the four children and Gram ‚Äì she only appears in the novel once, briefly, at the very beginning, when she says goodbye to her children before abandoning them in the car. According to Gram, Momma was a gentle and quiet young woman who decided when she left home at the age of 21 never to marry, having learned from her parents that marriage leads to bitterness and lies. The images of Momma that are filtered through her children's and mother's memories paint a picture of a loving and beautiful woman, but one who is neither particularly reliable nor practical. There appears to have been an idealistic and almost reckless side to her character; she has four children by her itinerant, gambling boyfriend ‚Äì with whom Dicey remembers her having \\"real fights\\", although the couple do not have the financial means or stability to bring them up. However, Momma truly does love all her children and gave them everything she had. When Momma becomes pregnant with Sammy, their fourth child, the children's father is angry about it and soon leaves her, (it is suggested) under legal duress as Dicey remembers a visit from the police following his absence. Momma struggles under the responsibility of raising her four children on her own, but eventually buckles under the pressure. Immediately prior to the events of the novel, Dicey recalls that Momma lost her job as a supermarket checker, and started to behave more and more erratically, going missing for hours on end and not speaking to the children. *Gram is Abigail Tillerman, the children's maternal grandmother, although Dicey and her siblings had never heard anything about her and she did not know of them either. The children hear about her first through Cousin Eunice in Bridgeport, where they learn that Gram is considered extremely eccentric, even crazy. When the children meet Gram for the first time, she is a widow, her husband John having died only a couple of years previously. Gram is enjoying her solitude and voluntary isolation after years of reining in her strong personality to accommodate her strict husband. Gram had always obeyed her husband even when she knew he was wrong. Her inflexibility, it is inferred, helped to drive away her three children, John (who is apparently a lawyer somewhere in California), Liza (the children's mother, who ran away from home and refused to marry the father of her children) and Samuel (\\"Bullet\\"), who was killed in Vietnam. Gram, like Dicey, is fiercely independent and at first is not ready to accept responsibility for her four abandoned grandchildren because she fears the emotional attachments that this will bring, and also that she will repeat the same mistakes she made with her own children. *Cousin Eunice is the only daughter of Aunt Cilla, their mother's cousin and niece to Gram. Eunice is unmarried and a pious Catholic, whose life is governed by routine and what she sees as her duty. Her greatest desire is to become a nun and enter a convent. Eunice is \\"silly\\", almost completely incapable of spontaneity and affection. While she does take in the Tillerman children, she does so from a sense of \\"duty\\" and expects the children to show gratitude and to earn their keep through good behaviour, and, in Dicey's case, through taking on nearly all of the household chores. Minor characters *Windy and Stewart - two college students who shelter, feed and help the Tillerman family for one night in New Haven before Stewart drives the children to Bridgeport. Neither young man seems to care about what happens to them *Will Hawkins, the owner of a circus, and Claire, a dog trainer in the circus, who rescue and help the Tillermans, and who both return to see if the Tillerman children are all right at their grandmother's house. *Tom and Jerry, two boys who help them with crossing the ocean. *Edie and Louise,e two teenagers whom they meet at the state park they stayed in for a few days. Major themes *Belonging: The theme of belonging runs throughout the whole book. The children search for a home, a physical place where they can belong. They search Toesses, they belong together. The children also struggle to see where they belong in the wider world, in society. The children have trouble belonging in schools, they each are different on whether they can stand their grounds. *Breaking societal conventions: This theme is strongly linked, and often inseparable from, that of Belonging. Because the Tillermans come from a non-traditional family (their parents remained unmarried, and their father left before the youngest child was born), they are to some degree on the margins of society. Dicey lies to the younger children, saying she remembers a wedding. At school, all the children are bullied because of their parentage: James and Dicey do not have friends, Sammy and Dicey get into fistfights. Cousin Eunice and her religious adviser similarly disapprove of their status and lack of religion: Dicey is told that she \\"must have another name\\". Gram is a woman who has deliberately removed herself from mainstream society, choosing to live alone and adopt \\"eccentric\\" behaviour, such as bare feet, and odd dress. Both Gram and (to a lesser extent) Dicey grow to realise that it is not possible to live in isolation. Gram accepts first her grandchildren and then the Welfare money necessary to help feed and clothe them. She takes charge of enrolling the children in local schools. Dicey accepts that she, too, will go to school and learn like a normal child. She learns at various points in the novel that she must accept outside help (just like her grandmother), or that she must rely on others rather than on just herself, if she is to survive. Yet, at many points in the novel, breaking conventions is shown to elicit personal growth, or at least to help the characters survive a difficult situation, whereas following convention is shown to inhibit growth and harm characters. By breaking gender roles, Dicey is able to escape authority and look after her family. However, by her rigid adherence to habit, Cousin Eunice (who wants to literally clothe herself in a nun's habit) is unable to properly love the children, bound as she is by her ideas of \\"duty\\" and of doing what she believes the world to expect of her. Gram, too, has harmed herself and those around her by adhering to convention and to \\"duty\\": by sticking by her rigid husband even when she knows in her heart he is wrong, she has destroyed her family. *The sea and sailing: All of the kids can swim, and love of the ocean is a defining trait of Dicey from the novel's start. As her thoughts develop on her journey, it's clear that sea/water journeying is her metaphor for life. In Part 2 of the book, the four Tillermans need to travel from Annapolis to Maryland's Eastern shore; two boys Tom and Jerry take them over on a sailboat, and this journey is pivotal for Dicey. Far from shore, when the wind is feeble, she is allowed to control the tiller, and at the trip's end, Jerry says \\"I've never seen anybody take to it like that\\" . In Dicey's Song, she is determined to fix an old boat she finds at Gram's farm, and continue to learn to sail. The family name, Tillerman also connects to the sailing theme. *Family as home: The children learn the importance of families throughout the novel. Their \\"Homecoming\\" is a journey that leads them to a long-lost grandmother, the mother of their beloved - and now lost - Momma, and a key to unlocking their family history. They start to learn that families can be fragile, and that if they are not nurtured and protected, they can fall apart as Gram's family has. This is a theme that is explored in much more depth in the next novel in the Tillerman Cycle, Dicey's Song. Geography In her Afterword to the novel, Voigt explains that although the Tillerman family and the events described are all fictional, the geography of the book is accurate. However, some of the places mentioned are either fictional or deliberately or unintentionally misnamed. *Peewauket, Connecticut: The town in which the children are abandoned. Although no place with this name exists, there is a town near Stonington, Connecticut, named Pawcatuck (pronounced Paw-kit-tuk, with the accent on the Paw), which is probably the place Voigt refers to. *Rockland State Park, Connecticut: There is a Rockland State Park, but it is ninety miles from the coast and so is not the shoreline park the children stay in for a few days after James hurts his head in a fall. This park is likely to be Rocky Neck State Park, which fits the description and location. *Landing Neck Road, Crisfield, Maryland: While Crisfield is a real town and the descriptions of it appear accurate, there is no Landing Neck Road, although there are run- down farms in the area described. Homecoming in the Tillerman Cycle This novel is the first in a seven-part series, known as the Tillerman Cycle. The novel introduces some of the main characters in the cycle, and refers to others, such as Bullet Tillerman and Francis Verricker. Apart from Dicey's Song, which describes events immediately following Homecoming, the Tillerman Cycle is not chronological. Each book in the series follows events in the lives of different characters introduced in Dicey's Song or Homecoming. Seventeen Against the Dealer takes up events in Dicey's life when she is 21. A Solitary Blue concerns events in the life of Jeff Greene, a character introduced in Dicey's Song and a central figure in Seventeen Against the Dealer. The Runner is about Samuel 'Bullet' Tillerman, the children's late uncle and Gram's son. Sons from Afar tells the story of James' and Sammy's search for the lost father, Francis Verricker. Come a Stranger describes events in the life of Mina, a character introduced in Dicey's Song. Homecoming can be seen as the first in a two-part series, which forms the basis for the explorations of character that occur throughout the rest of the Tillerman Cycle.

Since Roman times it has always been present in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. Characteristics The largest Christian group in Libya is the Coptic Orthodox Church (Copts in Libya), with a population of 60,000. The Coptic Church is known to have historical roots in Libya long before the Arabs advanced westward from Egypt into Libya. However, the Roman Catholics have a large number as well, with 50,000 members. Orthodox communities other than that of the Egyptian Copts include the Russian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, and the Greek Orthodox. There is one Anglican congregation in Tripoli, made up mostly of African immigrant workers, that belongs to the Egyptian Anglican diocese. The Anglican bishop of Libya has his seat in Cairo. There is also a priest in Sabha. There are relatively peaceful relations between Christians and Muslims in Libya. However, there are restrictions for Christian religious activity. It is prohibited to proselytize Muslims, even though a non-Muslim man must convert to Islam if he wants to marry a Muslim woman. Also, religious literature is restricted. In spite of opposition to Christianity, a 2015 estimates some 1,500 Christian believers from a Muslim background residing in the country.  Christian denominations= Coptic Orthodox Church  Currently, there are 60,000 Copts in Libya, as they have many roots in North Africa (primarily Egypt). Historically speaking, Christianity spread to the Pentapolis in North Africa from Egypt; Synesius of Cyrene (370-414), bishop of Ptolemais, received his instruction at Alexandria in both the Catechetical School and the Museion, and he entertained a great deal of reverence and affection for Hypatia, the last pagan Neoplatonists, whose classes he had attended. Synesius was raised to the episcopate by Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, in 410. The Council of Nicaea in 325 made Cyrenaica an ecclesiastical province of the See of Alexandria. The Pope of Alexandria to this day includes the Pentapolis in his title as an area within his jurisdiction. The Coptic congregations in several countries were under the ancient Eparchy of the Western Pentapolis, which was part of the Coptic Orthodox Church for centuries until the thirteenth century.History of the Coptic Church, by Father Menassa Youhanna In 1971 Pope Shenouda III reinstated it as part of the Eparchy of Metropolitan Bishop Pachomius, Metropolitan of the Holy Metropolis of Beheira (Thmuis & Hermopolis Parva), (Buto), Mariout (Mareotis), Marsa Matruh (Paraetonium), (Apis), Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Metropolis of Libya: (Livis, Marmarica, Darnis & Tripolitania) & Titular Metropolitan Archbishop of the Great and Ancient Metropolis of Pentapolis: (Cyren), (Appollonia), (Ptolemais), (Berenice) and (Arsinoe). This was one among a chain of many restructuring of several eparchies by Pope Shenouda III, while some of them were incorporated into the jurisdiction of others, especially those who were within an uncovered region or which were part of a Metropolis that became extinct, or by dividing large eparchies into smaller more manageable eparchies. This was also a part of the restructuring of the Church as a whole. They are currently three Coptic Orthodox Churches in Libya: one in Tripoli, Libya (Saint Mark's), one in Benghazi, Libya (Saint Antonios ‚Äî two priests), and one in Misrata, Libya (Saint Mary and Saint George).Coptic Orthodox Church Listings for Libya (P. 136)  Roman Catholic Church  Massah in 1940 The Cathedral of Tripoli in the 1960s. There are about 50,000 Roman Catholics, mostly Italian Libyans and Maltese Libyans. The Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli (Our Lady of the Angels) in the Old City - Medina of Tripoli was founded in 1645 and, with the permission of the Sultan of Constantinople, the Church of the Immaculate Conception was founded in Benghazi in 1858. Before World War II the number of Catholics increased in Libya due to Italian colonialism.

However, most returned home or moved on to other countries; , only 405 Koreans lived in the country, according to the statistics of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Migration history South Korean migration to Iran grew at an average annual rate of 90% between 1971 and 1977, although the total number of migrants from Korea grew only by an annual average of 18% during that same period; South Koreans departing their home country for Iran composed just 0.2% of all officially-registered emigrants in 1971 (roughly 150 individuals), and only 177 individuals in 1974, but 1.8% (2,402 individuals) in 1975 and 3.4% (6,264 individuals) in 1977. The vast majority were male.Korea Statistical Yearbooks for 1972, 1976, 1978. Quoted in Hyundai Construction's first project in the entire Middle East was a 1975 contract for the construction of a shipyard for the Iranian Navy near Bandar-e Abbas, and they and other chaebol quickly expanded their business in the region. Between 1977 and 1979, nearly 300,000 South Korean workers from two dozen companies came to work in the Middle East. The largest proportion of those went to Saudi Arabia, though Iran was also a major destination; at one point, migration to Iran made up 17% of all migration to the region. In total, in the decade following 1975, 25,388 South Koreans went to Iran. The 1979 Iranian Revolution would have a negative effect on South Korean business in Iran, as well as proving dangerous for Korean workers in the country; on one occasion, revolutionaries attacked a construction site seeking to drive away \\"foreign devils\\"; five workers were killed and twenty others injured in a traffic accident that arose as they fled. The Korean Air Force had to be called in to evacuate Korean nationals. The number of South Koreans going to Iran fell from 7,418 in 1978 to 64 in 1979 and only 30 in 1980, though by 1985 the rate of migration had recovered to almost half of its pre-revolutionary level, with 3,669 migrants. However, due to the economic effects of the revolution and the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, as well as South Korea's rising labour costs, the practise of importing labourers from South Korea to work in the Middle East slowly became less widespread during the late 1980s; for example, the proportion of Korean labourers working on construction projects for Hyundai declined from 70% to only 20-30%, with the shortfall being taken up by local labourers instead. By 2009, only 614 South Korean nationals remained in the country. They consist primarily of government officials, corporate expatriates, and Koreans married to Iranians. By 2011, the number of South Korean nationals or former nationals in the country had shrunk further, to 405 persons. Among them, 42 (3 men, 39 women) had Iranian nationality, 20 were international students, and the remaining 342 had other kinds of visas. Most (315) lived in Tehran, with a smaller concentration of 32 at Asaluyeh. North Koreans also have a presence in the country, mainly related to their assistance to Iran's nuclear programme; according to The Los Angeles Times, there is one hotel in Tehran and another on the Caspian Sea coast set aside for the use of North Korean diplomats. Community organisations The Korean Association of Iran () was set up in 1970. Its president, Jo Seung-mi, graduated from Hanyang University and formerly worked as a ballet dancer. She met her Iranian husband while he was studying at the Seoul Agricultural College (now part of the University of Seoul) as an international student; in 1977, she followed him back to Iran. She was elected to her post in 1997. , the association had roughly 300 members. Iran's sole school for South Korean nationals, the Tehran Korean School (; also known as the Korean Embassy School), was established on 30 April 1976; it uses Korean as the primary medium of instruction, with English used for science and computer classes, and Persian offered as a foreign language. , it enrolled 29 elementary-school students.

In the other seat contested by KPM, the KPM candidate A.A. Mani was defeated by the SLPP candidate Paul Dunbar by a margin of 3105 to 3061 votes. However, since Dunbar was later disqualified on grounds of corruption, a by-election was held. In the by-election A.A. Mani defeated Dunbar's wife.

Of his nine books, his magnum opus is considered to be 1999's Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of American Independent Film'. the most widely read film book in the history of NYU Press. The book examines the various social, political, economic and artistic forces that have shaped the emergence of low-budget American indies as a distinct institutional cinema, operating parallel to and against Mainstream Hollywood Cinema. Levy wrote the first comprehensive biography of Vincente Minnelli, Vincente Minnelli: Hollywood's Dark Dreamer in 2009. In this book, he argued that Minnelli's sexual identity is a crucial variable in understanding the kinds of narratives and visual styles of his films, particularly his melodramas, such as The Bad and The Beautiful, and the more personal and intimate Tea and Sympathy. In 2000, he co-organized with the Film Department of the Los Angeles County Art Museum a tribute weekend to the influential critic Andrew Sarris, coinciding with the publication of Citizen Sarris: American Film Critic, Essays in Honor of Andrew Sarris. On that occasion, Sarris chose to screen The Shop Around the Corner and Shoot the Piano Player, films that were followed by panels headed by noted critics Richard Schickel and Oscar-winning director Curtis Hanson.

Career Versatile back Kydd was one of Budge Pountney's earliest signings for Northampton Saints but the club were forced out of the deal when Kydd suffered what could have been a career-ending knee injury in training while at his former club Saracens. Saints, however, took their duty of care very seriously and actively helped to rehabilitate the former New Zealand U21s player. Kydd always said he would be back for Christmas 2005 and he made his Saints debut just a few weeks over that deadline at a time when Saints were desperately short of centres. He played for more than 60 minutes on his debut against Worcester and helped Saints onto their first league win over their Midlands rivals since the Warriors were promoted. Kydd made six appearances following that memorable day and is a useful man to have around as he covers fly-half, centre and full-back and has a mean goal-kicking boot on him too. This positional flexibility was utilised throughout the 2006/07 campaign thanks to Saints backline injuries. Kydd's starring moment came in the Heineken Cup quarter final in San Sebastian, when his opportunism and anticipatory instincts saw him intercept a Dimitri Yachvili pass and race over 60 metres for the match-winning try. Kydd ended the season with 26 appearances and a selection for Scotland's Churchill Cup squad. He was called up to the senior Scotland squad for the autumn tests in 2006. Kydd became a fixture in the Saints side once more in the first few months of 2007/08. Unfortunately he suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon in the home game against Coventry that has ruled him out of the game for several months. His latest profile on the official Northampton Saints website reports that he has subsequently left the club. Kydd signed for Bath Rugby on a one- year contract in 2008/09. Kydd, who can play at fly-half, fullback and in the centre, has previously played for Bath in 2003/04. He departed Bath at the end of the season, joining Rugby Calvisano.

He is best known for his appearances with the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the ring name, Boris Zhukov, as well as his appearances with Jim Crockett Promotions as (Private) Jim Nelson.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1978‚Äì1980)  Inspired by his Northside High School football coach and hope to become a pro wrestler, 160-pound wide receiver and defensive halfback Harrell became interested in gaining mass in his senior year, 1977. While exercising at a YMCA, he met Ric McCord, who introduced him to Don Hogan and Steve Savage, two wrestlers from Salem, Virginia who trained him. After wrestling in Virginia in a tag team, Harrell moved to Atlanta, Georgia. In his first big match, the 210-pound Harrell (now called Jim Nelson) teamed with Mike Stallings to lose to Ivan Koloff and Ole Anderson.  Jim Crockett Promotions (1980‚Äì1983)  Harrell debuted in Jim Crockett Promotions in August 1980, wrestling as \\"Jim Nelson\\". In December 1981, Harrell adopted the name \\"Private Jim Nelson\\" and joined Sgt. Slaughter's villainous \\"Cobra Corps\\". He formed a tag team with fellow Corps member Don Kernodle. In May 1982, Nelson and Kernodle defeated Jay Youngblood and Porkchop Cash to win the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship. They lost the titles to Cash and Iceman Parsons in June, but regained them later that month. Their second reign lasted until August 1982 when they lost to Youngblood and Ricky Steamboat. In early 1983, Harrell left the Cobra Corps and began feuding with Slaughter and Kernodle, losing to Kernodle in a series of \\"boot camp matches\\" in April and May. He left Jim Crockett Promotions in May 1983.  Mid-South Wrestling (1983)  In May 1983, Harrell joined the Louisiana-based Mid-South Wrestling promotion as \\"Boris Zurhkov\\". He left the promotion in September 1983.  World Class Wrestling Association (1983)  In August 1983, Harrell began wrestling for the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling promotion. He adopted the character of \\"Boris Zurkov\\", a mercenary hired by Skandor Akbar to face Bruiser Brody. He left the promotion in December 1983.  Southeastern Championship Wrestling (1984, 1985)  In January 1984, Harrell debuted in the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southeastern Championship Wrestling promotion as \\"Boris Zhukov\\". He feuded with wrestlers including Jacques Rougeau, Jimmy Golden, and Rick McGraw. In August 1984, Harrell defeated McGraw for the NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Porkchop Cash the following month. He left the promotion in October 1984. Harrell returned to the promotion the following March, this time wrestling under a mask as \\"Mr. Russia\\". He left the next month after losing a mask versus mask Lights Out match to Mr. Olympia.  American Wrestling Association (1985‚Äì1987)  In April 1985, Harrell debuted in the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association as \\"Boris Zukhov\\", adopting Chris Markoff as his manager. During 1985, he unsuccessfully challenged AWA World Heavyweight Champion Rick Martel and AWA America's Champion Sgt. Slaughter. In early 1986, Harrell formed a tag team with Nord the Barbarian. The duo occasionally teamed with other foreign heels such as The Mongolian Stomper and Adnan Al-Kaissie. After the tag team dissolved in August 1986, Harrell unsuccessfully challenged AWA World Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwinkel on several occasions. In April 1987, Harrell formed another team team with Soldat Ustinov, winning a tag team tournament. The following month, they defeated The Midnight Rockers for the AWA World Tag Team Championship. In September 1987, Harrell left the AWA to join the World Wrestling Federation, with the explanation given being that Wahoo McDaniel had driven him out on the promotion after a brutal chain match.  World Wrestling Federation (1987‚Äì1991)  Harrell debuted in the World Wrestling Federation in October 1987, once again performing as \\"Boris Zhukov\\". He formed a villainous tag team with fellow pseudo-Russian Nikolai Volkoff known as \\"The Bolsheviks\\". Over the following 15 months, The Bolsheviks competed against teams such as The British Bulldogs, The Killer Bees, The Powers of Pain, The Rougeau Brothers, and The Young Stallions. Both men entered the 1988 Royal Rumble, which was won by Jim Duggan. In October 1988, Zhukov took part in the King of the Ring tournament, losing to Mike Sharpe in the first round. The Bolsheviks separated in early 1989 after Volkoff temporarily departed the WWF, with Zhukov competing as a single wrestler. His regular opponents included Paul Roma, Ronnie Garvin, and Tim Horner. In September 1989, Volkoff returned to the WWF and reformed their tag team. In December 1989, The Bolsheviks began a lengthy series of matches with The Bushwhackers. At WrestleMania VI in April 1990, The Bolsheviks lost to The Hart Foundation in a squash. The Bolsheviks permanently disbanded in May 1990, with Volkoff turning face by embracing America and feuding with Zhukov. After the feud ended in August 1990, Zhukov faced Koko B. Ware in a series of matches. At Survivor Series 1990, Zhukov teamed with Sato, Sgt. Slaughter, and Tanaka as \\"The Mercenaries\\", losing to \\"The Alliance\\" (Volkoff, The Bushwhackers, and Tito Santana). Zhukov left the WWF in February 1991.  Late career (1991‚Äì2001)  In January 1991, Harrell made a brief tour of Japan with the Super World of Sports promotion. In April 1991, Harrell began wrestling for the Universal Wrestling Association in Florida and New York. He made his final appearance in June 1991 at the Beach Brawl pay-per-view in Palmetto, Florida, defeating Paul Samson. After leaving the UWA, Harrell wrestled sporadically over the following decade. He formally retired in 2001. In 2007, Zhukov resurfaced as a heel in Virginia-based promotion American Championship Wrestling (ACW) and allied with local heel Eclipso. He was attacked and injured, leading to a face turn and a \\"Wrestle or Retire\\" match on September 8 for Eclipso's ACW Championship. Before the match, Zhukov told the crowd he was retiring, but a replacement had been chosen. Later that night, his old persona, Pvt. Jim Nelson (who had not been seen since an assault by Jack & Gerry Brisco in 1983) was revealed as that replacement. Now clean-shaven and dressed in army camouflage, he'd redone Sgt. Slaughter's boot camp and was promoted to Sgt. Jim Nelson in a pre-match ceremony. Nelson won the match and title after interference from both managers. Due to the controversy, the title was held up. Personal life In July 2016, Zhukov was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

In 1979, Rippan Kapur, an Indian Airlines purser, started CRY with 6 friends and just Rs. 50. Today over 4 decades later, CRY works with 102 grassroots NGOs across 19 states in India and has impacted the lives of over 3 million children. CRY addresses children‚Äôs critical needs by working with parents, teachers, Anganwadi workers, communities, district and state level governments as well as the children themselves. The organization focuses on changing behaviours and practices at the grassroots level and influencing public policy at a systemic level, thus creating an ecosystem where children are made the nation‚Äôs priority. Children‚Äôs Rights Issues  At 472 million, children account for 40% of India‚Äôs population. And yet, only 3.16% of the 2020 Union Budget was allocated to their development and welfare. In fact, the National Plan of Action for Children recommends that budgetary allocations for children should be 5% of the country‚Äôs GDP - India has been stagnant at 0.43% of GDP for the last two years. India‚Äôs children thus battle some of the worst circumstances in the world. An estimated 46 million children, between 6-18 years of age, do not go to school (RGI Census Population Projection 2016 and UDISE 2016-17) *33 million child labourers go to work instead of school (Census 2011) *1 of 3 child brides in the world is from India (Unicef 2014) *2 of 3 child deaths, below the age of 5, are caused by malnutrition (Unicef 2019) *7.4 Million children are still not immunized; the highest in the world (Unicef) *There has been a 500% increase in crimes against children between 2008-2018 (NCRB 2018) According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which was ratified by India in 1992, all children have fundamental rights which must be recognized by governments and citizens alike. Keeping that in mind, CRY works on 4 key areas: *Education (Right To Development) *Health & Nutrition (Right To Survival) *Safety & Protection (Right To Protection) *Child Participation (Right To Participation) History Established in 1979 as Child Relief and You, CRY was started by Rippan Kapur who dreamt of ensuring happier childhoods for India‚Äôs children. Rippan chose to build CRY as an institution that not only inspired India‚Äôs citizens to discover their potential for action and contribute to the solution but also empowered local NGOs with the funds as well as the technical know-how to create lasting impact on the ground. Rippan Kapur passed away in 1994. CRY participated in the ‚ÄòVoice Of India‚Äô campaign, as a part of the National Alliance for the Fundamental Right to Education (NAFRE), to propose a constitutional amendment to the government for free and compulsory education to all children. As a result of the ‚ÄòVoice of India‚Äô campaign, NAFRE contributed towards bringing in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

He was one of the founders of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He is best remembered for his role in uncovering the 1919 \\"Black Sox\\" Scandal. Studs Terkel played Fullerton in the film Eight Men Out. Biography Fullerton was born in Ohio and attended the Ohio State University. Fullerton reportedly never graduated from Ohio State. He was kicked out for unknown reasons (he never explained to his family). He was later honored by the university for his writing. After starting in Cincinnati, he moved to Chicago to continue his career in journalism. Fullerton wrote in a colorful style, including slang and human interest elements for the first time in sports journalism. In fact, he is credited as the first writer to include quotes from players in sports coverage. Among his prot√©g√©s were Ring Lardner and Grantland Rice. Fullerton, however, was also adept at the details of the game of baseball, and made strong use of the predictive power of baseball statistics. He made a name for himself by predicting that the weak-hitting Chicago White Sox would upset the crosstown-rival Chicago Cubs in 1906 World Series. The Cubs had won 116 games that season and were favored to win; the White Sox had batted an anemic .230 with only seven home runs. The White Sox won the Series, four games to two. Black Sox Scandal Fullerton's prestige made him a powerful voice blowing the whistle on the Black Sox Scandal. Prior to the 1919 World Series between the White Sox and the Cincinnati Reds, Fullerton received a tip from professional gamblers that the Cincinnati team was a lock to win. The scene immortalized in the 1988 film Eight Men Out indicated that Fullerton (portrayed by Studs Terkel) watched the series with the legendary Ring Lardner (played by director John Sayles) and together they counted suspicious plays. In actuality, Fullerton did this with former pitching great Christy Mathewson. Fullerton's article for The Evening World, headlined \\"Is Big League Baseball Being Run for Gamblers, with Ballplayers in the Deal?\\", Library of Congress, Chronicling America. forced the baseball establishment to investigate the charges. One year later, the eight White Sox ballplayers who participated in, or knew of, the plot to throw the series were banned from the game for life. Personal life Fullerton with dog, 1912 Fullerton was also famous for writing stories about his hometown of Hillsboro, Ohio. He died on December 27, 1945, in Dunedin, Florida. Fullerton was posthumously awarded the J. G. Taylor Spink Award by the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964.1963 J.G. Taylor Spink Award Winner Hugh Fullerton, National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum Hugh Fullerton IV (also known as Hugh Fullerton Jr.,Early writing by son Hugh Fullerton, Jr., age 9, 1914 1904‚Äì1965) was a reporter and columnist for the Associated Press.

After the abbey's dissolution in 1782 the church, now a parish church, was the seat of the short-lived Bishopric of Leoben. History The nunnery was founded in 1004 by Adula or Adela of Leoben, wife of Count Aribo I, and her son, also called Aribo, the future Archbishop of Mainz, on the family's ancestral lands, and was settled by canonesses from Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg. The first abbess was Kunigunde, sister of Archbishop Aribo. It was made an Imperial abbey by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1020. The Benedictine Rule was introduced in the 12th century. G√∂ss Abbey functioned for centuries as a centre for the Styrian aristocracy to have their daughters educated and if necessary accommodated, and entry was strictly limited to members of the nobility. The nunnery, the last remaining Imperial abbey on Habsburg lands, was dissolved in 1782 in the course of the rationalist reforms of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, and from 1786 served for a short time as the seat of the newly founded Bishopric of Leoben, of which the former abbey church, dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Andrew, was the cathedral. The first and only bishop died in 1800, and from 1808 the diocese was administered by the Bishops of Seckau until it was formally abolished in 1859. In 1827 the premises were auctioned off and acquired by the wheelwrights' co-operative of Vordernberg, who were primarily interested in the forests of the former abbey's estates. In 1860 the buildings were acquired by a brewer from Graz (the nunnery had had its own brewer since 1459) and have since then been used as a brewery, the Brauerei G√∂√ü. Buildings and contents The former abbey church, briefly the cathedral of Leoben, is now used as a parish church. It is a large late Gothic building containing an early Romanesque crypt beneath the choir, some important early Gothic frescoes in the chapel of Saint Michael in the Zackenstil or \\"zigzag style\\", and an imposing roof. The famous G√∂ss chasuble (G√∂√üer Ornat), a valuable piece of Romanesque silk embroidery, is now preserved in the Museum f√ºr angewandte Kunst in Vienna. Now lost are the former parish church, the graveyard and the buildings formerly to the west of the abbey church. The Brunnh√∂fl (\\"fountain courtyard\\"), still largely extant, is well known. A curiosity on display in the premises is a rare specimen of a reusable coffin of 1784 with an opening bottom that deposited the bodies inside into a common grave. A product of Josephine rationalism, the intention was to save local authorities the expense of coffins in pauper funerals, but it was a deeply unpopular measure and the coffins were withdrawn after only a few months.see :de:Josephinischer Gemeindesarg  Abbesses of G√∂ss  *Kunigund I, 1020‚Äì1027 *Wilburgis, 1040 *Richardis, 1066 *Margaretha, sometime in the 2nd half of the 11th century *Hemma, sometime between 1100 and 1146 *Adelheid of Spanheim, 1146‚Äì1177 *Ottilie I of Guttenberg, 1188‚Äì1203 *Ottilie II, 1203‚Äì1230 *Kunigund II, 1239‚Äì1269 *Herburgis von Ehrenfels, 1271‚Äì1283 *Euphemia, 1283‚Äì1298 *Herradis von Breitenfurt, 1298‚Äì1322 *Berta von Pux und Pranckh, 1322‚Äì1338 *Diemut, 1340‚Äì1349 *Katharina von Strettweg, 1349‚Äì1354 *Gertraut von Hannau, 1355‚Äì1372 *Katharina von Truthan, 1381‚Äì1398 *Aloisia von Herberstorf, 1399‚Äì1421 *Gertrud von Helfenberg, 1421‚Äì1428 *Anna von Herberstorf, 1428‚Äì1463 *Bennigna Grassler, 1470‚Äì1474 *Ursula von Silberberg, 1474‚Äì1497 *Margaretha von Harbach, 1497‚Äì1505 *Veronika von Ratmanstorf, 1505‚Äì1514 *Margaretha von Mindorf, 1514‚Äì1523 *Barbara von Spangstein, 1523‚Äì1543 *Amalia von Leisser, 1543‚Äì1566 *Barbara von Liechtenstein, 1566‚Äì1573 *Anna von Harrach, 1573‚Äì1576 *Florientina von Putterer, 1576‚Äì1602 *Regina von Schrattenbach, 1602‚Äì1611 *Margaretha von Kuenburg, 1611‚Äì1640 *Maria Johanna von Kollonitsch, 1640‚Äì1657 *Maria Benedikta von Schrattenbach, 1657‚Äì1695 *Katharina Benedikta von St√ºrgkh, 1695‚Äì1706 *Maria Mechthildis von Berchthold, 1706‚Äì1737 *Maria Antonia von √úberacker, 1737‚Äì1751 *Maria Henrica von Poppen, 1751‚Äì1779 *Maria Gabriela von Schaffmann, 1779‚Äì1782 NotesExternal links * Bundesdenkmalamt (BDA): Stift G√∂ss Category:Benedictine monasteries in Austria Category:Monasteries in Styria Category:1004 establishments in Europe Category:Christian monasteries established in the 11th century Category:Religious organizations established in the 1000s Category:Benedictine nunneries in Austria Category:Tourist attractions in Styria Category:1020s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1020 establishments in Europe Category:1782 disestablishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Austria ","title":"G√∂ss Abbey"},{"id":"10831407","text":"Vychegodsky () is an urban locality (a work settlement) under the administrative jurisdiction of the town of oblast significance of Kotlas in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia.

He was the 13th Speaker of the House of Representatives, from 1950 to 1957. Early life Oram was born in 1885 at Christchurch. His mother was May Eltham, originally from Hobart in Tasmania. His father, Matthew Henry Oram, died three months before Matthew Oram's birth. His formal education started at age 12, as he went to live with his aunt in Wellington after his mother's death. He attended Wellington College (1898‚Äì1904), followed by Victoria University of Wellington (1905‚Äì1911). He graduated BA (1908) and received a Sir George Grey Scholarship (he came equal in the examinations with Miss Barkas, but as she had also won and accepted another scholarship, Oram was given the Sir George Grey Scholarship), and then graduated MA (Hons) (maths and physics, 1909) and LLB (1912). During his education, he competed in athletics. He belonged to Victoria's debating society and won prizes (Plunket Medal for Oratory and the Joint Challenge Scroll and Union Prize). He was also a member of the Territorial Force. He formed a partnership with John Mason and practised law in Palmerston North from 1912 or 1913. He also lectured in law at Victoria. On 5 March 1913, he married Margarette Ann Florence Johnson at St John's Church, Wellington. She was the daughter of Captain Johnson, the harbour master; John Mason was best man. When New Zealand declared war against Germany in 1914, Oram sold his law practice and joined the army. He was declared unfit for overseas service and served first in Palmerston North, and then at Base Records in Wellington, where he attained the rank of Captain. He was awarded an MBE (military) in 1919. Life post World War I After the war, he returned to practising law in Palmerston North. He also owned a farm in the Manawatu. Oram was instrumental in the establishment of Palmerston North as a flying hub for the North Island. He obtained his pilot's licence in the 1920s and became the first president of the Manawatu Aero Club. He promoted that the club compete in the handicap section of the MacRobertson Air Race and paid half the entry fee, but ceased to support the event when his nominated pilot was not chosen. Oram supported multiple groups. He was involved in setting up the Palmerston North branch of YMCA and was their chairman for seven years. He was involved in establishing the local debating club, and helped form the competitions society. He helped establish the Manawatu Repertory Society and was involved in their annual productions for two decades. He chaired this group for five years (1935‚Äì1940) and was later chairman of the New Zealand Players board. One of his main interests was in education. He was on the board of Palmerston North Boys' High School for 29 years, 14 years of that as chairman. He served on the Wanganui Education Board for over a decade. In 1937, he was appointed to the Victoria University College Council and a year later, he joined the Massey Agricultural College council; he held both positions until 1950. He was chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Palmerston North. Oram owned race horses, and in 1955, Golden Galleon won the Wellington Cup. Political career 29th Parliament, with Oram as newly elected Speaker walking behind the Serjeant-at-Arms (with mace) Oram was on the Palmerston North Borough Council (1920‚Äì1927). In the , he was a candidate of the anti-Labour Democrat Party in the electorate. The Democrats stood 50 candidates in the 1935 election, but none of them were successful. Their main effect was to split the vote on the right, resulting in several electorates going to Labour. This may well have happened in Manawatu, where Labour's Lorrie Hunter unseated Reform's Joseph Linklater by a margin of just 30 votes (2,962 votes versus 2,932), with Oram coming fourth (673 votes). In 1936, the Democrats merged with other parties to form the National Party, contributing the most conservative perspective. Oram did not stand in the . When John Cobbe retired from Parliament in 1943, Oram won National's nomination for the Manawatu electorate. He beat Labour's candidate, Corporal W. H. Oliver, by a considerable margin (6,194 votes versus 3,883), with an Independent coming a distant third. Oram held the Manawatu electorate until his retirement in 1957. During his first two parliamentary terms, when the Labour Party was in government, Oram was a frequent debater and advocated for better education. When National came to power in the , many expected Oram to become Minister of Education. However, the portfolio was given to Ronald Algie, who held it until 1957. Oram had a strained relationship with Sidney Holland, the Prime Minister, was considered too conservative and together with a sometimes difficult personality, these factors may not have worked in his favour. When Parliament first assembled after the election in June 1950, Oram was elected Speaker of the House. He held the role of Speaker until his retirement from Parliament on 29 October 1957. He executed the role in a fair and effective way. In the 1952 Queen's Birthday Honours, during his time as Speaker, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor. Later life Oram was president of the Constitutional Society. Their aims were for more open government, tax reform, the re-establishment on an upper house, and a written constitution. None of these campaigns had much success, and he retired from the society in 1968. Oram died on 22 January 1969 at Palmerston North, survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons. His son, also Matthew Oram, went to England in 1938 to study actuarial science. His grandson, also named Matthew Oram and based in Hong Kong, shares his hobby and has racehorses.

It was released in Germany and in the United States in 1997. The film is based on Stories for Children by Isaac Bashevis Singer. Plot After creating the world, God has three cherubs spread intelligence, wisdom, and foolishness over the world. The third cherub accidentally drops all the foolishness on the village of Chelm, so that everyone in the village is very dumb. A recently orphaned boy named Aaron moves to Chelm to live with his uncle Shlemiel, while Darko, an evil sorcerer, plans to create a golem to destroy Chelm, but needs the Book of Marvels to bring the golem to life. Shlemiel's family is poor so he asks the mayor, Gronam, for a raise. Gronam instead tells him to marry off his three daughters, which will make him rich, while Shlemiel's wife, Sarah, tells Aaron to sell his goat, Zlateh, who cannot make milk. Darko's fox listens in on Shlemiel's plan to marry off his daughters, so Darko poses as a female matchmaker and offers three nonexistent rich husbands to Shlemiel in exchange for the Book of Marvels. When Shlemiel refuses, Darko reveals his true identity and angrily causes a blizzard. While Aaron and Zlateh take shelter from the storm inside a haystack, an imp called the Lantuch is blown inside, hitting Aaron in the head and getting mild amnesia, causing him to forget his spells. When he tries to use a spell to find the biscuits Aaron lost, it instead gives Zlateh the ability to make milk, causing his family to keep her when he returns. Shlemiel informs Gronam that a sorcerer is after the Book of Marvels, and Gronam entrusts the Book to Shlemiel. Darko instructs his fox to spy on Shlemiel and inform him where he hides the Book of Marvels. Shlemiel hides it in the cupboard that Gronam originally took it from, and hides the key in his shoe. When Shlemiel falls asleep on his way to Warsaw to find husbands for his daughters, he points his shoes in the direction of Warsaw to remember which way to go when he wakes up. The fox steals the key from his shoe, and mischievously points the shoes back toward Chelm. After receiving the key, Darko steals the Book of Marvels. Falling for the fox's trick, Shlemiel goes back the way he came, and when he arrives back at Chelm, he thinks that it is a second version of the village. Everyone but Aaron believes this as well. Darko returns to his castle, brings the golem to life, and orders it to destroy Chelm. The golem destroys all the buildings in Chelm except the synagogue because it is sacred, much to the sorcerer's anger. Gronam says that if the golem lives past the Sabbath, it will live forever, and the world will be destroyed. Because the way to kill a golem is written in the Book of Marvels, Aaron goes to Darko's castle with Zlateh and the Lantuch to find the Book. As Aaron reads the information he needs, confirming that what Gronam said was true, the Lantuch accidentally alerts Darko while casting a spell. Darko takes the Book of Marvels back, but Zlateh attacks him, causing the Book to fall into the fire. As Aaron, Zlateh, and the Lantuch escape the castle, Darko sends the golem after them, but the golem has a change of heart due to Aaron's courage and refuses to harm him, even protecting him from Darko's attack. The Lantuch is hit on the head by a rock, regains his memory, and turns Darko to stone. Though reluctant to kill the golem after his latest action, Aaron does so by erasing a symbol on his head to save the world. With Chelm destroyed, all its inhabitants leave to find new homes somewhere else, with Shlemiel and his family intending to go to \\"Chelm #1\\".

He was one of the earliest proponents of a citizen's income or guaranteed minimum income, preceding even the \\"state bonus\\" scheme published by British Dennis Milner (1892‚Äì1956) in 1920. Charlier was influenced by Charles Fourier. According to John Stuart Mill, Fourierism required that \\"in the distribution, a certain minimum is first assigned for the subsistence of every member of the community, whether capable or not of labour.\\" Fourier and his foremost disciple Victor Prosper Consid√©rant criticized civilization for failing to provide a minimum to the poor, but feared widespread idleness and a collapsing civilization if workers previously depending on \\"repugnant\\" labor for income had a choice. Consid√©rant, in some of his writings, suggested that society guarantee a right to work in order to compensate them for denying equal access to natural resources. (\\"La condition sine qu√¢ non-pour la L√©gitimit√© de la Propri√©t√© est donc que la Soci√©t√© reconnaisse au Prol√©taire le droit au travail et qu‚Äôelle lui assure au moins autant de moyens de subsistance, pour un exercice d‚Äôactivit√© donn√©, que cet exercice e√ªt pu lui en procurer dans l‚Äô√âtat primitif.\\") Charlier agreed with Fourierism that the central problem was the improvement of the condition of the disinherited classes (\\"am√©lioration du sort des classes d√©sh√©rit√©es\\"). He rejected \\"the right to assistance\\", a solution addressing effects rather than the cause, and the \\"right to work/organization of labor\\" which he expected to result in an extension of state control. Instead, Charlier proposed a scheme with a basic income paid unconditionally to every member of society, regardless of need or ability to work. In 1896 at age 80, Charlier died at Brussels where he was born.

He was born in Clark County, Kentucky. He pursued preparatory studies and studied law. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Elkton, Kentucky. Bristow was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives 1831‚Äì1833. Later, he served in the Kentucky Senate in 1846 and was a delegate to the Kentucky constitutional convention in 1849. He was elected as a Whig to the Thirty-third United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Presley Underwood Ewing and served from December 4, 1854, to March 3, 1855 and was elected as a candidate of the Opposition Party to the Thirty-sixth United States Congress (March 4, 1859 ‚Äì March 3, 1861). He was not a candidate for reelection in 1860. Bristow organized and served as the first secretary of the Green River Female Academy, a notable female academy located in Todd County, Kentucky. Bristow influenced the mission of the school, which under his guidance, established equal opportunities for women to study advanced mathematics and sciences, subjects typically reserved for men during the time period. After leaving Congress, he resumed the practice of law. Bristow was a member of the House Committee of Thirty-three appointed by the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in December 1860 to consider proposals to avert the impending disaster and also attended the peace convention of 1861 held in Washington, D.C. in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending American Civil War. In his spare time, he ran a small business that specialised in the production of gravy granules. He died in Elkton, Kentucky in 1864 and is buried in the family burying ground.

The adults are small ( in), shiny, black beetles. Newly emerged adults are pale-brown to almost white. They eventually turn black with a brown head. The eggs are 0.2 mm long, clear and twice as long as they are wide. The elongate larvae are pale yellow. Life cycle Female beetles live for about 2 months, during which time they lay 3 to 4 eggs per day; male beetles live for 1¬Ω months. The females generally lay their eggs within clusters of whitefly eggs, which makes it easier for the young larvae to find a food source. Each instar lasts 1¬Ω‚Äì3 days. D. pusillus pupates on lower leaves, in leaf litter, or in other protected locations, often in groups. The pupal stage lasts approximately 6 days. Development from egg to adult takes approximately 3 weeks at 80‚Äì85 ¬∞F.  Use in biocontrol  Both larvae and adults are active predators that can consume numerous eggs or nymphs each day. An adult Delphastus takes no longer than half a minute to handle a whitefly egg, and devours up to 160 eggs or 12 large nymphs daily. A larva consumes 1000 whitefly eggs (less if it also eats whitefly nymphs) during its entire development. Adults and larvae feed by piercing the insect with their mouthparts and alternately sucking and regurgitating the internal contents to digest and consume it. Adult females feed more on eggs and first instars than on later stages. They are strong fliers that will migrate to areas that contain high densities of whiteflies. D. pusillus is most effective at high whitefly densities. Since adult female beetles must feed on over 200 eggs per day in order to reproduce, it may be of limited benefit in greenhouses where whitefly populations are low. Both adult and larval beetles avoid feeding on whitefly nymphs parasitised by wasps such as Encarsia formosa and Eretmocerus eremicus when the wasps are in later stages of development.

Aphidoletes aphidimyza  Description  The adults are small (less than long), black, delicate flies (similar to a fungus gnat) that live for an average of 10 days, feeding on aphid honeydew. They hide beneath the leaves during the day, and are active at night.  Life cycle  Females deposit 100-250 tiny () shiny orange eggs singly or in small groups among aphid colonies that hatch in 2‚Äì3 days. After 3‚Äì7 days the larvae drop to the ground and burrow inches into the soil to pupate. They are most effective at and high relative humidity.  Behavior  The small, bright orange, slug-like larvae inject a toxin into aphids' leg joints to paralyze them and then suck out the aphid body contents through a hole bitten in the thorax. Larvae can consume aphids much larger than themselves and may kill many more aphids than they eat when aphid populations are high. A single larva grows up to long and kills 4-65 aphids per day.  Use in biological pest control  The aphid midge is commercially grown by insectaries for use as biological pest control in commercial greenhouse crops. It is supplied as pupae in trays or bottles containing a moist substrate such as vermiculite or peat moss for the pupae to complete their development. Once they are placed in the greenhouse they usually emerge from the shipping container as adults to begin egg-laying in 3‚Äì7 days depending on temperature.

Larvae have black heads, gray-green bodies with white undersides, and are about 15‚Äì18 mm long when full grown. Larvae occur in groups and characteristically curl their bodies upward in a \\"J\\" shape when disturbed. In the spring when larch trees are leafed out and the new growth is expanding, the female sawfly can be seen depositing eggs in new shoots near the branch tips. Damage symptoms Egg-laying causes shoots to curl as they grow. Larvae occur in groups or clumps and are very obvious when present. Defoliation is rarely complete but trees can appear very thin crowned. Most trees are very tolerant of defoliation and trees generally recover during the summer, however severe defoliation over several years can weaken the trees causing them to be less likely to survive a harsh winter. Life cycle Winter is spent in the soil as a prepupa. Adults emerge in late spring and females lay eggs in elongating shoots. Larvae feed on needles for 3‚Äì4 weeks, generally in late June and early July. However, emergence can be delayed for some individuals larva can be present throughout the summer.

The genus Saccharopolyspora was discovered in 1985 in isolates from crushed sugarcane. The bacteria produce yellowish- pink aerial hyphae, with bead-like chains of spores enclosed in a characteristic hairy sheath. This genus is defined as aerobic, Gram-positive, nonacid-fast actinomycetes with fragmenting substrate mycelium. S. spinosa was isolated from soil collected inside a nonoperational sugar mill rum still in the Virgin Islands. Spinosad is a mixture of chemical compounds in the spinosyn family that has a generalized structure consisting of a unique tetracyclic ring system attached to an amino sugar (D-forosamine) and a neutral sugar (tri-Œü-methyl-L-rhamnose). Spinosad is relatively nonpolar and not easily dissolved in water. Spinosad is a novel mode-of-action insecticide derived from a family of natural products obtained by fermentation of S. spinosa. Spinosyns occur in over 20 natural forms, and over 200 synthetic forms (spinosoids) have been produced in the lab. Spinosad contains a mix of two spinosoids, spinosyn A, the major component, and spinosyn D (the minor component), in a roughly 17:3 ratio. Mode of action Spinosad is highly active, by both contact and ingestion, in numerous insect species. Its overall protective effect varies with insect species and life stage. It affects certain species only in the adult stage, but can affect other species at more than one life stage. The species subject to very high rates of mortality as larvae, but not as adults, may gradually be controlled through sustained larval mortality. The mode of action of spinosoid insecticides is by a neural mechanism. The spinosyns and spinosoids have a novel mode of action, primarily targeting binding sites on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of the insect nervous system that are distinct from those at which other insecticides have their activity. Spinosoid binding leads to disruption of acetylcholine neurotransmission. Spinosad also has secondary effects as a Œ≥-amino-butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter agonist. It kills insects by hyperexcitation of the insect nervous system. Spinosad so far has proven not to cause cross- resistance to any other known insecticide. Use Spinosad has been used around the world for the control of a variety of insect pests, including Lepidoptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Hymenoptera, and many others. It was first registered as a pesticide in the United States for use on crops in 1997. Its labeled use rate is set at 1 ppm (1 mg a.i./kg of grain) and its maximum residue limit (MRL) or tolerance is set at 1.5 ppm. Spinosad's widespread commercial launch was deferred, awaiting final MRL or tolerance approvals in a few remaining grain-importing countries. It is considered a natural product, thus is approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous nations. Two other uses for spinosad are for pets and humans. Spinosad has recently been used in oral preparations (as Comfortis) to treat C. felis, the cat flea, in canines and felines; the optimal dose set for canines is reported to be 30 mg/kg. Spinosad is sold under the trade names, Comfortis, Trifexis, and Natroba. Trifexis also includes milbemycin oxime. Comfortis and Trifexis brands treat adult fleas on pets; the latter also prevents heartworm disease. Natroba is sold for treatment of human head lice. Spinosad is also commonly used to kill thrips. Spinosyn A Spinosyn A does not appear to interact directly with known insecticidal-relevant target sites, but rather acts via a novel mechanism. Spinosyn A resembles a GABA antagonist and is comparable to the effect of avermectin on insect neurons. Spinosyn A is highly active against neonate larvae of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, and is slightly more biologically active than spinosyn D. In general, spinosyns possessing a methyl group at C6 (spinosyn D-related analogs) tend to be more active and less affected by changes in the rest of the molecule. Spinosyn A is slow to penetrate to the internal fluids of larvae; it is also poorly metabolized once it enters the insect. The apparent lack of spinosyn A metabolism may contribute to its high level of activity, and may compensate for the slow rate of penetration. Safety and ecotoxicology Spinosad has high efficacy, a broad insect pest spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, and a good environmental profile, a unique feature of the insecticide compared to others currently used for the protection of grain products. It is regarded as natural product-based, and approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous national and international certifications. Spinosad residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years. Ecotoxicology parameters have been reported for spinosad, and are: * in rat (Rattus norvegicus Bergenhout, 1769), acute oral: >5000 mg/kg (nontoxic) * in rat (R. norvegicus), acute dermal: LD50 >2000 mg/kg (nontoxic) * in California quail (Callipepla californica Shaw, 1798), oral toxicity: LD50 >2000 mg/kg (nontoxic) * in duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica Linnaeus, 1758), dietary toxicity: LC50 >5000 mg/kg (nontoxic) * in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792), LC50-96h = 30.0 mg/l (slightly toxic) * in Honeybee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758), LD50 = 0.0025 mg/bee (highly toxic if directly sprayed on and of dried residues). Chronic exposure studies failed to induce tumor formation in rats and mice; mice given up to 51 mg/kg/day for 18 months resulted in no tumor formation.

They are among the most common insect pests affecting Birch trees (Betula spp.) in North America. Areas inside the leaves are consumed by the larvae, affecting the leaves' ability to produce food. Yearly browning of birch leaves are noticed in mid July and August, but the leafminers have been feeding inside the leaf tissue since early spring. Life cycle Leafminers overwinter in the soil as prepupae. Adults emerge in May to late June to early July, depending on temperature and humidity. Oviposition (egg-laying) peaks during the last week of June. Adult birch leafminers are small (about 1/8 to 1/4 inch long), black and fly like. Females deposit their eggs singly in slits cut in the central areas of young leaves, usually near the tips of branches. More than one female may lay eggs in a leaf. The eggs hatch into legless, worm-like larvae. These immature larvae feed individually between the leaf surfaces, creating blotchy kidney shaped mines. The immature leafminers feed for several weeks, then drop to the ground where they enter the soil layer to develop into pupae. They pupate and remain there until the following spring. After overwintering as prepupae in the soil below the tree, the adults emerge just as the birch trees are leafed out. Adults are almost all females. Damage The areas of leaves that are consumed by the amber marked birch leafminer larva turn brown. Because people often do not see the early signs of birch leafminer feeding, it often appears the tree has suddenly dried up or become diseased. This browning is caused by the outer layers of the leaf drying out after the leaf miner larva has consumed the green tissue between the outer layers of the leaf. Early mines appear as light green or whitish discolorations on the leaves. Larvae sometimes can be seen easily when leaves are held up to sunlight, especially as the mines and larvae grow larger. Feeding over several weeks causes the blemish to take on a blister-like appearance. A single leaf can contain as many as 40 larvae whose mines may merge to destroy the total photosynthetic area of the leaf. Heavy infestations of leafminer larvae can seriously affect a tree's photosynthetic capacity. Repeated attacks will generally cause stress which may induce susceptibility of the tree to other injurious agents. Species responsible There are two species mainly responsible for defoliation and browning of birch trees in the United States and Canada. In Northern forests, it is the amber-marked birch leaf miner, Profenusa thomsoni, which were accidentally introduced from Europe to North America early in the 1900s. The other is the birch leafminer, Fenusa pumila, which is more common in Eastern forests. Biological control Presently there is no commercially available biological control agent to control Amber marked birch leafminers, however Canadian trees in the Edmonton area have been successfully controlled with releases of a parasitic wasp, Lathrolestes luteolator. Populations of the tiny parasitoid wasp selectively attack the most damaging birch leafmining pest (Profenusa thomsoni) have developed and drastically reduced the problem in the Edmonton area of Canada. Following trials in 1995 that supported a dramatic reduction in birch leafminer damage by the first parasitoid, the City of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada discontinued pesticide treatments to almost 3,500 city birch trees in 1996 and 1997. These trees continue to show very little leafminer damage without any treatment. Chemical control Spinosad can be used to control birch leafminers prior to extensive damage. Spinosad is a new chemical class of insecticides derived from a soil dwelling bacterium discovered in 1982. It is considered practically non-toxic to humans, pets, and beneficial insects. Unlike other insecticides, Spinosad will not harm beneficial insects including the Amber Marked Leafminer parasite. Horticultural oil applications applied at the right time may help kill eggs or tiny larvae within the leaf tissue. Oil applications should be made as soon as adults have emerged in the spring and egg laying has occurred and should continue weekly until mid June. Pesticides made with botanical plant oils may be especially useful to prevent egg laying. Neem oil acts as a repellent and may interfere with the egg laying activity of female leaf miners. Systemic insecticides are chemical pesticides that are absorbed into the tissues of plants. These pesticides make the entire plant, or parts of the plant, poisonous to insects that feed on the plant tissue. Most systemics are very toxic to people and pets. Trunk injections are confined to the tree's cambium layer, where it is carried to the leaf tissue by the movement of the tree's sap.

They can use at least 15 species of whitefly as a host, including Bemisia tabaci and Aleyrodes proletella. The tiny females (about 0.6 mm long) are black with a yellow abdomen and opalescent wings. This species reproduces asexually via thelytoky induced by Wolbachia infection. Males are produced only rarely. They are slightly larger than females and are completely black in coloration.  Life cycle  Diagram illustrating the life cycles of Greenhouse whitefly and its parasitoid wasp Encarsia formosa Tomato leaf with whitefly nymphs (white) parasitized by E. formosa (black). Females deposit 50-100 eggs individually inside the bodies of nymphs or pupae of the host species. The wasp larvae develop through four instars in about two weeks at optimum temperatures. Parasitized greenhouse whitefly pupae turn black in about 10 days, while parasitized sweet potato whiteflies turn amber brown. Both are easily distinguished from unparasitized host pupae. Wasp pupation occurs within the whitefly body. Adult wasps emerge about 10 days later. Use in biological control Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid, is sold commercially for biological control of whitefly, an insect pest of tomato and other horticultural crops. Encarsia formosa has been used as a natural pesticide to control whitefly populations in greenhouses since the 1920s. Use of the insect fell out of fashion due to the increased prevalence of chemical pesticides and was essentially non-existent by the 1940s. Since the 1970s E. formosa has seen something of a revival, with renewed usage in European and Russian greenhouses. In some countries, such as New Zealand, it is the primary biological control agent used to control greenhouse whiteflies, particularly on crops such as tomato, a particularly difficult plant for predators to establish on.Bioforce Limited, New Zealand  Flight  E. formosa makes use of an unusual form of hovering flight.

He was a centre for the Australian national team in one Test in 1948 in which he captained the side. Club career Born in Lismore in northern New South Wales he played for Bowraville and Coffs Harbour and in Country representative sides. He joined Wests Newcastle in 1938. He came to Sydney in 1940 for one season with the St George Dragons. After World War II he played for the Western Suburbs Magpies for a season, then returned to Newcastle to captain-coach Wests Newcastle in 1946-47 before another two Sydney seasons with the Magpies in 1948-49. War service He spent three years from 1942 -1945 in the RAAF as a leading aircraftmen and appeared in a number of armed forces rugby league exhibition matches. Representative career 1948 was the sole year of Maxwell's controversial representative career. His only state appearance for New South Wales was in the first match of that year's interstate series against Queensland. When the Australian Test side was chosen for the domestic series against New Zealand Maxwell was named as a reserve back and did not figure in the Tests. He had been dropped from the New South Wales squad before the end of the interstate series and on the night the Kangaroo Tour side was announced Maxwell wasn't in Sydney with the other representative hopefuls having already left on a train bound for Newcastle. Inexplicably Maxwell was not only selected to the tour squad but was named captain and was expected to take on the duty of coaching the squad during the tour of England and France. Whilst Maxwell was a reliable centre whose career had been interrupted by the war and injuries the mystery concerned how the incumbent Test captain Len Smith who one week earlier had led the Kangaroos to victory over New Zealand was suddenly not good enough to fit into the 28 man touring squad. Theories abounded regarding either religious bigotry from the selectors or coaching politics. See Selection controversy in Len Smith. Due to injury and illness Maxwell did not play in the first Test loss against Great Britain at Leeds. He played in 11 minor tour matches and captained Australia in the second Test at Swinton which Great Britain won 16-7. Although Maxwell was a popular captain on Tour the match results were not good. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No.262.ARL Annual Report 2005 He did not represent at state or national level again. Maxwell's final seasons were as captain-coach of Maitland from 1950 -1952. After football, he ran a newsagency.

It is a private school located on Gifft Hill.  History  The school was founded by Scott Crawford and Sabrina Bobert and opened in 2000 as The Coral Bay School located in the Lumber Yard complex in Cruz Bay. It was the first independent middle school and high school, enrolling 13 students between grades 7-9th. Grades were subsequently added each year until they had their first graduating class in 2004. By 2004, the school had enrolled 85 students. In the fall semester of 2004, the school changed its name to The St. John School on Gifft Hill and merged with Pine Peace Elementary School. In addition, 8 acres of land were donated to the school on Gifft Hill nearly next door to the pine peace school. In the fall semester of 2005, the school moved to new location. However, only the gym was completed and was then partitioned to make classrooms. In this building were grades 7-12; and the elementary school remained down the road from the upper campus. The name of the school was officially changed, again, to the Gifft Hill School. In the fall of 2006, Crawford and Bobert stepped down and Ben Biddle took over as headmaster of the school. While headmaster, the school started an organic school store. The fifth and sixth grades also moved to the upper campus that year bringing the population at the upper campus to 74 students. In 2009, an additional 4 acres were donated to the school which officially joined the two campus of the school. There is a new athletic field on campus that is used by the school for sports and other activities.

Proper sanitation is needed to maintain the visual clarity of water and to prevent the transmission of infectious waterborne diseases. Methods Two distinct and separate methods are employed in the sanitation of a swimming pool. The filtration system removes organic waste on a daily basis by using the sieve baskets inside the skimmer and circulation pump and the sand unit with a backwash facility for easy removal of organic waste from the water circulation. Disinfection normally in the form of Hypochlorous acid (HClO) kills infectious microorganisms. Alongside these two distinct measures within the pool owners jurisdiction, swimmer hygiene and cleanliness helps reduce organic waste build-up. Guidelines The World Health Organization has published international guidelines for the safety of swimming pools and similar recreational-water environments, including standards for minimizing microbial and chemical hazards. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides information on pool sanitation and water related illnesses for health professionals and the public. The main organizations providing certifications for pool and spa operators and technicians are the National Swimming Pool Foundation and Association of Pool & Spa Professionals. The certifications are accepted by many state and local health departments. Contaminants and disease Swimming pool contaminants are introduced from environmental sources and swimmers. Affecting primarily outdoor swimming pools, environmental contaminants include windblown dirt and debris, incoming water from unsanitary sources, rain containing microscopic algae spores and droppings from birds possibly harboring disease-causing pathogens. Indoor pools are less susceptible to environmental contaminants. Contaminants introduced by swimmers can dramatically influence the operation of indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Sources include micro-organisms from infected swimmers and body oils including sweat, cosmetics, suntan lotion, urine, saliva and fecal matter; for example, it was estimated by researchers that swimming pools contain, on average, 30 to 80 mL of urine for each person that uses the pool. In addition, the interaction between disinfectants and pool water contaminants can produce a mixture of chloramines and other disinfection by-products. The journal Environmental Science & Technology reported that sweat and urine react with chlorine and produce trichloramine and cyanogen chloride, two chemicals dangerous to human health. Nitrosamines are another type of the disinfection by-products that are of concern as a potential health hazard. Acesulfame potassium is widely used in the human diet and excreted by the kidneys. It has been used by researchers as a marker to estimate to what degree swimming pools are contaminated by urine. It was estimated that a commercial-size swimming pool of 220,000 gallons would contain about 20 gallons of urine, equivalent to about 2 gallons of urine in a typical residential pool. Pathogenic contaminants are of greatest concern in swimming pools as they have been associated with numerous recreational water illnesses (RWIs). Public health pathogens can be present in swimming pools as viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi. Diarrhea is the most commonly reported illness associated with pathogenic contaminants, while other diseases associated with untreated pools are Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis. Other illnesses commonly occurring in poorly maintained swimming pools include otitis externa, commonly called swimmers ear, skin rashes and respiratory infections. Maintenance and hygiene Contamination can be minimized by good swimmer hygiene practices such as showering before and after swimming, and not letting children with intestinal disorders swim. Effective treatments are needed to address contaminants in pool water because preventing the introduction of pool contaminants, pathogenic and non-pathogenic, into swimming pools is impossible. A well-maintained, properly operating pool filtration and re- circulation system is the first barrier in combating contaminants large enough to be filtered. Rapid removal of filterable contaminants reduces the impact on the disinfection system thereby limiting the formation of chloramines, restricting the formation of disinfection by-products and optimizing sanitation effectiveness. To kill pathogens and help prevent recreational water illnesses, pool operators must maintain proper levels of chlorine or another sanitizer. Over time, calcium from municipal water tends to accumulate, developing salt deposits in the swimming pool walls and equipment (filters, pumps), reducing their effectiveness. Therefore, it is advised to either completely drain the pool, and refill it with fresh water, or recycle the existing pool water, using reverse osmosis. The advantage of the latter method is that 90% of the water can be reused. Pool operators must also store and handle cleaning and sanitation chemicals safely. Prevention of diseases in swimming pools and spas Disease prevention should be the top priority for every water quality management program for pool and spa operators. Disinfection is critical to protect against pathogens, and is best managed through routine monitoring and maintenance of chemical feed equipment to ensure optimum chemical levels in accordance with state and local regulations. Modern digital equipment when used in conjunction with automatic chemical feeders results in stable pH and chlorine levelsHow To Raise Chlorine Levels In a Pool? \\"chlorine levels\\", Sage Bathrooms. Local jurisdiction may demand a wait time if chemicals are added by hand to the water so that swimmers are not injured. Chemical parameters include disinfectant levels according to regulated pesticide label directions. pH should be kept between 7.2‚Äì7.8. Human tears have a pH of 7.4, making this an ideal point to set a pool. More often than not, it is improper pH and not the sanitiser that is responsible for irritating swimmers' skin and eyes. Total alkalinity should be 80‚Äì120 ppm and calcium hardness between 200‚Äì400 ppm. Good hygienic behavior at swimming pools is also important for reducing health risk factors at swimming pools and spas. Showering before swimming can reduce introduction of contaminants to the pool, and showering again after swimming will help to remove any that way have been picked up by the swimmer. Those with diarrhea or other gastroenteritis illnesses should not swim within 2 weeks of an outbreak, especially children. Cryptosporidium is chlorine resistant. To minimize exposure to pathogens, swimmers should avoid getting water into their mouths and never swallow pool or spa water. Standards Maintaining an effective concentration of disinfectant is critically important in assuring the safety and health of swimming pool and spa users. When any of these pool chemicals are used, it is very important to keep the pH of the pool in the range 7.2 to 7.8 ‚Äì according to the Langelier Saturation Index, or 7.8 to 8.2 ‚Äì according to the Hamilton Index; higher pH drastically reduces the sanitizing power of the chlorine due to reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), while lower pH causes bather discomfort, especially to the eyes. However, according to the Hamilton Index, a higher pH can reduce unnecessary chlorine consumption while still remaining effective at preventing algae and bacteria growth. To help ensure the health of bathers and protect pool equipment, it is essential to perform routine monitoring of water quality factors (or \\"parameters\\") on a regular basis. This process becomes the essence of an optimum water quality management program. Systems and disinfection methods=Chlorine and bromine methods Conventional halogen-based oxidizers such as chlorine and bromine are convenient and economical primary sanitizers for swimming pools and provide a residual level of sanitizer that remains in the water. Chlorine-releasing compounds are the most popular and frequently used in swimming pools whereas bromine-releasing compounds have found heightened popularity in spas and hot tubs. Both are members of the halogen group with demonstrated ability to destroy and deactivate a wide range of potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses in swimming pools and spas. Both exhibit three essential elements as ideal first-line-of-defense sanitizers for swimming pools and spas: they are fast-acting and enduring, they are effective algaecides, and they oxidize undesired contaminants. Swimming pools can be disinfected with a variety of chlorine-releasing compounds. The most basic of these compounds is molecular chlorine (Cl2); however, its application is primarily in large commercial public swimming pools. Inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds frequently used in residential and public swimming pools include sodium hypochlorite commonly known as liquid bleach or simply bleach, calcium hypochlorite and lithium hypochlorite. Chlorine residuals from Cl2 and inorganic chlorine-releasing compounds break down rapidly in sunlight. To extend their disinfectant usefulness and persistence in outdoor settings, swimming pools treated with one or more of the inorganic forms of chlorine- releasing compounds can be supplemented with cyanuric acid ‚Äì a granular stabilizing agent capable of extending the active chlorine residual half-life (t¬Ω) by four to sixfold. Chlorinated isocyanurates, a family of organic chlorine-releasing compounds, are stabilized to prevent UV degradation due to the presence of cyanurate as part of their chemical backbone. These are commonly sold for general use in small summer pools, where the water is expected to be used for only a few months and is expected to be regularly topped up with fresh, due to evaporation and splash loss. It is important to change the water frequently, otherwise levels of cyanuric acid will build up to beyond the point at which the mechanism functions. Excess cyanurates will actually work in reverse and will inhibit the chlorine. A steadily lowering pH value of the water may at first be noticed. Algal growth may become visible, even though chlorine tests show sufficient levels. https://poolonomics.com/pool-chlorine/ Chlorine reacting with urea in urine and other nitrogen-containing wastes from bathers can produce chloramines. Chloramines typically occur when an insufficient amount of chlorine is used to disinfect a contaminated pool. Chloramines are generally responsible for the noxious, irritating smell prominently occurring in indoor pool settings. A common way to remove chloramines is to \\"superchlorinate\\" (commonly called \\"shocking\\") the pool with a high dose of inorganic chlorine sufficient to deliver 10 ppm chlorine. Regular superchlorination (every two weeks in summer) helps to eliminate these unpleasant odors in the pool. Levels of chloramines and other volatile compounds in water can be minimized by reducing contaminants that lead to their formation (e.g., urea, creatinine, amino acids and personal care products) as well as by use of non-chlorine \\"shock oxidizers\\" such as potassium peroxymonosulfate. Medium pressure UV technology is used to control the level of chloramines in indoor pools. It is also used as a secondary form of disinfection to address chlorine tolerant pathogens. A properly sized and maintained UV system should remove the need to shock for chloramines, although shocking would still be used to address a fecal accident in the pool. UV will not replace chlorine, but is used to control the level of chloramines, which are responsible for the odor, irritation, and enhanced corrosion at an indoor pool. Copper ion system Copper ion systems use a 220v current across .500 gm bars (solid copper, or a mixture of copper and .100 gm or silver) to free copper ions into the flow of pool water to kill organisms such as algae in the water and provide a \\"residual\\" in the water. Alternative systems also use titanium plates to produce oxygen in the water to help degrade organic compounds. Private pool filtration=Water pumps An electrically operated water pump is the prime motivator in recirculating the water from the pool. Water is forced through a filter and then returned to the pool. Using a water pump by itself is often not sufficient to completely sanitize a pool. Commercial and public pool pumps usually run 24 hours a day for the entire operating season of the pool. Residential pool pumps are typical run for 4 hours per day in winter (when the pool is not in use) and up to 24 hours in summer. To save electricity costs, most pools run water pumps for between 6 hours and 12 hours in summer with the pump being controlled by an electronic timer. Most pool pumps available today incorporate a small filter basket as the last effort to avoid leaf or hair contamination reaching the close-tolerance impeller section of the pump. Filtration unitsSand= A pressure-fed sand filter is typically placed in line immediately after the water pump. The filter typically contains a medium such as graded sand (called '14/24 Filter Media' in the UK system of grading the size of sand by sifting through a fine brass-wire mesh of 14 to the inch (5.5 per centimeter) to 24 to the inch (9.5 per cm)). A pressure fed sand filter is termed a 'High Rate' sand filter, and will generally filter turbid water of particulates no less than 10 micrometers in size. The rapid sand filter type are periodically 'back washed' as contaminants reduce water flow and increase back pressure. Indicated by a pressure gauge on the pressure side of the filter reaching into the 'red line' area, the pool owner is alerted to the need to 'backwash' the unit. The sand in the filter will typically last five to seven years before all the \\"rough edges\\" are worn off and the more tightly packed sand no longer works as intended . Recommended filtration for public/commercial pools are 1 ton sand per 100,000 liters water (10 ounces avdp. per cubic foot of water) [7.48 US or 6.23 UK gallons]. Introduced in the early 1900s was another type of sand filter; the 'Rapid Sand' filter, whereby water was pumped into the top of a large volume tank (3' 0\\" or more cube) (1 cubic yard/200US gal/170UK gal/770 liters) containing filter grade sand, and returning to the pool through a pipe at the bottom of the tank. As there is no pressure inside this tank, they were also known as 'gravity filters'. These type of filters are not greatly effective, and are no longer common in home swimming pools, being replaced by the pressure-fed type filter. =Diatomaceous earth= Some filters use diatomaceous earth to help filter out contaminants. Commonly referred to as 'D.E.' filters, they exhibit superior filtration capabilities.National Center for Environmental Health: Healthy Housing Reference Manual ‚Äì Residential Pool and Spa Filters Often a D.E. filter will trap waterborne contaminants as small as 1 micrometer in size. D.E. filters are banned in some states, as they must be emptied out periodically and the contaminated media flushed down the sewer, causing a problem in some districts' sewage systems. =Cartridge filters= Other filter media that have been introduced to the residential swimming pool market since 1970 include sand particles and paper type cartridge filters of 50 to filter area arranged in a tightly packed 12\\" diameter x 24\\" long (300 mm x 600 mm) accordion-like circular cartridge. These units can be 'daisy-chained' together to collectively filter almost any size home pool. The cartridges are typically cleaned by removal from the filter body and hosing-off down a sewer connection. They are popular where backwashed water from a sand filter is not allowed to be discharged or goes into the aquifer. =Automated pool cleaners= Automated pool cleaner Automated pool cleaners more commonly known as \\"Automatic pool cleaners\\" and in particular electric, robotic pool cleaners provide an extra measure of filtration, and in fact like the handheld vacuums can microfilter a pool, which a sand filter without flocculation or coagulalents is unable to accomplishJames E. Amburgey, Kimberly J. Walsh, Roy R. Fielding and Michael J. Arrowood Removal of Cryptosporidium and polystyrene microspheres from swimming pool water with sand, cartridge, and precoat filters, IWA Publishing 2012 These cleaners are independent from the pool's main filter and pump system and are powered by a separate electricity source, usually in the form of a set-down transformer that is kept at least from the water in the pool, often on the pool deck. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and then return the filtered water at a high rate of speed back into the pool water. The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and \\"brushes\\" connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling paint rollers, are located on the front and back of the machine and help remove contaminating particles from the pool's floor, walls (and in some designs even the pool steps) depending on size and configuration. They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag.American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association, Volume 11, April 1912, Issue 4, Read at the Annual meeting of the Association, held in Havana, December 1911Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places Prepared by the Joint Committee on Bathing Places of the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers and the Engineering and Sanitation Section of the American Public Health Association 1957 =Other systems= Saline chlorination units, electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with ultra-violet lamp systems, and \\"Tri-Chlor Feeders\\" are other independent or auxiliary systems for swimming pool sanitation. =Consecutive dilution= A consecutive dilution system is arranged to remove organic waste in stages after it passes through the skimmer. Waste matter is trapped inside one or more sequential skimmer basket sieves, each having a finer mesh to further dilute contaminant size. Dilution here is defined as the action of making something weaker in force, content, or value. The first basket is placed closely after the skimmer mouth. The second is attached to the circulation pump. Here the 25% of water drawn from the main drain at the bottom of the swimming pool meets the 75% drawn from the surface. The circulation pump sieve basket is easily accessible for service and is to be emptied daily. The third sieve is the sand unit. Here smaller organic waste that has slipped through the previous sieves is trapped by sand. If not removed regularly, organic waste will continue to rot down and affect water quality. The dilution process allows organic waste to be easily removed. Ultimately the sand sieve can be backwashed to remove smaller trapped organic waste which otherwise leaches ammonia and other compounds into the recirculated water. These additional solutes eventually lead to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBP's). The sieve baskets are easily removed daily for cleaning as is the sand unit, which should be back-washed at least once a week. A perfectly maintained consecutive dilution system drastically reduces the build-up of chloramines and other DBP's. The water returned to the pool should have been cleared of all organic waste above 10 microns in size. =Mineral sanitizers= Mineral sanitizers for the swimming pool and spa use minerals, metals, or elements derived from the natural environment to produce water quality benefits that would otherwise be produced by harsh or synthetic chemicals. Companies are not allowed to sell a mineral sanitizer in the United States unless it has been registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Currently two mineral sanitizers are registered with the EPA: one is a silver salt with a controlled release mechanism which is applied to calcium carbonate granules that help neutralize pH; the other uses a colloidal form of silver released into water from ceramic beads.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NTB/is_24_44/ai_n15969728/ Mineral technology takes advantage of the cleansing and filtering qualities of commonly occurring substances. Silver and copper are well-known oligodynamic substances that are effective in destroying pathogens. Silver has been shown to be effective against harmful bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Copper is widely used as an algicide. Alumina, derived from aluminates, filters detrimental materials at the molecular level, and can be used to control the delivery rate of desirable metals such as copper. Working through the pool or spa filtration system, mineral sanitizers use combinations of these minerals to inhibit algae growth and eliminate contaminants. Unlike chlorine or bromine, metals and minerals do not evaporate, and do not degrade. Minerals can make the water noticeably softer, and by replacing harsh chemicals in the water they lower the potential for red-eye, dry skin and foul odors. SkimmersCoping apertures= Water is typically drawn from the pool via a rectangular aperture in the wall, connected through to a device fitted into one (or more) wall/s of the pool. The internals of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangle lid, about one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational water is drawn from the pool over a floating hinged weir (operating from a vertical position to 90 degrees angle away from the pool, in order to stop leaves and debris being back-flooded into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable \\"skimmer basket\\", the purpose of which is to entrap leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris. The aperture visible from the pool side is typically 1' 0\\" (300 mm) wide by 6\\" (150 mm) high, which intersects the water midway though the center of the aperture. Skimmers with apertures wider than this are termed \\"wide angle\\" skimmers and may be as much as 2' 0\\" wide (600 mm). Floating skimmers have the advantage of not being affected by the level of the water as these are adjusted to work with the rate of pump suction and will retain optimum skimming regardless of water level leading to a markedly reduced amount of bio-material in the water. Skimmers should always have a leaf basket or filter between it and the pump to avoid blockages in the pipes leading to the pump and filter. Pool re-circulation Water returning from the consecutive dilution system is passed through return jets below the surface. These are designed to impact a turbulent flow as the water enters the pool. This flow as a force is far less than the mass of water in the pool and takes the least pressure route upward where eventually surface tension reforms it into a laminar flow on the surface. As the returned water disturbs the surface, it creates a capillary wave. If the return jets are positioned correctly, this wave creates a circular motion within the surface tension of the water, allowing that on the surface to slowly circulate around the pool walls. Organic waste floating on the surface through this circulation from the capillary wave is slowly drawn past the mouth of the skimmer where it is pulled in due to the laminar flow and surface tension over the skimmer weir. In a well-designed pool, circulation caused by the disturbed returned water aids in removing organic waste from the pool surface, directing it to be trapped inside the consecutive dilution system for easy disposal. Many return jets are equipped with a swivel nozzle. Used correctly, it induces deeper circulation, further cleaning the water. Turning the jet nozzles at an angle imparts rotation within the entire depth of pool water. Orientation to the left or right would generate clockwise or anti-clockwise rotation respectively. This has the benefit of cleaning the bottom of the pool and slowly moving sunken inorganic debris to the main drain where it is removed by the circulation pump basket sieve. In a correctly constructed pool, rotation of the water caused by the manner it is returned from the consecutive dilution system will reduce or even waive the need to vacuum the bottom. To gain the maximum rotation force on the main body of water, the consecutive dilution system needs to be as clean and unblocked as possible to allow maximum flow pressure from the pump. As the water rotates, it also disturbs organic waste at lower water layers, forcing it to the top. Rotational force the pool return jets create is the most important part of cleaning the pool water and pushing organic waste across the mouth of the skimmer. With a correctly designed and operated swimming pool, this circulation is visible and after a period of time, reaches even the deep end, inducing a low-velocity vortex above the main drain due to suction. Correct use of the return jets is the most effective way of removing disinfection by-products caused by deeper decomposing organic waste and drawing it into the consecutive dilution system for immediate disposal. =Heaters= Other equipment which may be optioned in the recirculation system include pool water heaters. They can be heat pumps, natural gas or propane gas heaters, electric heaters, wood burning heaters, or Solar hot water panel heaters ‚Äì increasingly used in the sustainable design of pools. =Other equipment= Diversions to electronic oxidation systems, ionization systems, microbe disinfection with ultra-violet lamp systems, and \\"Tri-Chlor Feeders\\" are other auxiliary systems for Swimming pool sanitation; as well as solar panels; are in most cases required to be placed after the filtration equipment, and are the last items before the water is returned to the pool. Other features=Recreation amenities Features that are part of the water circulation system can extend treatment capacity needs for sizing calculations and can include: artificial streams and waterfalls, in-pool fountains, integrated hot tubs and spas, water slides and sluices, artificial \\"pebble beaches\\", submerged seating as bench-ledges or as \\"stools\\" at in-pool bars, plunge pools, and shallow children's wading pools.

He is the author of Iudicium Pronosticon Anni 1483 Currentis. Biography Yuriy Drohobych was born in the city of Drohobych in Red Ruthenia, or Ruthenia Rubra (modern day Western Ukraine), to a family of a salt maker Michael-Donat. He received his primary education in the local parochial school in St. George's Church and after that he studied at a lyceum in Lviv (), or Leopolis, in Ukraine (then Palatinatus Russiae of the Kingdom of Poland). Education Yuriy Drohobych In 1468 Yuriy Drohobych entered the Jagiellonian University (Uniwersytet Jagiello≈Ñski) in Krakow. Two years later he received his bachelor's degree and in 1473 his master's. He taught during the summer months and participated in scientific discussions on Saturdays and Sundays. After he gained some significant achievements in Krakow, Drohobych traveled to Bologna University, where natural sciences and medicine were gaining popularity. Here he improved his Latin, learned Greek, and continued his studies of natural philosophy. He paid special attention to his studies in astronomy. It's worth noting that Drohobych's astronomy professor was Girolamo Manfredi, one of the most renowned astronomers in 15th century Italy. Manfredi introduced his promising student to German astronomer Johannes M√ºller (Regiomontanus) who believed in heliocentrism; however, it had not been mathematically proven at that time.–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –ø–µ–¥–∞–≥–æ–≥—ñ–∫–∞ –≤ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–ª—ñ—è—Ö ‚Äì –•–Ü–• —Å—Ç–æ–ª—ñ—Ç—Ç—è / –ó–∞ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü—ñ—î—é –û.–í. –°—É—Ö–æ–º–ª–∏–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó / –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –ø–æ—Å—ñ–±–Ω–∏–∫ –¥–ª—è —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–≤ –≤–∏—â–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏—Ö –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—ñ–≤, —É –¥–≤–æ—Ö –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞—Ö// ¬´–õ–∏–±—ñ–¥—å¬ª, - –ö., 2005, –∫–Ω. 1., —Å—Ç–æ—Ä. Teaching In 1478 Drohobych received his doctorate in philosophy, but he continued his studies. This time he took up medicine. At that time natural philosophy disciplines were closely connected. Almost all contemporary philosophers demonstrated equally strong prowess in astronomy and medicine, which allowed university professors to transfer from one department to another. Similar methods were used in teaching both disciplines. It was done through reading and interpretation of Latin translations of Greek and Arab classical authors. Medicine was considered the key to understanding nature. Shortly after Drohobych completed his medical studies, he was offered a position to teach astronomy at Bologna University. At the beginning of 1481, the student body of the University elected Drohobych to become the rector of the school of Medicine and Free Arts. He was only thirty at the time. For a year, which was the regular term in office for an elected rector, he combined his academic responsibilities, which included teaching astronomy and medical research, with administrative obligations. He had civil and legal authority over the students and faculty who were under his supervision. In 1482 he received his PhD in medicine. In 1486 Drohobych returned to Krakow. He started his medical practice and also taught medicine at Krakow University. Similar to his peers from Bologna, he based his lectures on the works of Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna. A few years later, he received his professorship in medicine and became the doctor of the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon. In 1492 he became the Dean of the Department of Medicine. It was customary at that time for professors to have off-site meetings to discuss with students issues that did not fit the official scientific doctrine. Copernicus attended Drohobych's meetings, however it is not certain whether the former had an influence on the latter. It's worth noting that at that time ‚Äòmedicine' as we understand the term today was viewed differently in the 15th century. In fact, there were two terms designated to define healing practices. The term ‚Äòmedicine' derived from the Latin verb medico, meaning \\"to drug\\". The practice of medicine therefore emphasized an ability to administer curative remedies.David Lindberg, Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution, Cambridge University Press 1990. Such remedies might be the potions of quacks (quackery), developed only to make the seller a profit, or therapies that were invented or revised on the basis of experiences of a particular practitioner with patients and remedies. What was crucial to good medical practice was what we call nowadays \\"clinical experience\\": an experienced judgment about what remedies would help a particular patient. A medical education in universities, therefore, might supplement, but was not always necessary for \\"medical\\" practice. Hence, practitioners of medicine without university degrees were called \\"empirics\\" by the educated physicians. For their part, physicians themselves practiced another kind of healing art, \\"physic\\". The term derived from the Greek noun physis, meaning \\"nature\\". Physicians had to study natural philosophy because the purposes of physic were to preserve health and prolong life; healing the sick was an important part, but only one of the many parts, of physic. The physician had to be able to offer advice to the healthy as well as to the sick about how to live according to nature, for being in harmony with nature would result in the preservation of health as well as the prolongation of life. Thus \\"medicine\\" and \\"physic,\\" as used in the late 15th century, are terms that suggest the differences between major traditions in the healing arts: one based upon experience, the other upon learning; one concerned primarily with healing, the other primarily with the preservation of health. Drohobych's appointment to King Casimir's court is an indication that he succeeded in both healing fields, because such an important position required extraordinary knowledge of philosophy and natural philosophy as well as practical experience in curing illnesses. Publications His teaching at Bologna did not interfere with his experiments in astronomy. In a letter which he sent in early 1478 to his friend Mykola Chepel in Pozna≈Ñ, Drohobych mentioned his calculations of planetary positions during a year. According to his observations and calculations, he estimated the exact time for two lunar eclipses; he also included a chart of the phases of the Moon for a year. In the letter, Drohobych described how he had calculated the geographic locations of major cities in what is now Poland and Ukraine. He also gave predictions concerning political events that had been taking place in Europe, Egypt, Turkey, Arabia, and India. Mykola Chepel shared these notes with his colleagues at Pozna≈Ñ University. The news about Drohobych's findings quickly spread among many learned people in Europe. One of the first German Humanists and book collector, Hartmann Schedel, copied these letters. In part thanks to his efforts, they were preserved for posterity. Drohobych wrote a treatise about the solar eclipse that took place on July 29, 1478. He suggested that cosmic events of this nature may or may not have favorable effects on events on Earth but they certainly would not cause catastrophes. In the early 1480s, Italy was at the forefront of book printing. Initially all publications were of a religious nature, however books about astronomy, botany, and geography had been growing in popularity, too. In 1483 Drohobych published in Rome his first book in Latin \\"Prognostic Estimation of the year 1483\\" (Iudicium Pronosticon Anni MCCCCLXXXIII Currentis). It was a nineteen-page publication of astrological (zodiac) calendars, which were popular at that time, that helped its readers to make predictions about events on Earth depending on the planets' positions. This publication had several noteworthy elements: Drohobych gave accurate predictions for two lunar eclipses; he provided accurate calculations of the phases of the Moon; and he also touched upon the subject of planetary movement. Furthermore, he indicated that the geographic coordinates were an important factor in determining the sun's and planets' positions. Depending on the geographic location of the observer, the positions of cosmic objects would vary. His longitude calculations were not error-free, however. He deserves credit for being the first Eastern European scholar who in a printed publication indicated the exact geographic coordinates of several Ukrainian, Polish, and Lithuanian cities. Weather forecasting was another aspect of Drohobych's publication. He suggested that by observing atmospheric phenomena, one can predict the weather. He also argued that climatic conditions depended on the latitude of a geographic location. One of the most important aspects of this treatise was the author's vision that the world is not an abstract notion and that humans are capable of learning its patterns and laws. In the foreword to the treatise, Drohobych wrote that even though our eyes cannot see the end of the boundless skies, our mind can. That we learn from the effect about the cause and from the latter we truly learn.–î–æ–≤—ñ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ –∑ —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏. –ó–∞ —Ä–µ–¥. –Ü.–ü—ñ–¥–∫–æ–≤–∏ —Ç–∞ –†.–®—É—Å—Ç–∞. ‚Äî –ö.: –ì–µ–Ω–µ–∑–∞, 1993 In 1491 Drohobych, published one of the first books in Church Slavonic language \\"–û—Å—å–º–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–Ω–∏–∫\\", (\\"Octoechos \\"or \\"Antiphonal\\") and the first books in Ukrainian \\"–ß–∞—Å–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ—Ü—å\\" (\\"Horologion\\" or \\"Book of Hour\\"), \\"–¢—Ä—ñ–æ–¥—å –ø—ñ—Å–Ω–∞\\" and \\" –¢—Ä—ñ–æ–¥—å —Ü–≤—ñ—Ç–Ω–∞\\" (Triodion). All these publications built the foundation for the further development of the Ukrainian cultural identity. Yuriy Drohobych died on February 4, 1494 in Krakow, at only 44. However, he left behind a rich legacy. During his tenure on the faculty of Krakow University, humanistic ideas began to gain popularity among professors and students.Orest Subtelny, Ukraine: A History, University of Toronto Press 1988, p.155 Drohobych was the first Ukrainian scholar who began to advance these ideas in Ukraine. As time went on, he found many followers among Ukrainian scholars and students who studied in Italy and Poland and who disseminated these ideas upon their return to their homeland. In the mid-15th century, due to the lack of internal and external stimuli, Ukraine's education system slipped into decay. Drohobych and his followers created a niche that helped to preserve, sustain, and develop socio-cultural and philosophical ideas that lay the foundation for Ukraine's revival by the 17th and 18th centuries, which played an important role in preserving the national identity at a time when present-day Ukrainian lands belong to different rulers.

History  The monastery was founded, probably in 1147 or 1148, by Count Berthold of Eberstein as a family monastery, although the foundation charter only survives in a corrupt copy of 1270.Founding charter of Herrenalb Abbey in the State Archives of Baden- W√ºrttemberg: W√ºrttembergisches Urkundenbuch Online. Vol II, number 330. The new monastery was settled by monks from Neubourg Abbey in Alsace. The Vogtei (advocacy or protective lordship) was the property of the founder and his family, but the abbey had the concession that within those limits it was able to choose which individual it wanted for the role. In 1289 the Margrave of Baden became Vogt and in 1338 the Count of W√ºrttemberg, who thenceforward retained the office despite continuing efforts of the Margraves of Baden. The abbey owned scattered estates in the Alb valley in the northern Black Forest and round the communities of Ottersweier, Malsch (acquired 1318), Bruchsal, Oberderdingen, Vaihingen an der Enz and Merklingen (acquired 1296), among others. The abbey was however never able to concentrate its lands so as to maximise their economic potential, and never became particularly wealthy. The abbey at some stage received Reichsfreiheit as an Imperial abbey, but appears to have lost this status in 1497, with the abbey's territory being secularised to W√ºrttemberg, with Baden gaining some of the outlying villages. Herrenalb: From Convent to Spa town It was laid waste in the German Peasants' War of 1525. After Duke Ulrich introduced the Reformation to W√ºrttemberg in 1534, the monks were forced to leave the abbey in 1536. A school was set up in the buildings in 1556 but was closed again in 1595. Some buildings still remain of the original monastic complex, among them what appear to be the abbot's lodgings and the infirmary, besides ruins of the cloisters. The Romanesque tithe barn also still survives. Of the abbey church there are substantial remains of the Romanesque paradise (entrance hall). The Gothic choir was converted for use as a Lutheran church in 1739 and still contains many relics of its former use, including a monument to Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden (died 1435, but not buried here). An impressive sculptured panel of the Crucifixion from the abbey was removed from Bad Herrenalb to Schloss Eberstein in the Murg valley in the 19th century.

It started as a series of archival releases featuring previously released as well as unreleased studio and live recordings. It eventually developed into a website featuring almost the whole of Young's recording output throughout his career, available for streaming in high resolution audio format. The project has been long in the making ‚Äì work began in the late 1980s. Throughout its development, Young himself has made several statements about the material included, release dates, and marketing that have proven false as the project was modified for new multimedia formats and expanded upon to accommodate new releases or other relevant material.Shakey, Jimmy McDonough Young has said that there will be five volumes covering approximately 50 years.YouTube clip: \\"Neil Young Archives Demo at Java.\\" The archives are divided into several series. The main series consists of several volumes of box sets, each covering a separate period of the artist's career. The Performance Series consists of individual releases of live material, each representing a specific show or four. Finally, there is the Special Release Series, which consists of previously unreleased albums. These different series also overlap; for example, two volumes of the Performance Series that are included on the each of the first two Archives box set releases are also available separately. Homegrown is also included in its entirety on Neil Young Archives Vol. 2: 1972-1976 but was also released on its own earlier in 2020. As of 2019, Neil Young has launched a subscription website and application where all of his music is available to stream in high resolution audio. The Neil Young Archives also include his newspaper, The Times-Contrarian; The Hearse Theater, which shows limited runs of concert films and rare footage; and photos and memorabilia throughout his career. Box sets=Volume I: 1963‚Äì1972 The first volume, The Archives Vol. 1 1963‚Äì1972, was released on June 2, 2009. Covering Young's early years with The Squires and Buffalo Springfield, it also includes cuts, demos, outtakes and alternate versions of songs from his albums Neil Young, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, After the Gold Rush, and Harvest, as well as tracks he recorded with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young during this time. Also included in the set are several live discs, as well as a DVD of the long out-of-print film Journey Through the Past, directed by Young in the early 1970s. Volume I was released as a set of 10 Blu-ray discs in order to present high resolution audio as well as accompanying visual documentation. It is also available as a 10 disc DVD set and an 8 disc CD set. On January 31, 2010, the box set won the Grammy Award for Best Art Direction on a Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, and was shared by Neil Young along with his art directors Gary Burden and Jenice Heo. Volume II: 1972‚Äì1976 Similar in scope to the first box set, Neil Young Archives Volume II: 1972‚Äì1976 is scheduled to be released on November 20. Covering Young's work with The Stray Gators, Santa Monica Flyers, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Crazy Horse, and The Stills-Young Band during this period, it will also include cuts, demos, outtakes and alternate versions of songs from his albums Time Fades Away, Tonight‚Äôs the Night, On the Beach, Zuma, and Long May You Run, as well as the unreleased (until 2020) album Homegrown in its entirety and tracks from CSNY's multiple sessions for their aborted Human Highway album. Also as with Volume I, included in the set are several live discs, including the unreleased live album Odeon Budokan. Volume II will be released as a set of 10 CDs (with a deluxe edition containing a hardbound book), and will not have Blu-ray or DVD editions due to, as Young has exclaimed, ‚Äúeconomic reasons.‚Äù Young's manager Elliot Roberts originally said in 2009 that Volume II would span the period of 1972 through 1982,Sound and Vision magazine article: \\"Sound & Vision Magazine ‚Äì Neil Young: Archives Vol. 1 (1963‚Äì1972)\\". and would be released \\"two or three years\\" after Volume I.

Chrome Dreams, Homegrown and Oceanside-Countryside are the three unreleased studio albums. Also from this period is the unreleased Odeon Budokan live recording produced by David Briggs and Tim Mulligan\\".News , Neil Young Website. In May 2014, Young stated that Volume II would be finished by the summer, and that the remaining volumes would be issued relatively quickly following the second. In July 2016, Rolling Stone and the Thrasher's Wheat website reported that Young intended to focus on completing Archives Volume II after his tour with Promise of the Real concluded that October. Although a physical release was still planned, it would also involve a \\"high- resolution website\\" and would also include unreleased works entitled Dume and Hitchhiker (Hitchhiker was later released as a standalone album on September 8, 2017, with Dume later confirmed to be a disc on Volume II). In August 2018, in response to an enquiring fan in the ‚ÄòLetters to the Editor‚Äô section of the NYA Times-Contrarian area of his website, Neil had the following to say: \\"May 2019 the NYA V2 CDs and a separate book by Toshi Onuki will be available. Blu Ray is no longer viable for economic reasons. NYA can give you what the blu ray had though, including Hi Res audio. Thanks NY.\\"Neil Young Archives Times- Contrarian reply: \\"Letters NYA V2\\". In September 2018, March and April 2019, in response to other fans enquiring on its release in the ‚ÄòLetters to the Editor‚Äô section of the NYA, Neil Young stated: \\"We are currently reviewing all of the unreleased albums from the Volume II period, which is the seventies. ‚ÄòSongs for Judy‚Äô was one of those. ‚ÄòOceanside Countryside‚Äô is another. We are reviewing the others.\\" ; \\"NYA vol 2 late this year/before Christmas. Odeon Budokon is on volume 2 as an album.\\" ; \\"Volume two has so much content that we have made it into two sets. The first is about ten discs and will include ‚ÄòOdeon Budokan‚Äô. The set covers about 4 or 5 years of intense recording and creativity.\\"'Neil Young Archives Times-Contrarian reply: \\"NYA VOL 2\\". In March 2020, Young confirmed Volume II for release on July 24 of that year. After numerous delays related to the Coronavirus pandemic, it is now scheduled to be released on November 20, according to the Archives website. A track listing posted to the Archives site on September 20th confirmed Volume II‚Äôs contents, and the first single, ‚ÄúCome Along and Say You Will,‚Äù was posted to the site as the Song of the Day on October 14th. The set then went up for pre- order on the 16th as an exclusive release to his online store, with only 3,000 copies being initially made available worldwide . After selling out the following day, Neil has announced that a second edition is being planned. Volume III (1976-1980s) Little information about Volume III of the Archives has been announced. The website for Young's Living with War album contains several live recordings of songs from Life, which the page cites as being \\"From The Neil Young Archives, Volume 3\\". However, with Volume II now only spanning up until 1976, it's highly unlikely that Volume III will go as far back as that album. Volume IV (1990s) Volume IV will likely feature tracks from the 1990s. Volume V (2000s) Elliot Roberts and Neil Young have said that the Archives project will extend into a fifth volume, which should include songs from 2009's Fork in the Road and the unreleased Toast album, which was recorded with Crazy Horse in 2000.Rolling Stone article: \\"Neil Young And Crazy Horse To Release Lost 2000 Album\\".

The concert was held in Toronto, ON, Canada in 2003 as the supporting tour for his album, \\"Greendale.\\" Official Bootleg Series In September 2020, Neil officially announced a new series of releases called the Official Bootleg Series. The original intent behind this series was to duplicate popular bootlegs, right down to their original cover art, but upgrading the audio for the best possible fidelity. However, this concept has changed as chosen shows have been announced; for example, the first officially announced entry, Carnegie Hall, will take its audio from the December 4th, 1970 show (which Neil prefers) as opposed to the heavily circulated December 5th midnight set. On October 7th, the first six entries of the Official Bootleg Series were announced, as well as that Nick Bolas will be helping Neil in the production of these releases. The first six shows that will be a part of this series are: * Carnegie Hall, December 4th, 1970: a different show from the heavily bootlegged set from the night before, this release will be newly mixed from the original multi-track recordings. * Royce Hall, January 30th, 1971: the source for both \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" from Harvest and \\"Love in Mind\\" from Time Fades Away, this show will also be newly mixed from the original multi-track recordings. * Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 'I'm Happy That Y'all Came Down,' February 1st, 1971: as with Carnegie Hall and Royce Hall, this show will again be newly mixed from the original multi-track recordings. * Under the Rainbow, November 5th, 1973: a heavily bootlegged show featuring the Santa Monica Flyers. No source has yet been mentioned for this release, though it was put up to a fan vote as a potential official release before this series was announced. * The Bottom Line, 'Citizen Kane Jr. Blues,' May 16th, 1974: an extremely legendary show in Neil's career, this has been newly mastered from the original cassette that the show was recorded on. * The Ducks, 'Trick of Disaster', August 1977: Several of the Ducks' Santa Monica club shows from their brief run in 1976 were professionally recorded with Neil's analog truck (\\"His Master's Wheels\\"). This release will be a \\"multi-platter\\" compilation drawn from these shows that has been mixed and assembled by Tim Mulligan, who produced and recorded the original recordings. Currently being mastered, all six entries of the series will be released at once, with a target release date of April, 2021. These will also receive physical releases, in addition to being available on the Neil Young Archives site. Official Release Series Although the Archives label is predominantly used for previously unreleased material, the name is also being attached to remastered editions of existing albums. Such releases are labeled Neil Young Archives Official Release Series. Since the introduction of PonoMusic, the following albums have been re-released as part of the Official Release Series: Official Release Series 01: * Neil Young Official Release Series 02: * Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere Official Release Series 03: * After the Gold Rush Official Release Series 04: * Harvest Official Release Series 05: * Time Fades Away Official Release Series 06: * On the Beach Official Release Series 07: * Tonight's the Night Official Release Series 08: * Zuma Official Release Series 08.5: * Long May You Run Official Release Series 09: * American Stars 'n Bars Official Release Series 10: * Comes a Time Official Release Series 11: * Rust Never Sleeps Official Release Series 12: * Live Rust Official Release Series 13: * Hawks & Doves Official Release Series 14: * Re¬∑ac¬∑tor Official Release Series 20: * This Note's For You Official Release Series 30: * Dead Man (soundtrack) Compact disc versions of the first four above albums were released on 14 July 2009. In addition, the albums were reissued as limited edition box sets on 24 November 2009, in both 180-gram vinyl and 24k gold CD versions. 140-gram vinyl editions of the individual albums were also issued on that date. On the 28th of November 2014, the series no. 05-08 were also reissued as limited edition vinyl box sets. When the PonoMusic Store went live in the end of 2014, another six albums were reissued as digital downloads, making a total of 14 albums available in 24 Bit & 192 kHz (including the 1973 album Time Fades Away, which hadn't been officially re-released before then). Digital Masterpiece Series In 2003, Neil Young released On The Beach, American Stars 'N Bars, Hawks & Doves, and Re¬∑ac¬∑tor on compact disc for the first time. These were reissued as HDCDs as part of the Neil Young Archives Digital Masterpiece Series. The CD versions were subsequently joined by DVD- Audio versions. Special Release Series Neil Young has also announced a part of the archives known as the Special Release Series. Toast, a previously unreleased album recorded in 2000 with Crazy Horse, was the first album to be announced as being part of the Special Release Series. Though announced in 2008, Toast remains unreleased (as of May 2020). It was then announced that the second volume of Archives box sets would include four SRS releases; the studio albums Homegrown, Chrome Dreams and Oceanside/Countryside, and the unreleased live album Odeon-Budokan. As of September 2020, only Homegrown has been officially released, though Odeon Budokan is scheduled to be released on November 20th as part of the Neil Young Archives Vol. II: 1972-1976 box set. As Vol. II will now only cover up to early 1976, both Chrome Dreams and Oceanside/Countryside will no longer be a part of this release. Volume 02: Homegrown Homegrown, a long lost unreleased 1975 album, was finally announced for a release in early 2020. Originally scheduled for release on April 17 as part of that year's Record Store Day, it was delayed until June 19 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume 05: Hitchhiker Hitchhiker features an entirely solo 1976 session at Indigo Ranch Recording Studio in Malibu, California, possibly intended for release in the late 1970s but rejected by Reprise at the time. It was released on September 8, 2017, becoming the first officially released SRS volume. Volume 10: Original Soundtrack from \\"Paradox\\" movie Paradox was released on March 23, 2018.  Scheduled/possible upcoming releases  Young has mentioned many as-of-yet unreleased studio albums and live albums that he has recorded over the years, including: * Early Daze (Neil Young & Crazy Horse, 1969).

From the time of appointment of Baptist May - often claimed to be the most trusted friend of King Charles IIAndrew Barclay, 'May, Baptist (bap. 1628, d. 1697)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 22 April 2007 \\\\- the ranger has been given the use of the Great Lodge (now called Cumberland Lodge) as a residence. One of the most famous rangers was Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, who was given the position by her friend, Queen Anne, in 1702. Officially, at least, she shared the office with other family members. After her death, the rangership was given to successive trusted friends and family members of the British Royal Family. The office is currently held by The Duke of Edinburgh. Cumberland Lodge within the Park ceased to be the official residence for the rangers in 1917. In 1947, George VI gave the house to the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Foundation of St Katharine's, who continue to have the use of the building.

M√ºller was Professor at the University of Freiburg and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Life Max M√ºller was born as the son of a jurist and completed his Gymnasium-Abitur in Freiburg at the Friedrich-Gymnasium Freiburg. M√ºller graduated in 1930 along with the philosopher Martin Honecker. He established himself in 1937 with a work on Tomas Aquinas (\\"Reality and Rationality\\"'). At this time he was active in the Catholic Youth Movement who were influenced by their study with Martin Heidegger, generating their own thinking in engagement with his philosophy. During the Third Reich they were opponents of Nazism. Falling foul of Nazi educational policies, M√ºller was dismissed by Heidegger from research positions. He became active as a lecturer at the Catholic . After the war he succeeded the late Martin Honecker in his academic positions at the University of Freiburg. In addition to his activity at the university M√ºller was active in addressing social problems in Freiburg. In 1960 he moved to Ludwig Maximilians university in Munich. After his retirement he returned to Freiburg for research activity in philosophy and theology. M√ºller's main influences were Honecker, Edmund Husserl and Heidegger. He was also influenced by the historian Friedrich Meinecke and the theologian Romano Guardini. M√ºller's philosophy  M√ºller linked classical metaphysics with phenomenology of Husserl and the existentialism of Heidegger. He developed from it a theory of ‚Äúmetahistory‚Äù as a philosophy of historical liberty. For M√ºller, the sense of history is distinctive in each epoch. The \\"transcendental experience\\" of humans is created in personal engagement through communal achievement in the world as work. Politics, religion, art and science, along with the personal relationships between people, carry material and symbolic means to attempt answers and achieve effective representations.

When a vessel is within radar range of land or special radar aids to navigation, the navigator can take distances and angular bearings to charted objects and use these to establish arcs of position and lines of position on a chart.Maloney, 2003:744. A fix consisting of only radar information is called a radar fix.Bowditch, 2002:816. Some types of radar fixes include the relatively self-explanatory methods of \\"range and bearing to a single object,\\"National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:163. \\"two or more bearings,\\" \\"tangent bearings,\\" and \\"two or more ranges.\\" Parallel indexing is a technique defined by William Burger in the 1957 book The Radar Observer's Handbook.National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:169. This technique involves creating a line on the screen that is parallel to the ship's course, but offset to the left or right by some distance. This parallel line allows the navigator to maintain a given distance away from hazards. Some techniques have been developed for special situations. One, known as the \\"contour method,\\" involves marking a transparent plastic template on the radar screen and moving it to the chart to fix a position.National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:164. Another special technique, known as the Franklin Continuous Radar Plot Technique, involves drawing the path a radar object should follow on the radar display if the ship stays on its planned course.National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:182. During the transit, the navigator can check that the ship is on track by checking that the pip lies on the drawn line. After completing the plotting radar technique, the image from the radar can either be displayed, captured or recorded to a computer monitor using a frame grabber.

Ugra means anger and the idol which was originally called Venkatatturaivar is supposed to represent the anger aspect of Lord Venkateswara. He is also known as Snapana Murti. Legend Legend has it that fire broke out in the village destroying houses during Brahmotsavam at Tirumala in the 14th century A.D. When prayers were offered to the God, a vision appeared to a devotee with a message from Lord Srinivasa himself. With the change in times, the Ugra Srinivasa idol could no longer remain the procession idol and a new idol would be found as utsava murti (Malayappa swami). The Ugra Srinivasa idol is no longer brought out of the temple after sunrise and it is believed that sunrays touching the idol would spark fire in the temple complex. History Apart from Dhruva Bera, the idol of Ugra Srinivasa is the oldest idol in the temple. The date when the idol was consecrated is unknown though records indicate that the idol existed much before the Bhoga Srinivasa was presented in the 10th century AD. Records show that the idol was used as utsava murti till the 14th century when Malayappa swami was found and used as utsava murti. The name Venkatatturaivar means 'resident Godhead of Venkatam' in Tamil language. Worship The idol is about 18 inches long and has a base pedestal 7 inches high. The chakra in the hand of the Lord is called prayoga chakra as it is in a slightly tilted condition as if ready for use. Bhudevi and Sridevi are also found as standing figures. The worship is proportioned solely to this idol on three occasions in a year - Uttana Ekadasi, Mukkoti Dvadasi and Dvadasaradhana. The idol is bought in procession at wee hours only on Kaisika Dvadasi (also known as Mukkoti Dvadasi) while the idol is worshipped inside the temple complex on the remaining two occasions. Relevance of Kaisika Dwadasi Sri Vaishnavas called Prabodhotsava or Uttana Dvadasi as Kaisika Dvadasi. On the Uttana Dvadasi, preparations are made for waking Lord Vishnu, who went to sleep on Ashada Sukla Ekadasi (Vishnu Sayana Ekadasi). Among Sri Vaishnavas, this dvadasi is known as Kaisika dvadasi named after the ragam of a song which was used last in praise of the Lordby devotee Chandala Bhakta Nambaduvan. Bhakta Nambaduvan kept his word and returned to a Rakshasa (demon) to offer his body to be devoured as food by the hungry Rakshasa. The reading of the Kaisika Puranam, which is specially composed in a dialect which is a mixture (manipravalam) of Sanskrit and Tamil or Telugu interspersed with Sanskrit quotations and vernacular explanations is the special feature of the early hours of the morning before day break.

The following poem of Taliesin contains the fullest description of the Briton ‚Äúother world‚Äù that mythological literature can provide. It has been collated by Charles Squire (1905) from four different translations of the text, those being of Mr. W. F. Skene, Mr. T. Stephens, Prof. John Rhys, and D. W. Nash. Mr. T. Stephens, in his \\"Literature of the Kymri\\", calls it \\"one of the least intelligible of the mythological poems\\".Charles Squire, \\"The Mythology of the British Islands\\" (London, 1905) :\\"I will praise the Sovereign, supreme Lord of the land, :Who hath extended his dominion over the shore of the world. :Stout was the prison of Gweir [Gwydion] in Caer Sidi, :Through the spite of Pwyll and Pryderi: :No one before him went into it. :The heavy blue chain firmly held the youth, :And before the spoils of Annwn woefully he sang, :And thenceforth till doom he shall remain a bard. :Thrice enough to fill Prydwen [the name of Arthur's ship] we went into it; :Except seven, none returned from Caer Sidi [Revolving Castle]. :\\"Am I not a candidate for fame, to be heard in song :In Caer Pedryvan [Four-cornered Castle], four times revolving? :The first word from the cauldron, when was it spoken? :By the breath of nine maidens it was gently warmed. :Is it not the cauldron of the Chief of Annwn? What is its fashion? :A rim of pearls is round its edge. :It will not cook the food of a coward or one foresworn. :A sword flashing bright will be raised to him, :And left in the hand of Lleminawg. :And before the door of the gate of Uffren [The Cold Place] the lamp was burning. :When went with Arthur--a splendid labour!-- :Except seven, non returned from Caer Vedwyd [Castle of Revelry]. :\\"Am I not a candidate for fame, to be heard in song :In Caer Pedryvan, in the Isle of the Strong Door, :Where twilight and pitchy darkness meet together, :And bright wine is the drink of the host? :Thrice enough to fill Prydwen we went on the sea. :Except seven, none returned from Caer Rigor [Kingly Castle]. :\\"I will not allow much praise to the leaders of literature. :Beyond Caer Wydyr [Glass Castle] they saw not the prowess of Arthur; :Three- score hundreds stood on the walls; :It was hard to converse with their watchman. :Thrice enough to fill Prydwen we went with Arthur; :Except seven, none returned from Caer Golud [Castle of Riches]. :\\"I will not allow much praise to the spiritless. :They know not on what day, or who caused it, :Or in what hour of the serene day Cwy was born, :Or who caused that he should not go to the dales of Devwy. :They know not the brindled ox with the broad head- band, :Whose yoke is seven-score handbreadths. :When we went with Arthur, of mournful memory, :Except seven, none returned from Caer Vandwy [another name for otherworld]. :\\"I will not allow much praise to those of drooping courage. :They know not what day the chief arose, :Nor in what hour of the serene day the owner was born, :Nor what animal they keep, with its head of silver. :When we went with Arthur, of anxious striving, :Except seven, non returned from Caer Ochren [another name for otherworld].\\" Squire also provides an interpretation of the poem: :\\"The strong-doored, foursquare fortress of glass, manned by its dumb, ghostly sentinels, spun round in never-ceasing revolution, so that few could find its entrance; it was pitch-dark save for the twilight made by the lamp burning before its circling gate; feasting went on there, and revelry, and in its centre, choicest of its many riches, was the pearl-rimmed cauldron of poetry and inspiration, kept bubbling by the breaths of nine British pythonesses, so that it might give forth its oracles.\\" Another few lines penned by Taliesin are sometimes connected to Caer Sidi, although they add little knowledge to what has already been stated in the verses above. These lines are contained in a poem called \\"A Song Concerning the Sons of Llyr ab Brochwel Powys\\" (Book of Taliesin, poem XIV): :\\"Perfect is my chair in Caer Sidi: :Plague and age hurt not him who's in it-- :They know, Manawyddan and Pryderi. :Three organs round a fire sing before it, :And about its points are ocean's streams :And the abundant well above it-- :Sweeter than white wine the drink in it.\\" This confirms that the \\"heavy blue chain [that] firmly held the youth\\" was the sea surrounding Annwn, the Welsh Otherworld, and it makes the point that its inhabitants were freed from age and death. It reveals that the \\"drink of the host\\", the white wine, was kept in a well. Three singing organs are mentioned, an addition to the revelry of Caer Vedwyd [Castle of Revelry]. The first line is also thought to suggest that Taliesin himself was a privileged resident of this country. Some clues are given in the poems as to where the island may be situated. Lundy Island, off the coast of Devonshire, was anciently called Ynys Wair, the \\"Island of Gweir\\", or Gwydion. The Welsh translation of the \\"Seint Grael\\", an Anglo-Norman romance embodying much of the old British and Gaelic mythology, locates its \\"Turning Castle\\" (Caer Sidi), in the district around and comprising Puffin Island, off the coast of Anglesey. Some attempts have been made to give the fortress a physical location, e.g. as the island of Grassholm off the coast of Pembrokeshire,Alwyn and Brinley Rees, Celtic Heritage (London, 1961), p. 48 but Caer Sidi is more likely to belong to the class of otherworldly forts and islands so prevalent in Celtic mythology.

Lake Yalchik plays a major role in tourism in region and several tourist centres are located here. It is renowned locally for its clean and warm water.  Hydrology  Bigger Yalchik, Health complex, June 30, 2014 Lake Yalchik is a system of two lakes, the Greater and Smaller Yalchiks, which are linked by a channel which periodically dries up in summer. The elevation of Smaller Yalchik is higher than that of Greater Yalchik, but flow from Smaller Yalchik can only be observed at spring tide. The area of the lake is increasing due to the karst processes that shape the area. Legend says that the lake appeared after the major collapse of a meadow, which was originally in the location of the lake. The last major collapse occurred in 1914 and it generated a tsunami-like wave. At the bottom of the lake there are two series of karst caves, and long, and up to deep. Greater Yalchik has a complex shape and many bays, whereas Smaller Yalchik has an elongated shape. Smaller Yalchik has two little brooks as inflows, but the Greater Yalchik has none.  Etymology  According to a local Mari legend the lake is named in honour of national hero Yalche. There is also a possibility that the name of the lake has Turkic root. Turkish diminutive suffix is -chik, and yalchik means small yal where yal means village in the Chuvash. Turkish influence could also be seen in the name of the region Mari El, as el means country. Also many of the locations in Marii El have the j√§r/yer endings, which in Turkish means place.  Recreation  The landscape along the lake shore. Being popular for its unique nature, Yalchik attracts many tourists, mostly from Kazan. However, there are no beaches at the lake, and the most of its coastline is covered with reed. Many tourists reach Yalchik by own cars, but a significant number of them use a railway. The closest station to Yalchik is in the settlement of Yalchevsky. Some Mari and Tatarstan universities sometimes arrange science conferences at the Yalchik's rest home.

Bashka Paeff was known as the Subway sculptor for the pieces she modeled at the Park Street T station while working her way through art school at the Boston Museum School. She was especially known for realistic animal sculptures, war memorials, fountains and portraits which she created in the classical tradition. Biography Paeff was born into a Jewish family in Minsk, Russian Empire in 1889. When she was one year old her family emigrated to the United States. At the age of 13 or 14 she enrolled in Massachusetts College of Art and Design (then called Massachusetts Normal Art School) in Boston. In addition to completing programs in drawing, painting, and art education, she studied sculpture with Cyrus Edwin Dallin and graduated in 1911. In 1914 she attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where she studied with Bela Pratt, and was sometimes called the \\"Subway sculptor\\" because she worked at Boston's Park Street T station. Later she worked at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, and subsequently married Samuel Montefiore Waxman, Professor of Romance Languages at Boston University. Today Paeff is perhaps best known for the Maine Sailors and Soldiers Memorial on Route 1 crossing from Portsmouth, New Hampshire into Kittery, Maine. Its creation was marred by some political controversy. She received her commission in 1924 from Governor Percival P. Baxter, but in 1925 his replacement, Governor Ralph Brewster, rejected the piece as overly pacifist. Minor changes accommodated both men, and the revised sculpture was installed in 1926 in what is now called John Paul Jones Memorial Park. Other notable pieces by Paeff include a fountain sculpture of a small boy with bird at the Boston Public Garden (Arlington Street entrance), a statue of Warren G. Harding's pet Airedale at the Smithsonian Institution, a bas relief of Ellen Swallow Richards at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a relief depicting the Battle of Lexington near Buckman Tavern in Lexington, Massachusetts.

The history of navigation is the history of seamanship, the art of directing vessels upon the open sea through the establishment of its position and course by means of traditional practice, geometry, astronomy, or special instruments. A few people have excelled as seafarers, prominent among them the Austronesians (Islander Southeast Asians, Malagasy, Islander Melanesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians), the Harappans, the Phoenicians, the Iranians, the ancient Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the ancient Indians, the Norse, the Chinese, the Venetians, the Genoese, the Hanseatic Germans, the Portuguese, the Spanish, the English, the French, the Dutch and the Danes. Antiquity=Indo-Pacific Austronesians beginning at around 3000 BC Navigation in the Indo-Pacific began with the maritime migrations of the Austronesians from Taiwan who spread southwards into Island Southeast Asia and Island Melanesia during a period between 3000 to 1000 BC. Their first long-distance voyaging was the colonization of Micronesia from the Philippines at around 1500 BC. By about 900 BC their descendants had spread more than 6,000 kilometers across the Pacific, reaching Tonga and Samoa. In this region, a distinctive Polynesian culture developed. Within the next few centuries Polynesians reached Hawaii, New Zealand, Easter Island and possibly South America. Polynesian navigators used a range of tools and methods, including observation of birds, star navigation, and use of waves and swells to detect nearby land. Songs, mythological stories, and star charts were used to help people remember important navigational information. Meanwhile, Austronesians in Island Southeast Asia began the first true maritime trade networks by about 1000 BC, linking China, southern India, the Middle East, and coastal eastern Africa. Settlers from Borneo reached Madagascar by the early 1st millennium AD and colonized it by AD 500.The precise time of Austronesians reaching Madagascar is unknown, at the earliest is the earliest centuries BCE (Blench, ‚ÄúThe Ethnographic Evidence for Long-distance Contacts‚Äù, p. 432.), the latest is no earlier than 7th century CE (Adelaar, ‚ÄúThe Indonesian Migrations to Madagascar‚Äù, p. 15.). Mediterranean Sailors navigating in the Mediterranean made use of several techniques to determine their location, including staying in sight of land and understanding of the winds and their tendencies. Minoans of Crete are an example of an early Western civilization that used celestial navigation. Their palaces and mountaintop sanctuaries exhibit architectural features that align with the rising sun on the equinoxes, as well as the rising and setting of particular stars.Bloomberg, 1678:793 The Minoans made sea voyages to the island of Thera and to Egypt.Bloomberg, 1997:77 Both of these trips would have taken more than a day's sail for the Minoans and would have left them traveling by night across open water. Here the sailors would use the locations of particular stars, especially those of the constellation Ursa Major, to orient the ship in the correct direction. Written records of navigation using stars, or celestial navigation, go back to Homer's Odyssey where Calypso tells Odysseus to keep the Bear (Ursa Major) on his left hand side and at the same time to observe the position of the Pleiades, the late-setting Bo√∂tes and the Orion as he sailed eastward from her island Ogygia traversing the Ocean.Homer, Odyssey, 273-276 The Greek poet Aratus wrote in his Phainomena in the third century BC detailed positions of the constellations as written by Eudoxos.Bloomberg, 1997:72 The positions described do not match the locations of the stars during Aratus' or Eudoxos' time for the Greek mainland, but some argue that they match the sky from Crete during the Bronze Age. This change in the position of the stars is due to the wobble of the Earth on its axis which affects primarily the pole stars.Taylor, 1971:12 Around 1000 BC the constellation Draco would have been closer to the North Pole than Polaris.Taylor, 1971:10 The pole stars were used to navigate because they did not disappear below the horizon and could be seen consistently throughout the night. By the third century BC the Greeks had begun to use the Little Bear, Ursa Minor, to navigate.Taylor, 1971:43 In the mid-1st century AD Lucan writes of Pompey who questions a sailor about the use of stars in navigation. The sailor replies with his description of the use of circumpolar stars to navigate by.Taylor, 1971:46-47 To navigate along a degree of latitude a sailor would have needed to find a circumpolar star above that degree in the sky.Bilic, 2009:126 For example, Apollonius would have used Œ≤ Draconis to navigate as he traveled west from the mouth of the Alpheus River to Syracuse. The voyage of the Greek navigator Pytheas of Massalia is a particularly notable example of a very long, early voyage.Chisholm, 1911:703. A competent astronomer and geographer, Pytheas ventured from Greece through the strait of Gibraltar to Western Europe and the British Isles. Pytheas is the first known person to describe the Midnight Sun,The theoretical existence of a Frigid Zone where the nights are very short in summer and the sun does not set at the summer solstice was already known. Similarly reports of a country of perpetual snows and darkness (the country of the Hyperboreans) had been reaching the Mediterranean for some centuries. Pytheas is the first known scientific visitor and reporter of the arctic. polar ice, Germanic tribes and possibly Stonehenge. Pytheas also introduced the idea of distant \\"Thule\\" to the geographic imagination and his account is the earliest to state that the moon is the cause of the tides. Nearchos's celebrated voyage from India to Susa after Alexander's expedition in India is preserved in Arrian's account, the Indica. Greek navigator Eudoxus of Cyzicus explored the Arabian Sea for Ptolemy VIII, king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. According to Poseidonius, later reported in Strabo's Geography, the monsoon wind system of the Indian Ocean was first sailed by Eudoxus of Cyzicus in 118 or 116 BC.Strabo's Geography - Book II Chapter 3, LacusCurtius. Nautical charts and textual descriptions known as sailing directions have been in use in one form or another since the sixth century BC.Bowditch, 2003:2. Nautical charts using stereographic and orthographic projections date back to the second century BC. In 1900, the Antikythera mechanism was recovered from Antikythera wreck. This mechanism was built around 1st century BC. =Phoenicia and Carthage= The Phoenicians and their successors, the Carthaginians, were particularly adept sailors and learned to voyage further and further away from the coast in order to reach destinations faster. One tool that helped them was the sounding weight. This tool was bell shaped, made from stone or lead, with tallow inside attached to a very long rope. When out to sea, sailors could lower the sounding weight in order to determine how deep the waters were, and therefore estimate how far they were from land. Also, the tallow picked up sediments from the bottom which expert sailors could examine to determine exactly where they were. The Carthaginian Hanno the Navigator is known to have sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar c. 500 BC and explored the Atlantic coast of Africa. There is general consensus that the expedition reached at least as far as Senegal.Donald Harden, The Phoenicians, Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, page 168 There is a lack of agreement whether the furthest limit of Hanno's explorations was Mount Cameroon or Guinea's 890-metre (2910-foot) Mount Kakulima.B.H. Warmington, op. cit., page 79 Nonetheless, Hanno's maritime travels limit may have been further north, as there are well documented difficulties with the return travel from the regions south of cape Chaunar, which, up to the early 15th century, \\"had hitherto been the non plus ultra or impassable limit of European navigation\\" John Locke, \\"The works of John Locke: in nine volumes, Volume 9\\" The history of navigation, p. 385, Printed for C. and J.

Edin. (1755-1813) Asia In the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, a navigator could take advantage of the fairly constant monsoon winds to judge direction.Chisholm, 1911:284. This made long one-way voyages possible twice a year. A 260 CE book by K'ang T'ai (Â∫∑Ê≥∞) described ships with seven sails called po for transporting horses that could travel as far as Syria. He also made reference to monsoon trade between the islands (or archipelago), which took a month and a few days in a large po. About 1000 BC, Nusantaran Austronesian developed tanja sail and junk sail. The invention of these types of sail made sailing around the western coast of Africa possible, because of their ability to sail against the wind.Shaffer, Lynda Norene (1996). Maritime Southeast Asia to 1500. M.E. Sharpe. Ca. 200 AD in Han dynasty, Chuan (junk ships) are developed in China. Chinese people learned junk rig from Malay people visiting their southern coast.Chinese vessels during this era were essentially fluvial (riverine), they did not build true ocean-going fleets until the 10th century Song dynasty. A UNESCO study argues that the Chinese were using square sails during the Han dynasty; only in the 12th century did the Chinese adopt the Malay junk sail. In ca. 50-500 AD Malay and Javanese trading fleets has reached Madagascar. Also brought with them was the Ma'anyan dayak people, as labourer and slaves.Kumar, Ann. (1993). 'Dominion Over Palm and Pine: Early Indonesia‚Äôs Maritime Reach', in Anthony Reid (ed.), Anthony Reid and the Study of the Southeast Asian Past (Sigapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies), 101-122. The Malagasy language originated from Southeast Barito language, and Ma'anyan language is its closest relative, with numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords.Otto Chr. Dahl, Malgache et Maanjan: une comparaison linguistique, Egede-Instituttet Avhandlinger, no. 3 (Oslo: Egede-Instituttet, 1951), p. 13.There are also some Sulawesi loanwords, which Adelaar attributes to contact prior to the migration to Madagascar: See K. Alexander Adelaar, ‚ÄúThe Indonesian Migrations to Madagascar: Making Sense of the Multidisciplinary Evidence‚Äù, in Truman Simanjuntak, Ingrid Harriet Eileen Pojoh and Muhammad Hisyam (eds.), Austronesian Diaspora and the Ethnogeneses of People in Indonesian Archipelago, (Jakarta: Indonesian Institute of Sciences, 2006), pp. 8‚Äì9. The Malay and Javanese also reached Ghana in the 8th century AD. Medieval age of navigation An 18th-century Persian Astrolabe, kept at The Whipple Museum of the History of Science in Cambridge, England. Iceland spar, possibly the Icelandic medieval sunstone used to locate the sun in the sky when obstructed from view. The Arab Empire significantly contributed to navigation, and had trade networks extending from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Indian Ocean and China Sea in the east,Subhi Y. Labib (1969), \\"Capitalism in Medieval Islam\\", The Journal of Economic History 29 (1), p. 79-96. Apart from the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates, navigable rivers in the Islamic regions were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. Islamic geography and navigational sciences made use of a magnetic compass and a rudimentary instrument known as a kamal, used for celestial navigation and for measuring the altitudes and latitudes of the stars. The kamal itself was simple to construct. It was a rectangular piece of either bone or wood which had a string with 9 consecutive knots attached to it. Another instrument available, developed by the Arabs as well, was the quadrant. Also a celestial navigation device, it was originally developed for astronomy and later transitioned to navigation.ThinkQuest: Library, ‚ÄúEarly Navigational Instruments,‚Äù http://library.thinkquest.org/C004706/contents/1stsea/nap/page/n-2.html# When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. However, there are no records of open ocean Atlantic sailing, and their activity focused on Mediterranean, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea and across to the Bay of Bengal.Christides, Vasilios (1988). \\"Naval History and Naval Technology in Medieval Times the Need for Interdisciplinary Studies\\". Byzantion. 58 (2): 309‚Äì332. JSTOR 44171055. Muslim sailors were also responsible for the use and development of the lateen sails and large three-masted merchant vessels to the Mediterranean. The origins of the caravel ship, developed and used for long-distance travel by the Portuguese, and later by the rest of Iberians, since the 15th century, also date back to the qarib used by Andalusian explorers by the 13th century.John M. Hobson (2004), The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation, p. 141, Cambridge University Press, . The sea lanes between India and neighboring lands were the usual form of trade for many centuries, and are responsible for the widespread influence of Indian culture to the societies of Southeast Asia. Powerful navies included those of the Maurya, Satavahana, Chola, Vijayanagara, Kalinga, Maratha and Mughal Empire. Vikings used polarization and the Sunstone to allow navigation of their ships by locating the Sun even in a completely overcast sky. This special mineral was talked about in several 13th ‚Äì 14th- century written sources in Iceland, some centuries after the carbon-dated, early-11th-century Norse settlement of L'Anse aux Meadows in northernmost Newfoundland had been briefly established. In China between 1040 and 1117, the magnetic compass was being developed and applied to navigation.Li Shu-hua, ‚ÄúOrigine de la Boussole 11. Aimant et Boussole,‚Äù Isis, Vol. 45, No. 2. (July 1954), p.181 This let masters continue sailing a course when the weather limited visibility of the sky. The true mariner's compass using a pivoting needle in a dry box was invented in Europe no later than 1300.Frederic C. Lane, ‚ÄúThe Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,‚Äù The American Historical Review, Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff. Nautical charts called portolan charts began to appear in Italy at the end of the 13th century.Chisholm, 1911:285. However, their use did not seem to spread quickly: there are no reports of the use of a nautical chart on an English vessel until 1489. Age of exploration The Fra Mauro map, \\"considered the greatest memorial of medieval cartography\\" according to Roberto Almagi√†Almagi√†, discussing the copy of another map by Fra Mauro, in the Vatican Library: Roberto Almagi√†, Monumenta cartographica vaticana, (Rome 1944) I:32-40. is a map made between 1457 and 1459 by the Venetian monk Fra Mauro. It is a circular planisphere drawn on parchment and set in a wooden frame, about two meters in diameter. cross-staff was an ancient precursor to the modern marine sextant. \\"The light of navigation\\", Dutch sailing handbook, 1608, showing compass, hourglass, sea astrolabe, terrestrial and celestial globes, divider, Jacob's staff and astrolabe. Fairly accurate maps of the Americas were being drawn in the early 17th century. The commercial activities of Portugal in the early 15th century marked an epoch of distinct progress in practical navigation for Europeans. These exploration and trade expeditions sent out by Infante Henrique (later called \\"Henry the Navigator\\") led first to the discovery of Porto Santo Island (near Madeira) in 1418, rediscovery of the Azores in 1427, the discovery of the Cape Verde Islands in 1447 and Sierra Leone in 1462. Combined with the empirical observations gathered in oceanic seafaring, mapping winds and currents, Portuguese explorers took the lead in the long distance oceanic navigation,Kenneth Maxwell, Naked tropics: essays on empire and other rogues, p. 16, Routledge, 2003, opening later, at the beginning of the 16th century, a network of ocean routes covering the Atlantic, the Indian and the western Pacific oceans, from the North Atlantic and South America, to Japan and Southeast Asia. The Portuguese campaign of Atlantic navigation is one the earliest examples of a systematic scientific large project, sustained over many decades. This program of study recruited several men of exceptional ability, had a well-defined set of objectives, and was open to experimental confirmation through the success or otherwise of subsequent navigations. Initial Period - Portuguese exploration of the Atlantic: Duarte Pacheco Pereira The main problem in navigating, by sail alone, back from the south of the Canary Islands (or south of Boujdour), is due to the change in the regime of winds and currents: the North Atlantic gyre and the Equatorial counter current http://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/~jdirnber/oceanography/LecuturesOceanogr/LecCurrents/LecCurrents.html (retrieved 13/06/2020) will push south along the northwest bulge of Africa, while the uncertain winds where the Northeast trades meet the Southeast trades (the doldrums) https://kids.britannica.com/students/assembly/view/166714 (retrieved 13/06/2020) leave a sailing ship to the mercy of the currents. Together, prevalent current and wind make northwards progress very difficult or impossible. In this context, the Portuguese discovered the two large volta do mar (meaning literally turn of the sea but also return from the sea) currents and trade winds of North and of South Atlantic ocean (approximately in the first half and in the late 15th century respectively), that paved the way to reach the New World and return to Europe, as well as to circumnavigate Africa in western open sea, in future voyages of discovery, avoiding contrary winds and currents. The 'rediscovery' of the Azores islands in 1427 is merely a reflection of the heightened strategic importance of the islands, now sitting on the return route from the western coast of Africa (sequentially called 'volta de Guin√©' and 'volta da Mina'); and the references to the Sargasso Sea (also called at the time 'Mar da Baga'), to the west of the Azores, in 1436, reveals the western extent of the return route.Carlos Calinas Correia, A Arte de Navegar na √âpoca dos Descobrimentos, Colibri, Lisboa 2017; To resolve the difficulties involved in thee return trip, a systematic exploration of the coasts and open sea conditions was undertaken, lasting until the final years of the 15th century. An early example of such systematic criteria is found in Duarte Pacheco Pereira, navigator, military commander and learned writer of ‚ÄòEsmeraldo de Situ Orbis‚Äô (1505-1508), where he reports his and other‚Äôs exploration of the African coast and of the open seas of the south Atlantic: In the 'Esmeraldo's introduction: > \\"what belongs to cosmography and seamanship I hope to spell out (‚Ä¶) ...how > does a headland or place lay in respect of another; and this so that this > work takes order and grounding; and the coast may be more safely navigated; > and likewise the knowledge of the lands and where lay the shallows which for > this it is much necessary to know; also of the sounders performed in some > places what their depth is and also the different of the bottoms, if they > are mudd or sand, or stone, or pebbles, or sharp edges, or shells (burgao = > Livona pica) or what quality is such sounding; and being known what is the > distance from the shallows to the coastline; and likewise the tides, if they > are from northeast and southwest like those from our spain, or is they are > from north and south, or west and east, or northwest and southeast, which > for the purpose of entering and exiting ports and river-mouths are > absolutely necessary; and also de measurements from the poles from which can > be known how many degrees are the places apart and the latitude relative to > the equator; and also the nature of the people of this ethiopia (Africa) and > their mode of life and I will also talk about the commerce that could be had > in this land‚Äúho que toca ha cosmografia e marinharia por extenso espero > dizer (‚Ä¶) ... como jaz um promontorio ou lugar com outro e isto porque esta > obra leve hordem e fundamento e ha costa mais seguramente se possa navegar e > o mesmo as conhesensas das terras e asy honde estam as baixas que para isto > he muito necessario saber se; tambem das sondas que √° em alguns lugares em > quanta altura som e asy as deferensas dos fundos .s. se he vasa ou area, ou > pedra, ou saibro, ou harestas, ou burgao ou de que calidade ha tal fonda he > e sendo conhecida quantas leguas aveera daly a terra e o mesmo as mar√©s, se > som de nordeste he sudueste asy como as de nossa espanha, ou se som do > norte, o sul, ou de lest e oest, ou de noroest e suest, as quais para > entrarem e sairem nas barras, e bocas dos Rios som forsadamente necessarias; > e asim as alturas de cada hum dos pollos por onde se pode saber quantos > graaos se cada lugar apartam e ladeza da equinocial e tambem a natureza da > jente desta ethiopia e ho seu modo de viver e asy direi do comercio que > nesta terra pode haver‚Äù The repositories for the observations made were the 'Roteiros' or maritime route-maps. The earliest Roteiro known is part of a collection of several manuscripts by Valentim Fernandes (1485) with the coast up to the delta of the Niger river in present day Nigeria, followed by the 'Esmeraldo...' (1505-08) cited above; several 'roteiros' included in the 'Livro de Marinharia e Tratado da Agulha de Marear' (Treatise of Seamanship and of the magnetic needle) by Jo√£o de Lisboa (1514); roteiros included in the 'Regimento de Navegac√£o...' (Regiment of Navigation) by Andr√© Pires (1520); roteiros for Brazil by Pero Lopes de Sousa (1530-32), Roteiro da Carreira da √çndia' (Route-book of the travel to/from India) by Diogo de Afonso (1536); and the roteiros by D. Jo√£o de Castro (see below): Lisbon to Goa (1538), Goa to Diu (northwest India) (1538-39, and the Red Sea (1541) The extent of the explorations undertaken is again reported in the 'Esmeraldo...', on the 2nd page of the 2nd chapter: > \\"‚Ä¶ Year of our Lord of 1498 where Your Highness commanded us to explore the > western area going past the greatness of the ocean sea; where is found and > explored a very large firm land with many and large adjoining islands, which > extends from seventy degrees of latitude from the equator line towards the > arctic pole (‚Ä¶) and goes further of twenty eight degrees of latitude from > the equator line towards the antarctic pole (‚Ä¶) from any place in Europe or > Africa and going across all the ocean in a straight line to the west by the > rules of seamanship for thirty six degrees of longitude, which are six > hundred and forty eight leagues of route counting at eighteen leagues per > degree.\\" ...hano de nosso senhor de mil quatrocentos noventa e oito donde > nos vossa alteza mandou descobrir ha parte oucidental passando alem ha > grandeza do mar ociano honde he hachada e naveguada huma tam grande terra > firme com muitas e grandes Ilhas adjacentes a ella que se estende a satenta > graaos de ladeza da linha equinocial contra o polo artico (‚Ä¶) e vay alem em > vinte e oito graaos e meo de ladeza contra o pollo antratico (‚Ä¶) de qualquer > outro lugar da europa e dafrica e dasia hatravesando alem todo ho oceano > direitamente ha oucidente ou a loest segundo ordem de marinharia por trinta > e seis graaos de longura que seram seiscentas e quarenta e oyto leguoas de > caminho contando a dezoyto leguoas por graao. It is unlikely that the exploration of the open seas of the southern Atlantic was made in a single voyage, particularly when the route taken by Vasco da Gama in 1497 was significantly different from the one taken by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral in 1500, each being adapted to the season of departure.Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho, As Primeiras Travessia Atl√¢nticas - lecture, Academia Portuguesa de Hist√≥ria, 22/04/1942 - in: Anais (APH) 1949, II serie, vol.2Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho, A Viagem de Bartolomeu Dias, Anais (Clube Militar Naval) May 1946 This adaptation shows an understanding of the cycle of yearly variations in winds and currents in the southern Atlantic. Furthermore, there were systematic expeditions pushing into the western Northern Atlantic (Teive, 1454; Vogado, 1462; Teles, 1474; Ulmo, 1486)Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho, As Primeiras Travessia Atl√¢nticas - lecture, Academia Portuguesa de Hist√≥ria, 22/04/1942 - in: Anais (APH) 1949, II serie, vol.2 The documents relating to the supplying of ships, and the ordering of sun declination tables for the southern Atlantic for as early as 1493-1496,Luis Ad√£o da Fonseca, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral - Uma Viagem, INAPA, Lisboa, 1999, p.48 all suggest a well planned and systematic activity. The most significant consequence of this systematised knowledge was the negotiation of the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, moving the line of demarcation 270 leagues to the west (from 100 to 370 leagues west of the Azores) with the consequence of affirming the Portuguese claim to Brazil and its dominance of the Atlantic. Mature Period - Portuguese exploration of the Indic: Jo√£o de Castro By the early 16th century there were regular voyages between Lisbon and the Indic. The knowledge of the Atlantic developed by accretion, with the systematic exploration moving into the Indic. The corollary of this activity involved a group of remarkable men established around the academic (mathematician, cosmographer) Pedro Nunes, and the explorer and ‚Äòlead investigator‚Äô Jo√£o de Castro (navigator, military commander and Vice-Roy of India); such men included Andre de Resende (scholar), Jo√£o de Barros (chronist and scholar), and possibly Dami√£o de Gois (a diplomat, scholar and friend of Erasmus). The theoretical works of Pedro Nunes (1502-1578) achieved the mathematical determination of the loxodromic curve: the shortest course between two points on the surface of a sphere represented onto a two-dimensional map, clearing the way for the establishment of the Mercator projection.https://mathshistory.st- andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Nunes/ (retrieved 13/06/2020)W.G.L. Randles, \\"Pedro Nunes and the Discovery of the Loxodromic Curve, or How, in the 16th Century, Navigating with a Globe had Failed to Solve the Difficulties Encountered with the Plane Chart,\\" Revista da Universidade Coimbra, 35 (1989), 119-30. It is Pedro Nunes who states, in his comtemporaneous \\"Treatise of the Sphere\\" (1537), that Portuguese navigations were not an adventurous endeavour: > \\"nam se fezeram indo a acertar: mas partiam os nossos mareantes muy > ensinados e prouidos de estromentos e regras de astrologia e geometria que > sam as cousas que os cosmographos ham dadar apercebidas (...) e leuaua > cartas muy particularmente rumadas e na ja as de que os antigos vsauam\\" > (were not done by chance: but our seafarers departed well taught and > provided with instruments and rules of astrology (astronomy) and geometry > which were matters the cosmographers would provide (...) and they took > charts with exact routes and no longer those used by the ancient).Pedro > Nunes Salaciense, Tratado da Esfera, cap. 'Carta de Marear com o Regimento > da Altura' p.2 - > https://archive.org/details/tratadodaspherac00sacr/page/n123/mode/2up > (retrieved 13/06/2020) Nunes credibility rests on being personally involved in the instruction of pilots and senior seafarers from 1527 onwards. Moreover, it was Nunes who developed instruments and instructions for the systematic work of Jo√£o de Castro, as stated by Castro in several of his letters. Jo√£o de Castro's work took place along the route of the Indian Ocean (1538), particularly the Arabian sea with the Persian gulf and the Red Sea (1538-9 and 1541). While his study of the coast, navigation and winds and currents is rigorous and accurate, it is his research on terrestrial magnetism in the Atlantic and Indian oceans that came to be celebrated: > \\"D. Joao de Castro carried out a series of experiments that succeeded in > detecting phenomena, in particular related to magnetism and the magnetic > needle on board. It should be assumed that such knowledge to Pedro Nunes, of > course the direct inspiration of all the observations he has done in his > travels. When on August 5, 1538, D. Jo√£o de Castro decided to determine the > latitude of Mozambique, found the cause that dictated the astonishing > uneasiness of needles; noted the deviation of the needle, discovering it 128 > years before Dennis Guillaume (1666) of Nieppe, which is recorded in History > of Sailing as if he were the first to know about this phenomenon. His point > near Ba√ßaim, on December 22, 1538, a magnetic phenomenon, for which there > were variations of the needle because of the proximity of certain rocks, > confirmed four centuries later, was called local attraction. D. Jo√£o de > Castro refuted the theory that the variation of magnetic declination is not > formed by geographic meridians. His comments are the most important record > of values of magnetic declination in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, in the > sixteenth century, and useful for the study of terrestrial magnetism. It was > one of the personalities of this century European experimental science, > linking the importance of this study with the sailing.\\" King John II of Portugal continued this effort, forming a committee on navigation. This group computed tables of the sun's declination and improved the mariner's astrolabe, believing it a good replacement for the cross-staff. These resources improved the ability of a navigator at sea to judge his latitude. Castilian Jew Abraham Zacut, the author of an exceptional treatise on astronomy/astrology in Hebrew, with the title Ha-jibbur Ha-gadol, fled to Portugal in 1492. He published in the printing press of Leiria in 1496, the book Biur Luhoth, or in Latin Almanach Perpetuum, which was soon translated into Latin and Spanish. In this book were the astronomical tables (ephemerides) for the years 1497 to 1500, which may have been instrumental, together with the new astrolabe, made of metal and not wood as before (created and perfected at the beginning of the Portuguese discoveries), to Vasco da Gama and Pedro √Ålvares Cabral in their voyages to India (also passing through South America) around the open Atlantic ocean (including the Southwest Atlantic) and in the Indian Ocean. Nevertheless, the Portuguese had to hire local pilots in the Indian Ocean for several decades to guide their ships. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Crown of Castile and then the \\"unified\\" Crown of Spain was also in the vanguard of European global exploration and colonial expansion. The Spanish Crown opened trade routes across the oceans, specially the transatlantic expeditions of Christopher Columbus on behalf of Castile, from 1492. The Crown of Castile, under Charles I of Spain, also sponsored the first expedition of world circumnavigation in 1521. The enterprise was led by Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan and completed by the Spanish Basque Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano. The trips of exploration led to trade flourishing across the Atlantic Ocean between Spain and America and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia-Pacific and Mexico via the Philippines. Later, Andr√©s de Urdaneta discovered the northern Pacific's volta do mar return voyage. The compass, a cross-staff or astrolabe, a method to correct for the altitude of Polaris and rudimentary nautical charts were all the tools available to a navigator at the time of Christopher Columbus. In his notes on Ptolemy's geography, Johannes Werner of Nurenberg wrote in 1514 that the cross-staff was a very ancient instrument, but was only beginning to be used on ships. Prior to 1577, no method of judging the ship's speed was mentioned that was more advanced than observing the size of the vessel's bow wave or the passage of sea foam or various floating objects.May, William Edward, A History of Marine Navigation, G. T. Foulis & Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, In 1577, a more advanced technique was mentioned: the chip log. In 1578, a patent was registered for a device that would judge the ship's speed by counting the revolutions of a wheel mounted below the ship's waterline. Accurate time- keeping is necessary for the determination of longitude. As early as 1530, precursors to modern techniques were being explored. However, the most accurate clocks available to these early navigators were water clocks and sand clocks, such as hourglass. Hourglasses were still in use by the Royal Navy of Britain until 1839 for the timing of watches. Continuous accumulation of navigational data, along with increased exploration and trade, led to increased production of volumes through the Middle Ages. \\"Routiers\\" were produced in France about 1500; the English referred to them as \\"rutters.\\" In 1584 Lucas Waghenaer published the Spieghel der Zeevaerdt (The Mariner's Mirror), which became the model for such publications for several generations of navigators. They were known as \\"Waggoners\\" by most sailors. In 1537, Pedro Nunes published his Tratado da Sphera. In this book he included two original treatises about questions of navigation. For the first time the subject was approached using mathematical tools. This publication gave rise to a new scientific discipline: \\"theoretical or scientific navigation\\". In 1545, Pedro de Medina published the influential Arte de navegar. The book was translated into French, Italian, Dutch and English. In 1569, Gerardus Mercator published for the first time a world map in such a cartographic projection that constant-rhumb trajectories were plotted as straight lines. This Mercator projection would be widely used for nautical charts from the 18th century onward. In 1594, John Davis published an 80-page pamphlet called The Seaman's Secrets which, among other things describes great circle sailing. It's said that the explorer Sebastian Cabot had used great circle methods in a crossing of the North Atlantic in 1495. Davis also gave the world a version of the backstaff, the Davis quadrant, which became one of the dominant instruments from the 17th century until the adoption of the sextant in the 19th century. In 1599, Edward Wright published Certaine Errors in Navigation, which translated the work of Pedro Nunes explaining the mathematical basis of the Mercator projection\\"the errors I poynt at in the chart, have beene heretofore poynted out by others, especially by Petrus Nonius, out of whom most part of the first Chapter of the Treatise following is almost worde for worde translated;\\" - in: Edward Wright, with calculated mathematical tables which made it possible to use in practice. The book made clear why only with this projection would a constant bearing correspond to a straight line on a chart. It also analysed other sources of error, including the risk of parallax errors with some instruments; and faulty estimates of latitude and longitude on contemporary charts. In 1599/1600, Edward Wright's World Chart of 1599 was the first map under the Mercator projection drawn by an Englishman for English navigation. The map prominently displays the Queen Elizabeth I Privy Seal; the only one of her realm to carry her private seal. The Molyneux 1592 globe is the only other cartography with her Privy Seal. Both identify Nova Albion, the land Captain Francis Drake claimed for his Queen during his 1577-1580 circumnavigation, above the 40th parallel. In 1631, Pierre Vernier described his newly invented quadrant that was accurate to one minute of arc.Chisholm, 1911:287. In theory, this level of accuracy could give a line of position within a nautical mile of the navigator's actual position. In 1635, Henry Gellibrand published an account of yearly change in magnetic variation.Chisholm, 1911:288. In 1637, using a specially built astronomical sextant with a 5-foot radius, Richard Norwood measured the length of a nautical mile with chains.Chisholm, 1911:289. His definition of 2,040 yards is fairly close to the modern International System of Units (SI) definition of 2,025.372 yards. Norwood is also credited with the discovery of magnetic dip 59 years earlier, in 1576. Modern times Edmond Halley's 1701 map charting magnetic variation from true north In 1714 the British Commissioners for the discovery of longitude at sea came into prominence.Chisholm, 1911:290. This group, which existed until 1828, offered grants and rewards for the solution of navigational problems. Between 1737 and 1828, the commissioners disbursed some ¬£101,000. The government of the United Kingdom also offered significant rewards for navigational accomplishments in this era, such as ¬£20,000 for the discovery of the Northwest Passage and ¬£5,000 for the navigator that could sail within a degree of latitude of the North Pole. A widespread manual in the 18th century was Navigatio Britannica by John Barrow, published in 1750 by March & Page and still being advertised in 1787.ODNB entry for John Barrow (fl. 1735‚Äì1774): Retrieved 18 July 2011. Subscription required. Isaac Newton invented a reflecting quadrant around 1699.Newton, I., ‚ÄúNewton's Octant‚Äù (posthumous description), Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, vol. 42, p. 155, 1742 He wrote a detailed description of the instrument for Edmond Halley, which was published in 1742. Due to this time lapse, credit for the invention has often been given instead to John Hadley and Thomas Godfrey. The octant eventually replaced earlier cross-staffs and Davis quadrants, and had the immediate effect of making latitude calculations much more accurate. A highly important breakthrough for the accurate determination of longitude came with the invention of the marine chronometer. The 1714 longitude prize offer for a method of determining longitude at sea, was won by John Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter. He submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force, which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea. Harrison solved the precision problems with his much smaller H4 chronometer design in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12 cm) diameter pocket watch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the ¬£20,000 longitude prize. His design used a fast- beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring. These features remained in use until stable electronic oscillators allowed very accurate portable timepieces to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the Board of Longitude published a description of his work in The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper. In 1757, John Bird invented the first sextant. This replaced the Davis quadrant and the octant as the main instrument for navigation. The sextant was derived from the octant in order to provide for the lunar distance method. With the lunar distance method, mariners could determine their longitude accurately. Once chronometer production was established in the late 18th century, the use of the chronometer for accurate determination of longitude was a viable alternative. Chronometers replaced lunars in wide usage by the late 19th century. In 1891 radios, in the form of wireless telegraphs, began to appear on ships at sea. In 1899 the R.F. Matthews was the first ship to use wireless communication to request assistance at sea. Using radio for determining direction was investigated by \\"Sir Oliver Lodge, of England; Andre Blondel, of France; De Forest, Pickard; and Stone, of the United States; and Bellini and Tosi, of Italy.\\" The Stone Radio & Telegraph Company installed an early prototype radio direction finder on the naval collier Lebanon in 1906. By 1904 time signals were being sent to ships to allow navigators to check their chronometers. The U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office was sending navigational warnings to ships at sea by 1907. Later developments included the placing of lighthouses and buoys close to shore to act as marine signposts identifying ambiguous features, highlighting hazards and pointing to safe channels for ships approaching some part of a coast after a long sea voyage. In 1912 Nils Gustaf Dal√©n was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of automatic valves designed to be used in combination with gas accumulators in lighthouses 1921 saw the installation of the first radiobeacon.Bowditch, 2002:8. The first prototype shipborne radar system was installed on the USS Leary in April 1937. On November 18, 1940 Mr. Alfred L. Loomis made the initial suggestion for an electronic air navigation system which was later developed into LORAN (long range navigation system) by the Radiation Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and on November 1, 1942 the first LORAN System was placed in operation with four stations between the Chesapeake Capes and Nova Scotia. A 1943 United States military map of world ocean currents and ice packs, as they were known at the time. In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik. Scientists at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory took a series of measurements of Sputnik's doppler shift yielding the satellite's position and velocity. This team continued to monitor Sputnik and the next satellites into space, Sputnik II and Explorer I. In March 1958 the idea of working backwards, using known satellite orbits to determine an unknown position on the Earth's surface began to be explored. This led to the TRANSIT satellite navigation system. The first TRANSIT satellite was placed in polar orbit in 1960. The system, consisting of 7 satellites, was made operational in 1962. A navigator using readings from three satellites could expect accuracy of about 80 feet. On July 14, 1974 the first prototype Navstar GPS satellite was put into orbit, but its clocks failed shortly after launch. The Navigational Technology Satellite 2, redesigned with cesium clocks, started to go into orbit on June 23, 1977. By 1985, the first 11-satellite GPS Block I constellation was in orbit. Satellites of the similar Russian GLONASS system began to be put into orbit in 1982, and the system is expected to have a complete 24-satellite constellation in place by 2010. The European Space Agency expects to have its Galileo with 30 satellites in place by 2011/12 as well. Integrated bridge systems Electronic integrated bridge concepts are driving future navigation system planning.Bowditch, 2002:1. Integrated systems take inputs from various ship sensors, electronically display positioning information, and provide control signals required to maintain a vessel on a preset course. The navigator becomes a system manager, choosing system presets, interpreting system output, and monitoring vessel response.

The text is based upon his readings in archeology and anthropology; anything not covered by these disciplines is then dealt with using Jungian methods of dream analysis and the theory of archetypes. For instance, his remarks concerning the nature of life in prehistory are largely derived from his interpretations of the dreams of psychotherapy patients. Subject matter Eisler begins with an investigation into sadism and masochism which concludes that people seek not pleasure so much as strong sensations. Whether one seeks strong pleasurable sensations, unpleasurable ones, or some combination thereof depends on which group of apes one is descended from. He asserts that humanity evolved from two groups of apes: one peaceful, vegetarian and practicing free love; the other violent, carnivorous and given to fighting over sex partners. Originally all were of the former group. However, Eisler argues that Ice Age food shortages caused some to imitate wolves and other beasts of prey, wearing animal skins and taking up hunting. He claims this is the historical basis of the werewolf legends found in many cultures. Eisler advocates a return to what he imagines was the harmonious life of the earliest primates and proposes the development of a new psychology and ultimately a new society, lest we are destroyed in a nuclear war brought about by descendants of the wolf-men.

The extremely high fineness ratio of the fuselage is evident. Questair Venture, with an egg-shaped, very-low-fineness- ratio fuselage In naval architecture and aerospace engineering, the fineness ratio is the ratio of the length of a body to its maximum width. Shapes that are short and wide have a low fineness ratio, those that are long and narrow have high fineness ratios. Aircraft that spend time at supersonic speeds, e.g. the Concorde, generally have high fineness ratios. At speeds below critical mach, one of the primary forms of drag is skin friction. As the name implies, this is drag caused by the interaction of the airflow with the aircraft's skin. To minimize this drag, the aircraft should be designed to minimize the exposed skin area, or \\"wetted surface\\". One solution to this problem is constructing an \\"egg shaped\\" fuselage, for example as used on the home-built Questair Venture. Theoretical ideal fineness ratios in subsonic aircraft fuselages are typically found at about 6:1, however this may be compromised by other design considerations such as seating or freight size requirements. Because a higher fineness fuselage can have reduced tail surfaces, this ideal ratio can practically be increased to 8:1. Most aircraft have fineness ratios significantly greater than this, however. This is often due to the competing need to place the tail control surfaces at the end of a longer moment arm to increase their effectiveness. Reducing the length of the fuselage would require larger controls, which would offset the drag savings from using the ideal fineness ratio. An example of a high-performance design with an imperfect fineness ratio is the Lancair. In other cases, the designer is forced to use a non-ideal design due to outside factors such as seating arrangements or cargo pallet sizes. Modern airliners often have fineness ratios much higher than ideal, a side effect of their cylindrical cross- section which is selected for strength, as well as providing a single width to simplify seating layout and air cargo handling. As an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, shock waves form on areas of greater curvature. These shock waves radiate away energy that the engines must supply, energy that does not go into making the aircraft go faster. This appears to be a new form of drag‚Äîreferred to as wave drag‚Äîwhich peaks at about three times the drag at speeds even slightly below the critical mach. In order to minimize the wave drag, the curvature of the aircraft should be kept to a minimum, which implies much higher fineness ratios. This is why high-speed aircraft have long pointed noses and tails, and cockpit canopies that are flush to the fuselage line. More technically, the best possible performance for a supersonic design is typified by two \\"perfect shapes\\", the Sears-Haack body which is pointed at both ends, or the von K√°rm√°n ogive, which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the Concorde, F-104 Starfighter and XB-70 Valkyrie, although to some degree practically every post-World War II interceptor aircraft featured such a design. Missile designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher fineness ratios than most aircraft. The introduction of aircraft with higher fineness ratios also introduced a new form of instability, inertial coupling. As the engines and cockpit moved away from the aircraft's center of mass, the roll inertia of these masses grew to be able to overwhelm the power of the aerodynamic surfaces. A variety of methods are used to combat this effect, including oversized controls and stability augmentation systems.

Designed to succeed the Yak-17UTI, it also led to the development of the Yakovlev Yak-32 sport jet. The Yak-30 lost to the L-29 Delfin, and neither it nor the Yak-32 entered production.Gunston, 1997 Design and development In 1959 the Soviet Air Force held a competition for the first purpose-built jet trainer to enter service with the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact nations. Prior to this, all Soviet jet trainers, such as the Yakovlev Yak-17UTI, had been modified from existing jet fighters. Since Yakovlev had produced most of the Soviet Union's trainer aircraft since World War II, winning the competition was extremely important, as the winner would be produced extensively for many years. Yakovlev's entry in the competition was the Yak-30. Surprisingly, it was the only competitor from within the Soviet Union.Gunston, 1997 The Yak-30 was an all-metal aircraft made entirely from light alloys. It was designed to be easy and inexpensive to build, the two wing spars being made from pressed-sheet ribs. The simple, elliptical fuselage housed the pupil and instructor in a single unpressurized tandem cockpit. Fuel was limited to 600 liters (132 gallons) in a bag tank located in the fuselage above the wing.Gunston, 1997 The engine was the Turmanskii-designed RU-19, made especially for the aircraft. Like the rest of the aircraft, it was simply designed, a single- shaft turbojet with a seven-stage axial compressor, rated at 900 kg (1,984 lbs) thrust. Air was fed from very small inlets located in the wing roots, and discharged directly under the rear fuselage with no jetpipe. To ease servicing, the engine could be lowered straight down without disturbing the fuselage.Gunston, 1997 The tailplane was fixed halfway up the sharply-swept fin, and all control surfaces were manually driven by rods which ran down a dorsal spine extending along the upper surface of the aircraft, ending at the rear of the canopy. The long, continuous canopy was of blown Plexiglas, and bulged to give a better downward view. It slid to the rear on long rails. The ejection seats could both be fired by the instructor, while the pupil could fire only his own seat. Both cockpit positions had a complete set of controls.Gunston, 1997 The tricycle undercarriage was retractable. The main units retracted inward, while the steerable nosewheel retracted forwards into a bay covered by two doors. Though provisions were made for armament similar to the military version of the single-seat Yakovlev Yak-32, no armament was placed on the four prototypes.Gunston, 1997 The technical manager on the program was K V Sinelshcikov. Chief engineers were V A Shavrin, V G Tsvelov and V P Vlasov.Gunston, 1997 Operational history The OKB built a single static/fatigue test airframe, as well as four flying prototypes (callsigns 30, 50, 80 and 90). Two Yak-32's were also assembled at the same time.Gunston, 1997 Yakovlev Yak-30 (RA-0841G) Factory testing took place from 20 May 1960 through March 1961. A total of 82 flights were made with 43 hours 36 minutes of flight time. No difficulties in operating the aircraft were found. The competition ultimately came down to three aircraft, the rivals being the Czechoslovak L-29 Delfin, and the Polish TS-11 Iskra. The Iskra was quickly eliminated and sent back to Poland, leaving the Yak-30 in a head-to-head competition with the L-29, in which the Yak design showed far better performance, including lower weight, better maneuverability and lower production costs. However, in the end, a political decision was reached to select the more robust Czechoslovak L-29 in August 1961 to serve as the primary jet trainer for all Soviet and Warsaw Pact nations except for Poland. Immediately after this decision OKB pilot Smirnov set several official light jet world records in the Yak-30.Gunston, 1997 These included speed over a 25 kilometer course (767.308 km/h), and maximum altitude of 16,128 meters. One of the surviving prototypes is on display at the Central Air Force Museum, at Monino, outside of Moscow.

Since January 2017, Heifetz has been serving as the Ambassador of the State of Israel to the People‚Äôs Republic of China and Mongolia. Heifetz previously served as Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ambassador to Austria, UNIDO, UNDOC and OSCE, and Ambassador to Russian Federation. Heifetz was born in Tomsk, Siberia, where his family had been exiled to from Riga, Latvia, in 1940. His grandfather, Ya‚Äôakov Jedeikin, was executed by the Stalin regime due to his involvement in Zionist activities and donating money to Jewish organizations in Palestine. Jedeikin was later granted the title of a ‚ÄúMartyr‚Äù by the State of Israel for these activities. At the age of eleven months, Heifetz and his family returned to Riga, (then still a part of the USSR). In 1971, the family immigrated to Israel, first settled in Givat HaMoreh and later moved to Petah Tikva. Heifetz served for seven years in the Israeli Intelligence Corps of the IDF (unit 8200), and was discharged as a Major. He obtained his law degree from Tel Aviv University and is a member of the Israeli Bar Association (1985). Heifetz was a partner in the law firm \\"Osnat Heifetz and Co.\\" In 1989, Heifetz was posted to Moscow as a member the ‚ÄúGroup of Israeli Diplomats under the Dutch Embassy in the USSR‚Äù, as part of the first steps towards reinstating diplomatic relations between Israel and the Soviet Union after they were severed in 1967. From 1990 to 1996, Heifetz served as an external legal adviser to the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office consulting on affairs related to the former Soviet Union. From the early 1990's, Heifetz's law office specialized in handling international business transactions, mostly representing Israeli companies conducting business in the former USSR and Eastern Europe, as well as companies from the former USSR in Israel and the rest of the world. Among his clients was the Russian-Jewish media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, whom he represented in various international and domestic transaction and cases. From 1999 to 2004, Heifetz was the acting Vice Chairman of Marriv Holdings Ltd, and from 2001 to 2003 he was the acting Chairman of Head Arzi Ltd (major music production company). He was also involved in managing Hapoel Tel Aviv basketball team. Heifetz is a close friend of Sir Leonard (Len) Blavatnik. He was appointed by Sir Leonard Blavatnik as Director on the Board of Clal Industries Ltd., Hadera Paper Ltd. and Beit Shemesh Engines Ltd. In 2004, Heifetz was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom. However, his deployment was delayed due to a petition filed with the High Court of Justice by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, claiming that Heifetz was appointed due to his ties with then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The Supreme Court rejected the petition, and Heifetz went on to serve as Ambassador to the United Kingdom from June 2004 until November 2007. In 2005, it was published in the media that Heifetz received information which prevented the arrest of retired Major-General Doron Almog, who arrived in London for a charity event for children with special needs. Following the end of his UK posting, Heifetz became an advisor to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, then the Special Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East. During this period, Heifetz returned to his businesses and legal work, while also serving as a strategic consultant on international affairs. From 2013 to 2015, Heifetz served as the Israeli Ambassador to Austria and the international organizations (UNIDO and UNDOC) in Vienna, as well as Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). During this time, Heifetz was awarded the ‚ÄúGrand Decoration of Honor in Gold with Sash‚Äù by the President of the Republic of Austria for his service to the country. This state decoration is the highest honor awarded in Austria (excluding acting Heads of States). At this time, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also awarded this decoration. In November 2015, Heifetz was appointed Ambassador to the Russian Federation. During that time, the Russian government began its involvement in Syria, which significantly reshaped its relations with Israel. In June 2016, Heifetz held an event marking the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Russia and Israel. This event was held at the Bolshoi Theatre, and was attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following the request of Prime Minister Netanyahu which was granted by President Putin during a previous meeting between the leaders, Heifetz facilitated the return of an Israeli tank, that was believed to have been used by the MIA soldiers in the ‚ÄúBattle of Sultan Yacoub‚Äù during the 1982 Lebanon War. The tank was seized by Syrian armed forces during the battle and was transferred to the USSR for further examination of its capabilities. During this celebratory visit in June 2016, the Tank was transferred to Israel. Following the return of the tank to Israel it was placed in the Yad La-Shiryon Memorial, The Armored Corps Memorial Site and Museum, as a monument for the Israeli soldiers that were declared missing in action during that battle. The Israeli Embassy in Moscow, under the leadership of Heifetz, was given the award ‚ÄúExemplary Embassy‚Äù by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2016. During the same year, Heifetz was also awarded a decoration from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for his significant personal role in strengthening the relations between Russia and Israel. In January 2017, Heifetz was appointed Ambassador to the People‚Äôs Republic of China and Mongolia. In March 2017, Prime Minister Netanyahu made an official visit to China in order to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two countries. On this occasion, both countries signed a Comprehensive Innovation Partnership Agreement. In January 2019, the Mongolian government awarded Heifetz a medal for his assistance and aid to the Mongolian police force. Heifetz is married to Sigalia, between them the couple has seven children.

In 1782, John and his wife Elizabeth boarded a ship from Jamaica to England, but the ship was lost at sea, and Charles inherited his father's wealthy properties in Jamaica.Barry Higman, Montpelier (Kingston: University of the West Indies Press, 1998), pp. 22-5.  Career as a sugar planter  George Rose Ellis married Anne, the daughter of Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet, but George died without issue in 1815, and his property passed to Charles. Charles was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and he became an absentee planter based in England.Higman, Montpelier, p. 24. Charles inherited the Montpelier estate, while his older brother, also named John, inherited their father's properties in the parishes of St Mary and St George.Higman, Montpelier, p. 29. John married another daughter of Parker, named Antoinette, but died heavily in debt in 1832, and his properties were acquired by Charles.Higman, Montpelier, p. 31. When the British government emancipated the slaves in the 1830s, Charles was compensated for his liberated slaves to the tune of over ¬£16.000.Higman, Montpelier, p. 53.  Political career  Charles Ellis was elected to the House of Commons for Heytesbury in 1793, a seat he held until 1796, and then represented Seaford from 1796 to 1806 and from 1812 to 1826 and East Grinstead from 1807 to 1812. In 1826 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Seaford, of Seaford in the County of Sussex. In parliament, Ellis was a prominent defender of slavery in the West Indies plantations. He was for many years considered to be the head of West India Interest, the lobby of planters and merchants in the British parliament who opposed the abolitionists.Higman, Montpelier, p. 32.  Emancipation and imported labour  In 1832, Ellis was in Jamaica during a slave rebellion led by Samuel Sharpe, the Baptist War resulted in Ellis suffering losses on his sugar plantations to the tune of about ¬£41,000.HIgman, Montpelier, p. 35. Lord Seaford left Jamaica for Britain in the middle of 1834, just before the Apprenticeship period was implemented following the emancipation of the slaves.Higman, Montpelier, p. 55. According to the Legacies of British Slave- Ownership at the University College London, Seaford was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a ¬£15 million loan (worth ¬£ in ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Seaford was associated with five different claims, he owned 1018 slaves in Jamaica and received a ¬£18,124 payment at the time (worth ¬£ in ). Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Lord Seaford was not convinced that the Apprenticeship would work, and he was a great believer in encouraging white European immigration to Jamaica. To this end, he donated land from his Montpelier estate, which was used to create a village for recently arrived German immigrants, called Seaford Town, Jamaica after him.Higman, Montpelier, p. 55.  Death and legacy  Lord Seaford died in July 1845. He had married the Hon. Elizabeth Catherine Caroline Hervey, daughter of John Hervey, Lord Hervey, eldest son of Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, in 1798. She died in January 1803, aged 22. They had 2 sons and a daughter.Higman, Montpelier, p. 31. In 1798 their four-year- old son and heir Charles succeeded his great-grandfather Lord Bristol as sixth Baron Howard de Walden. Their second son was the army officer Augustus Frederick Ellis. References * *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition).

The group was founded by Jumma Khan Marri in 1964 in Damascus, and played an important role in the 1968-1973 insurgency in Sistan and Baluchestan province of Iran and 1973-1977 insurgency in Balochistan province of Pakistan. However, the group was defeated in both the insurgency by Pakistan and Iran and the status of the group became unknown until 2004. The group re-emerged in 2004 after Allah Nazar Baloch took command of the group in 2003. Since then the group has took responsibility for attacks on civilians, journalists, government officials and military personnel. History The group was founded by Jumma Khan Marri in 1964 in Damascus, Syria. Four years after its formation, the group took part in Iranian Baloch revolt against the government of Iran. During this time Iraqi government publicly supported and provided Baluch Liberation Front (BLF) with weapons and operational support. However, after five years of fighting, BLF and other Baloch militant groups were decimated by Iran. The militant groups negotiated an end to fighting with government of Iran and Iraq stopped openly supporting BLF with arms support. However, government of Iraq still maintained relation with group's leadership. Following the end of conflict with Iran, BLF and other Baloch militant groups started inciting insurgency against the government of Pakistan from 1973 to 1977. Initially Iraqi government covertly provided BLF and other militant groups with arms and ammunition. Indian journalist, Avinash Paliwal, states that during the 1970s, Junior level Indian intelligence officials were actively involved in operations in Balochistan. Those officers state that \\"we gave Baloch everything, from money to guns, during the 1970s, everything\\". On 10 February 1973, Pakistani government raided Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and uncovered crates of small arms and ammunition that were allegedly being supplied to BLF and other militant groups. In response, Pakistani government launched military operation against BLF which pushed BLF out of Balochistan into Afghanistan by the end of 1974. Republic of Afghanistan was sanctuary for all anti-Pakistani militant groups and from 1975-1980, it was estimated that Republic of Afghanistan provided BLF members based in Afghanistan with $875,000 annually. While in exile in Afghanistan, Soviet Union also allegedly helped BLF to regroup, allowing it rejoin 1973 to 1977 insurgency. The insurgency came to an end in November 1977 with government of Pakistan emerging victorious. From 1977 to 2004, BLF status was unknown. However, according to reports, BLF did not disband. The group re- emerged in 2004 after Allah Nazar Baloch took command of the group in 2003. In 2015, The Hindu newspaper reported that it was contacted by Baluch Liberation Front (BLF). BLF confirmed its growing connections with India Attacks The group is responsible for attack on civilian, journalist, government officials and military personnel in Balochistan since it re-emerged in 2004. The group along with another terrorist group named Baloch Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for killing 27 Journalists out of the total 38 journalists killed in Balochistan province since 2007. Some other attacks for which group has claimed responsibility for are: In August 2012, Reporters without borders announced that BBC‚Äôs Urdu service correspondent in Quetta Ayub Tareen has been threatened by the BLF for his perceived partisan reporting on the group's political activities.BBC CORRESPONDENT IN QUETTA THREATENED BY BALOCH LIBERATION FRONT Reporters without borders, 1 August 2012 On early 27 July 2013, gunmen attacked a coastguard checkpost in Suntsar, Gwadar District. The attack was carried out by 24 armed gunmen which resulted in death of seven coast guards and injured seven others. Two injured coast guards were also kidnapped by the militants. Baluch Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack on the coastguard checkpost. BLF also stated that two of their militants were also killed in the attack. In 12 April 2015, 20 construction workers from Punjab and Sindh province were gunned down in Turbat by armed gunmen, which the BLF later claimed responsibility for. After the attack, the Home Minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti claimed that Indian intelligence agencies were involved in supporting the BLF in carrying out such attacks.\\"20 labourers gunned down in Turbat\\" Dawn, 12 April 2015 BLF claimed that the workers were members of Frontier Works Organization, which is a body linked to the Pakistani Army. On 16 November 2017, the bullet-riddled bodies of 15 migrants were discovered in the city of Turbat. Security officials state that while attempting to cross the border, the migrants were kidnapped by armed men who later killed them. The BLF later claimed responsibility for the murder of the 15 migrants. The mastermind of the attack, Younas Taukali, was killed by Pakistani security forces in November 2017. Younas Taukali was one of the top eight commanders of Baluch Liberation Front.

Her debut novel, Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile, based on the life and work of Bradford playwright Andrea Dunbar, was published by Fleet. The Spectator said this literary portrayal mixed fiction and biography in the manner of Gordon Burn, and 'restores Dunbar to the place and time that made her ‚Äî the north of England of the 1970s and 1980s.' The novel was shortlisted for the Gordon Burn Prize, received the Society of Authors' K Blundell Trust Award for Fiction, and was shortlisted for the Portico Prize, an award for \\"outstanding literature that best evokes the spirit of the north.\\" In 2019 The Guardian featured the stage adaptation of Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile with Freedom Studios and screenwriter Lisa Holdsworth. The play toured across theatres, working men's clubs and informal venues in Yorkshire and was positively reviewed in the national media. The Stage said the play was 'poignant and resonant ‚Ä¶ a relevant and emotive caution against the one-size- fits-all approach of the privileged theatre industry'. In 2019, Stripe announced a music journalism edition with Rough Trade Books, Sweating Tears with Fat White Family, featuring interviews with Lias Saoudi and Saul Adamczewski of Fat White Family. Previously, Stripe was primarily a poet, and was affiliated with the Offbeat generation. She published three poetry collections; Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid, Cigarettes in Bed and Dark Corners of the Land. In 2006, alongside Tony O'Neill and Ben Myers she formed possibly the first literary movement spawned via a social networking site, the Brutalists, who the BBC described as a 'group of young writers with a back-to- basics approach to poetry'. The Humber Star, her poem based on the experiences of women in 19th century Hessle Road, was performed at John Grant's North Atlantic Flux, for Hull UK City of Culture 2017.

Pleuromeia dominated vegetation during the Early Triassic all over Eurasia and elsewhere. Its sedimentary context in monospecific assemblages on immature paleosols, is evidence that it was an opportunistic pioneer plant that grew on mineral soils with little competition. It spread to high latitudes with greenhouse climatic conditions following the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Conifers reoccurred in the Early Anisian, followed by the cycads and pteridosperms during the Late Anisian.Zi-qiang, W. (1996), \\"Recovery of vegetation from the terminal Permian mass extinction in North China\\", Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology vol. 91, issues 1-4, pp 121-142  Description  Lower part of a stem of Pleuromeia sternbergi'Pleuromeia is an herbaceous plant that lacks secondary tissues and has an unbranched stem of 30 cm long and 2‚Äì3 cm wide in the earliest species to around 2 metres long in later species. The stem may have carried small microphylls that are discarded in the lower part of the stem, but may also be leafless, depending on the species or environmental circumstances. It had a 2-4 lobed bulbous base to which numerous adventive roots are attached. Pleuromeia produced a single large cone at the tip of the stem or in some species many smaller cones. The top of the cone carries microsporophylls, the lower part megasporophylls, and both types may intercallated midlength. Sporophylls are disposed from the bottom up. Both types are obovate, with a round to ovoid sporangium and a tongue-like extension nearer to the tip on the upper/inner side. The trilete microspores are hollow, round and 30‚Äì40 Œºm in diameter. Megaspores have a layered outer skin with a small trilete mark, are also hollow, round to ovoid and up to 300‚Äì400 Œºm in diameter. The anatomy of the spores in Pleuromeia is comparable to that of Isoetes and substantiates the assumed close relationship between the Pleuromeiaceae and the Isoetaceae.  Ecology  Dense populations of Pleuromeia hardly allowing for other species, are recorded around the world from habitats ranging from semi-arid to tidal.  Taxonomy  It has been suggested that Sadovnikovia (Kungurian) is the common ancestor of both the Isoetaceae and the Pleuromeiaceae. The earliest species of the extant genus Isoetes is known from the Lower Triassic, its extinct sister genus Annalepis occurs later during the Triassic. The Pleuromeiaceae seems to be represented by the subsequent development of the genera Viatcheslavia (Roadian), Signacularia (Wordian), Pleuromeia (Induan to Anisian) and Ferganodendron (Ladinian‚ÄìCarnian) from each other.  History of discovery  When the Cathedral of Magdeburg was under repair during the 1830s, a block of sandstone crashed and split open, revealing a fragment of the stem of Pleuromeia sternbergi. This was described by George Graf zu Munster in 1839 as a species of Sigillaria. Corda later assigned the species to the new genus Pleuromeya. The sandstone had been mined in a quarry near Bernburg (Saale) where later on numerous specimens of Pleuromeia were found, including cones. P. sternbergi has since been found in other Lower and Middle Buntsandstein deposits elsewhere in Germany, France and Spain. Other species have been described from several localities in Russia, Australia, South America and Japan.

Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre, or as it is more commonly known, BEAST, is a sound diffusion system specifically designed for the performance of electroacoustic music. It is a long-running project of the Electroacoustic Music Studios at the University of Birmingham, founded in 1982 under the directorship of Jonty Harrison. Since 2014 BEAST has been directed by Scott Wilson, along with Annie Mahtani and James Carpenter as technical director. Simply put, it consists of a set of loudspeakers connected to a computer, usually controlled by a diffusion console. The loudspeakers BEAST can consist of up to over 100 channels of loudspeakers, often arranged largely in pairs or rings,, and includes ultra-low frequency loudspeakers (bins) and custom-built trees of high frequency speakers (tweeter trees) which can be suspended above an audience. The minimum set-up that BEAST would ordinarily use for stereo diffusion comprises a set of loudspeakers which Jonty Harrison terms the Main Eight. These four pairs of loudspeakers, using BEAST nomenclature, are termed Main, Wide, Distant and Rear. The Main and the Wide speakers together form the main, frontal sound image, the Main speakers being placed to act somewhat like the loudspeakers in a typical studio, and the Wide speakers acting to stretch that sound image out across the audience's sound stage. The Rear speakers, which are behind the audience, provide immersion and the possibility of movement around the audience. Finally, the Distant speakers, which are positioned to hold their image behind the Main speakers, create a sound whose perspective is distant to that of the Main pair. Other speakers are added to this Main Eight to allow additional possibilities for sound movement and differing sound perspectives. More recent work with BEAST has explored the possibilities offered by 'massively multichannel' approaches to composition, and 'n-channel' work. The diffusion console BEAST is a dynamic system: during a performance the performer operates an often custom-built console, called the diffusion console, with which he or she can individually and dynamically control the level of each loudspeaker, or groups of loudspeakers. This enables him or her to actively articulate the piece's implied spatial sound detail within the real space of the performance venue, in order to realise and interpret the composer's intentions. The system also includes equipment for the live processing of sounds so that, for instance, the sounds of a live violinist can be processed and incorporated into the soundstage. The BEAST diffusion console has developed significantly over the years. The earliest systems depended on those commercially available mixing desks which had direct outputs from each fader. The stereo input signal from, for example, a tape-machine was split passively into the input channels on the desk, alternating left and right. The direct output from each channel fed the amplifiers for the loudspeakers, thus giving the individual control of each loudspeaker required for diffusion. The main disadvantage of this system was that it offered very little flexibility, making it difficult to move between sources in different formats (for example, quadraphonic, octaphonic or pieces with live input). In some situations complicated rewiring would be required for each source format used, which could be prone to errors particularly during the stress of a performance. The first custom built console BEAST developed was still based on a commercially available mixing desk, but which had been extensively modified, adding a matrix input section and balanced outputs. The matrix input section allowed a number of inputs to be assigned to any fader input using a series of push buttons. Where multiple sources were used during a concert, this allowed each work to have their assignment preset on the matrix. BEAST's positive and negative experiences with this experimental desk led them to design a new one: their last analogue desk, called the 3D. This was a fully custom built console with an extensive matrix input which was very easy and flexible to use. With the electroacoustic community's renewed interest in multichannel formats, and in particular octaphonic set-ups, came the need for BEAST to address how such pieces should be diffused. The diffusion of multichannel formats was too complex a task for the standard BEAST console, even the 3D, and BEAST turned to software solutions to solve these problems: first MAX/MSP and most recently, a system created in SuperCollider by Scott Wilson and Sergio Luque. Now, rather than using an analogue desk, a digital multichannel sound interface is used, and controlled via specially written applications using MIDI faders. This offers the maximum flexibility, with one fader, for example, being able to control only one loudspeaker, a stereo pair or an octaphonic circle depending on how the system has been configured. Using this system, multiple octaphonic groups, placed in different positions around the audience, can be used to diffuse octaphonic source material in a manner similar to that used for stereo. In this case, each fader controls one octaphonic group. A new set of three fully digital desks, using the Open Sound Control protocol, were made for BEAST by Sukhandar Kartadinata based on his GLUI platform. Clones of these desks have been adopted by other users and systems. Performances Since its debut in December 1982, BEAST has performed hundreds of concerts in the UK and Europe, both on its own and in joint performances with musicians from all over the world. BEAST has appeared at many notable festivals and concerts, including the Edinburgh International Festival, the Inventionen Festival in Berlin, Hello Digital, Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Multimediale 2 in Karlsruhe, in the Purcell Room and the Royal Festival Hall, The Royal Conservatoire in The Hague, the Adrian Boult Hall in Birmingham and the Henry Wood Hall in Glasgow. It was acclaimed when used as the concert sound system at the 1990 International Computer Music Conference held in Glasgow, and at the Aspekte Festival in Salzburg.

The genus Weta, erected by Chopard in 1923, is now considered a synonym of Pleioplectron. Seven additional species of Pleioplectron were named in 2019. All but one Pleioplectron species live in the South Island. The North Island species, Pleioplectron hudsoni, is widespread in forests, and females lay eggs into the soil or soft wood. In the South Island, P. simplex is sometimes found in woodpiles around houses and in cool basements between Christchurch and Invercargill.

The leaves are some of the largest in the family, up to long and broad, nearly heart-shaped, with a somewhat wavy, crenate margin. The flowers are small, produced on short, dense panicles up to long in late summer or early autumn; it is gynodioecious, with male and female (male sterile) flowers on separate plants. The species is closely related to the Japanese knotweed, Reynoutria japonica, and can be distinguished from it by its larger size, and in its leaves having a heart-shaped (not straight) base and a crenate margin.

Cultivation and uses Edible shoots The shoots are tender and edible. It was introduced to Europe and grown in many botanic gardens. It came prominently into notice about 1893, when a drought in western Europe caused a decided shortage in forage for cattle. This plant was little affected, and since its tender shoots and leaves were eaten by stock, the plant was widely grown experimentally as a forage crop. It has proved less useful than was predicted, and its deliberate cultivation has been almost entirely abandoned.New International Encyclopedia. Yale University Press, 1926. It has, however, like F. japonica, proved to be an invasive weed in several areas. It has hybridised with Reynoutria japonica in cultivation; the hybrid, Reynoutria √ó bohemica (Chrtek & Chrtkov√°) J.P.Bailey, is frequently found in the British Isles and elsewhere.Japanese Knotweed Alliance: Fallopia hybrids Extracts of this plant can be used as plant protectants for certain fungal and bacterial diseases.

It consists of two units, with all four tracks powered. It can carry up to 17 people, although the trailer unit can be adapted for different applications (see Variants section). There are two main versions, the NA-140 BT and the NA-110. The Nasu was tested in 1985, and the next year 11 pre-production units were ordered. Since then, more than five hundred have been manufactured to equip the armies of India, Turkey and Finland. Although it looks externally like the Bandvagn 206, which also is in Finnish Army use, it is an entirely new design, and almost 1 meter longer and heavier. It has better payload-carrying capability than the Bv 206. The Nasu is designed to carry troops and equipment through snow and bog-lands in northern Finland. For this, it is equipped with four wide (62 cm) powered rubber tracks. The low ground pressure enables the Nasu to cope with a wide range of difficult conditions. It is also fully amphibious, with a speed in water of up to when driven by its tracks. The total load capacity is and a trailer with a weight of up to can also be towed behind the second compartment. More than 500 vehicles of this type have been manufactured and it is used as a personnel carrier and a weapons platform (for BGM-71 TOW anti-tank guided missiles, 120 mm mortars).

Its distance modulus has been estimated using the globular cluster luminosity function to be 31.01 ¬± 0.21 which is about 52 Mly. It is the brightest dwarf irregular member of the Fornax cluster and is in the foreground of the cluster's central galaxy NGC 1399.  Characteristics and fate  The Irregular Galaxy NGC 1427A. Credit ESO NGC 1427A is over 20,000 light-years long and similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The resulting pressure is giving the galaxy its arrowhead outline and triggering the beautiful but violent episodes of star formation. Under the influence of galactic tides, NGC 1427A is travelling into the center of the Fornax cluster with a velocity of approximately 600 km per second. Its distinctive arrowhead shape has been formed by this rapid, upwards movement. The interaction of NGC 1427A with Fornax gasses and galaxies during its journey will cause the disruption of the galaxy within the next billion years, an event which was common during the evolution of the Universe but has become increasingly rare.  Image  The Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to obtain images of NGC 1427A in visible (green), red, and infrared filters in January 2003. These images were then combined by the Hubble Heritage team to create the color image shown in box. Astronomers are using the data to investigate the star-formation patterns throughout the object, to verify a prediction that there should be a relation between the ages of stars and their positions within the galaxy. This will help them understand how the gravitational influence of the cluster has affected the internal workings of this galaxy, and how this galaxy has responded to passing through the cluster environment. This image was image of the day on March 4, 2005.https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050304.html  Background spiral galaxy  To the upper left of NGC 1427A is a background galaxy that happens to lie near Hubble's line of sight but is some 25 times further away, about 1.3 billion light-years away. In contrast to the irregularly shaped NGC 1427A, the background galaxy is a magnificent spiral, somewhat similar to our own Milky Way. Stars are forming in its symmetric pinwheel-shaped spiral arms, which can be traced into the galaxy's bright nucleus. This galaxy is, however, less dominated by very young stars than NGC 1427A, giving it an overall yellower color.

It is funded by donations from the Christadelphian community. History and services The League was formed in 1928 in the UK. For the first eight years of its existence it dealt only with baptised members from the UK, after which the overseas section was set up. As of 2007 it helps believers in over 100 countries with regional distributors around the globe. There are over 2000 exhortations sent out weekly as well as Bible study guides. Sometimes CIL material is translated into various languages. Since 1959 a newsletter has been produced, the most recent of which ran to 36 pages and contain lessons, poems and current event news. A Sunday School section of the league was started in 1930 (with its own newsletter Chatterbox), a Braille section in 1939 and a service for deaf believers in 2003. There are over 1,500 audio tapes in their library which are available, some of which are being transferred to compact disc to be made more accessible. Occasionally there are events organised specifically for Christadelphians in isolation to meet each other and also members who are not in isolation.

She is The Economics of Technology Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Prior to joining Stanford, she was a professor at Harvard University. She is the first female winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. She currently serves as a long-term consultant to Microsoft as well as a consulting researcher to Microsoft Research. She also serves as the senior fellow at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.  Early life and education  Athey was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Rockville, Maryland. Her parents are Elizabeth Johansen, an English Teacher and freelance-editor, Whit Athey, graduate student in physics. Athey attended Duke University from the age of 16 in 1991. As an undergraduate at Duke, she completed three majors, in economics, mathematics, and computer science. She got her start in economics research during a summer job preparing bids for a company that was selling personal computers to the government through procurement auctions, working on problems related to auctions with Bob Marshall, a professor at Duke University who worked on defense procurement and helped her with procurement auctions. She was involved in a number of activities at Duke and served as treasurer of Chi Omega sorority and as president of the field hockey club. Athey graduated with a Ph.D. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business at the age of 24 in 1995. Her thesis was supervised by Paul Milgrom and Donald John Roberts. Athey, too, received an honorary doctorate from Duke University. Athey is married to economist Guido Imbens. They have three children. Career= Academic career  Athey's first position was as an assistant, associate professor and Castle Krob Career Development Chair at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for six years before returning to Stanford's Department of Economics as professor holding the Holbrook Working Chair for another five years. She then served as professor of economics at Harvard University until 2012, when she returned to Stanford Graduate School of Business, her alma mater. Applied auction research Auctions were the reason Athey went into economics. She has contributed on all dimensions to research on auctions. Athey's theoretical work on collusion in repeated games applies to auctions. As well as her existence theorem for sets with private information, she has done an innovative job on the econometrics of auctions. She has performed significant empirical work in econometrics of auctions. She also designed work that has had significant effects on business and public policy. Athey and Jonathan Levin examined the U.S. Forest Service's, oral ascending auctions for the rights to cut timber in the national forests. Typically, a given tract contains several different species of timber-yielding trees. The Forest Service publishes an estimate of the proportions of the various species based on an inspection. Potential bidders then can conduct their inspections. Bids are multidimensional: amounts to be paid per unit for each species. The winner is determined by aggregating each bidder's offer using the Forest Service's estimated proportions. The actual amount the winner pays, however, is computed by applying the bid vector to the exact amounts that are ultimately harvested (the winner has two years to complete the harvest). These rules create an incentive for a bidder whose estimate of the proportions differs from that of the Forest Service to skew its bidding, raising the price bid for the species that the bidder believes are less common than does the Forest Service. Conversely lowering the price bid for the species that the bidder believes are more common than does the Forest Service. For example, suppose there are two species and the Forest Service estimates that they are in equal proportions, but a bidder believes they are in dimensions 3:2. Then bids of ($100, $100) and ($50, $150) yield the same amount under the Forest Service proportions and so are equally likely to win, but the bidder's expected payments under the first and under the second differ).Roberts, John. ‚ÄúSusan C. Athey: John Bates Clark Award Winner 2007.‚Äù The Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 22, no. 4, 2008, pp. 181‚Äì198. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27648283. One of Athey's best-known works that deals with auctions is called ‚ÄúComparing Open and Sealed Bid Auctions: Theory and Evidence from Timber Auctions.\\" In this paper, Athey works with Johnathan Levin and Enrique Seira. She and her peers were interested in testing to see if the participation effects on auction were important.‚Äù There are two types of auctions, open and sealed-bid auctions. Open auctions are where bidders are constantly outbidding one another until the last bidder gives up and the auction ends, and sealed-bid auctions are when individuals write down their bids and submit them, whomever has the highest bid wins. The data that they used came from the United States Forest Service auctions. As a conclusion, they found that participation matters. It even matters more than what is actually taking place during the auctioning process.  Research contributions  Athey's early contributions included a new way to model uncertainty (the subject of her doctoral dissertation) and understand investor behavior given uncertainty, along with insights into the behavior of auctions. Athey's research on decision-making under uncertainty focused on conditions under which optimal decision policies would be monotone in a given parameter. She applied her results to establish conditions under which Nash equilibria would exist in auctions and other Bayesian games. Athey's work changed the way auctions are held. In the early 1990s Athey uncovered the weaknesses of an overly lenient dispute mechanism through experiences selling computers to the U.S. government at auctions, discovering that open auctions which resulted in frequent legal disputes followed by settlements were actually rife with collusion, e.g., auction winners shared a portion of their spoils with losers who had cooperated in bidding. She also aided British Columbia in the design of the pricing system used for publicly owned timber. She also published articles about auctions for online advertising and advised Microsoft about the design of their search advertising auctions.  Professional service  Athey has served as an associate editor of several leading journals, including the American Economic Review, Review of Economic Studies, and the RAND Journal of Economics, as well as the National Science Foundation economics panel, and she also served as an associate editor for Econometrica, Theoretical Economics, and the Quarterly Journal of Economics. She is a past co-editor of the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy and American Economic Journal: Microeconomics. She was the chair of the program committee for the 2006 North American Winter Meetings, and has served on numerous committees for the Econometric Society, the American Economic Association, and the Committee for the Status of Women in the Economics Profession.

History Memphis was launched on the 1st of March 1897 by the KAISERLICH K√ñNIGLICHE TABAK-REGIE. There has always been confusion about the date of establishment of the brand. From the 1980s until 2003 you can find various documents from Austria Tabak where they declare the introduction year of Memphis with 1897, but in 2005 they launched a new line called Memphis 1896 - and from there on they print \\"Since 1896\\" on the Memphis packs. Austria Tabak can trace its roots back to 1784, the year that the tobacco monopoly \\"Osterreichische Tabakregie\\" was formed. The name symbolized the origin of the tobaccos used from Egypt. Since 1989, the brand has been the market leader in Austria. However, Altria's Marlboro became the most popular brand in Austria, beating Memphis and Austria Tabak with a market share of 35.5 percent versus 34.5 percent. In 2000, about one third of all the smoked cigarettes in Austria was one of the Memphis variety. In 2010, Austria Tabak with Memphis only had a share of 14.2 percent. In 2011, the Austria Tabak factory in Hainburg an der Donau closed its doors as the production was moved in a foreign country. The reason for this, is because the number of smokers had declined over the years and smuggling, production costs and ancillary wage costs had increased. Various advertising posters were made to promote Memphis cigarettes throughout the 20th, as well as the 21st century.

Historically, the field of ethics has relied heavily on rational-linguistic approaches, largely ignoring the importance of seeing and visual representation to human moral behavior. At the same time, studies in visual culture tend to analyze imagistic representations while ignoring many of the ethical dimensions involved. Visual ethics is a field of cross-fertilization of ethics and visual culture studies that seeks to understand how the production and reception of visual images is always ethical, whether or not we are consciously aware of this fact.  Ethics of visual production  On the one hand, visual ethics is concerned with ethical issues involved in the production of visual images. For example, how do representations in newsmedia deploy cultural codes of race, class, ethnicity, gender, and so on in order to create distance from or empathy with specific people and groups? How can visual representations of the other facilitate or foreclose certain ethical responses from viewers? When is it ethically justifiable to capture and share images of another person in a moment of vulnerability? With whom should such images be shared?  Ethics of visual reception  Visual ethics is equally concerned with the ethics of reception, that is, with seeing as an ethical act. How do different images influence our ethical responses and moral behavior in different ways? To what extent do our ethical responses to images take place pre-reflectively, by visual-perceptual processes in the body-mind, before images even come to consciousness? It can be looked upon more into the cultural perception. It always depends on the cultural background. Ethics and visual arts This topic focuses on ethical theories and methods of ethical reasoning. Controversies and arguments abound as ethical decisions, or the lack thereof, continue to play a role in institutional practice. With the increasing gap between commerce and culture, the prioritization of good business over public service creates an increasingly blurry set of ethical guidelines. Collector- based exhibitions, conflicts of interest, and the de-accessioning practices of collections. One might ask do museums have a responsibility to their public? And if so, is this a part of institutional culture and is it being taught in today‚Äôs museum studies programs? Elaine A. King and co-editor Gail Levin addressed many of these issues in the anthology they compiled titled \\"Ethics and The Visual Arts\\" published in September 2006 by Allworth Press in New York. This volume of 19 essays explores a diverse range of topics about ethics in the visual arts. The dark side of the arts is explored in this volume with nineteen diverse essays by such distinguished authors as Eric Fischl, Suzaan Boettger, Stephen Weil, Richard Serra, and more cover a broad range of topics facing today‚Äôs artists, policy makers, art lawyers, galleries, museum professionals, and more.  Visual Ethics Symposium  In April 2007, under the direction of Timothy Beal of the Baker-Nord Center for the Humanities and William E.

He spent seventeen years playing for Gillingham, for whom he holds the record for the most matches played in all competitions. Career Born in Brinsworth, Hillyard was a schoolboy inside forward before being put in goal as a punishment. He joined Rotherham United as an amateur until the training nights were discontinued. He then played for Brinsworth Athletic in the Sheffield Amateur League before being recommended to Leeds United where he spent a season as fourth-choice keeper before being recommended to York City by Bobby Sibbald. Joining as a junior, Hillyard was thrust into the first-team in October 1969, when the club was facing a goalkeeping crisis. Loan spells at Hartlepool United, Bury and Brighton & Hove Albion followed where on his first meeting with Brian Clough was told to get his hair cut. Although he made 61 Football League appearances for York City over the next five years, he was unable to establish himself as a first-team regular. Finally in 1974, Gillingham manager Len Ashurst, who had been attempting to sign the Yorkshireman for his former club Hartlepool United for three years, was able to secure his transfer to his new club. For almost the entirety of the next seventeen years, Hillyard was the Kent club's first-choice goalkeeper, until a back injury forced him to retire in 1991. Two years earlier he had been appointed assistant manager by Damien Richardson, a post he continued to hold until 1992 when both he and Richardson were sacked. On 15 May 1983, Hillyard enjoyed a testimonial game when Gillingham beat West Ham United 3‚Äì2 at Priestfield Stadium.WHU Programmes Hillyard was expected to break John Simpson's record for the most league appearances for Gillingham but ultimately his career ended 8 matches short of Simpson's tally of 571. Nonetheless, Hillyard set a new record for appearances for the club in all competitions with a total of 657, during which he kept 202 clean sheets.

The history monoid provides a set of synchronization primitives (such as locks, mutexes or thread joins) for providing rendezvous points between a set of independently executing processes or threads. History monoids occur in the theory of concurrent computation, and provide a low-level mathematical foundation for process calculi, such as CSP the language of communicating sequential processes, or CCS, the calculus of communicating systems. History monoids were first presented by M.W. Shields.M.W. Shields \\"Concurrent Machines\\", Computer Journal, (1985) 28 pp. 449‚Äì465. History monoids are isomorphic to trace monoids (free partially commutative monoids) and to the monoid of dependency graphs. As such, they are free objects and are universal. The history monoid is a type of semi-abelian categorical product in the category of monoids. Product monoids and projection Let :A=(\\\\Sigma_1,\\\\Sigma_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\Sigma_n) denote an n-tuple of (not necessarily pairwise disjoint) alphabets \\\\Sigma_k. Let P(A) denote all possible combinations of finite-length strings from the alphabets: :P(A)=\\\\Sigma_1^* \\\\times \\\\Sigma_2^* \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times \\\\Sigma_n^* (In more formal language, P(A) is the Cartesian product of the free monoids of the \\\\Sigma_k. The superscript star is the Kleene star.) Composition in the product monoid is component-wise, so that, for :\\\\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2,\\\\ldots,u_n) \\\\, and :\\\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2,\\\\ldots,v_n) \\\\, then :\\\\mathbf{uv}=(u_1v_1,u_2v_2,\\\\ldots,u_nv_n) \\\\, for all \\\\mathbf{u}, \\\\mathbf{v} in P(A). Define the union alphabet to be :\\\\Sigma=\\\\Sigma_1 \\\\cup \\\\Sigma_2 \\\\cup \\\\cdots \\\\cup \\\\Sigma_n. \\\\, (The union here is the set union, not the disjoint union.) Given any string w\\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, we can pick out just the letters in some \\\\Sigma_k^* using the corresponding string projection \\\\pi_k:\\\\Sigma^*\\\\to\\\\Sigma_k^*. A distribution \\\\pi:\\\\Sigma^*\\\\to P(A) is the mapping that operates on w\\\\in \\\\Sigma^* with all of the \\\\pi_k, separating it into components in each free monoid: :\\\\pi(w)\\\\mapsto (\\\\pi_1(w), \\\\pi_2(w), \\\\ldots , \\\\pi_n(w)). \\\\, Histories For every a\\\\in\\\\Sigma, the tuple \\\\pi(a) is called the elementary history of a. It serves as an indicator function for the inclusion of a letter a in an alphabet \\\\Sigma_k. That is, :\\\\pi(a)=(a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n) where :a_k=\\\\begin{cases} a \\\\mbox{ if } a\\\\in \\\\Sigma_k \\\\ \\\\varepsilon \\\\mbox { otherwise }. \\\\end{cases} Here, \\\\varepsilon denotes the empty string. The history monoid H(A) is the submonoid of the product monoid P(A) generated by the elementary histories: H(A) = { \\\\pi(a)  a\\\\in\\\\Sigma }^* (where the superscript star is the Kleene star applied with a component-wise definition of composition as given above). The elements of H(A) are called global histories, and the projections of a global history are called individual histories. Connection to computer science The use of the word history in this context, and the connection to concurrent computing, can be understood as follows. An individual history is a record of the sequence of states of a process (or thread or machine); the alphabet \\\\Sigma_k is the set of states of the process. A letter that occurs in two or more alphabets serves as a synchronization primitive between the various individual histories. That is, if such a letter occurs in one individual history, it must also occur in another history, and serves to \\"tie\\" or \\"rendezvous\\" them together. Consider, for example, \\\\Sigma_1={a,b,c} and \\\\Sigma_2={a,d,e}. The union alphabet is of course \\\\Sigma={a,b,c,d,e}. The elementary histories are (a,a), (b,\\\\varepsilon), (c,\\\\varepsilon), (\\\\varepsilon,d) and (\\\\varepsilon,e). In this example, an individual history of the first process might be bcbcc while the individual history of the second machine might be ddded. Both of these individual histories are represented by the global history bcbdddcced, since the projection of this string onto the individual alphabets yields the individual histories. In the global history, the letters b and c can be considered to commute with the letters d and e, in that these can be rearranged without changing the individual histories. Such commutation is simply a statement that the first and second processes are running concurrently, and are unordered with respect to each other; they have not (yet) exchanged any messages or performed any synchronization. The letter a serves as a synchronization primitive, as its occurrence marks a spot in both the global and individual histories, that cannot be commuted across. Thus, while the letters b and c can be re-ordered past d and e, they cannot be reordered past a. Thus, the global history bcdabe and the global history bdcaeb both have as individual histories bcab and dae, indicating that the execution of d may happen before or after c. However, the letter a is synchronizing, so that e is guaranteed to happen after c, even though e is in a different process than c. Properties A history monoid is isomorphic to a trace monoid, and as such, is a type of semi-abelian categorical product in the category of monoids. In particular, the history monoid H(\\\\Sigma_1,\\\\Sigma_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\Sigma_n) is isomorphic to the trace monoid \\\\mathbb{M}(D) with the dependency relation given by :D=\\\\left(\\\\Sigma_1\\\\times\\\\Sigma_1\\\\right)\\\\cup \\\\left(\\\\Sigma_2\\\\times\\\\Sigma_2\\\\right)\\\\cup \\\\cdots \\\\cup \\\\left(\\\\Sigma_n\\\\times\\\\Sigma_n\\\\right). In simple terms, this is just the formal statement of the informal discussion given above: the letters in an alphabet \\\\Sigma_k can be commutatively re-ordered past the letters in an alphabet \\\\Sigma_j, unless they are letters that occur in both alphabets. Thus, traces are exactly global histories, and vice versa. Conversely, given any trace monoid \\\\mathbb{M}(D), one can construct an isomorphic history monoid by taking a sequence of alphabets \\\\Sigma_{a, b} = {a, b} where (a, b) ranges over all pairs in D.

The operation was led by Lt. General Ali Sayad Shirazi, and was conducted in four phases. Some believe that this operation was the turning point in the warIran Chamber Society: History of Iran: Iran-Iraq War 1980-1988 and that it led to the eviction of Iraqi troops from Khuzestan. Others (including Efraim Karsh) believe it was actually the operation working in tandem with others which led to the expulsion of Iraqi troops from southern Iran. He believes that in fact, Operation Beit ol- Moqaddas, which lasted from April to May 1982, had the greatest effect, because the Iranians were able to liberate the strategically important city of Khorramshahr. Prelude On 22 September 1980, Saddam Hussein, attempting to copy the success of the Israeli pre-emptive air strike against the Arab air forces in the Six-Day War, launched numerous sorties against Iranian air fields, hoping to destroy the Iranian air force on the ground. Although they failed, Saddam was still not going to be prevented from achieving his aim of establishing complete Iraqi dominance over the Shatt al-Arab, called Arvand Rood in Iran (Persian: ÿßÿ±ŸàŸÜÿØ ÿ±ŸàÿØ) waterway. He launched a land invasion of Iran, focusing on southern Iran. He was able to achieve success, capturing the major Iranian city of Khorramshahr. Although the Iraqis were not able to capture the city of Abadan, the way was open to Tehran as the Iranian defenses had collapsed. The Iraqi advance was halted at the Karun and Karkheh rivers respectively and now Iran was able to counter-attack; although their first counter-attack was a failure, this one would be successful. The battle On 22 March 1982, precisely 18 months to the day of the Iraqi invasion, the Iranians launched Operation Fath ol-Mobin. They intended to use a pincer movement to encircle Iraqi forces who had halted outside the Iranian town of Shush. Under the command of the young Iranian Chief-of-Staff, Lieutenant General Ali Sayad Shirazi, the Iranians launched an armored thrust on the night of the 22nd followed by constant human-wave attacks by Pasdaran and Basij brigades, each composed of about 1,000 fighters. The Iranians suffered much greater casualties than the Iraqis, because the Iranian attack at times involved massive unsupported frontal assaults made by the Pasdaran and Basij. The Iranian forces still had to contend with an Iraqi army which was entrenched on the front-line and they enjoyed a good amount of tank, artillery, and aerial support. The Iranians kept up the momentum against the Iraqi forces and, after heavy Iraqi losses, Saddam ordered a retreat on the 28th. Three Iraqi divisions were encircled in the operation and destroyed within a week. Aftermath Along with Operation Tariq al-Qods and Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, the Iranians were able to evict the Iraqi forces from southern Iran. The wider operation to re-capture Khuzestan is rightly to be considered a turning point. The Iranians had succeeded in achieving their standing aim of reversing the gains made by the Iraqi armed forces in the initial stages of the Iran-Iraq War. Afterward, the Iranian hardliners, headed by the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, argued for the expansion of Iranian war operations into Iraq. They eventually succeeded in getting their way, and the Iranians commenced several operations to conquer territory. But where the Iranians successfully used combined-arms operations to emerge victorious against the Iraqi troops in Iran, they relied upon unsupported human wave attacks by the poorly trained troops of the Pasdaran and the Basij. The Iraqis eventually stabilized their armed forces after their retreat from Iran. The result was that the Iranians would not be able to press their determined, but futile, assaults against a resurgent Iraqi army.

He was born in Kambuzuma (a high density suburb in Harare), Harare the capital of Zimbabwe. Winky D was among the artists featured in the Southern Africa Music Airwaves (SAMA) Festival 2009.  Early Life  Winky D liked music at an early stage and he started listening Reggae music at the age of 8. He could spend some time searching and collecting audio tapes and records so that he could listen Reggae music. Winky D has a brother named Trevor Chirumiko who is famously known as Layan. Layan (Winky D's brother) is also a music producer, singer and a presenter. Wallace Chirumiko attended his primary and secondary school in Harare. Winky D learnt at Rukudzo Primary School and later on Kambuzuma high school. When he was a teenager, Winky D started performing on small functions and concerts. When he was 16, he performed at Getto Lane Clashes, which was DJ Battles for identifying the best talented one and Winky was identified. By doing so Winky D started to get known. After some time he was nicknamed 'Wicked DeeJay' which was shortened as Winky D. He was given that nickname because his music message which was powerful. His lyrics were explicit, rave about violent and immoralities. However from 2013, he started singing Gospel and also encouraging youths to stop drugs Music career With the help of Bartholomew Vera of Blacklab studios, Winky D went into the recording studio. His first songs, like \\"Rasta\\" and \\"Dead Inna War\\", coupled with his ingenious stage performances, set the dance floors very busy. He has since released eleven albums with many chart hits which have gained him fans across the world, evidenced by successful tours in United Kingdom, USA, Asia and South Africa. Winky D has become the new icon for Zimbabwean and African urban/reggae music with nicknames like \\"King of Dancehall\\",\\"Gombwe\\" \\"Gafa(Gaffer\\", Extraterrestrial \\"The BigMan\\", \\"Messi wereggae\\", and \\"Truthsayer\\" being attached to him in the ghettos. In a bid to persuade the Zimbabwean male population to get circumcised, Population Services International and the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare initiated a Winky D and Albert Nyoni (Vanyoni Beats) entitled \\"If you know you are a champion get circumcised\\". The song was launched in Harare on 19 January 2012. In December 2010, Winky D, alongside Guspy Warrior and Terry Fabulous from Chimurenga drive in Zengeza, were scheduled to perform with Capleton on New Year's Eve . However, after failure to reach common ground, the \\"Musarova bigman\\" star withdrew and cancelled all his scheduled performance from Capleton's Zimbabwean tour. Winky D failed to perform at President Robert Mugabe's inauguration gala held in August 2013 at the National Sports Stadium, following contrasting statements about the musician's whereabouts during the event. In 2011, Winky D made his debut at the Monash Beer fest Carnival in Johannesburg, South Africa performing alongside Black Coffee, Cabo Snoop, Dj Betto, Dj Leks, TshepNOZ and Sipho, Dj Luo, and Kay Mack. Feuds Winky D had 'beefs' with then popular dancehall artists such as Madcom and Dadza D. They battled back and forth lyrically, from which he emerged as a victor en route to become the most popular zim-dancehall act. Winky D, alongside The General and Sniper Storm, were scheduled to perform as opening acts for Mavado. Winky D performed first and kept Mavado and Sniper Storm waiting backstage. Efforts were made by the organizing people of the show to get the \\"Bigman\\" off stage and make way for a ten-minute Sniper Storm performance, but to no avail. Sniper Storm then took matters into his own hands and snatched the mic from Winky D. Sniper's actions caused a rage as the crowd threw things onto the stage. This also caused heated debates all over the internet and street corners across Zimbabwe, as various musicians and entertainers reacted. Winky D has seen more artist throw shots at him to gain popularity from him, which he has since ignored. The most popular of these is Seh Calaz, who has had considerable and noteworthy attention for his disses towards the ninja president, to which he has also not replied but only called for peace among the zim-dancehall artists through his songs (Mafeelings, tiki taka, sungura like and PaGhetto which he mentions Seh Calaz) and interviews. Gombwe album launch and birthday bash Having been over the years launching his album through low key events. The line up on the day included Buffalo Souljah, Killer T, Jah Signal, Vabati VaJehova and others. However, it was Winky D who took limelight and dished his extraterrestrial-gombwe magic on the fans who sang along and danced throughout the early hours of the morning. Another highlight, was Socialite and Businessman Genius Kadungure bid the first copy of the Album for $20,000 but he was forced to revise the initial amount after flamboyant Albert Ndabambi ‚Äòoutshined‚Äô him by bidding the CD for $30,000. Ginimbi, as he is affectionately known in the world of socialites, dug deeper into his pockets forking another $20,000 to make it $40,000. In total Team Winky D walked away with $70,000 for his initial copy of \\"Gombwe: Chiextra. Oskid produced 13 out of the 14 tracks on the album with the exception of My Woman (feat. Beenie Man) which was produced by Nicky. All in all the Launch made history as the most attended Launch and most expensive Album in the country. The album itself, the performance on the night and launch proved Winky D is the best artist in Zimbabwe.

It earns its name from the black-striped tail and sides, which are reminiscent of the insignia of a military Sergeant, being similar to those of the sergeant major damselfish. It grows to a length of about . Scissortail sergeants live on coral reefs at depths of up to in tropical reaches, often living in a group surrounding a single head of coral. They are found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea. The fish feed upon the larvae of invertebrates, zooplankton, smaller fishes, crustaceans, and various species of algae. They are preyed upon by some members of the Labridae and Serranidae families. They lay their eggs in patches on a firm substrate and guard them vigorously till they hatch. Distribution and habitat Scissortail sergeants are found in the Indo- Pacific including the Red Sea. Areas scissortail sergeants can be found in around the Indian Ocean include the Red Sea, eastern Africa, Madagascar, Seychelles, the Persian Gulf, India, Sri Lanka, the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman Sea, Indonesia, and Australia. Pacific Ocean populations are found in the Great Barrier Reef around Australia, the Gulf of Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and various Pacific islands all the way to Hawaii. Adults live in coral reefs while younger individuals live in the open sea. They are found at depths of . Description This fish is white.Mark McGrouther. \\"Scissortail Sergeant, Abudefduf sexfasciatus (Lacep√®de, 1801)\\" Australian Museum Australia November 23, 2012, Retrieved on December 21, 2014 They have 5 vertical bands that are black. Two horizontal bands are also sometimes present on the lobes of their tail. This fish can grow up to at maximum length. Ecology=Diet This species fish feeds on algae, zooplankton, and sometimes its own eggs. Behavior This fish aggregates in large groups above coral. In the aquarium This fish is popular in the aquarium trade. Reproduction=Parental care Like some other fish species, male scissortail sergeants are in charge of parental care. Males are polygamous and will collect eggs from up to 12 females while females spawn with a male and then abandon their eggs. Male parental care is more common than female or biparental care in fish because territorial males are able to guard several clutches of eggs while simultaneously attracting new mates. Male scissortail sergeants undergo brood cycling, in which they alternate between a mating phase and a parental phase. During the mating phase, males become gold in color and put on displays to attract egg-laying females. After two to three days in the mating phase, male scissortail sergeants will lose their gold color and transition into a four- to five-day parental phase. During the parental phase, males guard their eggs until they hatch. Filial cannibalism occurs during the parental phase. Female choice In order to select the best quality males and maximize their offspring survival rate, females will pool their eggs with other females into a single male's territory and create a larger brood. Studies have shown that pooling to create larger broods serves to not only decrease predatory effects, but also increases paternal investment. By increasing brood size, predation rate per individual decreases as a result of dilution effects. Also, males with larger broods are less likely to cannibalize their broods. It has also been hypothesized that egg pooling is a simple imitation tactic by which females confirm the quality of the male. By copying the spawning behavior of other females, females can minimize the search costs of finding a good mate. In order to increase the propagation of their offspring, female scissortail sergeant must also actively select for good fathers. Female fish utilize multiple strategies in order to select for male parental quality: important factors include mate size, courtship rates, and male cannibalism. Some females will monitor a male's parental quality by laying small clutches of ‚Äútest eggs‚Äù in a male's territory. This unusual tactic is a direct way for females to confirm the parenting ability of males who do not yet have any eggs in their brood. Females only lay one test clutch and return shortly after laying it. Capable males prove their parental quality by defending the brood and not cannibalizing the eggs. Test eggs are energetically expensive to create, so this strategy is typically only used by large females at the beginning of the mating phase. Filial cannibalism Filial cannibalism, the act of eating one's own offspring, is a common phenomena in territorial male fish. It occurs during the parental phase of brood cycling. Embryo mortality rates are generally attributed more to filial cannibalism than to predation effects because embryo predators are largely unsuccessful. Recent studies suggest that filial cannibalism, in fact, is an evolutionarily adaptive behavior. Baseline cannibalism is a result of males eating nonviable or damaged eggs, but males may cannibalize their current broods even more based on the costs and benefits of their parental investment. Raising offspring requires a large energy investment. Increased filial cannibalism occurs when the cost-to-benefit ratio of raising offspring is too high. Filial cannibalism balances the loss of foraging opportunities. When guarding their territories, investment costs are lowest for large males with easy food access. When fathers are small and are unable to forage while caring for their broods, their offspring can be used as an extra food source to offset the energy requirements needed for parental care. By eating part of his brood, a male can improve his care for the remaining young in his brood. Supplementary feeding, however, decreases the energetic costs of raising a brood and can modulate cannibalistic tendencies in male scissortail sergeants. Experiments that supply provisional food like scissortail sergeant eggs and/or crab meat to brooding males lead to a decrease in cannibalism. At the most extreme level, a male Scissortail Sergeant may cannibalize his entire brood. If the current brood is small and is not worth a male's continued investment, a male can choose to improve his future reproductive success by eating the rest of his current brood. Studies show that males who skip one mating cycle due to cannibalism or other environmental factors tend to invest more effort and have larger broods during the following season. Cannibalism is also related to brood size and age. There is an increase in cannibalism when broods have low reproductive value. Smaller broods that are still early in the development cycle have relatively low reproductive value and are more likely to be cannibalized. Studies found that males who had their clutches reduced the first day of the parental phase were more likely to cannibalize the remaining eggs. Males whose broods are reduced on the third day of the parental phase, however, do not increase cannibalism because parental care is less costly closer to the hatch date. Males that cannibalized their broods early on in the development process, however, may mate with more females and rebrood during the same season. Filial cannibalism is also influenced by the father's relatedness to his brood. The benefits of parental investment decrease with decreasing relatedness. Sneaking by other males is a common occurrence in male scissortail sergeants. Sneaking behavior, as defined by opportunistic males that attempt to fertilize some eggs during another spawning pair, decreases the relatedness of a brood to its father. Decreased benefits due to relatedness increase the probability of cannibalism. When there are many other non-nesting males around a male's territory, scientists see increased cannibalism and reduced parental care. This finding is attributed to the increased probability of sneaking.

This weaver is very widespread and found in a wide range of habitats, including shrubland, savanna, grassland, open woodland, inland wetlands and semi-desert areas. It also occurs in suburban gardens and parks. Description The southern masked weaver is long with a short, strong, conical bill and pinkish brown legs. The adult male in breeding plumage has a black face, throat and beak, red eye, bright yellow head and underparts, and a plain yellowish-green back, The female has a pinkish-brown bill, brown or red-brown eye and is dull greenish- yellow, streaked darker on the upper back. The throat is yellowish, fading to off-white on the belly. The non-breeding male resembles the female but retains the red eye. The juvenile of this species is like the female. The call is a harsh swizzling, similar to other weavers. It also utters a sharp chuk alarm note. Behaviour and ecology Etosha, Namibia) Nest Building and Breeding The southern masked weaver nests in colonies, mainly from September to January. Males have several female partners, and build a succession of nests, typically 25 each season. The nests, like those of other weavers, are woven from reed, palm or grass. A female will line a selected nest with soft grass and feathers. The nest is built in a tree, often over water, but sometimes in suburbia. This weaver also nests in reeds. The southern masked weaver lays eggs of a various colour and this helps it to evade parasitisation by cuckoos because the cuckoo has no way of knowing what kind of eggs are inside the weaver's nest until it has entered the nest to attempt to lay one itself. Eggs of the wrong colouration are ejected by the nest owners.PARASITISM OF THE MASKED WEAVER PLOCEUS VELATUS ARUNDINACEUSH C.

She starred in the hit series Dr. G: Medical Examiner on the Discovery Health Channel which first aired in July 2004 and ran until 2012. Repeats of the show are aired on the Discovery Life Channel and Justice Network.http://www.justicenetworktv.com/shows/dr-g-medical-examiner The show is ranked No. 1 for Discovery Health and is also broadcast in Australia, Europe, South America and South Africa. Garavaglia has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, The Rachael Ray Show, The Doctors and The Dr. Oz Show. Early life and education Garavaglia was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Charles and Jennie Garavaglia. Her father worked as a butcher, and her mother worked briefly as a secretary and shoe model. Garavaglia has two brothers. She attended Concord Elementary School and Lindbergh High School, graduating in 1974. Garavaglia received her medical degree from the St. Louis University School of Medicine and completed an internship in internal medicine and residency in anatomic/clinical pathology at St. Louis University Hospitals. She also completed a fellowship in forensic pathology at the Dade County Medical Examiner's Office in Miami. She is board-certified in combined anatomic and clinical pathology and forensic pathology. Family Garavaglia married her first husband in 1980. In 1988, she got her first job as an Associate Medical Examiner in Duval County, Jacksonville, Florida and gave birth to their first son. Garavaglia and her family moved to Georgia in 1991 where she took a job as Associate Medical Examiner for the next two years. In 1993, the family moved once again to San Antonio, Texas where Garavaglia spent the next ten years as a Medical Examiner in the Bexar County Forensic Science Center. Their second son was born during this time, in 1994. Garavaglia and her first husband later divorced in 2006, and in 2007 she married her second husband, Dr. Mark Wallace, whom she had met years earlier while attending medical school. Dr. Wallace has made several appearances on Dr. G: Medical Examiner as an expert in infectious disease and internal medicine. The couple reside in Mount Vernon, WA. Career One of the first cases Garavaglia worked on as a medical examiner was the Morning Glory Funeral Home scandal, in which thirty-seven bodies ‚Äì many in advanced stages of decomposition ‚Äì were found in a funeral home. After several caskets that the funeral director had buried were exhumed, Garavaglia determined that the director had placed multiple persons in single caskets, and pocketed the money he received. Garavaglia, as an associate medical examiner in Bexar County, Texas, examined the body of Tracie McBride,\\"Life Interrupted\\" (2007), Dr. G: Medical Examiner, about 15:25-15:30 of 44:34. and then autopsied her at the Bexar County Forensic Science Center in San Antonio, Texas; the case was covered on Dr. G.\\"Life Interrupted\\" (2007), Dr. G: Medical Examiner, about 6:45-6:55 of 44:34.

On December 11, 2008, the remains of a small child, confirmed to be those of missing Caylee Anthony, were found near the Anthony residence in Orlando. As the location fell within Garavaglia's jurisdiction, it became Garavaglia who was the one who examined the remains and made the determination. In 2008, Garavaglia authored How Not to Die, in which she relates some of her own experiences as a medical examiner to educate readers how to better care for their health and avoid premature death. On May 18, 2012, Garavaglia delivered the keynote address at the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Science Olympiad National Tournament held at the University of Central Florida. On May 15, 2015, after over two decades in the practice of forensic pathology, Garavaglia announced her retirement from the District 9 medical examiner's office, to be effective on May 28, 2015. She had previously stated that she intended to retire after their youngest son left to attend college in 2013, but ended up staying on as the chief medical examiner for District 9 for two more years. She told the local news reporter interviewing her that after her retirement she would be moving to her husband's hometown, 90 minutes north of Seattle, Washington.

The bridge in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood spans the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Big Creek (a Cuyahoga River tributary that runs through the Cleveland Metroparks' Brookside Reservation), John Nagy Boulevard, and Norfolk Southern and CSX railroad tracks. One of the original bridge's arch supports The original Fulton Road Bridge The original bridge, constructed in 1932 and dedicated in mid-May of that year, was initially six lanes. Two lanes were later removed, making it into a four-lane bridge. Several years prior to demolition, two more lanes were closed to traffic, but not taken down. The bridge was then two lanes, with two more blocked off, and with a sidewalk on each side. In 1997, three metal canopies were installed under the roadway to prevent debris from falling from the deteriorating bridge onto zoo patrons. The bridge was closed on October 5, 2006, and demolished in 2007. The new bridge, which includes arch- or Y-styled supports and appears similar to the original, opened on July 9, 2010. Demolition Tires protecting the water main Before the demolition occurred, the bridge had gone through some deconstruction, mainly of the deck. This was required due to the discovery, in November 2006, of tiles used as waterproofing under the deck which contained asbestos. These tiles had to be removed by a subcontractor before demolition could proceed. Also prior to the implosion, a major 42‚Äù water transmission main, crossing twice underneath the old bridge, was covered by over 1,200 old tires, designed to absorb the shock of the falling bridge deck and protect the main. The final implosion was scheduled to occur on Saturday April 28, 2007 at 8:00 AM, but a detonation cable failure resulted in only about one-quarter of the bridge being knocked down. On Tuesday, May 1, just after 6 PM, the remainder of the bridge was demolished, leaving only the arch supports at either end. Construction of the new Fulton Road Bridge The replacement bridge nearing completion (note similarity in design to original bridge). The replacement bridge overlooks the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo and spans a historic footbridge, two railroad tracks, a major water main, and several maintenance roads and footpaths - as did the original. It has four traffic lanes, two bicycle lanes, and sidewalks. The building contractor for the new bridge, Kokosing Construction Company, estimated the cost of replacing the bridge at $45,859,138.00. The new structure is an eleven-span, pre-cast, open-spandrel arch bridge. According to the contractor, nearly \\"1,800 cubic yards of self-leveling mass concrete are contained in the bridge piers. These seven piers were post-tensioned to support the pre-cast arches, which were erected in segments on shoring towers and then post-tensioned as well. Following the erection of the arches, the spandrel columns and caps were poured. Pre-cast concrete beams were also erected to support the bridge deck.\\"Contractor's webpage There were several delays during the replacement project, some due to weather conditions. The original opening estimate for mid-2009 was pushed back several times, eventually as far as July, 2010, when the new bridge was finally opened for traffic. Cleveland city Councilman Kevin Kelley called the delays \\"incredibly frustrating\\", noting they were \\"beyond reasonable and not fair to merchants\\" many of whom had gone out of business due to rerouted traffic.

The first phase of air strikes were undertaken by the Iraqi Air Force, which normally was followed by retaliation by Iranian Armed Forces. Iraq attacked major cities in the western half of Iran, including Tehran, Tabriz, Isfahan and Shiraz, in addition to attacks to Iranian towns and cities close to the front. Iran's retaliations targeted mostly Baghdad, Kirkuk and Basra. Raids While Iraq had launched numerous attacks with aircraft and missiles against border cities from the beginning of the war and sporadic raids on Iran's main cities, this was the first systematic strategic bombing that Iraq carried out during the war. This would become known as the \\"War of the Cities\\". With the help of the US and the West, Iraq's air force had been rebuilt and expanded. Meanwhile, Iran, due to sanctions and lack of spare parts, had heavily curtailed its air force operations. Iraq used Tu-22 Blinder and Tu-16 Badger strategic bombers to carry out long-range high-speed raids on Iranian cities, including Tehran. Fighter-bombers such as the MiG-25 Foxbat and Su-22 Fitter were used against smaller or shorter range targets, as well as escorting the strategic bombers. Civilian and industrial targets were hit by the raids, and each successful raid inflicted economic damage from regular strategic bombing. In response, the Iranians deployed F-4 Phantoms to combat the Iraqis, and eventually they deployed F-14s as well. By 1986, Iran also expanded its air defense network to take the load of the fighting off the air force. Later in the war, Iraqi raids primarily consisted of missile attacks while air attacks were used on fewer, more important targets. Starting in 1987, Saddam also ordered several chemical attacks on civilian targets in Iran, such as the town of Sardasht. Iran also launched several retaliatory air raids on Iraq, while primarily shelling border cities such as Basra. Iran also bought some Scud missiles from Libya and launched them against Baghdad. These too inflicted damage upon Iraq. On 7 February 1984 (during the First War of the Cities), Saddam ordered his air force to attack eleven Iranian cities; bombardments ceased on 22 February 1984. Though Saddam had aimed for the attacks to demoralise Iran and force them to negotiate, they had little effect. Iraq's air force took heavy losses, and Iran struck back, hitting Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. Nevertheless, the attacks resulted in tens of thousands of civilian casualties on both sides, and became known as the first \\"war of the cities\\". It was estimated that 4,700 Iranian civilians were killed and 22,000 were wounded during the raids in February alone. There were five such major exchanges throughout the course of the war, and multiple minor ones. While interior cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Qom, Isfahan and Shiraz did receive numerous raids, it was the cities of western Iran that suffered the most death and destruction. Series Five series of systematic air raids were conducted over eight years. The first series, initiated by the Iraqi Army, lasted from February 7 to 22, 1984, and was conducted in response to the Iranian refusal to observe a ceasefire. The second series was conducted from March 22 to April 8, 1985 and was in response to Iranian Operation Badr. This series involved attacking many Iranian urban areas in western Iran, including Tehran, Tabriz, Shiraz, and Isfahan. The third series was lasted from January 17 to 25, 1987, and was conducted in response to Iranian Operation Dawn 8. The fourth series was conducted for three consecutive months from February to April 1987. The fifth series was the most intensive, and was conducted by Iraq once the Iranian front lines showed elements of weakening. It was conducted in January-February 1988, and involved missile attacks to some Iranian cities.Perrimond, Guy (2002). \\"1944‚Äì2001: The threat of theatre ballistic missiles\\" TTU Online. Aftermath The conflict caused initiation of Iran's missile program by IRGC. In popular culture The war era has become the theme of many films, with some of them representing the situation of cities in the wartime. For example, ' (1992) portrays the general image of Tehran as a quiet city that turned to a location of a rocket war and sometimes this calmness and quietness breaks with the sound of ambulances and fire-fighting alarms. Under the Shadow (2016) is another film, which portrays Tehran during the war of the cities.

Life and work Born in the town of Georgia, Vermont, Daniel was one of seven children in his household. His parents were Loomis and Susanna Bliss. His mother died when Daniel was only nine years old. Bliss spent much of his youth in the state of Ohio. He began to support himself at the age of sixteen mainly by farming, tanning, and tree grafting. He graduated from Kingsville Academy in 1848 and went on to attend Amherst College. Once he graduated from Amherst in 1852, Bliss went on to attend Andover Theological Seminary to prepare for foreign and overseas missions. By October 1855, he was ordained at Amherst and in November of the same year he was married to Abby Maria Wood. After being assigned to Syria by the American Board, he and his wife sailed from Boston, Massachusetts, on December 1855. By April 1856, they arrived at their destination in Aley, Lebanon. Bliss and his wife worked there for roughly one and a half years in a small school which had opened in 1843. Under his direction, the school rose into prominence in the area. From October 1858 until 1862, Bliss was in charge of a boarding school in a town just north of Aley called Souk-al-Gharb. He also studied Arabic during this time. His success there led the Syrian mission to open a new college in Lebanon. Bliss got the project chartered in 1864 by the New York State and raised funds in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Once he had accumulated enough money, he founded the Syrian Protestant College. The school, which opened in Beirut in 1866, later came to be known as the American University of Beirut (AUB). Bliss was named President of the college he had founded and also took on the responsibilities of treasurer and Professor of Bible and Ethics. Having been one of its prime movers, he returned to the United States, arriving in New York in September 1862. He met with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions where he spoke in support of the resolutions adopted in Beirut. The Hon. William E. Dodge, impressed by Bliss's presentation, helped him form a Board of Trustees. A certificate of incorporation was drafted on April 18, 1863, and on April 24, 1863 a charter for establishing a college was granted by the legislature of the State of New York. A building in the AUB and a well-known street in Beirut were named after him. He resigned in 1902 and was succeeded by his son, Howard Bliss. Daniel Bliss died on campus on July 27, 1916. He published several tracts, and is the author of a ‚ÄúMental Philosophy‚Äù and ‚ÄúNatural Philosophy‚Äù in Arabic.

The building which now houses the centre's reception and main social areas was built in the 1850s as a private residence and named Swanwick Hayes. Since 1910, however, it has taken up its current usage, apart from the Second World War years when it was a POW camp for German and Italian prisoners. It was the second camp to fail to hold the famous German escapee Franz von Werra. The escape tunnel can still be seen at the conference centre. The centre is one of the larger employers in the area, with some employees having been with the company for over 30 years. The company has a policy of using local suppliers wherever possible, especially for fresh food, and generally to be eco-friendly. It has a large photo voltaic installation on its roof, and electric vehicle charging points. The centre, which has had many additions to it since it opened, provides sleeping accommodation for up to 400 people in 274 rooms (11 of which have enhanced accessibility for people with special needs). Nearly all bedrooms have en-suite facilities, with most being doubles although there are also a number of family rooms. A few rooms have shared washing and toilet facilities, but these tend to be used only when the centre is full. There are two main dining rooms, although working lunches can also be provided in any of the meeting rooms. There are more than 30 rooms for meetings: the largest two hold 420 and 400 with two others holding 150 and 140, and there are many others for smaller groups or for break-out sessions. Modern audio visual equipment is provided as appropriate in all meeting rooms. Other facilities include a bar, small gift shop, five a side football pitches, a sports hall, a fitness room, a games room and a chapel with room for 350. The site has a high speed fibre connection to the internet, offering up to 1Gb by arrangement, and there is complete wi-fi coverage across all the buildings. Many of the clients using this estate are Christian groups and churches of all denominations, but clients include commercial organisations, local authorities, schools, charities and public bodies. The centre has been run by same organisation since 1910, with commercial bookings handled by First Conference Estate and for Christian groups by the Christian Conference Trust. In addition, the centre is home to the Swanwick writers' summer school. As well as providing locations the trust can help organise conferences at The Hayes, and its sister sites at High Leigh in Hoddesdon or Belsey Bridge near Bungay.

She was born in Lakewood, Colorado. Life Taylor-Corbett grew up in the Denver, Colorado area, gaining her first exposure to dance through her mother, a pianist for ballet classes. She left Colorado for New York City at the age of 17, where she initially found work as an usher at the New York State Theater (renamed the David H. Koch Theater in 2011), home of the New York City Ballet, shortly before joining the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, where later in her choreographic career as part of the company's Women's Choreography Initiative, she would create her ballet Prayers from the Edge, inspired by her experiences and observations while touring with the Ailey company, particularly of performing in the Middle East and Africa following the Six-Day Arab-Israeli War in 1967. She also danced and choreographed for a small ensemble, The Dance Theatre Collection, where her work garnered enough attention to draw increasingly prestigious commissions through the 1970s and into the 1980s, including from Mikhail Baryshnikov during his tenure as artistic director at American Ballet Theatre. She works in theatre and film (most notably, creating the choreography for the 1984 dance classic Footloose.), and also choreographs for dance companies, both ballet and modern, and is the principal guest choreographer for Carolina Ballet. She choreographed the dance Great Galloping Gottschalk (set to music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk) for the American Ballet Theatre, which premiered the work in Miami in January 1982.Note on \\"Great Galloping Gottschalk\\" balletmet.org, accessed May 21, 2009 Taylor-Corbett was nominated for the 2000 Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical and Best Choreography for the musical Swing! and also received a 2000 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Choreography. Her recent stage work includes both directing and choreographing the musical My Vaudeville Man!, which ran off-Broadway at the York Theatre Company from November 2008 through January 2009.Gans, Andrew.\\"My Vaudeville Man! Opens Off- Broadway Run Nov. 17\\", playbill.com, November 17, 2008 She received a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Choreography with her collaborator, Shonn Wiley, for My Vaudeville Man!. Lynne Taylor Corbett has created some of her most inspiring choreography on Carolina Ballet. She has worked with the company extensively for 10 years and has developed deep knowledge of the strengths of the Carolina Ballet dancers. Lynn has also familiarized herself with the North Carolina Triangle region. In North Carolina, Lynne is most recognized for her lively crowd pleaser \\"Carolina Jamboree\\" featuring music by the Red Clay Ramblers, (a North Carolinian blue grass band). During the live performances of Carolina Jamboree, The Red Clay Ramblers are integrated with the professional dancers. Lynne wanted local music to be soul of her work in Carolina Jamboree and this is clearly presented by having the live band elevated on stage with the dancers. The intermissions of the piece are even choreographed balletically and musically. The Red Clay Ramblers play interludes with active audience and dancer participation. Carolina Ballet received rave reviews for its revival of Carolina Jamboree in 2013, both at the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium and at the Durham Performing Arts Center (DPAC). The ballet choreography in Carolina Jamboree evokes lively folk dancing shown through several solos, pas de deuxs, and group dances. The \\"Red Rocking Chair\\" female solo is deeply moving in its depiction of a mother who has lost her newborn. Lynne's Taylor Corbett's work in Carolina Jamboree carries a strong sense of nationalism towards American dance. The ballet is split into three acts. The first: \\"Appalachia Stories,\\" the second: \\"The Mystery of Nell Cropsey,\\" and the third: \\"Fiddlesticks.\\" All three sections touch on the hardships of the Great Depression and the joys of overcoming such hard times. Carolina Jamboree is a true testament to Lynne's Taylor-Corbett's talent. The piece showcases dancers abilities both technically and emotionally and it is a joy to view as an audience member. https://web.archive.org/web/20140225023602/http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2836399/review- fancy-free-and-carolina.html The Stage Directors and Choreographers Society announced that Taylor-Corbett is the recipient of the 2008 Joseph A.

He had released Domingo the year before in collaboration with Gal Costa. It was one of the first Tropic√°lia efforts, and features arrangements by J√∫lio Medaglia, Damiano Cozzella, and Sandino Hohagen, as well as an eclectic assortment of influences, demonstrating the \\"antropofagia\\" (artistic cannibalism) of the Tropic√°lia movement. Sounds from psychedelia, rock, pop, Indian music, bossa nova, Bahian music and other genres appear on the album. It includes the hit songs \\"Alegria, Alegria\\", \\"Tropic√°lia\\", and \\"Soy loco por ti, Am√©rica\\".  Background  Recorded to capitalize on the success of the forward-looking \\"Alegria, Alegria\\" at the TV Record Festival, the album mostly continued in the new direction in which Caetano and his fellow tropicalistas (though that term had not yet been employed to describe them) wanted to take Brazilian popular music. Where his debut Domingo had been primarily based on more traditional Brazilian musical styles such as bossa nova, his second album relied heavily on sounds and instrumentation more common to rock and roll and psychedelia.  Notable songs =\\"Tropic√°lia\\" The album's opener gets its title from the H√©lio Oiticica installation of the same name; Caetano's appropriation of the title was the basis for his initial association with the term, which later lent its name to the art movement of which he was a central figure, Tropicalismo. The song's lyrics do not mention the title or refer to it directly. In fact, Caetano had already completed the song's composition when film producer Luiz Carlos Barreto suggested \\"Tropic√°lia\\" as its title, seeing similarities between its content and that of the art exhibit. Caetano, who had never heard of Oiticica or his work up to that point, resolved to use the title until he found a better one, which he never did. The Noel Rosa song \\"Coisas nossas\\", with its listing of various elements of Brazilian society, inspired the lyrics to \\"Tropic√°lia\\", which similarly list cultural icons, such as the Portuguese- born but Brazilian-raised international superstar Carmen Miranda, a line from the popular Roberto Carlos song \\"Quero que tudo v√° pro inferno\\", and the Louis Malle film Viva Maria. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone as the 21st greatest Brazilian song.  \\"Alegria, Alegria\\"= Reception  Caetano has expressed displeasure with the album, calling it \\"amateurish and confused\\", but it is widely regarded as a classic,[ Allmusic review] often showing up on lists of greatest Brazilian albums.Sounds and Colors (7 November 2010). \\"The Best Tropicalia Albums\\" It was very popular upon its release in Brazil, and the Brazilian press used the song title \\"Tropic√°lia\\" to christen the larger artistic movement it represented \\"Tropicalismo\\", to the disdain of Caetano himself.

He was the first African American elected to a state public office in Northern California. Family background Rumford was born in Courtland, Arizona, a now-defunct mining town, the second of Chauncey G. Rumford and Margaret Lee Johnson's two sons. His father, who had left the family when Rumford was very young, lived in Los Angeles, where his family had moved in about 1910 from Iowa by way of Colorado Springs. Rumford's mother's side were some of the first American settlers of Arizona. His maternal grandmother ran a boarding house in Tombstone and fought to keep the Tucson public schools desegregated. When Whites established separate schools, she relocated to Los Angeles, having decided that \\"she was not going to bring those kids up in a segregated environment.\\" Rumford remained with his mother in Tucson, where she worked as a housekeeper. His older brother Chauncey moved to Los Angeles to live with his father and paternal grandmother, and Rumford and his mother soon moved to Phoenix, where she married a barber, Elmer J. Williams. They joined the rest of the family in Los Angeles in 1915, living for a time in a large house on Burlington Avenue. There, his paternal grandmother's sister, who was a songwriter, poet, and painter, helped Delilah L. Beasley write her 1916 history The Negro Trail Blazers of California. His stepfather, however, did not take to Los Angeles well, and returned the family to Phoenix. His mother and stepfather had children of their own, and Williams paid little attention to the Rumford brothers, who had to work to survive. Education Rumford graduated from Carver High School, a segregated high school in Phoenix in 1926. He was inspired to attend the University of California, Berkeley, by his high school teachers, particularly Ellis Knox, a Berkeley alumnus who later became the first African American to receive a doctorate on the West Coast. At the age of 18, he moved to San Francisco and worked for a year before enrolling in Sacramento Junior College. He was accepted to the school of pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco, and worked as a parking valet and a doorman at night. He graduated in 1931. Rumford was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha (ŒëŒ¶Œë) fraternity. Career In 1933, Rumford passed the examination for employment with the State of California at a time when few blacks worked for the state. He also took the examination for investigator on the California Board of Pharmacy, passing the written portion twice, but failing the oral portion two times. \\"I think I frightened everybody to death on the board when I was there for my oral examination. [...] I took the examination for food and drug investigator and I flunked the oral after they asked me about Joe Louis. And later I came back, took it again, and I flunked it again.\\" According to Rumford, the board was \\"asking silly questions [...] to get rid of blacks.\\" He then took the examination for state VD investigator and passed, but failed the state examination a third time. He visited the member of the personnel board that lived in Oakland. Christenson, the board member, appealed the board's decision to fail Rumford on the grounds that he was asked irrelevant questions. Rumford appealed on the grounds that the board had publicized the statistic that African Americans suffered from sexually transmitted diseases at a greater rate than other ethnic groups, but had not taken the opportunity to do something about it. He won the appeal and was granted state certification. He became the first African American hired at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, where he was assistant pharmacist. There he worked under Dr. Benjamin Black, a former army doctor, \\"outstanding authorit[y] in hospital administration\\", and \\"a very prejudiced person.\\" Black was hesitant to hire Rumford, suspecting him of wanting to \\"make trouble\\", and was reluctant to raise his salary. But with the help of influential friends, including Thomas E. Caldecott and county Supervisor Harry Bartell, he received a raise at the beginning of World War II. However, he left the job due to the low pay, and was appointed VD investigator. For about a year, he worked primarily at army bases, such as Camp Knight, where his main responsibility was apprehending carriers of STDs. When not on base, he worked in city clinics. In 1942, while still working for the state, he purchased a pharmacy in Berkeley. He tried to work both jobs, but eventually devoted his energies to the business. Public service In 1942, Berkeley Mayor Laurance L. Cross appointed Rumford to the Emergency Housing Committee, which sought to find housing for wartime laborers. In his capacity as committee member, he was able to push for more integrated housing. He helped organize the Berkeley Interracial Committee, a citizen's committee whose purpose was to \\"placate and to welcome some of the people and to ameliorate some of the problems that did arise as a result of the influx\\" of Southerners. The Berkeley Interracial Committee welcomed the Southerners to the community and helped them when they ran into problems. It worked with the Committee on Fair Play to fight the Japanese American internment, and helped the City establish a Human Relations Commission. In 1944, Governor Earl Warren appointed Rumford to the Rent Control Board, a state agency that was part of a federal wartime program to keep wages and rents down. Political career In 1948, he made his first attempt for a seat in the Assembly. He had been involved with the Appomattox Club, \\"perhaps one of the first\\" African American political organizations in the Bay Area, since 1932, when it supported the policies of the Roosevelt administration. In the primary, he was supported by the club, as well as by a community caucus, and a group of African American ministers. The CIO withheld support, seeing Rumford as not radical enough. He won the primary, but lost the election to Edgar Hurley, who had filed as both a Republican and a Democrat. Rumford took the case to court, which found that his numbers were much higher than expected in certain areas, and ruled that Rumford had been the rightful winner of the election. Major issues in the campaign were the desegregation of the National Guard and ending discrimination in the hiring of teachers. He began his term as representative of the 17th assembly district in January 1949, joining Gus Hawkins of Los Angeles, who was one of the few legislators who pushed legislation that would benefit African Americans. Rumford was a Prince Hall freemason, but the masons were not involved in the desegregation movement. In his first year in the state assembly, Rumford succeeded in passing legislation barring discrimination in the state National Guard. When it reached the state senate, its chances of passing were slim. But Rumford personally lobbied senators Richard J. Dolwig and Earl Desmond, and the bill passed the senate as well. In reality, it was not implemented because the members of already- existing black units did not want to lose their titles and ranks. However, no new black units were created, and the Guard was eventually integrated. In 1953, Rumford invited Governor Earl Warren to address the national convention of Alpha Phi Alpha, held in Berkeley. Despite illness and torrential rain, Warren was glad to make the speech and meet those convened. While Rumford was in the legislature, his Berkeley pharmacy \\"became an informal headquarters for other emerging politicians, such as future mayor Lionel Wilson and California Supreme Court Justice Allen Broussard.\\" Legislative career One of Rumford's most important achievements was the passage of the California Fair Employment Practices Act, which outlawed employment discrimination. The bill had originally been introduced by Hawkins in 1945, but it never got out of committee. C. L. Dellums and other members of the NAACP lobbied in favor of the bill. It passed the assembly in 1955 with the support of Democrats, some of whom were personally opposed to it but succumbed to pressure from within the party, and even a few Republicans, \\"because they thought it was basically and morally right.\\" It was signed by incoming Governor Pat Brown in 1959, and the Fair Employment Practices Commission was set up the same year. Rumford served on the assembly's Civil Service Commission, which addressed issues of discrimination in government employment, including the California Highway Patrol and the State Department of Public Health. He also attempted to secure raises for members of the California State Employees Association. In 1953, he became chairman of the Public Health Committee. He was part of a delegation that went to Detroit to discuss the issue of air pollution with the automotive industry and their researchers. They convinced the industry to send technicians to testify before a joint committee of the California legislature. He was also sent to Germany as a Citizen-Ambassador for the State Department to investigate forms of public transportation. The Public Health Committee passed the first air pollution control act in 1955. It also passed some of the first radiation control acts in the country. Rumford also served on the \\"Little Hoover Commission\\", which made recommendations for the reorganization of state government. In the 1950s, he was appointed chairman of the Records Management Program for the Weinberger Committee on Government Reorganization. The Committee investigated corruption in the State Board of Equalization, which was illegally selling liquor licenses, and sent several of its members to San Quentin State Prison. The Weinberger Committee also successfully passed the Water Resources Act of 1956, which set up the State Water Board. In 1959, Rumford investigated the health effects of DDT, and discovered pesticides in milk supplies. In 1963, Rumford introduced Assembly Bill 1240, the Fair Housing Bill. It became known as the Rumford Fair Housing Bill, and its purpose was to outlaw discrimination in housing. The bill was at the top of Governor Brown's legislative agenda, and it had been endorsed by the NAACP and the California Democratic Party. Nonetheless, it faced strong opposition and was amended several times before being passed by a vote of 47 to 24. When it reached the state senate, members of the Congress of Racial Equality occupied the rotunda of the California State Capitol. Rumford asked them to leave, but they refused. The bill was held up for three months, and the committee didn't hold a hearing on it until the last day of the session. Despite the opposition of the California Real Estate Association, the Apartment House Owners Association, and the Chamber of Commerce, the bill passed the senate and was signed into law by Governor Brown. Rather than seeking to amend the law, the opposition to the Rumford Fair Housing Act sought to amend the California Constitution to permit housing discrimination with California Proposition 14. Though it passed, it was later declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Senate run In 1966, Rumford ran for a seat in the California State Senate. The seat had been created after a reapportionment to reflect the population growth in Alameda County. According to Rumford, \\"Mr. Holmdahl and those in the assembly who were doing the reapportioning saw fit not to divide Alameda County into two seats, but to have the two prospective senators running at-large--largely, I believe, because they were fearful that some black might be elected from a portion of the county.\\" John Holmdahl, the current senator, announced that he would not run to keep his seat, which eased the tension between Rumford and Nicholas Petris, the other contender. The two met and agreed that Petris would run for the two-year seat and Rumford the four-year. Petris's law partner, Edward Fitzsimmons, filed for candidacy, as did Superior Court Judge Victor Wagner and another candidate. The campaign in swing, Petris wrote an endorsement letter for Fitzsimmons, stating that Fitzsimmons would make a better senator. Nonetheless, Rumford soundly defeated all of his opponents in the primary. In the general election, he faced the poorly-funded Republican candidate, Lewis Sherman. It was the first time that electronic voting machines were used. A reporter informed him that numerous votes had not been counted. Rumford was told that there were 10,000 ballots that had not been counted because \\"they wouldn't go through the machine.\\" Since the results showed that he was only 600 votes behind, he requested a recount. Recounting, he noticed that a number of ballots were filled out with the same handwriting. Two deputies agreed, and Rumford halted the recount. U.S. Attorney Cecil Poole asked the FBI to look into the case. After a ten-day investigation, the FBI declared that the case had no merit. Rumford took the case to Alameda County district attorney Frank Coakley, who found large discrepancies between the registrar's records and those kept by the precincts. He requested that the handwriting expert from the State Identification Bureau examine the handwriting samples, but said they were not the same. Rumford and Coakley wanted a second opinion, so Coakley hired the San Francisco postmaster to examine the samples over Rumford's suggestion to have a UC professor of criminology do it. However, before the postmaster received the ballots, they were sent back to the expert from the State Identification Bureau, where they may have been changed. The postmaster came to the same conclusion as the other investigators. Door-to-door studies found that \\"there had been no purging of the county list for years and that thousands of sample ballots were lodged in the post offices, both in Oakland and Berkeley.\\" Rumford brought the issue to the attention of the Grand Jury, but the body took no action. In 1970, he was selected to serve on the Grand Jury, and volunteered for the Committee on Courts Enforcement, which looked into the electoral system in Alameda County. While the commission did not open the case of Rumford's senate run, it did make inquiries into the registration process and as to why so many people were ineligible to vote, as well as looking into the reasons for the quantities of ballots at the post office. Service in Washington In 1971, Caspar Weinberger, who was then Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, invited Rumford to Washington, D.C. to help him with the commission's work protecting consumers. He served for five years as Assistant Director for Consumer Protection and State-Federal Relations of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Return to Berkeley In 1976 Rumford returned to private life and his pharmacy, from which he retired in 1981. He developed Parkinson's disease and died in 1986. Honors Rumford was honored at the 1972 World Symposium on Air Pollution Control, which recognized his contributions to the fight against air pollution. In 1980, a segment of state highway 24, the Grove-Shafter Freeway, was renamed the William Byron Rumford Freeway in his honor. The postal station at the Oakland federal building is named for him, as is a senior housing community in Berkeley. His archives are housed in the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley. A bronze monument to Rumford by artist Dana King was dedicated near the location of his pharmacy on Sacramento Street at Julia Street in Berkeley in July 2016.

Rellstab was a very influential figure in Berlin's musical life. Career He performed in student concerts 1768 to 1775 at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium in Berlin. He studied with Johann Friedrich Agricola from 1773 to 1776, and composition with Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch. He planned to continue his education with Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach in Hamburg, when in 1779 he had to take over the printing business of his father. Given his interest in music, Rellstab changed the focus of the business towards music and added a music lending library (in 1783) and a music publishing branch to the firm (ca. 1785). Later on, Rellstab also made instruments and sold other music supplies. After losing his property in the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, he began teaching music lessons to children., from Nicolas Slonimsky, Laura Kuhn, Dennis McIntire, in Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians Rellstab's compositions include a Te Deum, a mass, numerous cantatas, lieder, and an unperformed singspiel, Die Apotheke, among other works. His son Ludwig Rellstab was also a music critic and a poet. Rellstab's eldest daughter, Caroline Rellstab (1793‚Äì1813), was a singer noted for her extraordinary range extending to F6. She sang at Breslau from 1811, and was particularly well known for her role as the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te.

It was discovered by English astronomer John Herschel on July 29, 1834. This is a nearby Seyfert (active) galaxy, located at a distance of approximately from the Milky Way. Since it appears to have detached spiral arm segments (either from dust lanes or bright star clusters), it was listed in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Walter Scott Houston describes its appearance in small telescopes: > Do not let its photographic magnitude of 11.6 scare you off, for it can be > seen in a 6-inch telescope as a curiously fuzzy object.

Centrosaurinae was named by paleontologist Lawrence Lambe in 1915, with Centrosaurus as the type genus. The centrosaurines are further divided into three tribes: the Nasutoceratopsini, the Centrosaurini, and the Pachyrhinosaurini by Ryan et al (2016). Nasutoceratopsins are defined as centrosaurines closer to Nasutoceratops titusi than to Centrosaurus apertus and centrosaurins are defined as centrosaurines (more specifically eucentrosaurans) closer to Centrosaurus apertus than to Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis. The only division used up until then was Pachyrhinosaurini which was defined as centrosaurines closer to Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis than to Centrosaurus apertus. Centrosaurine fossil remains are known primarily from the northern region of Laramidia (modern day Alberta, Montana, and Alaska) but isolated taxa have been found in China and Utah as well. Defining features of centrosaurines include a large nasal horn, short supratemporal horns, and an ornamented frill projecting from the back of the skull. With the exception of Centrosaurus apertus, all adult centrosaurines have spike-like ornaments midway up the skull. Morphometric analysis shows that centrosaurines differ from other ceratopsian groups in skull, snout, and frill shapes. There is evidence to suggest that male centrosaurines had an extended period of adolescence and sexual ornamention did not appear until adulthood.

undescribed and unnamed Nasutoceratopsini exhibited in the Museo del Mamuth in Chihuahua City, from the municipality of Aldama. Centrosaurine fossils have mostly been found in Western North America (Alberta, Montana, & Alaska). In the United States, two taxa, Diabloceratops and Machairoceratops, have been found as far south as Utah. Yehuecauhceratops is a nasutoceratopsin from Coahuila, Mexico and the southernmost occurrence of a centrosaurine in North America. No centrosaurine fossils had been uncovered outside Western North America until 2010 when Sinoceratops zhuchengensis was discovered in the Shandong Province of China. Some authors question the placement of Sinoceratops within Centrosaurinae, however. All other Late Cretaceous dinosaur groups from North America have been found in Asia as well so the initial absence of Asian centrosaurines had been surprising. The current evidence suggests that Centrosaurinae originated in Laramidia 90-80 million years ago. This means Sinoceratops would have migrated to China from North America. Some hypothesize that centrosaurines originated in the south Laramidia and only later radiated north. Body Size Compared to their sister group, Chasmosaurinae, centrosaurines are relatively small. The primitive Sinoceratops zhuchengensis is an exception, with an estimated skull length of 180 cm. By contrast, the skull length of Albertoceratops was more typical for this group at only 67 cm. In general, centrosaurines were about the size of a rhinoceros with body lengths ranging from 2.5 to 8 meters. Reproduction Hypothesised ontogenic development of Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum Possible neonate sized centrosaurine fossils have been documented in the scientific literature. Research indicates that centrosaurines did not achieve fully developed mating signals until nearly fully grown. Scott D. Sampson finds commonality between the slow growth of mating signals in centrosaurines and the extended adolescence of animals whose social structures are ranked hierarchies founded on age-related differences. In these sorts of groups young males are typically sexually mature for several years before actually beginning to breed, when their mating signals are most fully developed. Females, by contrast do not have such an extended adolescence. See also * Timeline of ceratopsian research FootnotesReferences * * Sampson, S.

Geography A chalk stream Goddard's Brook emerges in the village, feeding into Ginge Brook, which eventually joins the River Ock near Abingdon. In 1993 a mixed conifer and deciduous woodland was planted behind the village, the area is named Christopher's Wood after Christopher Loyd, previous manager of the Lockinge Estate. National Cycle Route 544 passes through the village. History The route of the ancient Icknield Way passes through the village. Arnhill and the nearby vicinity behind the village was an Iron Age fortification and Anglo-Saxon burial ground. Although a barrow was destroyed by ploughing, in approximately 1863 remains and artefacts were recovered from the summit of the hill. West Lockinge had a tithe barn for several centuries but no trace of it now survives. An open field system of farming also prevailed in West Lockinge parish until it was enclosed in 1808. One cottage in the village is half-timbered and bears the date 1666. West Lockinge Farm has a Georgian farmhouse of five bays. It is built of blue and red brick and has a hipped roof.

It was constructed from a section of the former Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midland Junction Railway, which was built by the Midland Railway in 1863 to link Manchester with London and closed in 1968. The Monsal Trail is about in length and opened in 1981. It starts at the Topley Pike junction in Wye Dale, east of Buxton, and runs to Coombs Viaduct, south-east of Bakewell. It follows the valley of the River Wye. The trail passes through Blackwell Mill, Chee Dale, Millers Dale, Cressbrook, Monsal Dale, Great Longstone, Hassop and Bakewell. The trail has numerous landmarks including Headstone Viaduct, Cressbrook Mill, Litton Mill and Hassop railway station, and passes through six tunnels. History The former railway line near Hassop Railway Station The Monsall Trail follows a section of the former Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, built by the Midland Railway in 1863 to link Manchester with London. The line was closed in 1968 by the Labour Minister for Transport Barbara Castle, not by the Beeching Axe, and remained unused for twelve years before being taken over by the Peak District National Park. The route through the Wye valley was necessitated by the Duke of Devonshire's objection to the railway passing through his land (which included not only Chatsworth House, but extensive grounds north of Rowsley). The route meant that the line had to pass above the town of Bakewell, rather than through it. The Duke of Rutland, of Haddon Hall, insisted on the construction of Haddon Tunnel to hide it from his view, but he used Bakewell railway station, which was built to a grander design than normal and carried his coat of arms. The Duke of Devonshire later realised the value of the railway, and his offer for the Midland Railway to run through Chatsworth came too late. He was the force behind the construction of Hassop railway station, which, although nearer to Bakewell than Hassop village, meant he did not have to share a railway station with his neighbour. Great Longstone station (Longstone before 1913) served Thornbridge Hall, and the railway station design, with leaded glass windows, reflected the architecture of the hall. For many years the trail could not follow the trackbed through the tunnels at Monsal Head and Cressbrook which been closed for safety reasons and the trail was diverted to avoid them. The tunnels were walked by Julia Bradbury in BBC TV's Railway Walks: The Peak Express. Many access points and diversion paths were unsuitable for cyclists, wheelchairs or people with walking difficulties because of steep uneven stone steps or narrow paths. Plans to make the tunnels safe and re-open them to the public were given the go-ahead at a cost of ¬£3.785 million. The tunnels were formally opened on 25 May 2011 at a ceremony at the Headstone Viaduct after being used from 13 May 2011. The trail can be used by wheelchair users with level access at Bakewell, Hassop railway station (disabled toilets at Bakewell and Millers Dale railway stations) and Millers Dale. Route description Headstone Viaduct viewed from Monsal Head The Monsal Trail is about in length and opened in 1981. It starts at the Topley Pike junction (in Wye Dale, east of Buxton) and runs to Coombs Viaduct, south-east of Bakewell. It follows the valley of the River Wye and runs parallel to the A6. From the Wyedale car park, the easiest access point for the northern end of the trail, there is a walk of about , with the last part up steps, to reach the trail. Starting at the south of the trail, \\"from Market Place in Bakewell, follow Sheffield Road and cross the five- arched bridge of the River Wye, turn right and ascend Station Road to the former Bakewell railway station and car park on your left.\\" The trail passes through Blackwell Mill, Millers Dale, Cressbrook, Monsal Dale, Great Longstone, Hassop and Bakewell. At Longstone and Hassop the railway stations were some distance from the villages. Derbyshire County Council support the creation of a circular cycle route linking Buxton, Bakewell and Matlock with the High Peak Trail. Dubbed the White Peak Loop, it includes extending the Monsal Trail to Matlock, a proposal which received strong support from a public consultation exercise in 2014. The section between Rowsley and Matlock opened in March 2018, running adjacent to the railway trackbed except for minor diversions just north of Rowsley South, at Darley Dale, and at Matlock. The remaining section of the route between Bakewell (Coombs Viaduct) and Rowsley is at the design stage. When complete, the section will run for the most part along the railway trackbed and require new bridges at Rowsley and the refurbishment and opening up of the 1-km Haddon Tunnel. Landmarks Cressbrook Tunnel, one of six on the trail A cutting made for the railway Walkers on the Monsal Trail Headstone Viaduct  Headstone Viaduct, at Monsal Head, is one of the more impressive structures on the line, although when built it was seen as destroying the beauty of the dale. John Ruskin, a poet and conservationist of the time, criticised the building of the railway: His words are displayed on the viaduct. When the railway closed and there was talk of demolishing the viaduct, there was considerable opposition. In 1970 it was designated as a Grade II listed building. Cressbrook Mill Cressbrook Mill opened as a cotton mill in 1783, powered by water from Cressbrook stream. It was built on the site of a distillery by William Newton of Abney. The original building was destroyed by fire. Litton Mill Litton Mill was a large cotton spinning mill that opened in 1782. It was notorious for the harsh treatment of child labourers by the owner, Ellis Needham. Many of the children, brought from London and other large cities, died young from the cruel treatment. Hassop railway station Hassop railway station was situated about two miles from the village. It was opened in 1862 by the Midland Railway on its extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway from Rowsley.  Tunnels  The trail passes through the following tunnels: * Headstone: * Cressbrook: through limestone, 1 in 100 gradient * Litton: through limestone, 1 in 100 gradient * Chee Tor 1: * Chee Tor 2: * Rusher Cutting Tunnel: Recreation The route is used for recreation purposes by cyclists, walkers, horse riders, wheelchair users and joggers. A 5km Parkrun, run entirely on the Monsal Trail, takes place every Saturday morning at 9am; it starts at Hassop Railway Station, passing Thornbridge Hall, continuing to Headstone tunnel and then turning around to finish where it began.

The village's population has increased steadily over the last decade with many new housing developments catering, in particular, for overspill population from Letterkenny. Kilmacrennan was historically the caput of its eponymous Barony of Kilmacrennan, of the eight Baronies of Donegal. The Battle of Kilmacrennan was fought near the village in 1608 during O'Doherty's Rebellion. Geography Kilmacrennan lies on the N56 10 km northwest of Letterkenny, which is the largest town in County Donegal. The village's name 'Cill Mhic n√âan√°in' means 'the church of the sons of √âan√°n'. Two rivers flow through the village, the Lennon and the Lurgy. Traditionally, the river Lennon was renowned for salmon fishing; however, the salmon numbers have dropped dramatically in recent years. Most anglers blame pollution for this. The salmon and trout population is slowly increasing but will take a number of years for it to reach its old level. Amenities A 1916 Remembrance Garden was opened to the public in 2016 to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising. There are three churches: a Catholic church and the Church of St Finian and St Mark Church of Ireland in the village itself, as well as a Presbyterian Church in the townland of Leiter about 3 km away.

It stars Edward Herrmann, Christine Taylor and Veronica Hamel. The film tells the story of the Munster family's arrival in America from Transylvania. Plot The Munster family is tired of being persecuted back in Transylvania, and on finding part of a letter from cousin Marilyn in California, decides to head to the United States. On arrival they find that Marilyn's father, Norman Hyde, is missing, and her mother (Herman's sister) Elsa Hyde is in a coma. Marilyn details this in the letter but Spot burned the mail (and the letter carrier) so this comes as a surprise to the Munsters. The family must find out what has happened to Marilyn's father, and find a way to revive Elsa. They also have to try to live in new surroundings as they try to \\"fit in\\" in America. It turns out that Norman was trying to find a way to make his \\"peaches and cream\\" daughter, Marilyn, look a little more like the rest of the clan, but somehow the experiment backfired and Norman Hyde became Brent Jekyll. This is a take on The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. Brent Jekyll is running for Congress and as part of his campaign is trying to get foreigners out of America (this includes the Munsters). There is a more sinister part of the story as it seems that Hyde was sabotaged and transformed into Jekyll purposely, to bring forward a politician without a past with whom people would listen. As the story unfolds, the family tries to save the day. With Herman arrested and placed in jail, Grandpa creates a replica of him from spare parts and uses it to help him escape. They flee from the scene in the Munster Koach.

The original Herman from the TV series, Fred Gwynne, had passed away two years before.  Production=Writing While the movie draws on many elements of the original series, it departs from the established \\"Munsters\\" canon. In this version Marilyn's last name is given as Hyde and she is the daughter of Herman's sister, not Lily's (as she is in the original series and in \\"The Munsters Today\\"). Also, in this film Marilyn is the same age as she is in the series, however Marilyn has said in the original series that Herman and Lily have raised her since she was a baby. In terms of the Munster's house, the ownership was changed. In the original series and \\"The Munsters Today\\", the Munsters owned the house but in this version they are just house-sitting for Herman's sister. Grandpa's lab is shown to be under the stairs (where \\"Spot\\" lived) instead of under a trap door in the living room as in the original series and in \\"The Munsters Today\\". Finally, in this version, Grandpa uses a spell to create The Munster Koach by transforming a hearse. This is in contradiction to the original series and \\"The Munsters Today\\" where Lily buys it as a gift for Herman.

During the reign of Pribina's son, prince Kocel (861-876), in the summer of 867, it provided short-term hospitality to brothers Cyril and Methodius on their way from Great Moravia to the pope in Rome to justify the use of the Slavonic language as a liturgical language. They and their disciples turned Blatnograd into one of the centers that spread the knowledge of the new Slavonic script (Glagolitic alphabet) and literature, educating numerous future missionaries in their native language.

The academy was launched on 1 July 2013, sponsored by the CWA Academy Trust founded by the College of West Anglia.Downham Market Academy website About Downham Market Academy, Retrieved on 6 September 2014. Teaching is shared between two sites, with the main Bexwell campus housing pupils years 7‚Äì11 (ages 11‚Äì16) and the Downham Market Academy Sixth Form (formerly Downham Market College) campus offering A-levels to sixth form pupils years 12‚Äì13 (ages 16‚Äì18).  History  The Bexwell site dates back to 1956 and was originally organised as separate boys' and girls' secondary modern single-sex schools. With building adaptations at the time of re-organisation in 1980, these former schools are now designated the Junior and Senior sides of the Bexwell site. The Upwell block was added as a consequence of the closure of Upwell Secondary in 1982 when around 220 additional pupils were added to the school roll. The Malcolm Arnold Room was opened by the composer Sir Malcolm Arnold in 1984. Other buildings on the Bexwell site include the Technology Block (1997), the Arts Block, housing History, Music and Drama (2001) and the English Block (2005). Ryston was formerly the premises of Downham Grammar School, built in 1930 in the extensive grounds of the White House dating back to the 17th century. The house was formerly occupied by the headmaster of the school and, later, by the sixth form. It became surplus to requirements and was sold back into the residential sector in 2000. Since reorganisation, two new blocks have been added on the Ryston site. The Art and Business centre was opened by Gillian Shepherd MP, Minister of State for Education. The academic years 1980/81 and 1981/82 saw the phasing out of the previous grammar and secondary modern pattern of education and, from September 1982, Downham Market High School became a fully amalgamated county, co-educational, secondary, comprehensive, day school. Year 7 pupils were based at Ryston after reorganisation in 1980, due to Bexwell insufficient space for five year groups, and Ryston's additional space for the then much smaller sixth form. Ofsted stressed the importance of uniting Key Stages 3 and 4 on the same site and this was duly achieved with the opening of the New Block on the Bexwell site in 2001. In September 1983, the existing transfer arrangements into the school were re- organised so that all pupils entered at 11+ and not, as hitherto, with pupils from the surrounding village primary schools entering at 11+ and pupils from Clackclose County Middle School and Hillcrest First and Middle School entering at 12+. The school gained Grant-Maintained status in 1992 (which lasted until the change of Government in 1997) and was extended with new buildings, sports hall and swimming pool. Technology College status was gained in 1996 by the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. The school became an academy in July 2013, sponsored by the College of West Anglia's CWA Academy Trust. In July 2015, the Academy became notable for a viral video produced for the departing Year 11 students, which featured many of the current staff members lip-syncing to Queen's \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\". The video quickly gained attention, reaching 14,000 views in two weeks. It was directed by current Media Studies teacher Ian Gooda and ex-students Sam Lance and Lois Nash. A sequel was released in July 2016, featuring Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding Out For A Hero\\". A third video was released in 2017, this time parodying the American television show Friends, and its theme tune \\"I'll Be There for You\\". It was again produced by Ian Gooda, Sam Lance, Lois Nash and Jamie Robinson. The videos continued to be produced annually until the final effort in 2019.  Drama and music  The drama department is active in the academy, offering a range of extracurricular activities and producing a variety of productions each year. Sixth Sense Theatre Company is part of the drama department in the academy and teaches senior pupils the art of touring a production. Every summer the company tours a production; in recent years they have performed in Scotland, the Channel Islands and Australia. The music department runs several orchestras and arranges instrument tuition for pupils. The department stages a number of concerts throughout the year including the annual Christmas and recital concerts.  Sports  The academy has a good reputation for sports, and teams regularly compete with other schools and in championships. Sports facilities on site include football and hockey pitches, tennis courts, basketball courts, cricket nets and a leisure centre (run by the Borough Council) which holds a sports hall, gym and swimming pool, which the school regularly use.

Between the mid-1990s and 2012 it was a faction within the United Arab List. Background The party was formed on 15 February 1988, towards the end of the term of the eleventh Knesset, when Abdulwahab Darawshe broke away from the Alignment to create his own faction in protest at the party's policy on the First Intifada. At the time of its founding, the party was the only solely Israeli Arab faction in the Knesset (although the Progressive List for Peace's only MK was an Israeli Arab, the party also had Jewish membership), and the first since the demise of the original United Arab List in the 1981 elections. In the 1988 elections the party just crossed the electoral threshold of 1%, winning 1.2% of the vote and one seat, taken by Darawshe, and was again the only Israeli-Arab party to win a seat. The 1992 elections saw the party win two seats, though it remained the only Israeli Arab party with parliamentary representation. For the 1996 elections, the party ran in an alliance with the new United Arab List under the name Mada-Ra'am (the acronyms of each party). The alliance was successful, winning two seats. The party was also joined in the Knesset by a new Israeli Arab party, Balad, which had run in an alliance with Hadash. After the 1996 elections, the party became a faction within the United Arab List, a position it retained until Taleb el-Sana broke away from the United Arab List in December 2012. The party contested the 2015 elections as part of the Arab List, an alliance with the Arab National Party headed by Muhamad Kanan. The alliance received just 4,301 votes (0.11%), failing to win a seat.

Johnson, p. 2; published 2004 One of the original owners of Geri's was a former Vice President for McDonald's. Geri's restaurants, at least in the early days, had little or no inside seating, and were geared towards fast take-out service.

There were at least 13 Geri's restaurants by 1980. Red, blue and white were the main exterior colors, often in the form of tiles. Later incarnations of Geri's restaurants had interior seating and an expanded menu. In 1981 the Geri's corporation folded, but several stores continued to operate independently. The last Geri's was in Beloit, Wisconsin, which closed in 1999. There was an attempt to resurrect the Geri's nameplate in 2002.

Don Turnbull was cited as Publisher and Paul Cockburn as Assistant Editor throughout the majority of the lifetime of the publication.

Legacy Some of the official AD&D; material originally published in Imagine was collected and used in Unearthed Arcana. Imagine was also responsible for several creative spin-offs, notably the Pelinore gaming world. The magazine also featured the classic adventure game comic The Sword of Alabron in issues 1 to 16. This was briefly revived as a second story arc titled Auchter's Axe in issues 29 to 30 prior to the magazine's cancellation. When some TSR UK staffers were made redundant they started the publication Game Master in an attempt to preserve the experience of Imagine. Game Master included some popular features, such as Pelinore, and also ran various articles containing details on Imagine's closure which criticized Gary Gygax and TSR.

Gathering is a sewing technique for shortening the length of a strip of fabric so that the longer piece can be attached to a shorter piece. It is commonly used in clothing to manage fullness, as when a full sleeve is attached to the armscye or cuff of a shirt, or when a skirt is attached to a bodice. In simple gathering, parallel rows of running stitches are sewn along one edge of the fabric to be gathered. The stitching threads are then pulled or \\"drawn up\\" so that the fabric forms small folds along the threads.Caulfield, S.F.A. and B.C. Saward, The Dictionary of Needlework, 1885, facsimile edition, Blaketon Hall, 1989, p. 219 Picken, Mary Brooks: The Fashion Dictionary, Funk and Wagnalls, 1957. (1973 edition ) Gathering seams once involved tedious hand sewing of basting, which was time consuming, especially with heavy fabric. However, finer gathers could be achieved. Now, a quick and easy way to make a gather is to use a wide zigzag stitch with a sewing machine. Both the upper and lower thread are pulled long and placed in front of the sewing machine. Then zigzagging is carefully sewed over top of the two threads without catching the threads as it is sewn. At the end the thread is pulled and is then gathered.

This zigzag gathering technique is the strongest and most sturdy method of gathering. Types *Pleating or plaiting is a type of gathering in which the folds are usually larger, made by hand and pinned in place, rather than drawn up on threads, but very small pleats are often identical to evenly spaced gathers. Pleating is mainly used to make skirts, but can have other uses.(See main article Pleat.)Caulfield and Saward, The Dictionary of Needlework *Shirring or gauging is a decorative technique in which a panel of fabric is gathered with many rows of stitching across its entire length and then attached to a foundation or lining to hold the gathers in place.

It is the fourth-brightest globular cluster in the sky, after Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae and Messier 22, respectively. It is best seen from June to October in the Southern Hemisphere. NGC 6752 was first identified by one James Dunlop of Parramatta on 30 June 1826, who described it as an irregular bright nebula which could be resolved into a cluster of many stars, highly compressed at the centre. This corresponds with a core region densely populated with stars around 1.3 light- years in diameter, which indicates it has undergone core collapse. The cluster lies around 13,000 light-years distant and is one of the closer globular clusters to Earth. It also lies 17,000 light-years away from the galactic centre. It belongs to Shapley‚ÄìSawyer Concentration Class VI, namely of intermediate density, and has been calculated to be 11.78 billion years old. There are many binary stars in the system, as well as blue stragglers, which are likely to have been formed by collisions and mergers of smaller stars. The apparent magnitude of the cluster is 5.4, so it can be seen with the unaided eye. However this depends on good viewing conditions with a minimum of light pollution. With binoculars it can be seen to cover an area three quarters the size of the full moon. It lies 1.5 degrees east of 5th-magnitude Omega Pavonis. The nearest bright star is Peacock, which lies 3.25 degrees north and 9.25 degrees east. Six X-ray sources have been identified in the cluster's core by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.
