It is involved in the homeostasis and repair of the kidney, and holds therapeutic potential for treatment of kidney failure. Structure Strong evidence suggests that renal stem cells are located in the renal papilla. Using stain-retaining assay (with bromodeoxyuridine, or BrdU), a low-cycling cell population was found in the papillary region, which was able to divide rapidly to repair the damaged caused by transcient renal ischemia. These cells are able to incorporate into other renal tissues, and was able to repeatedly form spheres in 3D cultures, and clonal analysis also exhibited its multipotency. Other reports have suggested the renal tubule and renal capsule to be the site of stem cells. The renal capsule contain stain-retaining cells which exhibited markers for mesenchymal stem cells; after their removal, recovery was significantly slower post-ischemic injury. These evidence suggests a stem cell population exists within the renal capsule. Development Using in vivo lineage tracing techniques, Lgr5+ cells were found to contribute to the nephron, specifically to the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule. Thus, Lgr5+ cells can potentially be a marker for renal stem and/or progenitor cells. Clinical significance There is much debate regarding the cells involved in repair after injury; while some suggests that stem cells are the sole driving force of repair, others suggests that cells dedifferentiate after damage to act like stem cells. Alternately, it was also reported that differentiated tubular epithelial cells are the driving mechanism for regeneration after injury, using proliferative expansion as the mechanism. Multipotent mouse kidney progenitor cells (MKPC) were obtained from Myh9 targeted mutant mice. Injection of MKPC into mice post-ischemic injury saw the MKPC regenerating different cell lineages and was able to regenerate renal function and enhanced survival. Renal induced pluripotent stem cells It has been reported that endogenous kidney tubular renal epithelial cells can be dedifferentiated into induced pluripotent stem cells by the treatment of only two factors - Oct4 and Sox2.

The main body of the round holds dual-purpose anti-tank/anti-personnel submunitions. The MAT-120 submunitions are unique in that to prevent the dangers of unexploded duds, there is a double redundant feature the manufacturer refers to as self- destruction and self-sterilization. This prevents unexploded MAT-120 submunitions from lying around becoming de facto landmines, dangerous to both combatants and non-combatants.Note 1: Which was one of the chief complaints against the use of submunitions, which resulted in many nations signing an international treaty calling for them to be banned and all stockpiles destroyed. Description In the late 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia, which later became part of Instalaza SA, developed a 120mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 dual anti-armor/fragmentation submunitions, each of which weighs 275 grams and is 37 millimeters in diameter. What made the 120mm MAT-120s submunition unique is the electrical impact fusing system which for all practical purposes totally eliminated the risk of unexploded duds from subsequently detonating. In addition there is no electrical energy stored in the MAT-120 round during storage, transport and even at the time it is fired from the mortar tube, thus greatly reducing any risk of premature detonation. The MAT-120 submunition's electronic impact fuse operates on a capacitor power source located in each submunition which is charged in flight after being fired by a wind generator located in the nose of the projectile. If for what ever reason the electrical fuse fails to function on impact, approximately 35 seconds later a self-destruction feature causes the submunition to detonate; if the self-destruction mechanism fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, rendering the dud submunition inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source.\\"Mortars Aim For More Capability\\" by Rubert Pengelley, Jane's IDR 1/1997 page 54note2 - the first MAT-120 mortar bomb' submunition were called \\"Espin\\" by the manufacture and lacked the self-destruction feature, later MAT-120 submunitions with the self-destruction feature were called \\"Braco\\" The action of firing the round starts a timer which triggers opening the projectile, scattering the submunitions, which land in a random pattern between fifty and sixty meters in diameter. Upon impact the submunitions detonate, producing an armour-penetrating effect capable of punching through 150 millimeters of RHAnote3 - which is more than adequate to defeat the top armour protection of even the heaviest main battle tank in service today and scattering 650 steel fragments out to a lethal radius of around 6 meters, and an effective radius of 18 meters.Jane's Ammunition Handbook 2003-2004 Within the impact area, the probability of hitting a tank-sized target directly is about 20 percent. History Later a similar mortar round was offered in the 81mm caliber and equipped some Spanish Marine units. Following the signing the Wellington Declaration on Cluster Munitions, Spain withdrew the projectiles from its military units. It had destroyed most of its stockpile of 2,271 120mm MAT-120 projectiles by the end of 2008, retaining 419 (and 390 of its ESPIN predecessor) for permitted training and countermeasure development purposes. (In its 2011 Convention on Cluster Munition submission, the Spanish government reported that the number retained had fallen to 366 MAT-120 and 331 ESPIN) The Spanish Government has refused all export licence applications for cluster munitions, including this weapon, from 11 June 2008 onwards although as of April 2011 it is still listed on the product page of Instalaza's website, In April 2011, there were news media reports of Libyan forces loyal to Gaddafi using MAT-120 mortar rounds against the besieged city of Misrata, although the Secretary of State of the US, Hillary Clinton said she was \\"not aware\\" of the specific use of cluster or other indiscriminate weapons in Misurata. The markings on some of the remnants indicated that they came from the second and third production batches of 2007. The Daily Telegraph reported that the manufacturer stated that the weapons were sold to Libya in 2008, prior to the Spanish Government ratifying the convention.

Each issue contains essays on current theory, history, an exchange of hot topics, as well as one or two book reviews. History The magazine was founded in the summer of 1956 Aur√©l Bern√°th, Tibor D√©ry, Gyula Illy√©s, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, and Georg Lukacs, and Istv√°n M√©sz√°ros ‚Äì a disciple of Luk√°cs - was asked to be acting editor. However, because of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, only two \\"emigrant\\" editions were published in London, in 1958. \\"Eszm√©let\\" is the title of a poem by Attila J√≥zsef, the famous Hungarian poet. The journal reappeared in 1989, this time in Hungary. Since 1993 editor in chief was L√°szl√≥ Andor, since 2009 also European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. The journal's articles show a radical and consistent criticism of capitalism. It aims to represent social solidarity, individual freedom and human dignity. In the past two decades, various organizations were formed around the journal (Friends of Eszm√©let, Open University of Eszm√©let). Their events are open to anyone. The twentieth anniversary of the journal's foundation was celebrated in Moscow with an issue in Russian. Editorial Board Eszter Bartha, P√©ter B√≥zs√≥, √Åd√°m F√ºl√∂p, G√°bor K√°llai R., Matthias I.

History The original line-up was formed by Nicholas Stuart, Matthew Reetz, Michael Ziemann, and Jon Jon Fries in 2006 in Appleton, Wisconsin. Each had previously been a part of indie-rock band Number One Fan. Shortly after the recording of their debut album, Michael Ziemann left the band and was replaced by Hugh Masterson. Their debut album Golden Daze, released on Universal Republic in 2007, was written in Matthew Reetz's hunting cabin in north woods Wisconsin. It was produced by Greg Fidelman (U2, Tom Petty, Johnny Cash) and engineered by Greg Gordon (Oasis, JET, Hot Hot Heat). The album was reviewed by David Fricke in the January 24, 2008, issue of Rolling Stone. The Wildbirds spent only 6 months on tour before taking an undefined hiatus in early 2008. Stuart relocated to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and then to Portland, Oregon. Fries moved to Woodstock, Illinois, where he pursued other musical interests. Reetz settled back in Appleton, Wisconsin, with his wife, Emily. Masterson spent time traveling between New York, Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, and Wisconsin.http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId;=36229960&blogId;=531521675 In February 2010, singer Nicholas Stuart announced The Wildbirds were once again active with an entirely new line-up. Stuart had reconnected with Masterson and moved to Milwaukee to begin writing music. The result, a 6-song EP entitled \\"Sunshine Blues\\", will be released on July 22, 2010. Publicity Their song \\"Suzanna\\" was featured on Little Steven's Underground Garage 'The Coolest Songs in the World Vol. 6'. \\"421 (Everybody Loves You)\\" was played on national television when Brett Favre threw his record-breaking 421st touchdown pass on October 1, 2007. The band cites this number was a mere coincidence. The band performed at the 2008 Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado. The song \\"421 (Everybody Loves You)\\" was featured in ESPN's commercials leading up to the event, and \\"Hard on Me\\" was played during a feature on Levi LaVallee.

Adult specimens usually have seven convex whorls in total, with an inconspicuous suture, and a tall, conical spire that corresponds to 3/4 of the total shell length. The apex bears a large, inflated, dome-like protoconch with two whorls and a characteristic sculpture pattern. It initially has a smooth surface (1/3 whorl), which suddenly becomes ornamented by a series of strong axial ribs. By the second whorl, it gradually changes into a net-like pattern of axial ribs and spiral cords, bearing small nodules at the intersections. This intricate sculpture is absent in the teleoconch whorls, which are solely sculptured by strong, rounded spiral cords. The aperture outline is elliptical, with a thickened peristome and a well-marked callus. The columella bears two strong folds, and the canal is short and curved. The shell is colored light orange to dark-reddish brown, with a usually darker protoconch.

In 1978, they signed up to a five album recording contract with Virgin. Their debut album, Big Oceans, produced by Colin Thurston, was released in 1978 consisted of both hard-edged power pop (\\"You Didn't Have to Lie to Me\\", \\"Academies to Anger\\") and more expansive, somber material (\\"Shipyards\\") that signaled the direction the band were to take on their second effort. Peter Gabriel also did a session with the band, producing demo versions of \\"You Didn't Have to Lie to Me\\", \\"That Kind of Boy\\" and \\"Shipyards\\", and these were subsequently released as archive material. For that next album, Snakes and Lovers (released in the U.S. eponymously titled Interview with different artwork and without the words \\"Snakes and Lovers\\" on the sleeve), which was produced by Mick Glossop, they brought in bassist Alfie Agius, who was associated with The Teardrop Explodes.

The station was on the Devizes branch line, between Pans Lane Halt and Bromham & Rowde.  Early plans  The idea of having a railway station in Devizes was first conceived in 1830 before the Great Western Railway (GWR) had begun to construct their main lines. Devizes was regularly considered by the GWR as a main stop on its London to Bristol Line but lost out to Swindon due to its smaller population and lower growth rate. A station in Devizes was needed to support industry and agriculture in the town, as its only transport route was the Kennet and Avon Canal, opened in 1810. A branch to Devizes was included in plans for the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, authorised by Parliament in 1845, but that company was sold to the GWR in 1850.  West from Devizes  In 1854 the GWR finally began to build from near on the former WS&WR; line eastward to Devizes, completing the branch in 1857. Devizes station opened on 1 July 1857. After starting with seven trains a day, services were reduced to four a day, most probably due to overinflated claims of traffic before the line was built.  East from Devizes  In 1862, the GWR extended its Reading-Hungerford line westward via to Devizes, reaching the station through a tunnel under Devizes Castle. This began the busiest period for the station, with trains running from London through Devizes to either Bath and Bristol or the West Country. Traffic on the line reduced from 1900 after the GWR opened the Stert and Westbury Railway between Patney and Chirton and Westbury, which by-passed the steep gradients of Devizes and provided a faster route from London.  Closure  The Devizes line and all its stations were closed in 1966 under the Beeching Axe; the track was taken up and the station buildings were later demolished. Today there is little trace of a railway station in Devizes. The road bridge over the old Pans Lane Halt station and the footbridge at Devizes remain. The tunnel built under Devizes Castle has been bricked up at one end and is a commercial property at the other end (a shooting range as of 2011). In place of the station, there is now a public car park and a new property development, both on Station Road.  Future plans  In 2018, proposals were made for a station at Clock Inn Park, Lydeway, southeast of Devizes where the Reading‚ÄìTaunton line is crossed by the A342 road. In 2020 the project received funding from the Department for Transport for a feasibility study.

Tarfon had given him when an event occurred to him.Tosefta, Demai 5:24 (in Hebrew); The Talmud did not record anything on his personal life, except for one reference Babylonian Talmud, Bava Kamma 80a where, according to a version noted by Abraham Zacuto, Solomon Luria, as well as in Dikdukei Soferim, it is said that his family were \\"House proprietors in the Upper Galilee\\", until they went bankrupt as a Heavenly punishment over their heedlessness on \\"Dinei mamon\\" (Halakhic property rights), by herding their sheep on other people's territory, and by giving rulings on \\"Dinei mamon\\" in the presence of only one judge.

The extended project was devised by Sir Mike Tomlinson in 2006, during his review of 16- to 19-year-olds' education.Schools consulted on new project. BBC News (May 2006). Accessed 18 April 2010. It was a compulsory part of the 14‚Äì19 Diploma taken by students in England and Wales between 2008 and 2013.  Description  All students may take an extended project as a free-standing qualification, following a recommendation by the examination boards of England and Wales (Edexcel, OCR, AQA, WJEC, Eduqas and CIE) and England's qualifications authority, the QCA.Extended project for all call. BBC News (May 2009). Accessed 18 April 2010. The students' choice of topic is free, although they must show that it is academically useful, either related to their current course of study, or their future career. It takes the form of either a dissertation (5,000 words being a common guideline) or a number of other forms: a musical or dramatical composition, report or artefact, backed up with paperwork. David MacKay, head of the 14-19 curriculum at the QCA, is in favour of EPQs, saying: \\"Extended projects can help students to develop and demonstrate a range of valuable skills through pursuing their interests and investigating topics in more depth.\\" It has also been praised by universities for guiding students into higher education (typically universities). According to the QCA, an extended project is \\"a single piece of work requiring a high degree of planning, preparation, research and autonomous working.\\" The number of students taking up the EPQ is growing dramatically. Around 30,000 students took the EPQ recently and this is growing by the year. Universities look positively at an EPQ and value its rigorous academic content and the vast amount of time taken to complete this. An EPQ contains 100% coursework, there is no exam and students tend to take this up in their second year in sixth form. This is because the project helps students to gain a lot of new information and explore their interests in depth after the transition of A-levels. It also indicates a heavy interest in a particular subject which is useful for those applying to university.  Effect of 2020 pandemic  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in summer 2020 EPQ grades were awarded according to assessments made by teachers.

The station opened in the summer of 1888 and by the following year it served a small community consisting of six fishing clubs, two saloons, and a hotel. The area was known as a popular fishing ground for weakfish and boats could be hired at the docks. The Rockaway Beach Branch was electrified on July 26, 1905.

The book is about overcoming the denial that leads to common addictions while bringing guidance to those struggling with addiction. Face It and Fix It has been said to \\"leave you with a greater sense of self-awareness and the skills you need to both improve your relationships and to live the life you deserve\\". Interventionist work Seeley has remained involved, professionally and personally, in recovery since 1989. In an early episode of Intervention he revealed he was once addicted to crystal meth. He became sober on July 14, 1989.

In 2007, Ken held one of the first trainings for interventionists in London and now conducts up to five intervention trainings a year. After years in the recovery industry, Ken realized that recovery is a process and takes time. Addicts do not stay sober with just an intervention and treatment; it is all about the continuum of care and subsequent follow-up, just like any other illness. In 2008, Intervention911 initiated the RAP program which supports the recovery process for addicts and their families for one to five years. In 2011, Seeley opened Ken Seeley Communities, a sober living community in Palm Springs, California, and in 2015 opened an Intensive Outpatient Program to help create the seamless continuum of care to support the person suffering with an addiction. By offering services pre- and post- treatment, Seeley has sought to provide all the supportive services around treatment. Seeley's personal experience of addiction and recovery fuels his desire to impact others in similar situations. Ken grasps the full understanding of the addict's behavior. His innate compassion for fellow addicts continually bolsters his ability to connect and communicate with addicts and their families. Seeley has applied his personal struggle with addiction to the intervention equation. This is an asset that has become a valuable catalyst in Intervention911's and Seeley's Communities impressive results. Seeley's remarkable success rate has turned him into one of the most sought-after interventionists in the country.

Life She was the posthumous and only child of Edward Talbot, second son of William Talbot, bishop of Durham, and his wife Mary (died 1784), daughter of George Martyn, prebendary of Lincoln. Her uncle Charles Talbot, another son of the bishop, was Lord Chancellor. Her father, Edward, who was elected fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and appointed archdeacon of Berkshire in 1717, died on 9 December 1720. At the time of his death Catherine Benson (sister of Martin Benson, bishop of Gloucester) was residing at his house, and on her marriage to Thomas Secker, a prot√©g√© of Talbot, in 1725, Mrs. Talbot and Catherine, who were not well-off, went to live with the newly married couple and remained members of the household until Secker's death in 1768. Catherine's education was superintended by Secker. She became learned in the Scriptures and an accomplished linguist. She also painted in watercolours and read widely. As a child her talent was recognised, for example by Thomas Rundle. February 1741 saw the beginning of her lifelong friendship with Elizabeth Carter; the introduction was by Wright, Miss Talbot's tutor in astronomy. The two ladies carried on a lively and copious correspondence. As Secker was successively rector of St. James's, Westminster, bishop of Oxford, dean of St. Paul's, and finally in 1758 archbishop of Canterbury, Catherine Talbot frequented the society of her time. She knew among others Bishop Butler, Lord Lyttelton, William Pulteney, earl of Bath, Mrs. Montagu, the Duchess of Somerset, with whom she often stayed at Percy Lodge, and Samuel Richardson. Richardson discussed Sir Charles Grandison with her and Elizabeth Carter, adopted their suggestions, and sent them parts of the novel to read before publication. Catherine Talbot visited Richardson at North End, Hammersmith. She also encouraged Carter to translate Epictetus, and corresponded with her on the subject while the work was in progress. During the whole period of her residence with him Catherine Talbot was Secker's almoner. In 1760, accompanied by Elizabeth Carter, she went to Bristol for her health. Secker died in 1768, leaving to Mrs. Talbot and her daughter ¬£13,000 in the public funds. The ladies moved from Lambeth Palace to Lower Grosvenor Street. There Catherine died of cancer on 9 January 1770, aged 48. Several poems were written in her praise. Works Her health prevented continuous work, but she wrote essays and detached pieces in a ‚Äògreen book,‚Äô constantly referred to by her friends. They were unable to persuade her to publish her compositions. She contributed, however, one paper to Samuel Johnson‚Äôs The Rambler (No. xxx., 30 June 1750). Mrs. Talbot put her daughter's manuscripts into Elizabeth Carter's hand, leaving their publication to her discretion. In 1770 Elizabeth Carter published at her own expense Catherine Talbot's Reflections on the Seven Days of the Week, a work that was constantly reprinted. The Reflections are on religious and moral topics. In 1772 another book by Catherine Talbot, Essays on Various Subjects, was published. It contained essays, dialogues, prose pastorals, a fairy tale, imitations of Ossian, allegories, and a few original poems. Between 1772 and 1819 several collected editions of her works appeared. Her correspondence with Elizabeth Carter, published in 1809, shows an interest in public affairs, observation of men and manners, and affection for her friends.

He took part as a supporter of Charles Edward Stuart and after the rebellion was crushed he went into hiding. He was the uncle of poet James Macpherson, who wrote (or translated) the Ossian poems about fallen heroes.  Early life  Ewan MacPherson (called Cluny) was born on 11 February 1706. He was the first born son of Lachlan MacPherson of Nuide (1674-1746). His mother was Jean Cameron, daughter of Sir Ewan Cameron of Lochiel. Cluny grew up to be a respected individual. His father-in-law, Lord Lovat, described him as \\"a thorrow good natur‚Äôd, even temper‚Äôd, honest gentleman\\". Physically he was described as \\"of a low stature, very square, and a dark brown complection\\".  Clan MacPherson  The territory of the Clan MacPherson covered Badenoch, south-east of Loch Ness, but the Macphersons were also part of a federation of other clans, called the Chattan Confederation (also called Clan Chattan). This alliance, which dated back to the 13th century, included the Mackintoshes, MacGillivrays, Davidsons, Shaws and others. A meeting of these allied clans in 1724 established that leadership was with the Mackintoshes.  1742  Donald Cameron of Lochiel The year 1742 marked his arrival into the interconnected world of Scottish affairs. On marrying Lord Lovat's daughter Jean (Jenny) in 1742, Cluny took over management of his father's estate. At the request of the Duke of Gordon (the clan's feudal superior), he undertook to protect a wide area of land from cattle thieving. Also in 1742, he signed a Bond of Friendship with his father- in-law Simon Fraser (Chief of Clan Fraser) and with his cousin, Donald Cameron (Chief of Clan Cameron), ‚Äòbinding themselves and their followers to stand by and support each other‚Äô. This was an attempt to loosen the tie to the Mackintoshes, and may have been a factor in his later recruitment to the Jacobite cause.  The '45  In August 1745, with rumours of a Jacobite uprising circulating, the government offered Cluny command of an independent company in Lord Loudon's regiment. This required swearing an oath of allegiance to George II. Once Charles Edward Stuart raised his standard at Glenfinnan in that same month, Cluny was in a bind. His clan had been Jacobite in 1715, but not all were similarly inclined thirty years later. A historian has noted that he ‚Äòhad no particular reason, economic, political or religious, strong enough to propel him into the Jacobite camp‚Äô. Moreover, his wife Jenny wanted her husband to remain faithful to the government. Cluny did remain loyal to the government, to the extent of turning up with his company to assist the Government general John Cope on his march north in August 1745 to head off the Jacobite army. However, as it was understrength, he was sent back by Cope to raise more troops. Then, whilst home in Cluny Castle on the night of 28 August, he was taken prisoner by a Jacobite raiding party composed of Camerons (his mother's family). To some extent, he may have wanted to be taken prisoner. Taken to Perth, he emerged within two weeks as a newly minted colonel in the Jacobite army. Battle of Culloden He went north to raise troops for the Jacobite cause, but needed to use both persuasion and threats of violence to raise about 300 men. He was present at the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September, when Cope's forces were routed in a 15-minute battle. He met Bonnie Prince Charlie at Holyrood House in Edinburgh in late October. In December he took part in an attack on the Duke of Cumberland's cavalry, at the Skirmish of Clifton Moor, near Penrith. He was also present at the Battle of Falkirk in January 1746. By February, with the Jacobite army retreating northwards, Cluny was sent ahead to raise more men, ‚Äòburning the houses and killing the cattle of any reluctant to serve‚Äô. Overall, his contribution to the Jacobite cause could be described (as it was by Lord George Murray in March) as ‚Äòindefatigable‚Äô. He was not present at the Battle of Culloden in April, and went on the run after the Jacobite defeat there. His clansman surrendered in June, the same month Cluny House was plundered and burnt. On the last day of June, his elderly father Lachlan died ‚Äòof a broken heart among the ruins of his son‚Äôs estate‚Äô. His father-in-law Lovat was captured by government forces in this same month, whilst his cousin Cameron of Lochiel escaped to France in October with the Prince.  In hiding  Ben Alder Cluny spent the next nine years in hiding with a price on his head. In winter he was relatively safe from discovery. In summer, with troops on patrol, he led an itinerant existence. A report by a government officer suggested he ‚Äòhaunts the houses of his kindred and his wife‚Äôs in the day time, and he has proper places of retirement in the night time, to which he repairs by turns, according to the danger he (fears) he‚Äôs in, from the different motions of the troops‚Äô. He had many hiding places, although his most famous one was a small cave on Ben Alder, known as ‚Äòthe Cage‚Äô. It was in an area ‚Äòfull of great stones and crevices and some scattered wood interspersed‚Äô. Luckily, the colour of the rock obscured any smoke. > The Cage was no larger than to contain six or seven persons, four of which > number were frequently employed in playing at cards, one idle looking on, > one becking (baking), and another firing bread and cooking‚Äô It is here he spent a week with Charles Edward Stuart in September. It is also where the fictional character David Balfour meets Cluny in the novel Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson.  Escape to France  In September 1754, Charles Edward Stuart (then living incognito in Paris) asked Cluny to come, and to bring any effects or money he had left over from the rebellion, ‚Äòfor I hapen to be in great strets‚Äô. So, still with a price on his head Cluny travelled through Edinburgh and arrived in London, where he spent several days among Jacobite sympathisers (possibly at the home of his wife's half-brother, Archibald Fraser). He then went to Dover and arrived in Calais in May 1755. His Prince had moved to Basel, Switzerland at that point, which is where Cluny also went. It was not a happy reunion. The often intoxicated Prince expected Cluny to account for the large sum of money given to him in 1746 to distribute among the disaffected and ‚Äòto keep up the spirit of Jacobitism‚Äô. This money became known as the Loch Arkaig Treasure, and is rumoured to still be buried there.  Later life  His wife Jenny and daughter Margaret, aged 14, soon joined him in France. His son Duncan (b 1748) stayed behind to be educated in Inverness. By 1763 he was living in some poverty in Dunkirk. After a long ailment, he died there on 30 June 1764. He was buried in the Garden of the Carmelites, with his wife refusing French military honours at his funeral, since they had not supported him financially. (He held a commission in the Royal Ecossais regiment but the pay was meagre). His wife Jenny returned to Edinburgh, where she died the following year.  Descendants  His daughter Margaret (1743-1808) married her cousin, Duncan Macpherson. Unfortunately, all of their children died without issue, three in the service of Britain: John died in India, Simon drowned at sea, Adam died at the Battle of Cape St Vincent, Ewan in childhood, whilst the youngest Robert died of old age but unmarried. His son Duncan (1748-1817) continued his education on the continent, and had become a captain in the British army by the time he was 23, eventually serving with the 63rd Regiment of Foot in the American War of Independence. Whilst in North America he joined the 71st Fraser Highlanders as a major in 1776, rising to Lieutenant-Colonel and participating in several battles. On returning to Britain in 1781, he was captured by an American privateer and spent 16 months as a prisoner-of-war in New England before returning home. An Act of Parliament in 1784 restored Colonel Duncan MacPherson to the estates of his father. At the age of 50 he married a second cousin, Catherine Cameron, and they had four sons and four daughters together.  References  Bibliography  * Duffy, Christopher (2003) The ‚Äô45.

It is about south of Shrewsbury and north of Church Stretton. Geography The village is located on the A49 road, north of Church Stretton and south of the village of Dorrington. Nearby villages include Longnor (approximately 1¬Ω miles to the north) and All Stretton which is 2 miles distant, between Leebotwood and Church Stretton. Leebotwood is the only recognisable settlement in the parish. The Welsh Marches railway line runs through the parish, and there was once a small railway station, though today the nearest station is Church Stretton. The Cound Brook passes through the village, flowing north towards Longnor. The parish was part of the borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham, which existed 1973‚Äì2009. It continues to be part of the Parliamentary constituency of Shrewsbury and Atcham and in the area of Shropshire's unitary Council. History Leebotwood's parish church (St Mary's) dates from the 12th century and is a plain and simple building in comparison to its many neighbouring churches, including Church Stretton's St Laurence's Church. It is the burial place of the Corbett family of Longnor Hall, the local lords of the manor. A valley between Leebotwood and Caer Caradoc was important as a thoroughfare dating right back to Roman times. The eastern boundary of the village was formed from the ancient route of Watling Street which is still visible today. Caer Caradoc to the south of Leebotwood rises to a height of 1506 ft and is said to be one of the last strongholds of the native chief \\"Caradoc\\" or \\"Caractacus\\" who held out against the Romans. Etymology The whole area was covered in thick forest, called \\"Botwde\\" (as the area was recorded in the Domesday Book) or \\"Bottewode\\" (as written in 1170)Poulton-Smith, A (2009) Shropshire Place Names p 80 until later in medieval times. Henry II granted this area to Augustinian canons with a chapel at Lega - hence the placename of \\"Lega in Bottewode\\" (1170) and in modern times \\"Leebotwood\\". Nearby, in the parish of Church Stretton, is Botvyle, which also derives its name from the historic forest.

It has developed the airport named as Kazi Nazrul Islam International Airport. It is being developed in association with Singapore's Changi Airports International (CAI) and constructed by Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Limited (BAPL). The airport city is constructed around an old airfield RAF Station Andal and used by the RAF in Andal, and also by the USAAF during World War II. On 7 September 2007, the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and the West Bengal government announced plans to set up a new airport ‚Äì along with a township, IT and logistics hub ‚Äì at Durgapur subdivision. Marking the start of the Aerotropolis Project in Andal, the Andal Aerotropolis Project is spread over approximately in the Asansol Durgapur Planning Area (ADPA) of Burdwan District in West Bengal. Bestowed with premium facilities and unparalleled opportunities in the fields of power-intensive industries, mining, iron and steel, metalwork, engineering, petrochemicals, Information Technology (IT) and telecommunications, ADPA has proved to be an ideal destination for investors. The current placement of Domestic Airport promises to pave a smooth way for plans to fulfill passenger and cargo traffic requirements. As planned, an Integrated Township, IT Park, and logistics hub will see the light of the day along with the Andal Aerotropolis Project. These will help in enhancing the growth prospects of Asansol-Durgapur Region. BAPL has completed most of its legal procedures, receiving the In-Principal Clearance from the Ministry of Civil Aviation as well as getting the Land Use Development Control Plan (LUDCP) approved by Asansol Durgapur Development Authority (ADDA). It has also entered into a Technical Services Agreement with Changi Airports India Pte Ltd, Singapore. In the area both Burnpur and Durgapur have airstrips for the landing of small planes. The airfield at Panagarh is under Indian Air Force. Narayana Schools have an operating school on the premises. Moreover a logistics hub of Spectrum Logistics has been set up and is operational (used by Asian Paints). Another company Ardex Endura, which is a ceramic factory, have started their operations in the aerotropolis. Keventer Agro has one of its operational unit in the Sujalaam Skycity. Two to three new schools have already come up on the premises of the airport. Fortune group of hotels has announced its intention to start a four-star hotel like the one in City Centre. Mission hospital is also set to construct its unit there. Lemon tree Hotels have agreed to set up an 80 roomed mid priced luxury hotel in the Sujalaam Skycity.

Played between three and five people, these competing Daimy≈çs attempt to gain 50 Daimy≈ç honor through territorial conquest, samurai honor, or a surplus of combat katanas. During play, the current Daimy≈ç assigns role cards to the other players which last until the end of the current Daimy≈ç's turn. These role cards are: Samurai who will lead the Daimy≈ç's forces into combat, Bushi who will be defending their territory, Sensei who will be providing council and utilizing effects, and (only in 5 player games) Hatamoto who has the option to lead a revolt against the Daimy≈ç. The players have 12 months to reach 50 Daimy≈ç honor, although this time may be extended by effects.  Equipment and set up  Bushido utilizes a vast array of tiles and chips to provide a unique gaming experience to the players. Bushido comes with 32 Hexagonal squares to be used as the playing board, a smaller score board, a variety of square support tiles and circular tactics tiles, 33 troop markers in 5 colors, and 5 character cards. Bushido is played on a Hex map made up of several different tiles. These tiles are shuffled and arranged face down so that the game has a different board each time. Players then take turns picking a base (which they leave face down), and then flipping tiles they want until all players control 6 tiles. Play begins with the oldest player, going clockwise. To offset the benefit of going first, while the first person draws 10 support tiles, the second person draws 11, the third twelve, and so on. All player count up their Daimy≈ç honor on the board (the green symbol), and then add up their rice and swords. Players then place a number of troops on the board equivalent to their rice total. All this information is recorded on a small board provided with the game. Players then draw 4 tactics tokens each, and place their samurai honor at 10. Players must always have 4 tactics tokens, and if they lose one they must immediately draw back to 4. Play then begins  Game play  On each Daimy≈ç's turn, they first draw a number of support tiles equal to their sword count, and ensure their troop total is equal to their rice total. They then have the option of calling a tea ceremony to exchange Daimy≈ç honor for Samurai honor, although this is usually only done if the Daimy≈ç has a significant amount of samurai honor. The Daimy≈ç then passes out the character cards to the other players, assigning the Bushi as the target of his attack. The Sensei is now allowed to play any effects he wishes, such as looking at another players hand or skipping the current Daimy≈ç's turn. Other players may then do the same, although it is twice as costly for them to do so. If Hatamoto is present he draws two additional tokens, and can place Ronins on the board. Hatamoto then has the option of leading the Ronin into revolt against the Daimy≈ç, causing combat between Hatamoto and the Daimy≈ç. If the Daimy≈ç wins the Ronins are removed, but if Hatamoto wins the territory becomes neutral. The Daimy≈ç can then position his troops to where he wishes to invade. Combat then begins between the Samurai- led Daimy≈ç's forces and then Bushi, with the winner collecting samurai honor. If the Samurai wins the territory falls under the control of the current Daimy≈ç and scores are adjusted. If the Samurai loses he faces the council of the Sensei, where the Sensei decides how to punish the Samurai. punishments range from 0, 2-10 honor points or Seppuku, although the Daimy≈ç has final say on if he agrees. The Sensei then determines if all players should 'call to arms' and receive additional support tokens, and if any player had the emperors symbol they may meet the emperor for aid. The game then progresses to the next player, and the time chart advances one month.  Combat  Combat in Bushido is resolved by a mix of tactics and katana. The tactics follow a rock- paper-scissors style, although other factors may make certain tactics more effective. The katana amounts are adjusted by the tactics and troop amounts then compared, with the player with the highest total winning. Only the Battle tactic allows players to include their troop totals. Generally, Duel defeats Battle, Battle defeats Ambush, and Ambush defeats Duel, with the Traitor tactic defeating all three. Other tokes result in automatic loss. Combat provides Samurai honor based on troops killed, honor of the territory being fought over, and any incentives the Daimy≈ç may have provided. Combat between Hatamoto and the Daimy≈ç does not award honor points to either participant.  Honor and winning the game  Except for the beginning, at no point can two players have the same Daimy≈ç or Samurai honor. If one player moves onto another players honor amount, the moving player progresses one additional square. Daimy≈ç honor is gained in three ways: Selling Katanas, acquiring territory, and converting Samurai honor. At the beginning of the Daimy≈çs turn they may place three yellow triple katana tokens back in the support tile bag in order to progress up one Daimy≈ç honor. the Daimy≈ç may do this as many times as they wish, although it must only be done at the beginning of their turn. When the Daimy≈ç gains territory they also gain the honor that territory provides, while if they lose a territory they lose any honor it provides. Samurai honor may only be converted to Daimy≈ç honor through a Tea Ceremony. The initiator (usually the Daimy≈ç) must invite another player to the tea ceremony. If the other player agrees the initiator gives them 5 samurai honor. the tea ceremony initiator may then convert as much samurai honor as they wish to Daimy≈ç honor, at a rate of two to one (i.e. 4 Samurai honor for 2 Daimy≈ç). If the other player refuses, they lose 10 samurai honor as well as one Daimy≈ç point for the disgrace. If players have less than 10 Samurai points they are not able to refuse a ceremony. Once a Daimy≈ç reaches 50 honor, they become the new emperor and win the game. Should no one reach this by the end of month 12, the Daimy≈ç with the highest honor total wins.  Strategy  The difficulty in Bushido is that all players are constantly regulating each other making it difficult to win. A samurai may throw a battle that would allow a Daimy≈ç to win, while players may save their best effects for the crucial last couple months. Overall, players whom hope to win have to aim to do so suddenly and without appearing as a threat, or face the wrath of the other players. In this way Bushido favors a diplomatic player over a militaristic player.  Sequels  Tanin the Stranger has recently been released in Europe as an expansion to the Bushido game.http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38707/bushido-der-weg- des-kriegers External links *  References  Category:Board games introduced in 2008 ","title":"Bushido (game)"},{"id":"27001294","text":"Meredith and Co. is a classic children's novel with a school setting by George Mills.

The second was effected on the Italian side by Jean-Antoine Carrel and Jean-Baptiste Bich with the abb√© Am√© Gorret and Jean-Augustin Meynet who followed them near to the summit. The party started from Breuil on 16 July and reached the top the following day. The successful ascent followed a long series of attempts that took place on the southwest ridge of the Matterhorn. The Italian side was considered easier than the Swiss side but despite appearances, the southern routes were harder, and parties repeatedly found themselves having to turn back. Since 2015, the route on the Italian side gained popularity, as the H√∂rnlih√ºtte on the Swiss side was rebuilt with a limited number of beds and charges a higher lodging fee. This popularity also brought a rising number of climbing accidents on the Italian route, while the number of the Swiss side dropped. Italienische Gemeinde schl√§gt Alarm - ZU VIELE BERGTOTE AM MATTERHORN [https://www.20min.ch/schweiz/news/story/Mehr-Tote-am-Matterhorn-wegen- teurerer-Huette--26988832 Schon 7 Tote 2018 ‚Äì auch wegen Schweizer H√ºtte - Auf der italienischen Seite des Matterhorns h√§ufen sich die Todesf√§lle. Daran hat auch die Schweizer H√∂rnlih√ºtte einen Anteil] Background and preparations Jean-Antoine Carrel Am√© Gorret The Valtournanche natives who started to facilitate the way up the southwest ridge of the Matterhorn for Felice Giordano and Quintino Sella, pitched their tent upon Whymper's third platform, at the foot of the Great Tower (12,992 ft), and enjoyed several days of bad weather under its shelter. On the first fine day (13 July) they began their work, and about midday on the 14th got on to the Shoulder, and arrived at the base of the final peak (the point where Tyndall and his guide Bennen stopped on 28 July 1862). The counsels of the party were then divided. Two ‚ÄîJean- Antoine Carrel and Joseph Maquignaz wished to go on; the others were reluctant. A discussion took place, and the result was they all commenced to descend, and whilst upon the \\"cravate\\" (13,524 ft) they heard Whymper and others crying from the summit. Upon the 15th they went down to Breuil and reported their ill-success to Giordano. \\"An evil day!\\" wrote the latter in his diary, dating the entry the 15th. \\"Early in the morning Carrel, more dead than alive, came to tell me he had been forestalled. He had reckoned on climbing to the top today, and expected to be able to force a passage not by the highest tower, which he considers impossible, but on the Zmutt side, where the snow is. I have decided that he and others shall at least try and ascend and plant our flag.\\"Edward Whymper, The Ascent of the Matterhorn, London, 1880, p. 304Guido Rey, The Matterhorn, translated by J. E. C. Eaton, 1907, p. 138 So Giordano attempted to recruit men from Breuil to make another attempt. He was in a most unfavourable position: he was at any rate uncertain whether the last bit was passable. The men who had been with Carrel steadily refused to try again, as if they were overcome with terror of the mountain. It was in vain that Giordano attempted to rouse them out of their depression, and explained to them that till that day he had expended money and labour for himself, with the object of being the first to reach the top; but that now, such good fortune being denied to him, he was only acting for the honour and in the interests of the guides of Valtournanche. The guides' replies were most discouraging but the abb√© Am√© Gorret came forward and offered to accompany Carrel. The latter accepted the volunteer, and thus two of those who, eight years before, had taken the first steps towards climbing the Matterhorn, were together in the last attempt. Carrel and Gorret would have set out by themselves had not Jean-Baptiste Bich and Jean-Augustin Meynet (two men in the employ of Favre the innkeeper) come forward at the last moment. Giordano would have joined them, but Carrel refused absolutely to take him with them; he said he would not have the strength to guide a traveller, and could neither answer for the result nor for any one's life. Giordano, for his own credit, desired Carrel to state as much in writing. At the end of the day he makes the following note in his pocket-book: \\"Walked a mile, suffering the pangs of disappointment. A very bad night with fever. Only one barometrical observation.\\" The ascent On Sunday, the 16th, after hearing mass at the chapel of Breuil, the party started. Giordano was left sad and lonely at Breuil. \\" I have once more made the great sacrifice of waiting at the foot of the peak instead of climbing it,\\" he wrote in another letter to Sella, \\"and I assure you that this has been most painful to me.\\" He saw them through his telescope pitching their tent at the customary bivouac at the foot of the Tower at 2 p.m. Am√© Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: \\"At last we crossed the Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!\\" The four men, having left Breuil at 6.30 a.m., arrived at the third tent platform at 1 a.m. and there passed the night. The passage of the cleft that separates the Pic Tyndall from the main peak, named the enjamb√©e, and that stopped Tyndall and Bennen, was accomplished. We were about to enter unknown country, \\"wrote Gorret,\\" for no man had gone beyond this point.\\" Rifugio Carrel (3,830 m) on the Lion ridge Then the party proceeded directly towards the summit, over rocks which for some distance were not particularly difficult until they reached a steeper part of the ridge. Here opinions were divided; Gorret suggested ascending by the ridge and scaling the last tower straight up. Carrel was inclined to traverse to the west of the peak, and thence go up on the Zmutt side. Naturally the wish of Carrel prevailed, for he was the leader and had not lost the habit of command, notwithstanding his defeat. The work at this part was of the very greatest difficulty, and stones and icicles which fell rendered the position of the party very precarious; so much so that they preferred to turn up directly towards the summit, and climb by rocks that Gorret termed \\"almost perpendicular.\\" The traverse back to the southwest ridge was one of the greatest difficulty and a falling stone wounded Gorret in the arm. They encountered great difficulty on the ridge, Gorret wrote \\"this part occupied the most time, and gave us the greatest trouble.\\" At length they arrived at a fault in the rocks which formed a roughly horizontal gallery. They crept along this in the direction of a ridge that descended towards the north-west, or thereabouts, and when close to the ridge, found that they could not climb on to it; but they perceived that, by descending a gully with perpendicular sides, they could reach the ridge at a lower point. The bold Am√© Gorret was the heaviest and the strongest of the four, and he was sacrificed for the success of the expedition. He and Meynet remained behind, and lowered the others, one by one, into the gully, \\"and as for me,\\" wrote Gorret, \\"in order not to be overcome by sleep, I pointed out to Meynet the beauty of the mountains and of the meadows in the valley.\\" Carrel and Bich clambered up the other side, attained the ridge descending towards the northwest, shortly afterwards gained an easy route and reached the southern end of the summit- ridge. Carrel and Bich only waited long enough to plant a flag by the side of the cairn that Whymper had built three days previously, then descended at once, rejoined the others. The final section Meanwhile, Giordano at the Jomein was writing in his diary as follows: \\"Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them. Then much mist about the summit. Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we saw our flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn. The English flag looked like a black shawl lying on the snow, in the centre.\\" All four hurried down as fast as possible to the tent and, at 9 p.m., arrived at their camp at the foot of the Great Tower. They followed as far as the Shoulder a route that was somewhat different from the one they had used on the ascent, and rather easier: that is to say, they traversed the whole length of the ledge of rock on the north-west face of the mountain, which ledge they had named the Corridor, and thus reached the point where the ar√™te of the Shoulder comes to an end against the final peak. This variant was afterwards used by Craufurd Grove, both on the ascent and the descent. On the following day at noon the climbers were back, safe and sound. Giordano's pocket-book mentions \\" Great hilarity all day at the hotel and at Breuil, bonfires and songs. Amid the rejoicing I alone was sad; I had not personally climbed the Matterhorn.\\" Giordano, sad at heart, fled from these festivities. Important business called him back to Turin; the weather had turned bad. Yet he wrote to Sella from Turin, saying: :\\"I wished to tell you that, if you wish, you may still climb the Matterhorn and gain some honour as the first 'Monsieur' to do it from the Italian side. So I have had the tent and some ropes left up there. Although we have been forestalled by Whymper, the victory from a practical point of view is ours, because we have now proved that the peak is accessible on our side, while it does not seem as if any other ascent would be attempted in a hurry from Zermatt. Poor Whymper is overcome by his ephemeral victory, while the Val Tournanche is full of joy at the sight of the three-coloured flag calmly waving on the lofty peak. You could still make scientific geological and barometrical observations up there; the peak might still be considered as virgin from this point of view, and we should thus give a solemn proof of the feasibility of the route on the Italian side, and of our calm perseverance in the face of the tragic upshot of the Zermatt ascent.\\" ReferencesSee also *Timeline of climbing the Matterhorn Category:Matterhorn Category:Mountaineering in the Alps Category:Mountaineering in Switzerland Category:Mountaineering in Italy Matterhorn, second ascent Category:History of the Alps ","title":"Second ascent of the Matterhorn"},{"id":"27001318","text":"Treborth Botanic Garden (Welsh: Gardd Fotaneg Treborth), is a botanic garden in Wales, close to the city of Bangor, Gwynedd. It is owned by Bangor University, and is used in teaching for University students, local schools and community groups. It is also open to the public without charge. It is unusual in having within the garden a large area of native established broad-leaved woodland bounded to the north by the seashore of the Menai Strait History of the Garden The current site was originally developed as a Victorian tourist destination, Britannia Park, by the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company in the 1840s. The grounds were designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, and features of his design can be see today, such as the lime avenue. However, due to a funding crisis the site was abandoned and reverted to pasture and woodland. Funding crises were to become a feature of the sites subsequent history. In 1960, the then University College of North Wales (now Bangor University) bought the land with the aim of developing it into a collection of plants for the University's Department of Botany. When the Department of Botany closed, the Garden continued to be used by other departments within the University for teaching, in particular for environmental courses. In recent years, Treborth Botanic Garden has come under threat of closure by Bangor University due to high maintenance costs, but this threat has been largely countered by the Friends of Treborth Botanic Garden, a volunteer group with charitable status that helps in the day-to-day running of the Garden, and the Students for Treborth Action Group (STAG), a Bangor University Students' Union society formed to safeguard the Garden for use by the students and population of Bangor. Treborth Botanic Garden is twinned with Katse Botanical Gardens in Lesotho and has a special relationship with Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in China. Facilities and Collections Indoor Treborth Botanic Garden has six glasshouses and a teaching laboratory with associated offices for the use of the curator and the volunteers in the main building complex. The Temperate Glasshouse features cacti, succulents, South African native plants and Canary Island native plants. The Tropical Glasshouse houses a variety of plants from the tropics including banana cultivars. The Orchid House and Bubble House contain the collections of orchids and carnivorous plants. Other glasshouses are used to house tender species from temperate zones, Welsh native flora, and for propagation and storage. The teaching lab doubles as a welcome area for visitors. A car park is situated outside the main building complex. Outdoor Away from the main buildings, Treborth features the largest rhizotron in Europe, a pigeon loft and meteorological recording equipment in a research compound . The garden has extensive outdoor grounds which extend all the way down to the shore of the Menai Strait. The grounds feature a half-acidic, half-basic rock garden, orchard and wildflower meadows alongside traditional outdoor planting. The majority of the grounds are woodlands designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. As part of special 50th Anniversary celebrations, which started with the annual musical fundraising festival Botanical Beats, a new wildlife pond was created and opened in June 2010. Access to the public The outdoor grounds are open to the public all year round. Treborth is one of the only botanic gardens in the United Kingdom that allows dogs, providing they are kept on a lead. The public are also allowed access to the glasshouses by appointment with the curator. Access to the garden is by a long private road, which is the left turn directly before crossing the Menai Suspension Bridge Anglesey-bound.

After a successful campaign along the west coast of the Duchy of Schleswig in the First Schleswig War, Hammer became a lighthouse inspector but quit service with the navy only a few years later. When the Second Schleswig War broke out, Hammer enlisted again as an officer and lead a flotilla in the North Frisian Islands. Despite an early success against Austro-Prussian forces he was later captured by a hostile expeditionary corps. Retiring again from military duties, Hammer became involved in politics and established a lumber and fishery business in Sweden. During that time he published his memoirs on the Second Schleswig War and also a text on fishery. Life Born in Huler√∏d, Hammer was the son of District Commissioner and Inspector Frederik Abel Hammer (d. 1877) and Elisabeth Kirstine Lemvigh (1794‚Äì1849). On 28 February 1851 he wedded Henriette Jacobine Hastrup (b. 3 September 1830 on Hjortholm Castle), daughter of Julianus Jensen Hastrup (1780‚Äì1863), squire on Hjortholm from 1823 to 1863, and of Anna Cecilie H√∏ffding (1791‚Äì1861).Balsved, Danish Naval History In 1837 Hammer joined the Danish Naval Academy as a cadet and was promoted to Sub Lieutenant on 3 August 1843. On an expedition to qualm uprisings in the Danish colonies in Guinea in 1854, he led the expeditionary forces to Fort Prinsensten and negotiated with the locals.Bricka, Dansk biografisk Lexikon, p. 535 During the First Schleswig War, Hammer served with a squadron that blocked traffic in the mouth of the river Elbe. In 1850 he became deputy commander of the squadron and operated from Fan√∏ off the Danish west coast. His forces occupied the islands Nordstrand and Pellworm and Hammer took part in the defense of the then Danish towns of T√∂nning and Friedrichstadt. On 3 August 1851, he was promoted to Lieutenant. After the war he was made a customs and lighthouse inspector at the west coast of the Duchy of Schleswig. Although Hammer quit his naval service in 1854, he was granted the character of a Lieutenant Commander on 17 February 1858. At the onset of the Second Schleswig War, Hammer enlisted again and commanded a flotilla of Danish naval units in the North Frisian Islands with his headquarters in Wyk auf F√∂hr. Initially, he successfully fought off superior Austro-Prussian forces. But when requested reinforcements did not arrive and his opponents were able to capture the island of Sylt and then F√∂hr, Hammer himself was taken prisoner by Prussian Lieutenant Ernst von Prittwitz und Gaffron on 19 July 1864 in Wyk, and was held captive until August of that year.

His enemies described him as a \\"Viking who terrorised the land and the people (Land und Leute tyrannisierenden Wikinger)\\", while Danish- oriented parts of the population of the islands presented an honorary sabre to him.Bricka, Dansk biografisk Lexikon, p. 536 Hammer returned from Austrian captivity in 1856 and took a seat in the Diet of Denmark. At the same time he also quit his public service and established a fishery business. In 1882, he acquired a sizeable sawmill in Sweden. It was located in G√§ll√∂, J√§mtland County. In 1885, his youngest son Sigurd came to G√§ll√∂ to help his father with the sawmill. Sigurd was an engineer, which came in handy when the sawmill would be expanded. Sigurd became the first in the Hammer family to acquire Swedish citizenship 1885. On 6 April 1889, Otto Hammer was promoted to the character of Commander. He had been ill for a long time so he and his wife returned from G√§ll√∂ to Copenhagen in early 1892. Otto Christian Hammer died 10 March 1892. He is buried in Holmens Cemetery in Copenhagen. His son Sigurd ran the sawmill until 1898 when it was sold. Sigurd moved shortly thereafter to Narvik in Norway to serve as Swedish consul.

Sionil Jos√©. According to Elmer A.

Sherds is the latest and last novel by Jos√©. According to The Atlantic National Correspondent James Fallows, the novel is dedicated to the author‚Äôs wife Teresita Jos√©.Fallows, James. Frankie Jos√©, The Atlantic, March 5, 2009, theatlantic.com The novel, which can be read in one sitting, was described by Li-an de la Cruz-Busto, a reporter for Sun.Star Davao as ‚Äúvery light but candid and insightful‚Äù,De la Cruz-Busto, Li-an.Busto: Instant fan, Choices, Sun.Star Davao, January 17, 2009, sunstar.com.ph a description that complements The Manila Times reporter Perry Gil S. Mallari‚Äôs calling Jos√©‚Äôs Sherds as an ‚Äúeasy read and a guaranteed page-turner‚Äù. A novel composed of twelve chapters with a \\"tight and palpable\\" narrative pacing, Sherds deals with topics related to \\"personal conscience, greed and the position of art\\" in social class struggle, thus serving as a cogitation on \\"what is wrong\\" with the Philippines as a nation. Jos√© wrote Sherds while he was in Japan. Description Like Jos√©‚Äôs other novels and stories such as the Rosales Saga, Sherds is another presentation and ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù by the author regarding ‚Äúclass conflict‚Äù and ‚Äúmalaise in society‚Äù in the Philippines through the use of ‚Äúnon-ideological terms‚Äù and sharing of his personal knowledge of the ‚Äútravails of the original tillers of the soil‚Äù and the dispossession of the land-tillers through the workings of the oligarchs. Employing a story- telling technique that begins with the ‚Äúending of the story, in medias res‚Äù, Jos√© narrates the tale of the discovery made by Peter Gregory Golangco (also known simply as PG Golangco), a pottery-and-ceramics artist, art professor, and aesthete, through the ‚ÄúPygmalion-like nurturing‚Äù of Guia Espiritu, Golangco‚Äôs student who has an elemental idea of art that is ‚Äúgrounded in the clay of oppressed people‚Äù of the Philippine countryside.Ordo√±ez, Elmer A. The Education of an Aesthete, The Other View, Opinion, The Manila Times (2001) January 19, 2008, manilatimes.net As an ‚Äúart and society‚Äù novel, the ninth chapter of Sherds showed Golangco as an aesthete questioned about his pose and position regarding social protest and his views about Pablo Picasso and Francisco Goya during an art exhibit. Golangco is a believer that ‚Äúart thrives on freedom‚Äù. However, a guest during the exhibition countered Golangco‚Äôs belief by saying that freedom is a ‚Äúpolitical condition‚Äù and that Golangco is a free person because of influence and the financial means to buy freedom, which is contrary to the so-called unpampered and unfree ‚Äúartists of the people‚Äù. Despite such \\"questioning\\", Golangco was applauded. Surprised, Golangco retreated to Caf√© Guernica, where he became ‚Äúalmost inconsolable‚Äù until Golangco was reassured by two female companions. According to Elmer A. Ordo√±ez, this scene in Sherds, is where Golangco‚Äôs ‚Äúeducation of the aesthete‚Äù started. The novel is full of symbolism. The primary example of such usage of symbolism is the clay used by PG Golangco in making pots. The clay symbolizes the oppressed villagers in Espiritu's barrio. As a symbolic element of the narrative, the clay has a fundamental function at the finale of the novel. Principal characters The major protagonists of the novel are Peter Gregory Golangco and Guia Espiritu. Golangco, a recognized art scholar abroad and a member of a hacienda-owning clan, was a student, artist, academic, and occasional ‚Äúsybaritic delights‚Äù indulger who decided to return to the Philippines. Golangco was oblivious to the fact that the Golangcos who stayed in the Philippines were the source of oppression, death, and poverty in the village in his hometown. The Golangco clan has a thriving business enterprise inside and outside the Philippines. The clan also participated in Philippine politics through elections and accepting appointments to positions at the ‚Äúhigher echelons‚Äù of the Philippine Government. PG Golangco had a ‚Äúlong- standing affair‚Äù with the dean of the university where he is teaching. The dean was a former student of Golangco. PG Golangco was unaware that the Golangcos were responsible for the demise of the parents of Guia Espiritu, Golangco's student. Guia Espiritu is Golangco‚Äôs student-assistant and ‚Äúprot√©g√© in grooming‚Äù. Espiritu described the Philippines as a country and society that remained semi-feudal and semi-colonial. Despite being the art student, Espiritu became Golangco‚Äôs ‚Äúeducator of the aesthete‚Äù. Espiritu introduced and mentored Golangco about the clay and pottery practices of her parents and in her village. Such introduction and mentoring lead Golangco to the ‚Äúaesthetics and pedagogy‚Äù of the oppressed and the dispossessed, and eventually to Golangco‚Äôs discovery of Espiritu‚Äôs origins. Golangco became intrigued by of the ‚Äústrange happenings in his own household and dealings‚Äù with Espiritu. References Category:Political novels Category:2007 novels Category:Novels by F.

Oil on canvas, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. Donated by Fuller. Collecting Always a keen anthropologist, Fuller began collecting on a large scale after the war, principally at auctions and from closing local museums. He married Estelle Cleverly in 1924 and with her continued to develop the collection and to build up a library of more than 20,000 volumes. He volunteered at the British Museum for a time and was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute. He refused throughout his life to deal in objects, and the only sale he made was in 1958, shortly before his death, when he sold more than 6,800 items from the Pacific to the Field Museum in Chicago for ¬£40,000 (the equivalent of ¬£ as of ). After his death in 1961 the rest of his collection was dispersed by his wife: the library was eventually purchased by the Bishop Museum in Hawaii. A. W. F. Fuller Collection at the Field Museum Throughout his life, Fuller acquired an extensive collection of Polynesian artifacts. Along with about 6,885 artifacts were purchased by the Field Museum from the Fullers. Additionally, about 300 more items would be donated to the museum by Fuller‚Äôs wife at a later time. This collection was formed over 62 years of Fullers lifetime when he was constantly purchasing and trading items in Britain. His collection was created during an era when Great Britain and Polynesia had a relationship that allowed the import of many Polynesian artifacts. Although Fuller never visited Polynesia, he acquired his items through purchase and gifts. For instance, sale in private homes, sale of museum inventories, auctions, and the shops of dealers are all places where he was able to purchase Polynesian objects. Sometimes he would trade an item that did not fit into his collection as well as the object that he was trading for. Additionally, events such as the missionary movements of London missionary and Melanesian missionary societies brought in many artifacts from the Polynesian world. Other items were acquired from the private collections of other military officials. He could also find amazing items in antique shops and he would be very excited if he found something that was worth a lot, but he paid a little for it because the shop owner did not understand the value of the object. From the adventures of missionaries and the army, various objects were brought back to Britain. The items he acquired included numerous variations of the same object that exemplified technological advancement. He compared and studied each object and he wanted as complete of a picture of the item as possible. Fuller was dedicated to collecting these items, but he never visited Polynesia. He was what one would call an armchair anthropologist because he never actually visited the sites, but acquired items that were so useful to the knowledge of Polynesian culture. In his older years he announced that he was looking for a museum or similar institution to house the collection. He was put into contact with the Field Museum officials through a friend, and in the 1950s he sold the collection. He was initially against selling the items, but eventually agreed upon a price, 40,000 pounds (today that would be about 834,600 pounds), that he felt would do well for his daughter after he passed on. In addition to acquisition of the collection the museum agreed to not split up the collection. Fuller wanted scientists to have as complete of a picture as possible for study and the acquisition of knowledge of old Polynesian societies. When the negotiations of price were being made, Fuller talked with Roland W. Force, a museum representative, and told the stories of how he acquired each item, the date, and any story that went along with the item. He also told what he could on its origins and how it was acquired. The archived recordings of their conversations are available through the museum.

David Kingery from Marion was interested in doing a single-handed race from England to Newport, Rhode Island and sailed alone to Bermuda as a qualifying voyage. This gave Kingery the concept of a race dedicated to cruising sailors and families on this route and he was able to obtain co-operation and sponsorship from the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club in Bermuda, the Beverly Yacht Club in Marion and the Blue Water Sailing Club. The first Marion‚ÄìBermuda Cruising Yacht Race was organized in 1977 for 104 boats. Unlike other offshore races, the Marion Bermuda race is a non- professional event for non-specialized and relatively inexpensive cruising yachts. The race defines itself as a \\"Corinthian\\" event, that is, one where the owners of the boats are part of the sailing crew and the crew is not paid to take part in the event. The race is run under Offshore Racing Rule handicap rules to allow a wide variety of boats to compete. At first, participants were only allowed to use celestial navigation to find their way to Bermuda. Today, race participants are allowed to use electronic navigation systems such as radio navigation or satellite navigation but there are handicapping bonuses and special prizes for completing the race under celestial navigation.

It premiered at the Feel Good Film Festival on August 14, 2010, and was released straight-to-DVD in 2011. Plot Henry Matthews (Uriah Shelton) lives in a small town in Alabama with his parents, William (Dash Mihok) and Lisa (Nicki Aycox). His father is a garage mechanic, but is also in the Reserves, while his mother is unemployed, but goes to group-therapy sessions for a drug addiction. She has been clean for one year and four months. Henry is a middle-schooler, and deals with bullies after school, forcing him to eventually take refuge in the Baptist Church where Henry meets Pastor John (Ruben Studdard). Pastor John takes a liking to Henry when they begin to play worship music on the church's piano, and discovers Henry is a very talented singer. Pastor John gives Henry a flyer for the Alabama Teen Star Quest, a singing competition in Birmingham. William's Reserve unit is activated and deployed to Afghanistan. While William is gone, Henry sends him songs to listen to, and to show off to his Marine buddies. While William is gone, Henry's mom cannot afford the mortgage on the house, and they move into Lisa's dad's trailer, without telling William. Lisa's dad hates the music Henry listens to and didn't agree with her marrying William. Henry skips school, but Lisa thinks he is gone. She begins to bike to her therapy session, but turns around. She walks to the neighbors and gets high, breaking her promise to William that she'd stay sober. Henry watches his mom get high out of the window, and unplugs his headphones from his radio. Lisa's dad returns and hits Henry for listening to his music and skipping school. He decides to leave and attend the competition. He tells his mom \\"bye,\\" but she is too high to understand. Henry hitchhikes to Birmingham to enter the singing competition. His dad comes home while he's gone, and finds the house empty, and his wife high, then runs to Birmingham where he finds Henry and performs with him in the competition. Henry gets far in the competition, and is covered on the news, where Lisa's dad sees him. Lisa and her dad go to Birmingham and find Henry. Lisa's father tells the competition officials that he hasn't had a parent with him the entire time. This confuses Henry, who is told his father died three months earlier. Henry looks at his dad, who says no one else can see him. His dad was killed by an Afghan woman back when he was deployed, but William's spirit was with Henry the whole time. Henry decides to drop out of the competition because his dad isn't there. William's spirit then visits his friend for his unit. The friend's remote breaks on the channel talking about Henry and reads a letter William gave him. The letter tells him to help Henry in the competition if he ever dies. Back at the competition Henry can't sing because his dad is gone. The judges eliminate him but one of the other singers quits and let Henry have his place. Together Henry and William's friend win the competition and are offered a chance to meet with a record company in Los Angeles.

The church's senior pastor, Ch√© Ahn, and his son, Gabe Ahn, were shown a special screening of the film. Gabe was quoted as saying, \\"What I liked so much about this film is that it centered on family relationships, but at the same time encourages us to dream big.\\" Lifted was the first film made under Alabama's new film incentive program. Reception Reviewer Ted Grande Falcone on his website reviewed the film positively, saying that, \\"Lifted reminds us of the importance of unconditional love in the family unit and of pursuing dreams. Also, the film serves as a heartfelt tribute to the tremendous sacrifices all our servicemen and women and their families make every day. From a political standpoint, it successfully navigates the narrow road of depicting war as tragedy but warriors as vital heroes.\\" The director dedicated the film \\"to all of our fallen heroes\\".

No.1160 2011 Early responses by Anime News Network praised the pilot, stating nostalgic Digimon fans would enjoy it based on its new approach to power-ups within the main cast and compared it to the highly acclaimed mecha series Gurren Lagann despite suffering from cliches often seen in other anime. Voice actor Kyle Hebert said he enjoyed working in the English dub of the series as his two characters, Dorulumon and Balistamon, offered diverse characterization. Fellow actor Ben Diskin shared similar feelings, commenting he had been a fan of Fusion ever since its Japanese premiere and thus was glad to be voicing both Shoutmon and Cutemon, another pair of characters whose personalities differ greatly. General critical reception has also been positive. Mediaverum enjoyed the early episodes from Fusion and recommended it to fans of both the first two Digimon Adventure series. While noting the series was aimed at a young audience, DVDCorner wrote that the series still had deep themes which might attract older viewers despite its flaws. ICv2 recommended the series for a young audience when checking the English DVDs. CulturedVultures left it up to the viewers to watch it or not, also recommending it to an audience that has knowledge of the franchise, while Metro stated it retained the appeal of its predecessors which overshadowed the famous Pok√©mon back in the 1990s. DVDTalk found mixed feelings when reviewing Fusion. While he lamented the series' focus on Digimons rather than humans, he still praised the show for its animation and recommended it to fans of the series. Capsule Monster commented that despite the apparent attempts of the series to expand marketing, Fusion offers an appealing story, as rather than focusing on friendship, it also contains dark themes rarely seen in children's shows which might attract other audiences.

It was a single- track line in metre gauge, operating from 1883 to 1931. The railway was known locally in Maltese as il-vapur tal-art (the land ship).  History  Digging the railway tunnel between Valletta and Floriana, April 1882 Old Valletta Railway Station (Reception), 1890s The first proposal to build a railway in Malta was made in 1870 by J. S. Tucker. The main reason was to connect the capital Valletta with the former capital Mdina so the journey time between the two cities would be reduced from 3 hours to less than half an hour. A narrow- gauge railway system designed by John Barraclough Fell was initially proposed. In 1879, this was dropped in favour of a design by the engineering firm of Wells-Owen & Elwes, London. In 1880, the newspaper The Malta Standard reported that \\"in a short space of time, the inhabitants of these Islands may be able to boast of possessing a railway\\", and that the line was to be open by the end of 1881. There were some problems with the acquisition of land to build the railway, so construction took longer than expected. The line was opened on 28 February 1883 at 3pm, when the first train left Valletta and arrived at Mdina after about 25 minutes. Finances of the railway always proved critical. On 1 April 1890 the first proprietor, the Malta Railway Company Ltd., went bankrupt and the railway stopped running. As a result of this the government took over the railway, invested in its infrastructure and reopened traffic on 25 January 1892. From 1895 on an extension of the line was under work aiming for the barracks at Mtarfa behind the historic city of Mdina. This extension was opened for traffic in 1900. The introduction of buses contributed to the decline of the Malta Railway. In 1903 a company was founded which ran tramways on Malta from 1905 on, partly parallel to the railway line, and this competition had a negative effect on the railway's finances. The first buses were introduced in 1905 and became popular in the 1920s. This contributed to the decline of both the railway as well as the tramway. The tram company closed in 1929, while the railway line stopped operating on 31 March 1931. During the siege of Malta in World War II, the railway tunnel running under the fortifications of Valletta was used as an air-raid-shelter. In 1940, Mussolini proclaimed that an Italian air raid destroyed the Maltese railway system, even though the railway had been closed for nine years. Over the years, long stretches of the former railway line were surfaced with tarmac and converted into roads. Some of the railway buildings are still in existence.  Line  The line connected Valletta and Mdina and a number of settlements in between. The first two stations, Valletta and Floriana, were underground. The Line extended over 11.1 km / 7 m, climbing 150 meters / 500 feet at a maximum of 25 Per mil. The line crossed roads by 18 level crossings of which 14 were staffed. The roads were chained off when a train was approaching. Originally the line was constructed with rails of 42 pounds per foot and replaced when the government took over the railway in 1890 by those of 60 pound per foot to allow heavier locomotives to run on the line.  Vehicles = Locomotives  During its lifetime the railway had only 10 locomotives. These were built by Manning Wardle & Co. Ltd., Leeds, Black, Hawthorn & Co Ltd., Gateshead, and Beyer, Peacock & Co. Ltd., Manchester. Most of them were 2-6-2 and 2-6-4 engines. They were painted in olive on black frames. None of them are preserved.  Carriages  The carriages were wooden on iron frames. First and third class was provided. The seats were parallel to the line on both sides of an aisle. Originally illuminated by candles, this was changed to electricity, powered by batteries, in 1900. When the railway stopped running, 34 carriages were in use. One third-class carriage is preserved, was restored and placed beside the former station building of Birkirkara but, as of 2014, is now rather dilapidated. It is now being renovated and will be repositioned near the original location.  Traffic  Museum Station (Birchircara), 1910s A train usually consisted of five carriages, while trains running over the maximal climb before Notabile had only four. After more powerful engines were used, trains up to 12 carriages became possible. During World War I, even longer trains were run using two locomotives. Travelling time inland (that is, uphill) was 35 minutes; downhill, in the direction of Valletta, 30 minutes. Initially quite a busy timetable was in use with 13 pairs of trains running the whole of the line and an additional two or three pairs between Valletta and Attard, Valletta and Birkirkara and Valletta and ƒ¶amrun.  Present day = Remains of the Malta Railway  The only surviving carriage of the Malta Railway in storage at the Birkirkara Civil Centre in 2015, shortly before being restoredCarabott, Sarah (1 September 2016). Malta's only surviving train carriage to get funds for restoration. Times of Malta. Archived from the original on 2 September 2016. Various parts of the railway still exist to this day, most notably the stations at Birkirkara and Mdina, along with various bridges and tunnels. Various roads which were built instead of the railway retain names such as Railway Road in Santa Venera and Railway Street in Mtarfa. The station at Valletta was damaged during World War II and was demolished in the 1960s to make way for Freedom Square. Its site is now occupied by the Parliament House. The railway tunnel adjacent to the station was used as a garage (Yellow Garage), but it was closed in 2011 as part of the City Gate Project. The modern structures within the tunnel have since been demolished, restoring it to its original state. Works are also being made on the bridge near the tunnel. The ticket office at Floriana still exists. A former railway tunnel under St Philip's Gardens was reopened in 2011 and has been open for visitors on various occasions since then. Two original luggage trolleys were found within the tunnel, but in a very dilapidated state. The bridge which linked the tunnel with the rest of the line still exists, although it is overgrown. The ƒ¶amrun station is now used as the headquarters of the 1st Hamrun Scout Group. The former station in Birkirkara is currently used as a child care centre, but plans are being made to turn it into a museum known as the Birkirkara Historical Malta Railway Museum. The garden near the station, ƒ†nien l-Istazzjon (Station Garden), contains the only surviving carriage of the railway, although it is in a rather dilapidated state. When the station is converted into a museum, the garden will also be refurbished, and the carriage will be restored and repositioned. At the beginning of April 2017 the carriage has been taken to renovate. On the place where there was Attard Station is now known as Gnien L-Stazzjoni, which is close to San Anton Gardens. In Attard there is the Malta Railway Museum, a small private museum, which is open to the public on demand, that was opened in 1998. It shows photographs, documents and other memorabilia of the railway, in addition to models of eight segments of the line reconstructed in a ratio 1:148 by Nicholas Azzopardi between 1981 and 1985. The former Museum Station near Mdina was converted into the Stazzjon Restaurant in 1986. The restaurant also contained many railway-related photos and a model locomotive. It closed down in 2011. But in 2016 it was reopened and is known as L-Istazzjon.

Gap Yah is a comedy sketch that gained widespread popularity and press coverage, especially in the United Kingdom, after being published on the video-sharing site YouTube in February 2010. It was created and performed by Oxford University graduate Matt Lacey of sketch comedy theatre troupe The Unexpected Items. The video was produced and directed by VM Productions and The Unexpected Items. The video became a viral hit, with 660,000 views in its first month and around 50,000 views a day in late March 2010. As of September 2018, the original video has been viewed over 6.3 million times. The video depicts a student named Orlando describing to his friend Tarquin several of his experiences and encounters during a gap year in Tanzania, Peru and Burma, all of which resulted in him vomiting‚Äîor \\"chundering\\"‚Äîeverywhere. The video is a spoof of the British upper-middle-class ex-public school students (using distinctively drawn-out vowels)‚Äîcommonly known as rahs‚Äîwho boast about their experiences, typically in the third world, prior to attending university. The sketch has resulted in the term being increasingly used in schools and universities across the United Kingdom. An online following has developed, with tribute Facebook pages as well as several remixed versions of the video having been created by others. Phrases from the video have become cultural memes, with the phrase \\"...and then I just chundered everywhere\\" being added to satirise election posters of Conservative Party leader and former UK prime minister David Cameron as well as events such as the eruption of the Icelandic Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano. Gap Yah is described by its creator as follows: Lacey also states that \\"depressingly, there are a lot of these people and I even have elements of them myself.\\" A sequel to the sketch, entitled Gap Yah 2: Afterparty was released on 26 April 2010, it was also highly successful, reaching over 1.4 million views by September 2018. It featured Orlando, again chatting to his friend Tarquin on his mobile, while he and his friend Pandora place posters around a town to advertise a fund-raising event for \\"Haiti, in Africa\\".

William Beveridge said of him: \\"He was a restless, inventive, constructive spirit, part author of at least three large living movements; charity organisation, working men's clubs, and garden cities\\".William Beveridge, Voluntary Action. A Report on the Methods of Social Advance (George Allen & Unwin, 1948), p. 170. He was the son of Isaac Solly, a merchant in the Baltic trade. He became a Chartist. He supported many Radical causes, such as universal suffrage, free education, repeal of the Corn Laws, co-operatives, anti-slavery, and early closing for shops and Sunday opening for museums. In the early 1860s he took a leading part in founding working men's clubs, though as a teetotaller he did not want them to sell alcohol. In June 1868 Solly's paper, titled ‚ÄòHow to deal with the Unemployed Poor of London and with its ‚ÄúRoughs‚Äù and Criminal Classes‚Äô was read at a meeting of the Society of Arts, chaired by the Bishop of London, A. C. Tait.Charles Loch Mowat, The Charity Organisation Society. 1869‚Äì1913 (Methuen, 1961), p. 15. This led to plans for the Charity Organization Society. In 1884 Solly founded the Society for the Promotion of Industrial Villages. Although this was a failure, it led to Sir Ebenezer Howard's Garden City movement. Solly died of a brain haemorrhage in 1903. B. T. Hall, the secretary of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union, wrote a year later: \\"If the work that the Clubs do, if their influence on personal character and their contribution to the sum total of human happiness be correctly appreciated...then shall the investigator reckon Henry Solly amongst the constructive statesmen of our time\\".J. H. Wicksteed, Working Men's Social Clubs (1904), p. 214. He spent the first half of his adult life as a Unitarian minister, and after he left the profession, continued to worship at Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. He had four daughters, one of whom married Philip Wicksteed, and one son, who wrote the biography of Henry Morley. One of his students, Anna Evans, who stayed with his family later achieved fame under the pen name \\"Allen Raine\\".

Its borders are Annapolis Road on the east, the Baltimore city/county line to the south, a CSX/MARC Railroad line to the west, and the same railroad line to the north. History The communities of Westport, Mount Winans, and Lakeland are some of the oldest in Baltimore City. As early as 1675, settlers established small farms in the area. In July 1732, Dr. Charles Carroll of Annapolis was granted a patent out of the Land Office of Maryland for property he named \\"Georgia.\\" This grant had been surveyed for him in November 1731. Though the survey recited 2360 acres, Georgia was later found to contain 2481.9 acres. He would call his grant the \\"Georgia Plantation.\\" See history and a copy of \\"Georgia Plantation Map at Mount Clare Museum House. Carroll's Georgia Plantation covered the present-day neighborhoods of Westport, Mount Winans, Morrell Park, and Violetville. Carroll deeded the Westport tracts over to the Baltimore Iron Works Company, a partnership of which he was managing partner and included, among other partners, his distant cousins Daniel Carroll of Duddington and Charles Carroll of Annapolis, who was then Attorney General of Provincial Maryland and who would in 1737 become the father of Charles Carroll of Carrollton. With its large furnace near the mouth of the Gwynns Falls, the Baltimore Iron Works smelted and forged iron ore dug from pits along the old Annapolis Road and the Westport waterfront, where ships received the excavated loads. A small community of two-story brick homes grew up near the pits on old Annapolis Road to house the workers employed there and their families. The community was dubbed \\"Minersville\\" (in the area now known as Lakeland). In 1836, Harmon‚Äôs Three-Cent Bridge, a two hundred foot wooden span, carried Annapolis Road across the Gwynns Falls towards the center City. Shortly afterwards, a number of shoreline resorts opened on the southern banks of Middle Branch. Demographics Race/Ethnicity The race and ethnicity distribution of Westport/Mt. Winans/Lakeland compared to Baltimore City overall (2010). Westport/Mt.

R. James, originally published in 1895. It was later collected in his 1904 book Ghost Stories of an Antiquary. Plot summary The tale tells the story of Stephen Elliott, a young orphan boy, who is sent to stay with his much older cousin, Mr Abney, at a remote country mansion, Aswarby Hall, in Lincolnshire. His cousin is a reclusive alchemist obsessed with making himself immortal. Stephen is repeatedly troubled by visions of a young gypsy girl and a travelling Italian boy with their hearts missing. Adaptations The story was first adapted for television by ABC and broadcast by ITV on 5 March 1966 as an episode of the Mystery and Imagination series. However, no archive recordings of this episode are known to exist. \\"Lost Hearts\\" was adapted by Robin Chapman in 1973 as part of the BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas strand, directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark. The shortest of the adaptations, it was first broadcast on Christmas Day 1973 at 11:35 pm. It starred Simon Gipps-Kent as Stephen and Joseph O'Conor as the cousin. The adaptation is noted for the distinctive hurdy-gurdy music that accompanies appearances of the two ghostly children. Ralph Vaughan Williams's English Folk Song Suite is also featured. In 2018, a third film adaptation of the short story was released by Severn Film Productions in association with Action Image Productions, co-written by Lynn Davies and directed by Max Van De Banks. The production features Nicholas Amer as Mr Abney, Louis Newton as Stephen Elliott, Margaret Baldwin as Mrs Bunch, Mark Llewellin as Mr Parks and Eleanor Catherine Smart as Emily. The film was shot on location at Eastnor Castle and Hellens Manor in Herefordshire and the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Steam Railway. The story is updated to the 1940s (and later 1953) when, following the death of Stephen's parents, the young boy has been evacuated to the countryside during World War II. This production is unusual in that the film was shot in two parts, with the main elements being filmed in 2005 and the beginning and end of the film in 2016, with Louis Newton returning as Stephen, now a young man recounting to his bride-to-be the story of what happened ten years earlier. The film was entered in The Bristol International Film Festival and received a nomination at the Moving Pictures Festival in Nieuwmoer, Belgium in 2018.

He was an All-American quarterback for the University of Chicago and captain of the 1898 and 1899 Chicago Maroons football teams. He later moved to Albion, Michigan where he was the publisher of the Albion Evening Recorder from 1904 to 1939. He also coached the Albion College football team from 1904 to 1920. Biography=Early years Kennedy was born in Woodburn, Iowa, in approximately 1873. He played high school football at Villisca, Iowa. After graduating from high school, Kennedy attended Tarkio College in Tarkio, Missouri, where he again played football. University of Chicago Kennedy enrolled at the University of Chicago where he played football for head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg from 1896 to 1899. He also competed for Chicago in baseball and track. Kennedy was five feet, nine inches tall and weighed 196 pounds. He began his football career as a tackle, but he was moved to the halfback position in 1897, playing in the same backfield as College Football Hall of Fame inductee, Clarence Herschberger. At the end of the 1897 season, his teammates elected him as the captain of the 1898 Chicago Maroons football team. At the time of his election as team captain, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"In guarding the men who carry the ball and in breaking up the interference of the opposing team he is unsurpassed in the West, and is a hard man to stop when he himself advances the ball.\\" For the 1898 and 1899 seasons, Kennedy was moved to the quarterback position. In November 1898, questions were raised as to Kennedy's eligibility to play college football. An individual formerly associated with Chicago football, who was then coaching in Iowa, wrote a letter to the University of Chicago reporting that Kennedy's mother had informed him that her son was receiving $500 a year to play football at Chicago. Several additional letters were received, raising questions about Kennedy's past, including his baseball record. The University of Chicago concluded that Kennedy was eligible, and he was selected by Walter Camp as a second-team All-American quarterback in 1898. In February 1899, Caspar Whitney renewed the controversy over Kennedy's eligibility in an article published in Harper's Weekly. Whitney had secured a copy of the Western Conference rules and argued that Kennedy, having played college football at Tarkio College for at least one season, was not eligible to play a fourth year of varsity football for Chicago. Despite the questions over his eligibility, Kennedy (at age 26) was permitted to return in 1899 as Chicago's starting quarterback. He was also chosen to be Chicago's captain for a second time in 1899. Several schools, including Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin boycotted Chicago in 1899, protesting Chicago's use of players with dubious eligibility. In 1929, a columnist in the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote that the undefeated 1899 team was considered one of the two greatest Chicago football teams of all time. The 1899 Chicago Maroons defeated Notre Dame (23-0), Cornell (17-6), Purdue (44-0), Northwestern (76-0), Minnesota (29-0), and Brown (17-6), and played to ties against Iowa (5-5) and Penn (5-5). Because of the boycott of Chicago, the 1899 season ended with uncertainty as to whether Chicago or Wisconsin had fielded the best team in the West. Wisconsin agreed to a post-season championship game against Chicago. The game, played on December 9, 1899, was Kennedy's last game for Chicago. Chicago won the game 17-0, and Kennedy later described the game as his \\"greatest thrill in football.\\" The game matched the punting skills of Wisconsin's Pat O'Dea against Kennedy's punting. Kennedy was forced to punt from Chicago's ten-yard line, and Kennedy kicked the ball as he was being thrown to the ground by Wisconsin end Eddie Cochems. The kick proved to be the longest punt of Kennedy's career. At the end of the 1899 season, he was selected as a first- team All-American by the Philadelphia Inquirer. He was selected as an All- Western player at either halfback or quarterback three straight years from 1897 to 1899. Later years After graduating from Chicago, Kennedy went into the newspaper business. He began his newspaper career as a football writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune in 1900. In 1904, Kennedy moved to Albion, Michigan, where he worked as both a newspaperman and football coach. He was the publisher of the Albion Evening Recorder from 1904 to 1939. He was also the head football coach at Albion College from 1904 to 1920, leading the team to a 51-29-8 record (.625 winning percentage) and four championships. Kennedy died in Albion, Michigan in 1954 at age 79.

This coincides with the Korean title, which literally means \\"traveler\\" or \\"tourist\\". In the orphanage, she tries to come to grips with the abandonment by her father and insecurities about a possible adoption. She gradually makes friendships, although she retains the belief that her father will return to take her back, and struggles (sometimes violently) not to adjust to her surroundings. In the end, Jin-hee is adopted by French parents who are eagerly waiting for her at an airport to meet their new child.

She was of 75 tons (bm) and carried eight 4-pounder guns. There was also a cutter Queen Charlotte that was present at the taking of Saint Lucia in May 1796 by British forces under Sir Hugh Christian and Sir Ralph Abercrombie. First contract On her first contract Queen Charlotte may initially have been under the command of Lieutenant John Drew, on the Newfoundland Station.Newfoundland squadrons (1801-1805) On 17 July 1803 , and Queen Charlotte captured Caroline. Then on 28 July, the same three vessels recaptured from the French the brig Mercure, which apparently was British-built and once called Mercury. In November Queen Charlotte was under the command of Lieutenant John G.M.B. McKillop. In late 1804, Vice-Admiral Erasmus Gower, then Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, sent Queen Charlotte, under Lieutenant Isaac H. Morrison, to Labrador to investigate reports of an influx of American fishing boats. As a result of the report, the Admiralty decided to station a sloop in the fishing waters to chase off the Americans.Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage In October Morrison transferred to command the newly-launched schooner , which was, however, a smaller vessel. His replacement in 1805 was Lieutenant John Brown. Second contract On 26 October 1807 Tsar Alexander I of Russia declared war on Great Britain. The official news did not arrive in the United Kingdom until 2 December, at which time the British declared an embargo on all Russian vessels in British ports. Queen Charlotte was one of some 70 vessels that shared in the seizure of the 44-gun Russian frigate Speshnoy (Speshnyy), then in Portsmouth harbour. The British seized the Russian storeship Wilhelmina at the same time. Later, Queen Charlotte was under master Mr Joseph Thomas when on 22 July 1810 she recaptured William. Then on 29 August near Alderney Queen Charlotte encountered a French vessel of sixteen 12-pounder guns. After a fight of an hour and a half, the French sailed away. Queen Charlotte had one man killed and 14 wounded out of her total complement of 27, including her master and a passenger. One or more of the wounded may have died afterwards.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, pp.247-9. The French vessel was believed to have been the former British revenue cutter Swan, captured two years earlier off Portland, and to have had a crew of 80 to 100 men. James reports the French vessel as having sixteen 6-pounders and a crew of 120.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.340-1. The passenger was a Mr P.A. Mulgrave, who had been employed in establishing a telegraph between Jersey and the British fleet of Cherbourg. He was wounded above the eye while firing a musket but remained on deck, helping with ammunition, during the whole fight. Seven years earlier master J. Thomas had been second in command of the hired armed cutter Princess Augusta during a less bloody but equally lop-sided and ultimately equally successful action.Publications of the Navy Records Society, Volume 4, Index of Naval Officers, p.161. Later reports have Queen Charlotte conveying vessels between Portsmouth and the Channel Islands. On 15 June 1812 Queen Charlotte was in company with the hired armed lugger Sandwich when Sandwich captured the French privateer Courageux. Courageux was armed with two guns and carried a crew of 24 men. She was four days out of Brehat and had not captured anything.

Somerville had joined the Royal Scots Greys regiment of the British Army in December 1831. In May 1832, during the disturbances caused by the Reform Bill, Somerville wrote to a newspaper claiming that the army would protect property but would not stop citizens exercising their rights and would not support a military government. Officers in the army wanted to punish him but because he had not broken the law they ordered him at riding school to ride an unruly horse. When he dismounted and refused to remount he was court-martialled and punished with 100 lashes. He was supported by newspapers and MPs as they believed he had been punished for his political opinions. The court of inquiry acquitted his commanding officer but Somerville's questioning of the officers aroused suspicions that he had been flogged for the letter. He purchased his discharge from the army after a subscription was raised. Richard Cobden persuaded Somerville to join the Anti- Corn Law League in August 1842. He promoted free trade in rural areas where protectionism was in the ascendant. He recorded what he found and Friedrich Engels quoted him in his The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845). These were later published in three volumes under the title Whistler at the Plough (1852‚Äì53). However he later fell out with Cobden due to his pacifism which he considered as weakening Britain. Somerville moved to Canada with his family in 1858. He was suffering serious financial problems and was also thoroughly disenchanted with Cobden and his pacifist views. His wife died shortly after their arrival in Canada. Although they were living in poverty, Somerville contributed to Canadian journalism in a number of ways. His Narrative of the Fenian Invasion of Canada was an important piece of writing. He wrote for two versions of the newspaper Canadian Illustrated News. Supposedly about 5000 pages of memoirs which have never been found were written in his last years. He ended his years residing in a woodshed and writing while living in abject poverty.

Early life and education  Andrew Morrison was born on 5 June 1919 in Georgetown, British Guiana. He attended high school at St. Stanislaus College and attended a Jesuit institution for college. He studied accounting, and following graduation, he returned to Georgetown to work at an accounting firm.  Career  Morrison joined the Society of Jesus in 1949 at the age of 30, and was sent to Great Britain to study for the priesthood, as Guyana is a member of the Jesuits' British Province. He was ordained a priest on 31 July 1957, the feast day of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus. He was sent back to British Guiana (independent Guyana since 1966) and served as youth chaplain of the Green Light Organisation, a Catholic social ministry. During this time, he founded the well-known Camp Kayuka on the Linden-Soesdyke Highway. In 1972, Morrison was appointed Vicar General of the Diocese of Georgetown, a position he held for four years. In July 1976, Morrison was appointed Editor of the Catholic Standard, the newspaper of the Diocese of Georgetown and the only religious newspaper in Guyana. Fr Morrison's first major public episode, in view of the international community at large, was his coverage of the Jim Jones led mass suicide-massacre, which took place in 1978 in Guyana. A year later, an assassination attempt upon his life failed because a fellow Jesuit was mistaken for Fr Morrison; Fr Darke was brutally murdered. Such attempts to frustrate Fr Morrison's quest for justice and rights had absolutely no effect upon him. He publicly exposed a plot by members of the governing regime to assassinate an opposition Guyanese politician (Rodney) in the paper he headed, the Catholic Standard. Amidst awards and honours from the international community he lamented the state of his countrymen and further hardships experienced by the certain fellow Jesuit elements, supporters of his cause. Fr Connors was deported from Guyana. At the turn of the 21st century, two noted American 'hitmen' appeared in the country apparently targeting Morrison, but to no avail. Nevertheless, Fr Morrison would live to see the downfall of oppression in Guyana and a complete return to democracy; largely due to his supremely brave, nevertheless non-political, efforts. This man whom a former national leader had described as a \\"cassocked obscenity\\" died peacefully in his home country of Guyana on 27 January 2004, and was buried in the Sacred Heart Church in Georgetown amidst many tears and emotional tributes. He certainly lives on in the hearts of many as the man described by Fredrick Kissoon, Ricky Singh and Hugh O'Shaughnessy as a 'Symbol of courage' and one who went about living serenely amidst insecurity; an insecurity that had his co workers quite nervous but was of no concern to him. Morrison died in his Georgetown home on 26 January 2004, at the age of 84.

Her theories about P. cryptocides have not been duplicated by researchers, and a clinical trial of her therapy did not show any efficacy in the treatment of cancer. The American Cancer Society, which did not support Livingston's treatment protocol for cancer, categorically denied her theory of cancer origins. Life Virginia Livingston was born Virginia Wuerthele in Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1906. Both her father and grandfather were physicians and she also pursued a degree in medicine. Prior to attending medical school, Livingston earned three BA degrees in English, history, and economics from Vassar College. She then attended New York University, Bellevue Medical College and in 1936, received her degree in medicine. She was one of four women in her graduating class. Shortly after graduation, Livingston became the first female resident physician at a New York hospital where she was assigned to treat prostitutes infected with venereal diseases. While there, Livingston became interested in the study of tuberculosis and leprosy, and later scleroderma, a disease affecting the tissues and skin. After studying scleroderma tissues with the darkfield microscope, she claimed to find an acid-fast organism that consistently appeared in her slides. Thinking that scleroderma had some characteristics that were like cancer, Livingston then began studying malignant tissues and subsequently claimed to find evidence of acid-fast organisms in every sample. It was this early research that prompted the young physician to devote her career to the study of a specific microorganism involved in cancer. Early research In 1946, Livingston published a paper in which she stated she had established that a bacterium was a causative agent in scleroderma. In 1947, she cultured a mycobacteria-like organism in human cancer and, according to her peer-reviewed paper, fulfilled Koch's postulates establishing an apparent cause and effect. In 1949, Livingston was named chief of the Rutgers-Presbyterian Hospital Laboratory for Proliferative Diseases in New Jersey where she continued her cancer research. It was during this time that Livingston formed a lifetime association with Dr. Eleanor Alexander-Jackson of Cornell University. Jackson's specialty was the study of mycobacteria and particularly, the species responsible for tuberculosis. Jackson had developed specific culture media for growing the microbe and a technique for observing it known as the \\"triple stain\\" because she felt this microbe wasn't amenable to conventional modes of culturing and microscopy. Livingston and Jackson also collaborated on work on the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) at Lederle Laboratories. Livingston claimed that when RSV cultures were passed through special filters designed to hold back all but the smallest virus particles, she was able to grow bacteria; this was considered a controversial claim since bacteria are considerably larger than viruses and should not exist in filtered RSV serum. After healthy animals were exposed to the Rous bacterial filtrates, Livingston and Jackson claimed that cancerous lesions developed. This finding led to speculation that such bacteria could be transmitted from poultry to humans and this became a primary reason Livingston ordered her cancer patients to not eat poultry while they underwent her treatment. Scientists have since rejected Livingston's findings, arguing there is no evidence supporting her claim. In 1956, Livingston published a paper suggesting a causative bacterium in Wilson's disease. In 1965, she reported isolation of a variably acid-fast mycobacterium in patients with myocardial vascular disease. During this time, she also began a small test trial of anti-bacterial vaccines made from the body fluids of cancer patients and reported moderate success. Between the years 1965-1968, Livingston received Fleet Foundation and Kerr Grants, and continued her investigation into a bacterial cause of human cancer. She also published a paper describing the presence of a substance identified as Actinomycin-D which she said could damage chromosomes and promote cancer. In 1969, Livingston and her husband Afton Munk Livingston, established the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic in San Diego, California, and began formally treating cancer patients. The therapeutic program included autogenous vaccine made from killed bacteria derived from body fluids; a low sodium diet consisting of organic foods, fruits and vegetables high in a substance Livingston called \\"abscisic acid\\"; immune enhancing vaccines (gamma globulin, BCG) and antibiotics. Livingston prescribed antibiotics after cross testing them with patients' cultures to see which had the most antibacterial activity. Livingston also recommended that patients not consume poultry products based on her earlier research. After her husband's death, she married Owen Webster Wheeler, one of the first patients she claims to have successfully treated for head and neck cancer. Shortly after, the clinic was renamed the Livingston-Wheeler clinic. In 1970, Livingston officially named her cancer organism Progenitor cryptocides, and presented her findings to the New York Academy of Sciences. According to her biography, Progenitor was a pseudonym meaning \\"ancestral\\" and the name was chosen because Livingston believed the microbe existed as early as the Precambrian era, and it was an endogenous component of life itself. The name \\"cryptocides\\" was a Greek and Latin word which meant \\"hidden killer\\". The microbe was classified under the order Actinomycetales. Livingston described Progenitor as an intermittently acid-fast mycobacterium that displayed highly variable growth cycles. According to Livingston the microbe was pleomorphic, and had cell wall-deficient and filter-passing forms resembling viruses, with the ability to adopt a variety of shapes including spindles, rods and cocci. 1974-1990 In 1974, Livingston published a paper which described her isolation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from cancer bacteria. She then advanced one of her central hypotheses. Livingston theorized that hCG is both a component of human cancer, but also innately involved in embryonic growth and fetal survival. She wrote that hCG is saturated in the placenta, and blocks the mothers‚Äô antibodies from attacking the fetus, partly made of foreign DNA (and not recognized by host immunity). By the same token, hCG performs a similar function in cancer, conferring protection to malignant tissues. Livingston believed that after Progenitor hybridizes with cancer cells, it imparts an ability for them to produce hCG in a manner similar to that of the developing fetus. Based on this duality of function, Livingston called hCG ‚Äúthe hormone of life and the hormone of death‚Äù. She also stipulated that vaccines which target hCG-producing bacteria could also halt the progression of cancer. And she claimed that abscisic acid could also neutralize hCG. Controversy Though some bacteria have been associated with cancer (for instance H. pylori has been associated with stomach cancer) Livingston's postulated relationship between cancer and P. cryptocides was never proven in several follow up studies conducted by independent investigators. Researchers confirmed that bacteria provided by Livingston produced hCG, but several other studies demonstrated that numerous bacteria in both cancer patients and healthy individuals also produced the substance. Occurring before the existence of techniques to analyze DNA, Livingston and other investigators' ability to differentiate bacteria based on morphology and chemical characteristics was limited. However, even given technological limitations at the time, Livingston's classification methods were described as full of \\"remarkable errors\\", attributing characteristics to Actinomycetales (the order Livingston believed P. cryptocides belonged to) shared by no other members of the order. Some evidence supports P. cryptocides is the result of a mistaken identification of a Staphylococcus strain of bacteria and later studies of the samples provided by Livingston proved to be Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. The American Cancer Society (ACS) did not support Livingston's treatment protocol for cancer, and has categorically denied her theory of the cancer bacterium P. cryptocides the primary cause of human cancer. The ACS also challenged the efficacy of Livingston's autogenous vaccine and concluded in its report that there was no corroboration of either P. cryptocides or the efficacy of her autologous vaccine. Since Livingston hadn't stocked earlier cultures of her alleged microbe, it is not possible to decipher precisely what those cultures contained. Clinical testing A case- control study using self-selected, matched but not randomized groups with late stage cancer compared survival and quality of life between cancer patients receiving conventional treatment and those undergoing the Livingston-Wheeler therapy. The results were reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1991, and found no differences in survival among patients whether treated conventionally, or via Livingston's treatment. The NEJM report also stated that when comparing the two groups, the \\"quality of life were consistently better among conventionally treated patients from enrollment on\\". Based on this trial, the ACS deemed Livingston's cancer therapy without efficacy, and considered it an \\"unproven therapy\\". While both groups of patients in the trial deteriorated at equal rates, patients in the Livingston-treated group were reported to have had a \\"poorer quality of life\\" at the start of the trial. The study's lead investigator, Barrie Cassileth, acknowledged that \\"the University of Pennsylvania patients had a significantly better quality of life at all times, including enrollment\\" and that, quality of life \\"was different at base line\\", with Livingston's patients rated worse. Patients in both treatment arms also received conventional therapies in addition to Livingston's therapy. Livingston's patients also received BCG during the trial ---an FDA-approved cancer adjuvant which has been found effective for several cancers, including those of the bladder and colon. At the study's conclusion, Barrie Cassileth commented: \\"This study...involved only patients with diagnoses and stages of disease for which there is no effective conventional treatment. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to patients with less advanced stages of disease or to other treatment regimens.\\" Cassileth also said, her study group \\"hypothesized that survival time would not differ between the two groups on the basis of the assumption that the unproved remedy would be no more effective with end-stage disease than conventional care, itself largely ineffective\\". Death Shortly after speaking before an Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) hearing on alternative cancer therapies and attending her 60th reunion at Vassar College in 1990, Livingston accompanied her daughter Julie Anne Wagner on a European trip. She developed chest pains while visiting the Greek islands and then succumbed to heart failure in Athens on June 30, before being transported to a Paris Hospital.

The station was on the Devizes branch line, between Devizes station and the Reading- Taunton line.  Opening  The station, originally named Pans Lane Bridge Halt, opened on 4 March 1929 for the residents of south Devizes, but more importantly for the nearby Roundway Hospital, during a time when the Great Western Railway was increasing the number of halts in the South West. The station name was simplified to Pans Lane Halt later in 1929. After completion of the eastern section of track, the Devizes line was a main line from London to Bristol. However, the line lost out to competition and reverted to branch line status, although it was used as a back-up line to the West Country in case of emergency.  Closure  Much like Devizes station, Pans Lane Halt suffered from reduced traffic after the completion of the Stert and Westbury Railway line, which by-passed Devizes to shorten the London to Bristol journey by 5 miles. Pans Lane Halt station was closed on 18 April 1966 and the entire Devizes Branch Line in the same year under the Beeching cuts. The station was largely destroyed in 1970, although the clay-surfaced platform and retaining sleepers, stone walling, and the brick chimney stack belonging to the permanent way hut situated at the down end of the platform, survived until the site was infilled and used for gardens.

While there he met Malcolm \\"Molly\\" Duncan and Alan Gorrie. The three of them relocated to London separately, but joined forces again in 1971 to form the nucleus of the Average White Band (AWB). They were later joined by Onnie McIntyre, Hamish Stuart and Robbie McIntosh, completing the original line-up. These six Scots were an unlikely group to be successful playing American styled funk, but went on to be nominated for three Grammy Awards in the Rhythm & Blues category. Ball was the principal composer of \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\" which topped the US Billboard chart on 22 February 1975. It was written from a rehearsal \\"jam\\" over which he superimposed the melody line and the bridge. Since then it has been covered by many musicians and used in television programmes, films and commercials. He co-wrote a total of forty three songs for the Average White Band. Before forming AWB in 1971, Ball was a session musician in London, arranging and playing for Vinegar Joe, Badfinger, Kiki Dee and Elton John, Mama Cass, Bryan Ferry, Roxy Music and others. He has played on stage with Chaka Khan and Marvin Gaye. As an arranger with AWB he wrote and played with Michael and Randy Brecker. In 1995 he released his first solo album, Street Struttin' and, in 2005, his second CD, Childsplay.

Jan van Hooff (1981) by Auke Hettema on the Markt in Eindhoven. Johan Frederik Rudolph \\"Jan\\" van Hooff (26 August 1755 ‚Äì 13 June 1816, in Utrecht) was a Dutch Patriot politician and statesman. Biography Van Hooff was born in Eindhoven in 1755, to Martinus van Hooff (co-mayor of the town) and Anna Elisabeth Bols van Arendonck. He studied law, got his doctorate in law at Nancy and opened a law practice in Eindhoven. He was elected co-mayor of the town in 1786. During his career he was mayor of Eindhoven, member of the First National Assembly, the Second National Assembly, the Executive Power and the Legislative Power. In 1786 he founded the Vaderlandse Soci√´teit Concordia (English: National Sciety Concordia) together with Amandus van Moorsel; this society was a social club in name, but a Patriot organization in reality. Several town notables joined this society. In 1787 Jan van Hoff and several other Eindhoven Patriots traveled to Utrecht to join the Patriot Army. This army was defeated by the Prussian Army, after which Van Hooff was arrested (in October 1787) for his Patriottic activities, on the orders of the States-General of the Netherlands; he was taken to The Hague and imprisoned. He was released shortly thereafter and returned to Eindhoven. However, he was re-arrested on 12 February 1788 (in Eindhoven this time), but managed to escape. In 1789 there was a failed, pro- French rebellion in the Southern Netherlands. Fearing that the insurrection would spread to the Generality Lands, the States-General posted a garrison in Eindhoven; Van Hooff left the town. In 1792 he was in Paris together with Herman Willem Daendels, where the French Republic had been proclaimed. He sought (and received) French support for the reparation of Batavian freedom (Dutch: herstelling van de Bataafse vrijheid); French troops arrived in Eindhoven on March 6, 1793 and the freedom tree was planted in the town on that day. The French were subsequently pushed back by the Austrians, but took permanent possession of the town following the 1794 Battle of Fleurus. Van Hooff became a member of the Batavian Revolutionary Committee that year, but got into a conflict with Maximilien Robespierre. He was arrested on May 28 and imprisoned at the Paris Conciergerie. A clerical error in the spelling of his name saved Van Hooff from the guillotine and he was released again on October 29. He remained in freedom until the coup of 22 January 1798, after which he was arrested and imprisoned -- first at the Gevangenpoort in The Hague, later at the Palace Huis Ten Bosch. He was finally released on July 14. He served as Minister for Justice and was a member of the State Council until 1810. He then retired and spent the rest of his life as a citizen without office. He died without having been married. Monuments and statues The city of Eindhoven commissioned Auke Hettema to make a statue of Van Hooff in 1981. The statue is currently on the Markt in Eindhoven.

A vast political, social, and military panorama of the French Revolution up to the autumn of 1792, its many episodes range from the life of ordinary working people through the committed bourgeois struggling for change up to those in the upper echelons of society defending the status quo. Plot Centred on characters from the rebellious city of Marseille, most of the great events of the Revolution from 1789 to 1792 occur offstage. In Marseille, citizens capture the royal fortress of Fort Saint-Jean and set up a revolutionary council. When war is declared against Austria in April 1792, the city raises a force of 500 volunteers who march to Paris. Entertained there to a banquet, a man from Alsace sings a patriotic ballad which moves the men from Marseille. Adopting it as their marching song, it is soon known as La Marseillaise. In July Prussia joins forces with Austria and the people, enraged by the threats in the Brunswick Manifesto, storm the Tuileries Palace, making prisoners of the King and Queen. A volunteer army then marches east to face the highly professional Prussian forces and in September, to the astonishment of the world, beats them at Valmy. Fictional characters and happenings are mixed in with historical characters and actual events. While careful to show genuine revolutionaries who wanted constitutional change rather than mob violence or anarchy, as well as privileged people who accepted the need for ordered change, Renoir often uses members of the public to express the ferment of ideas that gripped France. Reception La Marseillaise, while not one of Renoir's better-known films, has received positive reviews from today's critics.

He previously played in MLB for the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Tampa Bay Rays. He made his MLB debut in 2013. Early life Travis d'Arnaud was born in Long Beach, California, to Marita (Filipino-American), an elementary school teacher, and Lance d'Arnaud, an entrepreneur. His older brother, Chase, is also a professional baseball player. D'Arnaud also has a younger sister, Lindsey. A fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers growing up, his favorite player was Mike Piazza. Lance d'Arnaud converted his son to catcher at age 12 because the team that he was coaching had a vacancy at that position. D'Arnaud attended Lakewood High School in Lakewood, California. As a high school ballplayer, d'Arnaud was named Lakewood's co-Athlete of the Year along with Artesia High School basketball player James Harden, a future NBA All-Star. He was also awarded an ABCA/Rawlings High School Gold Glove award in 2007. D'Arnaud had committed to play college baseball for the Pepperdine Waves of Pepperdine University after high school, the same school for which his brother played, but was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the supplemental first round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft, the 37th overall pick. He chose to void his college commitment and signed a minor league contract for $832,500. Professional career=Philadelphia Phillies In 2007, d'Arnaud started his professional career with the Philadelphia Phillies' Rookie League affiliate, the Gulf Coast League Phillies. He played 41 games in the GCL and put together a .241 batting average and a .626 OPS.

The Phillies received Roy Halladay, along with $6,000,000 from the Blue Jays. Toronto received d'Arnaud, Kyle Drabek and Michael Taylor, who they later flipped to the Oakland Athletics for Brett Wallace. Wallace was then traded to the Houston Astros for center-field prospect Anthony Gose. D'Arnaud played the entire 2010 season with the Dunedin Blue Jays, the Blue Jays' High-A affiliate in the Florida State League. Despite suffering from back problems and playing in a higher league, d'Arnaud put up comparable numbers to his 2009 campaign, hitting .259, an OPS of .726 and 6 home runs in 71 games. For the week of April 19, d'Arnaud was named FSL Player of the Week and was selected to participate in the midsummer Home Run Derby. He was named a Mid-Season and Post-Season All-Star. In 2011, d'Arnaud played the entire 2011 season in the Eastern League, with the Blue Jays Double-A affiliate, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats.

D'Arnaud got his first major league hit on August 20 against Atlanta Braves pitcher Luis Ayala in the 8th inning. He hit his first Major League home run on August 25, a two-run shot off Detroit Tigers pitcher Rick Porcello. The home run earned Travis a curtain call from the Mets fans. Travis finished the season appearing in 31 games batting .202 in 99 at-bats in 112 plate appearances with 20 hits, 1 home run, 5 RBIs, 12 walks, 4 runs scored and 21 strikeouts. =2014= On May 13, d'Arnaud suffered the third concussion of his professional career, when he was hit by Alfonso Soriano's backswing.

On June 24, d'Arnaud was called back up to the Mets and resumed his role as starting catcher. In response, Teagarden was placed on the disabled list with a left hamstring strain. On the same day, d'Arnaud hit a three-run home run off Scott Kazmir of the Oakland Athletics in the bottom of the third inning with two outs taking a 4-1 lead to a 7-1 lead.

He was reactivated off the disabled list on June 10 when Danny Muno was sent down to the 51s. In a game against the Atlanta Braves in Atlanta on June 20, d'Arnaud left the game in the sixth inning due to an injured elbow. D'Arnaud, who had a two-run single and a solo homer, was hurt trying to tag A. J. Pierzynski, who was trying to score on a sacrifice fly to left. Michael Cuddyer's throw was up the third-base line, and Pierzynski collided with d'Arnaud, who couldn't hold on to the ball. He was re-placed on the disabled list with a sprained left elbow. Catcher Johnny Monell replaced him on the roster. He was brought back on July 30 with Anthony Recker sent down. Travis finished the season appearing in 67 games batting .268 in 239 at-bats in 268 plate appearances with 64 hits, 12 home runs, 41 RBIs, 23 walks, 31 runs scored and 49 strikeouts.

After a rehab stint with the St. Lucie Mets and Las Vegas 51s, d'Arnaud was reactivated in June and Plawecki was sent down, with Rivera staying as the backup. On July 5, 2016, d'Arnaud switched his uniform number from 7 to 18 to offer a salute to retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning, and to give Jos√© Reyes the number he had worn his whole MLB career. =2017= d'Arnaud with the Mets in 2017 On May 5, 2017, d'Arnaud was placed on the 10-day disabled list due a bruised right wrist. He was activated on May 24. On August 16, following injuries to Jos√© Reyes and Wilmer Flores, the Mets started d'Arnaud at third base. Terry Collins chose to move d'Arnaud back and forth between third and second base, swapping him with Asdr√∫bal Cabrera twelve times, in order to minimize his impact on the defense. =2018= D'Arnaud began the season as the Mets' Opening Day catcher. On April 11, d'Arnaud was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a partial tear of the UCL in his right elbow. He had Tommy John surgery on April 17.

As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a total population of 10,244, down from 10,298 at the 2000 census. In 2018, the US Census estimated the population to be 11,160. The gated Leisure World retirement community in the city of Seal Beach is to the south of Rossmoor, Los Alamitos is to the east and north, and Long Beach is to the west (on the other side of the San Gabriel River, the 605 freeway and the border with Los Angeles County). The community of Rossmoor has two shopping centers within its boundaries, but only one‚Äîthe Rossmoor Village Square, is now within the political boundaries of the Rossmoor Community Services District. A larger shopping center, the Rossmoor Business Center, has been remodeled and renamed the Shops at Rossmoor; it was annexed, despite many protests, by the City of Seal Beach in 1967. History The Rossmoor community was developed from 1955 through 1961 by Ross W. Cortese, who had earlier developed the architecturally-significant Lakewood Rancho Estates in Long Beach (1953) and the Frematic Homes (1954) in Anaheim, just north and west of Disneyland. Cortese's original partners in securing the first large parcels of land that would become Rossmoor included California governor Goodwin Knight and Judge Alfred Gittelson, who had also partnered with him in the Lakewood Rancho Estates and the Frematic homes. (It was Gittelson who later agreed to annex his Rossmoor Shopping Center property to Seal Beach in the late 1960s.) After Rossmoor, Cortese would construct the first of his very successful Leisure World gated retirement community in that part of Seal Beach which is immediately south of Rossmoor. The Rossmoor community is easy to recognize because of its red brick \\"signature wall\\" that borders the entire unincorporated community. It is a signature of the Rossmoor community that differentiates it from neighboring cities Los Alamitos and Seal Beach. There are 3,430 single family homes, 1 apartment complex (Rossmoor Manor), and 1 town house complex (Rossmoor Town Houses) within Rossmoor. Rossmoor annexation debates=History According to a June 2006 consultant's report to the Rossmoor Planning Committee, the most cost effective solution for Rossmoor would be to be annexed by the city of Seal Beach. Although it is not part of the city of Los Alamitos, it is served under the Los Alamitos \\"sphere of influence\\" and was proposed to be annexed to the city by 2007 after the Local Agency Formation Commission reviews the proposal. Another proposal would combine Rossmoor with adjacent Seal Beach and Los Alamitos to form one city. Rossmoor is served by the Rossmoor/Los Alamitos Area Sewer District. The mainly residential area is also served by the Rossmoor Community Services District (RCSD), which serves the community as an independent functionary does. The RCSD provides services related to public recreation facilities and park development for Rush Park, Rossmoor Park, two mini parks and the Montecito Center. The RCSD also administers street lighting, road rights-of-way services, sewer services and, subject to the consent of the County of Orange, the collection and disposal of garbage or refuse matter, and street sweeping. However, the RCSD cannot make decisions about the future of the community, which is all delegated to the County of Orange's Unincorporated Islands Program and the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Current status At the May 22, 2008 meeting, OC LAFCO recommended that the Rossmoor Incorporation Plan go to a vote of the community. A vote by residents on the issue of incorporation was held on November 4, 2008. The proposition for cityhood was resoundingly defeated by a vote of 72% to 28% indicating that the majority of residents desire not be incorporated as a city. Residents also voted down three separate utility tax proposals by a wide margin.

Biography=Early work in Vienna and Bjelovar Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Molve (1855‚Äì1862) is the earliest work reliably attributed to Klein. Klein was born into an evangelical family in Vienna where he received training in building and stone carving trades, and completed two years of architecture studies at the Academy of Fine Arts. For some time, he worked as a draughtsman in Vienna. He moved to Croatia in 1851, successfully applied for a job as a bricklayer foreman in the Vara≈ædin-ƒêurƒëevac Regiment, and spent the next eight years working for the Regiment in Bjelovar, until he was transferred to Zagreb in 1859. It is known that Klein designed and built a number of public buildings during his stay in Bjelovar, but there are no surviving records which would support a reliable attribution. It is conjectured that several buildings in Bjelovar - such as Adjutant's house (1855‚Äì1859), Sergeant Major's house (1855‚Äì1856) and the prison building (1854‚Äì1861) - were actually designed by Klein. His earliest known work is the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Molve, built between 1855 and 1862. It is the most significant example of Rundbogenstil in sacred architecture of Croatia. Work in Zagreb Klein was commissioned to build the Zagreb Synagogue. Construction began in 1866 and was completed the following year. He also built Zagreb Orthodox Cathedral located on the Petar Preradoviƒá Square. In 1868 Klein and Janko Grahor founded a construction company called Grahor and Klein. After Klein left the company in 1886, it was renamed to Grahor and Sons.

It is now a four-star senior living community.  History = Mansion House  The Mansion House was the first hotel built at this site on top of the bluff in St. Joseph in 1831. Awed by the panoramic view, August Newell built a rough log cabin lodging house. The moniker \\"Mansion House\\" was supposedly intentional sarcasm, as it was not a mansion nor much of a house, but the views were spectacular. The Mansion House became a popular stagecoach stop between Chicago to Detroit. The building was torn down in 1866 and replaced by the St. Charles Hotel.  St. Charles Hotel  Charles Krieger tore down the Mansion House and built the St. Charles Hotel, which opened to the public in 1868. Upon construction, it was deemed \\"the biggest and most beautiful (hotel) in the area\\". The St. Charles and other new hotels in the area helped to cement St. Joseph as a tourist destination. The St. Charles Hotel changed hands several times over the years.  Hotel Whitcomb  In the 1880s, steamship traffic on Lake Michigan continued to grow, transporting both cargo and passengers. In 1889, the Detroit & Cleveland Steam Navigation Company (D&C;) started to run two round-trips per day between Chicago and St. Joseph. This created new potential for tourism as Chicago residents escaped the city for relaxing views of the lake. An enterprising general agent for the D&C; named C.D. Whitcomb purchased the St. Charles Hotel. It is unknown whether this was with his own money or with company funds. The hotel was refurbished and renamed the Hotel Whitcomb.  Mineral Baths  In 1905, the Hotel Whitcomb discovered it had more to offer than just great views. There had been Native American legends of foul- smelling gas rising from cracks in the ground near the hotel. Geologists confirmed there was an underground sulfur spring in the area and the Hotel Whitcomb began piping the water into its own mineral baths. This extra amenity attracted even more tourists from around the country. So much so that a \\"moving staircase\\" was constructed to take people up the bluff from the ferry landing. It cost a penny to ride it.  The New Whitcomb Hotel  By 1927, the original 1868 structure had begun to show its age. In just six weeks, several prominent merchants in the area raised $1 million to build a new hotel. Jane Addams, who vacationed in the area, recommended the Chicago-based Pond Brothers. Modeled after Mediterranean resorts, the neo-Tudor design was an 'L'-shaped seven story structure with a square tower at the corner, capped by a bell-cast copper cupola. The brick exterior has trim of white stone. The original hotel has 225 rooms, dining space for 800, a sunken garden and a 60 tub bathhouse. It opened on May 3, 1928 to much fanfare.  The Whitcomb  Renovated in the early 1970s, the Whitcomb Hotel has now become \\"The Whitcomb,\\" a four-star senior living community. It is one of Southwestern Michigan's most coveted retirement communities where St. Joe's history continues to shine.

As a form of political speech, it appears in the Debates and Proceedings of the Convention for the Revision of the State of Ohio in the mid 19th century.

L. Mencken lampooned Harding's bloviate style as gamalielese, from his middle name of Gamaliel. He complained that the style was suited to Ohio yokels: In this he was responding to The New York Times which had defended Harding's style as presidential: Gender differences Writer Katha Pollitt speculates that men have a greater tendency to bloviate than women -- possibly a result of their socialization.

Aided by Alfonso the Magnanimous, the Albanian leader Skanderbeg made plans to recapture Svetigrad, which had been lost in 1448. His strategy involved launching an invasion of Macedonia to devastate the country surrounding Svetigrad and to lure the garrison into a trap. While implementing this, he was stopped in the fields of Polog near Tetovo by a force which was planning to invade Albania led by his old friend Ibrahim Pasha. The force was quickly destroyed and Skanderbeg's army proceeded its looting before returning to Debar. Background Skanderbeg lost Svetigrad in 1448 after a two-month- long siege. The fortress was vital to his strategic defense of Albania as it guarded one of the main mountain passes into the country from Macedonia. He, therefore, made efforts to regain it with the help of Alfonso V of Aragon; in the Treaty of Gaeta signed in 1451, Skanderbeg became a vassal of Alfonso in return for financial and military aid for his ongoing war with the Turks. In the winter of 1452, Skanderbeg made plans for his offensive and thus received much-needed artillery and arquebuses from Alfonso.Francione p. 107. Prelude In the spring of 1453, Skanderbeg moved into Macedonia. During the night, Skanderbeg's army marched through a severe storm, hoping to surprise the Turks. Near Tetovo Skanderbeg's force met an opposing Ottoman force of 14,000 men led by Ibrahim Pasha, one of Skanderbeg's old friends during his service in the Ottoman army. Skanderbeg ordered the march to halt and made plans to retreat into the Mokra valley, hoping to entice his opponent into a trap. But Ibrahim did not follow and instead bivouacked on the field of Polog. This maneuver blocked further incursions into Macedonia. In the Albanian camp, battleplans were being made while the Turkish camp remained quiet. Moisi Arianit Golemi proposed making a night attack but Skanderbeg was reluctant since a powerful storm was sweeping through, making it difficult to launch an attack; Hamza Kastrioti supported Moisiu.Francione p. 108. Battle Skanderbeg's doubts soon faded and he made plans for an attack on his enemy's camp. On 22 April, despite the storms, Skanderbeg launched a swift cavalry attack which broke into the enemy camp causing disorder and chaos. Skanderbeg confronted Ibrahim and challenged him to a personal duel. Skanderbeg came out victorious and beheaded his opponent. His head was placed on a pike in a manner similar to W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland's execution and upon being informed, the Turkish troops quickly fled. Aftermath The Turks left behind 3,000 dead. Skanderbeg's army continued looting before returning to Debar. He returned triumphantly with his army with whom he had split his booty.Franco p. 317. The same year, the Byzantine Empire fell after the fall of Constantinople. This was a blow to Skanderbeg and the entire Christian world who now feared Rome would suffer a similar fate.

She formerly coached Loras College (a Division III school) from 1990‚Äì92 and Creighton from 1992‚Äì2002. In 2009‚Äì10, Yori was named the Naismith College Coach of the Year, AP College Basketball Coach of the Year and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association Coach of the Year after guiding Nebraska to a 32‚Äì2 record and the school's first-ever trip to the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship Sweet 16. Early life=High school Yori was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and attended Ankeny High School in Ankeny, Iowa, where she graduated in 1982. In her six- on-six high school basketball career (girls' rules were different back then, using six players instead of five), Yori compiled 3,068 points in her career. In 1980 the Hawkettes were state champions and in 1981 were runners‚Äìup. She was also a star softball player, garnering four First Team All-State selections as a shortstop while leading Ankeny to three state championships in 1979, 1980 and 1981. Yori is a two-time inductee into the Iowa Girls' High School Athletic Union Hall of Fame‚Äîonce as a basketball player, the other as a softball player. College Yori attended Creighton University and played basketball for four years. She scored 2,010 points, which ranks third all-time in Bluejays' women's basketball history, and she is also near (or at) the top of numerous other school records as well, resulting in her induction to the Creighton Athletics Hall of Fame and having her jersey number (#25) retired: *First: Career scoring average (20.3 ppg), points in a game (42), field goals made in a game (20) *Second: Career field goals made (797), free throws made (416) *Fourth: Rebounds (746) *Fifth: Field goal percentage (.542), assists (399) *Seventh: Blocked shots (69) Coaching career= Creighton assistant / Loras College (1986‚Äì92)  Yori began her coaching career at her alma mater in 1986, the same year she graduated in May 1986 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. After spending three seasons assisting the Bluejays program, Yori moved to Miami, Florida where she earned a master's degree in sports administration from St. Thomas University while serving as the head softball coach for one season. Yori's first head coaching job was at Loras College, a Division III institution in Dubuque, Iowa. She served there for two years (1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92). She compiled records of 10‚Äì15 and then 15‚Äì10 to bring her two-year stint to a 25‚Äì25 overall record (17‚Äì19 in conference play).  Creighton (1992‚Äì2002)  In 1992‚Äì93, Yori secured the head coaching job back at Creighton after her former coach and mentor, Bruce Rasmussen, accepted an associate director position at the school. She had immediate success in her first season as she led the Bluejays to the school's second-ever NCAA Tournament appearance, earning the 10th-seed in the Midwest Region. Creighton would lose to eventual national champion Texas in the second round. Despite a 24‚Äì7 overall record (12‚Äì4 in conference play) in 1993‚Äì94, Yori's second, the Bluejays did not get invited to a postseason tournament. It would be Yori's personally best season as head coach until her final year with Creighton in 2001‚Äì02. That season, Creighton once again compiled a 24‚Äì7 overall record (16‚Äì2 conference) to claim the 2002 Missouri Valley Conference regular-season and tournament championships. The Bluejays, seeded 12th in the Mideast Region, would lose to Florida International University in the first round 73‚Äì58.  Nebraska (2002‚Äì16)  The Cornhuskers struggled mightily in Yori's first season as head coach in 2002‚Äì03. They finished the season last in the Big 12 Conference (12th place) and recorded an 8‚Äì20 overall record (1‚Äì15 conference). The following season, Nebraska had a 10-game turnaround as they finished 18‚Äì12 (7‚Äì9). They were invited to the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) where they made it to the second round. Over the course of the next five seasons, Nebraska compiled an overall record of 95‚Äì65 (41‚Äì39), never placing higher than 4th in the conference. Yori led them to two NCAA Tournaments (2007, 2008) but did not make it past the first or second round, respectively. On April 5, 2016 Yori resigned after 14 years at the helm. The Lincoln Journal Star reports the resignation comes on the heels of an investigation by the athletic department that Yori mistreated players. Yori posted a record of 280-166 and led the Huskers to a pair of conference titles and seven trips to the NCAA Tournament. = 2009‚Äì10 season = Connie Yori, cutting the nets after leading Nebraska to the 2010 Big 12 Conference regular-season title with a perfect 16-0 record The 2009‚Äì10 season was the most successful year in the Nebraska women's basketball program's history. After finishing the 2008‚Äì09 campaign with a 15‚Äì16 (6‚Äì10, T-7th) record, the Cornhuskers rolled through the 2009‚Äì10 season with an undefeated 29‚Äì0 (16‚Äì0) regular season, becoming the first team in Big 12 history to record an unbeaten regular season, and only the second to record a perfect conference record. They won their first regular season conference title, but were upset by Texas A&M; in the Big 12 Tournament semifinals. Nebraska was unranked in every preseason poll, but at the season's end were #4 in both the Associated Press and Coaches' Polls. They had never even been ranked in the top 10 before, but spent the last nine weeks of the regular season in the top 10, peaking at #3 for a time. Yori guided the Cornhuskers to the program's first-ever #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. After posting 83‚Äì44 and 83‚Äì70 victories over Northern Iowa and UCLA, respectively, Nebraska advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history. They were then upset by the 4th-seeded Kentucky Wildcats, 76‚Äì67, where their season would end at 32‚Äì2. After shattering the old program record of 23 for wins in a season, and for Nebraska's 15-game turnaround, Yori received the Big 12 Conference, WBCA Region 5, U.S. Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), Women's Basketball Coaches Association Coach of the Year and Naismith Coach of the Year awards.

Life Beasley was born in 1881 in East Plumstead in Kent and developed an interest in ethnography at a young age. Beasley was privately wealthy after inheriting the North Kent Brewery and, in 1914, married his cousin Irene Marguerite Beasley. The same year, he became a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute and was an active member until 1937, serving as vice-president between 1932 and 1937. With his wife, Beasley settled in Cranmore House in Chislehurst and there set up the Cranmore Ethnographical Museum which eventually held more than 6,000 objects of ethnographical interest. The Beasley's collected objects from across Europe, buying from auction houses and local museums to expand the collection, which contained material from the Pacific, Asia, Africa, and Northwestern America. Beasley wrote numerous articles for anthropological journals and was considered an expert in his field. He died from diabetes in 1939 and his collection was stored with the British Museum collections during the war, which was fortunate as the Cranmore Museum was destroyed by bombing. After the war substantial portions of the collection were passed to the British Museum, the Royal Museum in Edinburgh, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge, the Pitt Rivers Museum and the Merseyside County Museum. Other pieces were sold by his widow and, after her death in 1974, by their daughters.

Issued as the \\"B\\" side of their hit \\"Can You Jerk Like Me\\", this song broke out as a hit on its own, reaching #37 on the Cash Box R&B; listings that year.(Billboard had temporarily suspended its R&B; Chart in 1964.) Written, composed, and produced by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, this song was different from every other tune the Contours had recorded up to that point. A unique counterpoint to the group's trademark rough, raucous delivery, \\"That Day\\" was a soft, quiet, and heart-felt ballad with a unique call and response delivery,(structured like a \\"question and answer session\\"). Though the song wasn't on the \\"A\\" side, it still became a hit, making it The Contours' only charting flip-side hit. In the song, Billy Gordon, the lead singer, acts as the narrator, while the rest of the group (Billy Hoggs, Sylvester Potts, Joe Billingslea, Hubert Johnson, and guitarist Huey Davis) ask him questions. The song serves as a cautionary tale on how he lost the love of his life. This song has inspired a cover version by the Los Angeles-based R&B; group The Performers and Cleveland Ohio-based group Sly Slick and Wicked, and has been issued on several Contours and Motown \\"greatest hits\\" collections including The Complete Motown Singles: Volume 4 and the now out-of-print Motown CD collection, The Very Best of the Contours.

Williams spent his wrestling career in the persona of a villainous heel under the pseudonym \\"El Bandito\\", and after retiring as a fighter he became a promoter, manager and television presenter. He is recognised as one of the most famous wrestlers to come from Wales. Early history Williams was born in the small village of Ysbyty Ifan in North Wales in 1931. He was the son of a local quarryman, and was educated at the local primary school. Williams was accustomed to fighting from a young age, including war evacuees from Liverpool and practising boxing with his village friends. Despite his combative nature, Williams was awarded a place in the local grammar school at nearby Llanrwst. After leaving school, Williams spent his National Service with the RAF; and on discharge he became a professional footballer. He played for several notable teams around North Wales and the north of England, including Bangor City, Shrewsbury Town, Oldham Athletic and Pwllheli. He later became the player-manager of Welsh team Nantlle Vale, and the club, under his mentoring, became known as a very dirty and overly violent team. Williams himself was one of the worst members of his team, and would often be red carded and sent off for his repeated fouling. After a particularly rough game, he received an injury, which forced his retirement from football. Before leaving football, Williams had noticed the local crowds dwindling, with one of the major factors being the televised wrestling, which was being shown mid-day on Saturdays. He took advantage of this new fad, and began working as a wrestler and boxer in fairgrounds; though he nearly lost his job as he could not bring himself to take the hat around the spectators, as he believed it was akin to begging. Wrestling career By the mid 1960s Williams became the top-billing performer on the independent wrestling circuit. As his career progressed he was invited to fight in India. While in India he wrestled the Bholu Brothers, and on one occasion he was awoken at night by Bholu Pahalwan who told him that the entire troupe was leaving for Pakistan as another promoter was offering more money. Williams went with them, spending another 18 months in Asia. Later in his life, Williams stated that fighting with the Bholu Brothers was the highlight of his career. Other tours saw him take in the Middle East, the Far East, Continental Europe and America. While in America he adopted the wrestling name, \\"El Bandito\\", due to his large handlebar moustache. As a wrestler, Williams played as a heel, and enjoyed being physically imposing. He would hurl himself at his opponents and did not hold back his foot stomps on prone combatants. He believed in hard matches, and often quoted the old saying \\"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen\\", during his matches. Despite his hard-man image, Williams was a popular member of the wrestling community, and went on to promote several fighters including Adrian Street, \\"Mighty\\" John Quinn, Tony St Clair, Mark Rocco and Johnny Saint. In the 1980s, as a popular showman and a natural Welsh speaker, Williams was offered the job of presenting S4C's wrestling show, Reslo. Although ITV had shown wrestling on British television since the 1950s, Williams brought different forms of matches to Welsh audiences, including cage fights, chain matches, pole matches and female fighting, none of which had been done on ITV. Williams set up a training gym at his house, and many female wrestlers graduated from his 'Garage' training facility including Tina Starr, Rusty Blair, Carla Sanchez and Bella Ogunlana. Williams was an avid promoter of wrestling bouts and appropriated the name 'British Wrestling Federation', under which his shows were sometimes held. He also appeared in many of his own bills, stating \\"No point in wasting money for another wrestler\\". Later life In his later life Williams became a sports journalist for the Daily Post, and in 1985 he wrote his autobiography Cario'r Ddraig: Stori El Bandito. For his continual promotion of the Welsh language, he was made a member of the Gorsedd of Bards at the 2000 National Eisteddfod at Llanelli. Williams was a Welsh nationalist, but he believed that the people of Wales should broaden their horizons through travel and self-learning to understand their country's own identity better. He also had a very positive outlook on the abilities of the Welsh, and was disappointed with the negativity of many of his countrymen. He died from a sudden heart attack in 2009, and was survived by his wife Wendy, and daughter Tara Bethan. In 2008 Tara went on to become a finalist in the BBC One television series I'd Do Anything, and mentioned her time being babysat by British wrestling superstars.

He was also the drummer during Necrophagist's Epitaph era and played with Obscura . Biography=Early life Hannes Grossmann was born on September 8, 1982 in Bayreuth. He started playing the piano at the age of 8 and later moved on to what was to be his main instrument, the drum kit, at age 10. He lives in Nuremberg. Professional career In 2003 Hannes Grossmann began to play drums in the technical death metal band Necrophagist and later recorded drums for the album Epitaph in 2004 which features complex polyrhythmic drumming and blastbeats of up to 240 bpm. Hannes stated in an interview on onlinedrummer.com that the drum lines were the ones previously programmed by Necrophagist frontman Muhammed Suicmez, which he played in (almost) exactly the same way, which was exactly one of the reasons Hannes left Necrophagist later on. Hannes left Necrophagist in 2007 to join the band Obscura, along with his Necrophagist bandmate, Christian Muenzner, and Dutch bass player Jeroen Paul Thesseling, that has previously played in Pestilence. In 2008, Obscura were signed by Relapse Records and have gone on to release the album Cosmogenesis which was met with very positive reactions and cracked the US Newcomer Billboard. On September 28, 2010, Hannes joined the instrumental metal band Blotted Science, which features Ron Jarzombek (Spastic Ink) and Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse). With them, he has recorded on The Animation of Entomology EP, which was released in 2011. He is also a member of Ron Jarzombek's latest musical venture Terrestrial Exiled with bandmate and countryman Christian Muenzner as well as Spastic Ink bassist Pete Perez. He was also involved in recording Christian Muenzner's solo album, Timewarp, which also features Steve DiGiorgio. To complete the list of his 2011 releases, he has recorded Obscura's third LP, Omnivium, that was, once again, met very positively by the fans and critics alike. Hannes also teaches online drum lessons, which include personally customized lessons as well as stock drum video workshops that focus on Metal drumming. In 2014, he released his first solo album, The Radial Covenant, which features a plethora of guest musicians including Christian Muenzner, Jeff Loomis, Ron Jarzombek, Morean and Per Nilsson. In 2018 Grossmann joined Thomas Gabriel Fischer's band Triptykon, replacing Norman Lonhard.

Listed at , 155 lb., Nesbitt batted and threw left-handed. She was born Marie Crews Nesbitt in Greenville, South Carolina.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Brief profile Nesbitt enjoyed many firsts in her fruitful All-American Girls Professional Baseball League career. She is recognized as one of the sixty original founding members of the league. An ideal fastpitch, knuckleball left-handed, she was one of the most dominant pitchers in the early years of the circuit. The unpredictable movement of her pitches made it almost impossible to hit, until a severe injury suffered in a regular game shortened her promising career. She posted a 65‚Äì49 record with a 2.44 earned run average in 120 pitching appearances. After that she switched to first base, to become a dangerous and productive hitter through the rest of her career, ranking among the top 10 AAGPBL players for five out of her six seasons. Her accomplishments also included appearing in the first ever AAGPBL All-Star Game and by collecting a .422 on-base percentage and a .393 of slugging, while her .282 batting average ranks her sixth in the all-time list of hitters who had a minimum of 1000 at bat appearances.How To Pitch A Knuckleball Underhand Softball PitchAll-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. Early life Nesbitt played ball ever since elementary school. At age 12 she hurled in a fast-pitch softball league in her hometown, and later played for some championship teams in Illinois and Florida, as well as for a men's team in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where baseball scout Jimmy Hamilton was impressed with her talent. He decided to inviting the young pitcher to an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League tryout. The AAGPBL was a circuit that began to operate in 1943 in cities located on or near Lake Michigan. The main promoter was Philip K. Wrigley, owner of the Chicago Cubs, who worried about the viability of male professional baseball players during World War II decided to establish an alternate attraction. By sending out scouts and setting up try-outs in dozens of major cities, Wrigley attracted hundreds of women from all over United States and Canada who were eager to play in the new professional league. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final try-outs at Wrigley Field in Chicago, where 60 were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. The girls were placed on the rosters of four fifteen-player teams: Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Mary Nesbitt was one of them. Her tryout in Chicago was a success, and she was allocated to the Belles at the age of 18. The average full-time worker made $1,299 a year in the 1940s, according to one estimate, or about $25 a week. Players in the AAGBBL made between $50 and $125 a week during a three-month, 108-game season. At the time, clubs of girls (never called women) seemed like a way to fill ballparks, according to an article in Smithsonian magazine in 1989, but the league lasted twelve successful seasons before folding in 1954. It was a neglected chapter of sports history, at least until filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her 1992 A League of Their Own, which was a fictionalized account of activities in the AAGPBL. Starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Lori Petty and Rosie O'Donnell, this film brought a rejuvenated interest to the extinct league.A Bibliography of Smithsonian Magazine: 1980‚Äì1989IMDb.com ‚Äì A League of Their Own (1992) AAGPBL career During her first three seasons Nesbitt played first base when she was not pitching. In 1943, the Racine Belles, with Johnny Gottselig at the helm, won both the first half of the season and AAGPBL championship behind a strong effort by Nesbitt, who led the pitching staff with a 26‚Äì13 record for a .667 winning percentage (fifth-best of the league), including 308 innings of work in 47 appearances. She also hit .280, scored 34 runs, and drove in 29 more in 73 games. At a time of the season, Nesbitt put together an 11-game winning streak. On July 1, 1943 took effect the first All-Star Game of the league, which coincidentally was the first night game ever played at Wrigley Field. The game was played under temporary lights between two teams composed of Blue Sox and Peaches players against Comets and Belles players. Besides Nesbitt, the Belles also counted with Joanne Winter, who posted an 11‚Äì11 record, to give the team a strong one-two pitching staff, while Margaret Danhauser, Maddy English, Edythe Perlick and Claire Schillace could be counted on for their bats and solid defense. The attack was led by slugging right fielder Eleanor Dapkus, who hit a league-lead 10 home runs, while the speedy Sophie Kurys stole 44 bases and scored 60 runs. Irene Hickson, who shared the catching duties with Dorothy Maguire,was known as an opportune hitter with runners in scoring position during the late innings. Most importantly, Hickson was a solid fielding catcher with a strong throwing arm, and had a reputation as a good handler of pitchers. Early in the season, Nesbitt and Hickson were referred as the ‚Ä≥Belles Chattanooga Battery‚Ä≥, because both were scouted by Jimmy Hamilton in there.1943 Racine BellesThe Evening Independent ‚Äì August 13, 1943 The first AAGPBL Championship Series pitted first-half winner Racine against Kenosha Comets, second-half champ. In the best-of-five series, Racine swept Kenosha to clinch the first championship in the league's history. Nesbitt claimed complete-game victories in Games 1 and 3, and saved Game 2 after starter Winter ran into trouble in the eight inning. Meanwhile, Hickson led all-hitters with a .417 average and five RBI in the three games. In 1944, when the league added the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes, the Belles missed the playoffs, producing losing records of 28‚Äì32 and 26‚Äì31 while ranking fourth of the six teams in both halves of the season. Nesbitt posted the team's only winning record, 23‚Äì17, with a career-high 106 strikeouts in 45 games, while the other pitchers of Racine suffered off years. Winter slipped to a 15‚Äì23 ledger, and the rest of the staff combined for a 16‚Äì23 mark. Nesbitt also provided some help with her bat, hitting .220 with 14 runs and 23 RBI in 74 games. Nesbitt stayed on the mound until she fractured her collarbone in 1945. She finished with a 16‚Äì19 record in 37 appearances, while hitting a league-best .319 in 66 games, while the league average was a measly .198 that year. Incidentally, the relatively low batting averages in the early years reflect mainly the high quality of AAGPBL pitchers, rather than a lack of skills by the hitters.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record BookAll-American Girls Professional Baseball League Batting and Pitching champions Nesbitt did not play in 1946. She married Vester Wisham, who worked for the Racine team. They were working a farm in Georgia when a scout was sent out to find her and see about coming back to play in the league again. The scout paid her a $500 bonus for sign up, and she opened 1947 with the Peoria Redwings. That season the AAGPBL moved its spring training camp to Havana, Cuba. Two hundred girls made the trip to Havana, and for many the flight was their first airplane trip. The girls stayed at the Seville-Biltmore Hotel and played their games at the Gran Stadium. All the teams were filmed for Fox News going down the steps at the University of Havana. After the injury, she had less command of her array of pitches, especially her hard knuckleball, and she was given the chance to play on a regular basis at first base. She responded with a .261 average in 110 games, including 47 runs, 58 RBI, and a grand slam. Her most productive season came in 1948, when she paced the league with 24 doubles and posted career numbers in average (.292), runs (69), RBI (58), at-bats (399), hits (128) and games played (126), ranking between the top ten in these offensive categories. She helped Peoria reach a 71‚Äì55 record, for the first and only winning season in team's history. It also was the first and only time the Redwings made the playoffs, only to be swept by the Racine Belles in three straight games.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League In 1950, she posted a significant average of .340 with 25 runs and 22 RBI in just only 49 games. She quit baseball again, while she was pregnant with the first of her four children. Fanatics gave her a baby shower on the field. The family moved later to Hollister in Putnam County, Florida, after learning there were six acres and a house for sale. Life after baseball Mary did return to play for three months for a team in Miami, but it never caught on as it had in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball. She and her husband were married for 52 years, until his death in 1998. For more than 20 years she drove a school bus in Putnam County, but she did not give up playing ball, joining in with local women's leagues. Her daughter, Mary Elizabeth, joined her, and they were part of the team that won the state championships for fast-pitch softball in 1975. They finished ninth at the national championship. Nesbitt Wisham was 65 old when she played in that championship tournament held at Louisville, Kentucky. A recreation complex park in West Putnam has been named in her honor.West Putnam Rec Complex Mary Nesbit Park Interlachen In November 1988, Mary Nesbitt Wisham along with her former teammates and opponents, received their long overdue recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York dedicated a permanent display to the All American Girls Professional Baseball League.

The name acknowledges the contribution made by Nigeria to the cost of the squadron's aeroplanes. World War I A 91 squadron was initially formed in September 1917 at RAF Spitalgate but had moved to Chattis Hill within the month to undertake Wireless Telegraphy training. The squadron number was then reallocated in July 1918 to a fighter squadron being formed at RAF Kenley. The new squadron was intended to be equipped with Sopwith Dolphins but never became operational in time and was moved to Lopscombe Corner and disbanded in July 1919. World War II In January 1941 the squadron was reformed from No. 421 (Reconnaissance) Flight and based at RAF Hawkinge, Kent equipped with Spitfires, carrying out weather reconnaissance and Air Sea Rescue operations. In April 1943 they were upgraded to Spitfire XIIs,the first Griffon engined Spitfires, which proved very successful in intercepting the low-flying Focke-Wulf 190s. They also flew reconnaissance missions over northern France and later concentrated on bomber escort duties. In March 1944 the squadron was assigned to the Second Tactical Air Force and flew tactical sweeps over the Normandy landing zones. Later in the year, now based at RAF West Malling, Kent and equipped with the faster Spitfire XIVs they were deployed to combat the V-1 flying-bomb attacks (Capitaine Jean Maridor was blown up in mid-air when he got in too close to shoot a V-1 down Jean Maridor story). In April 1945 the squadron relocated to East Anglia to carry out reconnaissance missions and searches for midget submarines off the coast of the Netherlands and Belgium. Post-war After the war the Squadron moved to RAF Duxford and in October 1946 converted to Gloster Meteors. It was renumbered 92 Squadron in January 1947.

It sought to represent the interests of the 12,000 people who had been conscripted into the Wehrmacht during the German occupation of Luxembourg during the Second World War.Thewes (2006), p. 160 The party tried to claim compensation for those conscripted from the government of West Germany as victims of Nazi Germany. A 1959 treaty between West Germany and Luxembourg, compensating Luxembourg for the German occupation and recognising the legitimacy of the actions of the resistance, was thought by the former conscripts to discriminate against them, who dubbed it the 'Treaty of Shame' ().Thewes (2006), p. 155 The treaty took two years to ratify, after a protracted debate in the Chamber of Deputies and a protest of 10,000 people in Place Guillaume II, in Luxembourg City. The Popular Independent Movement was formed following these popular protests. A generally anti-establishment party without a clear programme on wider issues, it won 5.9% of the vote and two seats in the 1964 election, becoming the first new party since the 1945 election to win a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. The MIP merged with the Democratic Party before the 1968 legislative election. However, one of its deputies, rejecting this merger, created the Party of National Solidarity, which ran and won only 0.4% of the vote and no seats, leading to it dissolving. A later party, Enr√¥l√©s de Force, was established in the 1970s with similar aims, and achieved parliamentary representation in the 1979 election. After the Luxembourg government's official recognition in 1981 that the Wehrmacht conscripts were victims, it disbanded.

He was born in Berlin in the summer of 1886 to a Polish-Jewish mother and German-Protestant father, and died in 1961 in Munich.  The Nietzsche years (1919‚Äì1933)  In 1919 W√ºrzbach founded the Nietzsche Society in Munich.Max Werner Vogel. Chronik des Nietzsche-Kreises: Versuch eine Rekonstruktion. Ed. Beatrix Vogel. M√ºnchen: Alitera Verlag, 2007 Other members soon included writers and intellectuals such as Thomas Mann and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Many European academics of the time perceived a kindred soul in Friedrich Nietzsche and identified with his cultural criticism.Vogel, op. cit. 22. W√ºrzbach's first publication in 1921 was a treatise on Dionysus which rehashed certain elements of Nietzsche's thoughts on the Manichean rivalry of Apollonian and Dionysian forces within cultures. Apart from his doctoral thesis published 1924,where he offered an eccentric theory on prehistoric artifacts and tools,Das Rohmaterial pr√§historischer Silexwerkzeuge nach Vorkommen und Eigenschaften Freiburg i.B., Naturwiss.-math. Diss. v. 5. Mai 1924 his subsequent career was almost exclusively dedicated to his interpretation of Nietzsche. Throughout the 1920s, W√ºrzbach, along with Richard and Max Oehler, worked on the Musarion Editions of Nietzsche's Complete Works. According to a self-penned resume in 1934, and his later mercy-plea to Hitler in 1940, he gave a number of lectures railing against the \\"Jewish philosopher Edmund Husserl\\".Friedrich W√ºrzbach: Bayerische Rundfunk Historisches Archiv (BRHA): Friedrich W√ºrzbach: RV. 16. 30-April-1934; BRHA, 21-May-1940 He claimed to have given lectures on the subject of Husserl in Berlin ‚Äò25, Freiburg ‚Äò26, Basel ‚Äò26, Paris ‚Äò26, Riga ‚Äò28.BRHA 30-04-1934; BRHA, 21-05-1940; Nietzsche Archive Weimar GSA 72/316 Whether in fact these lectures dealt with Husserl in an anti-Semitic manner, as his resume suggests, or whether this was simply the boastings of a pragmatic job-seeker has not yet been established. One thing is certain however, during the 1920s W√ºrzbach drifted toward certain readings of Nietzsche, and philosophy in general, which leaned toward the ultra- nationalist Nazi Weltanschauung which would emerge triumphant in Germany of the ‚Äò30s. It was at the 1924 International Philosophy CongressAtti Del V Congresso Internazionale Di Filosofia. Napoli; Genova; Citta Di Castello: Societa Anonima, Editrice Francesco Perrella, 1925. in Naples where W√ºrzbach first aired his view that philosophers were determined by their race. Thereby, Kant and others were not just \\"philosophical Germans, but Germanic philosophers\\". He was to use this racial argument on numerous occasions throughout his career.cf. W√ºrzbach, 1925, p. 142; NdS, 1933, p. 10; 1943, pp. 7-8; GOR Rather than reading \\"Germanic\\" as related to the cultural influence of one's nation, W√ºrzbach became convinced of a biological-racial reading of Nietzsche. As W√ºrzbach asserted in his 1926 Afterword to the Musarion Will to Power, \\"We proclaim the W.t.P [Will to Power] to be Nietzsche's most important work. We identify as particularly important its biological and regulative character; all that remains is to adumbrate in which sense it is philosophical\\".\\"Nachbericht zum Wille zur Macht\\" in Friedrich Nietzsche: Gesammelte Werke, Musarion Ausgabe 1922-1929. Der Wille zur Macht, Band XIX, 1926, a: p. 406 b:p. 433 He further expounded his biological reading when he claimed that Nietzsche ‚Äòforesaw‚Äô the theory of Keimplasma and identified a \\"spiritual originary-substance,\\" one which \\"eternally grounds life\\" giving the \\"laws of life\\". Keimplasma theory, at least W√ºrzbach's reading of August Weismann's work, was a popular basis for Nazi racial theories at it was argued that through Keimplasma certain racial characteristics, temperaments and values could be passed from generation to generation and remain within a given 'race'.  Nazi propagandist (1933‚Äì1939)  In 1933 W√ºrzbach was appointed to head of World View [Weltanschauung] at the Munich city radio-station [Reichsender M√ºnchen]. This appointment was approved by Joseph Goebbels. According to a 1933 document,BRHA, 19-12-1933 the aim of his shows was to further aggrandize Nazi notions of German racial superiority, beneficent fascism, and of course the thesis of a special destiny for the German ‚Äòrace'.Arbeit und Arbeiter in der neuen Gesellschaftsordnung. 1933; Nietzsche und das deutsche Schicksal, Berlin, Leipzig: Bong & Co., 1933 Although W√ºrzbach was to claim in his Entnazifizierung [de-Nazification hearings] file, that he had been on a \\"secret mission\\"Akten der Spruchkammer: Miesbach 19/1866/46. Dr. Friedrich W√ºrzbach: Rottach, 29-10-1945 to subvert the regime, his published broadcasts, books and articles imply that W√ºrzbach was in fact, at least publicly, deeply enmeshed within the NSDAP doctrine.  Jewish 'victim' (1939‚Äì1945)  W√ºrzbach's attraction to Nazism is all the more curious as W√ºrzbach himself was, in the language of the Nazi Racial-Purity Department, \\"half-Jewish\\".BRHA, 14-9-1939 This was a fact he himself denied by falsely claiming that he had been born to a different mother, whose name his father had never told him, and thus, he urged, he was of ‚Äòtrue‚Äô Aryan stock.BRHA, 21-5-1940 W√ºrzbach was eventually fired from his position at the radio-station when his final plea for clemency, petitioned to Hitler, was turned down. The director of the station, Helmuth Habersbrunner [1899-1959] wrote a number of letters in an attempt overturn W√ºrzbach's suspension, in one such letter to a high-ranking Nazi official, Habersbrunner wrote > \\"When one works closely with someone for six years, one ought to have felt > the Jew coming through on at least one occasion. Especially me, who can > usually sniff a Jew out from a hundred metres, against the wind. I have > never spotted the slightest trace of Jewish Geist. On the contrary, a true > Aryan mentality.\\"BRHA, 27-5-1940 Despite the protests, (there are a considerable number of letters and statements from colleagues trying to reverse the decision in his personnel- file) and despite W√ºrzbach's official \\"Political Judgement\\", which claimed that W√ºrzbach was \\"completely convinced of the world-beating meaning of National Socialism\\",BRHA, circa. 6-10-39 he was finally dismissed in September 1940. In 1943 the Nietzsche Society was officially banned by the Gestapo and their files were destroyed. Although he was prevented from working W√ºrzbach maintained contact with his colleagues and managed to publish number of books, including, shortly before his dismissal, Das Verm√§chtnis Friedrich Nietzsches [Nietzsche's Legacy]. This was collection of Nietzsche's unpublished work, which at the time was described by G√ºnther Lotz, spokesman for the Ministry for the People's Enlightenment and Propaganda as an \\"important work for our current world-view situation\\".BRHA, 16-8-1940 W√ºrzbach's monumental achievement, the painstaking process of assembling and cataloguing Nietzsche's Nachlass, was, however, overshadowed by his continued adherence to the biological-Nazi reading of Nietzsche.  Post war (1945‚Äì1961)  W√ºrzbach escaped prosecution by the Allies after the war. He presented himself to the commission as a victim and was officially given the political all-clear in 1946. He then worked intermittently at the Vocational College [Volkshochschule] in Munich until his death on 14 May 1961. In those final years after the war he repeatedly tried, in vain, to regain regular air-time at the radio station from which he had been dismissed. As far as his philosophy was concerned, he continued to read Nietzsche as proffering a biological-hierarchical theory; as is evident in his claim in an essay written late in 1945, that we need a \\"hierarchy of Man, not according to our own standards, but according to the given hierarchical and power order\\".\\"Das Bild des Menschen\\" in Zwei unver√∂ffentlichen Manuskripte aus dem Nachla√ü.

The Republic of Croatia is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic in Europe at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Southeast Europe. Its capital and largest city is Zagreb. The country is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb. Croatia covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles). Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.29 million. The Croatian Air Force was established on 12 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. After 2003 almost the whole fleet was modernized or completely overhauled.  Early aviation history  Some of the first pioneers in aviation were from Croatia or of Croatian descent.Eler≈°ek L., Homo Volans, rani hrvatski avijatiƒçari 1550.-1925. Rijeka, 2010 Faust Vranƒçiƒá designed and tested the parachute in 1617. First Croat flying in a balloon was Krsto Mazaroviƒá over Zagreb in 1789. David Schwarz created the first flyable Rigid airship. Peter Salcher was the creator of the first wind tunnel. Slavoljub Eduard Penkala constructed the first Croatian two-seat aeroplane in 1909 which Dragutin Novak used for his first flight. Katarina Matanoviƒá-Kulenoviƒá was the first female Croatian pilot. Juan Bielovucic Cavalie was the first pilot of Croatian origin and the founder of aviation in Peru, he enrolled in Voisin brothers pilot school in 1908.Zlatar - Stambuk P., Bielovucic - pionero da la aeronautica Castrense, Lima, 1990 Guido Prodam was the first aviator that flew over the Adriatic Sea in 1911. Other notable aircraft constructors were Rudolf Fizir, Mihailo Merƒáep, Ivan Sariƒá, Stanko Obad and Robert Ludvigovich Bartini.  World War I  During World War I, Croatia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Croatian pilots flew in Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops. Johann Lasi was the first Croatian ace, scoring five victories in only 30 minutes of combat. Miroslav Navratil and Raoul Stojsavljevic were some of the most successful aces in the war, both scoring 10 victories. Viktor Klobuƒçar was the first commander of the Austro-Hungarian naval aviation. He established a naval air force and a network of seaplane bases from Istria to the Bay of Kotor. Major Emil Uzelac was a Croatian military commander who was a leading figure in the air forces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and later in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Independent State of Croatia.http://www.austro-hungarian-army.co.uk/biog/UZELAC.HTM After World War I the Yugoslav Royal Air Force was formed upon the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929) in 1918 and existed until Yugoslavia's surrender to Axis powers in 1941 after the Invasion of Yugoslavia during World War II.  World War II  The Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia came into existence in July 1941. During the war, much of the force's capacity was sent to the Eastern Front as the Croatian Air Force Legion (Croatian: Hrvatska zrakoplovna legija, German: Kroatische Luftwaffen Legion). This consisted of one fighter squadron equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and one bomber squadron equipped with Dornier Do 17 bombers. The fighter squadron served in Russia as part of the German JG 52. Many of the unit's pilots became aces, including; Mato Dukovac, Cvitan Galiƒá, Franjo D≈æal, and many more.Savic, D. and Ciglic, B. Croatian Aces of World War II Osprey Aircraft of the Aces - 49, Oxford, 2002 The Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, the Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr≈æave Hrvatske (ZNDH) came into being as early as 19 April 1941, just nine days after the proclamation of the Independent Croat State. Croatia had a large fleet of relatively modern aircraft during the Second World War usually of German origin, but also ex-Royal Yugoslav, Italian, French, British and Czech. The fleet numbered several hundred aircraft, from training biplanes to the latest Messerschmitt 109 fighters. All ZNDH aircraft captured at the end of World War II were incorporated into the Yugoslav People's Army inventory. On the Allied side, when the Partisan forces started forming their own air force squadrons (based on donated Allied planes, as well as captured ZNDH aircraft) towards the end of the war, a number of Croats with previous flying experience (NDH defectors, USAAF pilots of Yugoslav descent, pre-war civilian pilots), as well as previously untrained personnel, took part in the effort. Most famous unit was the No. 352 Squadron RAF. Founders of the Partisan Air Force were Croatian pilots Rudi ƒåajavec and Franjo Kluz. They both received the title of People's Hero of Yugoslavia.  Modern Croatian Air Force  The Croatian Air Force as it is known now was officially established on December 12, 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence from Yugoslavia. At first, only small agricultural and transport planes, were used to fight a far superior, Serb-led Yugoslav National Army that took almost all aircraft which were, in fact, the property of all ex-Yugoslav states. Some UTVA-75s were fitted with 90-mm rocket-propelled grenades launchers and improvised ordnance like pressurized containers or acetylene tubes filled with explosives, known as \\"boiler bombs\\". A number of Antonov An-2 biplanes used for crop-spraying or leased from parachute clubs were also converted by Croatian Forces to drop makeshift bombs and were used in supply missions to the town of Vukovar and other besieged parts of Croatia.Ripley, Tim (2001). Conflict in the Balkans, 1991-2000. Osprey Publishing, p.7. The main advantage for the An-2 was that they could take off and land on small or improvised airstrips. They were also used to drop supplies by parachute to isolated garrisons. At least one An-2 was shot down on 2 December 1991 over Vinkovci, eastern Slavonia, by Serbian SAM missiles, with the loss of its crew of four. Among the dead was Commander Marko ≈Ωivkoviƒá, the mastermind behind the resupply missions. It is claimed that he developed a GPS navigational system to drop cargoes with an accuracy of 10 metres.Maga≈°, Branka and ≈Ωaniƒá, Ivo (2001). The war in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1991-1995. Taylor & Francis, p. 58. Croatia was eventually able to acquire three MiG-21s (brought over by JNA defectors) by late 1992 when the first fighter squadron was formed. Soon, by evading the embargo on weapons, almost 40 MiG-21bis/UM fighters were acquired. Around 25 were put into service while the rest served as a source for spare parts. The helicopter force was basically created during the war period by purchasing around 20 Mil Mi-8 transports and 10 Mi-24 gunships, which were used to a devastating effect in 1995 during Operation Storm. After the war, many aircraft were withdrawn from service, and modern ones were also obtained, notably 20 Pilatus PC-9 and 10 Bell 206B-3 in 1997. After 2003 almost the whole fleet was modernized or completely overhauled. The air force obtained 16 Bell OH-58 Kiowa from the US in 2016 and 2017 and these were assigned to the Helicopter Squadron at 93rd air Base. Croatia has been attempting to replace its ageing MiG-21 fighters with new western fighters. The country opted to acquire 12 ex-Israeli General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft in 2017 but the sale was cancelled in early 2019 following inability to obtain relevant export approvals from the USA. The MiG-21 replacement program status is currently unknown.

Status Common to locally very common; the dominant plough shell on Atlantic shores. Habitat Sandy beaches along the surf zone, low on the shore from middle tidal zone seawards where the sand is not too coarse. Behaviour When the tide starts to rise, this snail emerges from the sand, spreads its large \\"foot\\" like a sail, and surfs up the beach in response to the smell of carrion. The large foot is also used to burrow into the sand when the tide recedes. Sticks its proboscis into the prey to suck up soft tissues. Often gathers in large numbers to feed on dead and stranded jellyfish and bluebottles. Similar species Various plough shells on the southern African coast look similar, including Bullia rhodostoma on the south coast and Bullia natalensis (pleated plough shell) on the coast of KwaZulu-Natal.

It is composed of six or seven flattened whorls, angular above, and the lowest of which forms of itself half the shell. This body whorl is very much inflated, and furnished externally with thick, longitudinal, distant folds, which are intersected by transverse striae. The upper extremity of each fold is terminated by a conical tubercle, sometimes separated from it by a transverse stria which divides it superficially into two. The upper whorls are convex, loaded also with compact folds and transverse striae. But in these the tubercles are slightly perceptible, and upon some specimens not at all. The white aperture is ovate, and terminates at the summit by an excavated notch at the top of the outer lip, and by a fold of the inner lip. The depth of the cavity is brown or of a violet-color, marked with transverse, whitish bands. The outer lip is thin upon the edge, denticulated in a part of its length, deeply striated internally. The columella is arcuated, covered by the inner lip, which is enlarged upon the body of the shell, and forms a semicircular callosity, often thick, polished, marked at the lower part by transverse guttules, and terminated by an oblique keel, which is prolonged to a point. The color of this shell is generally ash, externally. But sometimes it is bluish, ornamented with one or several transverse, white or brown bands. Another brown band extends always between the tubercles of the body whorl. The operculum is oval and rounded, membranous and denticulated upon one of its edges. This shell, which is very common, often varies in its form. The whorls are more or less elongated, the longitudinal folds and the transverse striae, sometimes completely disappear upon the body whorl, nevertheless, tubercles remain which cover this shell, and the furrows at the base, which are very well marked. The coloring varies equally, some specimens are entirely white. Others are of a uniform reddish or chestnut color. The young of this species have folds and striae much more prominent. In them the lip is thin, smooth, and the callosity does not exist upon the columella.Kiener (1840).

Biosynthesis 4-Imidazolone arise from the condensation of arginine residues and 3-deoxyglucosone (R = CH2CH(OH)CH(OH)CH2OH). 3DG is made naturally via the Maillard reaction. It forms after glucose reacts with primary amino groups of lysine or arginine found in proteins. Because of the increased concentration of the reactant glucose, more 3DG forms with excessive blood sugar levels, as in uncontrolled diabetes. Glucose reacts non- enzymatically with protein amino groups to initiate glycation. The formation of 3DG may account for the numerous complications of diabetes as well as aging. 3DG arises also via the degradation of fructose 3-phosphate (F3P). 3DG plays a central role in the development of diabetic complications via the action of fructosamine-3-kinase. Biochemistry As a dicarbonyl sugar, i.e. one with the grouping R-C(O)-C(O)-R, 3DG is highly reactive toward amine groups. Amines are common in amino acids as well as some nucleic acids. The products from the reaction of 3DG with protein amino groups are called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). AGEs include imidazolones, pyrraline, N6-(carboxymethyl)lysine, and pentosidine. 3DG as well as AGEs play a role in the modification and cross-linking of long-lived proteins such as crystallin and collagen, contributing to diseases such as the vascular complications of diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, and aging. 3DG has a variety of potential biological effects, particularly when it is present at elevated concentrations in diabetic states: * Diabetics with nephropathy were found to have elevated plasma levels of 3DG compared with other diabetics. * Glycated diet, which elevates systemic 3DG levels, leads to diabetes-like tubular and glomerular kidney pathology. * Increased 3DG is correlated to increased glomerular basement membrane width. * 3DG inactivates aldehyde reductase. Aldehyde reductase is the cellular enzyme that protects the body from 3DG. Detoxification of 3DG to 3-deoxyfructose (3DF) is impaired in diabetic humans since their ratio of 3DG to 3DF in urine and plasma differs significantly from non-diabetic individuals. * 3DG is a teratogenic factor in diabetic embryopathy, leading to embryo malformation. This appears to arise from 3DG accumulation, which leads to superoxide- mediated embryopathy. Women with pre-existing diabetes or severe diabetes that develops during pregnancy are between 3 and 4 times more likely than other women to give birth to infants with birth defects. * 3DG induces apoptosis in macrophage-derived cell lines and is toxic to cultured cortical neurons and PC12 cells. 3DG and ROS 3DG induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contribute to the development of diabetic complications. Specifically, 3DG induces heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, a smooth muscle mitogen that is abundant in atherosclerotic plaques. This observation suggests that an increase in 3DG may trigger atherogenesis in diabetes. 3DG also inactivates some enzymes that protect cells from ROS. For example, glutathione peroxidase, a central antioxidant enzyme that uses glutathione to remove ROS, and glutathione reductase, which regenerates glutathione, are both inactivated by 3DG. Diabetic humans show increased oxidative stress. 3DG-induced ROS result in oxidative DNA damage. 3DG can be internalized by cells and internalized 3DG is responsible for the production of intracellular oxidative stress. Detoxification Although of uncertain medical significance, a variety of compounds react with 3DG, possibly deactivating it. One such agent is aminoguanidine (AG). AG reduces AGE associated retinal, neural, arterial, and renal pathologies in animal models. The problem with AG is that it is toxic in the quantities needed for efficacy.

Description The length of the shell varies between 18 mm and 35 mm. It is similar to Nassarius arcularia plicatus, but has a more elongated spire, a smooth surface and less flaring columella. The aperture is dark brown with a light band. The ovate shell is inflated, smooth and polished. The shell is of a variable color, bluish ash, reddish or brown, covered with narrow, white, longitudinal lines, irregularly spread over it. A deeper zone surrounds the suture, and two or three others are found upon the body whorl, that of the middle much more marked, and sometimes the only one. The spire is composed of six convex whorls, slightly flattened at their upper part, and crowned by a row of rounded tubercles. The three or four upper whorls are folded longitudinally, and intersected by transverse striae. The aperture is ovate, notched at the top of the outer lip, with a ridge upon the inner lip. The depth of the cavity is brown, and marked with a whitish band. The outer lip is thin upon the edge, crowned throughout its whole length with small, short, and pointed denticulations, furnished internally with numerous transverse striae. The columella is arcuated, covered by the inner lip which extends upon the body of the body whorl in a white, rather thick callosity, loaded towards the base with some slightly apparent guttules, and terminated by small spinous points.Kiener (1840).

The small shell is ovate, conical, rather shining, and pointed. The spire is formed of six or seven indistinct whorls, often ornamented with longitudinal folds, which are rarely continued to the base of the body whorl, and which are crossed by very fine and slightly marked transverse striae. The aperture is white. The outer lip is thick, white externally, and denticulated within. The columella is smooth and shows two guttules at the base. The coloring of the shell is very various. The ground color is generally of a yellowish white. The transverse striae are accompanied with very fine lines, white and of a red bay color. Reddish, or bluish brown spots, intersected with white, form zones upon the upper part of each whorl. At the base, and the middle of the lowest, the brown lines are more marked.Kiener (1840).

Description The length of the shell varies between 20 mm and 35 mm. The shell has a high conical spire and a globose body whorl. The protoconch is cyrtoconoid (almost with the shape of a cone, but having convex sides) with about 3 whorls. The teleoconch contains 7‚Äì8 convex whorls, with a sculpture of fine, regular spiral cords, broader than the interspaces, and with flexuous axial folds, which are rather swollen beneath the suture and make it undulated and channelled. The base of the body whorl contains a strong groove delimiting the outer part of the siphonal canal. The aperture is rounded. The outer lip is somewhat thickened externally although not forming a varix. Inside the outer lip there are numerous denticles elongated in the spiral direction and alternating stronger and weaker. Parietal and columellar edges form a callus with a raised edge. There is a distinct parietal plait present. The colour of the shell is yellowish with a broad subsutural band of darker blotches; the protoconch dark brown; and the aperture white. Distribution This species occurs in the Eastern Atlantic, from southern Portugal to Angola, also off the Cape Verde islands, Canary Islands, Madeira and Lusitanian seamounts. It occurs in the Mediterranean Sea only in the Alboran Sea and off the Algerian coast. It is moderately common in 50‚Äì200 m. Gorringe, Amp√®re and Seine seamounts, rare in 130‚Äì310 m.

Description The length of the shell varies between 15 mm and 20 mm. The thick shell is smooth, ovate, somewhat gibbous upon the back of the body whorl, flattened and widened upon the sides. The spire is short and acute. It is formed of five or six whorls. The aperture is ovate, smooth and white. The interior of the cavity is brown. The outer lip is margined without, smooth within, joining towards the top a large polished callosity, by which the columella and inferior surface of the whorls are entirely covered. The color is olive or of a brown fawn-color and ash, sprinkled with spots or clearer undulated lines. Sometimes one or two transverse brown bands surround the body whorl. The edge of the callosity is always of a more or less deep orange color.Kiener (1840). General species and iconography of recent shells : comprising the Massena Museum, the collection of Lamarck, the collection of the Museum of Natural History, and the recent discoveries of travellers; Boston :W.D. Ticknor,1837 (described as Buccinum gibbosulum) Distribution This species occurs in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea off Greece, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. Use in prehistory The oldest known jewelry in the world consists of two perforated beads made from shells of this species. These were discovered at Skhul in Israel, and were recently dated to between 100,000 and 135,000 years ago. Similar ornaments (some made from Nassarius kraussianus and the bittersweet clam Glycymeris nummaria as well as Nassarius gibbosulus) have been discovered at a number of Middle Paleolithic sites and are considered a key piece of evidence for the theory that early anatomically modern humans in Africa and the Levant were more culturally sophisticated than had previously been thought. In some cases the shells have been transported a considerable distance from the species' natural habitat. One example is the site of Oued Djebbana in Algeria, for example, where an N. gibbosulus bead has been found; this site was at least 190 km away from the sea at the time the shell was used there.

Upon the convexity of this whorl, may be counted nine or ten distant, parallel and transverse lines of a bright chestnut color, sometimes brown, at other times blackish. The spire is composed of eight whorls, the three lower of which are smooth, and the other five marked with small longitudinal folds, slightly arcuated. The ovate aperture is widened towards the base, which is deeply emarginated, terminated above by a small dilated canal, which is formed by a re-entering angle from the outer lip, and a transverse tooth from the left lip. The outer lip is arcuated towards the top, thinner from the middle to the base, and armed in this part with five conical, pointed teeth, the lowest of which are longest. It is ornamented in the interior with a great number of small, very fine transverse striae. The left lip forms a plate which laps over upon the body of the shell, and gives rise to a small projecting keel, which is terminated below by a pointed and oblique tooth, from whence a rounded fold is given out, which is observed to wind spirally into the cavity.Kiener (1840).

This has been emended to granum by Kiener (1834: 22) and most subsequent authors, presumably considering that the correct Latin word for \\"graine\\" (\\"seed\\") is granum. Therefore, the spelling granum must be conserved in application of ICZN art. 33.2.3.1. \\"when an unjustified emendation is in prevailing usage and is attributed to the original author and date it is deemed to be a justified emendation\\". Description The shell size varies between 10 mm and 14 mm The small shell is ovate, pretty thick, reddish, smooth and shining. It is surrounded with interrupted, small, brown lines, more approximate towards the middle of the lowest whorl, and of a deeper color at the base. The spire is elongated, pointed. It is composed of seven slightly convex whorls, surrounded at their upper part by a white band, sprinkled with distant, brown points or spots. The aperture is white. The internal edge of the outer lip is crenulated, the external part forming a smooth, thick callus, of a dull white, which is continued upon the base of the shell even to the columella, which is arcuated and folded at its base.Kiener (1840).
