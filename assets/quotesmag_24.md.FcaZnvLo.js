The band consisted of Gavin Clark (vocals), Paul Bacon (guitar), Robert Brooks (bass) and Dominic Dillon (drums). By the time the CD Crazy on the Weekend was released, the band had already split up. Songwriter Gavin Clark originally met film director Shane Meadows when both were working at the Alton Towers leisure park. Several years later, Meadows contacted Clark to provide songs for the soundtrack to his low-budget film, Small Time. Clark quickly formed a band for the work, recruiting guitarist Paul Bacon and two former members of indie band the Telescopes, bass player Robert Brooks and drummer Dominic Dillon. The band signed a contract with Independiente Records and completed further soundtrack work for Meadows' feature-length debut, Twenty Four Seven. The limited edition Small Time EP and single \\"Monkey Dead\\", led them to the band's debut alnum, Crazy on the Weekend, which was released in 1998. Working with producer John Reynolds (Sinéad O'Connor), the band continued their practice of recording outside a studio environment. Their acoustic-based songs were augmented by washes of strings and organ, earning comparisons to Nick Drake, Tom Waits and Beth Orton.

The distortion is caused when one or more foot of a machine differ in height from the others. This in turn may be due to differences when the machine was manufactured, a squishy footage with oil film etc. between foot and base, a bent foot, or it may be induced by a pipe to which the machine is attached (e.g. a pipe on top of a pump), which prevents the machine from touching all its feet to its base. Soft foot usually gives rise to a 1x harmonic of the rotation frequency in the spectrum when radial (horizontal or vertical) vibration measurements are taken. It can be detected in this way. Similar harmonic 1x is caused by misalignment and looseness. Usually not only will it resemble them, but it also causes misalignment, imbalance and other problems. In fact, it may be loose, not strictly a soft foot. Therefore, a way to tell the difference is needed. To differentiate soft foot from misalignment and looseness, even if it causes misalignment when present, one way is to loosen each foot bolt at a time, while the other three are tight. If loosening one of them reduces vibration amplitude (which would be opposite to what one would expect if the machine was all right and we caused looseness by unscrewing of the bolt), then soft foot was present. Another way to differentiate soft foot from looseness are phase measurements between the machine foot and the base/ground. 180 degrees difference indicates looseness.

These associations are non-profit associations, according to the law in 1901, but with certain limitations: only object of worship and education of their ministers, only individual members (not Association member), minimum number of members etc.. and some benefits, including tax. History The 1905 law made it possible for the religious associations \\"to take care of their expenses, maintenance and public exercise of their religion\\" so they could perform all the missions previously performed only by the four religions recognized by the government constituted under the law of April 8, 1802 (The Catholic, the Lutheran and the Reformed Churches and the Jewish Synagogue). An independent legal entity was needed indeed in order for these religious associations to acquire a property and buildings to be made available for public worship and with respect the public exercise of worship only. This included also the exercise of worship such as the maintenance of the places of worship, the receiving of donations, and the remuneration and the training of ministers. These religious associations are sole responsible for the theological education of their ministers and for the content of their theological training which reflect their belief system. (association cultuelle 1905) Catholicism refused to apply the law in 1905 (It would create later the diocesan associations.) Judaism retained its past structures with Israelite consistories. The Protestant churches thus form the vast majority of religious associations, the associative model presenting the obvious parallels with their traditional presbyterial system of organization. The being and mission of these churches are not yet exhausted in these associations: they had to establish, among themselves or together with other associations only 1901 law that allows them to exercise including self-help and Mission. Legal system=Declaration of a religious association Any association may be declared in the prefecture as an association of worship under the law of December 9, 1905, the Republic does not recognize any religion. The prefect may nevertheless initiate subsequent action for annulment with the Court of First Instance, if the association pursues an unlawful purpose. Legal value of the term cult However the term cult does not carry legal force at the time of the declaration of the association.

Local Association for the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses Clamecy has established three requirements so that an association can be considered religious under the law of December 9, 1905: * It must be devoted to the exercise of religion. * Its purpose must be exclusively religious. It should therefore be limited to the following activities: the celebration of ceremonies for the fulfillment of people united by a common religious belief, some rites or practices; the acquisition, leasing, construction, l 'development and maintenance of buildings used for worship, as well as maintenance and training of ministers and other persons contributing to the exercise of the religion. Thus are excluded cultural activities, publishing, social or humanitarian, that must eventually be another association nonprofit (Act 1 July 1901). * Its statutory purpose as its actual activity must not undermine public order.

The initiator to the meeting was the nationalist organisation the Norwegian Association (Den Norske Forening), which was led by Torfinn Hellandsvik. The newspaper bulletin created shockwaves into the political community. The Progress Party chairman, Carl I. Hagen, had not known that Hedstrøm had participated at the meeting. Hagen immediately quieted Hedstrøm, and distanced himself from the Norwegian Association. Hedstrøm was also stripped of his position as Spokesperson of Immigration Issues. Hagen stated that \\"Hedstrøm has made a big mistake\\", and Hedstrøm withdrew from the public scene. After a few days, Hagen changed his opinion and stated that Hedstrøm had done nothing else than attending the meeting as a private person. It also reached surface that other politicians from the Progress Party, such as Deputy Chairman Vidar Kleppe, and Member of Parliament Fridtjof Frank Gundersen had also attended meetings hosted by the Norwegian Association. According to the newspaper Aftenposten, Hedstrøm had also had long-term contact with organisations such as the Fatherland Party and Stop Immigration. It also became known that the leader of the Norwegian Association, Torfinn Hellandsvik, had been the premise supplier for a parliamentary document about immigration that Hedstrøm had prepared.

It stands on a corner on the west side of the street and the south side of Commonhall Street, and contains a section of the Chester Rows. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The building was originally a town house, then a public house, and is now a shop. Plans for rebuilding it were prepared by the local architect John Douglas in 1873 but were never executed. More modest plans by the same architectural firm, then known as Douglas and Minshull, were submitted to Chester City Council in January 1899. These were amended and then approved in September of that year, and the rebuilding was carried out the following year. At that time the rebuilding was unique in central Chester in that the new building is no higher than the building it replaced. Before rebuilding it had been a public house named the Harp and Crown; after rebuilding it was renamed the Grotto. Architecture The building has three storeys plus cellars. The lower two storeys are constructed in painted sandstone on the front facing Bridge Street and in painted brick on the other front.

The story follows a fictional Iraqi film crew, inspired by the actual crew, that struggles with making a film during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent American occupation. It was the first feature film to be shot in Iraq after the beginning of the Iraq War. Plot summary The title Underexposure is not only a reference to the expired film stock on which the movie was filmed, but a commentary on the lives of a generation of Iraqis who grew up during the Iraq embargo, isolated from the world. In Underexposure, a fictional film crew copes with the frustration and fear of the Iraq War in Baghdad by making a movie. Friends, lovers, strangers, and family members are woven together by the complexities of their new reality. Along the way friends die and they encounter resistance from people who do not want to be filmed. Ultimately the burgeoning efforts to make the best of their gruesome reality end in tragedy. Production Underexposure was shot on expired Kodak film that was bought back from looters in the early days of the American occupation. Underexposure was produced by Enlil Film and Arts, with Producer and Production Designer Majed Rasheed and Executive Producer Furat Al Jamil. Filming began in November 2003 with money that the crew raised by selling their own possessions. Underexposure was the first movie to be filmed in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein and the first Iraqi film in over a decade to not be censored by the Ba'ath party. Filming was finished in April 2004 and the film was released in June 2005 after post-production was completed in Berlin, Germany, with co- producers Tom Tykwer and Maria Köpf of X Filme Creative Pool.

Madelung studied at several German Technical Universities before his service as a pilot in the First World War. After the war he lectured and worked in Germany and the United States, working on a number of significant aeronautical achievements. Madelung joined the Nazi Party in 1937, and during the Second World War was involved with aeronautical warfare research, including work with Wernher von Braun's rocket program. After the cessation of hostilities, Madelung resumed academic work in both Germany and the USA. Madelung's research at the Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland included the effects of high acceleration on the human body. He permanently returned to live in Germany from 1954 until his death in 1972. The second son of his marriage to Elisabeth Emma née Messerschmidt is Wilferd Madelung, a noted scholar in Islamic studies. Early life Madelung's father was Otto Wilhelm Madelung, a surgeon and medical researcher, and his mother was Hedwig Madelung, née Köhler. Education From 1985 to 1907 Madelung was schooled at a Protestant gymnasium in Strasbourg. He volunteered for military service in 1907. Madelung studied at the University of Strasbourg (1907–1908), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (1908–1909), Leibniz University Hannover (1909–1910), and the Technical University of Berlin from 1910 to 1919. He was belatedly awarded a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the Technical University of Berlin in 1919, and was admitted as Doctor of Engineering of Leibniz University Hannover in 1921. WWI service Madelung was trained as a pilot and may have flown some combat missions in the First World War. He was involved with fellow engineer Fritz Haber's deployment of poison gas. In 1915 Madelung was retained as an assistant at the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt\\"—acronym DVL—the \\"German Aviation Laboratory\\". Between the wars=Junkers F. 13 project In 1919 Madelung was a participant in the development of the Junkers F.13, a pioneering all-metal stressed-skin low-wingcantilever wing monoplane. On 13 September 1919, the F.13 was flown to a then-record altitude of 6 750 metres. \\"Vampyr\\" glider Madelung was the designer of the 1921 \\"Hannover Vampyr\\" glider, which has been claimed to be the model for all modern sailplanes. Work in the United States From 1921 to 1924 Madelung worked as an airplane designer in the United States. Return to Germany Madelung returned to Germany and the DVL in 1925. In 1929 he was appointed to the office of director-general of the airplane department and a member of the board of the DVL. In 1937, he joined the Nazi Party, and in the same year was appointed the director of the re-formed Deutsche Akademie der Luftfahrtforschung (German Aviation Research Academy). World War II After the outbreak of World War II, in 1941 Madelung formed the Forschungsanstalt Graf Zeppelin (\\"Count Zeppelin Research Institute\\") with Madelung himself as director. The Institute worked on bombs, torpedo guidance, depth charges, and construction of airplane catapults.Reitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, Madelung was considered an expert in bomb construction. Later in the war, he was involved with Wernher von Braun's Raketenprogramm. Later life After the defeat of Nazi Germany, Madelung resumed academic work at the University of Stuttgart. From 1946 to 1954, Madelung was a visiting scholar at the USA Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, where he was involved with studies into the ability of the human body to bear large accelerations. He left the USA for Germany again in 1954. Personal life Madelung married Elisabeth Emma Messerschmidt in 1927. The couple had three daughters and two sons. Their first son Gero Otto George (born 1928) was a professor for aviation technology at the University of Munich and member of the supervisory board of Bosch AG. Their second son Wilferd Ferdinand (born 1930) was a professor for Oriental Studies at Oxford University and is the author of numerous scholarly works in Islamic studies.

Family  He is survived by his wife, Valerie, and two children, Nik and Jacky.  Work = Radio wave propagation  Barron's work with Henry Rishbeth on radio wave propagation was pioneering in furthering the understanding of how radio waves were reflected at the ionospheric boundary.  Computer science  Barron began his academic career in Cambridge University where he took a PhD in the Cavendish Laboratory. His research involved very early work in computer applications and he was a user of the original EDSAC computer, the world's first stored-program electronic computer to go into general service. After his PhD he joined the Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory and contributed to the development of the EDSAC 2 computer. In the early 1960s, he was leader of software development in the Titan project, a joint effort with Ferranti Ltd to develop a reduced version of the Atlas computer. In this role he led the Cambridge efforts to develop the Titan Supervisor (a multi-programming operating system) and CPL (Combined Programming Language). The Titan Supervisor led in due course to the Cambridge Multiple-Access System which provided a pioneering time-sharing service to a large user community in Cambridge and was also later employed in the Cambridge-based Computer Aided Design Centre. The CPL project broke new ground in language design and application generality, and the resulting defining paper was written by the original development team. CPL was notable for leading to BCPL and hence B and then C programming language. Barron left Cambridge in 1967 to take up a chair of computer science at the University of Southampton where he remained until his retirement in 2000. As a computer scientist, he contributed to many fields as computer science developed into a discipline of its own. At Southampton he continued his almost unique abilities in writing and lecturing. In 2009, on the 60th anniversary of the completion of the Cambridge EDSAC computer, he delivered a seminal lecture on what was involved in programming this pioneering machine in the 1950s. He was one of the founding editors of Software: Practice and Experience, and served as the editor from 1971 for over 30 years. Barron is the author of many texts that explained the emerging subject to generations of students and researchers. With others he published, in 1967, the manual for Titan Autocode programming. In subsequent years Barron wrote texts on Recursive Programming (1968), Assemblers and Loaders (1969), Operating Systems (1971 and 1984), Programming Languages (1977), Pascal Implementation (1981), Advanced Programming (1984), Text Processing and Typesetting (1987) and Scripting Languages (2000). On his personal web page Barron modestly described himself as \\"old-fashioned scholar, relic of the past\\".

Misra was elevated as a Judge of the Supreme Court of India on 30 April 2010. She has passed several landmark and notable judgements in the Supreme Court of India including judgements on conflict of interest in the Srinivasan-BCCI matter, landmark euthanasia judgement - Aruna shaunbaug matter and most recently the Delhi Uphaar fire tragedy dissenting judgment holding the management liable for colossal loss of human lives and directing them to pay heavy compensation to be used for social causes like building trauma center. Misra enrolled as an advocate in the Bihar State Bar Council in 1972 at a time when the legal profession for women in India was rather uncommon and the profession was primarily considered to be a male bastion. Prior to her appointment as a Judge, Misra was also actively associated with the activities of the lawyers and the legal profession and hence was elected as a Treasurer, Joint Secretary, and Member Executive Committee of the Supreme Court Bar Association, several times, which is the premier association of lawyers in the country. High Court judge In recognition of her services and standing as a lawyer for more than 21 years she was appointed a Judge of the Patna High Court in the State of Bihar on 16 March 1994 but soon thereafter was transferred to the High Court of Rajasthan State in view of the then prevailing transfer policy of judges in the Indian Judiciary. While functioning as a judge in the Rajasthan High Court, she held several important assignments as Company Judge, Judge for Arbitration matters, Constitutional matters and was also appointed and continued as chairman of the Advisory Board constituted under the National Security Act. She also chaired as a member of the selection committee constituted for appointment of Civil Judge (Junior and Senior Division). She was later appointed Executive Chairman of the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority, which is a statutory body assigned with the duty of administering legal aid and assistance to the disadvantaged sections of society and also for taking effective and statutory steps for reduction of arrears in the State judiciary. In this capacity, she also worked effectively for checking the social problems which included the effective implementation of measures for checking the incidence of child marriages, female foeticide, exploitation of women and children in various forms and large number of such other social atrocities. Misra had also been invited to participate in the South Asian Conference on invitation of the UNICEF held at Kathmandu (Nepal) on the subject of \\"Ending Violence against the Women and Children\\". In 1998 she also represented India, as a guest speaker, in the Conference of the International Association of Women Judges held at Ottawa in Canada where a variety of issues relating to women and children in the world at large were the subject matter of discussion and deliberations. Chief Justice of Jharkhand High Court After 14 years of successful tenure as a judge of the Rajasthan High Court, Misra was elevated as Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court at Ranchi in the State of Jharkhand on 13 July 2008 and functioned in that capacity till 29 April 2010. As Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court, while hearing PIL matters, Misra passed large number of prominent and effective orders, which resulted in initiation of probe by the Enforcement Directorate against eminent persons involving significant financial implications. In one of the PIL matters while relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of St. Mary's School, New Delhi vs Election Commission of India, the bench presided over by Misra ruled that the school building and the school buses would not be utilized during the elections on any working day as it upsets the routine studies and also hinders the school's administrative work. Treating a letter from Tapasi Choudhary to be a PIL relating to sensitive matter of mysterious death of her daughter Mousami Choudhary, a trainee air hostess of AHA Airhostess Training Institute, Jamshedpur at Hotel Sonnet of Jamshedpur, Misra sitting in a division bench with justice D.K. Sinha directed for CBI probe into the matter and for filing charge-sheet.

The Beginning. Some important information. Kazlaus studied piano and musicology at the National M. K. Čiurlionis School of Art in Vilnius from the age of 6 and continued to the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre, where she graduated with an arts licentiate degree. A professional pianist, Nomeda altered her musical career early in her studies to become an opera singer. Starting as a high dramatic mezzo-soprano, her professional debut was in the title role of Bizet's Carmen, followed by roles of Eboli in Don Carlos, Prezziosilla in La forza del destino, and others. Her current repertoire includes Brünnhilde and Sieglinde in Die Walküre, Elisabetta in Don Carlo, Desdemona in Otello and other roles in the dramatic soprano range. Kazlaus' biggest breakthrough came in Andorra in 2000, during the master classes given by Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé. Having witnessed her performance, Caballe greeted and complimented her: \\"We have a diva, a wonderful voice\\". The encounter led to an artistic collaboration between them, glimpses of which are featured in the documentary Caballe, Beyond Music (Morena Films, 2003) and in Montserrat Caballé 40 anys al Liceu (Fundacio Gran Teatre del Liceu, 2002). She was also a main guest at the Montserrat Caballé prasentiert Stars von Morgen (Franco- German ARTE TV) in 2001.

She has worked with theatre directors Pierre Jourdan, Eimuntas Nekrošius, Michal Znaniecki, Jurij Aleksandrov and others.

She has performed in leading roles and gala concerts at the Ravenna Festival in Italy,Ravenna Festival the Peralada Festival in Spain,Peralada Festival Moscow Spring in Russia, Pergola Opera Festival in Wroclaw (Poland), Usedom (Germany) and other international festivals.

She was always dead center on pitch, even in her exultant battlecry, and her nascent eroticism made one wish to see her future encounter with Siegfried. It was a truly sensuous performance.’ Brendan G. Carroll, Opera Now, July/August 2007, England, after Die Walkure at the Lithuanian National Opera Theatre ‘The soprano Nomeda Kazlaus was especially outstanding with her more than usually human and subtly feminine interpretation of the Brunhilde character, in which she skillfully found enough space to also show the belligerent side of her, not withholding any of the obligatory pinnacles associated with the role.’ Giulia Vannoni, La Voce, July 2007, Italy, after Die Walkure at the Teatro Alighieri during the Ravenna annual festival ‘Nomeda Kazlaus skillfully interprets Brunnhilde; she embellishes the character with her voice, beauty and powerful vitality, while being utmost delicate in conveying all its motherly and daughterly fondness.’ Stefania Bevilacqua, www.ateatro.it, (108) 16/05/2007, Italy, after Die Walkure at the Lithuanian National Opera Theatre ‘However, it was the local artist, Nomeda Kazlaus, who shined through above all the international cast as Brunnhilde.’ Dmitri Morozov, The Culture, April 5–11, 2007 edition, after Die Walkure at the Lithuanian National Opera Theatre, Russia ‘Nomeda Kazlaus successfully tamed the very demanding role of Brunhilde and her performance was one of grandeur.’ ‘A Lecture from Lithuania’ by Gregor Pom, The Pop/Kultura, July 13, 2007, Slovenia, after Die Walkure at the Ljublijana Festival ‘In our opinion, the first Lithuanian Brunhilde, embodied by Nomeda Kazlaus, is a stunning match of the director’s creative vision. The obvious bond between him and the singer as well as the sensitive nature of Nomeda enabled her to create a quality portrait of motherly and daughterly kindness both vocally and artistically.’ Ido Baldasso/Stefania Bevilacqua, The Muzikos Barai, June 13, 2007, Lithuania ‘The impressive debut of Nomeda Kazlaus in the role of Brunnhilde which she appeared in at all five performances calls for an acclaim. Having lived the music of Wagner‘s on the grand stages of Moscow and St.Petersburgh, this solo performer charmed with beautifully polished voice, vibrant with equally qualitative sound in all registers. She also excelled in the interpretation of the character.’ Beata Baublinskiene, The Bravissimo, April 2007, Lithuania ‘With the appearance of Brunnhilde created by Nomeda Kazlaus in the 2nd act one finally witnesses the voice of the genuine Nibelungenlied calibre.’ Renata Baltrusyte, The Face, March 22, 2007, Lithuania ‘The distinctly accurate singing and stage stamina of Nomeda Kazlaus were a delightful surprise for the audience of the Lithuanian National Opera & Ballet Theatre.’ Asta Andrikonyte, The Lithuanian Morning, March 20, 2007, Lithuania ‘It compels me to laud those who assembled the set of soloists of such resounding qualities as the powerful and convincingly dramatic soprano Nomeda Kazlaus (Brunnhilde).’ Rasa Gecaite, The Atgimimas, March 23, 2007, Lithuania ‘The role of Brunnhilde was tamed by Nomeda Kazlaus. <...> The young singer impressed with a very fit shape and culture of her voice as well as consistent and precise acting technique. She displayed a very clear inner vision of the role she was in, strived to reveal the full range of vocal drama. Her most successful and convincing moments both vocally and in terms of theatrical expression were the episode with Siegmund in the 2nd and the finale of the 3rd acts.’ Jurate Katinaite, The Literature & Art, March 23, 2007, Lithuania ‘Nomeda Kazlaus who interprets the role of Brunnhilde owns a remarkably stylish singing manner underlined with perfect articulation.’ Sarunas Nakas, The Guilds Of Culture, March 2007, Lithuania ‘The last act of the opera awards with exceptionally impressive duos of Wotan and his Valkyrie daughter Brunnhilde by Nomeda Kazlaus.’ Joana Giedraityte, The Time, March 16, 2007, Lithuania ‘Nominated for the Golden Stage Cross national award in the category of the Young Artist for the exceptionally startling debut in the role of Brunnhilde in R.Wagner‘s Die Walkure.’ The Bravissimo, April 2007, Lithuania Nomeda Kazlaus (Reviews) as Desdemona in Verdi’s Otello at the International Pergola Opera Festival in Wroclaw, Poland, 2008, reviews 'The famous Lithuania-born opera singer Nomeda Kazlaus was invited to breathe the life of her own into the role of the black vice gerent’s wife. Armed with her lush soprano voice, often pierced with dramatic flares, the singer made a riveting reading into the soul of the kind-hearted Desdemona. One could hear the unconditional artistic devotion, awash with sincerity in the 3rd act during the sad willow ballad Dio ti Giocondi, as well as during the final prayer Era Piu Calmo, Ave Maria. The work she has done calls for acclamation befitting a true diva.' ‘Othello Abandons Cyprus for the Island of Piasek’ by Wilfried Gorny, www.maestro.net.pl, June 19, 2008 'The production was blessed with a wonderful cast of singers, especially the outstanding Lithuanian Nomeda Kazlaus, the owner of the powerful soprano rich in colour and depth.' ‘The Drama of Envy Unfolds in Freezing Cold’ by Bronislaw Tumilowicz, the Przegląd Nr. 26, June 29, 2008 'A truly moving Desdemona was brought to life by Nomeda Kazlaus from Lithuania.' ‘Othello on the Water – press reviews about the first night of the opera’ by Adam Domagala, the Gazeta Wyborcza, June 16, 2008 'A big surprise of this international production was soprano Nomeda Kazlaus who created the role of Desdemona <…>. The suspense she generated grew as the opera progressed and became palpable in the final act when Kazlaus revealed her vocal and artistic prowess in the impressive incarnation of the prayer and subsequent death in the arms of her beloved.\\" ‘Verdi’s Chamber Othello in Wroclaw’ by Magdalena Talik, www.kulturaonline.pl, June 16, 2008 'The Lithuanian soprano Nomeda Kazlaus convinced beyond doubt of the legitimacy of her concept of Desdemona. Hers was the powerful and valorous Desdemona, but also the one that graciously gives in to the force of destiny in the name of love.' ‘The Death Creep’s in on a Freezing Night of Opera’ by Jacek Marczynski, the Rzeczpospolita, June 16, 2008 'Nomeda Kazlaus as Desdemona truly walks in her character’s shoes <…> the stunning scene where she sings of the willow, then the heartrending prayer in the final act hypnotized with sheer beauty and warmth of emotion.' ‘The Drama of Passion’ by Magdalena Talik, the Polska Gazeta Wroclawska, June 16, 2008 'Lithuanian soprano Nomeda Kazlaus (Desdemona) is yet another success of this production. She skillfully integrated and conveyed kindness and honesty on the one hand as well as resolve and devotion on the other, in other words, all the kernel features of Desdemona’s character.'

When she was 4 years old, she was involved in an automobile accident; the severe head injuries forced her to recover in hospital for four months. When she had turned 6 years old, her parents enrolled her at the Goju-ryu karate dojo (training hall) Chusetsu Gifu of Seigokan, under the leadership of Yasufumi Ohno Shihan (8th Dan) to help her regain strength and coordination. Wakai graduated from Kyomachi Elementary School in 1984, Inaba Junior High School in 1987, and Gifu Dai-Ichi Girls' Senior High School in 1990.

Originally, she competed in both kata and kumite (sparring), but after taking a third place in kata at an All Japan tournament, she focused on that aspect of competition. Competitive karate career Unusually, Wakai did not make it onto the Japanese national karate squad until after she graduated from university—the time when most Japanese karate competitors retire from competition to focus on their professional careers. Wakai has identified Suzuko Hamasaki (née Okamura) as her main inspiration. In an interview in 2000, she said, \\"Suzuko Hamasaki is someone I really admire!

The icon measures 65x80 cm. It is worshipped in the St. Nicholas Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the village of Buchyn in the Lyubeshiv district of Volyn oblast of Ukraine. A 15-kilometer long religious procession to the icon of Our Lady of Buchyn takes place annually on May 22, starting at the village of Zarudchi in the Lyubeshiv district. The Blessed Virgin is depicted with her hands folded in prayer and soulful eyes.  History  In the spring of 1706 on the island, among the floodplain of the river Stokhid, the villagers of Buchyn noticed an unusual light radiated by the miraculous Icon of the Holy Virgin. Miraculous healing that began to occur in front of the image of Holy Mother, inspired inhabitants of Buchyn to built chapel on the place of her landing and later a church. During the First and Second World Wars the icon was secreted in hiding place amid impassable swamps. Till 1793 the church in Buchyn belonged to the Russian Uniate Church - (today Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church). Later, from 1794 to 1921, it was a part of the Minsk diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church, from 1922 to 1939 - to Polessie diocese of the Polish Orthodox Church, and from 1944 - to Volyn- Rivne Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church . Since 1990 the church belongs to Volyn Eparchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. Among the priests who ministered near the icon of Theotokos of Buchyn were: Illarion Tsyrilkevych - from 1848 to 1863. Ihnatii Prushynskyi - from 1870 to 1875. Mykhailo Malevych - from 1876 to 1892. Foma Tumilovych - from 1892 to 1895. Oleksii Dankevych - from 1895 to 1900. Vasyl Oberman - from 1900 to 1915. Vasyl Byeloholovik (1893-1926) - from 1922 to 1926. Yevhen Kvacheniuk - from 1927 to 1930. Ioan Lozytskyi - from 1931 to 1933. Mykola Rozdialovskyi - from 1933 to 1935. From 1961 to 1990, due to the termination of Divine Services in the Temple of Buchyn, Icon of the Theotokos witnessed numerous confessions and prayers of the faithful Christians in the church of Derevok village of the Lyubeshiv district. In 1990, the Icon of the Theotokos was returned to its honored place in the Temple of Buchyn village by the Procession. Buchynska Theotokos was stolen from the church by robbers many times, but was returned every time. The last time it was in May 2007. The icon of the Holy Virgin was being restored at the Museum of Volyn Icons in Lutsk from March till May, 2007 by the painter Anatolii Kvasiuk The wooden church, filled with God's grace, float on the waves of Stokhid river for four centuries.  God's blessing through Holy Virgin  1\\\\. Sisters Olga and Yevgenia, in 1995 in a letter addressed to the senior priest of the Buchyn's temple of that time, told the story about healing of their brother Vasyl. Sisters live in Pinsk now. \\"Once a time our mother took our brother Vasylko to the forest. He was one year old that time and he was just making his first steps to kick some bark for weaving. Vasyl began crying loudly and no one was able to calm him. He had been staying in bed for two weeks, even when he was able to go by his own. Our mother was cried because of that grief every day. Three years had passed since that accident, but he didn't begin to go. Once a time our inconsolable mother saw an old man in slumber, who advised her to make the round of 9 yards, to ask wax, to make a candle and take it to Buchyn icon of Mother of God. The women made everything as the old man had ordered. Our mother tearfully asked Mother of God to help her. Vasylko was walking in the house, when the mother returned. All honour to our Queen of Heaven for her grace.\\" 2\\\\. The senior priest of Buchyn, Sergiy Kulchytskyi ,recalled the memories about his life trial, which were written down by his daughter Valentyna. The Theotokos of Buchyn helped him to survive. Sergiy Kulchytskyi 1946 : «It was snowing after in 1938 years after the Protection Mother of God. I got up and went to feed cows at seven o'clock in the morning. While I was going back, my little son was running to me just in a nightshirt. I quickly leaned him up and went to the house. He had measles before it, but rash had passed away. Slavko caught terrible cold then. After a few days the temperature began to rise. We tried to help him at home, asked medical assistant, Demyan, for help, made cupping- glass and gave him milk with honey, but it didn't help. The temperature was 39, then 40 and 40,5. I went to the doctor in Lyubashiv. It was an old , experienced doctor, he was 76 years old. He dressed a warm sheepskin coat and went with us. When the doctor inspected my so, examined his chest , nodded and said: «He has pneumonia-inflammation of the lungs with congestion. His state of the health is very dangerous, you should hope for God. I have done everything possible, have given him milk with honey to drink.» The doctor explained us that Slavko had caught cold because of having measles before it. Slavko felt asleep and temperature began decrease, and it was 38 in the morning, he became cheerful and had a snack. Temperature was decreasing. I felt something bad in my bones and invited deacon Nykon Naumovych and church warden Hnat with his wife. At 5 oclock p.m. the temperature was 35. He was ill,his eyes were closed. At 9 p.m. the temperature was 35 and pulse was remiss. I asked the deacon to check it, because I was very nervous and wasn't able to recognize it. The deacon didn't hear it, too. I wrapped up Slavko in my sheepskin coat, carried him but the breathing wasn't heard. I laid him down, his eyes were closed. Somebody said me to be quiet, because he was dying. I took a candle into his arms, the second one put near icons. I told my wife to go to the church and pray in front of Mother of God. I stayed near our son. She went to the church with church warden at midnight. Slavko had no features of life. It continued till 5 a.m. Suddenly I saw pulsating artery on his neck. He was alive. Nearly 6 o'clock he opened his eyes and whispered «father». We gave him some milk with honey, then some tea. Later, he had good appetite, put on weight and run till summer.» References External links  * Our Lady of Buchyn Category:Ukrainian icons Buchyn ","title":"Theotokos of Buchyn"},{"id":"25838829","text":"La Renaissance was built in Belgium in 1960 as a standard péniche barge to carry cargo along the canals of Europe. Her original cargo was grain and iron ore. She presently serves as a hotel barge, owned and operated by European Waterways. She is one of around 60 barges offering luxury cruises on French waterways. History The barge was built as La Bonne Humeur ('good mood') in 1960, and measures 39 m (128 ft) long by 5.20 m (17 ft) wide. She has a rectangular hull section, bluff bow and a counter-hung rudder, and is effectively the largest-size vessel which can pass through the Freycinet locks in France and Belgium. This corresponds to a potential loading capacity of 350 tons if loading to the maximum draught if 2.20m (a little over 7 ft). In 1997, she was converted to a hotel barge and underwent another refit in 2006. She was purchased by European Waterways in 2007. She was then taken to a boatyard in Belgium for inspection, maintenance and modifications. The hull has two wear strips welded outside the chine which mean the hard wear of rubbing against lock walls will be absorbed by this sacrificial steel strip. Hotel barge The barge was renamed La Renaissance and began operations on the canals of western Burgundy and the upper Loire in May, 2008. She currently has 4 double cabins allowing her to carry up to 8 passengers. She also has separate crew quarters. The crew of five consists of captain and pilot, deck hand and tour guide, master chef, housekeeper, and waiter. She has a top speed of 10 knots, but usually cruises at the canal speed limit of 6 km/h.

He is also a successful solo artist. In Shabak Samech, he was also known by the nickname Mookie D, given him due to the resemblance of his voice to the voice of Mike D of the Beastie Boys. Biography Born under the name Daniel Neyburger (), Mooki broke out into the musical scene in the age of 17, when he formed the hip hop act Shabak Samech with a bunch of friends. The band proved to be successful among the Israeli youth and sold thousands of records. The band was active since 1992 until 2000, and released three studio albums and one live album. The band reunited in 2007 for a short tour across Israel and a new album. After the disbandment of Shabak Samech in 2000, Mooki went on to a successful solo career, in collaboration with his Shabak Samech co-member Piloni (Danny Kark). Mooki's first solo album was Shma Israel (שמע ישראל) which was released in 2001. The band proved to be very successful, sold 25,000 copies and went gold. The album included guest appearances from artists such as Yuval Banai, Kwami and more. Successful singles from the album included \\"מדברים על שלום\\" (Talking About Peace), which was written about the will for peace at the days of the Second Intifada, \\"ילדה סוכר\\" (Sugar Girl) and \\"האדמה בוכה\\" (The Land Cries) which featured Yuval Banai. The same year, Mooki was chosen as Singer of the Year in Israeli radio station Galgalatz's year's end awards. In 2002, Mooki had his big screen debut as an actor when he played a small role in the Israeli movie Broken Wings. In 2003, he had a role in the first season of the Israeli TV show \\"שבתות וחגים\\" (Weekends and Holidays), and in 2004 he had a role in the movie \\"תיאום כוונות\\" (Coordination of Intentions). In 2005, Mooki released his second solo album – Okef Mi'Lemala (עוקף מלמעלה) which was also recorded with Piloni, who composed, produced and arranged all of the songs. The biggest hit from the album was the single \\"עוקף מלמעלה\\" (Coming from Above). Mooki said he was surprised from the success of the album as the album was very different from his previous works and that most songs were not radio friendly. The album was released on a label Mooki and Piloni formed the same year, called Shabak Music. In 2006, Mooki performed vocals on the song \\"מעצבי דעת הקהל\\" (Shape of Public Opinion) on the album Al Ha'Mishmeret by Rami Fortis and Berry Sakharof. In 2007, he performed on a new song with Izhar Ashdot called \\"מטעי הדובדבן של אוקראינה\\" (Ukraine's Cherry Plantations), and on the song \\"החיים\\" (The Life) with Shlomo Artzi. In April 2008, Mooki released his third album Be'emet ve Mikarov (באמת ומקרוב) which was an acoustic album, featuring acoustic renditions of songs from Mooki's two previous albums. The album featured an acoustic cover of \\"לומדת לעוף\\" (Learning to Fly) by Dana Berger, which featured Dana Berger herself. Also in 2008, Shabak Samech, who reunited back in 2007 for a short tour across Israel, released their fourth studio album, Boom Carnival. In the summer of 2009, Mooki recorded a punk rock album with Israeli punk rock band Useless ID. Mooki wrote all the lyrics, while Useless ID frontman and bassist Yotam Ben-Horin was responsible for the music and arrangements. The collaboration of Mooki & Useless ID started performing live shows together since August 2009, with the album released on January 7, 2010, followed by a special release show on January 28, 2010 at the Barby club in Tel Aviv, Israel. Mooki states that the collaboration started when Mooki spotted the band performing live at the Motorola MotoMusic event, and asked the band to collaborate with him, which led to the recording of the song \\"לא רוצה להתבגר\\" (Don't Want to Grow Up), which became the theme song for the Israeli sitcom Ramzor. After the recording of the song, Mooki showed Useless ID frontman Yotam Ben-Horin some more songs he wrote and within days Ben-Horin has arranged the lyrics with his own music into full songs, which led to the band entering the studio with producer Yossi Fine to record a full-length album.http://israelartistagency.com/2009/08/iaa-punk-rockers-useless-id- teaming-up-with-israeli-rappers- muki/http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.shows_item_show,408,208,20177,.aspx Discography=Solo *Shma Israel (שמע ישראל, Listen Israel) (2001) *Okef Mi'Lemala (עוקף מלמעלה, Coming from Above) (2005) *Be'emet ve Mikarov (באמת ומקרוב, Up Close and Personal) (2008) *Lev Hofshi (לב חופשי, Unfettered Heart) (2014) *Yeled Shel Aba (ילד של אבא ההופעה, Father's Son - Live) (2015) w/ Shabak Samech *Shabak ('שב\\"ק ס, Shabak) (1995) *Be'atifa shel Mamatak (בעטיפה של ממתק, In a Candy Wrap) (1997) *Shabak Be'hofa'a (שב\\"ק ס' בהופעה February 20, 1998, Shabak live) (1998) *C'naan 2000 (כנען 2000, Kna'an 2000) (2000) *Boom Carnival (בום קרנבל, Boom Carnival) (2008) w/ Useless ID *Mooki & Useless ID (2010) ReferencesExternal links *Shabak Samech Myspace page *Shabak Samech Facebook page Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli rappers Category:Israeli male singers Category:Israeli singer-songwriters Category:People from Rishon LeZion Category:People from Yavne Category:Israeli Jews Category:Jewish rappers Category:Israeli singers Category:Israeli male singer-songwriters Category:20th-century Israeli singers Category:21st-century Israeli singers Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Mooki (singer)"},{"id":"25838957","text":"Extreme project management (XPM) refers to a method of managing very complex and very uncertain projects. Extreme project management differs from traditional project management mainly in its open, elastic and undeterministic approach. The main focus of XPM is on the human side of project management (e.g. managing project stakeholders), rather than on intricate scheduling techniques and heavy formalism. Extreme project management corresponds to extreme programming. Advanced approaches to extreme project management utilize the principles of human interaction management to deal with the complexities of human collaboration. About XPM As it is known, the software industry is a fast growing domain and in constant development and change. Despite the fact that there are plenty of methodologies and techniques used when it comes to project management, some new, and others that have been used for decades, extreme project management is one of the modern approaches to project management in this industry. Given that requirements are constantly changing and technology is evolving very rapidly, extreme projects move forward very fast and allow for teams to work in shorter timelines, being able to better understand and approve each other's ideas and work.eXtreme Project Management: Using Leadership, Principles, and Tools to Deliver Value in the Face of Volatility, by Doug DeCarlo, Foreword by James P. Lewis, Afterword by Robert K. Wysocki, First Edition, October 2004, WileyThe Extreme Approach to Managing a Project For extreme project management to produce rapid change, it is necessary for all team members to communicate and reach full understanding. This method is used during the project execution and change control process and it is not allowed to be used for overall strategy or project prioritization. Extreme Project Management, 2014 Association of Modern Technologies Professionals To produce project plans, XPM uses a concept similar to rapid application development (RAD) called rapid application planning (RAP). Stakeholders are invited by the project manager to the RAP session where a sequence of steps (including planning the project) is run so that the best decisions are taken.XPM – from idea to realization. Critical approach to the concept of XPM. Synopsis. 2001 Extreme project management contributes to success in three different ways: 1\\\\. With it, you manage the unknown and unpredictable. 2\\\\. It instills desire and confidence among stakeholders and it focuses on gaining and sustaining commitment to the project mission. 3\\\\. It is a holistic approach, based on reality, managed by specialists. Extreme vs traditional project management Traditional project management is defined as an approach which assesses the project through five process groups: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and completion.What is Project Management?, Elaine J. Hom, BusinessNewsDaily Contributor, February 25, 2014 The main characteristics of a traditional project management are: *Few scope change requests *Well-understood technology infrastructure *Low risk *Experienced and skilled project teams *Plan-driven TPM projectsEffective Project Management: Traditional, Adaptive, Extreme, By Robert K. Wysocki, Rudd McGary. August 2003, Wiley Pub. While traditional project management is used for linear work, without any significant changes, extreme project management is ideal for fast-speed projects with unpredictable results. One challenge faced by the traditional approach is that most software development projects' requirements change during the project execution period. Extreme projects are “a complex, self-correcting venture in search of a desired result” (Doug DeCarlo), where requirements are constantly changing throughout the project as a response to environmental factors such as competition, technology, and economic conditions. Extreme projects are characterized by: *Low possibility of failure *Short deadlines *Paramount innovation *Important quality of life Traditional project management utilizes the \\"waterfall method\\", whose purpose is to plan project activity in a straight line. In the traditional approach, each process runs linearly, resulting with what was planned from the beginning.Radical Project Management.By Rob Thomsett. Published by Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle Creek, New Jersey, 2004 The extreme approach, conversely, does not run constantly, instead adapting the project activity during the process, which leads in the final stage to a desired result. An extreme project management life cycle model is one that proceeds from phase to phase based on very limited knowledge of goal and solution. Each phase learns from the proceeding ones and redirects the next phase in an attempt to converge on an acceptable goal and solution.Traditional Project Management vs. Extreme Project Management. An Apples and Cumquats Comparison, by Doug DeCarlo Mindset Fundamental to success on an extreme project is the application of both the appropriate complex method and the required mindset. Mindset is one of the most important and critical factors related to the extreme project management. In order to change the mindset of a team, there are some main rules for extreme approach for project management: *Chaotic project activities are normal *Uncertainty is one of the most common characteristic of an extreme project *Uncontrollable project *Spontaneous changes happen during the processes *XPM increases the security Mindset is defined as “a set of beliefs and assumptions about how the world works” (Douglas DeCarlo). Mindset is the project’s internal programming. A quantum mindset is needed to manage extreme projects in order to provide the project team an opening to change and unpredictability. Extreme project manager A project manager is a professional in the field of project management whose responsibility is to plan, execute and manage any project. An extreme project manager has to complete all duties and tasks at a high-speed level, following the proper extreme project methodology. The first step of any management methodology is that extreme project managers have to meet the client or the project stakeholders. Also, a specific analysis must be made to accentuate the value being provided to the client, emphasizing the benefits the client will gain as soon as the project is over. Extreme Project Management, by Shaun Ajani. Publisher: iUniverse, 1 Jan 2002 The extreme project manager is charged with responsibilities to the organization they represent, to the team, and to the project itself. Necessary skills include administrative credibility, political sensitivity and leadership. The main tasks that an extreme project manager has to fulfill for the project to be successful are: *negotiating *communicating with all parties *dealing with obstacles *keeping a balance between team members and motivating themProject Management: A Managerial Approach, by Jack R.

They first appear in North America, whence they spread to Europe.Jehle 2005  Description  The pantolestids were fish predators with a body length of about and a tail about long. The anatomy of these archaic \\"insectivorous\\" mammals is best known through well-preserved Middle Eocene Buxolestes specimens found at Messel in Germany and a few other less complete specimens, such as the Palaeosinopa found at Fossil Butte in Wyoming, estimated to have reached body weights of up to , making them relatively large early mammals. They had moderately strong canines and multi-cusped cutting teeth supported by the strong jaw muscles to which cranial cavities were adapted. This combination of dentition and muscles has been interpreted as an early adaptation to a hard diet such as clams and snails. Freely articulated forearm bones (radius and ulna) permitted their powerful forelimbs wide rotational movements, while their digits had large bony claws indicating they could dig and build underground dens. Their powerful hind limbs could not be rotated in the same way, but the prominent transverse processes of the first tail vertebra suggest that they used their powerful tails to propel through the water like modern otters. In later pantolestids there is a prominent cranial crest combined with strong spinal processes, indicating the presence of strong neck muscles needed by swimmers that constantly hold their heads above the water surface. The youngest pantolestids known are Gobiopithecus khan and Kiinkerishella zaisanica from the Ergilian deposits of Khoer Dzan, Mongolia. These late Asian forms are thought to be one of the few examples of European mammals dispersing into Asia during the Grande Coupure. Spencer G. Lucas,Kate E. Zeigler,Peter E.

The Institute convenes European universities, media, global businesses, governments and policymakers to develop innovative initiatives and frontier thinking based on scientific evidence to provide evidence-based analysis and advice in governmental and decision-making processes. The organisation was launched publicly in 2009 at the European Parliament in Brussels by the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Michelangelo Baracchi Bonvicini, now Honorary President and President. Mission The mission is to promote a stronger connection between scientists and policy makers encouraging evidence-based policy making and to foster a stronger cooperation between academia and business.  History Carlos Moedas, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Jean-Claude Juncker, Michelangelo Baracchi Bonvicini at the European Commission In 2006 Atomium - European Institute for Science, Media and Democracy was formally founded under the Law of Belgium as International Non-Profit Organisation (Association International Sans But Lucratif). During its start-up, the institute involved more than twenty leading European universities and businesses as its members. Building a large network of political leaders such as Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Felipe González, Tony Blair, Esko Aho, Jerzy Buzek, Jean-Claude Juncker, Angela Merkel. The first Secretary General of Atomium-EISMD was Bruno Le Maire, currently French Minister of Economy. In November 2009 Atomium - European Institute for Science, Media and Democracy was officially launched publicly at the European Parliament. On 9 November 2009 Giscard d’Estaing and Baracchi Bonvicini signed the European Manifesto of Atomium - European Institute for Science, Media and Democracy. On May 18, 2010, Giscard d’Estaing and Baracchi Bonvicini presented the Report on European Research and Innovation 2020 together with the President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek and the European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science Máire Geoghegan- Quinn. The report presented the proposal shared by the members of the Institute to address the European Commission's research and innovation policy In September 2012, during the negotiations regarding the EU budget for 2014–2020, Baracchi Bonvicini and Giscard d’Estaing together with the former prime minister of Spain Felipe González Márquez, jointly signed the appeal \\"For a European Consciousness, For a More Competitive Europe\\" asking EU member states to increase the budget for research and innovation. The appeal was sent to all European prime ministers and head of governments published by numerous European newspapers including Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, El País, Il Sole 24 Ore and The Irish Times.  REIsearch  REIsearch is a non-profit initiative co-funded by the European Commission Nokia, Elsevier, and other Atomium partners. The aim is to connect researchers and policy makers on topics linked to scientific research in order to promote evidence-based policy making. After the launch Jean-Claude Juncker declared: \\"Innovation and new scientific discoveries are improving people's lives and making our economy more competitive. Science should be open and freed from its traditional ivory tower; to be discussed, submitted to critique and fed with new perspectives. That's why I warmly welcome efforts such as the REIsearch initiative to inspire fresh ideas about how to solve some of our society's most pressing problems\\". In the first three years of activity REIsearch has focused on specific subject areas such as Chronic Diseases, in collaboration with European Commission's DG Sante, Next Generation Internet and Digital Skills, in collaboration with DG Connect, reaching hundreds of thousands of European citizens with its media campaigns and surveys.

Ludvig Kristensen Daa (19 August 1809 – 12 June 1877) was a Norwegian historian, ethnologist, auditor, editor of magazines and newspapers, educator and politician. Background He was born as Ludvig Christensen Daae in Saltdal to vicar Christen Daae (1776–1854) and Elisabeth Marie Friis (1785–1865). The family moved to Jølster in 1817. At the age of thirteen, Daa started at the Bergen Cathedral School and took the examen artium later as a private candidate. After a period as a private teacher in Christian Krohg's family in 1828 he enrolled at the Royal Frederick University. Here he was a leader in the Norwegian Students' Society, and sided with Henrik Wergeland in the dispute with Johan Sebastian Welhaven. The group of which Daae was a part celebrated the Norwegian Constitution Day in 1829, a notable event. In 1830 he Norwegianized his name from Daae to Daa. He graduated with the cand.philol. degree in 1834, was hired as a substitute docent for Steenbloch in 1836 and 1837, due to Steenbloch's illness and subsequent death. In 1837 Daa could have been appointed as the new professor, but Welhaven associate Peter Andreas Munch was chosen. In 1840 Anton Martin Schweigaard got another post that Daa wanted, as professor of economics and statistics. Career Daa held multiple jobs; he worked as a state auditor from 1839 to 1851, parliamentary archivist from 1841, columnist in Morgenbladet from 1839 to 1847 and Christiania-Posten from 1848 to 1851, and publisher of the magazine Granskeren from 1840 to 1843. In 1840–1841 he ran afoul with Henrik Wergeland, who wrote the farces Engelsk Salt and Vinægers Fjeldeventyr (both 1841) about Daa. Daa replied with anonymous attacks in Granskeren, whereas Wergeland was convicted of libel. In 1842 Wergeland released the poem Fordums-Venner about Daa. Daa and Wergeland later reconciled. Daa was elected to the Parliament of Norway from the constituency Akershus Amt in 1842 and 1845. He became an important oppositional politician, and among others helped repel the ban on conventicles in 1842. He was also a proponent of ministerial responsibility, the access of ministers to Parliament and the access of Jews to Norway. In his second term he became President of the Odelsting. However, he ran afoul with the socially conservative farmer representatives. He was re-elected in 1848 from the constituency Søndre Bergenhus Amt (now Hordaland), but he was later found to be non-eligible for election from that constituency. While waiting for the next election, he issued the periodical Den norske Tilskuer, and also worked at Christiania Cathedral School. From 1853 to 1856 he was the editor of Christiania-Posten, and in 1853 he was elected to Parliament for the last time, from Christiania. He was not re-elected again, despite trying in every election until 1873. The rector of Christiania Cathedral School wanted to have Daa removed, and in 1862 he was appointed as lecturer at the University. He was promoted to professor in 1866, and had been the director of the Ethnographic Museum since 1863. As a professor, in 1868 he managed to denounce Peter Andreas Munch and Rudolf Keyser's theory on immigration to Norway. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg, and received the honorary degree at Lund University in 1868. He was decorated with the Order of St. Olav in 1866. His works soon became passé, though, as Ernst Sars became the dominating historian in Norway, to quite a degree for political reasons. Personal life Daa lost his wife Julie Christence Augusta Henriksen (1823–1842) in August 1842; they had only been married since November 1840. Daae was married for the second time, in August 1848 to Pernille Kobroe Daae (1821–1911). He was also a first cousin of priest and politician Claus Nils Holtzrod Daae, and a first cousin once removed of jurist and politician Ludvig Daae, historian and politician Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae, customs inspector Iver Munthe Daae and Suzannah Daae Ibsen. He died in June 1877 in Kristiania.

It is the 12th episode from Season 4 and the 77th episode overall. Plot Betty invites Hilda and Justin to stay for dinner after Justin's acting class audition, but they decline. Living alone, Betty realizes that she misses Matt and fears that if something happened to her, no one would know. Though Amanda and Marc live in the same building, they do not interact with her, increasing her loneliness. Meanwhile, Marc is feeling tension working for both Daniel and Wilhelmina, and sees an opportunity to advance his career when he hears that the vacant Senior Fashion Editor position will soon be filled. Betty, attempting to befriend her neighbors, decides to throw a karaoke party. While hanging fliers announcing the event, she inadvertently lets burglars, posing as locked out residents, into the building. After they ransack the apartments, neighbors are justly chagrined by Betty's action. Betty convinces the landlord to install electronic locks on the doors, and uses this as another opportunity to get together with her neighbors. However, her plans to hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the few tenants that bothered to come are foiled by a down beaten Marc, whose submission for the Senior Fashion Editor position was lost when his laptop was stolen during the robbery. As Daniel and Wilhelmina continue fighting, Amanda sends the rival co-EICs to a couples counseling session hosted by Dr. Sparks. The session does not go well and Wilhelmina leaves. Left alone with Dr. Sparks, Sparks tells a skeptical Daniel that Wilhelmina's body language shows signs of sexual attraction to him. Daniel leaves for the elevator and sees Wilhelmina, but as they copy their body movements this leads Daniel to think Sparks is right. Betty, true to her nature, promises to help Marc recreate the material for his submission, prompting her neighbors to forgive her and come to her party. While Betty tends to her guests with Amanda's help, Marc finishes his submission. Betty sets up a karaoke machine, and performs an off- key rendition of R.E.M.'s \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine),\\" when New York City is hit with a blackout. This keeps the new electronic locks from opening, preventing everyone from going to a blackout party that Amanda set up. Additionally, Marc cannot deliver his submission to Mode. At Casa Suarez, Ignacio watches a scary movie, and thanks to the blackout begins to freak out. When he hears someone coming through the door he attacks them with a pie tin. The person turns out to be Bobby, who was checking on Hilda and Justin. While Bobby nurses the bloody nose Ignacio gave him, they start talking, although Ignacio still believes Bobby is a thug. Bobby tells Ignacio that his problem is that he is afraid Hilda and Justin will not need him anymore. Ignacio calls Betty to see if she is okay, and after he learns that she needs someone to pick a lock, he gives the phone to Bobby, who gives Betty instructions on how to open the lock. Bobby apologizes to Ignacio, who admits that he feels a little jealous. By the time Hilda and Justin return, Ignacio and Bobby are friends, but Justin is frustrated that the blackout made him miss his audition. In the elevator Daniel observes Wilhelmina's movements. The blackout traps them in the elevator, prompting Daniel to \\"defuse the sexual tension\\" by kissing her. After he explains the doctor's theory to Wilhelmina, she punches him in the face. They begin hashing out their conflict and Wilhelmina confesses that Marc is the most important man in her life. Daniel suggests they find a way to settle their differences. Arriving at the Meade building, Betty and Marc realize the blackout has probably locked it as well. Marc tells her that he was inspired by her to go for the position, but now he feels he will never move up in the world until Betty urges him to start believing in his abilities. Moments later the power returns. At Marc's desk they find a note requesting he pick up champagne and flowers for the new hire. This stuns Marc, who assumes Daniel and Wilhelmina have already filled the job he wanted. The next day Betty, Ignacio and Bobby attend Hilda's ultrasound only to learn that the baby has no heartbeat, and that Hilda has lost her baby. Back at the house, Bobby tells Hilda that he is still not going anywhere and an excited Justin announces to the family that he has been accepted into acting class. At Mode, Marc shows up at Wilhelmina's office with the champagne and flowers that he was asked to get for the new hire. She tells him that they are for him and that Marc has been promoted to Junior Fashion Editor - Wilhelmina has decided to have Marc work under her again, not because she wants to take him away from Daniel, but because he is the best choice for the job, something that Daniel agrees with. At the apartment, Marc apologizes to Betty and asks if he can come over to her place to watch movies with her, which she accepts. Ratings The episode slipped slightly down from the previous episode, but still placed second with a 3.2/6 overall, a 1.6/5 among 18-49s and 4.59 million watching.

Life  Shortly after her birth, Matilda was sent to Essen Abbey, where her older cousin Mathilde was abbess, Matilda was educated here. It was presumed that Matilda would stay in the Abbey and become an Abbess like her older sisters Adelheid I, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim. However, Matilda lived a different life from her two sisters, she was to marry Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia. According to the Historian Thietmar of Merseburg Matilda's brother Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor did not like the idea of the marriage at first. The family gave the couple large gifts to secure an adequate standard of living. The Empress Theophanu had consented to the marriage. Ezzo then took Matilda out of the Abbey where she had lived. However, Abbess Mathilde had vainly refused to surrender the girl. Later romantic embellishments even claimed Ezzo had previously been secretly in love with the young Matilda. Ezzo took Matilda from the Abbey to marry her. Matilda's mother Theophanu had always agreed to the wedding but Matilda's cousin and teacher Abbess Matilde did not agree to the marriage. Without the consent of Matilda's mother the marriage would not happen with certainty, it is even likely that this marriage was to ensure the power of Otto III. The family had extensive estates in the Lower Rhine and Mosel. Ezzo's mother came from the house of the Dukes of Swabia and so Ezzo laid claims to these lands. Matilda received them out of Ottonian possessions and gave them to her husband. Marriage and children Ezzo and Matilda had married for love and their marriage was very happy. In any case, it was extremely fruitful, with ten children: *Liudolf (c. 1000–10 April 1031), Count of Zutphen. *Otto I (died 1047), Count Palatine of Lotharingia and later Duke of Swabia as Otto II. *Hermann II (995–1056), Archbishop of Cologne. *Theophanu (died 1056), Abbess of Essen and Gerresheim. *Richeza (died 21 March 1063), Queen of Poland *Adelheid (died c. 1030), Abbess of Nijvel (Nivelles). *Heylwig, Abbess of Neuss. *Mathilde, Abbess of Dietkirchen and Vilich. *Sophie, Abbess of St. Maria, Mainz. *Ida (died 1060), Abbess of Cologne and Gandersheim Abbey (founded in 852 by her ancestor Liudolf, Duke of Saxony). Matilda apparently died unexpectedly during a visit to Ezzo's brother Hermann, while Ezzo was held in Aachen, at a meeting of the nobility of Lorraine.

It was established in 1991. On 8 April 1991, NUST opened for the first time with 270 students in three faculties. The number of academic staff was 28.  Academic programs and faculties  NUST has 7 faculties. Each faculty consists of a number of related departments, each offering a degree program.  Faculty of Engineering  The faculty of Engineering offers Bachelor of Engineering Honors degrees in the following programs: * Electronic Engineering * Chemical Engineering * Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering * Civil and Water Engineering * Fibre and Polymer Materials Engineering The programs take a 5-year course, with the fourth year being for Industrial Attachment.  Faculty of Commerce  The Faculty offers four year Bachelor of Commerce Honors Degrees in seven specialized disciplines. Programs are offered for full-time. The third year is Industrial Attachment. *Accounting *Actuarial Science *Banking *Marketing *Graduate School of Business *Institute of Development Studies *Insurance and Risk Management *Actuarial Science *Finance  Faculty of Applied Science  The Faculty of Applied Sciences offers Four Year Bachelor of Science Honors Degrees for full-time students.

The Faculty of Medicine is located at Mpilo Hospital, and the library in the city center.  Administration Block  The Admin Building side This block holds the main administration offices of the university. The burser's department, registrar et al. are found in this block. Every academic department has an office in this bock to facilitate registration and other issues. The Administration block was the first to be constructed on the campus.  Commerce Block  The commerce block was the second building on the campus. The first lecture on campus was in this building. It holds the faculty of Commerce. The building boasts lecture theatres that can contain whole faculties. This makes it ideal for meetings and other activities that require dialogue.  Chemical Engineering Block  This block holds the engineering departments, Chemical, Civil and Electronic. Construction never completed on the buildings, as such there was no official handover of the building.  Applied Chemistry Block  Ceremonial Hall  The ceremonial hall is where graduation takes place. This is the same building where the students write their exams. Any other functions that attract attentions of the whole university all take place in the same hall.  Incomplete buildings  thumb There are other buildings that are still under construction. The buildings are the main library and a shopping mall. Construction is currently on hold, and has been so for several years now.  Harare Campus  NUST has a small facility in Harare. The facility offers seven post graduate degrees, although it is mainly administrative. The offices streamline the payment of fees and registration for residents of Harare.  Student residence  Student residence is offered as on campus residence, as well as city center residence. The conditions at the two locations are generally the same. NUST offers very limited accommodation for students. As a result, most students rely on accommodation as tenants in the nearby suburbs. The accommodation is readily available, but sometimes it costs a fortune to stay close to the campus.  Sporting and other activities  NUST offers several sporting activities. The most notable on campus activities are Inter-Faculty games and the Vice Chancellor's games. NUST is also involved in inter university games, which are held at a national level.  History and controversies  On 19 May 1991, Professor P.M. Makhurane was appointed as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor of the University and soon after that Mr Lameck Sithole and Mr Michael Kariwo were appointed as the first Bursar and first Registrar respectively. By 1 October 1991, there were 270 students, 28 academic staff, 41 administrators, and 11 support staff. On 28 October 1991, the university organized a public ceremony to install its first Chancellor His Excellency Cde R. G. Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe and its first Vice-Chancellor, Professor Phinias Makhurane, and to lay the institution's foundation stone. For the 1992/93 academic year the university admitted an additional 300 students into the first year in the three faculties (Commerce, Applied Science and Industrial Technology). Student numbers grew to over 1200 by 1995. During the same period academic staff grew to 85. On 27 May 1995 the university held its first graduation ceremony at which the Doctor of Technology honorary degree was conferred upon the President and Chancellor Cde R.G. Mugabe. Some graduates from the Faculties of Commerce and Applied Sciences were capped. On 20 July 1995 the university held its second graduation ceremony, where 281 graduands were capped. The first cohort of graduates from the Faculty of Industrial Technology and the Department of Computer Science were conferred with degrees on that occasion. A donation by the Bulawayo City Council of a site 160 hectares in size and the provision of a capital budget by the government has enabled the first construction phase to begin. Work started in March 1992 when the first contract valued at Z$4,6m was awarded to A. P. Gledinning for the bulk earth works and civil engineering construction for roads. Briefs for the building were completed in May 1992. In July 1993 the construction programme started with the award of the first contract to Belmont Construction for the Administration Block. A year later, in September 1994 the second contractor, International Construction Zimbabwe started work on the Faculty of Commerce block. In November and December 1994 work also started on the departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering respectively. Construction of the first student hostel began a year later, in September 1995. Work on the library began in April 1998, followed by the Ceremonial Hall and the Student Services Centre in November of the same year. The university moved to campus on 1 August 1998, to occupy the Faculty of Commerce and Administration Buildings. The first lectures on campus took place in the Faculty of Commerce Building on 17 August 1998. In 2011 NUST faculty of Medicine was closed because it was unable to comply with medical council requirements. The Zimbabwean government went even further by declaring that any diplomas, degrees, or certificates received from the medical school through government funding would be withdrawn until these graduates served the government for the years they received funding. The faculty reopened for the 2013 intake and as of today is currently running. NUST offers degrees in partnerships with other institutions. In 2015, it was announced that the university inked a partnership with TelOne's technical institute. Time and again there has been calls to whether or not the NUST is fulfilling its mandate. One such call assumes the university is drifting away from why it was initially founded. The university is at the forefront as far as the realisation of Zimbabwe's STEM goals.

The station was one of three rail stations in Hackensack, New Jersey, United States, and was located at Fairmount Avenue and Temple Avenue. The Essex Street and Anderson Street stations are also located in Hackensack. The station house was built in 1870 as part of the extension railroad for the Hackensack and New York Railroad on a track extension from Anderson Street in Hackensack. The line became part of the Erie Railroad in 1896 and New Jersey Transit in 1983.  History = Hackensack and New York Railroad  The original alignment of the Fairmount Avenue station dates back to the chartering of the Hackensack and New York Railroad in 1856 by David P. Patterson of Hillsdale and other local investors. Their intent in creating the rail line was to help maintain a steam-powered train line in the Pascack Valley and have future ambitions to build the system northward. Construction on the new long line began in 1866, with trains heading from New York City to the Passaic Street station in Hackensack. Although Hackensack was not a large hub, there were several rail lines serving the city, including the New Jersey Midland Line (now the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad) with stops at Main Street (at the Mercer Street intersection) and at Prospect Avenue. During the 1860s, service was extended to north, terminating at Essex Street. Although most Hackensack and New York trains ended at Passaic Street, service was extended northward on September 5, 1869, when that stop was abandoned in replacement for Anderson Street. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.  Erie Railroad and station discontinuance  The former Fairmount Avenue station in 1911 After the leasing of the New Jersey and New York Railroad to the Erie Railroad, the history of Fairmount Avenue station remained rather quiet, with minor changes to the station building and site occurring over the next seventy years. By 1966, the station building had been sold off by the Erie Railroad for private usage as Barbara's General Store and Gifts. The former team track had already been removed from the station, and only the main southbound track and partial yard remained on site with the platform. The station building was already repainted orange along the wood siding and the windows, formerly a dark green, became white. The station continued service through Hackensack as the northernmost of the three stations in Hackensack. In 1976, Conrail took over service of the former line vacated by the Erie Lackawanna (a merge of the Erie and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroads) and service of the station. By 1980, during partial ownership between Conrail and New Jersey Transit, the Fairmount Avenue station remained as a part of the line, but by the 1982 timetables, was removed from service. The station building, although it does not receive any active service, remains standing in its orange and white paintjob. The station building is now a donut shop.  Station layout and services  The former Fairmount Avenue station was located at the intersection of Fairmount Avenue and Temple Avenue in the city of Hackensack, New Jersey. The building was centered in the middle of Fairmount Park and had access from Temple Avenue, where crossing gates were visible. The three tracks and gravel platform split the station from a large parking lot nearby. There was also a small gravel parking lot on the southern side of the station. To the north of the station was a stone interlocking tower at the intersection with Main Street. The Fairmount Avenue station had a shingled-roof with a large, angled canopy, and a beige wood siding. There was one asphalt platform servicing all three tracks, and the long canopy over the platform was made in similar design to Newark's 4th Street station. The beige wood was also given green window-frames to benefit the look. The station contained two mainline tracks, the northbound one, and the nearby team track. There was also a third track in the opposite side working as a partial freight yard.

It is the first foreign company to import jeans from North Korea.NBC News  Criticism  In December 2007, Noko's founders gave a North Korean delegation two sample pairs of jeans,for inspection at a textile factory in Pyongyang. When Noko Jeans launched the sales of their first collection in December 2009, criticism was aimed at the brand because of the sourcing of jeans from the North Korean regime. The founders of Noko Jeans defended themselves, saying that they had been present at the factory during production and documented it to guarantee that no child labor had been used, and that workers had working conditions that were in compliance with international standards. The controversy prompted the Swedish retail store PUB to withdraw the jeans from their shelves; the PUB spokesperson stated that they did not want anything to do with politics.  Design  The two unisex models were designed in collaboration with fashion designer Julia Hederus. Both models are designed based on the Noko Jeans story. Kara Slim Fit is a tighter model with a regular waist. Oke Loose Fit is more baggy, with a drop-crotch. Oke Loose Fit has a regular waist.  Production  The production were made by a mining company in Pyongyang during the summer of 2009. In total 1100 pieces were made. Each pair of jeans costed 1,500 kronor (£131), coming in two styles- the slim-fit Kara and loose-fit Oke, both of which were made in black denim.  Museum  The pants were sold through Noko Jeans' online store, as well as the Noko Jeans Museum in Stockholm. The Noko Jeans Museum was opened in Stockholm, Sweden, December 5, 2009, when the PUB department store refused to continue selling the Oke and Kara jeans, worried that they would become involved in the current public debate regarding the ethics of selling clothes produced in the country of North Korea. About two weeks later, on December 18, 2009, Noko Jeans opened their own department museum on Södermalm, Stockholm. It was only available for a limited time and the doors finally closed on February 6, 2010.

In the 1870s and 1880s, Svetec was one of the most influential leaders of the so-called Old Slovenes, a national conservative political group in 19th century Slovene Lands. He was renowned as an honest and principled politician, and was praised for his decency and his straightforward, practical attitude to political questions and life in general.Igor Grdina, Slovenci med tradicijo in perspektivo (Ljubljana: Študentska založba, 2003), 127 The Old Slovene leader Janez Bleiweis called him \\"a crystallized Slovene common sense\\".Ivan Prijatelj, Borba za individualnost slovenskega književnega jezika v letih 1848-1857 (Ljubljana: Slavistično društvo, 1937), 72. Because of his failure to take over the political leadership of the party after the death of its leader Janez Bleiweis, also called Father of the Nation, Svetec was mockingly referred in the press to as \\"Stepfather of the Nation\\".Igor Grdina, Slovenci med tradicijo in perspektivo (Ljubljana: Študentska založba, 2003), 127  Life and career Svetec was born in the Upper Carniolan village of Podgorje near Kamnik, in what was then the Austrian Empire (now in Slovenia). After finishing the grammar school in Ljubljana, he enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied law. After graduation in 1853, he worked in the Austrian administration in Croatia. After 1861, he returned to his native Carniola, at first as a senior official in the Austrian judicial administration in Mokronog and Kočevje, and subsequently as a district judge in Brdo. Between 1866 and 1871, he worked in the municipal administration in Ljubljana, and later as a civil law notary in Idrija and Litija. He participated in the Slovene national movement since 1848. He was very active in the discussions on the creation of a literary standard for the Slovene language. He was one of the most vocal defendants of Slovene linguistic and national individuality against pan- Slavism and Yugoslavism. He entered active politics in 1862, when he was elected to the provincial diet of Carniola. In the 1870s, especially after the death of Lovro Toman, he emerged as one of the most influential leaders of the Old Slovene political movement. Against the pragmatism of most of its leaders, Svetec called for an intransigent political action, thus frequently siding with the radical Young Slovenes. Throughout his life, he defended the idea of United Slovenia. He opposed national demands based on historical state rights, and firmly supported the idea of natural right of peoples. After 1881, he was designated as the successor of Janez Bleiweis as the leader of the Old Slovene movement. However, his leadership was rejected by the more conservative factions in the movement. After the mid-1880s, Svetec grew closer to the Slovene liberal nationalists, and finally joined the National Progressive Party. He died at the age of 94 in Litija.

Nirmal Publishers Azim Khan was a half-brother of Dost Mohammad Khan, founder of the Barakzai dynasty. The battle was a decisive victory for the Sikhs against Afghanistan and led to their occupation of the Peshawar Valley.Joseph Greenwood (1844) Narrative of the late Victorious Campaigns in Afghanistan: under General Pollock; with recollections of seven years' service in India. London: H. Colburn. Following their victory, the Sikhs destroyed the Afghan royal court and the fort of Bala Hissar, Peshawar.Moorcroft, W. and G. Trebeck. (1841). Travels in India. ed. Horace Hayman Wilson, rpt, Delhi: Low Price Publication, 2000, v 2, p 337. However, Hari Singh Nalwa soon commenced the reconstruction of the fort.Nalwa, V. (2009), Hari Singh Nalwa - Champion of the Khalsaji, New Delhi: Manohar, p. 228, .  Background  In 1818, Ranjit Singh made an aggressive push against the Durranis, defeating the Kabul Vizier and Muhammad Azem Khan Barakzai he pushed as far as Peshawar, which under the Durrani Governor (and Azem Khan's brother) Yar Muhammad Khan accepted his rule and paid tribute as a vassal. With this victory Ranjit Singh withdrew from the Peshawar Valley leaving a small garrison in a newly constructed fort at Khairabad, modern day Nowshera. This was in turn followed by Ranjit Singh's capture of Kashmir in 1819 from Azem Khan's other brother Jabbar Khan. Angered by his defeats, Azem Khan recaptured Peshawar in 1822, he made a call for jihad against the Sikhs and hurried to Nowshera where Muhammad Zaman Khan successfully destroyed the bridge at Attock, effectively trapping the Sikh garrisons west of the Indus. However Ranjit Singh had already reinforced his forces in Nowshera including general Hari Singh Nalwa with backing from Pashtun tribes loyal to Shah Shuja. These forces successfully repulsed attacks by Pashtun ghazis and Durrani troops at Jahangira and withdrew to Nowshera hoping to link up with Ranjit Singh.  Battle  Ranjit Singh by this point had brought up his army to the east of Hund, on the opposite bank, a lashkar of thousands of fighters led by Syed Ahmad Shah of Buner had started forming. Despite the odds, Ranjit Singh's forces crossed the Indus under fierce attacks. The lashkar then withdrew to Pir Sabak hill where they concentrated their forces and hoped to gain support from the Durrani troops and their artillery under Azim Khan. Azem Khan for unknown reasons, did not cross the Kabul River straight away to link up with the tribesmen. Ranjit Singh realising the situation concentrated his artillery and infantry on the lashkar and left a small detachment under General Ventura to forestall any crossing by Azim Khan. What proceeded was ferocious hand-to-hand fights between the Tribal lashkar and the Sikh Khalsa Army. Finally after the fourth attack, led personally by Ranjit Singh and his personal bodyguard themselves the hill was carried. By the late evening the lashkar realised that Azim Khan had withdrawn from the battle and abandoned his allies. This coupled with the withering attacks by the Sikh artillery, broke the lashkar's resolve and thought willing to rally again under their Pir Ahmad Shah they dispersed in disarray, the Sikh victory was complete.  Aftermath  Swiftly securing Nowshera, Ranjit Singh's forces captured Peshawar and reached Jamrud itself. Destroying the remains of Durrani power, they reduced Peshawar to ruins and secured the Khyber Pass so no Durrani reinforcements could threaten them again. The tribesman of Khattaks and Yousafzais suffered enormous casualties due to the Sikh artillery and the seeming betrayal by the Muhammadzai Sardars led to a lack of trust in the Durranis' word from then onwards. Azim Khan's retreat has never been explained fully, some say he believed his brother had returned to recapture Peshawar at the behest of the Sikhs, others attribute his retreat to cowardice or fear of being cut off by the ferocious Sikh attack. He did not recover from the shock of the defeat and died shortly after the battle. Ranjit Singh's victory was to mark the highpoint of his campaigns, his empire now stretched from the Khyber Pass to the west, to the north Kashmir and to the south Multan.

When completed, the project will help produce of electricity per year and transfer water from the Cajamarca region west to Lambayeque, near Olmos for the reclamation and irrigation of of farmland. The greatest feature and engineering challenge of the project was digging the trans-Andean tunnel as it connects the Atlantic side of the Andes (Amazon basin) with the Pacific side.Olmos Irrigation: A Work For Development (brochure) Peru Bores Through Andes To Water Desert After Century Of Dreams Daily Maverick The Olmos Irrigation Project is the largest of seven irrigation projects in Peru.Reuters Peru bores through Andes to water desert after century of dreams 4 April 2013 \\"The Olmos project, which critics say benefits mostly big agricultural companies rather than small farmers, is the most ambitious of seven massive irrigation works that are turning swaths of desert valleys near Peru's coast into profitable, producing fields.\\"  History and construction  The idea to divert the Huancabamba River to the fertile but arid lands of Olmos was first envisioned in 1924. The hydroelectric component was added in the 1940s and 1950s. Preliminary feasibility studies were conducted in the 1960s by Italconsult, in 1979-1982 soviet engineers from Hydroproject prepared and approved new design Tunnel excavation had been occurring since the 1950s and through the 1970s but work was halted in the 1980s due to a lack of funding. Construction on the project began in 2006 with the dam and Brazil's Odebrecht drilling the tunnel with a tunnel boring machine (TBM). Of the tunnel's total length, is being dug with a TBM. The dam was completed in 2009 and its reservoir began to impound the river. The tunnel was completed on 20 December 2011 with a ceremony attended by Peru's President Ollanta Humala.Peru's Olmos Hydropower Project PEOT Extends Bidding Timetable In June 2010, H2Olmos S.A. was awarded the contract for the irrigation system and it is expected to be operational in 2013.

Project characteristics  The water transfer accomplished by the Limón Dam on the Huancabamba River will divert up to of water a year through the Olmos Transandino tunnel to the Olmos River Valley. The Limón Dam is a high, long embankment dam that creates a reservoir of impounding . Water diverted by the dam is transferred via the tunnel to the Olmos River where it will be used to irrigate of land. From there, water continues down the Olmos River where at two points, it will be used at hydroelectric power stations. At the base of the valley, water will settle in the Palo Verde Reservoir which will have a storage capacity of . The Palo Verde Dam will serve as a diversion dam and shift water from the reservoir to the remaining of farmland.

Raymond Ylitalo, was an American diplomat and the 29th United States Ambassador to Paraguay (1969–1972). Early years Ylitalo was born to Jussi and Saima Maria (née Swen) Ylitalo of Floodwood, Minnesota, on December 25, 1916. Jussi was a first generation immigrant originally from Rautio, Finland, while Saima was a second generation Finnish-American. Jussi was a miner and a grocer in his life in America. John Raymond was one of four children of Jussi and Saima Ylitalo who survived to adulthood. After graduating from Floodwood High School, Ylitalo attended Suomi College in Michigan before completing undergraduate studies at St. Olaf College, from which he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1937. He then attended Northwestern University, from which he obtained a Master of Business Administration degree the following year. He then went on to be an instructor in commerce at the University of Alabama from 1938 to 1941. In 1941, he became a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he served until he joined the United States Foreign Service in 1946. Diplomatic career Since he was of Finnish ancestry and spoke fluent Finnish, Ylitalo's first assignment in the Foreign Service was as a political attaché at the United States Embassy in Helsinki, where he served from 1946 to 1950. Later he became the assistant chief of the State Department's Security Division; in this post, he was in a position where the Defense Department asked him to evaluate The Pond's material, to which he responded that he \\"could describe it in only one word, 'crap.'\\" From 1954 to 1958, Ylitalo served as Consul General in the United States Consulate in Munich. He then served from 1959 to 1962 as the United States Consul General in Manila, Philippines, in which capacity he, on March 6, 1959, reported to the State Department concerning \\"Conditions Affecting Cultural Presentations in Cebu\\". He opened the American Consulate in Cebu City, during his tenure in Manila. He was Director the State Department Visa Office in Washington from 1962 to 1968. He was appointed Consul General of the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1968, where he served one year before his ambassadorial promotion. Ambassador to Paraguay Ylitalo was appointed Ambassador to Paraguay by President Richard Nixon on July 22, 1969, and presented his letter of accreditation to Alfredo Stroessner on August 14 of that year. Within sixteen months of Ylitalo's assumption of the mission in Paraguay, a major point of contention in Paraguay – United States relations came to light when two pounds of heroin were seized at Miami International Airport, aboard a plane from Paraguay in December 1970. Narcotics came to dominate the remainder of Ylitalo's tenure as Ambassador, becoming a topic that was always discussed in his conversations with Paraguayan officials. In April 1971, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs successfully infiltrated the smuggling operation and found that Auguste Ricord was controlling the operation, which had smuggled five thousand kilograms of heroin into the United States between 1965 and 1970. The Paraguayans detained Ricord, but, much to the dismay of the United States, refused to extradite him. With the Paraguayan refusal to extradite, the embassy responded by expressing \\"profound disappointment and concern with the decision of the court\\", noting that \\"the accused is one of the heads of the international heroin trafficking industry, who has brought misery and death to thousands of youths in the United States and around the World.\\" President Nixon threatened, in January 1972, to cut off foreign aid to Paraguay if Ricord was not extradited, but Paraguay still did not relent. With the Paraguayan refusal to extradite Ricord, Ylitalo was coming under fire from the American press for being too close to Stroessner. When he noted that there was insufficient evidence to directly connect Stroessner and others in the regime to direct participation in drug trafficking, the attacks against him from the press increased in their severity. Unable to secure Ricord's extradition and increasingly becoming a target for media attacks, Ylitalo was recalled by President Nixon on September 11, 1972. Life after the Ambassadorship Following the termination of his mission in Paraguay, Ylitalo was appointed to the U.S. Consulate in Toronto, in 1973. He served there as Consul General until his retirement to Washington, D.C., in 1976. Ylitalo died of cancer on February 10, 1987, at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C.

The MG 11 has a narrow constructive relationship with the German MG 08 heavy machine gun. History The MG 11 was based on the water-cooled Maxim machine gun, which had been developed by Hiram Stevens Maxim in 1885. The MG 11 was the last of a series of Swiss derivatives of the Maxim machine gun.  7.5 mm Maschinengewehr Modells  1894 (MG 94) = Maschinengewehr Modell 1894 on its knee mount. Between 1891 and 1894 Switzerland procured 72 heavy machine guns, designated MG 94, from Maxim and Nordenfelt in London . These weapons were issued to fortress troops and mountain troops and were operational until 1944 as spare arms with the Territorial Battalion. The MG 94 was mounted at the front end and at the rear on the knees of the gunner. Two leather padded rings on the left and on the right sides of the breech of the weapon rested on the knees of the machine gunner sitting behind it and permitted sweeping fire. The machine gun MG 94 was chambered for the 7.5x53.5 mm GP 90 cartridge and was later, along other minor technical modifications, adapted for firing the more powerful 7.5x55 mm GP 11 cartridge. Six MG 94 had their water-cooling mantles drilled and cut open, making these guns air-cooled and thus water-free and lighter for use as aircraft machine guns. These 6 MG 94 air-cooled guns were taken out of service in 1944. = 1900 (MG 00) = Maschinengewehr Modell 1900 on its tripod. In 1899 Switzerland procured 69 heavy machine guns, designated MG 00, mainly from Vickers, Sons & Maxim in London. These guns had tripod mounts designed for cavalry use with a gunner's seat attached to the rear support strut. The machine gun MG 00 was chambered for the 7.5x53.5 mm GP 90 cartridge and was later adapted for firing the more powerful 7.5x55 mm GP 11 cartridge. = 1911 (MG 11) = Mg 11 on fortifications mount The MG 11 at first was originally procured from DWM Berlin. As German deliveries ceased during World War I, the manufacturing of the MG 11 was taken up in 1915 by the Eidgenössischen Waffenfabrik W+F (confederate weapon factory W+F) Bern.Am Rhyn, Michael und Reinhart, Christian: Bewaffnung und Ausrüstung der Schweizer Armee seit 1817, Band 14, Automatwaffen II, Maschinengewehre, Sturmgewehre, Minenwerfer. Zürich 1983. S. 228 The MG 11 was a water-cooled heavy machine gun and mounted on a tripod. It was chambered for 7.5x55 mm GP 11 ammunition and came into service with the army, cavalry and was also used in fortresses, tanks and on airplanes of the Swiss Army. When applied in a fortress an optical sight and ball armoured screen was applied, the water cooling was connected to a tank and a sealing rubber was mounted behind the muzzle to prevent the penetration of flamethrower oil into the bunker. 1934/1935 modernization programme In 1934 and 1935 the MG 11 machine guns were adapted for using then modern metal machine gun belts that started to replace the canvas belts used by the original Maxim machine guns. A flash suppressor at the muzzle was also introduced. Further a new trigger system was fitted that allowed one handed firing, so the gunner could simultaneously operate the sweeping fire control wheel at the tripod, and additional kit for anti aircraft usage. The modernized MG 11 machine guns were marked with a white stripe running along the length of the cooling sleeve. Beginning in the early 1950s the MG 11 was gradually replaced by the air-cooled 7.5 mm Maschinengewehr Modell 1957 (MG 51) general-purpose machine gun. The replacement process was finished in the 1980s.

His pamphlet, \\"An Account of the Growth of Deism in England\\" (1696), provides some information on early English deism, which he describes as an unintended consequence of the foreign education of young gentlemen. He claims that, when they return home, the trappings of the Church of England remind such men of the powerful Catholic Church they were warned to distrust. In this way he linked the lack of religious tolerance with the growth of religious skepticism. On 30 January 1700 he was asked to preach the traditional sermon before the House of Commons of England in memory of Charles I. (He had delivered a sermon on the same occasion six years earlier, before the Lord Mayor.) He omitted the prayer for the King and Royal Family, and his comments, which included a suggestion that the sermons be discontinued, resulted in a vote of censure. The text was reprinted in 1752. A later pamphlet, \\"A Letter to the Author of the Memorial of the Church of England\\" (1707), resulted in a fine of 100 marks, and he narrowly escaped time in the pillory.

Nerdcore.de. Retrieved 2011-06-20. Plot summary The journal-style book is written as a partial \\"secret\\" diary of Abraham Lincoln, kept by the 16th President of the United States and given to the author by a vampire named Henry Sturges. Years later, the manuscript is found in a five-and-dime store in the town of Rhinebeck, New York (a reference to Smith's wife's hometown). When Abraham Lincoln is only eleven years old, he learns from his father Thomas that vampires are, in fact, real. Thomas explains to his son that a vampire killed Abraham's grandfather (also named Abraham Lincoln) in 1786. Young Abraham is also shocked to learn that his beloved mother, Nancy, succumbed not to milk sickness but rather to being given a \\"fool's dose\\" of vampire blood, the result of Thomas's failure to repay a debt. Lincoln vows in his diary to kill as many vampires as he can. A year later, he lures the vampire responsible for his mother's death to the family farm and manages to kill it with a homemade stake. In 1825, Lincoln gets word of a possible vampire attack along the Ohio River and investigates, but this time he is no match for the vampire and is nearly killed. He is saved at the last moment by the intervention of the vampire Henry Sturges. Henry nurses Lincoln back to health and explains some of the nature of vampirism, emphasizing that some vampires are good, such as he, and others are evil. Lincoln spends the summer with Henry sharpening his senses and being trained as an expert vampire hunter. Henry sends Lincoln the names and addresses of evil vampires; Abraham dutifully tracks them down and kills them. As a young adult, Lincoln and a friend travel down the Mississippi River to New Orleans on a flatboat to sell a number of goods. Here, Lincoln's life is changed forever after he witnesses a slave auction. Lincoln follows a slave buyer and his new slaves back to their plantation and discovers to his horror that the buyer is a vampire; the slaves are to be used not for labor but for food. Lincoln writes in his journal his belief that vampires will continue to exist in America as long as they can easily buy their victims in this manner; to end slavery is to end the scourge of vampires. Lincoln becomes an abolitionist. Lincoln returns to his home in New Salem and begins his business and political careers by day, continuing to track down the vampires in Henry's letters at night. His life is once again tinged by tragedy when his fiancée Ann Rutledge is attacked and murdered by her ex-fiancé John McNamar, now a vampire living in New York City. With Henry's help, Lincoln catches McNamar and kills him, but he decides to give up vampire hunting and instead concentrate on his daytime pursuits. Lincoln marries Mary Todd, begins to raise a family, starts a law firm and is elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives. While in Washington, Lincoln meets his old friend Edgar Allan Poe, who also knows the truth about vampires. Poe tells Lincoln that the vampires are being chased out of their ancestral homes in Europe (in part because of a public outcry over the bloody atrocities of Elizabeth Báthory) and are flocking to America because of the slave trade. Poe warns that if the vampires are left unchecked, they will eventually seek to enslave all Americans, white and black. Lincoln leaves Washington in 1849 and declines to seek re-election; Poe is found murdered that same year in Baltimore, the victim of a vampire attack. In 1857, Henry summons Lincoln to New York City. Here, Lincoln and fellow vampire slayer William Seward are told that the vampires in the South intend to start a civil war so that they can conquer the north and enslave all humans of America. Lincoln runs for the U.S. Senate and debates Stephen A. Douglas in what became known as the Lincoln–Douglas debates. Although Lincoln loses to Douglas (an ally of the Southern vampires), he gains a great deal of publicity and respect, which allows him to capture the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States and then the office itself. Lincoln's 1860 presidential election triggers the secession of the southern slave states and the start of the American Civil War. His former opponent Douglas also sides with him, regretting his previous alliance with vampires. Early battles, such as the First Battle of Bull Run, go poorly for the Union troops after they are attacked by Confederate vampires. Lincoln decides that the best way to defeat the vampires is to eliminate their food source and starve them out; to that end, he announces the Emancipation Proclamation and encourages the slaves to fight back against slave owners and vampires alike. This begins to turn the tide of the war. However, the war takes a personal toll on Lincoln. A vampire assassin sneaks onto the White House lawn and kills Lincoln's son, Willie. Henry appears at the White House and offers to turn Willie into a vampire so that he will \\"live\\" again, but Lincoln is unwilling to allow it, despite being very tempted. Enraged, he banishes Henry and all other vampires from the White House and refuses to speak to any of them ever again. The Civil War ends with the Confederacy's defeat. Lincoln receives reports that the vampires in the South are fleeing to Asia and South America in the wake of the slave system's collapse. Happy for the first time in many years, he attends a play at Ford's Theater, only to be assassinated by actor John Wilkes Booth. Booth expects the vampires to rally around Lincoln's death but instead finds himself shunned and hiding in a Virginia barn as Union troops arrive to arrest him. Henry arrives and confronts Booth inside the burning barn, killing him. After Booth is killed, Lincoln's body is brought by a funeral train back to Springfield, Illinois, where Henry stands guard. 98 years later, during Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, both Lincoln and Henry attend and Lincoln writes about spending the previous night at the White House as a guest of then-current president John F. Kennedy (and how the monument dedicated to him gives him \\"no shortage of discomfort\\"). Henry had used his powers to turn Lincoln into a vampire, believing that \\"some men are just too interesting to die\\". Reception The Los Angeles Times gave Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter a positive review, noting that \\"a writer who can transform the greatest figure from 19th-century American history into the star of an original vampire tale with humor, heart and bite is a rare find indeed\\". Time magazine gave the novel a mixed review, calling author Grahame- Smith \\"a lively, fluent writer with a sharp sense of tone and pace\\", but finding the novel \\"a little too neat\\" and noting that \\"once the connection is made, it feels obvious, and neither slavery nor vampirism reveals anything in particular about the other. One could imagine a richer, subtler treatment of the subject, in which the two horrors multiply each other rather than cancel each other out\\". The premise of the novel is close to, and apparently inspired by, Queen Victoria: Demon Hunter, published the year previously by A. E. Moorat. Film adaptation 20th Century Fox produced a film adaptation, released June 22, 2012. Timur Bekmambetov directed the film, Tim Burton produced along with Bekmambetov and Jim Lemley, and Benjamin Walker starred as Abraham Lincoln.  Sequel  A sequel, titled The Last American Vampire and focusing on Henry Sturges's experiences during many major events of the 20th century, was released on January 13, 2015.

The 3920th SW was a non-flying ground service support element for the 7th Air Division (AD) of Strategic Air Command (SAC), based at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, in the United Kingdom. It was established on 1 December 1952 as the 3920th Air Base Group. When activated, the wing assumed the resources (Manpower, Equipment, Weapons, & Facilities) of the 7503d Air Support Wing, which had been established on 25 May 1951. Throughout its existence it was controlled by Strategic Air Command and served as the host for deployed SAC bombardment, strategic reconnaissance, and air refueling units. Strategic Air Command Support The group, which was upgraded to a wing in 1964, provided host station support functions primarily for SAC B-47 / RB-47 Stratojet and KC-97 Stratotanker elements deployed to RAF Brize Norton during REFLEX deployments from United States bases. It was organized when SAC assumed responsibility to support its deployed elements from United States Air Forces Europe )USAFE) in 1952 and was responsible for managing the Brize Norton Task Force, Provisional. Special weapons support was provided by the 4th Aviation Field Depot Squadron (later 4th Aviation Depot Squadron) from 1951 to 1956 and by the 2nd Aviation Depot Squadron (later 2nd Munitions Maintenance Squadron) after 1956. These squadrons were assigned to the 7th AD, but attached to the wing. On 1 July 1960 an RB-47 (53-4281) deployed from the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Forbes AFB, Kansas was shot down by the Soviet Air Forces while operating from the 3920th at RAF Brize Norton.

Storylines Alex arrives in Walford in March 1997 as the local vicar. He runs a homeless shelter called Bridge House with the help of Christian follower Sarah Hills (Daniela Denby-Ashe), despite protests from many of the residents in Walford. Alex falls in love with Kathy Mitchell (Gillian Taylforth) while her marriage to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) has begun to crumble. Alex and Kathy break up when she leaves for South Africa, ignoring Alex's pleas to stay. A while later, Alex leaves the Square to work in a mission in Somalia. In 2019, he attends his sister Mel Owen’s (Tamzin Outhwaite) funeral off-screen. Creation and development His first major television role, Driscoll was sent to audition for EastEnders by his agent and following a screen test was given the part of vicar Alex. His first scene was with actress Daniela Denby-Ashe who played Sarah Hills. He has reflected, \\"I was really chuffed. But that soon turned to fear when I had my first scene with Daniela. It was so nerve-racking. I didn't really understand the set-up. I don't know how I got the words out.\\" Alex's most notable storyline is a love affair with Kathy Mitchell (Gillian Taylforth) who is married in the serial to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Discussing the storyline, Driscoll suggested that Alex had been \\"wracked by emotional and spiritual turmoil ever since\\" sleeping with Kathy. He added, \\"Alex has got a lot of conflict. He's been suggesting to his father that he should work at his relationship with his wife - but there he is having an affair with a married woman. He feels a bit of a hypocrite - he feels guilty and ashamed. But the inescapable fact is he's attracted to Kathy. Something strange and wonderful happens to him when he's around her.\\" Driscoll quit the role in 1999, claiming that it had always been his intention to stay for only a few years: \\"I felt it was the right time to go. I'd learnt a hell of a lot. The pace and the turnover is incredible. It has been brilliant but I'm an actor and I want to do different things [...] When I finished, the whole cast gathered to clap me off the set. I felt it was an ending and it was sad. It was emotional because it was my first major role and there were things to prove. But it's time to move on.\\" Reception A popular character with female viewers, Driscoll claims that he received \\"loads of fan-mail from women and would get stopped in the street by people who told him: 'If you were my vicar, I would go to church.\\" The character came under criticism in 1998 following his affair with Kathy Mitchell. One vicar complained that the BBC were portraying Christian characters as \\"jokes or frauds\\". Gillian Taylforth, who played Kathy, reportedly had reservations about the plot too as she feared Kathy sleeping with a vicar would cause a negative response from viewers.

The bridge is a steel, pin-connected, nine-panel, overhead, Pratt-truss highway bridge. Constructed in 1901, it is among the state's earliest remaining examples of the overhead Pratt type. The bridge also is significant for its association with Lawrence Henry Johnson, a prominent Minnesota bridge builder of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This bridge is one of only two authenticated surviving examples of Johnson's work.  Construction  Although Amboy stood only about one-half mile east of the river, there was no nearby highway bridge. A road did enter Amboy from the west, but it crossed the river at a shallows known as Dodd Ford, which apparently was often an obstacle to vehicular traffic. In the fall of 1900 the Blue Earth County Board of Commissioners decided to have a bridge built at that location. The official county surveyor N.F. Brooks prepared the preliminary design documents. The local contracting firm of Carlstrom Brothers built the two stone piers. At that time bridge building in Minnesota was dominated by six Minneapolis companies: Gilette Herzog Manufacturing Company (a subsidiary of the American Bridge Company), William S. Hewett and Company, Minneapolis Bridge and Iron Company, L. H. Johnson, M. A. Adams Bridge Company, and Hewett Bridge Company. Although the last two firms did not bid on this project, the others did and their proposals were within a few hundred dollars of each other, ranging from $2948 by L. H. Johnson to $3320 by the Minneapolis Bridge and Iron Company. The contract went to the lowest bidder, L. H. Johnson. As the contractor, Johnson undoubtedly turned to an established bridge fabrications shop, possibly the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company, with which he had been associated earlier. Completion was required by June 1, 1901, and he apparently delivered the bridge on schedule for he was paid in full on June 6.  Significance  The Dodd Ford Bridge is one of only two surviving bridges known to have been built by Johnson while he operated as a contractor under his own name. In its design and engineering it is a conventional, pin- connected, nine-panel, , steel truss of the overhead Pratt variety. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this general type of truss was commonly used throughout the United States for highway crossings of approximately 90 to 150 feet in length. Reflecting the prevailing bridge- engineering practices of its time, this bridge has relatively light construction by later automobile-inspired standards. The bridge employs laced channel sections for vertical compression members, paired eyebars for horizontal tension members and lower chord members, angle sections for overhead sway bracing and portal bracing, and crossed eyebars for top-lateral and bottom-lateral bracing. The bridge further evokes its period by virtue of its narrow roadway with a plank deck supported on wood stringers. Such design was later prohibited by the Minnesota Highway Commission (established in 1905). The Commission advocated a 16-foot minimum roadway, steel stringers, and preferred a reinforced-concrete deck.  Status  The Dodd Ford Bridge survived for most of its life with minimal alterations. The Blue Earth County Highway Department repaired some cracking of the north abutment during the 1970s and reinforced, by welding and bracing, a few collision-damaged members of the east web during the 1980s. In April 1993, however, the bridge suffered severe substructural damage when high water undermined a portion of the south abutment and swept away the southeast wing wall. The county immediately closed the structure and made plans for its replacement. The bridge was closed to heavy traffic for thirty years before it was closed to all traffic in May 2009. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2009. The Preservation Alliance of Minnesota placed it on its 2010 list of the 10 Most Endangered Historic Places. The Dodd Ford Bridge was rehabilitated, and reopened to traffic the summer 2016. Since the original abutments were in poor condition, the truss, or metal, portion of the bridge was lifted off the original abutments and placed on temporary supports while the contractor rebuilt new abutments. New I-beams were placed on the new abutments and the historic truss was placed on top. The new supports will help the over 100-year-old bridge carry modern traffic loads, while maintaining its historic character.

With the fall in price of eggs and poultry, Annalee wanted to see if she could make money selling her dolls again. The Thorndikes sold off a section of the poultry farm and used the profits to create a small line of skier dolls. The line was a success, and slowly the Annalee doll \\"Factory in the Woods\\" was born.

These dolls were on display at the Eastern States Exposition in Springfield, Massachusetts, and at the Rockefeller Center in New York City, both to advertise the state. These promotional dolls were extremely popular; so popular in fact that by 1960 Annalee dolls were being sold in stores in forty states, Canada, and Puerto Rico. In 1964, the day-to-day operation of doll making became too big for the Thorndikes' house. At this time they moved the operations out of the house and into a \\"factory in the woods\\". Over time, the factory expanded to eventually fill over fourteen acres of land dotted with seven buildings containing of space.

Bridge from eastbound I94 Onramp bridge History The utility of constructing a cross- town expressway through Detroit was recognized as early as the 1920s. Planning continued off and on through the early 1940s, when the state began anticipating post-war projects. Originally called the \\"Crosstown Expressway,\\" the Detroit City Council approved a petition to rename the proposed stretch the \\"Edsel Ford Expressway\\" in April 1946. The Edsel Ford would ultimately require the construction of over 70 structures, of which the US-12 bridges are two. Work began on the freeway in 1948, starting on the Detroit–Dearborn border, with the US 12 bridges being the first structures opened for bidding. The firm of Darin & Armstrong won the construction contract with a bid of $925,000, and began work in August 1948. The bridges were completed by August 1949. A ribbon cutting ceremony, presided over by State Highway Commissioner Charles Ziegler, was held on August 17. Description Of the two bridges, the span over I-94 is the longer. The shorter span over the westbound I-94 ramp is long and wide. The bridge has eighteen stringers, more closely spaced in the center of the deck to support what once was a streetcar line. Channels are laid over and riveted onto the stringers. The railing, installed in 1967, has a precast base and horizontal pipe.

The Windows Mobile version was released in Japan in November 2009 and in North America in January 2010. That same year, versions for Wii and Nintendo DS were published by Namco Bandai Games in Japan, by Xseed Games in North America, and by Rising Star Games in Europe. The game was ported and released for iOS in October 2012 and Android in August 2013. Gameplay=Concept The objective in the game is to lead the character, Ivy, a newly born bird, to her lost mother. The game is similar to Kirby: Canvas Curse because the player does not directly control the main character. In the game, Ivy is constantly moving directly right or left, unless presented with something in her way, in which case she turns around and moves the other direction. The player takes advantage of this by drawing lines to guide the chick away from danger and to the goal. The player can make ramp lines to have Ivy walk up or down, make vertical lines to reverse her direction, or pull the vines and slingshot Ivy in a given direction. Ultimately, the player must lead Ivy away from obstacles such as spikes or rats and to the end goal. The game features several different modes. The main game is where levels are simply played in order. Another mode lets the player play any level that has been previously played in the main game to try and beat the high scores. There are also two different ways to play multiplayer. One is the competitive multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete to see who can get their Kiwi to the goal the fastest, the tricky part being that any player can interact with any other player's Kiwi as well. Separately from this mode, at any point, up to four players can choose to play cooperatively to help the first player in the main game. According to lead designer Yuji Naka, there are various reasons that the game's unusual title has a question mark. Reasons include piquing curiosity in potential players to pick up the game, as well as playing a role in the game's story regarding Ivy's identity. Version differences The Wii and Nintendo DS versions offer the same basic gameplay and level designs, with the main difference being the controls. In the Wii version, the player points at the screen to draw vines, while in the Nintendo DS version the player uses the stylus. The original Japanese version of the game had a more muted color scheme, while more colorful backgrounds were added in the international releases at the request of publishers. The full retail versions of Ivy The Kiwi? for the Wii and Nintendo DS have 100 levels, while the mini version available for DSiWare only has 50 levels. While the game originally began development as a WiiWare game, that version was cancelled as Yuji Naka began adding more features and ideas.\\"Postmortem: Ivy the Kiwi?\\", Game Developer Magazine, January 2011 Reception The game received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Gaming Trend's Mike Repella praised the innovative use of the Wii remote controller, stating \\"I suspect that when Yuji Naka set out to make Ivy the Kiwi he wanted to make game for the Wii that actually used the Wiimote to create a classic style game. To that end I think he succeeded.\\" Official Nintendo Magazine gave the DS version a score of 70% and called it a \\"fun platformer with a twist, held back by a lack of ambition and some frustrating later levels\\". 411Mania gave the Wii version a score of 7.7 out of ten and said it was \\"a good diversion for people needing a short break from bigger games. The levels are short and look great while playing, yet offers a bit more by collecting feathers. However, even with the feather collecting it won’t take you long to find everything.

Liam Adams was a criminal case relating to allegations of child abuse made in 2009 against Liam Adams, brother of Irish politician Gerry Adams. Liam Adams was found guilty in October 2013 of 10 offences, and was sentenced in November 2013 to 16 years in prison. UTV Insight Special In December 2009, a UTV Insight Special programme alleged that Liam Adams had sexually abused his daughter, Áine Tyrell, for a decade. In response, his brother Gerry Adams urged Liam to turn himself in to the police. Gerry also alleged that his deceased father, Gerry Adams, Sr., had subjected family members to emotional, physical and sexual abuse. The Police Service of Northern Ireland issued a European Arrest Warrant for Liam Adams’ arrest. Extradition request In December 2009, Liam Adams presented himself at a Garda Síochána police station in Sligo. They were not able to arrest him as they did not have the necessary European Arrest Warrant. Adams did not wish to hand himself into police in Northern Ireland, citing unfairness. On 3 March 2010, the High Court in Dublin endorsed the European Arrest Warrant, which was issued in Liam Adams' name by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The following day, Adams handed himself over to the authorities in the Republic. Adams opposed his extradition. At a brief hearing on 21 July, Adams applied for legal aid to help fight the extradition. On 3 October 2011, an Irish High Court judge in Dublin declined Liam Adams' objections to the extradition request and said he would issue an order for Adams to surrender to the authorities in Northern Ireland. On 18 October 2011, after losing his appeal against extradition, Adams was remanded in custody for 15 days to a Dublin prison. He was handed over to officers from the PSNI at the border on the night of 2 November, and brought to Laganside Magistrates Court on the morning of 3 November, where he was remanded in custody for a week. Trials There were two trials; the first collapsed in April 2013 for legal reasons. Verdict In October 2013 Liam Adams was found guilty of ten offences, including rape and gross indecency committed against his daughter between 1977 and 1983 when she was four to nine. On 27 November 2013, Adams was jailed for 16 years with a further two years probation. He died in prison 25 February 2019.

Early life Alice Mabel Bacon was the youngest of the three daughters and two sons of Reverend Leonard Bacon, pastor of the Center Church in New Haven, Connecticut, and professor in the Yale Divinity School, and his second wife, Catherine Elizabeth Terry. In 1872, when Alice was fourteen, Japanese envoy Mori Arinori selected her father's home as a residence for Japanese women being sent overseas for education by the Meiji government, as part of the Iwakura Mission.Methodist Episcopal Church, 286-87 Alice received twelve-year-old Yamakawa Sutematsu as her house-guest. The two girls were of similar age, and soon formed a close bond. For ten years the two girls were like sisters and enhanced each other's interests in their different cultures.Takagi, p. 78 Education and career Alice subsequently graduated from high school, but was forced to give up hopes of attending university due to economic circumstances. Nevertheless, she was able to pass examinations for a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard University in 1881, and received a post in 1883 as a teacher at the Hampton Institute. In 1888, Alice received an invitation to come to Japan from Yamakawa Sutematsu and Tsuda Ume to serve as a teacher of the English language at the Gakushuin Women's School (Peeresses' School) for Japanese girls from aristocratic families. She returned to Hampton Normal School after a year. Hearing that one of her students wanted to become a nurse but was refused entrance into training schools because of her race Ms. Bacon sought to establish a hospital at the Institute. With the help of General Samuel C. Armstrong, Hampton's principal, enough funds were raised to construct the Dixie Hospital. The hospital which opened in May 1891 provided nursing education as well as medical care for the surrounding community. Friends meet again: Tsuda Umeko, Alice Mabel Bacon, Uryū Shigeko, Ōyama Sutematsu (from left to right) In April 1900, she was invited back to Japan to help establish the Joshi Eigaku Juku (Women's English Preparatory School), which was the forerunner of Tsuda College, staying until April 1902. During most of this period, she assisted Tsuda Umeko on a voluntary basis, refusing monetary compensation except for her housing. Alice remained single all of her life, although she did adopt two Japanese girls as her daughters, Umeko's niece Watanabe Mitsu, and Hitotsuyanagi Makiko, with the latter subsequently married William Merrell Vories in 1919. Based on her experiences in Japan, Bacon published three books and many essays, and eventually came to be known as a specialist of Japanese culture and women. Her last teaching was at Miss Capen's School for Girls at Northampton, Massachusetts from 1908 and ended in 1910. Death Alice died in her hometown at New Haven, Connecticut in 1 May 1918 at the age of 60. She was buried at the Grove Street Cemetery.

(November 19, 1904 - January 23, 1969) was an American architect who turned in mid-career from his traditional architectural education to the Modern or International style and was one of its first practitioners in Texas. Early life Arthur Herman Kilian Fehr was born to Herman Benno Fehr and Selma Ottilie Kilian Fehr in Austin, Texas. He was the second of three sons and reared in lower-middle class, ethnic surroundings. His father was a barber and barber supply salesman. Though both parents were native-born Americans the household language was German. The social focus was the extended family of their local Lutheran church. Education and early career In his teens Fehr wanted to be a chemist. But a drafting teacher in his vocational school, noting his ability at sketching and cartooning, encouraged him to try architecture, and he enrolled in the University of Texas architecture program. After receiving his degree in 1925 he worked for architect Harvey P. Smith in San Antonio. Smith's work was in the Beaux Arts and Spanish Colonial styles, and under him Fehr worked on the first building of Lutheran Concordia College of Texas (now Concordia University). This was Kilian Hall, named for his own maternal great-grandfather, Jan Kilian, the pastoral leader of a group of Wendish immigrants to Texas in 1855. The building's design was later cited by the Architects' Guild of Texas, and for Fehr this was an early taste of peer recognition. In 1926, on the urging of his university professors, Fehr left Texas for New York and worked as a draftsman for Kenneth M. Murchison, whose better known designs were in the Beaux Art tradition. He also took a short and pennywise tour of England and the Continent during the summer of 1927, from which he returned (in his own words) \\"[a] better American and a much better Texan\\". While in New York he attended night courses at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, Columbia University and New York University. He returned to San Antonio in 1928 to work as chief draftsman and designer for Smith on various projects ranging from the officers club at an Army air base to the restoration of San Antonio's 18th- century Spanish Governor's Palace. In 1931 the Depression interrupted his progress, but after two years of infrequent work he rejoined Smith in the survey and initial restoration work on San Antonio's 18th-century Spanish mission of San José y San Miguel de Aguayo. This led to Fehr, at age 29, being offered the position of park architect-foreman for the National Park Service (NPS) at the beginning of 1934. He was assigned to the new Bastrop State Park project near Austin, part of the state's nascent parks system in the era of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). From 1934 to 1937 he designed, supervised and participated in the construction of all the structures there as well as at the adjoining Buescher State Park near Smithville. These were in the proscribed \\"rustic\\" or \\"pioneer\\" style favored by the NPS at that time. He also designed and supervised the making of furniture and other decorative fittings used not only at Bastrop but throughout the Texas parks system. Other than some early student commissions Bastrop was the first work of Fehr's to be executed in his own right, and it was soon noted. In Park and Recreation Structures, originally published by the NPS in 1938, the author Good commented that the Bastrop guest cabins \\"add up to a total effect that is extraordinarily individual and attractive\\". [reprint of 1938 edition published by National Park Service] In the fall of 1936, towards the end of Fehr's tenure with the park service, came also his first published foray into \\"modernism\\": a modest picnic table with a space frame of copper and brass plumbing and a concrete slab top. In his 1938 NPS book Good noted that it was \\"novel rather than revolutionary\\" but also an example of \\"some recent experimentation [within the parks service]…loosed from the fetters of tradition to acknowledge the claims of new materials and methods\\". In 1997, Bastrop State Park was designated a National Historic Landmark. Of the hundreds of CCC park projects under the New Deal, it is one of only five so cited to date. Return to Austin By late 1937 Fehr had completed the bulk of the Bastrop work. Though offered a new position in the NPS as a furniture designer, he resigned in early August of that year and opened his own practice in Austin. This first office was in the back of the studio of the Swiss-born woodcarver Peter Mansbendel, whom Fehr had met in the 1920s through the Austin Saengerrunde, a German singing club. Fehr's first commission was the First English Lutheran Church in Austin. The design was entirely in the Mission style with interior carvings by Mansbendel. But Fehr was pulling away from Mission and Rustic architecture towards modernism. In particular he admired Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus. The emphasis on craft, economy of construction, the use of readily available materials and strictly functional design echoed both the austerity of his upbringing and his experience in the early Depression as well as his recent work at Bastrop and his associations with Mansbendel, the ironworker Fortunat Weigl, the cabinetmaker Emil Schroeder and other local craftsmen. And at Bastrop in 1935 he had met a kindred spirit in 22-year-old Charles Granger, a fresh University of Texas architecture graduate who briefly worked as his assistant that summer. At the end of 1937 Granger returned from California, where he had been working for Richard Neutra, and hired on with Fehr's new practice in Austin. Fehr's search for clients willing to attempt this unprecedented style of work and living resulted in a church and a few Austin houses such as those designed and built for the Dr. & Mrs. D. K. Brace (1938) and for Dr. & Mrs. Carl Fehr (Fehr's brother, built in 1940), as well as for Dr. & Mrs. Charles Darnall (1941). Another result was the \\"St. Elmo-Tel\\", an exercise in the growing trend of \\"mo-tels\\", in this case fronting on the highway to San Antonio south of Austin. It appeared in the October 1941 issue of Architectural Record (AR), the first of Fehr's modern efforts to be published in a national magazine. The editors of AR cited it as \\"one of the most newsworthy\\" of architect-designed answers to \\"the serious need for this new type of accommodation\\". It featured large expanses of metal-framed glazing, pipe columns, exposed brickwork inside and out, and flat concrete slab roofs—a Bauhaus outpost on a Central Texas highway serving a uniquely modern American function. It was an early example of what would be the hallmark of Fehr's work, in partnership with Granger, after WWII: a distinctly spare and \\"industrial\\" look, admitting abundant light and ventilation, and treating economy of construction not as a limitation but as merely another design element. And it also featured one \\"regional\\" addition to this otherwise European-influenced design: a fireplace, exterior wall and chimney in rough-cut limestone, the \\"rustic vernacular\\" employed by so-called rock-layers in the Austin area since the city's beginnings a hundred years before. In 1938, Fehr married Mary Jane Grant of San Antonio, whose father Albert W. Grant was managing editor of the San Antonio Express. With the start of WWII Fehr closed his office. Too old to enlist (he had just turned 37), he served with the Army Service Forces, traveling around the Southwest inspecting military structures and in some cases filling in as an ad hoc interpreter for German prisoners-of-war at various prison camps. Post-War practice Back in Austin in late 1945, Fehr and Granger established a partnership in that name (often shortened to simply \\"F&G;\\") committed to \\"the practice of progressive architecture\\". Success soon followed. Residences and a church were published in Architectural Record in 1946 and 1947. By the Spring of the following year they had received their first national award—one of eight Mentions out of one hundred entries—in the second annual awards competition of the modernist periodical Progressive Architecture (P/A) in whose pages they would appear regularly from that time on (see \\"Partial List of Published Work\\" below). Although they designed residences, clinics, and various other commercial and institutional projects, educational and church structures later were the core of their best-known work. F&G; made the Texas climate, where \\"air- conditioning\\" was yet to be practical or affordable (especially in school construction) a central consideration. They spread their school buildings out into multiple wings with large aluminum awning windows for light and ventilation . And they used such \\"cool\\" structural elements as pre-stressed concrete beams and interior walls of glazed structural clay tile—novel and inexpensive applications at the time, especially in Texas. The name of the school, stated in Neutra's iconic aluminum letters floating on a plain brick wall, was typically the only architectural decoration. This economy of expression and cost extended to their other work. And F&G; shared with many other early American modernists—architects and industrial designers alike—the ideal of developing a design ethic peculiar to their region, thus producing something American and not merely imitative of Europeans. For Fehr that meant local limestone rockwork inside and out. Floor coverings, walls and exterior sunscreens were fashioned from structural tile fired from the deep red clay of D'Hanis in South Texas. Casement and awning windows were of aluminum. Exterior wall surfaces and even sun shades were often simply gray asbestos-cement panels, either flat or corrugated and impervious to the rigorous Texas climate. The results tended to be too ascetic for some tastes. Fehr's own residence, built in 1949, was featured six years later in a House Beautiful article introduced as \\"How to Learn from a house you may not Like\\" (with photographs by Ezra Stoller). F&G; was a collaborative design practice, and both partners worked with their junior associates on their firm's designs. Indeed, their own early houses (Granger's was completed in 1952) offer little to distinguish one hand from the other's beyond Granger's preference for brick over Fehr's rough limestone. But Fehr had been raised in a deep Lutheran tradition, and he took primary interest in F&G;'s church designs. Among the better known of his work today are two campuses for the Episcopal Diocese of Texas: St. Stephen's Episcopal School in the hills to the west of Austin (1953) and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest (1954) in the city itself. The chapel on each campus is a particularly Fehr design. The first is essentially a stripped-down Mission form, drawn from his pre-modern beginnings. The latter is less formal and more intimate, with floor-to-ceiling stained-glass windows of his own design. It was by his own admission his favorite work. At the height of its success F&G; was profiled in a P/A article of August 1958 (part of the magazine's series on \\"The Architect and His Community\\"). The sixteen-page article \\"document[ed] the phenomenal growth\\" of the firm and described the firm's history, organization, methods, and design philosophy. A year later Texas Architect, published by the Texas Society of Architects (T.S.A.), expanded on this in its February 1959 issue, outlining the process that led to two P/A awards in 1959. The more significant of these was the \\"Design Award: Commercial\\" given for Austin's new terminal building at Robert Mueller Municipal Airport. From their earliest association before WWII until their deaths in the late 1960s Fehr and Granger undertook more than 1,000 projects,F&G; business records. private family holding and carried a staff of as many as twenty people, nearly half of them registered architects. With the death of Granger in an automobile accident in 1966, Fehr's workload escalated. Less than three years later a respiratory illness led to pneumonia and heart failure, at age 64. Awards and honors * In 1953 Fehr was selected to lead an architects' tour of West and East Germany under the combined aegis of the American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) and the Bund Deutscher Architekten (B.D.A.), sponsored by the West German government, to observe post-war reconstruction efforts. * In 1957 Fehr was elected to the College of Fellows of the A.I.A. in recognition of his design work, and from that date he used the title \\"Arthur Fehr, F.A.I.A.\\". (The younger Granger also received his Fellowship a few years later.)* * In 1960 Fehr was a juror for the R. S. Reynolds Memorial Award given to the Swiss architect Jean Tschumi. Chief among the other four jurors was Fehr's own architectural exemplar, Dr. Walter Gropius. * Keenly interested in the new architecture of Latin America, in particular its exotic concrete structures, Fehr was also given an Honorary Fellowship in La Sociedad de Arquitectos Mexicanos (1963). * Along with his other professional and civic duties, Fehr served as Secretary-Treasurer, Director, Vice-President and, in 1963, President of the Texas Society of Architects. * As a practice F&G; received many national, state and local design awards including those cited above. NotesPartial list of published work Books:  * Periodicals:         Other sources * * Note on sources *The bulk of original sketches, preliminaries and working drawings still in existence are in the Arthur Fehr Collection at the Austin History Center, Austin, Texas. This includes work by Arthur Fehr and Fehr & Granger. *Another significant source of original drawings is the Alexander Architectural Archive, part of the Architecture and Planning Library at the University of Texas at Austin *The current reprint edition (Princeton Architectural Press) of Good's Park and Recreation Structures, cited above, is in large quarto format with more than six hundred pages and photographs of a far greater number than that. As in the original 1938 edition no attribution is given to any of the hundreds of creators of the works pictured, nor is there an index. As explained in the \\"Acknowledgement\\" to the 1938 edition by NPS Assistant Director Conrad L. Wirth: \\"there was regrettable lack of information to make possible rendering due credit to the many able planning groups, and individuals, earnest artisans and mechanics, responsible for the structures herein illustrated. For this reason, it has seemed fairest to all concerned to credit the material, with few exceptions, to locations rather than to individuals or groups. A kind of equalization of injustice to all has seemed preferable to a discriminatory injustice to some.\\" However its plenitude of photographic documentation makes it very useful, as long as one knows which park to look for. And there is sufficient other evidence (ex.: see Parks For Texas, etc. above) that the structures, furniture and fittings at Bastrop and Buescher State Parks from 1934 to 1937 were Fehr's designs and made under his direction. There is one documented exception: on page 23 of Part II (specifically, Plate II A-14) are a photograph and drawings of a wooden picnic table at Bastrop State Park. This appears to be the same table that Fehr, in an entry in his day book for November 4, 1936, credits to Olin Boese, another NPS architect working primarily at Lake Corpus Christi State Park. (Boese may have also been the first architect of the Bastrop State Park \\"Refectory\\"). Presumably this picnic table design was made at the Bastrop furniture shop central to the entire Texas parks system. Fehr did also note in own \\"day book\\" (see above) that there was briefly a landscape architect posted there. Finally, Graber Kidwell, formerly a member of the Texas A&M; Corps of Cadets and later a Brigadier General in the U. S. Army, also appears frequently in Fehr's day book. He was posted to Bastrop as a civil engineer and thus had a hand in various structures and facilities there.

He was born in Hilversum. After Veronica was forced to stop, one of the DJs of the station, , formed the Veronica Omroep Organisatie: a legal entity that grew out from a candidate broadcasting organisation to the largest broadcaster in the country.NOS Journaal , 26 December 2003. Watched: 29 June 2012  The Veronica brothers  Bull is one of the three initial brothers that formed together the management (and ownership) of the offshore radio station Veronica. From 1960 the offshore radio station transmits from a former German lightvessel the \\"Borkum Riff\\" and in 1964 the three brothers decide to buy a larger trawler that was destined for being scrapped: the Norderney. Bull is the founder and driving force behind offshore radio in the Netherlands: he develops the business model for commercial radio in the Netherlands. Initially Bull, with his brothers Jaap and Dirk were in the textile trade. He realized that the existing Dutch public broadcasting system didn't appeal to the younger generation. The youth listened to foreign stations, such as Radio Luxemburg and Verweij decided to start an offshore radio station. Radio formats that are now common place, such as \\"horizontal programming\\" were introduced by Verweij. He also introduced advertising on radio in The Netherlands: the public radio stations in those years were completely funded by the state and it was not possible for companies to reach out to the public via national radio-stations. Bull Verweij is seen as the initiator of commercial broadcasting and modern radio formats in The Netherlands.Telegraaf: Radio pioneer Bull Verweij dies, 19 Februari, 2010. Visited: 29 June 2012  Controversy on Mebo II  Another radioship was the Mebo II: the owners of Veronica had also invested in this ship when their owners Meister and Bollier needed extra cash, but with the deal that the Mebo II would transmit from the English coast (and targeted for the UK), but due to changes in the law the ship was forced to move, and despite the deal with Veronica they dropped anchor next to the Norderney and started targeting the Dutch audience. As the transmitters of the Mebo II were very powerful Veronica was afraid they would lose market-share to the Mebo II transmissions. Also, the Dutch government threatened to ratify new international \\"Treaty of Stasbourgh\\": laws that would make offshore radio illegal which would also be the end of Veronica. Co-owner and advertising manager Norbert Jürgens advises Verweij to sabotage the anchors of the Mebo II so it would drift within the 6 mile-zone, bringing the ship within (legal) reach of Dutch law and getting it confiscated for having illegal radio transmission equipment on board. Unlike Veronica's Norderney the Mebo II has its own engines so these would have to be sabotaged as well before breaking the anchor chains. Without discussing with Verweij, Jürgens changes the job for the 3 divers hired to sabotage the anchors and orders them to actually bomb an old-line in the engine room to start a fire that would force the Mebo II to be towed to the nearest harbour (or let the ship sink). Execution of the plan goes wrong: when the crew on board the Mebo II hear the bomb explode they see a small boat sail away from the Mebo II towards the coast and an SOS call is sent out in the middle of the radio-show. The three divers, that were promised 25.000 Guilders to sabotage the ship, were arrested and that lead quickly towards Jürgens and also Verweij. Veronica staff is demanding an explanation and threaten with a strike. Verweij appears on Dutch television revealing that he paid three divers 25.000 Guilders to get the Mebo II into territorial waters in a way which did not harm anybody on board. It was the plan to force the Mebo II inside the 6 nautical mile limit so that Dutch authorities could confiscate the \\"radio pirate\\" . Verweij has to admit that he was behind the sabotage but claims that his order to the divers was a sabotage without risk or violence: he claims that it was Jürgens alone who changed the plan without knowledge or approval from Verweij. Nevertheless, both Jürgens and Verweij as well as the three divers are sentenced to one year in prison.Veronicastory.nl: Bomaanslag . Suze Krijnen: 8 June 2010. Visited 29 June 2012Documentary: , retrieved: 29 June 2012 He was later sentenced to three months in jail. Verweij later accepted that, although sticking with his version of the story, he is fully responsible for the bombing and regrets being involved.Soundscapes: Verweij on the owners of the Mebo II, Bull Verweij. Visited: 30 June 2012 The plan completely backfires as the general public sympathizes with Radio Noordzee and the station gains popularity. The additional radioship and station targeting the Dutch marketplace as well as the very powerful signal from the Mebo II forms the direct reason for Dutch Parliament to vote in favor of ratifying the \\"Strasbourgh Treaty\\", leading to the closing down of Veronica and Radio Noordzee on 31 August 1974.  After Radio Veronica  Verweij turned 100 years old in 2009 receiving an Lifetime Achievement Award from news anchor Arend Langenberg for his influence on Dutch commercial radio.

Little is known of his early life, first being mentioned in 1550 as he travelled to Rome, where he associated with his uncle Reginald Cardinal Pole. He spent three years in Italy before travelling to Poland, obtaining the recommendation of King Sigismund Augustus who requested Mary restore him to the Dukedom of Buckingham.Thomas Stafford, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, accessed 17 January 2010 Rebellion Augustus's appeal appeared to have no effect. When Stafford returned to England in January 1554 he joined the rebellion led by Thomas Wyatt; this arose out of concern of Mary's determination to marry Philip II of Spain. The rebellion failed and Thomas was captured and briefly imprisoned in the Fleet Prison before fleeing to France. There, he intrigued with other English exiles and continued to promote his claim to the English throne. On 18 April 1557 (Easter Sunday) Stafford sailed from Dieppe with two ships and over 30 men.

In 832, he was made the deputy minister of worship (太常少卿, Taichang Shaoqing). As Zheng was capable in reading ancient texts and knowledgeable about the Confucian classics, it was said that whenever there were disputes among the scholars at the ministry of worship about the meanings of the Zuo Zhuan or the three texts about rites (i.e., the Rites of Zhou, the Etiquette and Rituals, and the Classic of Rites), Zheng was the one who would settle the disputes. At that time, Emperor Wenzong favored his oldest son Li Yong the Prince of Lu and wanted famed Confucian scholars to serve on his staff, so he selected Yu Jingxiu () to serve as Li Yong's teacher, Li Jianfang () to serve as Li Yong's military advisor, and Zheng to serve as Li Yong's secretary general, with all three continuing to hold their other posts as well; it was from this point that Zheng began to become well-known. After Li Yong was subsequently created crown prince, Zheng was given an additional title as imperial attendant (給事中, Jishizhong). In 834, he, along with his colleague Han Ci (), made an unsuccessful attempt to stop the promotions Emperor Wenzong was bestowing on the emperor's close associate Li Zhongyan (on account of Li Zhongyan's past crimes).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. In 835, he was made the deputy minister of justice (刑部侍郎, Xingbu Shilang), and was soon made Shangshu You Cheng (), one of the secretaries general at the executive bureau; he was also put in charge of selecting officials at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Libu). Early in Emperor Wenzong's Kaicheng era (836-840), Zheng was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Shanguo Circuit (陝虢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). In 837, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as the deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang). As Emperor Wenzong knew that Zheng had previously served under Li Yong and was righteous in his behavior and words, he also made Zheng an advisor to Li Yong and had him teach Li Yong the Confucian classics. Subsequently, when Li Yong began to lose Emperor Wenzong's favor due to accusations made against him by Emperor Wenzong's favorite concubine Consort Yang, Emperor Wenzong considered deposing Li Yong. Zheng tried to intercede on Li Yong's behalf by discussing with Emperor Wenzong the Confucian principles on lord-subject and father-son relationships, and Emperor Wenzong thanked him. However, after Li Yong was nearly deposed in 838 and died later that year,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. Zheng was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality.  During Emperor Wuzong's reign  After Emperor Wenzong died in 840 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Wuzong, it was said that Emperor Wuzong knew that Li Yong had been falsely accused and therefore executed a number of people involved in falsely accusing Li Yong. Meanwhile, the officials at court praised Zheng Su for his faithfulness, so Emperor Wuzong recalled Zheng to serve as the minister of worship (太常卿, Taichang Qing). He subsequently served as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei). In 845, he was recalled to serve as acting You Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau, and chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. He was also put in charge of editing the imperial history.  During Emperor Xuānzong's reign  After Emperor Wuzong died in 846 and was succeeded by his uncle Emperor Xuānzong, Emperor Xuānzong, despising the lead chancellor Li Deyu for his hold on power, removed Li Deyu from his chancellor post and sent him out of Chang'an. As Zheng had a strong friendship with Li Deyu, Zheng was also removed. He was sent to Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) to serve as its military governor, continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. When he died, he was given posthumous honors, including the posthumous name Wenjian (文簡, \\"civil and approachable\\"); his year of death was not recorded in history.

The communist Eastern China Field Army besieged and finally captured the city of Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province and a major urban center as well as a transportation hub in northeastern China that had a population of about 600,000 at the time of the battle.CHINA: Province for a Poet, Time Magazine, Oct. 04, 1948 The communist victory set the stage for the Huaihai Campaign.Tony Jaques (2007), Dictionary of Battles and Sieges, Greenwood Press, Volume F-O, pg. 494 The defenders of Jinan had become isolated in the summer of 1948, when the communist Eastern China Field Army commanded by Chen Yi captured the railway line south of the city. In charge of the city's defense was general Wang Yaowu, he commanded nine regular brigades, five security brigades, as well as special force units amounting to a total troop strength of about 100,000. The defenses of Jinan were organized into two lines: an outer ring around the outskirts of the city and inner line following the historical city wall. The outer ring was fortified by a four-ply line of pillboxes, barbed wire, and a newly dug 3-meter wide moat. The inner ring consisted of the ancient brick wall of the city that had been strengthened with sand bags. The most valuable strategic assets of the city, the main airfield, the railroad station, and the commercial district, were located to the west of the historical city center and outside of the inner ring. Hence, they were protected only by the outer ring of defenses. The communist forces encircled the city in a pincer movement carried out by an eastern and a western group. The eastern group was composed of the 9th column, the Bohai column, and one division of the Bohai military region. The western group consistent of the 3rd column, the 10th column, the Liang Guang column, four regiments of the mid-south Shandong column, and one division from the Jiluyu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) Military Region. The 13th column served as the preparation team for the entire attack. General Wu Huawen () was in charge of the outer ring of defenses. General Wu defected to the communist side with about 8,000 of his troops before the battle began. Odd Arne Westad (2003): Decisive encounters: the Chinese Civil War, Stanford University Press, pg. 40 His defection may have been prompted by letter sent to him by close relatives who had been captured by the Communists in the summer. Most of Wu's troops had fought on the Japanese side during the Second Sino-Japanese War and were integrated into Su Yu's forces immediately. After the outer ring of defenses was lost due to Wu's defection, communist forces launched a bloody assault on the historical city center. The historical city wall was first breached at its southeastern corner around 2am on September 24. Another breach at the southwest corner also occurred before dawn. After the city wall was breached, the remaining Kuomintang garrison was quickly overrun and captured. General Wang Yaowu tried to escape in civilian clothes but was captured in Shouguang County. Pang Jingtang(), the Kuomintang party chief in Shandong as well as 23 other high-ranking Kuomintang officials were also captured. Jinan was the first major urban center to be captured by the communists (the Siege of Changchun had begun on May 23 already, but the city was only captured on October 19, 1948). Zhou Enlai hence referred to the Battle of Jinan as the starting point for the \\"three great battles\\" (), namely the Liaoshen Campaign (the first stage of which had already begun on September 12, 1948, i.e., a few days prior to the Battle of Jinan), the Huaihai Campaign, and the Pingjin CampaignThe Quick Success of the Jinan Campaign, official web site of the Memorial for the Battle of Jinan (in Chinese) that established communist control over northern China.

At one point, the Sarandoy fielded some 115,000 men, compared to the Afghan Army's 160,000, while at other times the Sarandoy were said to exceed the Army. Those who served in the Sarandoy were paid 162 dollars a month, a wage which was higher than that of Deputy Minister of National Defence before the April 1978 Saur Revolution. The Sarandoy was subjected to internal politics, as its forces were controlled by the Khalqi Communist faction, opposed to the Parchami Communist faction which controlled the KhAD intelligence services. Accordingly, armed clashes occurred on occasion between the Sarandoy and the KhAD. Mark Urban wrote in 1988 that '...By 1985 there were 20 identified Sarandoy Operational Battalions and Mountain Battalions. They were attached to provincial Sarandoy commands and include[d] armoured vehicles and light artillery. The Kabul Security Command controlled two mobile regiments (the 1st and 2nd)... A further four Sarandoy brigades/regiments have been identified in Badakhshan (24th Sarandoy Brigade), Kandahar, Baghlan and Parwan.'Urban, War in Afghanistan (1988), p. 226. At the beginning of 1986, operational control of some units passed to the new unified Ministry of State Security. A number of previously Sarandoy tribal militia units were eventually upgraded to Afghan Army formations, as part of the regularization of the militia.Giustozzi, War, Politics and Society in Afghanistan, 1978-1992 (2000), page unknown.

It was released in the United Kingdom on September 1, 1993. Gameplay Blob takes place on tiles floating at different levels in space. The player controls the game's eponymous character, Blob, with the 3D perspective allowing the character to be moved around the tiles at the current level, bounced up to a title at a higher level or dropped down to a lower level. There are 50 worlds in the game, each of which requires either an exit to be found or the collection of items located around it, in order to clear it. Other objectives may need to be completed in order to activate an exit, such as coming into contact with all tiles in a world (similar to the game Q-Bert) or rescuing a certain number of creatures known as Blobletts. There are different types of tile, which have effect on the characters behaviour. These include tiles which bounce Blob higher than usual, that restrict his ability to bounce, that are turned on and off by a switch and tiles covered in ice, that prevent the player from changing the direction of the character until it slides onto a normal tile. Falling onto a tile from too high causes the character to get hurt, and may damage the tile causing it to crack and eventually break. Blob can also be hurt by aliens, and after a certain amount of damage is sustained, he will lose a life. A life is also lost should Blob fall past the lowest level of tiles in a world. Development Development of Blob spanned about a year, from September 1992 until its release in September 1993. Jonnathan Hilliard, the game's lead developer began working on it as he completed his degree course at university. He had worked on 3D systems as part of his university course, and used this knowledge to develop Blob's 3D game engine. Hilliard sent a sample of the game, named at the time \\"Bouncy Thing\\", to ten different publishers, in a near-finished state of completion. This resulted in Core Design commissioning the game and hiring Hilliard to work for the company full-time as a developer. After agreeing to publish the game, Core Design had Billy Allison redesign the graphics, using the Deluxe Paint IV software application, to have more animation in a bid to give the main character more personality. Other changes to the game focused on improving the general presentation and adding more alien characters. The name of the game was also changed during development, firstly to Odd Blob, before a vote held by Core staff decided on Blob as the release title. Reception Blob received mixed critical reaction from the Amiga gaming press. Amiga Power provided one of the most positive reviews for the game, describing the game as \\"brilliantly original\\" and \\"maddeningly addictive\\" and praised its easily graspable gameplay in awarding the game a score of 88%. A positive review was also given by Amiga Format who described Blob as \\"wonderfully different\\" and stated that the 3d perspective gave a unique viewpoint which set it apart from other puzzle games. Both The One and Amiga Computing criticised the game's control system, which led to The One criticising the game as being too unforgiving and awarding a score of 67%.

Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics), Vol.39, No.6. 1362-1381 Guiding designs by performance improvements Interaction in computer-automated design To meet the ever-growing demand of quality and competitiveness, iterative physical prototyping is now often replaced by 'digital prototyping' of a 'good design', which aims to meet multiple objectives such as maximised output, energy efficiency, highest speed and cost-effectiveness. The design problem concerns both finding the best design within a known range (i.e., through 'learning' or 'optimisation') and finding a new and better design beyond the existing ones (i.e., through creation and invention). This is equivalent to a search problem in an almost certainly, multidimensional (multivariate), multi-modal space with a single (or weighted) objective or multiple objectives. Normalized objective function: cost vs. fitness Using single-objective CAutoD as an example, if the objective function, either as a cost function J\\\\in[0, \\\\infty), or inversely, as a fitness function f\\\\in(0,1], where :f = \\\\tfrac{J}{1+J}, is differentiable under practical constraints in the multidimensional space, the design problem may be solved analytically. Finding the parameter sets that result in a zero first-order derivative and that satisfy the second-order derivative conditions would reveal all local optima. Then comparing the values of the performance index of all the local optima, together with those of all boundary parameter sets, would lead to the global optimum, whose corresponding 'parameter' set will thus represent the best design. However, in practice, the optimization usually involves multiple objectives and the matters involving derivatives are a lot more complex. Dealing with practical objectives In practice, the objective value may be noisy or even non-numerical, and hence its gradient information may be unreliable or unavailable. This is particularly true when the problem is multi-objective. At present, many designs and refinements are mainly made through a manual trial-and-error process with the help of a CAD simulation package. Usually, such a posteriori learning or adjustments need to be repeated many times until a ‘satisfactory’ or ‘optimal’ design emerges. Exhaustive search In theory, this adjustment process can be automated by computerised search, such as exhaustive search. As this is an exponential algorithm, it may not deliver solutions in practice within a limited period of time. Search in polynomial time One approach to virtual engineering and automated design is evolutionary computation such as evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms To reduce the search time, the biologically-inspired evolutionary algorithm (EA) can be used instead, which is a (non-deterministic) polynomial algorithm. The EA based multi-objective \\"search team\\" can be interfaced with an existing CAD simulation package in a batch mode. The EA encodes the design parameters (encoding being necessary if some parameters are non-numerical) to refine multiple candidates through parallel and interactive search. In the search process, 'selection' is performed using 'survival of the fittest' a posteriori learning. To obtain the next 'generation' of possible solutions, some parameter values are exchanged between two candidates (by an operation called 'crossover') and new values introduced (by an operation called 'mutation'). This way, the evolutionary technique makes use of past trial information in a similarly intelligent manner to the human designer. The EA based optimal designs can start from the designer's existing design database, or from an initial generation of candidate designs obtained randomly. A number of finely evolved top-performing candidates will represent several automatically optimized digital prototypes. There are websites that demonstrate interactive evolutionary algorithms for design. EndlessForms.com allows you to evolve 3D objects online and have them 3D printed. PicBreeder.org allows you to do the same for 2D images.

After enjoying a good 2010–2011 season, the first team finished runners up in the Mid Wales League South, ending a point behind Builth Wells and were promoted to the Spar Mid League 2nd Division, at the time a newly created league. For the 2011–12 season the first team played their first season in the Spar Mid Wales League Division 2. A relative success after promotion saw Llandrindod placed fourth behind winners Aberaeron, with second placed Four Crosses also promoted to the Spar League One. Llanfair United placed 3rd. The season ended with cup success, defeating Hay St Marys to win the Radnorshire cup at Builth Wells In the 2012–2013 season, Llandrindod firsts played their second season in the Spar Mid Wales League Division 2. After a very good start, going undefeated in the first 10 games, the side fell away after Christmas but finished the season as runners up to winners Llanfair United. Both clubs were promoted to the Spar League Division One for the 2013–14 season. In the season 2013–14 the Llandrindod First team won a staggering 16 games out of 16 in their inaugural season in the Spar Mid Wales League division 1. This included an opening day 8–1 away win at local rivals Builth Wells and a further win away at Montgomery 13–0. The team went on to maintain their form enough over the season to win the Spar Mid Wales League Division One at their first attempt. The team remained undefeated at home in the league, only dropping 2 points. The season culminated in a must win last day victory over Montgomery Town. The 3–1 scoreline secured the league and in the process took the team to 101 goals in just 28 games, whilst also conceding the fewest goals. Remarkably, the runners up were fellow promoted club Llanfair United. Over the season, some 20 players featured in the team. Injuries and absences took their toll after Christmas but the whole squad and strength in depth ensured that the team deservedly triumphed and won the league for the first time in 47 years. Of the whole squad, at least 15 players had played at junior and youth level for the club. After ground improvements in the new year of 2014, the club met the ground criteria for the 2014–15 season to return to the Cymru Alliance, the second tier of Welsh Club Football. The reserve team will again compete in the Mid Wales League South for the 2014–15 season.

(See Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Female members for details on titles). was a Manchu princess of the Qing dynasty. She was the tenth and youngest daughter of the Qianlong Emperor. Her mother was Consort Dun. Birth and childhood Gurun Princess Hexiao was born in 1775 when the Qianlong Emperor was already 63 years old. At the time of her birth, nearly all of the Qianlong Emperor's other daughters, including Gurun Princess Hejing (固倫和敬公主) and Heshuo Princess Heke (和碩和恪公主), had either died or married and left the palace. The Qianlong Emperor was thus overjoyed when he heard news of the birth of another daughter. Gurun Princess Hexiao was deeply favoured by her father from birth. Throughout her childhood, ministers and courtiers remarked that the Tenth Princess – as she was commonly referred to – resembled her father in appearance. She was said to be resolute in character, and frequently accompanied the Qianlong Emperor on hunting excursions. Going against tradition, the Qianlong Emperor elevated his tenth daughter from the status of a \\"Heshuo Princess\\" (the rank usually accorded to a princess born to a consort below the rank of Empress) to a \\"Gurun Princess\\" (the rank of a princess born to the Empress). Therefore, the Tenth Princess became known by her title \\"Gurun Princess Hexiao\\". Marriage On 12 January 1790, she married Fengšeninde (豐紳殷德; 1775–1810) of the Niohuru clan, a prominent Manchu clan. Fengšeninde was the eldest son of Heshen, an official highly favoured by the Qianlong Emperor. Gurun Princess Hexiao's dowry of 300,000 silver taels far exceeded that of any other of the Qianlong Emperor's daughters. Gurun Princess Hexiao and Fengšeninde had a son, who was born sometime between 1794 and 1796, but died young in 1798. Heshen's fall from power In 1799, shortly after the Qianlong Emperor's death, Gurun Princess Hexiao's father-in-law, Heshen, was arrested on charges of corruption and political incompetence. Found guilty, Heshen was initially sentenced to death by slow slicing. However, the Jiaqing Emperor, who succeeded the Qianlong Emperor, permitted Heshen to commit suicide in his own residence out of respect for his tenth sister. Heshen's immense wealth, amassed over a long career of corrupt activities, were confiscated. The Jiaqing Emperor granted amnesty to Gurun Princess Hexiao and even granted her part of Heshen's confiscated property. Fengšeninde, on the other hand, was stripped of his privileges and titles but remained similarly unharmed. Later life In 1806, the Jiaqing Emperor sent Fengšeninde to Uliastai to serve as a military official. Fengšeninde fell ill after serving there for some time. Gurun Princess Hexiao begged the Jiaqing Emperor to allow them to return to Beijing. The Emperor agreed. Fengšeninde returned to Beijing in February 1810 and was enfeoffed as the \\"Duke of Jin\\" (晋公). He died three months later in May, leaving Gurun Princess Hexiao widowed. After Fengšeninde's death, Gurun Princess Hexiao raised his two daughters (both born to his concubine), who were 11 and five years old respectively when their father died. She was financially stable; the Jiaqing Emperor made the Imperial Household Department ensure that she was well taken care of. Gurun Princess Hexiao died on 13 October 1823 during the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor's successor, the Daoguang Emperor. The cost of her funeral, paid for by the Imperial Household Department, amounted to about 5,000 silver taels.

Founding From 1943, the agents of the Deutsche Partei of the Slovakian Germans, sent news of partisan activities in Slovakia to Germany. In the summer of 1944, these reports were becoming more common and more specific about the activities of partisans in Eastern and Central Slovakia. On July 25, 1944, a meeting of Slovak German leaders was held in Bratislava. Here, Franz Karmasin called for the establishment of a paramilitary organization in the Slovak state. On August 19, 1944 Karmas sent a summary report to Heinrich Himmler in which he stated that the situation in Slovakia was becoming critical, not only because of frequent partisan activities but also because of the division and weakness of the Slovak forces. Karmasin also informed Himmler that the Germans in Slovakia had begun to set up the Heimatschutz (HS), an armed organization under the command of Ferdinand Klug, head of the Freiwillige Schutzstaffel (FS), with the agreement of the German Embassy. Tasks and Activities The main task of Heimatschutz was to protect the German minority in Slovakia against possible partisan attacks, so they started arming their members. Karmasin's plan failed however because the Slovak national uprising exploded earlier than expected on August 29, 1944, and in some cases the weapons intended for arming the Heimatschutz members were seized by the partisans. At the beginning of September, 1944, the training of members of the HS armed organization began, involving the 8,000 male Germans in Slovakia. At the time of the uprising, Heimatschutz units were under the command of SS-Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger. Following the outbreak of the uprising, armed units of the HS were strengthened and in many cases committed crimes against the Slovak civilian population. There were campaigns against the partisans hiding in the mountains and in the forests. After the collapse of the Slovak national uprising, in November 1944, the Heimatschutz, together with SS units and the Hlinka Guard, they embarked on a campaign of terror. Establishment and Activities In March 1945, the Heimatschutz armed forces were reorganized and the SS- Heimatschutz \\"Slowakei\\" unit was set up under SS-Obersturmbannführer Hans Thumser. The commander of the SS-Heimatschutz \\"Slowakei\\" was Colonel Rudolf Pilfousek, formerly an officer of the Czechoslovak Army, who later participated in the campaign against the Soviet Union as an officer of the Slovakian army, and joined the SS in 1944 as SS-Standartenführer. Pilfousek was directly responsible to SS-Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger. SS- Heimatschutz's \\"Slowakei\\" operations were not long-lived, its combat activity was not significant and its members had a low level of combat morale.

He was the first Coloured priest to hold the position of Dean of Kimberley. He served under Bishops Njongonkulu Ndungane, afterwards the Archbishop of Cape Town, and Itumeleng Baldwin Moseki. Marcus supported the ordination of women and he helped prepare the first two women to be ordained deacon (and subsequently as priests) in the Diocese (by Bishop Ndungane) in 1995. Projects initiated by Marcus in Kimberley included the establishment of a ‘Tamar House’ place of safety for abused women and Rape Crisis Centre and an Ecubread feeding scheme for the homeless.

Adding to the fabric of the cathedral, stained glass by Estelle Valle was installed in the remaining clerestory windows in the sanctuary and nave, and the Stations of the Cross carved in wood by Bill Davis were introduced to the outer walls of the north and south aisles. Marcus was renowned for his insightful weekly commentaries in the cathedral pew leaflet, sometimes also published in the local press.

The clubhouse on Broadview Avenue was originally built in 1907 by the Royal Canadian Bicycle Club, while the ice arena was added in 1929. In addition to cycling activities, the club had featured skating, baseball, ice hockey, curling, and ten-pin bowling, until 1953, when the club decided to focus exclusively on curling activities. Known to its members as The Royals, the club hosts house league draws on evenings from Sunday to Friday as well as Tuesday afternoons. The club also hosts associate leagues including the Riverdale League, the Rotators, and the Insurance Curling League. The club has sponsored winning teams at provincial curling championships. In 1955, Andy Grant won The British Consols, southern Ontario's men's curling championship. This tournament has gone through a number of name changes in its history and is now known as the TSC Tankard. Ontario Scott Tournament of Hearts winners include Carol Thompson in 1982 and 1987 and Hollie Duncan in 2018. In Senior's curling, Jim Sharples has won a number of events including 1992 & 1994 (Joe Todd Sr.), 1998 (T.E. Financial Consultants Ltd.), 1999 (CIBC Seniors), and the Tim Hortons Masters in 2000 and 2003. Bob Wood and Carol Thompson represented Ontario at the Seagram Mixed Tournament in 1977.

There are currently 6 board members. The club is member owned. New members purchase equity in the club when they start to curl. The equity is returned to the club when they resign as a member. Only active curlers are allowed to hold equity in the club. There are about 400 active curlers. The club employs a general manager, two bartenders, a full-time and a part-time ice maker. Bonspiels In 1938, the Men's Invitational Bonspiel was created. It ran for 27 years before ending in 1964. In 2003, the event was revived. The event is held late March running from Thursday to Sunday. The 2003 event featured Ontario's venerable Ed Werenich who came a close second in the tournament to the club's own Rob MacKay. In 2009, Ed's son Ryan Werenich skipped the winning team. Other regular events include the Turkey Spiel in December, Curling Night in Canada in February, and the women's spiel entitled the Royal Flush. The associate Riverdale League also holds an annual spiel entitled Do It On The Ice, and in March 2015 will simultaneously host the 10th annual Canadian Gay Curling Championship (CGCC).

FDR is often described as a model checker, but is technically a refinement checker, in that it converts two CSP process expressions into Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs), and then determines whether one of the processes is a refinement of the other within some specified semantic model (traces, failures, failures/divergence and some other alternatives). FDR2 applies various state- space compression algorithms to the process LTSs in order to reduce the size of the state-space that must be explored during a refinement check. FDR2 has gone through many releases, having replaced the earlier tool now referred to as FDR1 in 1995.

It is the latest installment in the NBA Jam video game franchise, released in 2010. The game was initially planned to be available as a full retail release for the Wii, with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions available for download via a coupon upon purchasing NBA Elite 11. However, on September 28, 2010, EA announced that Elite would be delayed. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions were released as standalone titles in November 2010. The game has a unique visual style, using 3D models with high-resolution photographs for the heads of each of the players. Several aspects such as the outrageous slam dunks and the ball catching on fire return from the original games. Original NBA Jam creator Mark Turmell is serving as a consultant. Tim Kitzrow, the announcer from the original NBA Jam also returns, re-recording all the lines from previous NBA Jam titles. All NBA Rosters are accurate as of April 7, 2010. The Mac version of the game is also available for Mac OS X through the Mac version of the Mac App Store, making it the only official computer version of the game. Gameplay An in-game screenshot of NBA Jam on iOS, demonstrating the controls on that platform. NBA Jam is a 2-on-2 basketball game with a unique art style. In the game, the bodies take on a 3D look, while their heads take on a 2D look, which have realistic digitized likenesses. The game retains its usual exaggerated nature of play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except defensive goaltending and shot clock violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game has an \\"on fire\\" feature, where if one player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \\"on fire\\" and has unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scores (or the player has scored nine consecutive baskets while \\"on fire\\"). Some new features in NBA Jam include Campaign, which has 1-on-1 boss battles; Elimination, which includes up to four players and the player with the lowest number of points is the loser; 21, which is a 1-on-1 match where the first one to get 21 points is the winner; and Domination. The game is filled with Easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players. Some characters can only be unlocked by completing certain challenges. Wii The Wii version of the game is split into two modes, a classic mode which plays like a traditional NBA Jam experience, and a Remix Tour which features all new camera angles, power-ups and boss battles. Players are able to choose between Wii Remote, Wii Remote and Nunchuck, Classic Controller, and Classic Controller Pro control styles. Online play is not supported. At the end of the game, players have to battle NBA legends Larry Bird and Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson. The game also features more than 30 other legends including: Manute Bol, Clyde Drexler, Julius Erving, Kevin McHale, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dennis Rodman, Detlef Schrempf, Isiah Thomas, Spud Webb, and James Worthy. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 In November 2010 a standalone game was released from EA Sports. A downloadable HD version of NBA Jam for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was planned to be bundled with copies of NBA Elite 11. This version initially lacked the Wii version's Remix Tour mode, but included online multiplayer. However, due to the delay of NBA Elite 11 (followed by its eventual cancellation), the HD versions of NBA Jam would now be standalone products; they were released in November 2010, and included the Remix Tour mode. EA Sports President Peter Moore stated that the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would be released \\"before the holidays\\" in 2010, and the game would be released on retail disc. On October 21 EA announced they would release full retail copies of the game on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on November 17, and would retail for $49.99. These enhanced versions would feature upgraded HD visuals and online play, and would receive further online updates in December. Release An enhanced On Fire edition of NBA Jam was released for the Xbox 360 and PS3 in October 2011 as a downloadable title.

Reception=NBA Jam NBA Jam received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms except the PlayStation 3 version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN called the Wii version \\"an incredibly fun pick-up-and-play game with an insane competitive edge.\\" Game Informer said that the same console version's only major flaw is its lack of online multiplayer. GameTrailers said that the lack of online play in the same console version hurts its value as a retail product. GameZone gave the same console version seven out of ten and stated, \\"With an all too familiar feeling, NBA Jam serves as homage to the games we have lost from yesteryear. What it boils down to is: the gameplay hasn't changed all that much and aside from unlocking the plethora of classic players such as Detlef Schrempf and Chris Mullin, there's little reason to return to NBA Jam after a few hours of play.\\" PlayStation Official Magazine – Australia gave the PS3 version eight out of ten, saying that it \\"always succeeded by being better with friends, and that hasn't changed. There's an updated remix mode with a few new modes that are more gimmick and curious distractions than serious contenders for your time. You'll get the most amount of playtime out of the standard mode, especially when you're really dominating a game against your mates.\\" However, PlayStation Official Magazine – UK gave it six out of ten, saying that \\"it'll keep you amused for an hour every few weeks.\\" On Fire Edition The On Fire Edition received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to Metacritic.

History Launched on April 26, 2005 by Setanta Sports, which is based in Ireland, the channel had the rights to delayed Manchester United and Chelsea matches on MUTV and Chelsea TV, which were shown in segments within the channel. Any given broadcaster can only gain access to a maximum of two club channels under the current Premier League international TV rights.

Both Setanta Sports Channel Ireland Limited and Setanta Sports North America Limited were licensed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. On January 27, 2010, Setanta Sports announced that they had reached an agreement with Fox Soccer Channel to transfer rights to select programming (soccer and rugby) that would be effective as of March 1.

As of 2019, Fox Soccer Plus main soccer programming consists of live and delayed Bundesliga matches and highlight programming from the league, replays of Major League Soccer games shown on Fox or FS1, replays of FIFA events (although some events from lower level FIFA competitions that Fox holds the rights to are sometimes shown live) and occasionally, games from the Liga MX and Copa do Brasil. Rugby League Fox Soccer Plus continues to air rugby league content from Australia and England. Currently, Fox Soccer Plus airs three of Australia's National Rugby League games per round, all three State of Origin games (often shown live on FS2 first), all playoff games, and the NRL Grand Final. With the exception of the Origin games, the broadcast source is Fox League, which shares the basic video feed from Nine Network but inserts its own graphics and commentators, meaning that Fox Soccer Plus viewers do not have the option of the typically-thought-superior announcers and production values of Nine. Australian Rules Football Fox Soccer Plus typically carries four regular-season Australian Football League matches each week, with three of those shown live and one being a replay of the one game a week shown live first on FS2; all playoffs and the Grand Final are carried, along with preseason matches and the AFL Women's league. Fox Soccer Plus coverage comes from both Fox Footy and the Seven Network. With America-born Mason Cox playing in the league, most matches featuring Collingwood, Cox's current team, tend to be shown.

It tells the story of two families, one Jewish and the other Palestinian, who both lost children during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, known to Palestinians as the 1948 Palestinian exodus, the Naqba, or \\"Catastrophe.\\" The film, directed by Ram Loevy, caused considerable controversy when it aired on 1 August 1972. It was the first time that an Arab viewers had a chance to experience the emotional significance of the Holocaust for Jews, and it was also the first time that Israeli Jews had an opportunity to experience the emotional significance of the Naqba to the Palestinian people. Loevy first came up with the idea behind the documentary in 1968, while studying film in London. As a Hebrew-language broadcaster for the BBC, he had proposed creating a documentary about the social rifts tearing at Israeli society, with one episode focusing on the conflict between Jews and Palestinians. Although the BBC expressed interest in the project, Loevy returned to Israel soon after to help launch Channel 1, the country's first attempt at television broadcasting. He did not, however, abandon the idea, albeit in a more reduced format. Back in Israel, Loevy pitched the idea to the Israel Broadcasting Authority, which agreed to fund the project. At the time, Professor Eliyahu Katz, one of the founders of Israeli television, explained that the idea fulfilled one of the major purposes for which television was brought to Israel: to strengthen ties between the Jewish and Arab residents of the country.Gil Sadan, \\"Mourning on Both Sides of the Barricade,\\" in Yediot Ahronot, 1 August 1972. Loevy made the film in 1969. The plotline focused on two families: the Shevat family of Haifa, which had lost two sons in battle during the War of Independence, and the family of Hussein Abu-Muhammad Yehia of the Jalazoon refugee camp near Ramallah, who lost two sons when the family fled from their ancestral home in the town of Ramla. For over two decades, the families had been trapped in the past, still mourning their two sons. Though Israel was then living in the shadow of the Six-Day War, Loevy made a conscious decision to base his story on 1948, explaining, \\"We focused on that year in order to push the testimonies back into the past. The two families in the film never meet; instead, a visit to the graves and a visit to the ruins of the Arab village are juxtaposed. By the time the film was finished, however, Israel was engaged in a brutal War of Attrition with its neighbors, and several new Palestinian guerrilla factions were taking up the armed struggle against Israel as a means of achieving self-determination.Kapitan, 1997, p. 30. Focusing on the tragedy of the Palestinian people would, it was believed, only incite further violence. The film was shelved for three years, and only aired on 1 August 1972. The decision to finally air Barricades was made by Yeshayahu Tadmor, who had recently been appointed by the government to head Israeli television. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot he said that if the War of Attrition had still been raging, he would not have screened it either. Yet even Tadmor's decision's was guarded. He agreed to screen Barricades, but only as part of a popular talk show, The Third Hour, so that the content could be discussed by a panel of \\"experts,\\" which would ideally include both Arabs and Jews. Only Jews participated, however. One Arab guest, Muhammad Ali Ja'abari, mayor of Hebron and a Jordanian parliamentarian, refused to participate. At the same time, Israel's Foreign Minister Abba Eban refused to appear with a second guest, Anwar Nusseibeh, former Jordanian defense minister and governor of Jerusalem. In the end, none of them participated, and the Director General of the IBA Shmuel Almog decided not to replace them.The following account was related to the author of this article by Ram Loevy in a personal interview. An article appearing in the Israeli press at the time (\\"Only Jews Participated in The Third Hour,\\" in Haaretz, 2 August 1972) hints at the dispute, but places the onus of blame on the Arab participants. Another article in Yediot Ahronot from the day of the screening (Gil Sadan, \\"Eban Will Not Participate in The Third Hour This Evening,\\" 2 August 1972) says that Eban refused to appear unless the Arab participants of his choosing also appeared. An editorial published in the newspaper Maariv two days after Barricades was aired noted that in the end, the ensuing discussion was unbalanced. Not only did the film fail to present the Palestinian side of the issue, but the remaining guests were either politicians or people known for their political positions. It added that whereas Loevy had succeeded in depicting an emotional portrait of two families' personal tragedies, the guests focused on the political issues while engaging in a game of political one-upmanship with the absent representatives of the Palestinians. \\"It would have been better,\\" wrote the author, \\"if intellectuals, whose conscious is plagued by the problems inherent in our relationship with the Arabs, had participated.\\"Doron Rosenblum, \\"A Sad Discussion About a Sad Topic,\\" in Maariv, 3 August 1972. Despite the politicization of Barricades, the film challenged pre-existing notions about Palestinian refugees then prevalent in Israeli society and led many people, however briefly, to reconsider their attitudes toward the Palestinian right of return. The debate surrounding the screening of the film also presaged the tension surrounding Loevy's 1978 film Khirbet Khizeh.

Tuesday 12 January 2010  16:53 local time (21:53 UTC): the earthquake happened. People dug through rubble, rescuing survivors and recovering bodies. The bodies were laid out in the streets, some in piles. During the night, many people digging through the rubble used flashlights or torches. The Argentine Air Force Mobile Field Hospital, already deployed at Port-au-Prince, was the only medical facility still open.Only one Hospital still active in Haiti Argentine helicopters from the United Nations force were helping evacuate the gravely injured people to Santo Domingo.  13 January 2010  Two US Coast Guard cutters offshore of Haiti on 13 January 2010 USAF Combat Controllers directing air traffic in from Toussaint Louverture International Airport Haitian Rescuers searched collapsed buildings for victims. The wounded were taken to hospital in ambulances, police pickup trucks, wheelbarrows, and improvised stretchers. Many hospitals collapsed: on 13 January 2010, the Argentine military field hospital remained open in Port-au-Prince, and it was struggling to attend to the huge numbers of injured. Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) reported that at least two hospitals were still in good shape, and their doctors would begin treating about 500 people who needed emergency surgery. Bodies of the victims were piled on the streets. Heavy equipment was needed to dig through the ruins; many people were still trapped in collapsed buildings. A triage center was set up in a parking lot, but the wounded were forced to lie in medical tents to await treatment, due to the many patients, and water was scarce. In Pétion-Ville, people used sledgehammers and their hands to dig through a collapsed commercial center. The first international team to arrive in Port- au-Prince was ICE-SAR from Iceland, landing within 24 hours of the earthquake. Some rescue teams, such as the ones from Cuba, arrived in Haiti and started their mission. The Peruvian government sent rescue teams, dogs and 50 tons of food transported by two Peruvian Air Force airplanes. Peruvian companies were providing food donations and other basic aid. However, the scale of rescue and relief efforts was yet to meet the need. Because of difficulties reaching some affected areas, some rescue teams tried to enter Haiti through the Dominican Republic. The United States Coast Guard deployed helicopters and several aircraft and cutters to the region to aid in relief work and perform reconnaissance flights over Haiti, which aided in assessing the worst damaged areas. The Coast Guard Cutter Forward arrived in the waters off Port-au-Prince at about 8 a.m. on Wednesday, and together with a Maritime Intelligence Support Team was able to assess some of the damage caused to the port. The Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk also arrived in the coastal waters of Haiti on Wednesday afternoon. The International Committee of the Red Cross set up a special website to facilitate family contacts, which allowed people in Haiti and abroad to register the names of relatives whom they wanted to contact. It incorporated responses to those queries as they became available. Catholic Relief Services, which has worked in Haiti for 50 years, prepared food and other aid to help those affected, committing US $5 million to help survivors. At 7pm EST a team of United States Air Force Combat Controllers landed at Toussaint Louverture International Airport and established control of Air Traffic Control duties within 28 minutes to assist in humanitarian aid efforts. The Combat Controllers directed over 2,500 flights without incident from a card table using only hand radios. Under their direction planes were able to take off and land every five minutes, bringing in over 4 million lb. of supplies. The team leader of the Combat Controllers, Chief Master Sergeant Tony Travis, was later recognized as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2010 because of their efforts.  14 January 2010  Medical aid for the Haiti earthquake became a military-style operation. At least 20 countries provided manpower, supplies or financial aid to Haiti, while the most immediate foreign assistance was being provided by military and humanitarian contingents from neighboring Dominican Republic. Dominican president Leonel Fernández visited Haiti to set up an emergency plan for assistance with president René Préval, to include reestablishing communications, rescuing the victims, burying the dead, clearing the rubble, reestablishing the supplies for electricity and water and coordinating the Dominican army with the United Nations Stabilization Mission for the relief operations.

Initially, it drew the attention of Sylvester Stallone, who considered co-starring in it with Eddie Murphy and later Kurt Russell. Cannon purchased the script in the 1990s. They saw it as a vehicle for Chuck Norris and Michael Dudikoff before the eventual two leads cast by director Charles Martin Smith. The film began shooting in October 1990 and a majority of the film was shot in Malaysia. Release The film was given a limited theatrical release in the United States by Cannon Pictures beginning in March 1993. The film was later released on VHS and DVD by Warner Home Video. Originally the movie was meant to be a project for Chuck Norris during his time contracted to Cannon Films. He declined the lead role of Jake Wyer because he had made several action films in the jungle and wasn't keen on spending months in another one to shoot this film. When Stallone and Kurt Russell were in talks for the film, Stallone was to play Wyer, the Weller role, and Russell would have played Frenchy, ultimately played by Robert Hays. At one point, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy were attached to star in this project together. The movie was released on VHS in 1992 in several European countries and Australia prior to its US theatrical debut in 1993. In a recent interview (March 1, 2014), Kurt Russell recalled a story where he went to Stallone's house to discuss working on a film together. The script they were thinking of making was Fifty/Fifty. Ultimately Russell and Stallone decided to make Tango and Cash (then called The Set-Up).

It can also be described in a positive sense as a report from a consumer providing documentation about a problem with a product or service. In fact, some modern business consultants urge businesses to view customer complaints as a gift. Consumer complaints are usually informal complaints directly addressed to a company or public service provider, and most consumers manage to resolve problems with products and services but it sometimes requires persistence. An instrumental complaint is a complaint made to a person or organization that could take some action and bring about a specific remedy. An expressive complaint is a complaint made for the purpose of expressing feelings, without any realistic chance of anything being done. Most online complaints are expressive complaints.  Identifying a Consumer Complaint  Consumer complaints have three main characteristics: they are goal-oriented, there are multiple ways of engaging in this behavior, and are used to complain in several ways. A definitive characteristic of a consumer complaint is to achieve a goal that the consumer views as needing improvement. Although, there is no certainty of the goal being attained. Factors that would disrupt the process of a successful goal include: the distributor of the product may not be able to provide, or the company may lack the time or resources to address the complaint. The second characteristic is that the consumer will engage in multiple forms of complaint. Examples include: complaining directly to the company or a representative, expressing opinions to friends and family, and sending correspondence to an agency such as the Better Business Bureau. Consequently, the third unique characteristic of a consumer complaint can be identified if the consumer complains in multiple ways.  Complaining to agencies  If the grievance is not addressed in a way that satisfies the consumer, the consumer sometimes registers the complaint with a third party such as the Better Business Bureau, a local or regional government (if it has a \\"consumer protection\\" office) and Federal Trade Commission (in the United States). These and similar organizations in other countries accept for consumer complaints and assist people with customer service issues, as do government representatives like attorneys general. Consumers however rarely file complaints in the more formal legal sense, which consists of a formal legal process (see the article on complaint). In some countries (for example Australia, the United Kingdom, and many countries of the European Community), the making of consumer complaints, particularly regarding the sale of financial services, is governed by statute (law). The statutory authority may require companies to reply to complaints within set time limits, publish written procedures for handling customer dissatisfaction, and provide information about arbitration schemes.  Complaining online  Internet forums and the advent of social media have provided consumers with a new way to submit complaints. Consumer news and advocacy websites often accept and publish complaints. Publishing complaints on highly visible websites increases the likelihood that the general public will become aware of the consumer's complaint. If, for example, a person with many \\"followers\\" or \\"friends\\" publishes a complaint on social media, it may go \\"viral\\". Internet forums in general and on complaint websites have made it possible for individual consumers to hold large corporations accountable in a public forum.

He did well and was admitted to Makerere University to study for the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree. He graduated in 1978 and proceeded to the London School of Economics from where he graduated with the degree of Master of Laws (LLM), in 1982, at age 26. Military education General Kayihura has attended a number of military courses including the following: * The Army Command Course at the Army Commander College, in Nanjing, China * The Combined Arms Course * The Brigade/Battalion Commander's Course * The Conflict Resolution and Management Course at Nasser Military Academy, Cairo, Egypt * The Command and Staff Course at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama, United States, from 2000 to 2001. Public service In 1982, following his graduation from the University of London, he joined the National Resistance Army, a rebel outfit that fought the regime of Milton Obote II and captured power in 1986. He has since grown in military rank and held multiple offices in the army and public service, including the following: * As an Aide de Camp to the Commander of the Mobile Brigade, from 1982 to 1986. * As a Staff Officer in the Office of the Assistant Minister of Defence, from 1986 to 1988. * As Chief Political Commissar and simultaneous Director of Political Education in the National Resistance Army. * As the Operational Commander of the UPDF forces in Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo *As a Military Assistant to the President of Uganda. In that capacity, he headed the Anti-Smuggling Unit, whose official name is Special Revenue Police Services. He formerly served as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) of the Uganda Police Force. He had served in that position since 2005 when he replaced General Edward Katumba Wamala as the IGP. He was the second Ugandan military officer to serve as the chief of the Uganda Police Force, in the history of the country. General Kayihura is still an active member of Uganda's military and was previously the Head of the country's Revenue Protection Services. Controversies Kale Kayihura is largely perceived (amongst Uganda's political circles and a large section of the population) as working for and promoting Museveni's personal interests through squashing of Museveni's political opponents. During the 2016 general elections, he was behind the implementation of the controversial Public Order Management Act (POMA) which largely targeted opposition politicians and their rights to assemble. He has, in most cases appeared to be ruthless while dealing with opposition political protests. Kayihura infamously admitted before the media that he had sanctioned the beatings of supporters of Dr. Kizza Besigye, a leading opposition figure and four-time presidential candidate in Uganda. However, he later backtracked on his earlier statements due to public pressure and promised that the culprits (who had participated in the beatings) would face disciplinary action. A team of private lawyers also separately filed a criminal case against Kale Kayihura and other senior commanders for their involvement in the July 2016 beatings. Criminal summonses were issued by the magistrate court for the IGP and seven other senior officers to appear in court to answer charges of torture but none of them showed up in court. These proceedings were later halted by the controversial Deputy Chief Justice Steven Kavuma. On 13 June 2018, Kayihura was arrested on suspicion of killing police spokesman Andrew Felix Kaweesi in March 2017. Kale Kayihura appeared at the military court in Kampala, Uganda, on 24 August 2018. Uganda's former police chief, He was released on bail after 76 days in military custody on charges of failure to protect war materials and aiding and abetting kidnapping. Sacking as Inspector General of Police On 4 March 2018, President Yoweri Museveni elevated Martin Okoth Ochola, previously the deputy police chief, to Inspector General of Police, on the same day General Elly Tumwine replaced Lieutenant General Henry Tumukunde as Security Minister. This followed widespread outcry from concerned citizens, regarding increased insecurity in the country, with the police cavorting with known criminal gangs. Kidnappings-for-ransom, wanton murders and robberies, including a rash of unexplained tourist deaths; all un-solved, which left the security apparatus clue-less. Private life He is married to Angella Kayihura, a Kenyan of Rwandese descent. She is the grand-niece of Rudahigwa, the last king of pre-independence Rwanda. The Kayihuras are the parents of two children. He is reported to own a mixed farm on of land in Kabula, Lyantonde District, on which he owns about 500 goats. US Sanctions On 13 September 2019, Kayihura was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury for gross violation of Human rights when he was head of the Uganda Police Force (UPF). The sanctions relate to Kayihura's involvement in instructing the Flying Squad Unit to torture Ugandans at places such as the notorious Nalufenya Special Investigations Center (NSIC) in Jinja, Eastern Uganda. The sanctions press release states that,\\"As the IGP for the UPF, Kayihura led individuals from the UPF's Flying Squad Unit, which has engaged in the inhumane treatment of detainees at the Nalufenya Special Investigations Center (NSIC). Flying Squad Unit members reportedly used sticks and rifle butts to abuse NSIC detainees, and officers at NSIC are accused of having beaten one of the detainees with blunt instruments to the point that he lost consciousness. Detainees also reported that after being subjected to the abuse they were offered significant sums of money if they confessed to their involvement in a crime.\\" The statement further states that Kayihura's property owned in the US or by US Citizens will be blocked and must be reported, \\"As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of Kayihura, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by him alone or with other designated persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons, are blocked and must be reported to OFAC - Office of Foreign Assets Control.\\" See also * Uganda National Police * List of military schools in Uganda * Luke Kercan Ofungi *Kisoro District ReferencesExternal links * Kayihura Takes Mixed Score Card To Third Term *Sanctions: Former Ugandan Inspector General of Police for Role in Serious Human Rights Abuse and Corruption Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Ituri conflict Category:Ugandan generals Category:Ugandan police chiefs Category:Law enforcement in Uganda Category:People from Kisoro District Category:Ugandan military personnel Category:Makerere University alumni Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:People educated at St. Mary's College Kisubi Category:People sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act ","title":"Kale Kayihura"},{"id":"25840620","text":"Plaster spraying allows a plasterer to skim a drywall more than five times faster than using a hand float to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based plaster can be sprayed if it is \\"spray grade,\\" most plaster sprayers prefer the organic-based pre-mixed plaster packaged in a plastic bag because the plaster spraying machine does not need to be cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that plaster is kept moist. The pre-mixed plaster also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the plaster from powder. A drywall skimmed with pre-mixed plaster can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.  Equipment  Plaster sprayers are of four types:  Pneumatic Sprayer  Most common and simple to use. These sprayers have a hopper which holds the material which is connected to an air compressor. The air moves through the bottom of the hopper forcing the plaster out via the outputs on the wall. These tools generally are easy to clean and cost between $250 – US$300.  Worm-drive pump  These sprayers have a worm-drive pump like Utiform Quattro or Master that pumps the plaster up to a spray gun that has a large nozzle, usually 4 to 8 mm, that extrudes the plaster into a chamber on the end of the gun. In this chamber, compressed air is introduced to blast the plaster into a spray. Worm-drive pumps have a rubber stator which is not compatible with solvent-based materials.  Peristaltic pump  There are a few plaster sprayers that have a peristaltic pump (a tube squeezed by rollers) which also requires compressed air to produce a spray. These types of plaster sprayer can also spray textured coatings with particle sizes up to about 3mm diameter, providing that they are not solvent based.  Piston pump  Newer types of plaster sprayer have a piston pump, which has sufficient pressure to spray smooth (untextured) plaster without compressed air. Full airless pumps are sometimes used to spray smooth plaster, although they are not ideal as the flow rate is too low for volume projects; however, they can be used to spray solvent-based plasters. Air operated piston type supply pumps can put out as much as 27 gpm. Like the Graco Bulldog 10:1 at about 9 gpm and the Lincoln Pile driver 5:1 at about 27 gpm. These flow-rates are calculated at a maximum of 120 cfm air supply. Material supply hoses are medium pressure at about 600 psi. These pumps are material supply pumps only and additional air is required at the spray gun to propel the material to the surface. These guns are usually an internal mixture type guns where the material and air exits the gun together.  Finishing  When the plaster has been sprayed on the wall or ceiling, it is laid off with a wide spatula, typically 40 cm wide. This can be mounted on a pole for finishing the ceiling.

He is currently Associate Professor of English at Gordon College (Georgia). Biography Stephen Roger Powers was born in Madison, Wisconsin. He graduated from University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, with a PhD. He is the author of The Follower's Tale, a collection of bluegrass-inspired lyric and narrative poems about country music icon Dolly Parton and her theme park, Dollywood. The Follower's Tale was published by Salmon Poetry in 2009. Powers has also published numerous poems and short stories in a variety of journals and anthologies, including Shenandoah (magazine), Smartish Pace, and Red, White, and Blues: Poets on the Promise of America (University of Iowa Press). He has received two Pushcart Prize nominations for his fiction and poetry, and he has presented his work and his scholarship at the Modern Language Association (MLA), the Association of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP), and on Wisconsin Public Radio's Hotel Milwaukee program. On August 23, 2003, a sample of Powers' Hotel Milwaukee appearance was played just before \\"The National Anthem\\" during a Radiohead concert at Alpine Valley in East Troy, WI. Powers' voice can be heard on numerous bootleg recordings of the concert. The Follower's Tale Powers began work on The Follower's Tale in the fall of 2000 while a PhD student in the graduate creative writing program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The working title of the project was Chasing Dolly until it was changed to The Follower's Tale upon completion of the final draft in 2007. Salmon Poetry published the book in October 2009 with cover art by Dublin artist Maura Harmon. R. T. Smith, editor of Shenandoah, calls the book a \\"whirlwind of a collection,\\" and Dolly Parton offers an endorsement on the back cover. An early version of The Follower's Tale, much different from the published version, was named a semi-finalist for the Verse Prize in 2004 and was included in Powers' doctoral dissertation, a creative study of the relationship between performance and text entitled Kill Trevor Austen!. On October 1, 2009, to mark the publication of The Follower's Tale, Powers appeared at an All-Ireland Poetry Day reading with Irish poets Gerry Hanberry, Celeste Auge, and Jean Kavanagh at the Ennistymon Courthouse Gallery in Ennistymon, Ireland. Comedy From 2000-2008, Powers performed as a Milwaukee-based stand-up comedian using the stage name Trevor Austen. He appeared at clubs and casinos throughout the Midwest. Powers' last stand-up performance was in Wisconsin in the summer of 2008, when he retired the Trevor Austen persona to focus on his poetry and fiction writing. The Trevor Austen act centered on Powers' real-life hearing impairment. Even though he performed at several charity benefits he also drew some criticism from advocates of the deaf for playing up his disability for comedic effect instead of education and awareness. Powers, under the Austen name, was featured in Milwaukee Magazine and appeared on the cover of M Magazine in June 2004 with Tyler Kroll and Mel Miskimen, two other Milwaukee-area comedians.

Accessed 20 May 2013. in the late Sixties. In 1969, during his last year at art school, he became a founder member of the mixed media experimental theatre group Moving Being (director Geoff Moore), with whom he worked as designer and lighting and projection designer on all productions until 1978. Mumford moved to Cardiff with Moving Being in 1972, where he designed a temporary theatre space for the new Chapter Arts Centre. After that he continued to work with Moving Being on a project basis but began a wider based freelance career. In the late Seventies he became a part-time member of the faculty of the London Contemporary Dance School at The Place, teaching a course relating choreography to visual art and design and also at that time began collaborating with a number of choreographers in their early work at The Place, such as Siobhan Davies, Richard Alston, Ian Spink and many others. When the company Second Stride was formed in the early Eighties Peter was a founding collaborator as lighting designer - another working relationship that would last for nearly another decade. In the Eighties, Peter designed the lighting for a huge number of dance works for companies such as London Contemporary Dance Theatre, Rambert Dance Company, Second Stride, Siobhan Davies Dance Company and many other individual projects at that time. He also continued to design projects with Moving Being like the major site specific “Mabinogion” - first at Carnarvon Castle and later in Cardiff. His work gradually expanded into opera, designing sets/costumes and lighting for “Parsifal“ for Welsh National Opera in 1978 and then into drama more towards the end of the 1980s. The Overgrown Path at The Royal Court Theatre in 1985 was the first straight play he lit in London. In 1986 he co-founded Dancelines Productions, a film/TV production company committed to creating and producing dance for television. He produced and directed many programmes/films for Dancelines for both Channel 4 and BBC2 up until the mid- Nineties and during that period the work won many awards including OperaScreen IMZ 1991- Best New Work / DanceScreen 1992 - Best Studio Adaptation/ Video Danse Grand Prix 1994 - best series (Dance House) and an Emmy Award Nomination for the TV adaptation of Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake which Peter directed. The last real work in this area was the series “48 Preludes and Fugues” (Bach) for BBC2 in 2002 - 48 short films, of which Peter directed 24 and was lighting director on the rest. His work is now predominantly in the area of lighting design, but still designs sets on certain projects and most recently was Director of Photography for Francesca Zambello’s film of “The Little Prince”. He has directed on occasion in the theatre as well as film and television. Productions include “Hamletmachine” and “No, to the Yes-sayer” (Jasager/Neinsager); both at St. Stephens Theatrespace in Cardiff. “The Man with the Foot-soles of Wind”; Almeida Opera. “Earth and the Great Weather”; Almeida Opera. “ L’Heure Espangnol” & L’Enfant et Les Sortileges”; Opera Zuid. Work in the theatre nowadays, is spread fairly equally across drama, dance (ballet) and opera. Most recent work includes “Corybantic Games” (Royal Ballet); “John” (National Theatre, London); “My Name Is Lucy Barton” (The Bridge Theatre); “The Way Of The World\\" (Donmar Warehouse); “The Ferryman” (The Gielgud Theatre); “Long Day's Journey Into Night” (Wyndham's Theatre, London); “Carmen” (The Metropolitan Opera, New York).

It combines a story of a raid by British commandos into Germany during the Second World War with a science fiction story concerning a new Nazi aircraft capable of fantastic speeds, which shot down 150 Allied bombers during a bombing mission. The aircraft, which is silver and disc- shaped, may be constructed around an extraterrestrial artifact. Plot After hearing of the bomber raid disaster, Major Barton coerces the code word \\"Slipstream\\" from a German prisoner via torture, after which the prisoner dies. He persuades his commander to authorize, or at least turn a blind eye to, a commando raid on an experimental aircraft development site in Germany, where the Slipstream seems to have been built. The target is located between advancing American and Russian forces, who have their own agendas and may reach it before the British. Barton kidnaps Kate Ritchie, a research scientist whose brother may have been lost in one of the bombing raids. His men arrange for a prisoner-of-war, Flugkapitän Jürgen Rahl, to escape and then fall into his hands. Jürgen is a former test pilot who was captured when his Messerschmitt Me 262 was shot down. Barton recruits Jürgen by promising to save his father from the advancing Russians, though he later admits he has no plans to do so. Jürgen is to fly the Slipstream back to Britain once it has been captured. In Germany the raiders enter an underground factory, the Mittelwerk where they find slave workers, a German \\"technician\\", Frau Schenk, and the mysterious Slipstream in a cave. Jürgen finds that piloting the aircraft is a matter of wearing a helmet and controlling it with his thoughts. Unfortunately previous pilots have died of brain inflammation after a few missions. Determined to secure the Slipstream for Britain, Barton and his men are utterly ruthless in their quest. They ambush and destroy an American squad who come to the factory. Kate and Jürgen learn what they can about the Slipstream. It seems to be built around an alien artifact that crashed into the Brazilian jungle in 1929. It was taken by the German SS after a German priest working in the Vatican learned of its existence from a missionary. The artifact is intelligent and Jürgen learns to communicate with it. It is apparently designed to teach advanced science, not destroy life. The other pilots died because they were forcing it to take part in war, against its programming. As the Americans and Russians close in, Jürgen is able to pilot the ship back to Britain with Kate and Barton aboard, leaving Barton's second- in-command behind to hold off the attackers as long as possible. However once the war is over, politics take over and the Slipstream has to be handed over to the Americans. The British have been unable to study it because it will not fly for any of their pilots. They bring Jürgen back for one final attempt before the craft is handed over. He takes off into outer space, apparently to find the artifact's creators.

The film was released on May 3, 1991 and starred John Stamos as a biker turned military Corporal. Synopsis Colonel James E. Devers's (Sandy McPeak) newly converted motorcycle unit has had a lot of experience riding horses, but not much riding motorcycles. Enter Grady Westfall (John Stamos), a biker faced with the choice of prison or teaching the military how to ride. Grady quickly proves to be a headache for Colonel James E. Devers (Sandy McPeak), who dislikes both Grady's unorthodox methods and his interest in his daughter Beryl Ann (Teri Polo). But when Grady discovers that his unit is ill equipped to launch a rescue mission in Spain, he decides to accompany his unit in the hopes of increasing their chance of succeeding in the dangerous mission.

Since the end of the war up until its subsequent century, the Cold War had many effects on nation- states and targeted them in many economical and social ways, for example in Russia, military spending was cut dramatically since 1991 creating a decline in the Soviet Union’s military-industrial sector. Such a dismantling left millions of employees (throughout the former Soviet Union) unemployed thus affecting Russia’s economy and militaryÅslund, p. 49 After Russia embarked on several economic reformations in the 1990s, it underwent a financial crisis and a recession more oppressive than the United States and Germany experienced during the Great Depression. Although Russian living standards worsened overall in the post–Cold War years, the economy held an overwhelming growth after 1995 and in early 2005 it became known that it had returned to its 1989 levels of per-Capita GDP. The Cold War has continued to influence global politics after its end, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the post–Cold War world is widely considered as unipolar—with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War defined the political role of the United States in the post–World War II world: by 1989 the United States held military alliances with 50 countries and had 1.5 million troops posted abroad in 117 countries which institutionalized a global commitment to huge, permanent peacetime military-industrial complexes and large-scale military funding of science. Military expenditures by the US during the Cold War years were estimated to have been $8 trillion, while nearly 100,000 Americans lost their lives in the Korean War and Vietnam War. In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; the incidence of interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and Disagreements between the leaders of the nations that were affected by the warfare declined sharply in the post–Cold War years. The legacy of the Cold War conflict is not easily erased as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by Communist governments has produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and a large increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, the annulment of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union the Cold War had been officially terminated, but despite it all, military development and spending continued, particularly in the deployment of nuclear- armed ballistic missiles and defensive systems, because there was no formalized treaty ending the Cold War, the former superpowers have continued to various degrees to maintain and even improve or modify existing nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Moreover, other nations not previously acknowledged as nuclear-weapons states have developed and tested nuclear- explosive devices. The risk of nuclear and radiological terrorism by possible sub-national organizations or individuals is now a concern. Radiation legacies US radiation warning symbol Due to the military and non-military exploitation of nuclear fission, the Cold War brought forth some significant involuntary exposures to high-level radiation. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused large-scale destruction as well as an acute and lingering radiation throughout the infected areas, and as a result of decades of nuclear-weapons production, experimentation, and testing, exposure to radiation above normal background levels occurred to scientists, technicians, military personnel, civilians, and animals. Several significant radiation- related accidents occurred at military and civilian nuclear reactors and facilities, causing direct fatalities, as well as involuntary occupational and public exposures. Unfortunately, these consequences did not detain the E.E.U.U. and the U.R.S.S. from accumulating a large number of missiles and nuclear weapons thus exacerbating tensions between asymmetrical powers. Many nuclear legacies can be identified from the Cold War, such as the availability of new technologies for nuclear power and energy, such legacies which created great tensions between superpowers back then, especially since the hegemony of the world was disputed between the United States and the Soviet Union. Environmental remediation, industrial production, research science, and technology development have all benefited from the carefully managed application of radiation and other nuclear processes. Security legacies Due to the potential risk to national and international security, nuclear- weapons states have inherited substantial responsibilities in protecting and stabilizing their nuclear forces. During the Cold War and post-Cold War periods, nuclear weapons and their delivery systems had been immensely secured and protected over the fear that such weapons of mass destruction were stolen, thus nuclear facilities and devices, such as reactors and propulsion systems, were safeguarded. An appropriate continuing level of security remained necessary through all life-cycle phases, from production to decommissioning as the entire military nuclear infrastructure requires protection, and that requires a commensurate allocation of funding. Having once had widespread overseas nuclear bases and facilities, both the United States and the former Soviet Union inherited particular responsibilities and costs. Moreover, all nuclear-weapons states had developed not only production and service facilities but sometimes in extensive military staging and storage. World inventories of weapons-grade fissile materials are substantial, much greater than now needed for military purposes. Until these materials can be demilitarized, they need to be securely safeguarded to evade risks of deliberate, accidental, or unauthorized nuclear devastation. Moreover, terrorists and hackers continue to interfere with nuclear stability and confidence. Military legacies Internal national-security military postures still dominate behavior among sovereign nations, and as the former superpowers did not formally consummate their stand-down from Cold War military equipment the strategic and tactical nuclear and conventional forces remain at levels comparatively high for a peacetime environment. Localized conflicts/tensions replaced the former bilateral nuclear confrontation and as a lingering result, large inventories of nuclear weapons and facilities remain stabilized. Some facilities are being recycled, dismantled, or recovered as valuable substances as well as some chemical and biological weapons that were developed during the Cold War are still in existence, although many are being demilitarized. Military policies and strategies are slowly being modified to reflect the increasing interval without major confrontation and because of the large extent of inventories on weapons, fissile materials, and rapid-response delivery systems, a mutual danger coexists for accidental, misjudged, or miscalculated incidents or warfare. Other Cold War weapons states are slowly reducing their arsenals because they have not abandoned their dependency on nuclear deterrence. While a few more nations have attempted or succeeded in carrying out nuclear-explosive tests and thus creating their own nuclear deterrence. During the Cold War, an international fabric of arms-control constraint had evolved, much of it carried over as a beneficial heritage with institutional mechanisms for multilateral or international function and verification. Institutional legacies Aside from the tangible measures of national defense, such as standing military and security forces and hardware, they are various institutional structures of government and functionality that have less to do directly with military or security factors, but more to do with underlying public attitudes and risks. These institutional structures and perceptions have had their own challenges and adjustments after the Cold War. Strong impressions were made and continue to affect the national psyche as a result of close brushes with all-out nuclear warfare. In some cases, this had resulted in an aversion to warfare, in other cases to callousness regarding nuclear threats. Peaceful applications of nuclear energy received a stigma which is still too difficult to exercise as it heightens the fear of nuclear risk which can result in resistance to military drawdown. Public impressions and insecurities gained during the Cold War could carry over to the peacetime environment. This new peaceful era created a territorial expansion of democratic capitalism which had an open invitation to proclaim the obsolescence of the war itself. Several foreign states built specific institutions of democracy in post-communist areas with the wide belief that it would favor peaceful conflict resolution as wars did not occur in democracies. This exacerbated the idea of having a ‘democracy equaled having peace,’ surged across the nations affected by the Cold War and became a popular opinion across international relation experts because peace laid in the political strength(democracy) of the sovereignty of the people. After the tensions of the Cold War diminished, the United Nations commenced an extensive journey marked by the sole objective to analyze, reflect and debate in detail around those issues related to aid the advocates for Human Rights and the creation of the construction of a perfect society that lives in a culture involving peace around foreign nations (a utopia-like fantasy). With the end of communism (the Soviet Union collapsed due to its economic weaknesses), German unification, and even the expected separation of Czechoslovakia everything Historical occurred with immense rapidness. Therefore, the end of the twentieth century will always be marked as the start of widespread peace, in Europe, Western countries, and beyond. Economic legacies After the end of World War II in 1945, Europe faced great difficulties in achieving an economic, political and social recovery. Although historians and scholars maintain different positions regarding what were the causes that led to the development of the Cold War and its effects they all concur the tensions between the superpowers that had already been accumulating during this period where the spark that ignited the flame. Such tensions were described by the immense separation between the capitalist and communist countries, the latter having an economy planned by the state, and the capitalists pursuing the idea of a free market economy. The Potsdam Agreement made the Allies to divide Germany into two large blocks, each led by the most powerful nations of the moment—Russia, Great Britain and the United States. The United States, along with Great Britain, represented the western bloc and the capitalist system whilst the Soviet Union was given the eastern bloc and expanded their communist system. Thus creating a huge fiscal mortgage placed on many domestic economies, as financial obligations included those necessary to avoid further dislocations while the change took place from a wartime footing to a peacetime environment. The most important social causes are due to economic influence which caused national military establishments and alliances to be reconfigured. Highly dependent institutional frameworks were to be restructured, and new obligations were acquired by nations that were once bystanders to the East-West confrontation.

Rogge was one of the few German flag rank officers who was not arrested by the Allies after the war, due to his conduct as a military officer. After eighteen months of successful raids, Atlantis is sunk on 22 November 1941 by the British cruiser Devonshire.

They are known to be structural components of a variety of human tissues, including cartilage, and also play key roles in neural development and glial scar formation. They are known to be involved in certain cell processes, such as cell adhesion, cell growth, receptor binding, cell migration, and interaction with other extracellular matrix constituents. They are also known to interact with laminin, fibronectin, tenascin, and collagen. CSPGs are generally secreted from cells. Importantly, CSPGs are known to inhibit axon regeneration after spinal cord injury. CSPGs contribute to glial scar formation post injury, acting as a barrier against new axons growing into the injury site. CSPGs play a crucial role in explaining why the spinal cord doesn't self-regenerate after an injury. General structure Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are composed of a core protein and a sugar side chain. The core protein is generally a glycoprotein, and the side chains are glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sugar chains attached through a covalent bond. The GAG side chains are of different lengths depending on the CSPG. Each GAG chain consists of a linear pattern of alternating monosaccharide units: uronic acid and either N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine. Types The following CSPGs have been identified: *Aggrecan (CSPG1) *Versican (CSPG2) *Neurocan (CSPG3) *CSPG4 (melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, NG2) *CSPG5 *SMC3 (CSPG6, structural maintenance of chromosomes 3) *Brevican (CSPG7) *CD44 (CSPG8, cluster of differentiation 44) *Phosphacan Neurocan, brevican, versican, and aggrecan all share similar N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Neural development CSPGs play an active role in the neural development of postnatal babies. During development, CSPGs act as guidance cues for developing growth cones. CSPGs guide growth cones through the use of negative signals, as seen by the fact that growing axons avoid CSPG dense areas. Tests done on embryonic roof plates, located on the dorsal midline of developing spinal cords, support this. CSPGs were found near and around the embryonic roof plates that inhibited axon elongation through the spinal cord, and directed the axons in another direction, but were absent in roof plates that attracted axon elongation. These results suggest that CSPGs act in neural development as an inhibitory signal to help guide growing axons. Spinal cord injury CSPGs have been implicated in inhibiting axonal regeneration and neurogenesis after central nervous system injury. CSPGs are known to be part of the glial scar that forms post injury, acting as a barrier to prevent axon extension and regrowth, preventing regrowth up to 82%. Studies examining CSPG (neurocan, brevican, phosphacan, and versican) levels before spinal cord injury and after spinal cord injury indicate that there is a large up- regulation of these CSPGs after injury is induced, suggesting this up- regulation helps to inhibit axon growth. Neurocan, brevican, and versican levels are up-regulated as early as one day post injury, and all of these levels peak at 2 weeks post injury. These CSPG levels all returned to normal roughly 4 weeks post injury. Phosphacan showed no up-regulation one day post injury, and did not have any significant up-regulation until 4 weeks. Phosphacan levels peaked 8 weeks post injury. These results suggest that these four CSPGs work together to inhibit neurogenesis. Regulation=Inhibition of EGFR inhibits CSPGs Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been suggested to regulate CSPG function. Inhibiting EGFR has been shown to block the activities of certain CSPGs, including neurocan, phosphacan, versican, and aggrecan. When EGFR was inactive, CSPGs had little effect on neurons. As a result, neurogenesis occurred, with significantly longer and many more neurons forming than seen with EGFR active. When EGFR is active, CSPG functioned normally, restricting neurogenesis. Drugs manipulating EGFR may be helpful in preventing the adverse effects CSPGs have during spinal cord injury. PTP- sigma is a CSPG receptor PTP-sigma (a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase) is a recently discovered receptor for CSPGs, and is important for proper CSPG function. PTP-sigma binds with very high affinity to CSPGs, specifically neurocan and aggrecan. To simulate more physiological situations, researchers looked at PTP-sigma effects on spinal cord injury sites in mice. Mice with induced spinal cord injury lacking PTP-sigma showed significantly more axon regrowth, with normal amounts of CSPG present. This suggests that without PTP-sigma, CSPGs cannot bind to anything to function properly at the site of a glial scar. Because PTP-sigma is a functional receptor for CSPGs and promotes proper function of CSPGs, drugs manipulating PTP-sigma may help patients suffering from spinal cord injury. Interferon-gamma Interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) is a cytokine that is useful against fighting bacterial infections and helping to suppress tumors. It has also been shown to be beneficial in decreasing CSPG expression after spinal cord injury. Using immunohistochemistry, scientists have shown that CSPGs at the site of spinal cord injury in mice were significantly decreased when treated with IFN-gamma compared to mice without IFN-gamma treatments. Control mice had 80% more levels of CSPGs after spinal cord injury compared to mice treated with IFN- gamma, and scientists suggest that IFN-gamma works by inhibiting mRNA expression. Rho/ROCK pathway mediates CSPGs The CSPG inhibition of axon regrowth and neurogenesis post spinal cord injury has been shown to be associated with the rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. Studies have shown that when CSPGs inhibit axon growth in the glial scar, the ROCK pathway is activated. However, using C3 transferase and Y27632, two inhibitors of the ROCK signaling pathway, researchers showed that neurogenesis and new neuron length both significantly increased. With C3 transferase, there was a 57% increase in new neuron length, and Y27632 produced a 77% increase in length. Neurogenesis was greatly improved, but not quantifiable. Deactivating the ROCK pathway greatly decreased CSPG inhibition of axon regrowth. These results indicate that the CSPG effect of neurogenesis inhibition is mediated through the ROCK pathway. In disease Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. Alzheimer's The two primary markers of Alzheimer's disease are neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques (SP). Studies have shown that CSPGs are present in the frontal cortex and hippocampus NFTs and SPs of postmortem brains of Alzheimer's patients. CSPG-4 and CSPG-6 are both localized on the perimeter of NFTs and SPs, and were also found on dystrophic neurons as well. Given CSPGs inhibitory effects, these results suggest that CSPGs play an important role in Alzheimer's Disease progression, and could be responsible for facilitating the regression of neurons around NFTs and SPs. Medications that target the CSPGs in the NFT and SP may help to alleviate some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Stroke A stroke is a sudden loss of brain function due to either a blood clot or blood leakage in the brain. Often, a stroke seriously debilitates the patient. However, in those patients that do regain some brain function in affected areas, down-regulations of CSPGs are shown to occur. After stroke, plasticity occurs in some regions of the brain and is associated with some return of brain function. Rats that were able to recover from induced stroke had down-regulations of several CSPGs, including aggrecan, versican, and phosphacan Rats that did not return any brain function did not have significant down-regulation of CSPGs. The reduction of CSPGs in rats that returned some brain function after stroke suggest that more neurological connections could be made with less CSPGs present. Medications that are able to down-regulate CSPGs may help return more brain function to stroke patients. Epilepsy Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive neurological activity in the brain, causing seizures. Researchers have observed that CSPGs are somewhat removed from the brain in epilepsy patients. Research has shown a decrease in phosphacan in both the temporal lobe and the hippocampus in epilepsy cases, suggesting that there CSPGs play a role in the control of axonal regrowth.

As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859. General Geffrard succeeded him as President. Soon afterwards, the Emperor and his family arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, where they remained for several years. Allowed to return to Haiti, Faustin died at Petit-Goâve on 6 August 1867 and was buried at Fort Soulouque.

Todd Gaston is the Senior Pastor of the church.  About  Mt. Ararat Baptist Church has frequently hosted events helpful to the local public, such as the Weekday Preschool Program,http://childcarecenter.us/provider_detail/mt_ararat_baptist_church_stafford_va classes with Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University,http://www.daveramsey.com/fpu/locations/org/9679/class/202137 events where they've given clothes to people in need, and others.  History  Mount Ararat Church was founded in the fall of 1907. During that time, a few men banded together in an empty field and decided to establish a church. One of the men donated land, and together the men built a small building and a cemetery. During the early years of the church, the Baptist Church of Toluca, later renamed Mt Ararat Baptist Church only had part-time pastors. Because the quality of the roads were low, Sunday School only met from April to Christmas. In 1942, the U.S. Government bought extra land to enlarge the [Quantico Marine Base], and much growth began to take place within Mt. Ararat. Along with new members came the inevitable need for more space, and the original building was enlarged by adding an entrance and Sunday School classrooms. The first full- time pastor was called in 1953. This was an important event for Mt Ararat Baptist church; Soon after a full-time pastor was enlisted, a full schedule of Sunday morning, evening, and Wednesday evening services were held, and a choir was also established. Soon after this, the first parsonage was constructed, and the sanctuary was enlarged. Later in the 1970s, as long-distance communication became popular, housing development became more frequent surrounding the church area. Mt. Ararat responded to this by purchasing more land for recreation and parking, and adding a new Sunday School wing and a new parsonage. In the 1980s the church sanctuary was expanded. In the 1990s more space was needed to keep up with the pace at which new members were joining the church; new modular units were purchased to increase the space needed for Sunday school. The current pastor is Todd Gaston.  Ministers/Pastors - Past/Present  *SENIOR PASTORS *Rev. A.T. Lynn September 1907 - August 1909 *Rev. James E. Jett September 1909 - May 1933 *Rev. Lloyd B.

It is our sole authority for discerning and putting into practice God's Will. The Bible is a perfect revelation from God which points us to the Living Word, Jesus Christ. God's Word is truth and leads men and women to salvation. * GOD - There is one living and true God who reveals Himself to us in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. This triune nature comprises one Supreme Being who is omnipotent, eternal, holy, and infinitely loving. To Him, we owe our highest obedience, reverence, and love. * JESUS CHRIST - Jesus of Nazareth is the incarnation of Almighty God. The Bible says that \\"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\\" (John 1:14). Jesus was completely God and completely man, miraculously born of a virgin. He is the earthly son of a heavenly Father and the heavenly son of an earthly mother. Jesus came to reveal God to mankind and to offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of the world when He died on a cross. God raised Him from the dead on the third day in order to prove that Jesus was victorious over sin, death, and hell. After 40 days the risen Lord ascended into heaven, and He will come again in power and glory in order to bring this world to a triumphant conclusion. * THE HOLY SPIRIT - The Holy Spirit is the active Presence of God in the world and in the hearts and lives of God's people. The spirit of God brings about conviction of sin and brings about regeneration, or a new birth, in the hearts and lives of believers. Also, the Holy Spirit empowers the Christian to live out his/her faith, provides assurance of salvation for the believer, and bestows upon the believer spiritual gifts for ministry. * MANKIND - Mankind was created by God in His own image. This means that men and women have dominion over the earth, they have the ability to choose right from wrong, and they have the opportunity to relate to God and to one another. Because of their \\"free will\\" all people choose to sin against God and, therefore, are separated from God. People cannot overcome their sin on their own and be reconciled with God. Rather, they must totally depend upon the saving power of God. We are created in the image of Adam and Eve and have received their sin nature. Jesus is the \\"new Adam\\" who did not sin against God. It is through Him that we take on a new nature in which our sins are forgiven and cleansed. * SALVATION - The Bible says, \\"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\\" (Romans 3:23). Also, the Bible says, \\"the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\\" (Romans 6:23). Sin separates us from God, and there is no way that we can get rid of all the sin in our life. There is nothing that we can do in order to overcome this terrible plight. Fortunately, God loves us, and He sent Jesus into the world in order to solve our sin problem for us. Because of His love for us, Jesus died on a cross, as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. The Bible tells how Jesus took our sins upon Himself; He took the punishment for our sins. Therefore, salvation (forgiveness of sin and a personal relationship with God) is a gift provided for everyone by God. However, we must receive that gift by placing our faith in Christ and surrendering to Jesus as Lord. Salvation is purely a gift of God's grace which we receive by faith. Then, we are reconciled with God and will live in heaven with Jesus for all eternity. Also, He will live with us in this life through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. * THE CHURCH - A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus is a local body of baptized believers who gather together in order to carry out the mission of Christ on earth. The purposes of the church are to build up believers in their faith through worship, Bible study and fellowship, and then to spread the Good News and the love of Christ throughout the world through evangelism, ministry, and missions. Every Christian is a minister, and every Christian has spiritual gifts to be used in the ministry of the church. The Biblical ordinances of the church are believer's baptism and the Lord's Supper. Baptism does not provide salvation but is a strong symbol of the salvation which has already been received by a person. That is why we insist upon baptism by immersion because this method symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. As a believer, we bury our old life with Christ and then we are raised to a new life with Him. Baptism by immersion is a wonderful way for the believer to share this symbolic testimony. The Lord's Supper is also a powerful symbol for the sacrifice of Christ and the salvation which He provides. This ordinance is a reminder to us of our fellowship with Christ and with one another. Church membership is an important way to share your commitment to Christ through a local body of believers. In joining Mount Ararat, a Christian is making a commitment to help us achieve the mission which God has given to us of making a difference for Christ in our community.

Cone was responsible for selling Iris printers and providing his own methodology of training to more than 40 Giclée studios in the USA including David Adamson Editions, Muse-X Editions, Hunter Editions, Donald SafTech, Jamie Cook, and many others. In 1995, Cone began development of his quad-black inkjet printing method for producing fine black-and-white photographs. By replacing the four conventional CMYK color inks of the IRIS 3047 printer with his own formulation of four monochromatic shades of black ink and developing software and lookup tables, Cone produced photographs that were replicants of platinum/palladium printing. Cone found that three shades of black were needed to convey continuous tone, and a fourth monochromatic ink could be used for split toning, a process of allowing a photograph to appear warmer through the shadows. Cone called this invention DigitalPlatinum for IRIS. The most notable project produced with this technique was Diana Michener's Solitaire for Peter MacGill in 1997. Cone developed his first color ink jet formulation ConeTech WGFA inksWilhelm, Henry: The Intimate Relationship of Inks and Papers: You Can't Talk About the Permanence of One Without Considering the Other Oct 29, 1999. in order to realize the brighter gamut needs for photographer Richard Avedon. Cone would print the Avedon portfolio \\"In Memory of Mr. & Mrs. Confort: A Fable in 24 Episodes, as well as Gordon Parks color prints for the Corcoran Gallery of Art Parks retrospective: Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon Parks. Cone continued the use of the Iris printer into the next millennium producing Botanica MagnificaShipley, Jonathan: The Botanist's Desire Fine Books and Collections Magazine, July/August, 2008 in 2007 for the Smithsonian's rare book collection, a double-elephant sized suite of 5 books depicting photographer Jonathan M. Singer's rare botanical photography. In 2009, Cone began collaborating with photographer Zana Briski printing black & white Iris prints of Briski's new insects portraits. In 1999, Cone introduced a commercial monochromatic black- and-white printing system of inks and ICC profiles for the Epson 3000 printer that allowed photographers to produce a wide range of monochromatic tones from warm to cool using archival color inks and ICC profiles for Somerset Velvet paper. This was the first inexpensive quad-black system to be released by ConeTech. From 2002 until 2008, Cone would develop and introduce higher standards of monochromatic ink jet products for Epson printers including PiezoTone (2002), PiezographyBW ICC (2004), Piezography iQuads (2005), Piezography K7 (2006), Piezography MPS (2008). In 2006, Cone introduced a new concept in ink formulation by developing an ink set for Epson printers that was \\"color-managed\\" during formulation by matching the color gamut produced by the OEM's printer driver, rather than attempting to imitate single ink positions that would later be controlled by ICC profiles. ConeColor inks are compatible with Epson Ultrachrome ink sets, being designed for use with the OEM driver, OEM workflow and OEM ICC profiles. Cone often traveled to New York City from 2006 to 2008 to collaborate with photographer/filmmaker Gregory Colbert and Mark Sobczak, Colbert's master printer, along with his studio assistants to refine a process that was used primarily to produce original works for Colbert's Ashes and Snow Nomadic Museum. Cone developed a part of the process, which was a system of 11 monochromatic Piezography inks and software developed by Cone in his East Topsham, Vermont studio and transposed to Roland DG AJ-1000 110-inch printers to produce triple split-tone black&white; photographs on 2.4m × 5.7m sheets of Japanese handmade paper produced by Awagami\\"Awagami News: Our new project for a work of Gregory Colbert for the Ashes and Snow Nomadic Museum exhibitions in Tokyo and in Mexico City which attracted more than 8.5 million visitors, making it the most attended exhibition by a living artist in history.\\"El Mañana: Acaba Museo Nómada su peregrinar (April 28,2008)\\" .

History The station began as Stonehaven Community Radio well over a decade ago.History of Mearns FM (archive) After a break the group reformed as Mearns FM which started broadcasting in the summer of 2009. Community Radio in the Mearns area began in 1993 following a visit to North East Community Radio by some members of the Stonehaven Community Centre Management Committee. A steering group was formed and Stonehaven Community Radio was formed. It transmitted for the first time during July 1994 from the old primary school toilet block in Stonehaven Community Centre. At that time community stations could only operate for 28 days at a time. In 2004 five year community radio licences were introduced and a few enthusiasts decided to call a meeting. Around 30 people turned and up and a small group was formed to take the project forward. A draft constitution was adopted at the first AGM which was held in the late Summer of 2005. The project was delayed because a round of broadcasting applications had just closed and Ofcom, the regulating authority, did not invite new applications until the late autumn of 2006. It was necessary for the organisation to become a Company Limited by Guarantee and a registered charity. The committee originally planned the station to be named Stonehaven Community Radio but it was decided to become Mearns wide and be called Mearns FM. Because of the large geographical area of the Mearns the station applied for three transmitters which Ofcom subsequently agreed to and a licence was issued in early July 2007. 6 June. 2009 was chosen for the station's launch as it coincided with the annual Stonehaven Feein' Market.

Fossils are known from the Early Jurassic Lower Lufeng Formation in Yunnan, China and belong to the type and only species, P. hsui. Description The skull of Platyognathus is small, being about in length. The snout is narrow and shorter than the remainder of the skull, as indicated by the anterior position of the antorbital fenestra. Two teeth, dentaries 5 and 6, are enlarged into caniniforms in the lower jaw. Paired caniniform teeth are not seen in any other described crocodyliform taxa, but they have been recorded from an unidentified crocodyliform from the Lower Jurassic Kayenta Formation and from a protosuchid from the Lower Jurassic McCoy Brook Formation in Nova Scotia. History and classification=Holotype Platyognathus was first named by Chung-Chien Young in 1944 on the basis of a partial lower jaw found from the Dark Red Beds of the Lower Lufeng Formation in 1939. The material was first mentioned briefly four years earlier in a paper on Lufeng fossil vertebrates. The holotype jaw consisted of 11 alveoli (tooth sockets) on the left side and 12 alveoli on the right side, in addition to one broken caniniform tooth. Several diagnostic features were mentioned, including an expansion at the tip of the jaw, a tooth cross section that is octangular in outline, and a lateral constriction of the jaw behind the caniniform tooth, which is followed by an expansion further back. The anterior teeth are small and angled forward, while there is evidence in the jaw of at least two caniniform teeth that were larger and oriented obliquely and anteriorly. Further back in the jaw, the posterior teeth are about the same size and project vertically. The entire jaw is well ossified, and sutures between the bones could not be identified in the holotype. The symphysis, the point where the two sides of the jaw come together, is represented by a broad ventral groove. Based on these features, Young found no close similarities between the jaw of Platyognathus and any other known early crocodylomorph such as Notochampsa, Sphenosuchus, Erythrochampsa, and Pedeticosaurus (at the time, these crocodylomorphs were collectively known as the \\"Pseudosuchia\\"). The jaw of Protosuchus richardsoni, described by Barnum Brown in 1933 from Arizona, is similar in size to that of Platyognathus, although it lacks many of the distinguishing features of the Asian form as described by Young. Because Platyognathus differed from any other known pseudosuchian, Young suggested that it may belong to its own family. During World War II, the holotype was either lost or destroyed. The classification of the genus continued to be debated, as descriptions of the fragmentary jaw were all that was available to study. Platyognathus continued to be referred to Pseudosuchia in the following years, and was suggested to have a close relationship with Sphenosuchus. In 1955, it was suggested to have affinities with aetosaurs, and in 1956 Alfred Romer tentatively assigned it to the Notochampsidae (later synonymized with Protosuchidae). New material CUP 2083 in the Field Museum of Natural History. In 1965, additional specimens from the Lower Lufeng were referred to Platyognathus. It was placed in a new pseudosuchian family, the Platyognathidae, and was considered to be intermediate between Pseudosuchia and Protosuchia. Most later studies of Platyognathus were based on one specimen of the new material known as CUP 2083 which preserved the lower jaw. Some of these studies concluded that Platyognathus was a pseudosuchian related to Sphenosuchus and Pedeticosaurus, but most considered it to be a protosuchian. One 1986 study also considered the material to be from a protosuchian, but did not consider CUP 2083 to be from Platyognathus because the mandibular symphysis was elongate and unfused, unlike the holotype described by Young which was ossified. Later that year, a new paper also concluded that the newer material did not represent Platyognathus, but considered the specimens and Platyognathus to belong to different basal crocodyliform taxa of uncertain affinities. In that paper, the validity of P. hsui was questioned on the basis of Young's description of the holotype Neotype In 1996, a newly described partial skull known as IVPP V8266 that was referable to Platyognathus was designated as a neotype. It was collected in 1984 from the Lower Lufeng in Yunnan. The authors of the paper that described the neotype agreed with the previous studies that the material described in 1965 does not belong to Platyognathus because CUP 2083 lacks many of the features of the holotype. In CUP 2083, the mandibular symphysis is unfused, there is a single caniniform tooth in the dentary, and there is no groove along the symphysis. This contrasts with the holotype, which has a fused symphysis, at least two caniniform teeth, and a conspicuous trough along the symphysis. The authors also mention that the holotype and CUP 2083 come from two different strata within the \\"Dark Red Beds\\" of the Lower Lufeng; the holotype is from stratum 6 of the Dahuangtian locality while CUP 2083 is from stratum 5 of the Dadi locality, about 400m southeast of the Dahuangtian locality. This shows that the two specimens are from different horizons and are likely to belong to different taxa. The new skull revealed an additional diagnostic feature of Platyognathus that distinguishes it from other protosuchians: the distinctive curvature of the jugal. Additional diagnostic characters were proposed by the authors, but their character-states cannot be determined in other protosuchian taxa. These characters include a width of the mandibular symphysis across the swellings of the caniniform teeth that is almost equal to the anteroposterior length of the symphysis and an anterolateral process of the ectopterygoid with an inverted V-shaped ridge on the dorsal surface. The shortness of the snout relative to the rest of the skull and the presence of a laterally and ventrally open notch between the premaxilla and maxilla indicate that Platyognathus is a member of Protosuchia as defined by Wu et al. (1994). Because the infratemporal fenestra of Platyognathus is very small and the mandibular symphysis extends posteriorly to the level of the seventh to ninth tooth, the genus is thought to be more derived than Orthosuchus. The authors of the description of the neotype suggested that Platyognathus may be closely related to the clade containing Protosuchidae and Shantungosuchus because it possesses a dentary tooth that fits into a notch between the premaxilla and maxilla. Because Platyognathus is known from such incomplete material, there is yet to be an adequate cladistic analyses that can determine a phylogenetic position for Platyognathus within Protosuchia. An unnamed mesosuchian from the Salt Wash Member of the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of western Colorado in the United States possesses several features that are also seen in Platyognathus. The dentition of the mesosuchian is similar to that of Platyognathus and like Platyognathus, the dentary is laterally expanded. However, the dentary of the unnamed mesosuchian is much broader and spatulate.

History  The history of this small village with its about 950 inhabitants which is situated on the rim of the Franconian Swiss dates back to the far past. The area of Rüsselbach was already settled in the Bronze Age. This is witnessed by the tumulis in the close-by Eichenlohe-copse. Above Rüsselbach, on the so-called „Katz“, one still can see the defense system of a robber-knight’s castle called Hainburg from the early Middle Ages. Local historians date the colonization on the left shores of the river Schwabach back to the time around 900 a.c.. Although some people claim that Rüsselbach was already founded as early as in 742 a.c., which corresponds with the foundation of the diocese Eichstätt, to which Rüsselbach belonged in the beginning, the first proven reference in a document was only in 1010 a.c. in a deed of emperor Henry II. The parish of Kirchrüsselbach situated at half height right in the middle of the two hills “Katz” and “Kuhberg” with its church that was hallowed to the apostle Jacob and is now an Protestant-Lutheran fortified church, consisted already of 40 villages those days. Although the lordship above Rüsselbach changed several times throughout the following centuries, the size of the parish remained unchanged. The following changes in lordship are known: * 1010 bestowal of the area from emperor Henry II to the diocese Bamberg * Later the ownership was passed to the Staufer * 1109 ownership passend on to the noble men of Wildenstein * from 1268 together with Hiltpoltstein under the rule of the Wittelsbacher * 1353 bailment of the parish to the Bohemian King Charles IV * 1503 acquisition of the biggest part of Rüsselbach through the free imperial city of Nuremberg The oldest building in Rüsselbach is still the fortified church in Kirchrüsselbach. The frescoes in the sanctuary are said to be from around 1200 a.c.. The Protestant-Lutheran church received its nowadays face with its remodelling during the years 1777 and 1779. The baptistry derives from the year 1841, the altar-piece from the year 1842. On 1 January 1972 Rüsselbach became part of the municipality of Igensdorf and lost its autonomy.  Rüsselbach today  Today Rüsselbach is a rural village in the catchment area of the metropol region of Nuremberg. Most of its population is commuting to the surrounding bigger cities. Retail sellers are no longer at place. Only one pub of formerly up to six ones survived until today. Only a handful of farmyards are still active in farming, and then only in sideline. Oberrüsselbach with its high view over the valley has a big community of artists and creative people. Rüsselbach, as a part of the municipality of Igensdorf, belongs to European’s leading cherry-cultivating area. Once a year Oberrüsselbach hosts a Japanese cherry blossom feast. On the plateau above Rüsselbach the gliding airfield of Lauf-Lillinghof is situated.  Anniversary 2010  2010 Rüsselbach and its hamlets celebrate their 1000th anniversary of their foundation.

The shrine site includes the Stone House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Queen of Heaven Orphanage Summer Camp; a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus designed by Maurice Loriaux; and a convent of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the order founded by Mother Cabrini. History Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini found the property, which had two barns and a springhouse but no reliable source of water, on the side of Lookout Mountain in 1902. She negotiated the purchase of the property in 1910 to use as a summer camp for Queen of Heaven Orphanage. A small farming operation was established and operated by Sisters of the Sacred Heart and during the summer, the camp hosted groups of girls from the orphanage to enjoy the outdoors and complete tasks on the farm. Water was hauled up to the camp from the stream in Mount Vernon Canyon until 1912, when Mother Cabrini discovered a spring on the property. A replica of the grotto of Lourdes was built over the spring in 1929, then demolished and replaced by the current sandstone grotto in 1959. The Stone House, designed as a dormitory for the summer camp, began construction in 1912 and was completed in 1914. The property became a pilgrimage site in 1938 following Mother Cabrini's beatification. The property was officially established as a shrine in 1946, the year she was canonized. In 1954, a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, designed by Maurice Loriaux and mounted on an base, was erected at the highest point of the site. A 373-step stairway was placed for pilgrims to climb, following Mother Cabrini's path up the mountain, marked with the Stations of the Cross. The Stone House in 2014. The summer camp closed in 1967 and the Stone House was used as a temporary convent until a permanent building was completed in 1970. Today, the convent contains a chapel, meeting rooms, gift shop, housing for the resident Sisters, and overnight accommodations for visitors. The statues and stained-glass windows of the chapel came from Villa Cabrini Academy in Burbank, California, a former school founded by the Missionary Sisters.\\"History of Mother Cabrini Shrine\\", Mother Cabrini Shrine, Golden, Colorado.

A member of the progressive political and 1870s literary movement in Portugal, Enes's life is notable for his achievements in several fields; by the time of his death he had worked across three continents as a journalist, dramatist, librarian, government minister, colonial administrator and diplomat. Enes wrote a controversial anti-clerical drama, \\"Os Lazaristas\\", and defended in 1870 the concept of a 'United States of Europe', fearing that Portugal would be absorbed by Spain. As a writer, politician, and later as High Commissioner in Portuguese Mozambique, Enes was a defender of Portugal's colonial possessions in Africa in the face of twin threats from an expansionist and aggressive British Empire and native uprisings. The town of Angoche in Mozambique was in the colonial era renamed 'António Enes' after him: the name of the town reverted to Angoche in 1976 following Portuguese decolonisation. Early life António Enes was born, the son of a clerk, in modest surroundings on the third floor of a house in Lisbon. He was a sickly child and health problems were to continue throughout his life. He studied at a Lazarist college in Santo Antão before attending the Liceu Nacional in Lisbon, completing his studies with a thesis in the Faculty of Letters on the Religious Philosophy of Egypt. As a student Enes became allied with the \\"generation of the 70s\\" – the name given to a movement dedicated to political liberalism and realism in art – other prominent members included Eça de Queiroz, Antero de Quental, Batalha Reis and Oliveira Martins. This political and literary affiliation shaped the rest of his career. Following initially a career in commerce, Enes found that the tranquil life of an office-worker did not suit him and he moved into journalism at the end of the 1860s, beginning his career as a literary critic on the 'Jornal do Comercio.'Monteiro, VC (2006), \\"A Querela Anticlerical no Palco e na Imprensa: Os Lazaristas\\" (Dissertation submitted to the Postgraduate programme of the Institute of Language Studies, Unviversity of Campinas) The journalist and young politician Enes became allied with the liberal, republican mood alive in Portugal in the 1870s. He joined the Historical Party, which, in 1876 was to become the Progressive Party. This resulted in his collaboration in journals where he could express and defend his political ideas. He was part of the editorial team for the Gazeta do Povo and shortly afterwards nominated director of O Páis, which became the official organ of the Progressive Party, changing its name to O Progresso. In 1870 in his book, \\"A Guerra e a Democracia\\", Enes argued that the old model of the European state was obsolete and advocated federalism as the only future for the continent. He suggested that a pan-Latin federal state (made up of Belgium, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal) would confront similar pan-Germanic and pan-Slavic entities. In 1880 he was elected a Deputy, but parliament was dissolved. He was re-elected in 1884, serving successive terms from 1884–87, 1887–89 and 1890-91. The dramatist Building on his contacts made in journalism, between 1875 and 1883, Enes became a dramatist. He wrote eight plays in the realist style: seven dramas and one comedy. The first of these, Os Lazaristas (1875), became notorious in Portugal and Brazil for its strongly anti-clerical message. The play centres on Bergeret, a French Lazarist priest in pursuit of riches. By preaching a corrupt and merciless version of the catholic doctrine Bergeret persuades Luísa, a young heiress, to devote herself to life in a nunnery and her fortune to the church. The play contracts reactionary ultramontanism - represented by Bergeret - with progressive liberalism, represented by Ernesto, a young revolutionary who would be Luisa's husband. Enes's enthusiasm for the theatre was not limited just to writing: he was a spectator and regular visitor backstage. It was in this way that he met the actress Emília dos Anjos, whom he married and with whom he had one daughter, Luísa. The Government Minister and Colonial Administrator Immediately after the British Ultimatum of 1890, António Enes was nominated Minister of the Navy and Overseas (he served from 14 October 1890 to 25 May 1891) in the government of General João Crisóstomo de Abreu e Sousa. It was a time of intense political tension as a wave of nationalism swept Portugal following the British ultimatum. António Enes was able to maintain the necessary internal and external balances. In particular, he organised a military expedition to Portuguese Mozambique, with the objective of breaking the increasing political proximity of Gungunhana and the British. He also intervened energetically in the colonies of Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese Guinea and Bié. Enes was succeeded as minister by Júlio de Vilhena and in 1891 he was nominated High Commissioner in Mozambique, where he left his name connected with notable works including organising the expedition of Joaquim Augusto Mouzinho de Albuquerque against the Empire of Gaza. Enes wrote a book about the war against Gaza, A guerra de Africa em 1895: Memórias. Brazil and final return to Portugal In 1896 Enes was chosen to act as Minister of Portugal in Brazil and he moved to Rio de Janeiro. The objective was to rebuild friendly relationships between the two countries, which had been badly shaken by the declaration of the Brazilian republic in 1889. Enes did not enjoy this role and he repeatedly asked to be relieved of the post, which occurred only in May 1900. On his return to Portugal, Enes once again took up journalism, founding \\"O Dia\\" and writing about politics. A few months later, with serious respiratory problems, he moved for the last time to Queluz where he died on 6 August 1901 shortly before his 53rd birthday.

Village Historically part of Cumberland, the village lies between the Lake District lakes of Loweswater and Crummock Water, about south of Cockermouth and within the Lake District National Park. It is overlooked by the peak of Mellbreak. The village church, dedicated to St Bartholomew, was built in 1827, and restored in 1884, although there has been a place of worship in the village since the early 12th century. Near to the church is the popular Kirkstile Inn. Civil parish The civil parish of Loweswater covers a considerable area around the village, and is bordered on its eastern side by the western shore of Crummock Water and by the River Cocker. To the north- west, the parish boundary is delineated by the summit of Fellbarrow, before encircling Loweswater lake via Low Fell and the A5086 road. From here, the parish boundary includes a large area of fell to the north and east of the summits of Blake Fell, Gavel Fell, Great Borne, Starling Dodd and Red Pike, before descending to Crummock Water. Besides the village of Loweswater itself, the parish also includes the settlement of Mockerkin, to the west of Loweswater lake. Most of the parish lies within the Lake District National Park, but a small part at its western end, including Mockerkin, is outside the National Park. At the time of the 2001 census the parish had a population of 209 living in 92 households. For local government purposes the civil parish forms part of the district of Allerdale within the county of Cumbria.

In general trustees are under a duty to act jointly and have authority to act individually only if the trust instrument so provides. In principle therefore each trustee has an equal say in the management of the trust property and therefore in the event of a breach the trustees are jointly and severally liable for their actions. However, trustees are only liable for their own breach and so a unilateral action by one trustee that constitutes a breach of trust will not engage the liability of another trustee's. Equitable principles still thought to survive In no situations where joint and several liability is engaged contribution claims between parties are governed by the operation of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978, but, in addition there remain several equitable principles developed by the chancery division of the English Courts that are thought to remain in effect. Such principles are likely to influence the court in their interpretation of the 1978 Act. Solicitor Trustees In Head v Gould[1898] 2 Ch 250; 67 LJ Ch 480; 78 Lt 739 was a case in English trust law concerning the indemnity of trustees inter se for a breach of a trust. Where a trustee has committed a breach of trust relying on the professional advice of a fellow solicitor trustee they were entitled to be indemnified by virtue of that reliance . It is one of the few common law situations concerning inter-trustee indemnity that is still thought to apply following the passing of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978. The rise of professional trustee companies has led to the suggestion that it may become of significant case law in the future. = Facts = Miss Head and Mrs. Gould were appointed trustees of certain marriage settlements, Mrs. Gould was a \\"Solicitor-Trustee\\". The trustees sold the house that was part of the trust property and in breach of trust paid the proceeds of the sale to a life tenant. On the other hand, Miss Head sought to claim that she was indemnified because of the status of her co-trustee as a solicitor. Miss Head claimed that she had acted in reliance on the professional advice of Gould. Upon investigation, there was no evidence that that was the cause and so Miss Head's claim to indemnity her husband was declined. However; in giving judgment by J. Kekewich, it was considered earlier an equitable case law and also considered that \\"I do not myself think that Bryne Jacob or any other judges ever intended to hold that a man is bound to indemnify himself of his co-trustees against loss merely because he was a solicitor, when that co- trustee was an active participant in the breach of trust complained of, and is not proved to have participated merely in consequence of the advice and control of the solicitor.\\"Please refer to : Head v. Gould [1898] 2 Ch. 250, from the Royal Common-Wealth Archives. Digitized on Monday, 23rd, 2045AR. Sole Benefit In Bahin v Hughes(1886) 31 Ch D 390 the situation where a sole trustee benefited from the breach of trust was considered by High Court. In that case there were two trustees, one of whom was passive in the management of the trust, one of those trustees acted honestly but in breach of the trust terms in making an investment. The passive trustee was unsuccessful in claiming an indemnity on the basis that it had been the actions of the other trustee that had caused the breach of trust. Cotton LJ felt that it would be wrong to punish a trustee who had acted honestly more than a trustee who had failed to act at all. However, it is not clear exactly how far this principle can be extended and it is generally thought that Bahin v Huges should be treated with caution .

Four SOE agents and instructors—Thor Helliessen, Jan Allan, Ruben Langmo and Johannes S. Andersen—were sent to Norway and parachuted into Nordmarka north of Oslo in October 1942. Their primary mission was to help the resistance movement Milorg with the assassinations of Norwegian Nazis and informers by training selected Milorg personnel for the task. If asked by Milorg they would also help as executioners. According to Chief of Defence, General Wilhelm von Tangen Hansteen, the group should only act upon decisions by the Home Forces, and they brought no liquidation lists from the UK.Moland (1999): pp. 60–64 The problem was that the operation had not been approved by Milorg in advance. In a meeting between Milorg leaders Jens Christian Hauge and Arthur Hansson and the expedition leader, it turned out that Bittern operated with a list of persons that SOE wanted to get rid of. The list contained 62 names, which not only included informers and torturers, but also Nazi politicians such as the government \\"ministers\\" Hagelin, Lie and Fuglesang. Milorg feared that the reprisals might be terribly harsh compared with the benefits of such assassinations, based on recent experience from Telavåg and Majavatn. It was decided that the agents should be used as instructors for military training and hand-to-hand combat, and the four persons were split into two teams. While one team solved its tasks satisfactorily, the other team's behaviour led to a scandal. After episodes of heavy drinking, too much talking, and other hazardous behaviour, Milorg demanded the two SOE agents to be recalled to the United Kingdom. Operation Bittern was severely criticized by the Norwegian Home Forces in letters and other communications to the Norwegian government-in-exile in London. The government in London was distinctly unimpressed that SOE, with the tacit acceptance of Norwegian High Command, had selected a former notorious criminal to take part in such a task. The incidents led to a long-lasting conflict between Milorg, the government-in-exile and SOE, although eventually a more cooperative climate developed between them.Gjelsvik (1977): pp. 99-100 References Category:1942 in Norway Category:Special Operations Executive operations Category:Military history of Norway during World War II Category:Norwegian resistance movement ","title":"Operation Bittern"},{"id":"25841813","text":"Shaukat Thanvi (2 February 1904 - 4 May1963) was a Pakistani journalist, essayist, columnist, novelist, short story writer, broadcaster, playwright, humorist and poet.Shaukat Thanvi's book Sees Mahal. Retrieved 2 May 2020 Early life Shaukat Thanvi was born in Bandraban, Mathura district, Uttar Pradesh, British India, on 2 February 1904. Thana Bhawan, a small town in Muzaffarnagar district (now in Shamli district) of Uttar Pradesh, was Thanvi's ancestral hometown and possibly the source of his last name, though Professor Mushtaq Azmi suggests that he adopted the name Thanvi because of his affection for the Islamic scholar Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi. Career Shaukat Thanvi had little formal schooling. Starting in 1928, he started working for an Urdu- language newspaper Hamdam from Lucknow, British India and continued working for several other Urdu newspapers. Then he joined the radio station in Lucknow as a writer and a broadcaster after it was first established in 1938. He was doing mainly humorous talk shows at the radio station. At the suggestion of Syed Imtiyaz Ali Taj, Thanvi joined Lahore's Pancholi Art Pictures as a story and songwriter in 1943. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Pancholi Art Pictures closed down and Shaukat Thanvi joined Radio Pakistan in Lahore. In 1957, Shaukat Thanvi joined the Daily Jang newspaper and started writing a humor column in it called \\"Vaghaira Vaghaira\\", which later became very popular among the Pakistani public. Marriage He was not married to the Pakistani television actress Arsh Muneer, contrary to popular belief. However, he was married twice, to Saeeda Khatoon and Zohra Begum. Literary works Thanvi was a prolific writer and penned some sixty books, which include collections of short stories and humorous essays, plays and novels. He was also a poet; a collection of his poetry called Guharistan was published early in his career.

It was named “Novopodolsky” and on December 30 of the same year was tagged with an official number – 711. By the late 1930s, the Novopodolskiy plant had mastered the full production cycle of the cartridges most needed in the army: rifle (7.62×54mmR) and pistol (7.62×25mm) ammunition. By 1941, the plant had started producing pyrotechnical compounds and, to add to that, six more types of cartridges of calibers 7.62 mm and 12.7 mm. Among those listed were the munitions used for feeding renowned Mosin–Nagant rifles, TT pistols, Nagant revolvers and DShK heavy machine-guns, among others. Besides, in 1943 a scientific research institute for cartridge design (NII-44) was established on the base of the plant. In the war years, despite the wartime hardships and following a great increase in both new and existing firearms production, the facility output increased nineteenfold. For its achievements during the war, the plant staff was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st Degree. In 1960 the plant was renamed “Klimovsk Stamping Plant” (KSP). In the same period, 1950–60's, experimental automated manufacture of then-standard intermediate cartridges in 7.62×39mm was launched at the plant. 7.62×39mm rounds are the ammunition for the famed AK-47 series of assault rifles. They are still widely used today, both for old military designs and new professional and amateur hunting rifles, which is reflected in factory's production. In 2000, the cartridges with nickel-plated casing were presented at the international weapon exhibition IWA & OutdoorClassics in Nuremberg, Germany, followed by an export contract. Later on, the plant proceeded with producing six modifications of 7.62×39mm cartridges with bimetallic case. About the same time, sport pistol cartridges of KSP brand appear: 9 × 19 “Parabellum” and 9 × 18 “Makarov”; hunting rifle cartridges caliber 5.56 “Magnum”, 5.56×45mm of .223 Remington type, 7.62 × 51 of .308 Winchester type; a 1943 submachine gun cartridge with a bullet of increased penetration power. These cartridges aroused vivid interest with foreign customers. A closed-type joint stock company (ZAO), Klimovsk Specialized Ammunition Plant, was founded in 2001 on the base of OAO KSP. Following the new trend of traumatic (which means non-lethal, rubber-bullet, obstructed-barrel) handguns being widely marketed in Russia with notable success, the factory began producing traumatic cartridges to keep up with the demand.

It is a subdivision of Brazilian Romanticism, being thus called \\"the third phase of Brazilian Romanticism\\", preceded by the Indianism and the Ultra-Romanticism. Condorism was created by the poet Tobias Barreto, who was one of its most significant figures alongside Castro Alves and Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa. The name \\"Condorism\\" comes from the condor, a bird of solitary and high flight, said to be capable of seeing things from a great distance. Condorist poets believed they had this same ability, and should use it to educate people in the ways of justice and freedom. Sometimes (albeit very rarely) Condorism is also called Hugoanism (in ), after Victor Hugo, who served as the major Condorist influence. Characteristics Condorism changed Brazilian poetry in a variety of ways, being considered the Romantic phase that preceded the Realism in Brazil. Condorist poetry is characterized by a heavy use of hyperboles and grandiose language. Its main themes are Abolitionism and Republicanism, although the lyrical genre is also cultivated. However, unlike in the \\"Ultra-Romanticism\\", where love is heavily idealized and platonic, in Condorist poetry it is corporified, concrete, viable.

A center, he played college basketball for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Kentucky Wildcats from 1949 to 1951. After his high school career, Spivey was recruited by the University of Kentucky. During his time with the Wildcats, he led the team to the 1951 NCAA Tournament championship, and was voted Most Outstanding Player of the event. When a point shaving scandal was revealed that year, Spivey was accused of being involved, which he denied. He left the Wildcats in December 1951, and the university banned him from the squad in March 1952. After he testified before a grand jury in New York, he was indicted on perjury charges. Although Spivey was not convicted when the case went to trial in 1953, he was prevented from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years. Early life William Edwin Spivey was born in Lakeland, Florida, and had moved to Columbus, Georgia, by 1944, at which time he was . After taking up basketball, he played for his high school's team and had 18 points in his first half of game action. The following year, he moved to Warner Robins, Georgia, which did not have a basketball team before he arrived. The principal of Warner Robins' high school created a team, however, once Spivey came. During one of his high school seasons, he was forced to play without shoes—since none of the school's shoes fit him—and wear three pairs of socks.Trease, p. 41. Spivey had over 1,800 points in his three-year high school career. College career=Recruitment Several universities wanted to give Spivey a basketball scholarship in 1948. The University of Kentucky first became aware of Spivey when a Georgia newspaper publisher phoned Fred Wachs, whom writer Earl Cox called \\"the most powerful man in Lexington\\"; according to Cox, Wachs \\"ran the University of Kentucky\\". After hearing of Spivey from the publisher, who indicated a desire to have him attend the university, Wachs notified Kentucky's men's basketball coach, Adolph Rupp, who elected to have a scout watch Spivey play. Following positive feedback from the scout, Rupp gave Spivey an invitation to a camp held at Alumni Gymnasium, where he would try out against other leading high school seniors. He received a scholarship on the camp's first day, one of two players to do so. 1948–49 to 1949–50 Even though he offered a scholarship to the seven-foot Spivey, Rupp was concerned about his weight, which was between 160 and 165 pounds. Rupp told him that he would play only if he added , and Spivey bulked up to during the summer of 1948. At the time, first-year players were not allowed to compete on varsity teams. Therefore, Spivey spent his first year at Kentucky on a freshman team, while the varsity team won its second consecutive NCAA Basketball Championship in 1949. The two teams practiced against each other, and varsity team member Ralph Beard later said that Spivey outplayed the Wildcats' All-American center, Alex Groza. The U.S. Olympic team, which had six Wildcats players on it, practiced in Lexington, and Spivey gained knowledge and skills from team members Groza, Vince Boryla and Bob Kurland. Spivey also competed in games against other freshman teams, including one against Xavier in which he posted 31 points. In 15 games, he averaged about 20 points per game. In the 1949–50 season, the Wildcats lost several of the leading players from their championship-winning teams to graduation, including Beard and Groza. In response, Rupp made Spivey the focal point of the team, and the team exceeded expectations. In a February 18, 1950 game against Georgia Tech, which the Wildcats won 97–62, Spivey broke the team record for points in a game with 40, two more than Groza scored in a game the previous season. That record has since been broken, but his 42 field goal attempts remain a school record as of 2017.Kentucky 2017–18 Men's Basketball Media Guide, pp. 160, 171. Spivey tied another of Groza's point-scoring records on March 5 with a 37-point performance in a Southeastern Conference (SEC) Men's Basketball Tournament game. Kentucky won over Tennessee 95–58 to win the SEC Tournament for the seventh consecutive season. Kentucky ended the regular season with a 25–4 record, and Spivey averaged 19.4 points a game. Despite the Wildcats' record and SEC title, the NCAA Tournament selection committee did not give the team a berth in the 1950 tournament. Kentucky did gain a berth to the National Invitation Tournament, but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by City College of New York (CCNY), 89–50. In that game, Spivey was forced to the bench for the final nine minutes of the first half after accumulating four personal fouls. At the end of the season, Spivey was named to the All-SEC team,Doyel, p. 61. and the Associated Press selected him for its 1950 All-American third team. 1950–51 Kentucky played a much- anticipated game versus Kansas on December 16, 1950, with Spivey matched up against Jayhawks center Clyde Lovellette. The Wildcats won by 29 points as Spivey outplayed Lovellette, in what he later called the best performance of his college career. After one steal, he drove to the Kansas basket and did a slam dunk; this was rare for Kentucky basketball at the time, as Rupp instructed players not to dunk during games.Nelli and Nelli, p. 68. Spivey set another school record in a February 13, 1951, game, gathering 34 rebounds. As of 2017, he remains tied for the team record with Bob Burrow, who had the same number of rebounds in a 1955 game.Kentucky 2017–18 Men's Basketball Media Guide, p. 177. For the season, Spivey again averaged more than 19 points per game,Trease, pp. 41–43. and he added 17.2 rebounds per game. His point total led the SEC, and his 479 regular season points were the third-most in league history at the time. The Wildcats had a 28–2 record during the regular season, and entered the postseason as the top-ranked team in the country. One of those losses came in the SEC Tournament against Vanderbilt, but it did not affect the team's prospects for an NCAA Tournament berth because the SEC had decided to send its regular season champion to the newly expanded 16-team tournament. Kentucky advanced to the Tournament's Final Four, where Spivey had 28 points and 16 rebounds in a 76–74 win over Illinois. The Wildcats then faced Kansas State in the NCAA championship game. Despite falling behind early in the contest, they took the lead in the second half and pulled away to win 68–58. Spivey played an important role in the victory, scoring 22 points and pulling down 21 rebounds. Rupp said after the game that \\"Spivey made the difference after he went to work.\\" For his performance in the Final Four, Spivey was named the event's Most Outstanding Player. He was later selected to the 1951 All-American team, as well as the All-SEC team for the second straight season. Implication in gambling scandal The CCNY point shaving scandal was revealed in 1951. A series of college basketball players had conspired with gamblers to shave points to ensure that their teams lost against the point spread. According to Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan, 32 players were involved in point shaving or match fixing, and 86 games were affected. That figure included three ex-Kentucky players: Dale Barnstable, Beard, and Groza, who engaged in point shaving during a 1949 National Invitation Tournament game. Having been sidelined in the early part of the 1951–52 season after knee surgery, Spivey gave up his eligibility to play for the Wildcats on December 24, 1951. He denied rumors that he was involved in the scandal, calling them \\"false and malicious\\". Spivey intended to return to the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. He was the only implicated player to deny allegations of point shaving. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions. Trial On June 9, Spivey was arrested in New York, and was released pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment for his role in shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. John Y. Brown Sr., the attorney representing Spivey, argued that Hirsch and Line had lied to gamblers in claiming that they had given Spivey a share of the point shaving proceeds. The trial lasted for 13 days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey. Professional career Although Spivey was not found guilty in the scandal, he found himself blackballed from the NBA after league president Maurice Podoloff banned all 32 players involved in the CCNY scandal for life.Doyel, p. 62.Porter, p. 379. The Cincinnati Royals later tried to sign Spivey, but Podoloff refused to approve the contract. Spivey filed a lawsuit against the NBA and Podoloff in 1960, seeking more than $800,000 in damages. Afterward, he claimed that his rights under the Sherman Antitrust Act had been violated and sued the league in federal court, dropping his initial case. In response, Podoloff offered to settle with Spivey for $10,000, which he accepted. According to sportswriter Jim Murray, Spivey felt that he had no choice but to accept because the court schedule was so full that even if he had won his case, he would have been too old to be a viable NBA prospect in any case. Future Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall said that \\"most people feel [Spivey] would have been one of the top five centers of all-time had he had the chance to mature in the NBA.\\"Doyel, p. 63. Instead, Spivey spent his professional career playing for numerous minor league and barnstorming teams. In October 1952, Spivey played in two games for the American Basketball League's Elmira Colonels, scoring 21 and 32 points in the contests. That season, he also was a member of the Detroit Vagabonds barnstorming team. For the next three seasons, he spent time with three teams connected to the Harlem Globetrotters exhibition team: the Boston Whirlwinds, the House of David, and the Washington Generals. In one game with the Whirlwinds, Spivey got into a fight with Globetrotters player Bobby \\"Showboat\\" Hall. For the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons, Spivey played for another barnstorming team, the New York Olympians, later renamed the Kentucky Colonels. Beginning with the 1957–58 season, Spivey spent 10 of his remaining 12 professional seasons in the EBL. The first two of those EBL seasons were spent with the Wilkes-Barre Barons, and Spivey led the team to consecutive league championships. On April 20, 1958, he scored 62 points in the title-clinching game against the Easton Madisons, setting an EBL playoff record. In 1958–59, he became the first player in league history with a 1,000-point season, and had 64 points in a March 1959 game. That season, he was named the league's most valuable player. Along with his play in the EBL, Spivey reached an agreement to join the Ansonia Norwoods of the semi-professional Connecticut Basketball Association (CBA) in 1958. Over two years with the Norwoods, his points-per-game average exceeded 30.0. Spivey moved to the Baltimore Bullets for the 1959–60 season, and played two seasons for the club. In Spivey's first season with the Bullets, he had 36.3 points per game, the highest average of his EBL career. Outside EBL competition, he received an opportunity to play opposite leading NBA center Wilt Chamberlain in a 1960 exhibition game, held in Milford, Connecticut, against the CBA's Milford Chiefs. Spivey had a 30-point, 23-rebound performance; his statistics were comparable to those of Chamberlain, who recorded a 31-point, 27-rebound game. The Bullets won the league championship in 1960–61, after which Spivey played two seasons in a different American Basketball League, with the Los Angeles Jets and Long Beach–Hawaii Chiefs. Spivey was named to the 1961–62 All-ABL Second Team after averaging 22.7 points per game and 11.2 rebounds per game with the Chiefs; his total of 1,773 points was second behind Connie Hawkins. In the 1962–63 season, which was shortened when the league suspended operations, he had an average of 22.5 points per game in 24 games with Long Beach. In ABL history, Spivey was third in points scored and fourth in rebounds. Spivey returned to the EBL in 1963 to join the Scranton Miners, for whom he played five seasons. His highest scoring average for the Miners came in the 1964–65 season, when he had 27.0 points per game. In 1967–68, his final professional season, Spivey went back to the Barons. Playing for about $200 in salary per contest, he had 10.4 points per game. On February 11, 1968, Spivey participated in his final professional game. Taking advantage of a loophole in the NBA's rules, he took part in an all-star game in Baltimore featuring former Baltimore Bullets players before a Bullets – San Diego Rockets game. Spivey led both teams by scoring 12 points, but his team lost by one point. One day later he retired, saying \\"It really meant something for me to finish off my career with a game like that.\\" By the end of his career, Spivey's physical condition had declined; Lou Tsioropoulos, who had played with him at Kentucky, said, \\"He was just completely disabled. He could barely walk.\\" Later life A jersey honoring Spivey hangs in Rupp Arena. After retiring from basketball, Spivey became a businessman, and moved back to Kentucky. The majority of his jobs involved sales; these included the selling of building materials and insurance. He also helped to develop real estate and owned restaurants, including a Lexington-based eatery, Bill Spivey's Restaurant and Lounge.Porter, p. 447. For a time he was the state's deputy insurance commissioner. Spivey ran in the primary election for Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1983 as a Democrat, but came in last in the seven-person race. Spivey made his final public appearance in 1991, at a reunion of the 1951 Kentucky Wildcats team in Lexington. Writer Greg Doyel says that \\"he was a recluse\\" at the time.Doyel, pp. 63–64. According to his wife, Audrey Spivey, \\"He never got over [his accusation in the 1951 college basketball scandal]. Bill could not let that go. He was just devastated.\\" Then living in Daytona Beach, Florida, he was later hurt in an automobile accident, which aggravated a lower-back injury. Spivey's son, Cashton, said that \\"He never made a full recovery from that. It affected his posture, and he had chronic pain from that.\\"Doyel, p. 64. In a post-accident bone grafting operation, a piece of equipment became lodged in Spivey's lower back; according to Cashton, he won a small amount from the hospital in a lawsuit. Spivey moved to Quepos, Costa Rica, around 1993, after vacationing there with a friend six months before. Audrey did not come with him, although the couple did not separate legally. On May 8, 1995, he was found dead of natural causes at the age of 66. Spivey received two notable honors posthumously: his jersey number, 77, was retired by the University of Kentucky in January 2000, and the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame inducted him in September 2004.Doyel, p. 65.

With its vaulted ceilings, ornate mantelpieces, and red carpet, the Grand Hotel was a plush and social rendezvous from its opening. The Grand Hotel reopened in 1967/8 as the 'Grand Building' fitted out as offices. The leading hotels of Auckland were in the following order: The Grand Hotel, Princes St (closed 1966), the Central Hotel, Victoria St (closed 1972), the Star Hotel, Albert St (closed 1973), the Royal Hotel, Elliot St (closed 1980s) and the Albert Hotel, Queen St. Consequently, the Grand Hotel facade is the last surviving of the main Victorian/Edwardian era hotels in Auckland. \\"The Grand Hotel fairly shouts Victoriana from the ornate facade and wrought iron balconies to the marble statuary and plush gloominess of its interior. The manager of the Grand Hotel, Mr S T Johnson, has been there only 16 months although he frequently worked on relief for previous managers. Both he and his wife feel closely identified with the hotel and enjoy its atmosphere and old world tranquillity. \\"Lord Denning stayed here recently and he was delighted,\\" said Mr Johnson, \\"He said it reminded him of home.\\" - New Zealand Herald 21 May 1966 The Grand Hotel architect was Mr William Skinner, designed in 1887, costing no more than £3000. The Grand Hotel was owned through Hancock and Company Limited by Moss Davis and later by his sons Sir Ernest Davis and Eliot Davis. The hotel was opened by 1889, however, the interior of the third storey was fitted out at a slightly later date around 1890/91. The Grand replaced the earlier Masonic Hotel that was owned by the Ara Masonic Lodge. Additions to the rear of the Grand on Bankside St took place in 1900 by architect John Currie. In 1902 the hotel was rebuilt after the fire, incorporating the front and side facades that had survived. In 1913, a large extension to the Grand Hotel was completed which included a new dining room, kitchen, scullery, and open-cage lift. This was the last major addition to the hotel. Grand Hotel Facade, March 2010. Built 1889. Opening The Grand Hotel was opened on 21 April 1889 by Mr Frank Gaudin for the purpose of receiving the Earl and Countess of Onslow on their arrival from Britain. Bankside Cottage, Bankside Street, Central Auckland. Built in the 1880s, the cottage was bought by Hancock & Co. Ltd, brewers, in the mid-1930s. Hancocks were the proprietors of the Grand Hotel next door, facing Princes Street. From the 1930s the cottage was used to accommodate Grand Hotel staff. It was restored when the Grand Hotel was demolished and incorporated into the new development. 1901 fire and reconstruction In 1901 the Grand Hotel hit the headlines with a massive fire. At the time of the fire the hotel had just finished being refurbished in anticipation of hosting the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall during their stay in Auckland as part of the 1901 Royal Tour. The fire almost destroyed the building and killed three children, a bank manager from Wellington and a maid. The cost of the damage was said to be £12,000 and the fire left only the charred external and interior brick walls. The lack of fire escapes became a public concern. The children Leonora, Eva and Nina Johnston died of smoke inhalation, the hotel employee, Dora Wallace died after jumping from the building. The fire was not the end for the Grand Hotel and it was soon rebuilt, incorporating the original ornate plastered brick street frontage and side walls. The interior was furnished by large paintings collected by Moss Davis and Ernest Hyam Davis which leased the Grand Hotel building from the Ara Masonic Lodge through Hancock & Co. Ltd. These paintings were auctioned when the hotel closed on the 14th December 1966 and are in private collections, many having returned to the United Kingdom.

Guests Well known guests over the years include: Queen Elizabeth II, Randolph Churchill, Noël Coward, Captain Musick, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, George Formby, Todd Duncan, Webster Booth, Mountbattens, Lord Montgomery, Gracie Fields, Anthony Eden, Duke of Edinburgh, Lord Denning, Dame Margot Fonteyn, Jean Batten, innumerable prime ministers and governors-general. Closure \\"One of the finest and most up-to-date establishments in Auckland\\". \\"Outmoded and old fashioned and does not pay its way\\". These two comments have an ironic ring and to a degree sum up the rise and fall of the Grand Hotel. In 1966 the Grand Hotel was to be closed. After 77 years of service the Grand Hotel began shutting up shop. The last guests left and only a skeleton staff remained to clean up and staff the bars. A party was held for the staff in the dining room. The star of the occasion was the Chef Mr Lesley Horace Rose who had been chef at the hotel since 1937. \\"It is a tragedy\\", said Mr Rose referring to the closing of the Grand Hotel. \\"The Grand Hotel was the last frontier of the true hotel\\". \\"I think I have been chef at this hotel longer than any chef at any other Auckland hotel\\", he said, \\"and I have enjoyed every moment\\". Other staff members were recorded to have been very wistful. Mr Rose stated that it was remarkable that so many had stayed when they knew the hotel was closing down. \\"It is very sad for me\\", he said. \\"The hotel was a tradition in Auckland.\\" A few weeks later the bar closed \\"quietly and sedately, as befits the grand old lady of Princes Street\\" and the building was converted into offices. On 14 December 1966 the hotel contents were auctioned in the hotel which included the paintings, chandeliers, mirrors, chairs and other interior fittings. Other furniture was removed by private collectors and dealers after the main auction sale. Grand Building Grand Building, October 1974 As an office building it was renamed \\"Grand Building\\". A notable tenant was the Chartered Accountancy firm, Buddle & Co, whose board room on the first floor and a balcony were part of the Royal Suite used by dignitaries, including Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1979 the Grand Hotel was controversially reduced from a completely protected building to just its front facade. Demolition In 1987 the Auckland City Council approved the development of a 15-floor office tower on the site. It was to include the facades of the Grand Hotel and the neighbouring 1881 Freemasons Hall. Demolition began and in 1988 and before long nothing was left of the old hotel other than the bare facade, incorporated into the glass tower which is now the headquarters of dairy company Fonterra. Conversion In 2016 it was announced that the facade of the Grand Hotel and Freemason's Hall will be preserved while the office tower behind will be converted into apartments, known as 'The International', as part of major refurbishments. Re- design of the project occurred with architects Jasmax and Marchese Partners, while structural strengthening and redesign was completed by Bonacci Group, now Meinhardt-Bonacci. Fletcher Building was appointed main contractors but pulled out after initial discussions, after which Dominion Constructors were awarded the project. The project is expected to be completed at the end of 2020, about 131 years after the Grand Hotel first opened in 1889.

Description From the nomination file: \\"The building is situated on the north side of Main Street at the eastern edge of the village's central business district. It is isolated from other buildings on Main Street by an alley on its west side and a large landscaped lot to the east at the corner of Fair Street.A cross Main Street, to the south, is the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The post office is set back from the street with mature foundation plantings at the front. On the west side is a parking lot and maneuvering area. The property slopes downward at the rear and along the. eastern side of the building. A retaining wall extends along the north side of the parking area. A stairway leading down from this wall provides access to the exposed basement at the rear of the post office. The building retains its integrity to a high degree on the exterior, although the interior has been altered. [...] \\" \\"Cooperstown Post Office is one story in height in the front and two stories in the rear where the basement is fully exposed. It is constructed on_a raised foundation of poured concrete and brick with facades clad in red brick laid in English bond. Rectangular in shape, it is five bays wide and six bays deep with an unadorned low parapet. A limestone watercourse and beltcourse and low hipped roof distinguish the main section from the rear or workroom section, which is more plainly decorated and has a flat roof. The principal facade is symmetrically composed with a three-bay pedimented central section faced entirely with ashlar limestone. Reminiscent of a Greek- temple, it consists of four square engaged pilasters with molded capitals supporting a plain frieze and shallow pediment. Wide stone steps flanked by Greek-inspired torchere lamps resting on stone wing walls lead to the central entry which contains modern doors. On either side of the entry are windows with eight- over-eight double-hung metal sash. The single bays which flank the central section contain similar windows, each with a limestone lintel and eight-over- eight double-hung sash above a stone panel. \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE COOPERSTOWN NEW YORK\\" is affixed in bronze letters above the entrance. The three-bay-wide east and west facades of the main section have similar window treatments. The rear section has windows with eight-over-eight sash and four- light transoms on the first floor and smaller windows with eight-over-eight sash on the basement level along the north and east sides.On the west side is a chimney and covered mailing platform.\\" \\"The public lobby of the post office building occupies the space behind four of the five bays of the main facade. The postmaster's office is located in the southeast corner of the lobby and the workroom occupies most of the remainder of the first floor. The lobby was completely altered in 1978 and 1981. Originally rectangular, it now features a wide, deep alcove in the center section which contains lock boxes. The ceiling has been dropped and the screenline changed. The only remnant of the original scheme is the paneled wood wainscotting and bulletin cases on the east wall. A cast-metal sculptural relief, once located over the postmaster's door, is now on the wall inside the vestibule.

It originally aired on January 24, 2010, on ABC. The episode was written by co- creator Steven Levitan and directed by Jason Winer. In the episode, Jay introduces Cameron to his friends as \\"a friend of Mitchell\\" instead of partner something that makes Mitchell mad and leads him to tell Jay that his friend Shorty is gay. Jay refuses to believe him but when Gloria also notices that to him, he starts to believe that they might be right. Claire has troubles using a universal remote for their home theater system and to prove Phil that it is not her fault but the remote is too complicated, she challenges Phil to teach Haley how to use it. In the meantime, Manny has a date with a girl he has been talking to for a while but never seen before. The episode achieved a Nielsen rating of 4.2/11, attracting 9.828 million viewers and received positive reviews from critics. Plot Jay (Ed O'Neill) and his buddies meet Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), whom Jay introduces as Mitchell's (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) friend. This incenses Mitchell, who tells Jay that Shorty (Chazz Palminteri) sets off his gaydar by the way he talks, dresses and acts. (To the camera, Mitchell and Cameron discuss Mitchell's coming out to his father and that Jay had a hard time accepting it). Jay refuses to believe it, but Gloria (Sofía Vergara) agrees with Mitchell when Jay informs her of his opinion. Jay begins noticing signs after he starts watching how Shorty acts and comes to think that it may be possible, but once he offers support to Shorty, he discovers that his friend is a bad gambler with smart dress habits. Meanwhile, Gloria gives Manny's (Rico Rodriguez) surprise date, Whitney (Kristen Schaal), a shabbily dressed young woman, a makeover so that she can feel better about herself. Cameron ends up meeting Manny's date, who thinks Cameron may be the guy for her after a short conversation. Jay confronts Mitchell, telling him that in offering his support to his friend Shorty, he has had to loan him $20,000 to cover gambling debts. Mitchell tells his father he is proud of him, for becoming more open-minded than he was when Mitchell was younger. Claire (Julie Bowen) has troubles working with Phil's (Ty Burrell) universal remote for their new home theater system because she thinks it is too complicated. Phil disagrees and to prove that it is not, he teaches Haley (Sarah Hyland) how to handle it after Claire decides that no one in their family can learn the remote except from Phil. Once Phil is asleep, Claire begs Haley to teach her how to use the remote because Phil talks to her like a child when he is doing so. The episode's title refers to Mitchell's concluding voice-over, explaining that people may change a little, perhaps fifteen percent, if they really want to do so. Production The episode was written by Steven Levitan who co-created the show and directed by Jason Winer. It is his third episode, written after the pilot and \\"The Incident\\". It was Jason Winer's ninth episode he directed the first being the pilot. The episode was both the thirteenth episode aired and broadcast. The episode featured a big list of guest stars including Chazz Palminteri as Shorty, Kristen Schaal as Whitney, Reid Ewing as Dylan, Darius Dudly as Dale, William Jones as Scotty and Bernardo Badillo as Delivery man. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Fifteen Percent\\" was viewed by 9.829 million viewers with an 18-49 rating of 4.2/11. The episode recovered from a sharp drop in both overall viewers and 18-49 ratings the previous week, and received the best rating since the pilot episode. The episode ranked 21st in the weekly ratings the highest ranking for Modern Family and became the third highest ranking show on ABC after The Bachelor and Grey's Anatomy. Also it ranked 9th in the weekly 18-49 ratings. Reviews \\"Fifteen Percent\\" got positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.9/10, the lowest review yet saying that \\"This was the set up for three storylines showing us just how much people can actually change. Two of those storylines were silly sitcom filler with just enough good jokes not to become dull.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad gave it a positive review saying that \\"As usual, there was a ton going on this week, with all three families dealing with different types of crises. Kristen Schaal (Flight of the Conchords) was in one of the more unusual guest roles I've seen . You can't really describe how she came to be on the episode without it sounding all kinds of creepy, and yet the show managed to avoid any of the cliche reactions to what happened.\\" and that \\"There's just something more authentic about all these relationships, and I think a lot of it is bucking expectations. Lesley Savage of Entertainment Weekly gave it a positive review saying that \\" Tonight’s overarching theme was about change – big and small. From guest star Kristen Schaal’s makeover to Jay’s slow acceptance of his friend’s supposed (but ultimately false) homosexuality, to Claire’s ability to handle technology and admit she can be wrong. But this being Modern Family, no one actually changed that much (and thank goodness for that, we love them all as they are) — just 15 percent.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it an A with readers giving it a B+ saying that \\"It can be a little easy to think that the Dunphy stuff isn't as interesting when it's in its own little bubble, particularly as so many of the stories boil down to the sort of \\"Husbands are dumb, and wives are smart!\\" stuff that so many sitcoms have already been built around. But I liked what \\"Fifteen Percent\\" did with this storyline, even as it delved into a fairly stereotypical storyline in and of itself. Claire doesn't know how to use the AV system in the living room? Y'don't say. Yet, at the same time, this is the kind of storyline that still rings true enough to life that it has some bite to it, and it also gives Phil one of the rare occasions when he's the smart one in the relationship, with Claire having to turn to him to figure out what's going on\\".

A maritime power is able to easily control their coast, and exert influence upon both nearby and far countries. A nation that dominates the world navally is known as a maritime superpower. Maritime power=Emerging Many countries that become maritime powers, become strong in order to defend themselves from an extant threat, such as the USSR did during the Cold War, in order to defend themselves from the United States Navy. In this scenario, it is common for the emerging maritime power to focus largely upon area denial tactics, rather than power projection. PossibleActual Maritime powers are often much more involved in global politics and trade. History Due to its status as an island nation which needed naval protection against continental European states, Britain's fleet of naval and trade ships were already several times larger than that of its closest rival before the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Britain was only able to maximise the economic advantage of the Industrial Revolution by using the same naval power to convince or force other countries to purchase their factory-manufactured goods.

Reception Danica Davidson finds Ayumi to be a very sympathetic character, as she regards his \\"insecurity\\" and drive to be \\"normal\\" as being \\"understandable to readers his age or anyone who’s ever been his age\\". Davidson felt that the serious treatment of Ayumu's family tragedy was incongruous with the broader comedy themes of the manga, and wondered in what tone the manga would continue. Ed Chavez feels that the theme of the manga is \\"learning about relationships\\" and feelings, and notes that they've \\"gone through a lot\\", particularly Ayumu, who is starting at a new school after a family tragedy. Ayumu feels responsible for the incident, and is making an effort \\"not to stand out\\" and to \\"just be a normal kid\\".Chavez feels that Takashi sees Ayumu's true personality under his \\"normal kid\\" facade, and decides that Ayumu is the perfect teammate for Takashi's dream of being part of the funniest comedy duo in Japan. Chavez did not find the main duo engaging enough to wish to continue reading the series, although he enjoyed the interactions of the whole cast. He feels the theme of The Manzai Comics is learning to grow up and have fun along the way and learning to hold on to your ambitions, classifying The Manzai Comics as seinen, but feels the manga would be more suitable for younger readers despite some swearing. Chavez places the theme of the manga within the context of a manzai boom of the 1980s, and a subsequent general increase of manzai on television and anime. He felt that the comedic twist on the staging of Romeo and Juliet was refreshing. Brigid Alverson was disappointed that there were no translator's notes explaining manzai. Chavez feels that later, the more complicated manzai humour is lost in translation, and that it is a difficult topic for a manga. Alverson did not find the comedy particularly funny, but felt the secondary characters were well-developed, especially enjoying the lampooning of \\"super-cute shoujo girl\\" characters via Meg.Alverson, Brigid (January 1, 2009) Review: The Manzai Comics, vol. 1 MangaBlog Retrieved January 24, 2010. Chavez also remarked on the character designs of the females, describing them as \\"moe\\", noting the illustrator's previous work for Gainax. Katherine Dacey felt that the manga \\"covered familiar ground, but yielded some funny moments nevertheless\\", feeling that the more \\"melodramatic\\" moments were not well-integrated with the rest of the manga, but that they added an extra dimension to the characters' friendship. Connie C. for PopCultureShock felt that the blending of genres was done well, and although she found the plot and characters \\"unremarkable\\", she felt that the manga was well-executed.

He is best known outside Sweden as the author of Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers, published by W. W. Norton in 1997 (). Life Gullberg grew up and was trained as a surgeon in Sweden. He qualified in medicine at the University of Lund in 1964. He practised as a surgeon in Saudi Arabia, Norway and Virginia Mason Hospital, Seattle in the United States, as well as in Sweden. Gullberg saw himself as a doctor rather than a writer. His first book, on science, won the Swedish Medical Society's Jubilee Prize in 1980, and saw him promoted to honorary doctor at the University of Lund the same year. He was twice married: first to Anne-Marie Hallin (d. 1983), with whom he had three children; and Ann, with whom he adopted two sons. He died of a stroke in Nordfjordeid, Norway at the hospital where he was working. Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers Gullberg's second (and last) book, Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers, took ten years to write, consuming all of his spare time. It proved a major success; its first edition of 17,000 copies was virtually sold out within six months. Contents The book's 1093 pages address the following topics: # Numbers and Language # Systems of Numeration # Types of Numbers # Cornerstones of Mathematics # Combinatorics # Symbolic Logic # Set Theory # Introduction to Sequences and Series # Theory of Equations # Introduction to Functions # Overture to the Geometries # Elementary Geometry # Trigonometry # Hyperbolic Functions # Analytic Geometry # Vector Analysis # Fractals # Matrices and Determinants # Embarking on Calculus # Introduction to Differential Calculus # Introduction to Integral Calculus # Power Series # Indeterminate Limits # Complex Numbers Revisited # Extrema and Critical Points # Arc Length # Centroids # Area # Volume # Motion # Harmonic Analysis # Methods of Approximation # Probability Theory # Differential Equations Reception Arnold Allen, reviewing Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers in The American Mathematical Monthly, wrote that although there were many worthy books that could claim the title of people's guide to mathematics, \\"Gullberg's book is clearly the overall winner. ... It is a wonderful read. I take it with me everywhere I go.\\" Allen says the book has \\"special charm\\", making innovative use of the margin and providing \\"excellent quotes and quips\\" throughout. His favourite chapter is \\"Cornerstones of Mathematics\\" which he believes should appeal both to beginners and \\"old hands\\". He professes himself amazed at Gullberg's revelation of an alternative pencil-and-paper method of multiplication from the one we all learned at school, namely the Egyptian method of duplation, and loves the \\"Russian peasant\\" multiplication method involving \\"successive duplation and mediation\\". He admires the \\"efficient\\" Babylonian method of finding square roots, using division and averaging. He learns from Gullberg how to multiply and divide using an abacus. The seven bridges of Königsberg Allen is delighted by the chapter on combinatorics, with its approach to graph theory and magic squares, complete with 1740 map of the seven bridges of Königsberg (which have to be traversed exactly once). He enjoys Gullberg's account of the Fibonacci, Lucas and Pell sequences; and he finds the two-page account of Fermat's last theorem \\"at exactly the right level for those who are mathematically disadvantaged, but with some sophistication as well.\\" He loved the chapter on probability. He claims that after he showed colleagues the book, he had to keep it hidden to prevent it from disappearing, and suggests that every high school maths teacher should be given a copy to improve maths teaching across America. He records that he finds its introductory accounts useful for engineers who use maths only occasionally, and suggests how the book could be used for undergraduate students. He concludes by describing the book as \\"gigantic ... in every sense\\" (it weighs 4 pounds 13 ounces, is 1100 pages long) and was 10 years in the making, and calls it \\"a giant leap forward for mathematics and all those who love it!\\". The book was positively reviewed in Scientific American, but more reservedly in New Scientist. Kevin Kelly comments that the book is an \\"oracle\\" able to provide answers on obscure mathematical concepts; in his view \\"The book has wit and humor; you’ll need persistence.\\" Gullberg commented, \\"At the start no 'real mathematician' would accept my book. And perhaps it was a bit crazy of me to write a book on mathematics, as it would be for a mathematician to write a book on surgery.\\"In the Swedish: \\"Till en början ville ingen »riktig matematiker» ta i min bok.

Two such vectors are adjacent when their inner product is 8\\\\. An alternative construction is based on the 8-vertex complete graph K8. The vertices of the Gosset graph can be identified with two copies of the set of edges of K8. Two vertices of the Gosset graph that come from the same copy are adjacent if they correspond to disjoint edges of K8; two vertices that come from different copies are adjacent if they correspond to edges that share a single vertex.. Properties In the vector representation of the Gosset graph, two vertices are at distance two when their inner product is −8 and at distance three when their inner product is −24 (which is only possible if the vectors are each other's opposite). In the representation based on the edges of K8, two vertices of the Gosset graph are at distance three if and only if they correspond to different copies of the same edge of K8. The Gosset graph is distance-regular with diameter three.. The induced subgraph of the neighborhood of any vertex in the Gosset graph is isomorphic to the Schläfli graph. The automorphism group of the Gosset graph is isomorphic to the Coxeter group E7 and hence has order 2903040. The Gosset 321 polytope is a semiregular polytope. Therefore, the automorphism group of the Gosset graph, E7, acts transitively upon its vertices, making it a vertex-transitive graph.

Ruckle was elected state senator in 1858 over Clackamas and Wasco counties. A Democrat, he represented District 2, but as Oregon had not yet entered the Union, there was no official session in 1858. He only served during the 1859 special session, the first meeting of the state legislature. In 1864 and 1865, he and George Thomas built the Thomas and Ruckle Road over the Blue Mountains. He also developed a quartz mine near Powder River that became known as the Virtue Mine.

It is situated in Hoensbroek, a town in the province of Limburg. This imposing watercastle is known as 'the most lordly stronghold between Rhine and Meuse'. The oldest part of the castle, notably the tall round tower, dates from around 1360, when it was built by Herman Hoen, though a predecessor to the castle had already existed in the swamp (or Gebrook) the castle was located in. This so-called motte-and-bailey dated from around 1225. In 1250 a fortified manor was built on the location of the present castle. Because of its important strategical location in the Duchy of Brabant, located along important trading routes to Maastricht, Aachen and Cologne, the castle was expanded in several phases, becoming the largest stronghold between the Meuse and the Rhine rivers. It contains at least 67 halls, rooms and living quarters. Founder and inhabitants The first lord of Hoensbroek was Sir Herman Hoen, who gave the castle its name (Herhoensbroeck). He was a member of the family Hoen van den / tzo Broeck, later changed to Hoen van Hoensbroek and Van Hoensbroeck. The name eventually passed to the later settlement of Hoensbroek (nowadays part of the municipality of Heerlen). Sir Herman Hoen's father, Claes, died in 1371 at the Battle of Baesweiler. Because of his support in the struggle against the Duchies of Jülich and Guelders, Herman Hoen was awarded the lordship Gebrook, Gebroek, Ingenbrouck (Broek being an old Dutch word for swamp, morass) in 1388 by duchess Joanna of Brabant, the lands in question being separated from the territory of Heerlen. The castle was the ancestral home of the knights Hoen van den Broeck, the Imperial baron Hoen van Hoensbroeck, and the Imperial counts and viscounts Van en tot Hoensbroeck for nearly six centuries. The family Van Hoensbroeck left the castle at the end of the 18th century, after which the castle entered a period of decay. Count Frans Lothar sold the castle in 1927 to the present day owners, the foundation 'Ave Rex Christe'. It was thoroughly restored between 1930 and 1940. During and shortly after the second world war, the castle and accompanying buildings were used for diverse ends. In 1945, the castle was used for war orphans, under the Carmelite Sisters. From 1951 to 1973 the writer-poet Bertus Aafjes lived in parts of the castle. In the period 1986-1989 another restoration took place. Since then it has formed a popular and educative museum destination, funded by the municipality. The complex Over the centuries the castle has received extensive rebuilding and expansion three times. The different architectural styles from the different centuries (14th, 17th and 18th) are easy to separate from each other. The complex is surrounded by a moat and has four wings situated around a rectangular courtyard. The main building is reachable over a bridge. The main building has two identical square towers with union-tops, flanking the entrance, and two taller half-separate corner towers of irregular shape at the backside. The forecastles are both U-formed and enclose two large inner courts. From 1720 to 1722, Frans Arnold, Imperial count van Hoensbroek, had substantial reworking done, including the building of a new north-western wing. The interior, with its illusionistic ceiling paintings from the 18th century, shows French influence. The son of Frans Arnold, Lotharius Frans, was the last lord of Hoensbroeck (1759–1794) who resided in the castle, until 1787, just before the French revolution.

For decades following its creation in the mid-19th century, this park was the city's only green space. The grounds include the city zoo (once home to the albino gorilla Snowflake, who died in 2003), the Palau del Parlament de Catalunya, a small lake, museums, and a large fountain designed by Josep Fontserè (with possible contributions by the young Antoni Gaudí). As the location of the Parliament of Catalonia, the tensions in 2018 and 2019 regarding Catalan independence regularly led to the police closure of the park to public access to prevent crowds forming near to the official buildings. Locations=Citadel Map of the military compound of Ciutadella In 1714, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Barcelona was laid siege for 13 months by the army of Philip V of Spain. The city fell, and in order to maintain control over it, and to prevent the Catalans from rebelling as they had in the previous century, Philip V built the citadel of Barcelona, at that time the largest fortress in Europe. A substantial part of the district it was constructed in (La Ribera) was destroyed to obtain the necessary space, leaving its inhabitants homeless. The fortress was characterized by having five corners, which gave the citadel defensive power, and by a rather wide surrounding margin, serving as location for the army's cannons. It included enough buildings to house 8,000 people. Hundreds of Catalans were forced to work on the construction for three years, while the rest of the city provided financial backing for this and for warfare-related expenses as well, with a new tax named el cadestre. Three decades later a quarter was rebuilt around the fortress named Barceloneta, which is located inside the neighborhood Ciutat Vella. In 1841 the city's authorities decided to destroy the fortress, which was hated by Barcelona's citizens. Yet two years later, in 1843, under the regime of Maria Cristina, the citadel was restored. In 1848, after Maria Cristina's abdication and as the citadel lost its use, General Espartero razed most of the buildings within the fortress as well as its walls by bombarding it from the nearby mountain fortress Montjuic, which helped him gain political popularity. By 1869, as the political climate liberalised enough to permit it, General Prim decided to turn over what was left of the fortress to the city and some buildings were demolished under Catalan orders, for it was viewed as by the citizens as a much-hated symbol of central Spanish government. The chapel (now the Military Parish Church of Barcelona), the Governor's palace (now Verdaguer Secondary School), and the arsenal (now home to the Catalan Parliament) remain, with the rest of the site being turned into the contemporary park by the architect Josep Fontsére in 1872. Nineteen years later, in 1888, Barcelona held the Exposición Universal de Barcelona extravaganza, inspired by Mayor Rius i Taulet, and the park was redesigned with the addition of sculptures and other complementary works of art. This marked the conclusion of the old provincial and unprogressive Barcelona and the establishment of a modern cosmopolitan city. From that point until 1892, half of the park's layout was enhanced again in order to obtain sufficient space for the zoo. The park's bandstand, ', is dedicated to a transsexual, Sonia Rescalvo Zafra, who was murdered there on 6 October 1991 by right-wing extremists.Plaque on the bandstand Cascada Quadriga de l'Aurora on the top of the Font de la cascada The lake in the Parc de la Ciutadella The Cascada (waterfall or cascade in Spanish) is located at the northern corner of the park opposite to the lake. It was first inaugurated in 1881 without sculptures or any meticulous details, and was thereby criticized by the press, after which this triumphal arch was thoroughly amended by the addition of a fountain and some minor attributes, which required six years of construction from 1882 to 1888, and was thenceforth put on display at the Universal Exhibition, and hitherto not been redesigned. It was erected by Josep Fontsére and to a small extent by Antoni Gaudí, who at that time was still an unknown student of architecture. Fontsére aimed to loosely make it bear resemblance to the Trevi Fountain of Rome. Two enormous pincers of gigantic crabs serve as stairs to access a small podium located in the centre of the monument. In front of it a sculpture (designed by Venanci Vallmitjana) of Venus standing on an open clam was placed. The whole cascade is divided in two levels. From the podium on a path leads to the Feminine Sculpture and to the northeastern corner of the park, and upon following the route down the stairs the fountain's pond is rounded and the southern tip of the artifact is reached. Zoo The zoo's main entrance The zoo of Barcelona is located in the park of the ciutadella due to the availability of a few buildings which were left empty after the Universal Exposition of 1888. It was inaugurated in 1892, during the day of the Mercé, the patron saint of the city. The first animals were donated by Lluís Martí i Codolar to the municipality of Barcelona, which gratefully approved of their accommodation in the zoo. Nowadays, with one of the most substantial collections of animals in Europe, the zoo affirms that their aim is to conserve, investigate, and educate. From 1966 to 2003 the zoo was home to the famous albino gorilla Snowflake, who attracted many international tourists and locals. Apart from the usual visits, different types of guided tours or other activities are offered, like for example 20 types of diversionary workshops, excursions and fieldtrips for schoolchildren, or personnel training and educational courses in zoology for adults. More than 50,000 children visit the zoo on an annual basis, which is the reason for the zoo's emphasis on education. Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona The facade of the Castle of the Three Dragons Ceramics on the facade of the Castle of the Three Dragons The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona comprises a museum of zoology and a museum of geology, both sited in the park, but also other science facilities elsewhere in Barcelona. The Museu Martorell (the Geology Museum) was administrated by the city of Barcelona from 1882 to 2010. The Museum of Zoology was administrated by the city from 1920 to 2010. Both museums are closed for the moment as the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona is planning new functions for them. The Castle of the Three Dragons was constructed for the Exposición Universal de Barcelona (1888) by the architect Lluís Doménech i Montaner to serve as an exhibition. Most of the building is constructed of red brick. Later, in 1920, it reopened as the museum of zoology. In the time when the museum was opened to the public, the most popular displays were the skeleton of a whale and exhibits dedicated for children. It also kept valuable collections from the animal kingdom; urban birds; and an apiary. The institute's stated aims were to enhance knowledge and conservation of the natural diversity of Catalonia and its surroundings, to promote public education on the natural world, to transmit ethical values of respect for nature, and to stimulate informed debate on the issues and environmental problems that concern society. The geology museum had permanent exhibitions on the subject of mineralogy, petrology and paleontology; the volcanic region of Olot; minerals' secret colors. Its collections are a legacy of the scientist Francisco Martorell i Peña (1822–1878), who donated his whole collection of artifacts of cultural and archeological importance, his scientific library, and an amount of 125,000 pesetas to the city for the purpose of creating a new museum. The building, built during the same year and named the Corporación Municipal, was designed by Antoni Rivas i Trias. Als Voluntaris Catalans  Als Voluntaris Catalans  The history of sculpture, a bronze nude of a young man with arms raised, dates back to 1918 when it was agreed to erect a monument to the Catalan volunteers killed on the battlefield under the Allied flags. The work was commissioned to Josep Clarà and its execution can be followed in the minutes of the municipal plenaries of the time. In 1923 the sculptor had already finished the monument, but the arrival to power of Primo de Rivera paralyzed the project. Francoist Spain made impossible to celebrate any public act of Catalan self-determination, so the inauguration had to be postponed for thirteen years. Initially, it was considered to place the work in the Lesseps square between the street of the Bishop Morgadas and the one of Septimanía but finally it was located in the park of the Ciutadella where it has remained until today. The sculpture was subject of violations in Francoist Spain. On the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress, in 1952, the monument was hidden by a huge screen. In December 1952 the statue's arms were cut off, so it was covered again with a box until its restoration. In 1954 the brass arms were restored and the young man's genitals got hidden with a vine leaf. The personal notes of the file of Clarà allow to follow in detail the displeasure of the sculptor about the treatment of his work. On the 75th anniversary of its inauguration, the shameful vine leaf has been removed, thus recovering the original nude that allows us to enjoy the work of Clarà as it was sculpted, in a new location on the shallow bank of the lake. Transport The Barcelona Metro and Trambesòs station Ciutadella-Vila Olímpica, on L4, is named after the park and the nearby area Vila Olímpica. The entrance to the park, however, is closer to the metro and Rodalies Barcelona (commuter train network) station Arc de Triomf. The city's central bus station Estació del Nord is also close.

They participated in over 60 episodes between 1968 and 1991. In addition, they were long-standing backing singers to many established artists, and perennial television performers. Career The Ladybirds had their origins in an earlier vocal group, the Vernons Girls. The original troupe disbanded at the start of the 1960s, but a smaller unit carried on, headed by Maureen Kennedy. Most of the other members performed as duets and singing trios. Amongst them were the Redmond Twins, the Breakaways, the Pearls, the DeLaine Sisters, and the longest surviving and best known, the Ladybirds. Founding member Margaret Elizabeth \\"Maggie\\" Stredder and Jean Ryder, billed as the Two Tones, appeared at United States Air Force bases in Germany, before returning to the UK to join Max Bygraves on stage. In 1962, following an appearance on the Val Doonican TV Special, Marian Davies had replaced Ryder, plus Gloria George was added, and The Ladybirds were born. After signing to Decca Records in August 1965, Marc Bolan recorded his debut single. The Ladybirds sang backing vocals, while apart from Bolan's vocals, all other music was created by studio session musicians. \\"The Wizard\\" was released on 19 November 1965. In 1966, the Ladybirds were recruited to provide vocal backing on BBC Television's Top of the Pops programme. They continued in this role until 10 August 1978, when they were replaced a week later by the Maggie Stredder Singers. They also appeared on a number of Twiggy's television shows. The same year, they sang as backing singers on the Mood Mosaic track \\"A Touch of Velvet – A Sting of Brass\\" – later to become Radio Caroline disc jockey Dave Lee Travis' (DLT) signature tune. The Ladybirds sang backing vocals on Sandie Shaw's 1967 British number one hit \\"Puppet on a String\\", joining Shaw for live performances in Vienna, Austria, when the song won the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as on records by Rolf Harris, Des O'Connor and many other hits and misses. In 1969, when Benny Hill joined Thames Television, he recruited them to The Benny Hill Show. The Ladybirds' first number was \\"Goin' Out of My Head\\". In 1971, Hill did a spoof of Top of the Pops, titled \\"Top of the Tops\\", but unusually, the Ladybirds were not on that programme. Instead, one of the musical guests, Petticoat & Vine, appeared in the sketch. The Ladybirds' later Broadway medley was unique in that each member sang independently, i.e. Stredder (\\"Don't Bring Lulu\\"), George (\\"I Won't Dance\\"), and Davies (\\"I Wanna Be Loved by You\\"). After that point, George left the trio. On the May 1973 album release Rigor Mortis Sets In by John Entwistle, the Ladybirds were credited as the backing vocalists. Up until 1973, the Ladybirds remained as a working trio of Gloria George, Maggie Stredder and Marian Davies. Penny Lister was then recruited for a short tenure. From the mid-1970s until 1986, the regular members became Stredder, Ann Simmons, who was another former Vernons Girl, and Laura Lee. Simmons later joined the Pearls. The Ladybirds also returned to Eurovision, backing Olivia Newton-John, singing on \\"Long Live Love\\", in the 1974 contest staged in Brighton, England. However, Ann Simmons was misidentified as her predecessor Gloria George. The Ladybirds appeared on many light entertainment shows on UK TV; the first series of Cilla in 1968, Lulu's Back in Town, The Les Dawson Show, The Two Ronnies, Morecambe and Wise, The Tommy Cooper Show, Little and Large, Shirley Bassey, The Paul Daniels Magic Show, The Generation Game and Children in Need, as well as an appearance on The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour in the United States. However, by 1978, when they returned to The Benny Hill Show purely as backing vocalists rather than actual performers, they also had stopped appearing on Top of the Pops. In 1977, the Ladybirds recorded songs for a low budget covers album. Tracks featured included \\"Chanson D'Amour\\", \\"Yes Sir, I Can Boogie\\" and \\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\\". The music compelled the all-female group to tackle songs made famous by male singers. On occasion, Tracy Miller and Joan Baxter boosted the Ladybird ranks. In 1979, they all provided backing vocals work on the Max Bygraves album, Discolongamax. The Ladybirds also sang on several orchestral albums by Benny Hill's Thames TV musical director, Ronnie Aldrich. In 2005, they appeared one more time on Mark Wirtz's Ear Theatre album Love Is Eggshaped: The Soundtrack. The track \\"Withdrawal\\" had vocals by the Ladybirds (by this time comprising Stredder, Kay Garner and Vicki Robinson). The Vernons Girls reformed as a trio after being invited to appear on the Cliff Richard 30th Anniversary Concert at Wembley Stadium, playing over the two evenings to an audience of 144,000. In more recent times, Stredder, Sheila Bruce and Penny Lister, reappeared billed as the Vernons Girls. Stredder later launched a successful career as an after dinner speaker, recalling her life in show business. She died on 9 March 2018, aged 82.

Starting with their own take on the conventional wisdom that the evolutionary process stopped when modern humans appeared, the authors explain the genetic basis of their view that human evolution is accelerating, illustrating it with some examples. Reviewers considered that while the book raised valuable questions, some assumptions also relied on discredited views. It has been criticized for history oversimplification, not allowing to make predictions about future human evolution and for racialism reification. Opinions in book Cochran and Harpending put forward the idea that the development of agriculture has caused an enormous increase in the rate of human evolution, including numerous evolutionary adaptations to the different challenges and lifestyles that resulted. Moreover, they argue that these adaptations have varied across different human populations, depending on factors such as when the various groups developed agriculture, and the extent to which they mixed genetically with other population groups. Such changes, they argue, include not just well- known physical and biological adaptations such as skin colour, disease resistance, and lactose tolerance, but also personality and cognitive adaptations that are starting to emerge from genetic research. These may include tendencies towards (for example) reduced physical strength, enhanced long-term planning, or increased docility, all of which may have been counter- productive in hunter-gatherer societies, but become favoured adaptations in a world of agriculture and its resulting trade, governments and urbanization. These adaptations are even more important in the modern world, and have helped shape today's nation states. The authors speculate that the scientific and Industrial Revolutions came about in part due to genetic changes in Europe over the past millennium, the absence of which had limited the progress of science in Ancient Greece. The authors suggest we would expect to see fewer adaptive changes among the Amerindians and sub-Saharan Africans, who have farmed for the shortest times and were genetically isolated from older civilizations by geographical barriers. In groups that had remained foragers, such as the Australian Aborigines, there would presumably be no such adaptations at all. This may explain why Indigenous Australians and many Native Americans have characteristic health problems when exposed to modern Western diets. Similarly, Amerindians, Aboriginals, and Polynesians, for example, had experienced very little infectious disease. They had not evolved immunities as did many Old World dwellers, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world. Summary The book's main thesis is that human civilisation greatly accelerated increases in the rates of evolution. The authors begin their discussion by providing two quotes they feel portray the conventional wisdom on this topic. First, they quote Ernst Mayr as stating in 1963: \\"Something must have happened to weaken the selective pressure drastically. We cannot escape the conclusion that man's evolution towards manness suddenly came to a halt.\\" Second, they quote Stephen J. Gould as stating in 2000: \\"There's been no biological change in humans in 40,000 or 50,000 years. Everything we call culture and civilization we've built with the same body and brain.\\" This had become the established viewpoint—when modern humans appeared, evolution was essentially over. The received wisdom is based on the doctrine that human minds are the same, everywhere: Bastian's Psychic Unity of Mankind. Unfortunately, the authors find, this is no more than wishful thinking. Were it true, human bodies would also be the same worldwide, which clearly they are not. Finns cannot be mistaken for Zulus, nor Zulus for Finns.The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilizations Accelerated Human Evolution (2009). Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. Basic Books, New York, NY, USA Not only are there strong reasons to believe that significant human evolution is theoretically possible, or even likely; it is completely obvious that it has taken place, since people are different from one another. The first four of the book's seven chapters serve as a preamble to the final three. First, Cochran and Harpending present evidence for recent, accelerated human evolution after the invention of agriculture. In itself, this argument represents a paradigm shift, albeit one that now has clear data to back it up. The International HapMap Project and other studies have shown that selection is ongoing and has accelerated over time. This has been a key discovery in human biology, and Cochran and Harpending, building on their own work and that of others such as John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, tie the advent of agriculture—and the selection pressures resulting from the new diets, new modes of habitation, new animal neighbors, and new modes of living that agriculture made possible—to this accelerating evolution. Neanderthals Wolpoff writes that Cochran and Harpending continue to refute conventional wisdom in their discussion of the Neanderthals. For natural selection to have a chance, they argue, there need to be favourable mutations, or favourable combinations of existing alleles such as genes for blue eyes or pale skin. Cochran and Harpending concentrate on the Neolithic farming revolution as the beginning of major population expansions that provided enough mutations to accelerate genetic change. Infectious diseases were another consequence of the early urban populations and soon became a new source of selection pressures. The origins of many recently adapted genes have now been traced to this period, creating effects such as regional differences in skin colour and skeletal gracility. Adaptations may have sacrificed muscle strength for higher intelligence and less aggressive human behaviours. By 5000 years ago, the authors estimate that adaptive alleles were coming into existence at a rate about 100 times faster than during the Pleistocene. This is the ‘‘explosion’’ of the book’s title. Research cited by Cochran and Harpending provides evidence of genetic mixing between modern humans and an ancient Homo lineage such as the Neanderthals. According to Cochran and Harpending, it supports the idea that modern humans could have benefited by acquiring adaptive alleles evolved by our Neanderthal relatives - in this case, microcephalin, an adaptive allele associated with brain development. Microcephalin (MCPH1) regulates brain size, and has evolved under strong positive selection in the human evolutionary lineage. One genetic variant of Microcephalin, which arose about 37,000 years ago, increased its frequency in modern humans too rapidly, they argue, to be compatible with neutral genetic drift. As anatomically modern humans emerged from Africa and spread across the globe, the \\"indigenous\\" Homo populations they encountered had already inhabited their respective regions for long periods of time and might have been better adapted to the local environments than the colonizers. It follows, it is argued, that modern humans, although probably superior in their own way, could have benefited from adaptive alleles gained by interbreeding with the populations they replaced, as was proposed to be the case for the brain-size- determining gene microcephalin. However, analysis of the genomes of neanderthals did not find the microcephalin gene variant in question to be present, and later studies have not found the gene variant to be associated with mental ability. Agriculture Farming, which, the authors note, produces 10 to 100 times more calories per acre than foraging, carried this trend further. Over the period from 10,000 BC to AD 1, the world population increased about a hundredfold - estimates range from 40 to 170 times. An accelerated rate of evolution is a direct result of the larger human population. More people will have more mutations, thereby increasing opportunity for evolutionary change under natural selection. The spread of rapidly expanding populations eventually outpaced the spread of favourable mutations under selection in those populations, so for the first time in human history favourable mutations could not fully disperse throughout the human species. In addition, of course, selection pressures changed once farming was adopted, favouring distinctive adaptations in different geographic areas. Gene flow About halfway through the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to consider two different ways of looking at the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time. Expansions From that platform the authors discuss ideas that range from the possible origins of the Arthurian legend in Britain to the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Others have attempted this, for example in Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel.Jared Diamond (1997), Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years, London: Vintage, 2005 [1997], But, according to Kelleher, Cochran and Harpending go one better than Diamond. He goes on to state that where Diamond was content with environmental determinism, at times opposing the roles of human biology and population differences, Cochran and Harpending embrace them both. Their discussion of gene flow becomes the core of an argument for biology as central to history, and the backdrop for the book's two major hypotheses. The first seeks to resolve a longstanding debate in historical linguistics by making a case for the Kurgan hypothesis on the origins of the Indo-European language group. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the Black and Caspian seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk- drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history's greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, Scythians, Arabs, or Mongols. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors’ argument makes it difficult to imagine the language in which their book would have been written, were it not for the ability to digest milk. Ashkenazi Jews The second major argument, which takes up the final chapter, sets out to explain why Ashkenazi Jews have a mean IQ so much higher than that of the population in general, as well as a higher rate of some genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease. This argument had been published previously in an earlier paper. This hypothesis proposes that from A.D. 800 until around 1700, Askhenazi Jews were restricted to professions that required high intelligence, and that this produced a selective pressure in favor of intelligence. When faced with a sudden threat, evolution may favor any change that offers protection, and Cochran and Harpending propose that selection for genes promoting high intelligence thus had the side effect of also selecting for these genetic disorders. The hypothesis has drawn a mixed reaction from scientists, with some arguing the hypothesis is highly implausible, and others regarding it as worth considering. According to cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, this theory \\"meets the standards of a good scientific theory, though it is tentative and could turn out to be mistaken.\\"Pinker, S. \\"Groups and Genes\\". The New Republic, June 26, 2006. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, these claims were based on the work of discredited psychologist Kevin MacDonald. Reception The paleoanthropologist Milford H. Wolpoff praised the book's central thesis as being insightful and worthy of further research, while also criticizing the book for its reification of biological race, and its dubious or oversimplified view of history. In New Scientist, Christopher Willis wrote that the \\"evidence the authors present an overwhelming case that natural selection has recently acted strongly on us\\". However, Willis criticizes the authors for not discussing what the \\"recent and continuing evolution means for our species as a whole\\". Willis concludes by saying that \\"the book offers a limited and biased interpretation of some very exciting research\\". In Evolutionary Psychology, Gregory Gorelik and Todd K. Shackelford wrote, \\"Although many of their arguments need more fleshing out and some may not withstand the assault of further scientific analysis, the authors are stunningly creative when considering human history. If even a handful of their arguments survive the onslaught of rigorous scientific scrutiny, Cochran and Harpending will have offered a valuable and novel approach to addressing questions of recent human evolution.\\" In Evolution and Human Behavior, anthropologist Edward Hagen wrote that the book makes \\"many unsupported and often questionable assertions\\", but it is nevertheless valuable in raising \\"bold questions about major historical encounters between populations — Neanderthal and modern humans, German tribes and Romans, Europeans and Native Americans — in light of formidable (but not unassailable) arguments from population genetics\\". Hagen considered that it \\"should also be on the summer reading list of all evolutionary social scientists\\". Anthropologist Cadell Last wrote that by using race as a natural fact, the book \\"undermines the attempt to find a legitimate scientific approach to understanding recent human evolution and conceptualizing human genetic diversity\\" and that it was \\"unfortunate\\" that it had received \\"praise from prominent, influential well- established biological anthropologists\\" such as John D. Hawks. Evolutionary anthropologist Keith Hunley, writing for the Journal of Anthropological Research, described the book's thesis as interesting, but said the list of behavioral adaptations supposedly favored by agricultural lifeways was \\"bizarre\\". Per Hunley, the authors \\"provide no evidence whatsoever that there is any genetic basis to the specific behaviors in their list.\\" Hunley specifically criticizes the last chapter on Ashkenazim for being based on shoddy or fabricated data, and for failing to mention the human suffering caused by pseudoscientific racism. Hunley says the book \\"fails utterly\\" to meet the stringent scientific standards of behavioral genetic research. According to a review in the Financial Times, \\"Interestingly, the authors make no predictions for our future. And accordingly, biologists – as opposed to social scientists – may not find their thesis all that novel. But it is an engaging book with valuable information about how advantageous genes spread through a population.\\" In Seed, T.J. Kelleher wrote that \\"The strength and sheer number of the book’s best sections, however, more than overshadow the wanness and paucity of its worst. Even with its flaws, Cochran and Harpending’s book has provided the best example to date of what E.O. Wilson would recognize as consilient history\\". Reporter Ben Schreckinger, writing for Politico in 2017, listed the book among the canon of works which influenced the alt-right's worldview.

Sir Francis Henry Evans, 1st Baronet, (29 August 1840 – 22 January 1907) was a British civil engineer, businessman and Liberal Party politician. Family and education Evans was born at Crumpsall Grange in LancashireThe Times, 24 January 1907, p. 6 the son of William Evans of Manchester and his wife Mary, née Nicholson.The Times, 27 June 1893, p. 3 His sister Emily Evans was married to the Industrialist and Politician Sir Charles Seely, 1st Baronet, and his nephew was the Secretary of State for War (1912–1914) J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone. He was educated at the Moravian School in Neuwied in the Rhineland-Palatinate on the banks of the River Rhine and then at Manchester New College, London. In 1872, he married the widow of Irving Van Wart, Marie de Grasse Stevens, the daughter of the Hon Samuel Stevens of Albany, New York, who, though described in The Times as sometime New York State Attorney General, never in fact held that position, having lost the nomination by three votes in January 1839.Hammond, Jabez D. – The History of Political Parties in the State of New-York, Vol II (3d Edition), p. 511, H. & E. Phinney, Cooperstown (1844) They had three sons and two daughters.Who was Who, OUP 2004–08 Career=Civil engineering It was first intended that Evans should become a civil engineer. He was therefore articled to Sir James Brunlees with whom he worked on a number of projects including the construction of the London and North Western Railway system. Under Brunlees' direction, Evans worked on the construction of a railway in Brazil. He then went to America with his father during the time of the Civil War and travelled extensively, including taking part in scouting expeditions in Texas. Banking and shipping While in the United States, Evans got involved in business, finding he had a flair for banking in particular. He went on to found the firm Melville, Evans & Company conducting banking transactions between business interests in Britain and America. He later diversified into shipping and in 1880 he joined the board of Union Steamship Company rising to become chairman and managing director. In 1900, the company merged with the Castle Line to form the Union-Castle Line and Evans joined the firm of Donald Currie & Co, managers of the Union-Castle Line, and remained a partner until he died. Newfoundland  Evans had substantial business interests in Newfoundland, then a colony of Great Britain. It was probably Evans' knowledge of railway construction that led to his involvement in Newfoundland affairs. In 1881, a syndicate known as the Newfoundland Railway Company, under the direction of A. L. Blackman of New York, obtained government support to build a railway from St. John's to Hall's Bay at the western end of Notre Dame Bay. Melville, Evans and Company arranged much of the financing needed before work could begin. When the Newfoundland Railway Company declared bankruptcy in 1884, Melville, Evans and Company were appointed receivers of the company on behalf of the bondholders, and also as operators of the railway, which they did for 12 years, until the government purchased the railway in 1896. A document dated 1892 lists Evans as Receiver and Manager of the Southern Division of the Newfoundland Railway. Further involvement in Newfoundland affairs, perhaps because of his knowledge of Newfoundland and his experience with the railway deal, resulted in Evans' appointment to a commission representing the interests of the Newfoundland government in their fisheries dispute with France in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It is claimed that Evans' work on this commission contributed greatly towards his knighthood in 1893, prior to being made a baronet in 1902. Thereafter Evans always took a special interest in Newfoundland affairs when they were discussed in Parliament.The Times, 10 March 1899, p. 10.The Times, 16 March 1899, p. 6 Other business interests Evans was a sometime director of the Thames and Mersey Marine Insurance Company and of the International Sleeping Car Company. Politics Evans was said to be a friend of the Prime Minister W E Gladstone and seems to have been drawn into politics through that acquaintanceship. He was first returned to Parliament at a by- election in May 1888 as one of the two members of parliament (MP) for Southampton. Evans was not in the country during the election campaign. He was on a ship returning to England from Newfoundland.The Times, 18 May 1888, p. 10. He arrived to find himself an MP, the campaign having been conducted in his absence and his interests having been represented by his wife. He was re- elected in 1892, but lost the seat at the 1895 general election to the Liberal Unionist candidate Sir John Simeon. However, the election of Southampton's other MP, the Conservative Tankerville Chamberlayne, was declared void on petition, and in February 1896 Evans won the resulting by-election with a majority of only 33 votes (0.2%). He was defeated again by Chamberlayne at the general election in October 1900, but a vacancy soon occurred in Maidstone, where the election had been voided on petition.Craig, op. cit., page 147 Evans won the Maidstone by-election on 1 March 1901, but lost the seat in 1906. Honours and appointments Evans was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1893.The Times, 10 August 1893, p. 7. Later that year he was appointed to the Commission of Lieutenancy of the City of London.The Times, 18 November 1893, p. 107. In 1894 he was appointed to a Board of Trade committee to look into the undermanning of British ships and the proper penalties for those sending such ships to sea.The Times, 12 May 1894, p. 9. He later sat on another Board of Trade enquiry into the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.The Times, 20 March 1895, p. 8. In 1896, Evans was made a Vice-President of the City of London Liberal Association. Among the other men similarly appointed at the same time was future party leader H H Asquith.The Times, 20 June 1896, p. 6. It was announced that he would receive a baronetcy in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 for the (subsequently postponed) coronation of King Edward VII, and on 24 July 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Tubbendens, in the parish of Farnborough, in the county of Kent.name=\\"Who was Who, OUP 2004-08\\" Death Evans died of Angina pectoris, at his London home in Grosvenor Place, on 22 January 1907 aged 66 after a short illness.The Times, 26 January 1907, p. 7. He was buried in Orpington in Kent where he had a home, Tubbendens.The Times, 28 January 1907, p. 8. Papers A journal kept by Sir Francis Evans for over thirty years and containing extracts from another book (now missing) in which he kept family and business records and the signatures of those present at his Christmas dinner, is deposited in the Local Studies and Archives section of the Bromley Public Library. The journal is written in an informal lively style, mainly detailing his widespread travels at home and abroad, family problems and illnesses, and his own accounts of events affecting his political and business career. For example, the entry for 19 September 1873 has a dramatic description of a 'run' on his bank, Jay, Cooke, McCulloch & Co., the reasons for which are not clear, but by 1879 two of his partners had left the firm, one of whom, Puleston, he sued ostensibly for having embezzled £10,000 for speculative investment. Not until 1882 can he record that 'I consider myself well repaid for all the work and annoyance the suit imposed on me.' In 1888, while he was in America, the Southampton by- election (at which he was standing) was held, and he gives his own exciting version of the hectic travelling to get back as soon as possible, and his attempts on arrival to discover the result from the ship's pilots. He also recounts his tumultuous reception and ascribes his success in the election wholly to his wife's efforts in his absence. Some papers relating to Evans’ business activities in Newfoundland are deposited in the Archives and Special Collections, Queen Elizabeth II Library, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada. This collection consists of a copy of a deposition given by Francis Henry Evans, in his capacity as receiver and manager of the Southern Division of the Newfoundland Railway, to agents of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland at London on 17 & 18 July 1896, in a case by Evans against the Government of Newfoundland for breach of contract. In addition to the 15 pages of testimony there are copies of a number of pieces of correspondence relevant to the case and a copy of a petition from Evans to the Newfoundland Governor seeking restitution.

MacKenzie-Richards was engaged in testing night navigating devices at Croydon aerodrome, including two new illuminated wind vanes erected there experimentally. Bristol F.2 Fighter On Wednesday, 9 November 1927, flying Bristol fighter C810, MacKenzie-Richards had finished his work at 5.30pm and left Croydon with Professor Harry Norman Green. Green (born 21 September 1902 in Sheffield, England; died 16 May 1967) was educated at the Central Secondary School in Sheffield, and received his undergraduate and medical degrees from Sheffield University, specialising in pathology. He taught at the Sheffield University (1926–1933, 1935–1953), Cambridge University (1933–1935), and the University of Leeds (1953–1967). Green's research interests focused on the immune system in cancer induction and growth. In 1947 Green was appointed Director of Cancer.James Stuart Olson, ed., The History of Cancer: An Annotated Bibliography (ABC-CLIO, 1989):4 a pathologist and member of the faculty of medicine (and later the Department of Pharmacology) at the University of Sheffield,Harry Norman Green, Papular urticaria (University of Sheffield, Faculty of Medicine, 1927). as his observer. They attempted to make their way back to Farnborough, but the compass was 30 degrees out when they left. Failing to find Farnborough they attempted to return to Croydon. They flew back without seeing anything they recognised until they estimated they were over Croydon. They could not pick up any indication of Croydon nor could they see any lights. They spoke on the 'telephone' and MacKenzie-Richards suggested that they had better make a forced landing before they ran out of petrol – they only had about 20 minutes fuel remaining. He came down low and asked Green to look for a field. Presently he said that he could not see a field that he could land in and he lit a flare. There was a certain amount of mist, but nothing exceptional. They just missed some trees and climbed back up to 2,000 feet. As Green had never used a parachute before, MacKenzie-Richards briefed him particularly about not pulling the ripcord until he was clear of the aircraft. Green questioned whether the aircraft could be rolled onto its back so that they could both get out, but MacKenzie-Richards refused, saying that Green should go. At the inquest Green explained how he had one foot on the seat and one on the side waiting for the signal to jump. MacKenzie-Richards throttled the engine down and turned around, put his hand out and pushed Green. Green landed in a field and was perfectly alright. MacKenzie-Richards was found in another field, but there was no sign of life; his parachute was open. The Coroner's conclusion was that by the time MacKenzie-Richards left the aircraft he was too close to the ground and that his parachute failed to fully deploy.The Times (14 November 1927). At the inquest a Major Cooper informed the Court that the compasses were checked periodically on the ground, and that he was satisfied that this compass had been tested at certain periods. He pointed out that this had been an experimental aircraft, which had certain experimental lights, and the evidence suggested that one of the pieces of wiring had an effect on the compass after the machine had left the ground. It was quite possible that the error in the compass only occurred when the current was generated. The wreckage of the aircraft was found in a wood about two hundred yards from where his body was found. He is buried at the parish church of St. Andrew, Great Yeldham.\\"Monumental Inscriptions\\", Seax – Essex Archives Online, http://seax.essexcc.gov.uk/result_details.asp?DocID=513067.

Appearance event ordination Appearance Event Ordination (AEO) is a superior form of dating fossil collections, according to Alroy. Age assignments to North American land mammals are provided for comparison and may disagree with the AEO estimates because they are taken straight from published sources. Therefore, the assignments reflect the subjective opinions of the authors who described the fossils. They are not based on quantitative analyses of faunal and biostratigraphic data. \\"AEO age estimates are preferable because they are objective, repeatable, and quantitative. That's because AEO uses explicitly recorded and clearly defined numerical data, and because it uses algorithmic search and optimization criteria instead of verbal argumentation.\\" References *http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy/ University of California, Santa Barbara.

The cabin was owned and occupied by former President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt and his wife Edith Kermit Roosevelt, and used by Roosevelt and the first lady while he was president, although no official business took place there. In 1905, Mrs. Roosevelt spent $280 to purchase the fifteen-acre property with its rustic worker's cabin, and she bought an additional seventy-five acres in 1911. The cabin is owned by the Edith and Theodore Roosevelt Pine Knot Foundation and is open for visits by appointment. Background The idea of purchasing the cabin was to be an escape for both the First Lady and the President. President Roosevelt was known throughout his presidency to travel frequently, many times to experience the natural wonders of certain areas such as in the states of Oklahoma and Colorado. While traveling Mrs. Roosevelt decided to purchase the property after visiting family friends Joe and Will Wilmer on May 6, 1905. Realizing her husband's love for the surrounding countryside, Mrs. Roosevelt decided to purchase the cabin to help her and her husband \\"rest and repair\\" from the strain of political life in Washington D.C. The cabin was surrounded by the wilderness, which appealed to Mrs. Roosevelt. A description characterized it thus: \\"tucked away among red and white oak, red cedars, dogwoods, red maples and black cherry trees, was a rustic worker's cabin\\".Douglas Brinkley. The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America (2009), pp. 615-616 The cabin was built in 1905, and is a simple two-story, single-pile frame dwelling.

The system is designed to arm small displacement ships and comprises the Gun Mount with a MR-123-02/76 Fire Control Radar System. It has high survivability owing to autonomous use of the gun mount controlled from the optical sight in the absence of control from the radar system, as well as a capability for fire even if power supply is lost. Design The gun is fed by 152 ready to fire rounds and has selectable rates of fire of 30, 60 and 120 rounds per minute. The 120 r.p.m. rate is achieved by firing a burst of 75, but afterwards the gun has to cool off for 30 minutes. The AK-176 is effective against missiles, being able to shoot down AT-2 Swatter (simulating a Harpoon anti-ship missile), taking an average of 25 rounds per kill. In the late 1980s an upgraded version the AK-176M, with a new fire control system MR-123-02, television targeting and a laser rangefinder, was introduced. This gun, is still in production (AK-176M1) and is the primary medium-caliber artillery systems to all small Soviet ships and is widely exported. AK-176MA, a further upgrade of the design intended for newer ship classes, such as the Karakurt-class corvettes and project 22160-class patrol ships, completed its trials in 2017. The AK-176MA features improved accuracy, a stealthy turret design, and a significantly reduced weight of under 9 tonnes. It will replace older guns on carrier ships on the process of their modernization.http://www.armstrade.org/includes/periodics/news/2019/0711/125053368/detail.shtml The equivalent NATO system is the Otobreda 76 mm, another 120 rpm 3 inches gun, but the Soviet weapon predated it by several years, being in service since late '70s, while the 3rd gen Oto was ready around the mid '80s. H/PJ-26 The 713th Institute (also known as Zhengzhou Electrical Engineering Research Institute) of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) of the People's Republic of China has developed a Chinese variant of AK-176, with Mr. Chen Dingfeng (陈汀峰) as the general designer. Design begun in 2000 and was completed in 2003. The primary difference between this H/PJ-26 and AK-176 is that the Chinese variant adopts a stealthy turret design, and more composite material is used in the construction of the turret. In addition, ready rounds for the H/PJ-26 are doubled to 150 rounds from the original 75 of the AK-176.

Privately-owned but operated by the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority (HART), service commenced on June 27, 1985. Due to low ridership and operating losses, the service was discontinued on January 16, 1999. The money given to the city for the closure of the system in a settlement with ownership served as the foundation of an endowment to cover the operating expenses of the TECO Line Streetcar. Description Developed by the Beneficial Corporation and utilizing Otis Transportation Systems, the people mover was completed at a cost of $7 million. The concrete guideway was elevated and spanned the Garrison Channel. Operating between 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m, the Harbour Island People Mover made approximately 620 trips per day with a maximum capacity of 100 passengers per trip. The system ran in a north–south direction between the downtown station located on the third level of the Old Fort Brooke parking garage and its southern terminus at the Shops of Harbour Island on Harbour Island. History Ground was broken for the project on September 20, 1983, as a part of the greater Harbour Island development project undertaken by Beneficial Corporation and its chief executive Finn M. W. Caspersen. When the Harbour Island People Mover opened for service on June 27, 1985, it marked the return of rail transit to Tampa since the closure of its streetcar network in 1946. Costing $7 million to complete, former President Gerald Ford took part in the inaugural ride. Although it opened to much fanfare, ridership of the system remained relatively low. By 1989, ridership averaged 1,200 riders on a weekday and 1,500 on the weekend or for an average of about 2 riders per trip. The low ridership was attributed to the perceived difficulty in accessing the downtown station and the addition of a lunch-time shuttle bus service between downtown and Harbour Island by January 1989. By 1995, the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization approved funding to initiate the preliminary engineering for the construction of a third station at the Tampa Convention Center. With the system losing approximately $1 million between 1994–95 due to increasing operating costs and dwindling ridership due to the closure of the Shops of Harbour Island, Beneficial Corporation sought to sell the system to HART for only $1. However, since the system was losing substantial amounts of money, HART declined to purchase the it from Beneficial. By July, Beneficial announced the people mover would cease operations if the convention center station was not completed along the line. With the prospects of a convention center station stalling, by 1998 Beneficial was looking to shut down the people mover. As a result of a contract with HART calling for the agency to be in charge of operating the system for thirty years, negotiations had to be undertaken with the city to dissolve the contract since it was good through 2015. By May 1998, an agreement was reached calling for the dismantling of the people mover system and for Beneficial to pay the city $5 million to dissolve the contract. Harbour Island would then be served by trolleybuses and the majority of the settlement money would go to an endowment to be used in the operating costs of the subsequently built TECO Line Streetcar. The line ceased operations on January 16, 1999. After determining the Garrison Channel bridge was unsuitable for use as a pedestrian crossing, demolition began in November 1999 and was completed by February 2000. Today, the Harbour Island station, located inside the Knights Point commercial development serves as Jackson's Bistro Bar & Sushi restaurant's private Waterfront Room. The elevator leading up to this room still titles the level as the People Mover. The downtown station in the parking garage serves as parking administration offices.

Denmark-Norway was forced to lift the first siege in 1700, but a combined force of the anti-Swedish coalition successfully besieged and took Tönning in 1713–1714. 1700 The first siege was one of the first military actions of the Great Northern War. Denmark-Norway, Saxe-Poland-Lithuania and Russia had agreed on invading the Swedish Empire on three fronts, and accordingly, Danish forces moved into Holstein-Gottorp,Frost (2000), p.228 allied and dynastically tied to Sweden,Frost (2000), p.227 and laid siege to Tönning in March 1700. The siege had to be lifted when Charles XII of Sweden, backed by the Maritime Powers, in a surprise move deployed an army in front of Copenhagen, forcing Frederik IV of Denmark-Norway out of the war by the Peace of Travendal on 18 August 1700.Frost (2000), p.229 Denmark re-entered the war only in 1709 as a consequence of the Swedish defeat at Poltava.Frost (2000), p.294 1713–1714 In early 1713, forces of the Swedish Empire and Holstein- Gottorp were encircled by a combined Russian and Saxe-Polish army in a pocket around Tönning. The Swedish force consisted of the remains of Magnus Stenbock's 16,000 men who had broken out of the Stralsund pocket, and ignoring orders to march into Poland turned west, defeated a Danish army the Battle of Gadebusch and pursued their remains into Holstein. The Russian and Saxe-Polish allies of Denmark sent 36,000 troops after Stenbock.Wilson (1998), p.139 In February 1713, breaching his proclaimed neutrality,Jakubowski-Tiessen (1983), p.157 the minor duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-GottorpBushkovitch (2001), p.310 provided Stenbock with shelter and auxiliaries at his fortress of Tönning in anticipation of support by the Maritime Powers, expecting a recurrence of the 1700 precedent. Yet, the Maritime Powers did not intervene, and the trapped, still 9,000 strong force of Stenbock ran out of supplies. When the food situation deteriorated and 2,800 Swedes fell ill, Stenbock surrendered on 16 May 1713.Wilson (1998), p.140 The 1,600 strong Holstein garrison of the Tönning fortress held out until 7 February 1714.Jakubowski- Tiessen (1983), p.158 Danish forces, in pursuit of a royal occupation order of 13 March 1713, gained complete control over Holstein-Gottorp when the last Holsteiners loyal to Sweden were captured in 1715. After Tönning's surrender, its defensive works and palace were leveled until 1735.Klose (1958), p.259 Görtz The decision of the duke of Holstein-Gottorp to open Tönning to Stenbock as well as the brokering of the Swedish surrender is ascribed to baron Georg Heinrich von Görtz, a diplomat at Charles Frederick's court. The Swedish captives were partitioned equally among the victorious powers, despite orders Russian commander Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov had received from tsar Peter the Great to secure the greatest share for Russia, arguing that the Russians had provided the largest contingent in the combined army. The disobedience led to rumors that Menshikov was bribed by Görtz.

This movie was his directorial debut feature, about two brothers seeking revenge against the members of the legal system who sentenced them to Death Row. Curfew, like Out of the Rain (1991), his second film, were \\"little-seen thrillers, the former so violent that it suffered censorship and certification problems\\" in the United Kingdom. In fact, the film was rejected for video by the British Board of Film Classification in 1988 and was finally released fully uncut in 2002.  Plot  The Movieweb website provides a terse synopsis: \\"Two escaped brothers track down the people who sentenced them to death row, including a doctor and the judge. But when they get to the D.A. and his family they have an especially lengthy revenge plot in mind for them.\\" John Bush of Rovi also provides a recap in The New York Times: \\"After late- night carousing on too many weekends and having her parents impose a curfew upon her, a teen-age girl (Kyle Richards) speeds home to keep from winding up in hot water again but finds when she gets home that two escaped convicts (Wendell Wellman, John Putch) have taken her family hostage.\\" Keith Bailey of the Unknown Movies website provides a lengthier synopsis: > The movie concerns what happens one night to a family called the Davenports. > Man of the house Walter (Frank Miller) is the town's successful district > attorney, and he is married to a woman named Megan (Jean Brooks).

The prosecutor, along with his > wife and yummy Demi Moore look-alike daughter are held hostage and their > only chance to survive is for [Stephanie Davenport] to set the murdering > siblings against each other.

A reviewer for the Bride of Crapula website (a site whose motto seems to be \\"Quite how bad does cinema get? Just what depths are plumbed in the name of entertainment?\\") did consider \\"the creepy exterior of a seemingly innocent house on the DVD cover – soaked blood red to match the title (and cutely appealing tagline)\\" as \\"a plus\\". The reviewer, giving Curfew a rating of 3.8/10, compares this film with Cape Fear, though unfavorably, before going on to say: > And that's basically it.

Miller (ed.), Anglo-Scottish Relations, from 1900 to Devolution and Beyond, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp.232-233 He was born into a farming family in Staindrop, County Durham, and went to school in nearby Gainford. He studied science at University College, Nottingham and worked briefly as a schoolteacher before joining the staff under A. J Herbertson at the then-new School of Geography at Oxford University. He was later a lecturer at University College, Southampton, and Leeds University. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Geography at University College London, where he remained until his retirement in 1949.John Dean, \\"The barefoot evangelist\\" , The Northern Echo, 24 May 2004. Retrieved 14 July 2013 He gained national attention for his essay Provinces of England, published in 1919, in which he developed the thinking of Patrick Geddes in suggesting a process of survey and development planning across large regions of England. He subdivided England into 12 \\"Provinces\\" - much larger than the county councils which at that time were the next level of government to the national level - and proposed that much regional planning should be carried out at a \\"provincial\\" level, crossing existing local authority boundaries. He claimed that \\"there is nothing sacrosanct in the boundaries of the administrative sub-divisions of England\\", while recognising that regional boundaries should \\"pay regard to local patriotism and to tradition\\". In many ways, Fawcett's thinking foreshadowed much of the development planning system that was applied in England in the second half of the twentieth century, and initiatives towards regional government in England. His books included Frontiers, a Study in Political Geography (1918) and A Political Geography of the British Empire (1933).

He is the leader of the political party Freedom and Solidarity and currently serving as Deputy Prime Minister for Finance and Minister of Economy in Government of Slovakia led by Igor Matovič.  Life  Born in 1968 in Czechoslovakia, Sulík emigrated in 1980 with his parents to West Germany, where they lived in the city of Pforzheim. In 1987 he went to Munich to study physics and later economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University. When the borders were reopened right after the end of the cold war, Sulík returned in 1991 to Czechoslovakia. While still a student at the University of Economics in Bratislava, he ran the company FaxCOPY. When he graduated in 2003, Sulík was working as a special advisor of the Slovak Minister of Finance Ivan Miklos, whom he convinced to take his master thesis as a blueprint for the 2004 Slovak tax reform. This tax reform, introducing a 19% flat tax on all types of income and a 19% value added tax, was believed to be the single most important reform leading to the large increase of foreign investment in Slovakia and the economic boom period. After the reform was put through, he remained in the Advisory Board of the Ministry. Between 2004 and 2006, Sulìk was CEO of a municipal waste disposal company, OLO. He then returned as special advisor to the Ministry of Finance under Ján Počiatek in order to further evolve the tax system. In 2009, Sulík founded the political party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) which he leads as Chairman. In 2010 he replaced Pavol Paška as the Speaker of Parliament.  Financial crisis  On 14 September 2011, Richard Sulik, the President of the Parliament and leader of his party, which is member of the European Conservatives and Reformists, the third largest political party of the European Parliament, announced that he would not vote for an increase of the funds for the European Financial Stability Facility, believing that allowing Greece to go bankrupt would be a better solution for the rest of the Eurozone member countries. On 11 October 2011, his party did not vote for the European Financial Stability Facility enlargement even though Prime Minister Iveta Radičová tied the vote with a confidence vote for the government, thus toppling the Slovak government. Refugee crisis A former migrant himself, Sulík has strongly opposed the acceptance of subsidiarily protected migrants from the Middle East, and has expressed anti-Islamic views, stating that \\"I don't want to live in a Europe where more Muslims are born than Christians\\".http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/menschen-bei-maischberger ---richard-sulik-mischt-talkrunde-mit-harschen-thesen-zur-fluechtlingskrise- auf-6537222.html#  See also  * Politics of Slovakia  References  External links  * Richard Sulík's homepage * Richard Sulík's blog Category:1968 births Category:Freedom and Solidarity MEPs Category:Freedom and Solidarity politicians Category:Living people Category:MEPs for Slovakia 2014–2019 Category:Speakers of the National Council (Slovakia) Category:University of Economics in Bratislava alumni ","title":"Richard Sulík"},{"id":"25843784","text":"Minuscule 557 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 356 (in the Soden numbering), is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, on a parchment.

She was the only surviving child of Frederick Augustus II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg by his first wife Princess Elisabeth Anna of Prussia. Sophia Charlotte (\\"Lotte\\") is best known for her unhappy and well-publicized marriage to Prince Eitel Friedrich, second son of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. The marriage later led to divorce; Sophia Charlotte would remarry a few years later to Harald van Hedemann, a former police officer. Family and early life Sophia Charlotte (or \\"Lotte\\") was born on 2 February 1879 in the dynastic residence Oldenburg Castle in Oldenburg, Germany. She was the eldest child of Frederick Augustus, the then Hereditary Grand Duke of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg and his wife Elisabeth Anna of Prussia. Sophia Charlotte had a younger sister named Margaret, but she died young. She was named after Sophia Charlotte of Hanover, the wife of the first Prussian king Frederick I. Sophia Charlotte was her father's constant companion as they went yachting on trips together; due to these trips, she always had a great love of water like her father. She spent much of her girlhood abroad, and often visited her maternal aunt Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn in London. She also often stayed with her widowed maternal grandmother Princess Frederick Charles of Prussia in Italy. Oldenburg Castle, the place of Sophia Charlotte's birth. Sophia Charlotte's mother died in 1895, and her father remarried the next year to Duchess Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. This second union gave Sophia Charlotte four half-siblings, which would come to include Nikolaus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg and Duchess Altburg, later Hereditary Princess of Waldeck and Pyrmont. They all resided together at the newly built Elisabeth-Anna- Palais (named after her mother). This second marriage made Sophia Charlotte's home life unhappy, and she was glad to escape once a suitable marriage was offered.Schwering, p. 91. Her father succeeded as Grand Duke of Oldenburg in 1900. Early press accusations There had always been a fear that Sophia Charlotte had inherited her mother's delicate health, so sojourns to various spa towns was a common component of her childhood. In 1904, a German journalist was sentenced to a month in prison for alluding to the relations between Sophia Charlotte and an adjutant of her father's. He had written an article about her return from a long stay on the Riviera \\"for her health\\". He alluded to her \\"illness\\" as the same that afflicted two princesses of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, about whose morals there had been much gossip. As these long stays were a common aspect of her childhood, rumours like these were without basis. Initial meetings with Prince Eitel In June 1905, Sophia Charlotte first met Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia at the wedding of his brother Crown Prince Wilhelm to Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. They were both sons of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein. In Kiel later that month, Sophia Charlotte became better acquainted with him. Eitel's mother in particular desired the match, as she wanted her son to marry one of the Oldenburgs (a family considered quiet, inoffensive, and suitable for a prince).Le Queux, p. 21. The Oldenburgs were also an ancient family with strong ties to both the Empress and Emperor (as Sophia Charlotte's mother had been a Prussian princess). Her family also had other strong ties to the Hohenzollerns, as Sophia Charlotte's mother had been a great intimate of the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen, the Emperor's sister. The Duchess was also Sophia Charlotte's godmother, and Sophia Charlotte was herself a favourite of the Emperor. Her closeness to the Prussian court was so pronounced in fact that it had even sparked some early rumours that she would marry Prince Wilhelm instead. Wilhelm had been allowed to choose however, and had settled on Duchess Cecilie. In September 1905, Eitel traveled to Lensahn, an Oldenburg residence, for several weeks duration. They soon became engaged. The strong pressure on Eitel's side (despite his supposed reluctance), along with the desire of Sophia Charlotte to leave her home, may have been the real cause of their betrothal. There had been many rumours leaking out about Eitel's actions as a soldier, both on the field and off it, so his parents were no doubt eager to see him married off to a seemingly respectable and virtuous bride.Schwering, pp. 90-91. One contemporary disparagingly described how the events came about: > \\"Prince Eitel Fritz, who is his father's favourite, being as tall as he is > brutal, and as ferocious as he is fat, took to himself a wife almost by > compulsion, and in order to put an end to ugly rumours that were flying > about Berlin concerning him and his strange propensities\\".Radziwill, p. 39. Marriage Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia in military uniform On 27 February 1906, Sophia Charlotte married Prince Eitel in Berlin. The wedding fell on the anniversary of the Emperor and Empress's silver wedding, which amplified the event considerably. The wedding had 1,500 guests, which included many members of Germany's royal families. Sophia Charlotte wore a four-yard long dress that was made of pearl white silk and embroidered with silver roses. The wedding had three ceremonies - the signing of the marriage contract under the statutes of the House of Hohenzollern on the first day, the administering of the civil law oaths on the second, and lastly the religious rites in the chapel of the castle later that day. She was warmly welcomed in Berlin.Radziwill, p. 39. Sophia Charlotte with her first husband Prince Eitel Friedrich, 1910 They had an unhappy marriage. Despite her warm Berlin welcome, Sophia Charlotte failed to make friends there. Eitel was also continually unfaithful. One source states that upon realizing what type of person she had married, Sophia Charlotte \\"withdrew into a kind of haughty reserve, from which she never emerged\\".Radziwill, pp. 39-40. They rarely saw each other during his time fighting in World War I.Le Queux, p. 11. It was a lonely time for Sophia Charlotte, and she resided mostly in Bellevue Castle in Berlin, where she spent her time mainly reading, painting, and socializing with a small number of friends. Plettenberg case testimony In 1922, Prince Eitel sued four German newspapers over what he considered libelous allegations that his wife had committed adultery. These events began when Sophia Charlotte was summoned as a witness in a divorce case, and apparently admitted to having an affair with the male defendant. In the case, she stated that she had known the defendant for a number of years before her marriage when he served her father in Oldenburg. When asked by the judge, she said \\"our intimate relations continued even after my marriage with the Kaiser's son\\". She also added that her husband was aware of the affair the entire time, and that her and Plettenberg's intimate relationship only ceased once he married. Sophia Charlotte later announced however, \\"I emphatically deny that either before or after have I had any unpermitted relations whatever with the plaintiff. I not only never committed adultery with the plaintiff nor did we ever kiss each other, nor did I maintain any relations whatsoever with him which overstepped the limits permitted by good society\\". The case was heavily suppressed in German newspapers, so that most reports were published in foreign newspapers. Divorce Sophia Charlotte and Eitel in 1925, the year before their divorce. They were divorced 20 October 1926. The couple had no children. It is believed that the couple had wanted to divorce before the war, but were prevented by Eitel's father. Eitel reportedly began divorce proceedings against Sophia Charlotte on 15 March 1919, citing infidelities before the war. In the end, a verdict given out by the court merely stated that Eitel was the guilty party. Later life After many rumors of potential husbands circulated after her divorce (including the aforementioned Baron von Plettenberg), Sophia Charlotte married in 1927 Harald van Hedemann, a former Potsdam police officer. He was forty and she was forty-eight. Despite his low status, the wedding was held at the grand ducal palace at Rastede Castle, and was attended by her father the ex-Grand Duke as well as a small number of both their relations. Sophia Charlotte was considered one of the richest women in the country, and the couple took up residence at the same castle where they were married. Sophia Charlotte died on 29 March 1964 in Westerstede. Personal traits and looks Sophia Charlotte was well-educated and was brought up with a quiet and unworldly upbringing. She was a good linguist and musician. She was also a talented water-colour painter. There were concerns of her well-being in Sophia Charlotte's youth, as her mother had suffered from ill health. By traveling to spa resorts and residing in warm weather however, she was able to overcome any signs of sickness. Once source stated right before her marriage that Sophia Charlotte had \\"developed into a thoroughly healthy and happy woman, whose fair hair and blue eyes, so entirely German, are somewhat piquantly associated with a delicacy of feature that suggests the Latin rather than the Teutonic origin\\". According to another account, Sophia Charlotte was considered slim and graceful with pale, regular features. Contemporaries state she inherited some of the good looks and charm of her mother. As she was the only child of the Grand Duke by his first wife, she was a great heiress. Her wealth was often stressed when mentioned in articles and newspapers. One book called her \\"pretty, rich, and supposed to be very clever\\". Another contemporary source however calls her plain and uninteresting.

The middle of three children to Harold Tovey, a builder, and his wife Gerty. His mother died of acute pneumonia when Geoffrey was a child. After his mother's death, he attended Wycliffe College school, then Bristol University. Career For a short while he worked as a GP in Bristol. He was then appointed House Physician at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, where he met his wife Margaret, a nurse. During the Second World War, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and was posted to the Army Blood Transfusion Service from 1941 to 1946, headed by haematologist Brigadier General L E H Whitby (from New Year 1945 as Brigadier General Sir Lionel Whitby) at Southmead Hospital, Bristol and helped in training RAMC privates at Clifton College as Blood Transfusion Orderlies (including J D R Thomas later famed for ion-selective electrodes that came to be used in blood electrolyte analysis - from 1994 Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at Cardiff University, whom Dr Tovey telephoned soon after being written to about his letter in The Daily Telegraph of 15 April 1998 on \\"New blood won't revive Service\\"); in 1945-46 Tovey had command of No.3 Base Transfusion Unit in Poona, India Command.

In 1959 he advocated the induction of birth at 36 weeks pregnancy to prevent stillbirth in babies affected by Rhesus Haemolytic Disease; this subsequently saved many lives. He performed early work on the typing of red cells and their antigens, white blood cells (Human Lymphocyte Antigens or HLAs), and the transfusion of platelets and later stem cells in the treatment of leukaemia. He collaborated with transplant surgeons such as Christiaan Barnard, Michael De Bakey and Sir Roy Calne. He also appeared as an expert witness in a paternity case involving Cary Grant. He was also secretly consulted when the Shah of Iran was dying of leukaemia. He was appointed by the World Health Organization to advise countries around the world on the development of safe blood stocks.

Founded in 1882 in the Kingdom of Italy, it is the monopolist intermediary between the authors of musical tracks and consumers, managing the economic aspects and the distribution of money from royalties of Italian-copyrighted music to authors and on their behalf. In the 2000s and 2010s, SIAE is known for the controversial decision to claim payment through the \\"Private Copy Siae Tax\\" for every blank CD, DVD, and HDD sold in Italy since 2001. From 2013 to February 2015, the main spokesperson of the SIAE organization was the songwriter Gino Paoli, who was the president of the society. Paoli resigned after he was investigated for tax evasion; Filippo Sugar was then appointed as a president. The current president is Mogol, famous Italian lyricist. History=Foundation and early years: 1882–2014 The SIAE was founded by a selfmade statute in Milan, Kingdom of Italy, on 23 April 1882. Among the first notably names to join the Corporation there were the Italian poet Giosuè Carducci (1835–1907) and the Italian musician Giuseppe Verdi (1813–1901). SIAE is ruled by the law Siae Copyright, no.633/1941 in 1941, emanated in Rome, Kingdom of Italy. Resignation of the President for tax evasion: February 2015 – March 2015 In February 2015, Police raided the residence of the President of the SIAE association Gino Paoli to probe an illicit two millions euro transfer to a Swiss bank in 2009 for tax evasion. Filippo Sugar SIAE President and his Conflict of interest: March 2015 After the dimission of the former SIAE President for tax evasion investigation, SIAE elected as new president Filippo Sugar. The new SIAE president said that SIAE isn't meant for grant equal rights for everyone, he is also the owner of the music label Sugar Music Spa EU's Law to terminate the SIAE money collecting monopoly: 2016 The European Parliament decided that the SIAE monopoly on the preventive taxation of the storage media, TVs and smartphones was to end by April 2016. Deposit at SIAE SIAE exercises the author's right on behalf of their legitimate owners. Authors' right has two distinct components: economic and moral. Italian law does not require a deposit since Berne Convention provides that the rights are first acquired upon creation of the work and therefore it is possible to prove the ownership by other means such as Copyzero. According to Article 180 bis, subscription is mandatory only for cable retransmission (not such a widespread technology in Italy), while broadcasting, both via radio and television, is not included. Subscription Authors can entrust the management of their work to SIAE both by association and mandate. Authors can address the Associates and Principals Service and the Public Relations Office through form n. 483. Associates have a right to run as candidates and to vote for the corporate bodies of the society, for the board of directors and for the supervisory committee. They have to pay an annual fee as opposed to Principals, who have to renew the copyright protection every four years and are allowed to subscribe to Music, Opera and DOR (theatre, radio and television works) Sections through form n. 489 and to Cinema and OLAF (visual arts and literary works) Sections through form n. 487. Non-EU authors, publishers and dealers are not allowed to become associates and therefore have to give mandate to SIAE in order to get legal protection for their works. Minors can subscribe for free through form n. 488. The mandate expires on 31 December of the author's eighteenth year. Pseudonyms and stage names Upon payment, associates are allowed to register their works under a pseudonym or a stage name. Though from an etymological perspective, there is not a big difference between pseudonyms and stage names, SIAE claims that pseudonyms are mere alternatives to birth names while a stage name is instantly recognizable to both fans and media. Protecting a work of art under a stage name is cheaper than protecting it under a pseudonym, but the authors need to supply the documentation (newspaper articles, websites, posters) proving that they're really famous under that specific name. Deposit of works In order to deposit their works, the authors need to deliver to the closest SIAE office an application form signed by all the authors and an unpublished copy of the work through a form called \\"modello 112\\", available in all SIAE offices in Italy. Associates can deposit musical works for free. When depositing audiovisual works, the case containing the work must be signed too. SIAE also requires the author to present the payment notification for the registration. Musical work registration In order to protect musical works, the creators need to be registered to SIAE. If the musical work arises from the creativity of a group of people, each member needs to be registered. If some of the members are not associated neither to SIAE nor to foreign institutions connected with SIAE, a \\"dichiarazione liberatoria form\\" for non-members is required in order to allow the rightholders to manage the work. In order to register a song, authors need to fill the work registration form (\\"modello 112\\"), also attaching the music score (at least the melody transcription) and lyrics. Needless to say, a full music score is easier to identify. For electronic or concrete music or, only in exceptional cases, chamber or symphonic music, that cannot be transcribed into readable notation, it is possible to deposit the recording. Members' names and their specific creative role must result from the score and from the registration form. The international confederation of Authors' Societies connected with SIAE enables the protection of works outside Italy. These societies collect revenues depending on their fees, detract their commission and hand over the remaining part to SIAE, which in turn distributes it between the rightholders (authors, record producers, performers). Phonogram production and SIAE According to copyright law, record companies use musical works for commercial purposes by recording, reproducing and selling them. Since SIAE acts as a mediator, record producers (who hold the economic rights according to article 72 of the Legge 22 Aprile 1941, n. 633, on the subject of \\"Copyright protection and other related rights\\"), must affix the SIAE sticker to the record and must deposit royalties to SIAE, which in turn is responsible for distributing them between authors and publishers of the work. If the company deals both with record production and musical publishing, it will be required to deposit royalties on one hand, while, on the other, will benefit from the same royalties as a SIAE associate (the publisher owns the copyright, by virtue of the contracts with the authors, and thus is one of the rightholders). SIAE and Creative Commons SIAE bans its associates from using Creative Commons Licenses. On 23 December 2008, a mixed legal working group, composed of both SIAE and Creative Commons Italia members was announced. The aim of the group was to allow the authors to choose free and easy-to-use licenses, keeping the commercial use to themselves, and relying on SIAE only for distribution and collection of revenues, but nothing came of it. The first example of Creative Commons license integrated with a copyright collecting agency was born in the Netherlands and paved the way to more flexible licenses, leaving authors free to use and advertise their works. This choice depended on the new frontiers of computer science, that allowed the authors to publish their works online, which would have been a sort of theft according to previous rules. The only solution for those who wanted to distribute their works online for free, was Creative Commons licence that was able to protect them from plagiarism for commercial purposes, thanks to its \\"non-commercial\\" clause. Thus the artist was able to take advantage of Internet speed to advertise his work, making profit from merchandising and live performances. Therefore, the artists are now able to release a work under a \\"non-commercial\\" Creative Commons licence in order to protect and distribute it and have the chance to make commercial use of it while Buma/Stemra, the Netherland equivalent of SIAE, is responsible for collecting and distributing the revenues. Results SIAE's financial results were subject matter for discussion. Over the past three years, as evidenced in the Reports of Management approved by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and by the Ministry of Culture, a positive trend for the net income has been registered. The result for the years 2013 to 2015 is positive: in detail 1.6 million Euros in 2013, 3.5 million euro in 2014 and to EUR 0.31 million in 2015 have been registered. Income=Preventive taxation Since 2001, SIAE collects a private copying levy, called Equo compenso (\\"Fair fee\\"), on media storage devices sold in Italy, assuming in advance that the user will store a private copy of copyright protected material. The preventive taxation is applied on photographic film, tape, VHSs, CDs, DVDs, HD DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, optical disc drives, hard disk drives, USB flash drives, memory cards, personal computers, set-top boxes, digital media players, mobile phones, etc. The total amount of revenues collected is estimated by Confindustria and Assinform (Italian Tassociation of information technology) at €300 million per year.Tassa su pc e telefonini per dare soldi alla SIAE from la RepubblicaEquo compenso. Equo? from L'espresso Despite this, SIAE declares that it is not fully satisfied with the amount currently established by the decree as it is not totally \\"fair\\". On 27 November 2013, the Italian Minister Massimo Bray (Beni Culturali) supported the decision to establish new taxes, with revenue going to the SIAE, for certain electronic goods, such as HDTVs and PVRs. This is controversial since there is no direct connection between paying the SIAE and purchasing a new HDTV or a PVR. On 15 December 2013, it's revealed that the SIAE organization had a hand in writing the new amendment to the law resulting in increased revenues of about €150,000,000 during 2014 from the tax on smart TVs, PVRs, hard disks, blank DVDs, CDs and smartphones (all goods that are sold without media content bundled, so the ratio legis is inconsistent). Taxation on non-lucrative events or activities SIAE may claim compensation for non-profit events. There have been several emblematic cases that raised criticism, for example payment requests to associations for singing traditional songs at impromptu parties, a payment request for the rental of the score of the Italian Republic's national anthem,Interrogazioni con richiesta di risposta scritta dei senatori Donatella Poretti e Marco Perduca nella seduta n. 367 del 28 aprile 2010 del Senato della Repubblica.L'Italia chiamò: liberate l'inno dalla SIAE da Sky TG24 del 5 maggio 2010. a request of a flat rate payment for photocopying tasks in university libraries.La tassa sulle fotocopie e il diritto allo studio from il Fatto Quotidiano of 22 September 2011. The claim of SIAE to request copyright compensation for educational activities has been discussed in the Italian Government by the Italian senator Mauro Bulgarelli, who proposed to extend the concept of \\"fair use\\" in Italy. Taxation on movie trailers In October 2011, the SIAE began requiring a license fee from websites hosting movie trailers,Tassa SIAE sui trailer dei film, sul web scatta la rivolta from la Repubblica of 29 October 2011.La SIAE e i trailer, che brutto film from l'Espresso of 10 November 2011 which had been considered \\"fair use\\" for promotional purposes. This license, starting at €1000 per year, would be required even if the trailer is embedded and resides on another site. This decision raised many doubts and criticism even by well-known directors and actorsPaolo Virzì: \\"Iniziativa più insensata che goffa\\" (fonte ASCA) Massimo Boldi: \\"Tassa ingiusta\\" (fonte ASCA) Luca Miniero: \\"A me sembra una follia\\" (fonte ASCA) Federica Lucisano: \\"Tassa ignobile\\" (fonte: ASCA) Enrico Vanzina: \\"Norma ingiusta\\" (fonte ASCA) and caused the withdrawal of the video content on some sites. Distribution All music songwriters and composers in Italy must send a mandate document to the SIAE or s/he must be an SIAE subscriber (registration fee is €129.59 and annual fees are €151.81). Authors who choose to register as associates can (with additional payment) register their works under a pseudonym or professional name. All CD Albums sold in Italy must have an adhesive label affixed directly on the CD jewel case. The mandatory fee paid to the SIAE, grants permission to musicians, bands and DJs to cover songs or play Italian copyrighted music.

The issue of the actual fairness of such a position has been repeatedly raised. Some institutions, such as the FIMI, ask for an amendment in favor of a more competitive market. Unequal redistribution of revenues The money the SIAE receives from the music royalties redistribution system is regulated by SIAE itself. A large part of the management rights for music tracks is entirely entrusted to the SIAE, which is also entrusted with safeguarding the interests of musicians. The phenomenon of a State granting exclusive intermediation activities to a single group that has been active since 1882, is currently happening only in Italy.

Biography A. Fred Bultman was the second child and only son of A. Fred and Pauline Bultman. His family was prominent in New Orleans, where his father owned a Catholic funeral company. By the age of thirteen he was interested in art, and worked with Morris Graves, who was a family friend.biography, Provincetown Artist Registry As a high school junior in 1935 Fritz went to study in Munich for two years,PAR and there boarded with Maria Hofmann, the wife of artist and teacher Hans Hofmann. After returning to the United States he studied with Hofmann in New York City and Provincetown, Massachusetts. Despite his father's wishes that he become an architect, with Hofmann's encouragement he decided instead to continue his study of art. In 1944 he bought a house in Provincetown, and thenceforth Bultman and his wife Jeanne divided their time between Cape Cod and New York City.Jeanne Bultman obituary, Provincetown Banner His early paintings have been described as \\"rough and painterly\\", an amalgam of symbolism and geometry. Bultman was exhibiting with other abstract expressionists by the late 1940s, and in 1950 was aligned with the group of New York School artists, nicknamed the \\"Irascibles\\" in an article in Life magazine,The Irascibles, retrieved January 17, 2010 Provincetown Banner who signed a letter to the Metropolitan Museum of Art protesting the institution's conservative policies. With the assistance of a grant from Italy he studied bronze casting in Florence in 1951; subsequently he was the sole abstract expressionist to fully integrate sculpture into his oeuvre. Affected by anxiety and depression, Bultman worked little between 1952 and 1956, and resumed painting and sculpting after undergoing Freudian analysis. At a time when African Americans were prohibited from visiting white museums in the south, in 1963 Bultman and his wife led a group of prominent New York artists and writers in the creation of a collection of modern art for Tougaloo College, a black institution in Jackson, Mississippi. Bultman was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1964-5 to work in Paris. In the 1960s Bultman began to make large collages, using pre-painted paper cut or torn and assembled into shapes reminiscent of his figurative drawings and more abstract sexual symbolism. In 1976 he started making stained glass windows with the aid of his wife. Bultman died of cancer in 1985. Assessment To Robert Motherwell, Bultman was \\"one of the most splendid, radiant and inspired painters of my generation.\\", and David Houston, curator of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans called him \\"an important artist from the South who was part of that great moment that changed the American cultural landscape.\\" It has been suggested that Bultman's career and subsequent reputation suffered from the vagaries of chance: he was not available for inclusion in the now iconic photo shoot for Life magazine that helped establish the reputations of the New York School painters;Naves, Mario.

History AVCOAT was used for the heat shield on NASA's Apollo command module. In its final form, this material was called AVCOAT 5026-39. Although AVCOAT was not used for the Space Shuttle orbiters, NASA is using the material for its next generation Orion spacecraft.NASA.gov - NASA Selects Material for Orion Spacecraft Heat Shield (April 7, 2009) The Avcoat to be used on Orion is reformulated to meet environmental legislation that has been passed since the end of Apollo.Flightglobal.com - NASA's Orion heat shield decision expected this month (Oct 3, 2009)Company Watch (Apr 12, 2009 ) Specifications *Material: epoxy phenol formaldehyde resin with special additives in a fiberglass honeycomb matrix. *Density: *Post-ablation char- layer composition: of carbon and of silica.  Notable AVCOAT Installations = AVCOAT for Orion Crew Module  The Orion Crew Module was first designed for the NASA's Constellation program, but later adapted the Space Launch System to replace the Space Shuttle program. This spacecraft was planned to take astronauts to the International Space Station in 2015 and to the moon in 2020. In the past, the honeycomb paste-like fiberglass material is gunned into each cells individually. On the other hand, the Orion heat shield is bonded onto the base of the heat shield. To protect the Crew Module during Earth re- entry, the dish shaped AVCOAT heat shield ablator system was selected. NASA announced that this module will encounter temperature as high as 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Licensed by Textron, AVCOAT material is produced at New Orleans's Michoud Assembly Facility by Lockheed Martin. This heat shield will be installed at the base of the crew module to provide a controlled erosion moving heat away from the crew module into the atmosphere. This process of erosion is called “ablation” - where materials are removed by vaporization or erosion by continuous contact with the supersonic velocity of gas flow and high temperature; thus the construction of honeycomb structure was made. Testing an AVCOAT specimen in an environmental chamber at NASA Langley John Kowal, Orion's thermal protections systems manager at Johnson Space Center, discussed the biggest challenge with AVCOAT has been reviving the technology for manufacturing with similar performance as demonstrated in the Apollo Missions. The EFT-1 mission performed two orbits of Earth providing the opportunity for Orion's systems to be tested. It took about four hours with the splash down in the ocean.  AVCOAT for Apollo Missions  AVCOAT was first used on the parts of the Apollo spacecraft orbiter and as a unit attached to the crew module in the past. It is a honeycomb structure. NASA confirmed that this is made of silica fibers with an epoxy novolac resin filled in a fiberglass-phenolic manufactured directly onto the heat shield. NASA's Apollo Flight Test Analysis, AVCOAT 5026-39/HC-G material was tested on the nose cap of a peacemaker vehicle. The temperature and ablation measurements were made at four locations on the nose cap. The report noted that the wear of the shield is due to the aerodynamic shear and heating rate. The report also noted that scientists believed that the ablation was done in a controlled manner. After the Apollo missions, the production was then put in place for the purpose of studying. Orion Chief Engineer requested the heat shield to be redesigned, however the final design was not selected.  AVCOAT Heat Shield Research and Installation for Orion Crew Module  The AVCOAT material heat shield went through several rounds of testing before being chosen for the installation. The Investigating the Thermochemical Response of Avcoat TPS from First Principles for Comparison with EFT-1 Data, things being tested on the heat-shield include: model gas transport, heat transfer, and TPS material regression. Orion's 16.5 feet AVCOAT heat shield was secured onto the Orion Crew Module using 68 bolts by Technicians at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. This heat shield is covered in titanium truss and a composite substitute with an addition skin made of carbon fiber layers. Orion's heat-shield was designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin. The heat shield is like pieces of a honeycomb puzzle that all must fit together perfectly and the bolt fittings must be lined up. After the heat-shield's installation, access to components of the crew module became difficult or no longer accessible.

It was first published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1922. The novel was adapted into an animated television series, Bannertail: The Story of Gray Squirrel, in 1979. Plot summary A baby squirrel is adopted by a farm cat after his mother is killed, but when he is half-grown the barn which is his home catches fire. He flees into the woods, where he learns to survive and make a new life. The author's aims From the Foreword: > \\"These are the ideas that I have aimed to set forth in this tale. 1st. That > although an animal is much helped by its mother's teaching, it owes still > more to the racial teaching, which is instinct, and can make a success of > life without its mother's guidance, if only it can live through the > dangerous time of infancy and early life. 2d. Animals often are tempted into > immorality—by which I mean, any habit or practice that would in its final > working, tend to destroy the race. Nature has rigorous ways of dealing with > such. 3d. Animals, like ourselves, must maintain ceaseless war against > insect parasites—or perish. 4th. In the nut forests of America, practically > every tree was planted by the Graysquirrel, or its kin. No squirrels, no > nut-trees.\\" Television adaptation Bannertail: The Story of Gray Squirrel was produced by Nippon Animation in 1979. There are 26 episodes.

It was developed by Hans Jacobs for the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS).  History  Series production of the Kranich (Crane) took place in the aircraft division of Karl Schweyer AG in Mannheim. The two-seater was, in its version 2, the most widely built two-seat glider in Germany from 1935 to 1939. Several hundred examples were built; exact numbers are not known. On 11 October 1940 Erich Klöckner in a Kranich achieved the record height in a glider of 11,460 m (37598 ft). Because it occurred in wartime, the altitude record was not recognized by the Allied occupying powers, and Klöckner only received official recognition by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) in the late 1990s.aerokurier magazine 1/1999: Erich Klöckners Vorstoß zur Tropopause, Motor Presse 1999 This record height was only exceeded ten years after the flight by the American Bill Ivans during a similar scientific program in the Sierra Nevada. In 1942 30 Kranichs were built by the Swedish manufacturer AB Flygplan in Norrköping, and delivered to the Swedish Air Force for training purposes. These machines were given the military designation Flygplan Se 103. Between 1950 and 1952 50 examples of a slightly modified copy of the Kranich II were built in Poland, known as the SZD-C Żuraw (żuraw is Kranich in Polish = \\"crane\\"). Between 1947-48 10 examples and until 1957, 17 more of a slightly modified copy of the Kranich II were built in Yugoslavia, they have also repaired two war trophy left by the Germans. They were known as the UTVA Ždral LIBIS Žerjav (ždral-žerjav is Kranich in Serbian and Slovenian = \\"crane\\"). After the war, Jacobs designed the Kranich III, a new development very different from its predecessors. It was developed and produced at the Focke- Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen. The first flight was on 1 May 1952, piloted by Hanna Reitsch. Thirty-seven were built.
