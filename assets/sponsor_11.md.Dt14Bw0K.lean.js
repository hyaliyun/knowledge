Both properties are in Edinburgh's Old Town.For various reasons the shop moved from specialising in silk to specialising in both silk and tartan.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1820 The Paterson of Romanes and Paterson does not appear as an independent householder until 1835, when \\"James Paterson of Romanes & Paterson\\" is living in a flat at 6 India Street.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1834 This places him as a son or younger brother of the silk mercer Richard Mercer who had a shop at 8 Hunter Square and lived at 3 East Register Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1819 The proximity of this to Romanes shop (less than 100m) can only mean the firms were rivals, and for some reason James Paterson chose to join Romanes rather than his only family's firm. In 1839 they presented a book of tartans to a local museum.http://www.tartansauthority.com/research/sources/romanes-and-patersons/ In 1842, on Queen Victoria's first visit to Edinburgh, the firm becomes by appointment to the Queen.https://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1842.html Paterson must be considered the junior partner, not only from his being second named, but also due to his lack of advancement. In 1850 he is still living in a flat at India Street, whereas Robert Romanes had moved out of the city by this time. Not until 1884 did the firm move from North Bridge to 62 Princes Street (their current home). This building originally dates from around 1780 but was remodelled in 1870 by Robert Reid Raeburn - giving it its current \\"gingerbread house\\" appearance. The original Romanes and Paterson shop disappeared in the 1890s.Buildings of Scotland, Edinburgh, by Gifford McWilliam and Walker Both silk and tartan went out of fashion around 1910 and the shop broadened its products in the 20th century, but now would mainly be seen as a \\"tourist shop\\", albeit a quality one.

Start of promotional career At 23, Frank moved to Chicago and worked as a bellboy for the Edgewater Beach Hotel. While working in Illinois, Frank owned a dry cleaners in Evanston, Illinois and had a night job as a theater set mover. For his musical career following his wife's persuasion, he became a booking agent for radio stars such as Fibber McGee and Molly, Gene Autry, and Amos 'n' Andy. This was for the WLS Roundup, where he was a show producer starting in 1928. Despite this, Frank still drove a dry-cleaning truck to supplement his income. By 1935, Frank quit both the radio and the dry cleaning job in Chicago, and moved his base of operations from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky where was now managing Autry prior to the star's move to Hollywood. Other acts that Frank managed while in Louisville included fiddler Clayton McMichen and Frankie More & His Log Cabin Boys. While managing Autry, Frank promoted the idea of the singing cowboy that would also include Pee Wee King, a future member of the Grand Ole Opry who was also Frank's son-in-law. It was while working with King, who was inducted into the Opry in 1937 that Frank began to work in country music, and eventually move his base of operations to Nashville by 1939. Move to Nashville and country promoter While promoting King on a tour in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1937, Frank befriended Roy Acuff. Using the same promotional techniques that admitted King into the Opry that year, Frank would get Acuff admitted into the Opry in 1938. Frank also suggested to Acuff to change his band's name from the Crazy Tennesseans to the nobler-sounding Smoky Mountain Boys. The success of inducting both Acuff and King into the Grand Ole Opry made Frank determined to promote Opry acts from small-town theaters and schools to big-city auditoriums within the United States. Frank also created the \\"package show\\" which described a touring country music stage show that featured several performers.Rumble, John (1998). \\"Package Shows\\". In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 403. The promotions were also used to change country music from its original name of \\"hillbilly\\", a term that Frank detested.Frank also assembled similar package shows for the Camel Caravan as part of offering free shows to the United States military both at home and in Central America. The early careers of both Eddy Arnold and Minnie Pearl were assisted greatly by Frank. Ernest Tubb also had his career helped through Frank's promotion. By this time of his career in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Frank would be known as the \\"Flo Ziegfeld of Country Music.\\" Frank would also lend a helping hand to many young musicians both in business and personal manners. This would even include and feeding budding country music stars at the Frank's house, which was also helped by his interest in vegetable gardening. Opry veteran Alton Delmore of The Delmore Brothers described Frank as \\"a clean-cut, neat fellow, with a little mustache, and a big Texas hat ... He always had his heart in his work, and he always had a good word for the down-and-out musician ... He was an excellent promoter and he knew just what he wanted and he always got it.\\" Songwriting activities Frank also wrote the songs \\"Chapel on the Hill\\", \\"Sundown and Sorrow\\" (cowrote with King.

They were not trained musicians, instead they deconstructed sounds and melodies. Gray performed at venues such as the Mudd Clubb and CBGB which were the epicenter of New York's underground scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The band also recorded music that was used in films, including The Radiant Child, Downtown 81, Blank City, Downtown Calling, and Basquiat. Since reviving Gray in 2011, original members Michael Holman and Nick Taylor have released an album and they perform live at art institutions.  History  On April 29, 1979, Michael Holman hosted the Canal Zone Party at Canal and Greenwich Street. The party was planned to showcase the graffiti of the Fabulous Five graffiti crew to the downtown scene. Jean-Michel Basquiat, then working under the pseudonym SAMO, showed up to the event to participate as a graffiti artist. He revealed his identity and asked Holman if he wanted to form a band. The band went by the names Test Pattern, Bad Fools, and Channel 9 before Basquiat named the band Gray after Gray's Anatomy, a book his mother gave hims as a child. Gray originally consisted of Basquiat, Holman, a friend of Basquiat's named Shannon Dawson (who would later go on to create Konk), and Wayne Clifford (also known as Justin Thyme). Dawson played trumpet, Clifford played a keyboard, Holman drums and Basquiat played clarinet, guitar, and the Wasp synthesizer. Holman recalled, \\"We played this angry, blaring, loud, confrontational music. Sometimes it was kind of mellow too, but it was very minimal.\\" Dawson's trumpet wasn't fitting in with the sounds they wanted to create, so he was replaced by Nick Taylor, who played guitar. Eventually Clifford introduced the band to his friend Vincent Gallo, and he joined them. Gray performed at nightclubs such as Max's Kansas City, CBGB, Hurrah and the Mudd Club. They described their music as \\"ignorant,\\" which was defined as \\"carelessly done or casually created work of art or sound or music that should not have worked but [actually] worked brilliantly.\\" Basquiat stated he was \\"inspired by John Cage at the time ‚Äì music that isn‚Äôt really music. We were trying to be incomplete, abrasive, oddly beautiful.\\" In June 1980, Basquiat participated in The Times Square Show and his career as a painter began to take off. In February 1981, he participated in the New York/New Wave exhibit at New York's MoMA PS1, and then in May 1981, he had his first solo show in Modena, Italy. After Gray performed at the Mudd Club in the summer of 1981, Basquiat left the band to focus on being an artist. After his departure, the band went their separate ways. Holman got into film, Taylor got into DJing, Clifford got into painting, and Gallo ventured into acting. The original Gray lineup never released a record, but their song \\"Drum Mode\\" appeared on the soundtrack of Edo Bertoglio's film Downtown 81, which was set in the downtown scene and starred Basquiat. Gray reunited in 1988 to perform at Basquiat's memorial service. They came together again for the 1996 film Basquiat, directed by Julian Schnabel. In the 1990s, Holman and Taylor created sonic music performances at clubs such as Club USA, Sybarite, Nuyorican Poets Cafe and The Ritz, where they opened for Todd Rundgren. Gray release their debut album, Shades Of... in 2011 on Plush Safe Records. Reviewing the 27-track album for GQ, writer Glenn O'Brien described it as \\"the soundtrack of a better world.\\" A remastered version of the album with additional remixes was released on Ubiquity Records in 2019. It features the work of producers such as: Todd Rundgren, Hank Shocklee, Deantoni Parks, Mike Tewz, and King Britt. Since re- launching Gray in 2011, Holman and Taylor have performed live for select appearances at art institutions, including the New Museum (2011), the Corcoran Gallery of Art (2012) the Parrish Art Museum (2012), and with Questlove at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (2012). They were scheduled to perform at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2020.  Discography = Albums  * 2011: Shades Of... (Plush Safe Records) * 2019: Shades Of...

The attack left at least 8 civilians dead, six French and two Nigeriens. The attack took place in Kour√©, a rural community in Tillab√©ri Region.  Background  Tillab√©ri Region, which is in the west of Niger and borders Mali and Burkina Faso, is largely unstable and has been used as a hideout by various Sahel jihadist groups including the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). Since 2018, these terrorist groups have spread throughout the Sahel region, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of military personnel and civilians in sporadic attacks. As a result of the attacks, the region has seen extensive developments in security, such as the construction of a new U.S. airbase. In an effort to combat the terrorists, the Nigerien government also restricted the use of motorcycles in January 2019. Despite this, parts of Tillaberi and Tahoua Regions remain under a state of emergency and the French government warns people against visiting vast areas of Niger.  Shooting  The shooting occurred around 11:30am (10:30 GMT) six kilometres (four miles) east of the town of Kour√©, Kollo Department, Tillab√©ri Region, where a wildlife park is located. The region is visited by tourists and purportedly hosts the last West African giraffes. Eight people were killed in the attack. The victims were identified as two Nigeriens, of whom one was the president of the guides at the park while the other was the driver of the group, both aged 50; the other six were French citizens, all of whom aid workers aged between 25 and 30.Attaque au Niger: qui sont les victimes ? So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

There was almost always a fire burning, sometimes left covered at night, because it was easier than relighting the fire. Background A sketch of a medieval cottage Historians have generally had low opinions of peasant houses describing them as \\"hardly more than crude huts\\" and \\"primitive...for the most part (houses) were small, with one or two rooms for people and animals alike.\\" Historians had long held the view that peasant houses were not built to last and would not last more than a generation but new evidence has proven this false and it is now accepted by historians and archaeologists that \\"later medieval houses survive in their thousands\\". The label \\"peasant\\" encompasses a wider range of social classes than previously thought. By the 15th century wealthier sub- classes of peasants were beginning to emerge under the manorial estates in the rural countryside of at least some parts of England, notably in the pastoral areas more than the heavily agrarian areas of the Midlands. The Wealden buildings in Kent are associated with a rising and prosperous group of yeomen. Smaller houses of cruck construction found the Midlands are believed to belong to peasants of more modest means. It is, however, usually not possible to link a specific home with a particular historic holding but some general observations may be possible like the house was part of a yardland farm. Legal instruments Few peasant landholders were free tenants. The norm for peasant homes was customary tenure or copyhold tenure, though the particulars of legal status were often not as important in practice as the agricultural resources made available by the land. Features Some common features of medieval peasant homes in Southern England were the open hall and the lack of a chimney or upper floor, evidenced by soot from the central hearth. Homes in Kent, Sussex and East Anglia share some interesting architectural traits observable in the roof structure, beam mouldings, crown posts and bracing patterns. Peasant houses in these areas tend to be of good quality, and scholars believe that they would have belonged to a relatively well to do peasant sub-class. Midland houses are simpler, usually cruck houses where the roof and walls are supported by paired timbers called \\"cruck blades\\", but also some box-frame houses (though fewer than other parts of England) and earlier aisled houses. Hearth and kitchen The hearth could be very simple, and cooking might be done on bakestones or pots arranged in various ways to use direct heat by placing them directly on the fire, or indirect heat by suspending them over the fire or placing them around the edge. By the second half of the 14th century branderths or iron grates are places over the fires in some parts of England, and pots placed on top of the grates, an early form of the modern cooking range. If a fuel other than wood, such as coal, was used the hearth would then have a more complex design. (Coal was the main fuel source in some areas like Derbyshire.) Even a small peasant kitchen was typically stocked with brass and earthenware pots and pans, brandreths, table linens, storage chests and vats. Larger holdings would have had more linens, basins, ewers and larger pots and pans. Pot lids for earthenware vessels were a simple medieval innovation that allowed more efficient use of fuel and more intense flavors to develop in the preparation of foods. Earthenware was used for boiling water, cooking vegetables, meat stews and to process dairy products. Brewing Most historical literature focuses on brewers who were licensed by the manorial courts, but in the peasant households of the rural countryside small scale brewing of ale was commonplace. Identification of peasant houses Researchers usually use established structural features attested to in substantial literary sources to rule out 16th or 17th century houses, thereby identifying houses of the medieval period by elimination.

Plot In an open space in front of houses built in Moorish style, overlooking palm trees and a body of water, a woman is dusting a painting of a sorcerer in a turban and long robes. Suddenly the sorcerer himself bursts through the painting and indulges in a variety of magic tricks, with the woman looking on and sometimes taking part. First the sorcerer makes an egg appear from her ear; then he makes it grow to enormous size, cuts it neatly in half, and combines the two half-shells with a palm tree and a pair of spectacles to make a giant weighing scale. Putting ingredients into the two half-shells and putting them back together, he cooks the egg over a fire and makes a flock of hens, and then two tiny children, appear from it. For a finale, he makes the woman herself burst from the egg. She takes a bow and exits, and the sorcerer puts one half-shell on his back and crawls happily away.

Also known as Star-Spangled Women for McGovern and simply Star- Spangled Women, the concert drew a near-capacity crowd at Madison Square Garden in New York City. With a dozen singing, dancing and spoken-word performances, rock journalist Lillian Roxon described the show as \\"one thunderbolt after another.\\" Bernstein reported that the event provided the McGovern campaign with $180,000. However, McGovern was not significantly helped by the concert; one week later he was defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Richard Nixon. Plannning Actress Shirley MacLaine had been campaigning so strongly for McGovern in 1972 that her agent threatened to quit, as she was turning down acting roles in films. She participated in several of the benefit concerts produced by her brother, Warren Beatty, including Four for McGovern in April and Together for McGovern in June. One of MacLaine's contacts at Madison Square Garden told her that the Republicans had forfeited a block of dates at the arena; they had failed to pay the advance deposit. With October 27 just 2¬Ω weeks away, MacLaine quickly paid for those same dates, reserving them as her own. She determined that she would mount a political variety show with women as featured performers. She began calling performers, and amassed a list of celebrity ushers such as writer Tina Sinatra whose famous father was campaigning for Nixon. MacLaine hoped that Carly Simon would sing but she eventually declined. Actress Marlo Thomas was eager to help McGovern even though Danny Thomas, her father, was a vocal Nixon supporter. MacLaine called Sid Bernstein to partner with her in producing the show. At this point, only ten days remained before the show date. MacLaine audio-taped an advertisement to play on radio to promote the event. Bernstein secured a 40-piece pit orchestra, and rehearsed the show with a full crew of technicians. Ticketron sold tickets ranging from $5 to $25; also available at the venue box office. MacLaine and Bernstein arranged lodging for the performers and famous guests, and they booked flights to return performers to their regular tour dates. To warm up her celebrity ushers, MacLaine hosted a pre-show cocktail party at Hotel Pennsylvania, across the street. She hustled them out in time for doors. Performance Shirley MacLaine conceived the show, co-produced it, performed at it, and served as emcee Some 19,000 people began pouring into Madison Square Garden when the doors opened at 7:30 pm. Famous people serving as ushers included Beatty, Helen Gahagan Douglas, James Earl Jones, Gloria Steinem and more. Goldie Hawn and Jack Nicholson had already served twice as ushers at Beatty's political concerts in April and June. Art student Charlie Finch, a volunteer usher, remembers seating Paul Newman and Bella Abzug, even though Abzug was herself an usher. MacLaine was the master of ceremonies, and she started the show promptly at 8 pm. She remarked about the coming together of so many women, \\"I'm going to write a book about all of this. It isn't going to be about politics, because that isn't what this is.\\" The first performance was a surprise appearance of Helen Reddy singing \\"I Am Woman\\". With the crowd still taking their seats, MacLaine introduced Dionne Warwicke who sang a handful of her Bacharach‚ÄìDavid hits and asked everyone to vote for McGovern. Marlo Thomas read a parody excerpt of Erich Segal's Love Story, ending with \\"Voting for George McGovern means never having to say you're sorry.\\" Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera headed a team of dancers interpreting numbers from Verdon's Sweet Charity and Rivera's West Side Story. They were joined by Cass Elliot to sing political parody lyrics over pop standards, one of them questioning Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger. Veteran actress Bette Davis sang \\"They're Either Too Young or Too Old\\", reprising her role in the 1943 film Thank Your Lucky Stars; she had difficulty reading the words from cue cards so she sang it twice. She also recited song lyrics by Yip Harburg, and received extended applause. Melina Mercouri led a troupe of dancers previewing songs from Lysistrata, a musical soon to open on Broadway. The dancers exited and Mercouri sang her famous song \\"Never on Sunday\\". Tina Turner and the Ikettes sang and danced their popular songs in their familiar revue style; music critic Don Beckman said she sounded \\"just as down‚Äêhome funky without [Ike Turner] as she ever had with him.\\" Mary Travers followed with a powerful rendition of \\"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\\", then she had the whole arena join in singing \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\". Judy Collins sang and recited poetry by Bertolt Brecht; she was backed by her band which included the only female supporting musician on stage that night, drummer Sue Evans. MacLaine sang and danced in a flashy Las Vegas style. Gospel singer Linda Hopkins brought the house to their feet, dancing along with \\"Do You Believe\\", also reported as \\"That's My Belief\\". Her appearance was a surprise, but her performance was so engaging that the audience responded with lengthy applause, demanding more, delaying Kennedy family matron Rose Kennedy. Kennedy spoke briefly about the election, then introduced Eleanor McGovern, the wife of the candidate. Eleanor said that McGovern-as-president would restore decency to the country. She said that the voice of the American people should be credited with forcing an end to the Vietnam War. After 3¬Ω hours of entertainment and politics, the evening concluded with a singalong of \\"America the Beautiful\\", led by Steinem, Kennedy, Travers and Turner. Warwicke was already at the airport by this time, on her way to Wichita for her next gig. Turner and the Ikettes left quickly, as they were flying to Boston for another Ike and Tina Revue date. George McGovern, 1972 Legacy Richard Nixon had been undermining McGovern's anti- war platform by announcing a withdrawal from the Vietnam War. McGovern said in October that Nixon/Kissinger maneuvering for a \\"negotiated settlement\\" with North Vietnam was a deceitful \\"ploy\\". On election night, MacLaine was in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with the McGovern entourage. She was eating dinner at a Mexican restaurant with consultant Bob Shrum and journalist Pete Hamill, thinking there was plenty of time, when they heard that the television news media was already calling victory for Nixon. With so many Americans wanting to believe him, Nixon had won the race in a landslide. Six weeks later, Nixon ordered the bombing of Hanoi ‚Äì an escalation of the war. Historian Jon Wiener said, \\"I remember election night, 1972, as like the worst night in American politics in my life. Here was this stark choice between war and peace, truth and lies, and the American people rushed to embrace war and lies.\\" MacLaine later estimated that she had spent $250,000 of her own money on the 1972 campaign, , paying for extensive travel, lodging, meals, parties, and innumerable organizational details. She also turned down offers of film work, significantly reducing her income that year.

It first flew late in 1931 with a engine but was later fitted with more powerful engines including a radial. Design and development The 1930s all metal, stressed skin Cairns A was unusual in a period when many light aircraft had wooden wing structures and most were fabric covered. Cairns had gained experience of metal aircraft structures when building the smaller, somewhat similar Cairns Clark Robinson Special in 1928. The Cairns A's construction details were sufficiently novel to attract the attention of the U.S. Navy Department and delay their release. In particular, the Naval Aircraft Factory Physical Laboratory undertook extensive tests of the monocoque fuselage. Construction apart, the Cairns A was a conventional cantilever low wing monoplane. The wings, trapezoidal in plan with only slight taper out to blunted tips, carried short ailerons. The first example flew in April 1930 and was powered by a Cairns G, a licence-built, four cylinder, Gipsy I air-cooled upright inline engine. Its engine determined its AG-4 sub- type designation. Cairns Aircraft intended to show that their fuselage could accept higher powers and this first prototype was later fitted with a radial engine of over twice the power of the Gipsy, a six cylinder, Curtiss Challenger, becoming the AC-6. The AW-5, with a lower-powered, five cylinder, Wright J-6 radial, was also tested but it is not known if it was a different airframe. Three were expected to be flying in January 1932 but photographic or other evidence is lacking for more than one. Behind the engine the Model A seated two in separate cockpits, with the passenger or pupil at about one- third chord and the pilot at the trailing edge. The cantilever, trapezoidal tailplane was mounted near mid-fuselage and bore straight-tapered elevators. The largely rounded vertical tail included an unbalanced rudder. The Model A's landing gear was fixed, with a track of . The legs were wing-mounted and enclosed in strongly-tapered, trouser type fairings, with the wheels in spats. There was a tailskid at the rear.

Grau. The book is translated from a study initially published by the Frunze Military Academy in 1991 titled \\"Combat Actions of Soviet Forces in the Republic of Afghanistan\\" and subtitled \\"A Thematic Collection of Tactical Examples.\\" Grau received the original Russian language text from the Department of the History of the Military Art at the Frunze academy. With their permission he translated, included commentary, and published his results as this book. Grau, Lester W. \\"The Other Side of the Mountain: Mujahideen Tactics in the Soviet-Afghan War\\". Quantico, Virginia. USMC Studies and Analysis Division. 1998. Pp XX (Preface).  Synopsis  \\"The Bear Went Over the Mountain\\" is a compilation of selected anecdotes written by Soviet field grade officers while serving as higher staff students at the Frunze Military Academy. The stories are based on their operational experiences during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War where they served as company grade officers. Many of the vignettes conclude with \\"Frunze Commentary\\" emphasizing the proper employment of Soviet tactics or how commanders developed innovative solutions rooted in Soviet strategy. Grau adds \\"Editor's Commentary\\" highlighting either the effectiveness of Soviet doctrine or potential hazards in Soviet military thinking. The book consists of 47 separate vignettes accompanied by maps and operational graphics, compiled into six chapters: A seventh chapter is titled \\"And in Conclusion..\\" in which the Frunze author declares Soviet combat experience in Afghanistan \\"...confirms the correctness of the basic tenets of our directive documents.\\" Grau includes an \\"Editor's Conclusion\\" which ends with: \\"The tactical lessons that the Soviets learned are not uniquely Soviet, but equally apply to other nations' forces caught in the middle of a civil war on inhospitable terrain.\\"  Title  The title alludes to the Russian \\"Bear\\" going \\"Over the Mountain\\" by invading Afghanistan, insinuating the invasion is a difficult or momentous task, which the war later proved to be for the Soviet Union. Also, Afghanistan is known as a particularly mountainous country because of the Hindu Kush mountains.  Reception  In a pre-9/11 review for the Marine Corps Gazette, US Marine Capt Robert C. Fulford found the book relevant to developing young leaders from a post-Cold War generation. He gleaned a sense of operational arrogance on behalf of the technologically sophisticated Soviets fighting what they perceived as a rudimentary insurgent Mujahideen. Fulford cautioned against hubris in his own force, which could lead to a similar fate for US Forces if not kept in check. Fulford, Robert C. \\"Lessons From Afghanistan\\", Marine Corps Gazette.

His research considers the development of mass spectrometry for the detection of disease. In 2017 he was awarded the American Chemical Society Arthur F. Findeis prize and in 2020 a Sloan Research Fellowship.  Early life and education  Badu-Tawiah is from rural Ghana. He was one of three graduates of a high school class of 500 that went on to attend university. He earned his bachelor's and master's degree at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. In 2005 he moved to the United States, where he joined the laboratory of R. Graham Cooks at Purdue University to study high-performance liquid chromatography. There he studied reactions in mass spectrometers, and started to investigate whether this unique environment could be used for synthesis. Whilst at Purdue, Badu-Tawiah was awarded several research fellowships, including the Andrews and Lilly Innovation Fellowships. In 2012 Badu-Tawiah joined Harvard University where he worked in the research laboratory of George M. Whitesides. There he developed paper-based systems capable of performing molecular recognition. In particular, Badu-Tawiah looked to develop macrofluidic platforms that could analyse for specific biomarkers. Unfortunately, the enzymes required to detect biomarkers on paper-based platforms are not stable and require careful storage.  Research and career  Badu-Tawiah was appointed Assistant Professor at the Ohio State University in 2014. His research considers new mass spectrometry techniques for the detection of disease. Mass spectrometry offers several advantages over macrofluidic platforms, as they remain stable. To achieve this he makes use of cleavable ionic probes that can be used to perform immunoassays. These probes can be attached to antibodies and mounted to a flexible substrate for screening without refrigeration. He made use of wax ink to trace out the outline of the channels of the device, forming a waterproof barrier that separates that safely captures and stores the blood sample. Badu-Tawiah has worked on devices that can allow the early-detection of malaria and Zika virus. In 2016 he demonstrated that these simple diagnostic tests were able to accurately diagnose whether someone was infected with malaria up to one month after blood was collected, and that patients could send them by mail to research labs. Alongside malaria diagnosis, the tests are capable of identifying the cancer antigens that are markers for cancers of the large intestine. Alongside disease detection, Badu-Tawiah works on novel analytical devices for photo- and electro-catalytic screening.

It is located on Junction 45 of the Motorway which also links into the A63 (into Leeds). It lies on the south side of the motorway, however, the junction affords access to, and from, all directions. History The M1/A1 link road between Leeds (now Junction 43 of the M1) and the A1(M) at Hook Moor, opened in February 1999. Although the slip roads were built in 1999, it was ten years before Junction 45 was opened to lead along a dual carriageway (designated the A63) westwards into Leeds. Extra submitted an application to build a service station in the area (known as Skelton Grange) in 2005, which was rejected by the government. A second set of amended plans were lodged with Leeds City Council in spring 2016, and permission for the site was granted in early 2017, with an interim bill of ¬£50 million. Morgan Sindall were appointed as builders and by 2018, the bill was estimated at ¬£60 million, with a projected opening date of summer 2019. Situated at junction 45 of the M1 motorway and the A63 road interchange, the site is east of Leeds and construction started in the summer of 2018. The ¬£64 million service station opened in March 2020 with just the general shop and fuelling station from the outset due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The station was billed as the greenest motorway service station in the United Kingdom, having a \\"living roof\\", access to the nature reserve at St Aidan's, and a viewing platform overlooking Skelton Lake. Skelton Lake covers , and is a remnant of opencast coaling operations in the area. The design of the station, particularly its roof, reflects the green corridor that site sits in. The site, which saw 400 jobs during the construction phase, and now employs 300 people, also has a 100-bedroom hotel. As the site is located off Junction 45 of the MI, it is accessible in both directions of the motorway and from the A63.

Originally created as a lighthearted way to call out similarities in designs, beginning in 2018 the account became a more serious voice in campaigning for integrity and accountability within the fashion industry. In addition to highlighting copied designs, Diet Prada has drawn attention to cultural appropriation and lack of diversity in publishing and fashion companies. , the account had two million followers.  History  Tony Liu and Lindsey Schuyler met when they worked together at the American accessories line Eugenia Kim. Liu was born in New York City and earned a fine arts degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. he ran a menswear brand called YOU AS. Schuyler grew up in Saint Augustine, Florida and was a designer for the eyewear company FGXI. The two would browse photographs of runway shows, noticing similarities between the pieces and older designs, and eventually created the Instagram account in 2014 \\"just for fun\\". They remained anonymous for the first three years of the account's existence, eventually revealing their identities in an October 2017 feature in The Fashion Law.  2018 Dolce & Gabbana fashion show  In November 2018, the account drew attention to a Dolce & Gabbana video advertisement promoting their major upcoming fashion show, called \\"The Great Show,\\" that was scheduled to occur in Shanghai. Featuring a Chinese model struggling to eat Italian foods with a pair of chopsticks, the advertisement was criticized as racist. Several hours before The Great Show was scheduled to begin, Diet Prada shared screenshots of direct messages alleged to be from Stefano Gabbana, in which he appeared to denigrate China and Chinese people. The post quickly went viral in China and the hashtag #boycottdolce began to trend. Hundreds of Chinese individuals scheduled to appear in the show withdrew, and the show was eventually canceled. Apologies were later posted to the Dolce & Gabbana account, and claims were made that both Gabbana's personal Instagram account and the brand account had been hacked. Diet Prada later described the incident in an interview with Fast Company as a moment when they realized they had the ability to effect major change within the fashion industry.  Monetization  Diet Prada earns much of its revenue through sales of merchandise. They also partner with brands and institutions such as museums who want them to cover fashion exhibits. They have done takeovers of Instagram accounts of other brands, such as Gucci.  Reaction  The Business of Fashion described Diet Prada in May 2018 as \\"the most feared Instagram account\\" for the repercussions that have been faced by brands it has criticized. Fast Company described Diet Prada in May 2019 as \\"one of the most influential voices in the fashion industry right now.\\" Diet Prada has been criticized for allegedly giving preferential treatment to brands with whom it has collaborated. Some brands and individuals who have been criticized by Diet Prada have described receiving angry and sometimes threatening comments from the account's followers for long periods of time. Diet Prada has been described as an example of \\"cancel culture.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:2014 establishments in the United States Category:Fashion industry Category:Instagram accounts ","title":"Diet Prada"},{"id":"64796027","text":"Shlomo Ginossar, (October 16, 1889, Odessa, Ukraine ‚Äì January 1, 1969, Tel Aviv) son of Ahad Ha'am was the chief Administrator at Hebrew University and was Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to Italy from 1959 until 1961.

Owens scored 18 points in the championship game against Montana (including the game-winner) and was named tournament MVP. The following season, Idaho returned the bulk of its perimeter attack with Owens and 1981 Big Sky Player of the Year Brian Kellerman, and added redshirt forward Gordon Herbert. The Vandals won their first 16 games of the season, including wins over four Pacific-10 Conference opponents. A highlight of the season was winning the Far West Classic by defeating Iowa State, Oregon State and Oregon with Owens leading the way, scoring 32 points in the championship game and taking home tournament MVP honors. The fast start helped the Vandals to #8 in the AP poll before falling to Montana on a last-second shot in January. This would be the only game that the Vandals would lose to a Big Sky opponent, and only one of two in the regular season. Owens again led the team to win the 1982 Big Sky Tournament while repeating as tournament MVP. Owens capped the regular season by winning Big Sky Player of the Year honors, averaging 14.5 points and 4.0 assists. The Vandals entered the 1982 NCAA Tournament as the number 3 seed in the West region and made it to the Sweet 16 before falling in a rematch to Oregon State. Owens has received several accolades for his college career. In 1988 he was named to the Big Sky Conference's all-time team, named for the league's 25th anniversary. In 2012, he was inducted into the University of Idaho's athletics Hall of Fame. Following the close of his college career, Owens was drafted in the fourth round (88th pick overall) of the 1982 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. However, he did not make the team. After a failed tryout with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, he signed with Athletes in Action Canada where he played exhibitions against a number of U.S. and Canadian colleges. In 1987, he turned to coaching, accepting an assistant coach position at Columbia Basin College, where he has remained for over 30 years.

Released in August 2020 on HBO, it chronicles the activities of three Republican congressmen: Matt Gaetz, Thomas Massie and Ken Buck who are outsiders to dominant party patronage system. The story takes place around late 2018 and 2019 in the lead up to the impeachment of President Trump. The film details how heavily the Republican and Democratic parties rely on lobbyists for financial support. It describes a system where those members of Congress who are most effective at fundraising for their party are rewarded with committee assignments. The film uses interview clips and narration from Lawrence Lessig to provide background information. Lessig explains climate change and the Constitution of the United States in its early American historical context. There are a number of passages that highlight the divisions in the media landscape and culture of the United States, including within political advertising. These include the conflict-driven nature of social media messaging and strategies employed by politicians and corporate interest groups.

He held multiple positions at the Library of Congress over 58 years of service, including director of the reference department, chief of the manuscript division, and Chair of American History. Mearns wrote the first authoritative book on the Library's collection of Lincoln's papers, along with twelve other books. Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish described Mearns as \\"the rarest treasure in the Library of Congress\\". Early life and education David Chambers Mearns was born December 31, 1899, in Washington, D.C. He was a student at St. Albans School beginning in 1914, graduating in 1916. Mearns attended George Washington University from 1916 to 1917 and the University of Virginia in 1918, but graduated from neither school. His only degree was the honorary Doctor of Letters degree he received from Lincoln College in 1960. Career at Library of Congress Mearns was hired at the Library of Congress in 1918, in a position sorting books in the library's cellar for a salary of $360 a year. From 1920 to 1943, he served in a number of increasingly responsible roles within the Library's Reading Room, including chief assistant of the Reading Rooms Division and Superintendent of Reading Rooms. In 1943, Mearns became the director of the Reference Department, the largest department in the Library. In this position and following administration positions, he gradually took on the role of the principal interpreter of the Library's history and services. He wrote The story up to now: the Library of Congress, 1800-1946 in 1947, providing a historical perspective on the institution. 1949 saw Mearns appointed to the role of assistant librarian, joining Luther H. Evans and Verner Clapp in the primary administrative roles of running the Library. He became chief of the Manuscript Division in 1951, the role he would keep until his retirement in 1967. He continued writing about the history of the Library, including Herbert Putnam, 1861-1955 : a memorial tribute in 1956. Under his direction, the Library began the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections program, providing cataloging for archival and manuscript collections in archives and historical societies across the United States. He was also instrumental in shepherding a program to process and microfilm the presidential papers collection. As assistant librarian for the American collections, he coordinated all acquisitions and services in the library relating to American history and civilization. After his retirement, he served as the Library as an honorary consultant in the humanities until 1976. Associate Librarian of Congress John C. Broderick wrote about his career: Lincoln research The papers of Abraham Lincoln were collected and organized by his son Robert Todd Lincoln, who deeded the collection to the Library of Congress in 1923. Mearns became interested in the Library's Lincoln collection while working in the reference room in the 1920s, and especially after seeing Robert Todd Lincoln at the Library. He began studying the collection as soon as they were available for study in 1947, and published the first authoritative report in 1948, with a foreword by Carl Sandburg. Mearns wrote, co-wrote, and contributed to several books about Lincoln throughout his career, including Largely Lincoln in 1961. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, First Lady Jackie Kennedy requested ceremonies similar to those rendered for Abraham Lincoln. Professor James I. Robertson Jr., director of the American Civil War Centennial Commission, contacted Mearns to research what those ceremonies had entailed. Using flashlights because the Library's timed lights would not operate after business hours, they retrieved issues of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper's Weekly, which gave elaborate details about Lincoln's funeral. This information was used to decorate the White House's East Room just as it had been a century before. Professional service and memberships Mearns was a part of the National Historical Publications Commission (now the National Archives and Records Administration's National Historical Publications and Records Commission) for thirteen years, representing the Library of Congress. He served on multiple other commissions, including several Civil War centennial commissions and the Lincoln Sesquicentennial Commission. He was elected as a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1966. Mearns was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Personal life and death Mearns was married twice. He married Mildred Sellars Haines in 1929, and they had one daughter together, Anne. Mildred passed away in 1945. He married Mary Hume Richardson in 1951; they were married until Mearns's death. He died in Alexandria, Virginia on May 21, 1981.

They have been held in various Polish cities and towns since 2001. Equality marches in Poland 2001-2019 Overview Equality Parade in Warsaw In 2007 (BƒÖczkowski v Poland), the 2005 ban on holding equality marches in Warsaw was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights. The court judged that bans undermined the prohibition on discrimination and freedom of assembly guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights.Chamber judgment: BƒÖczkowski and Others v. Poland Only a few marches were held until the late 2010s when the ruling Law and Justice party campaigned against LGBT rights. Since then, the rallies have spread to more conservative municipalities in Poland. In 2019, at least 25 marches were held, up from seven in 2017 and fifteen in 2018. Many right-wing politicians oppose the equality marches as a \\"threat to public morality\\" and an effort to \\"promote homosexuality\\". They often reference obscene scenes that have occurred at Berlin's Love Parades. Former president Lech Kaczy≈Ñski stated, \\"Gay people may protest as citizens but not as homosexuals\\". Adviser to the Polish prime minister Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski stated that equality marches are \\"a real threat to ... the Polish state\\". Neo-Nazi activists have held signs stating \\"Europa=Sodoma\\". Left-wing supporters of the marchers argue that they are a part of Europeanization and that freedom of assembly is a human right. Media reports on the marches often feature \\"ordinary people\\" who are disgusted by public displays and claim to have no issue with LGBT people as long as they remain hidden. One form of opposition is to organize \\"March for Life and the Family\\"; 130 of these were held in 2019. By city=Warsaw EuroPride 2010, held in Warsaw An equality march has been held in Warsaw since 2001, the first gay march in the former Communist bloc. In 2005, All-Polish Youth planned to hold a countermarch called \\"Normality Parade\\" (); instead, the equality march was cancelled by then-mayor Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, who argued that the event promoted a \\"homosexual lifestyle\\". In 2010, EuroPride was held in Warsaw for the first time in a formerly Communist country. Several thousand people attended, and anti-gay groups collected 50,000 signatures that the event should be cancelled. In 2019, around 47,000 people participated, including (for the first time) the mayor of Warsaw, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. It was the largest pride parade in central and Eastern Europe. Krak√≥w Krak√≥w Equality March, 19 May 2018 The equality march has been held in Krak√≥w since 2004. Before 2010, it was called a \\"tolerance march\\". In 2017, counter- demonstrators from All-Polish Youth directed participants towards a nearby psychiatric hospital, as if homosexuality is a disease. Pozna≈Ñ Equality march in Pozna≈Ñ, 6 July 2019 In Pozna≈Ñ, an equality march was held on 19 November 2005. The mayor attempted to ban it but was unsuccessful.  Katowice  The first Katowice Equality March took place in 2008. After a 10-year old hiatus, new equality marches took place in 2018 and 2019. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ The equality march in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was first held in 2011. In 2015, vice- mayor was present. In 2019, the march was sponsored for the first time by the city authorities, although the mayor, Hanna Zdanowska, was not present, the head of the city council , did attend. About 200 people participated and the marchers had to alter their route due to non-existent counter-demonstrations announced in advance by nationalist groups. Gda≈Ñsk The Tricity Equality March (for Gda≈Ñsk-Gdynia-Sopot) has been held in Gda≈Ñsk since 2015. Notably, the assassinated mayor Pawe≈Ç Adamowicz opened the 2017 march and his successor, Aleksandra Dulkiewicz, opened the 2019 march. Toru≈Ñ The equality march in Toru≈Ñ was first held in October 2017. Rzesz√≥w Marchers participating in the 2018 Rzesz√≥w equality march The equality march in Rzesz√≥w was the first to be held in Podkarpacie Voivodeship, on 30 June 2018. About 1,000 to 1,500 people participated, including the MP Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus and the actor Omar Sangare. Clashes with nationalist counter-demonstrators from All-Polish Youth occurred during the first march, but the police intervened to separate them. There were also pro-life counter-demonstrators. After activists announced plans to hold the rally again in 2019, Law and Justice councillors drafted a resolution to make Rzesz√≥w an \\"LGBT-free zone\\" and ban the event. Some 29 requests for counter-demonstrations reached city hall, which led mayor Tadeusz Ferenc, the opposition Democratic Left Alliance, to halt the march due to security concerns. The ban was overturned by a court ruling and proposed a resolution against \\"LGBT ideology\\" failed by two votes. Czƒôstochowa 2018 equality march in Czƒôstochowa, showing rainbow version of the Polish flag Equality march in Czƒôstochowa was first held in July 2018; the police intervened to prevent counter-demonstrators from blocking the route. Following the demonstration, prosecutors were notified that participants had displayed a version of the Polish flag in rainbow colors. However, they determined that no crime had been committed. Another march was held on 16 June 2019, attracting controversy due to the proximity of the Jasna G√≥ra Monastery. Lublin 2018 Equality March in Lublin An equality march was first held in Lublin in 2018. During the 2019 march, riot police used tear gas to disperse counter-demonstrators, some of whom attempted to throw eggs at pro-equality marchers; 25 people were arrested for attacking participants. No one was seriously harmed during the march, although organizers received death threats. A married couple arrested while protesting the march was sentenced to a year in jail each for bringing home-made explosives in their backpacks. Szczecin The equality march in Szczecin so far has been held in 2018 and 2019. Bia≈Çystok Bia≈Çystok Equality March was first held in 2019. More than 30 people were arrested in connection with a violent counter- demonstration.

Beginnings  The insurrection corresponded to the anarchist tactics of the CNT and the FAI, carrying out social agitations that denounced the very poor living conditions of the Spanish working class, situations that would produce the so-called \\"revolutionary contagion\\" in which the libertarian revolution would begin in Spain. In a regional plenary held by the CNT on December 1, 1932 in Madrid, the railway workers union requested support to declare a general strike in which wage increases would be demanded. In the end the railway workers backed down because more than half of their union sections thought that the strike would be a failure, but the Catalan Regional Defense Committee took up the idea at the proposal of Juan Garc√≠a Oliver, willing to put into practice \\"revolutionary gymnastics\\" which would consist of an \\"insurrectionary action\\" that would prevent the consolidation of the \\"Bourgeois Republic\\". The chosen date was January 8 of 1933. The insurrection began on January 1, when from seven in the afternoon to nine at night, several powerful pumps were blown up in La Felguera, (headquarters of the CNT in Asturias). Simultaneously, in Seville, there are street riots and shops and bars are robbed. In the town of Real de la Jara the agitators set fire to the local church. There was also looting in L√©rida, and clashes in Pedro Mu√±oz, where syndicalists took over the City Hall, proclaiming libertarian communism. On January 2, the Civil Guard of Barcelona discovered a bomb depot which they attributed to the CNT. On January 3, another arsenal of explosives was discovered in Barcelona. On the January 5, more artifacts exploded in La Felguera, and in Gij√≥n, and the strikes in Valencia by typographers, metallurgists and employees of the Electra company worsened.  Propagation  On January 8, members of the anarcho-syndicalist movement in Madrid tried to take over the barracks of Carabanchel, causing an exchange of fire with the civil guard. Acts of violence took place in Barcelona around the Arco del Teatro, where the union's headquarters were located. There were also shootings outside the Atarazanas barracks, where an assault guard fell dead, and a corporal was wounded. Three bombs exploded at the Madrid police headquarters. In Valencia, anarcho-syndicalist organizations added to the turmoil in much of the region. There was disorder throughout Valencia and in numerous towns in the province, such as Riba-roja d'Ebre, B√©tera, Benaguasil and Utiel. In Gestalgar several bombs explode. Anarchists took the town of Bugarra, after intense combat with law enforcement, with a balance of more than five dead and several wounded, and proclaimed libertarian communism. In Castell√≥n de la Plana the agitation began on the 10th. In Bugarra a civil guard and an assault guard died during the insurrection. When the Civil Guard retook the town, they killed 10 peasants and detained 250 more. The agitation spread to Zaragoza, Murcia, Oviedo and other provinces, reaching its greatest resonance in Andalusia, where numerous strikes were started. In Seville, cars and trams are set on fire, where the public force faces several shootings. In La Rinconada, libertarian communism is proclaimed. In Casas Viejas, anarcho-syndicalist peasants rose up proclaiming libertarian communism. In response, local law enforcement provoked a massacre of the town's residents, which becomes a great political scandal. The National Committee of the CNT, which had not called the strike, declared on January 10 that the insurrection had been ‚Äúof pure anarchist significance without the federal body having intervened in them‚Äù, although they did not condemn it, to fulfill ‚Äúa duty of solidarity and conscience‚Äù. But it was not the CNT's revolution that would be carried out ‚Äúwith guarantees‚Äù, ‚Äúin the light of day.‚Äù Solidaridad Obrera, the official newspaper of the CNT, stated that the revolt was \\"neither defeated nor humiliated\\" and blamed \\"the repressive... sectarian policy of the socialists who hold power and use it against the interests of the workers\\". The revolution \\"exists and will intensify for reasons of obvious injustice\\". For this reason, ‚Äúonce one insurrection has been defeated, another arises, a strike is resolved, another occurs; a riot calmed down, a greater one breaks out.‚Äù  Completion  In December 1933 the insurrectionary cycle ended with the insurrection in the small town of Bujalance, at the time one of the largest towns in the Province of C√≥rdoba, with an extraordinarily powerful CNT union, The \\"Harmony\\" Syndicate of Various Trades, which had more than 3,500 contributors in a city of 13,000 inhabitants. The armed insurrection of the militants of the Bujalance CNT acquired such a revolutionary depth that the republican government needed to move a section of the army to Bujalance from C√≥rdoba, in order to put an end to the revolutionary uprising and with it the insurrectionary period. Many workers died in the ensuing defense of the town. The subsequent repression was brutal; the Secretary General of the CNT of Bujalance, Milla and the Treasurer, Porcel, were both murdered in the so- called \\"Puentes de Ca√±ete\\" when the so-called \\"leakage law\\" was applied to them. Other CNT and FAI militants were given long sentences and were caught in prison by the military uprising and the start of the civil war. Much later in \\"El eco de los pasos\\" (1978) Juan Garc√≠a Oliver spoke of the scope of the January 1933 revolution, of which he considered himself the principle instigator, by qualifying it as ‚Äúone of the most serious battles between libertarians and the Spanish State... which determined that the Republican parties and the Socialist Party lost their influence over the majority of Spaniards‚Äù  See also  * Anarchist insurrection of Alt Llobregat * Anarchist insurrection of December 1933 * Spanish Revolution of 1936  References  Category:Revolutions in Spain Category:History of Asturias Category:1933 in Spain Category:20th-century revolutions Category:Conflicts in 1933 Category:Anarchism in Spain ","title":"Anarchist insurrection of January 1933"},{"id":"64796302","text":"Georges Mortehan (19 February 1883 ‚Äì 5 May 1955) was a Belgian colonial administrator. He served as Resident of Rwanda for four terms between 1919 and 1929, and then as commissioner of Costermansville Province in the Belgian Congo from 1933 to 1935. Early years Georges Marie Mortehan was born in Arlon on 19 February 1883, the son of Louis Edmond Mortehan and Marie Ad√©la√Øde Emma Hollenfeltz. He attended the Agronomic University of Gembloux and graduated as an agricultural engineer on 24 August 1907. His first jobs included chemist at the Zelzate sugar refinery, then supervisor of softwood plantation work round Arlon. He soon joined the service of the Congo Free State as a forest sub-controller, and left Belgium for the Congo on 13 August 1908 a few days before Parliament voted for annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Belgian Congo (1908‚Äì1916) In the Congo Mortehan began an internship at the Eala Botanical Garden. He was assigned to the Bangalas agricultural post in the Lualaba District on 5 March 1909. He was appointed cultivation manager 2nd class in July 1910 and left on leave on 23 August 1911. He left for the Congo again on 21 January 1912, and on 17 February 1912 was made head of the Yambata station. He was promoted to cultivation manager 1st class on 1 January 1913. On 9 March 1914 Mortehan became the manager of the Likini station. While at Yambata and Likini he collected a series of well- preserved herbaria, including some bryophytes and 1470 vascular plants. √âmile De Wildeman dedicated several species of tropical flora to him, including Daniellia mortehanii. Mortehan went on leave on 17 September 1914, but since Belgium had been occupied by Germany early in World War I (1914‚Äì1914), he was unable to return home. He began his third tour on 28 April 1915, once again assigned to the Bangalas post. His health failed, and on 7 April 1916 he returned to Europe (probably England) to recover. Rwanda (1917‚Äì1929) Mortehan left London on 20 December 1916 and traveled via Cape Town and Dar es Salaam to Usumbura, Burundi, which he reached on 26 February 1917. On 1 January 1917 he was promoted to provincial agronomist, and on 1 January 1918 to inspector of agriculture. Mortehan was one of the first Belgians to reach Rwanda after World War I (1914‚Äì1918). He arrived in 1919 and traveled throughout the country explaining agricultural techniques. He was interested in introducing new plants to serve an export market. He published his views in an article in the Bulletin Agricole du Congo Belge (1921). Mortehan returned on leave to Europe on 27 January 1920. He left for his fifth tour on 17 December 1920, again travelling via London, Cape Town, Dar es Salaam to Usumbura. He became Resident of Rwanda in 1920. In 1920 the rinderpest disease, which had spread from Uganda, was killing 60% of the cattle who were infected. The resident Van den Eede launched a compulsory vaccination program, but resistance from the notables meant the program was a failure. Mortehan, who succeeded Van den Eede, was forced to cancel the program, a victory for the Rwandan court. He was appointed district commissioner 2nd class on 1 January 1923. He left Usumbura on 16 December 1923 and embarked for Belgium in Boma on 26 January 1924. He returned to Africa for the sixth time on 19 February 1925, again via London and Dar es Salaam, this time accompanied by his wife, to resume his duties in Usumbura which he reached on 26 March 1925. Mortehan collaborated with Charles Voisin, vice governor of Rwanda-Urundi, on administrative reorganization until 1929. Monsignor L√©on-Paul Classe, Vicar Apostolic to Rwanda, wrote to Mortehan on 21 September 1927 proposing that the Bahutu would prefer to be given orders by the Batutsi, who were natural chiefs, than by uncouth persons, presumably Bahutu. In 1928 Mortehan prevented the Hutu and Twa from playing any role in the administration. The \\"Mortehan Reform\\" instituted a revolutionary change to Rwandan institutions, society and culture. The ancient royal administrative units, the \\"chefferies\\" and \\"sous- chefferies\\", were institutionalized, but the chiefs of pastures and chiefs af the army were removed, as was the power of the king to select or dismiss his chiefs. Hutu, Twa and Tutsi were removed from power and replaced by Tutsi aristocrats. This was a contributing factor in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. Mortehan was named district commissioner 1st class on 1 January 1926. He returned on leave via Mombasa on 18 September 1928. He left Marseilles on 14 February 1929 for Mombasa, and reach Usumbara on 3 March 1929. In January 1929 Governor Alfred Marzorati was replaced by Henri Postiaux. Shortly after Mortehan was replaced by H. Wilmin. On 1 April 1930 he was appointed commissioner general and assistant to the governor of Ruanda-Urundi. On his eighth tour he left Marseilles on 2 October 1931 and again traveled via Marseille and Mombasa. Kivu (1933‚Äì1935) On 30 October 1933 Mortehan was named provincial commissioner of Costermansville Province (Kivu). Mortehan was the first Commissioner of Costermansville Province (later Kivu Province) after it was formed from part of the old Orientale Province. He left Costermansville in 1935, succeeded by Joseph Noirot. On 15 September 1935 he was appointed State Inspector. He retired after thirty years of service on 13 April 1938. Mortehan was involved with Unatra (the state-owned river transport company in the Congo), the Rwanda Urundi Tin Mines Company (MINETAIN) and the Kilo-Moto gold mining company. He was a member of the Cercle Royal Africain et de l'Outre-Mer. Mortehan died in Etterbeek, Belgium, on 5 May 1955.

It was released on 20 July 2020.  Gameplay Blaseball centers on an absurdist simulation of baseball, with random events such as the \\"incineration\\" of players by \\"rogue umpires\\" with fictional team names such as the Kansas City Breath Mints and the Philly Pies. After the first log-in, the players can choose a team and are given some coins. The game allows the players to bet on the outcome of the simulated games by using an in-game currency. Each season lasts a week, and the players are able to follow what happens in real time. The matches are organized every day on the hour, while the post-season happens on a Saturday. Each team member has a name and a star rating, which is used to determine their stats. Users are able to use their in-game currency to vote on events and rule changes that will happen after each season.  Development Sam Rosenthal, the creative director of The Game Band, spent some time on Zoom calls during a quarantine caused by coronavirus with friends who don't usually play video games, but were still eager to play browser adaptations of board games. The idea of creating a title that would bring people together attracted the developers. At first, he thought to make a horse-racing gambling game, but the team decided that the whole concept was better suited for baseball. From 9 August 2020 to 24 August 2020, The Game Band put the game on a temporary hiatus, citing the problems associated with running into unexpected viral popularity.

Grau.  Background  The book was commissioned by the United States Marine Corps Studies and Analysis Division to complement Grau's previous book, \\"The Bear Went Over the Mountain.\\" Jalali and Grau had planned travel into Afghanistan in order to interview Mujahideen fighters in late 1996, but were forced to remain in Pakistan when a Taliban offensive campaign started to seize major portions of Afghanistan, eventually capturing Kabul on 27 September. Jalali interviewed approximately 40 Mujahideen during the month which the authors spent in Pakistan and an associate, Major Nasrullah Safi, conducted interviews inside Afghanistan for two months to collect additional data. Grau, Lester W. The Other Side of the Mountain: Mujahideen Tactics in the Soviet-Afghan War. Quantico, Virginia. USMC Studies and Analysis Division. 1998. Pp XX-XXI (Preface).  Synopsis  \\"The Other Side of the Mountain\\" is a compilation of selected anecdotes from Afghan Mujahideen recollecting their various combat actions against Soviet forces during the Soviet-Afghan War. The 92 vignettes along with accompanying maps including operational graphics are arranged chronologically and assembled topically, based on type of action, into 14 chapters. Each chapter opens with a brief summary and a simple map depicting the general locations of the vignettes inside Afghanistan. Soviet operational graphics were utilized in the detailed vignette maps, since the Afghan Army used them and many Mujahideen were familiar with them. The 15th chapter concludes the book by assessing the technology, command challenges, effects of decentralized command, professionalism, logistics, and tactics utilized by the Mujahideen.  Title  The title alludes to Lester Grau's previous book, \\"The Bear Went Over the Mountain,\\" which presented the Soviet-Afghan War solely from the Soviet perspective. This book focuses on the Mujahideen perspective, thus the \\"other side\\" of the mountain.  Reception  William C. Green declares that Jalali's and Grau's \\"highly readable compilation is a significant contribution to the literature on guerilla warfare\\" in a review for Naval War College Review. He is critical of the book's topical organization, states that the book is geographically biased, and claims that the \\"proofing and editing is distractingly bad.\\" Despite these shortcomings, Green still lauds its value as a compilation of first-hand accounts of a successful insurgency but urges revisions so that subsequent editions can better educate American military personnel operating in Afghanistan.

She was a large cruiser submarine displacing 2,135 tons that entered service in 1926 and served in the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. During the latter conflict she operated in support of the attack on Pearl Harbor, conducted anti-shipping patrols in the Indian Ocean, supported the Indian Ocean raid, and took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign , the Guadalcanal campaign, Operation Ke, and the New Guinea campaign before she was sunk in April 1944. Construction and commissioning Built by Kawasaki at Kobe, Japan, I-2 was laid down on 6 August 1923 with the name Submarine Cruiser No. 75. While she was on the building ways, she was renamed I-2 on 1 November 1924. She was launched on 23 February 1925 and was completed and commissioned on 24 July 1926. Service history=Early service Upon commissioning, I-2 was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, and she moved from Kobe to Yokosuka before the end of July 1926. On 1 August 1926, she and her sister ship were assigned to Submarine Division 7 in Submarine Squadron 2 in the 2nd Fleet. On 15 November 1929, I-2 was decommissioned and placed in reserve. While in reserve, she underwent modernization, in which her German- made diesel engines and entire battery installation were replaced. With the work completed, she was recommissioned on 15 November 1930. The German naval attach√© to Japan, Kapit√§n zur See Paul Wenneker, toured I-2 between 14:50 and 15:40 on 10 January 1935 while she was tied up at Yokosuka. On 1 October 1935 she again was decommissioned and placed in reserve to undergo reconstruction. While she was out of commission her American-made sonar was replaced by a sonar system manufactured in Japan and her conning tower was streamlined. After the reconstruction was complete, she was recommissioned on 1 December 1936. Second Sino-Japanese War On 7 July 1937 the first day of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 28 July 1937, I-2‚Ä≤s division, Submarine Division 7, was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet, and in September 1937 Submarine Squadron 1 was reassigned to the 3rd FleetBoyd and Yoshida, p. 54. which in turn was subordinated to the China Area Fleet for service in Chinese waters. The squadron, consisting of I-2, her division mate I-1, and the submarines , , , and , deployed to a base at Hong Kong with the submarine tenders and in September 1937. From Hong Kong, the submarines began operations in support of a Japanese blockade of China and patrols of China‚Ä≤s central and southern coast. From 21 to 23 August 1937, all six submarines of Submarine Squadron 1 operated in the East China Sea as distant cover for an operation in which the battleships , , , and and the light cruiser ferried troops from Tadotsu, Japan, to Shanghai, China. Submarine Squadron 1 was based at Hong Kong until the autumn of 1938. In an effort to reduce international tensions over the conflict in China, Japan withdrew its submarines from Chinese waters in December 1938. 1938‚Äì1941 By 15 December 1938, I-2 was serving as a training ship at the submarine school at Kure. On 20 November 1939, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve. While in reserve, she underwent a refit, during which impulse tanks were installed on her Type 15 torpedo tubes and her collapsible radio masts were removed and replaced with a very low frequency receiver. Meanwhile, her squadron, Submarine Squadron 2, was resubordinated to the 6th Fleet on 15 November 1940. After completion of her refit, she was recommissioned on 31 July 1941. She was based in the Yokosuka Naval District as a unit of Submarine Division 7 along with I-1 and I-3. On 10 November 1941, the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu, gathered the commanding officers of the fleet‚Ä≤s submarines together for a meeting aboard his flagship, the light cruiser , anchored in Saeki Bay, and briefed them on the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, which would bring Japan and the United States into World War II. As the Imperial Japanese Navy began to deploy for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, I-2 got underway from Yokosuka at 12:00 on 16 November 1941, bound for the Hawaiian Islands. By 1 December 1941, she was within of Oahu. World War IIFirst war patrol= On 7 December 1941, I-2 arrived in her patrol area in the Kauai Channel between Oahu and Kauai with orders to attack any ships which sortied from Pearl Harbor during or after the attack, which occurred that morning. On 27 December 1941, she received an order from the commander of Submarine Squadron 2 aboard the submarine to bombard the harbor at Kahului, Maui, on 30 December. I-2 arrived off Kahului during daylight hours on 30 December 1941 and conducted a periscope reconnaissance of the harbor, noting a small merchant ship moored at the pier. After dark, she surfaced and fired ten high-explosive rounds from her deck guns at the ship, but most fell short and some went wide in the direction of Pu ªunene. On 9 January 1942, I-2 was ordered to divert from her patrol and search for the United States Navy aircraft carrier , which the submarine had sighted. but she did not find Lexington. She arrived at Kwajalein in company with I-1 and I-3 on 22 January 1942. The three submarines departed Kwajalein on 24 January 1942 bound for Yokosuka, which I-2 reached on 1 February 1942. =Second war patrol= While I-2 was at Yokosuka, Submarine Squadron 2 ‚Äî consisting of I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-6, and I-7 ‚Äî was assigned to the Dutch East Indies Invasion Force. Accordingly, I-2 departed Yokosuka on 12 February 1942 bound for Palau, where she arrived on 16 February 1942 and refueled from the oiler , then got back underway on 17 February in company with I-3 bound for the Netherlands East Indies. The two submarines arrived at Staring Bay on the Southeast Peninsula of Celebes just southeast of Kendari on 22 February 1942, then put back to sea that same afternoon, heading for the Indian Ocean off the southwest coast of Australia, beginning I-2‚Ä≤s second war patrol. On 1 March 1942, I-2 was in the Indian Ocean south of Bali when she attacked two unidentified Allied steamships at 20:03 Greenwich Mean Time, claiming one of them sunk. At 00:58 on 2 March 1942, she unsuccessfully attacked another Allied steamer, probably the Dutch merchant ship . On 11 March 1942, I-2 sighted the British 4,360-ton armed cargo ship Chilka ‚Äî which was nearing the end of a voyage from Calcutta, India, to Padang, Sumatra ‚Äî in the Indian Ocean off western Sumatra south of Padang at . I-2 surfaced on Chilka‚Ä≤s port quarter and opened fire with both of her deck guns. Chilka fired back with her only gun, but over the next 25 minutes suffered 14 hits, which killed three officers, three lascars, and a gunner.. After I-2 knocked out Chilka‚Ä≤s gun, Chilka stopped her engines and surrendered. I-2 ceased fire and allowed Chilka‚Ä≤s survivors to abandon ship. Chilka sank at . I-2 concluded her patrol with her arrival at Penang in Japanese-occupied British Malaya on 14 March 1942. =Indian Ocean raid= Orders arrived from the headquarters of the Combined Fleet for all the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 except for I-1 to conduct reconnaissance operations along the coast of Ceylon and western coast of India in preparation for Operation C, the upcoming Indian Ocean raid by the aircraft carriers of the Combined Fleet‚Ä≤s Mobile Force. Accordingly, I-2 departed Penang at 12:00 on 22 March 1942 to reconnoiter Trincomalee on the coast of Ceylon. She arrived off Ceylon on 31 March 1942 and reached a point off Trincomalee Bay at 08:00 local time on 2 April 1942, but was unable to get any closer to the coast because of heavy patrolling by Allied patrol boats, sighting no enemy vessels except for the patrol boats. She transmitted her first weather report off Trincomalee on 3 April 1942. At 06:31 on 4 April 1942 she reported her activities since her arrival on station at 31 March 1942, noting that she had sighted no enemy aircraft since her arrival. The following day, carrier aircraft of the Mobile Force struck Colombo, Ceylon. On 7 April 1942 I-2 reported sinking an unidentified merchant ship at , and she transmitted another weather report on 9 April 1942. Later that day, Japanese carrier aircraft struck Trincomalee. Reassigned to the Advanced Force, I-2 departed her patrol area on 10 April 1942 and proceeded to Singapore, which she reached on 15 April 1942. =April‚ÄìMay 1942= I-2 got underway from Singapore on 21 April 1942 bound for Japan, where she arrived at Yokosuka on 1 May 1942 to undergo a refit. During the refit, shipyard workers replaced her 7.7-millimeter machine gun on her bridge with a 13.2-millimeter Type 3 machine gun, replaced her German-made Zeiss rangefinder with a Japanese-made Type 97 rangefinder, removed some of the armor protecting her torpedo storage compartment, and installed an automatic trim system aboard her. =Third war patrol= The Aleutian Islands campaign began on 3‚Äì4 June 1942 with a Japanese air raid on Dutch Harbor, Alaska, followed quickly by the unopposed Japanese occupation in the Aleutian Islands of Attu on 5 June and Kiska on 7 June 1942. On 11 June 1942, I-2 set out for Aleutian waters in company with I-1, I-3, I-6, and I-7 to begin her third war patrol. On 20 June 1942, I-1, I-2, and I-3 joined the \\"K\\" patrol line in the North Pacific Ocean between and . Refueling from the oiler on 24 June 1942, she remained on the patrol line until 3 July 1942. On 17 July 1942, she attacked an unidentified Soviet merchant ship with gunfire south of Dutch Harbor, but a U.S. Navy PBY Catalina flying boat drove her off. On 20 July 1942, she was reassigned to the Advance Force and ordered to return to Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka on 1 August 1942 and underwent repairs there. =Guadalcanal campaign= While I-2 was at Yokosuka, the Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. Assigned to operations around Guadalcanal, I-2 left Yokosuka on 8 September 1942 in company with I-1, I-3, I-4, and I-5, stopped at Truk from 15 to 17 September 1942, and proceeded to Shortland Island in the Shortland Islands. While she was at sea, she was reassigned along with I-1 and I-3 to the Outer South Seas Force in the 8th Fleet. On 26 September, I-2 reached Shortland Island, where the destroyers and had delivered four Daihatsu-class landing craft, each loaded with a Type 88 75-millimeter antiaircraft gun, an artillery tractor, and several Type 96 150-millimeter infantry mortars. The commanding officers of I-2 and I-3 took part in a staff conference to decide on a way of delivering the equipment to the Imperial Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal, and, after they made their plans, I-2 departed on a supply run to Guadalcanal with I-3 at 03:30 on 27 September 1942, with both submarines towing a Daihatsu. On 5 October 1942 she departed Shortland Island towing another Daihatsu to Guadalcanal, but was diverted en route to Bryce Island, where she arrived on 6 October at 05:00, unloaded the Daihatsu, and departed. She took part in a third supply run to Guadalcanal on 7 October 1942, and made a fourth run, towing a Daihatsu, on 9 October 1942. On 10 October 1942, I-2 was reassigned to the Advance Unit. After sunset on 11 October 1942, she arrived off Kamimbo Bay on the northwest coast of Guadalcanal and unloaded cargo, then proceeded to a patrol area west of Guadalcanal. She developed clutch problems, and her air conditioning system broke down, but she remained on patrol. Operating in Savo Strait on 12 October 1942 in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Cape Esperance, she sighted what she identified as an enemy cruiser ‚Äî possibly the destroyer rescuing survivors after the battle ‚Äî at 21:00 and attempted an attack, but could not get into a firing position. About west of Savo Island, she sighted an empty lifeboat and a drifting seaplane float. She returned to Truk on 3 November 1942, and her crew began makeshift repairs there assisted by crewmen from Urakami Maru and Hie Maru. I-2 was assigned to the \\"B\\" Patrol Unit on 15 November 1942. On 16 November, the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu, addressed a meeting of the commanding officers of his fleet‚Ä≤s submarines to inform them that the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, had ordered the 6th Fleet to organize a system of supply runs to the 17th Army forces fighting on Guadalcanal. Assigned to supply missions, I-2 departed Truk on 19 November 1942 bound for Rabaul, where she stopped from 22 to 24 November to pick up a Daihatsu, then proceeded to Shortland Island, which she reached on 25 November 1942. She departed on 27 November, towing the Daihatsu, and reached Kamimbo Bay on the coast of Guadalcanal on 29 November 1942. She unloaded the Daihatsu, then scuttled it because it had developed engine problems during the voyage. She then got underway for Shortland Island, which she reached on 2 December 1942. She embarked 17 passengers (a combination of antiaircraft gunners and midget submarine maintenance personnel from the seaplane tender ) and loaded 20 tons of food and ammunition and departed at 16:30 on 3 December 1942. She arrived at Kamimbo Bay after sunset on 5 December 1942, discharged her passengers and cargo, took aboard sick and wounded personnel from naval units on Guadalcanal, and got underway at 23:00, returning to Shortland Island on 7 December 1942. On 9 December 1942, she set out on her seventh supply run to Guadalcanal, but received orders on 11 December to halt her supply operations because of the loss of I-3 off Kamimbo Bay on 9 December 1942 while on a supply mission. She aborted her voyage and returned to Shortland Island, arriving there on 13 December 1942. After arriving, she became the temporary flagship of her division. After embarking the commander of Submarine Division 7, I-2 left Shortland Island on 14 December 1942 bound for Truk. At 13:21 that day, the submarine sighted I-2 on the surface off Shortland at in poor visibility amid numerous rain squalls, identifying her at a range of by a large Imperial Japanese Navy flag she was flying and by \\"I 2\\" painted on her conning tower. At 13:28, Wahoo fired three torpedoes at an estimated range of . Wahoo observed a hit forward of I-2‚Ä≤s conning tower, and two-and-a-half minutes later Wahoo‚Ä≤s sound operator reported hearing I-2 breaking up as she sank. However, I-2 was unscathed; she heard two large explosions ‚Äî apparently two of Wahoo‚Ä≤s torpedoes detonating prematurely ‚Äî and crash-dived, believing herself under attack by an aircraft. After submerging, I-2 heard a third explosion. I-2 continued her voyage to Truk, which she reached on 17 December 1942, but Wahoo received credit for sinking her until an Allied examination of Japanese records after World War II confirmed that I-2 had survived Wahoo‚Ä≤s attack. After almost a month‚Ä≤s stay at Truk, I-2 got back underway on 16 January 1943, stopped at Rabaul ‚Äî where she took aboard a Daihatsu ‚Äî from 16 to 20 January 1943, and then headed for Guadalcanal on her eighth supply run. She arrived off Kamimbo Bay on 26 January but, finding the area heavily patrolled by Allied aircraft and motor torpedo boats, did not attempt to deliver her cargo until the following day. She surfaced after sunset on 27 January 1943 and unloaded 15 tons of cargo before two motor torpedo boats sighted her and forced her to submerge. She headed back for Rabaul and was reassigned to the \\"A\\" Patrol Unit on 29 January while at sea. I-2 arrived at Rabaul on 31 January 1943. That day, the Japanese evacuation of Guadalcanal, Operation Ke, began. By the time it concluded on 9 February, 11,700 Japanese troops had been evacuated and the six-month Guadalcanal campaign finally came to an end. However, I-2 had one more mission to perform at Guadalcanal. Reassigned to \\"A\\" Patrol Unit on 7 February 1943, she departed Rabaul on 9 February, stopped briefly at Shortland Island on 11 February and departed the same day with I-1‚Ä≤s torpedo officer aboard and tasked to find and destroy the wreck of I-1, which had run aground and sunk at Kamimbo Bay on 29 January 1943 while in combat with two Royal New Zealand Navy minesweeper corvettes. After sunset on 13 February 1943, she penetrated Kamimbo Bay to a distance of only from shore but failed to find I-1‚Ä≤s wreck. On 15 February 1943 she tried again, reaching a point from the coast before motor torpedo boats attacked her with depth charges. After an aircraft also attacked her at 11:20, she gave up and proceeded to Shortland Island, which she reached on 18 February 1943. She got back underway the same day, called at Truk from 23 to 26 February 1943, and then continued on to Japan, where she arrived at Yokosuka on 5 March 1943 for repairs. =Return to the Aleutians= On 1 April 1943, Submarine Division 7 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet for service in the Aleutian Islands. The Japanese position in the Aleutians declined rapidly after the Battle of Attu began on 11 May 1943 with U.S. landings on Attu Island. On 21 May 1943, with the situation on Attu deterioriating ‚Äî ultimately the battle there ended on 30 May 1943 with the annihilation of the Japanese garrison ‚Äî the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decided to evacuate the isolated garrison on Kiska. The evacuation began via submarine on 26 May 1943, with the submarines carrying evacuated personnel to Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands. With her repairs complete, I-2 departed Yokosuka at 14:30 on 22 May 1943 bound for Paramushiro, which she reached at 04:07 on 27 May 1943. She departed Paramushiro at 0800 on 30 May 1943 with a cargo of 250 cases of ammunition. Arriving at Kiska at 22:20 on 3 June 1943, she unloaded her cargo, embarked 18 sailors and 24 other personnel, and got back underway at 00:55 on 4 June 1943 bound for Paramushiro. She reached Kataoka Bay at Paramushiro at 19:55 on 8 June 1943. She put back to sea at 14:00 on 11 June with a cargo of antiaircraft ammunition, mail, and six tons of food, beginning a far more eventful voyage to Kiska. On 16 June 1943, while proceeding north on the surface at in dense fog after losing her bearings, she nearly ran aground on Buldir Reef, and on 17 June, while she again was on the surface, a radar- equipped Allied surface warship surprised her and opened gunfire on her, scoring a hit in her port boat storage space which, fortunately for I-2, was a dud. I-2 crash-dived and finally escaped after being pursued for seven hours, also quickly controlling a leak that began in her engine room. She arrived at Kiska at 20:05 on 17 June, discharged her cargo, embarked 31 sailors and nine other passengers, and got back underway at 20:45. She made Kataoka Bay at Paramushiro on 22 June 1943. I-2 departed Paramushiro again at 16:00 on 29 June 1943 in company with the submarines and , tasked this time with supporting the Kiska evacuation by providing weather reports from an area north of Adak Island. While she was entering Amchitka Pass on 5 July 1943, an Allied surface ship detected her at 03:45 and pursued her for 18 hours, depth- charging her twice. She finally arrived in her patrol area on 10 July 1943 and transmitted her first weather report that day. On 13 July 1943, while she was on the surface recharging her batteries after sunset, an aircraft attacked her, but she submerged and suffered no damage. On 15 July 1943, with her weather-reporting duties completed, she departed the Adak area to commence her fourth war patrol. Notified on 22 July 1943 that U.S. Navy Task Group 16.21 had bombarded Kiska, I-2 attempted to intercept the task group; she sighted two green flares and her sound operator heard the screw noises of multiple ships, but dense fog prevented her from making visual contact with the task group‚Ä≤s ships, preventing her from attempting an attack. She arrived in the waters northeast of Amchitka on 24 July 1943, and on 25 July joined the submarine on the \\"D\\" patrol line. The Japanese completed the evacuation of Kiska on 28 July 1943, and at 20:25 that day I-2 received orders to bombard Amchitka Army Airfield near Constantine Harbor on Amchitka, but she failed to find the airfield because of heavy fog. Ordered at 2400 on 29 July 1943 to return to Paramushiro, she reached Kataoka Bay at Paramushiro on 4 August 1943. She departed on 6 August for Yokosuka, which she reached on 11 August 1943. While undergoing repairs at Yokosuka, I-2 suffered a mishap on 10 September 1943 when she collided with a breakwater in Yokosuka Bay at Yoshikura during a transfer, but she suffered only minor damage. After her repairs were complete, she got underway from Yokosuka on 9 October 1943, stopped at Paramushiro from 14 to 15 October 1943, and then set out on an anti-shipping patrol west of the Aleutian Islands. On 14 November 1943, she became the first Japanese submarine to use the Type 92 electric torpedo with magnetic exploder in combat, claiming an unidentified Allied transport torpedoed and sunk off Amchitka Pass. On 1 December 1943, she returned to Yokosuka for repairs, and probably for the installation of a radar detector as well. =New Guinea campaign= On 1 February 1944, I-2‚Ä≤s division, Submarine Division 7, was resubordinated directly to 6th Fleet headquarters. Assigned to support the supply of Japanese forces fighting on New Guinea and nearby islands in the New Guinea campaign, she departed Yokosuka on 10 March 1944 and arrived on 19 March 1944 at Truk, where Fuyo Maru and the submarine chaser escorted I-2 and the submarine into the lagoon. On 26 March 1944, I-2 departed for New Britain, where she arrived at Kimbe Bay on 2 April 1944, unloaded her cargo, and got back underway the same day. She arrived at Rabaul on 4 April 1944, then departed later that day bound for Truk, where she was scheduled to arrive by 11 April 1944. =Loss= I-2 was submerged in the Bismarck Sea west-northwest of New Hanover Island en route Truk when the destroyer detected her on sonar at 06:30 on 7 April 1944. At 06:45 Saufley dropped a pattern of nine depth charges, followed by another pattern of nine at 07:15. Saufley‚Ä≤s sound operator heard two underwater explosions after the second depth charge attack, and Saufley‚Ä≤s crew observed an oil slick on the surface at 07:23. It marked the end of I-2, which sank at with the loss of her entire crew of 111 men. On 4 May 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy officially declared I-2 to be presumed lost off New Ireland. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 June 1944. References=FootnotesBibliography *Boyd, Carl, and Akihiko Yoshida. The Japanese Submarine Force and World War II.

She was chairperson of the portfolio committee on public enterprises from 2009 to 2010. Early life and education Mabel Patronella Mentor was born on 19 October 1963 in the former Cape Province of South Africa. She matriculated from Batlhaping High School in Taung. She studied at Hebron Theological College, East Rand College, and the University of the Witwatersrand. Mentor also studied through UNISA. Parliamentary career Mentor was a long- standing member of the African National Congress. She was sworn in as an MP in 2002 and re-elected to her first full term in 2004. After the election, she was named chairperson of the party's caucus, succeeding Joyce Kgoali. She held the position until 2008, when Ncumisa Chwayita Kondlo was announced as her successor. Mentor was re-elected to a second term in 2009. The ANC designated her to be the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises. In 2010, she accompanied president Jacob Zuma on a state visit to China. This generated controversy. The ANC launched a probe and found that Transnet had paid for her trip.

Divisionsforeningen is one of two formal members of the Danish FA and is subject to the laws and regulations of the national association. The association's secretariat is located together with the offices of the Danish FA at Fodboldens Hus, DBU All√© 1 in Br√∏ndby. It is the organiser of the Danmarksturneringen i fodbold, the Danish Cup and the Danish Reserve League on behalf of the Danish FA, and responsible for negotiating the television rights for the three professional leagues and the national cup tournament. Originally founded on 2 February 1969 under the name Foreningen af 1. divisionsklubber under DBU as an association solely for the clubs in the top-flight league, it was renamed Foreningen af Fodbold Divisionsklubber i Danmark after the inclusion of the clubs in the second-tier in 1970 and third-tier in 1971. The Danish league organisation was the founder of the nordic Royal League, which was run in collaboration with the corresponding Swedish and Norwegian organisations, and had also previously organised the unofficial Danish indoor football championship, Divisionsturneringen and the Danish League Cup. The group was one of the 14 founding members of EUPPFL in 1997, and a founding member in the reorganisation to the European Leagues (EL) in 2005. An association agreement between Divisionsforeningen and Kvindedivisionsforeningen (KDF) was signed in February 2014 with the aim of strengthening mutual cooperation and the development of both men's and women's elite football clubs in mind. History At the initiative of Kj√∏benhavns BK, on 19 December 1968 the other eleven top-flight clubs were sent invitations to a briefing in Copenhagen on 19 January 1969 to discuss the formation of a league organisation, that could deal with the common issues surrounding the clubs such as salaries to the players and coaches, TV and radio charges, stadium fees, large events and national match days versus match days for clubs. Kj√∏benhavns BK had previously floated the idea of forming an advisory body consisting of clubs from the Copenhagen FA (KBU), but at that time it did not gain the necessary support. The organisation was formally founded at a meeting on 2 February 1969 at the offices of Kj√∏benhavns BK and was named Foreningen af 1. divisionsklubber under DBU. As indicated by its name, the members of the organisation were 14 clubs: the 12 clubs that partook in the 1969 Danish 1st Division and the previous season's two relegated clubs. The then chairman of BK Frem, Svend Petersen, was selected as the new association's first chairman, vice chairman of Kj√∏benhavns BK, B√∏rge Pockendahl, was choosen as vice chairman, Sonny Thomsen of Aalborg BK became the treasurer, while the rest of the board included Ejvind S√∏rensen (chairman of B 1909) and Svend Erik Bang S√∏rensen (Aarhus GF). The organisation was not seem as a protest against the Danish FA (DBU) and the organisation of regional football associations (LFU). The association's first board meeting took place in Aalborg on 4 April 1969, and resulted in common ground on the aspect of identical entrance fees at half price at top-flight league matches for children and old-age and invalidity pensioners across the entire country ‚Äì the clubs in the 2nd and 3rd divisions received a recommendation from the association to introduce the same scheme. The initiative was welcomed by the Danish FA, who offered to provide the administration. It was also decided to investigate the possibility of taking out a collective accident insurance for the clubs' 25 best players ‚Äì insurance of all players in the 14 clubs was deemed as not being financially feasible. A condemnation of the Danmarks Idr√¶tsforbund's TV committee for allowing a TV broadcast from the 1969 Ice Hockey World Championships at the same time as the premiere of the Danmarksturneringen, discussion of contracts for advertising on training shirts, attention to unpaid exploitation of players in an advertising context, discussion about disbursing money to players, the issue of standard contracts and identical salaries for professional coaches, and establishing a cooperation with the corresponding Swedish association, was also on the agenda at the meeting. Two board members stated that the new association would be working towards making the game of football in Denmark more attractive, including providing entertainment at matches with the goal of attracting more spectators. At the formation of the league organisation, it was decided to not initially include the clubs in the 2nd of 3rd divisions. The clubs in the 2nd divisions became members in 1970, while the clubs in the 3rd division became members in 1971. Clubs that were relegated to the fourth division would lose their membership. Since 1999, Divisionsforeningen have entered into collective agreements with the Danish Football Players' Association.

It is commonly referred to as tiny bristle fern. The specific epithet 'minutus' means small in latin, referring to the small fronds Description C. minutum growing in Japan Crepidomanes minutum is a small fern which grows epipetricly or epiphytically. It tends to grow in moist, low elevation forests where moisture is abundant and can tolerate deep shade. It has long-creeping rhizomes from which its leaves arise. The rhizome does not have roots but instead has rhizoids. Its leaves range from 1.5cm long to 6cm, and are flabellate to 1-4 times pinnate but may also be palmately lobed in some individuals. Leaves also have buds which allow individual leaves to proliferate and branch. It looks much like a moss and may be confused as one without careful examination. The sori are located in involvucures at the tips of the lobes of the leaves and are somewhat cup-shaped. It can also reproduce apogamously like many other ferns. Taxonomy The species was first described as Trichomanes minutum by Carl Ludwig Blume in 1828 but has since been moved to Crepidomanes minutum based on genetic evidence. C. minutum has great variation in morphology between different populations, thus has extensive synonymy as many of these populations were described as separate species. Further research, however, has revealed that the variation within the species is continuous and all variation is best regarded as intraspecific rather than interspecific variation. Crepidomanes minutum may be diploid, triploid, or tetrapoid. It has a very complex evolutionary history consisting of multiple sub-lineages which have been observed to interbreed. The relationships of individual populations of C. minutum are best described by reticulate evolution. Range Crepidomanes minutum has a broad distribution throughout the Pacific in areas including but not limited to Australia, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Equatorial Guinea, Hawaii, India, Indonesia, Japan, Java, Korea, Malaysia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Nepal, Philippines, Polynesia, Russia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Soon the entire battalion was in the town, where it spent the year of 1791.  Revolution  On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 6√©me Bataillon de Chassers (Bretons), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792. In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, yellow turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, yellow trimmed dark green pockets, yellow trimmed dark green cuffs, yellow cuff flaps, and white buttons. In the beginning of 1792, the regiment was directed towards Strasbourg where it was to join the vanguard of the Army of the Rhine Arm√©e du Rhin. The regiment had the distinction of being the first to attack the Prussian entrenchments on the heights of the Chapelle Sainte-Anne, and charged with bayonets at the ready and pushed the majority of the opposing force out of the entire area.

Haines was a founder and first president of the Philadelphia Hose Company, the first organization in the United States devoted to fighting fires by pumping water through a leather hose. Haines served as the corresponding secretary of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for 17 years (1814‚Äì1831) and made significant early contributions to the museum collection. He was the first person to import Alderney cattle (a now extinct breed closely related to Guernsey cattle) into the United States. He was the proprietor of the historic Wyck House in Germantown, Pennsylvania.  Biography = Family  Haines was born into a wealthy Quaker family with an extensive social network. He was the son of Caspar Wistar Haines (1762‚Äì1801) and Hannah (Marshall) Haines (1765‚Äì1828); great-grandson of Caspar Wistar (1696‚Äì1752), the glass maker; and grandson of Reuben Haines (1727‚Äì1793), the brewer and land prospector. Timothy Matlack the brewer-politician was his uncle. Haines was the heir of a family homestead in Germantown that had been passed down since 1692 on his father‚Äôs side, now known as the Wyck House. It was founded by his ancestor, Hans Milan, an early settler of Germantown, who immigrated to the Pennsylvania colony from Holland or lower Rhineland. Haines married Jane Bowne in New York on May 12, 1812. They would have nine children: * Sarah Minturn Haines (b. March 30, 1812) * Margaret Haines * Elizabeth Bowne Haines (1817‚Äì1891) * John Smith Haines (1820‚Äì1850) * Hannah Haines (1822‚Äì1882) * Sarah Haines, who died in childbirth * Robert Bowne (1827‚Äì1895) * Margaret \\"Meta\\" Haines (1830‚Äì1878) * Jane Reuben Haines (1832‚Äì1911), both after her father's death, master of Wyck until 1911.  Residences  Haines spent a portion of his childhood at the Wyck House in Germantown, which in 1971 was designated as a National Historic Landmark. To escape the yellow fever epidemic that took the life of his grandparents and devastated Philadelphia in 1793, the Haines family relocated to their ancestral property in Germantown by 1794. Haines lived at Wyck from 1794 to 1797, during which time he helped his father construct a stone barn (1795/96) on the Wyck property, and the Germantown Brewery on the lot adjacent to Wyck, which would remain in business from 1795 to the 1840s. Haines lived at boarding school from 1797 until his father's death in 1801, after which he moved back to Germantown. Several months later, he and his mother Hannah moved to Philadelphia, where they lived together in a house on New Bank St. until Reuben married in 1812. Haines and his new bride then moved into a new townhouse at 300 Chestnut St., which became an occasional venue for the famous \\"Wistar Parties\\", which were regular gatherings of intellectuals (most associated with the American Philosophical Society) organized by his cousin, the eminent physician Dr. Caspar Wistar. From 1814 to 1820, Haines and his young family went to Wyck for the summer seasons, and then in 1820 relocated there permanently. A diary entry by Haines dated \\"6 mo. 1, 1820\\" (June 1) reads: \\"waggon & 2 carts to Philada. to bring R. H. Goods. R. Haines left Philada. & moved to Germantown.\\"  Education and early adulthood  Haines attended boarding school in Burlington, New Jersey, from January 1797 to April 1798; after which, he moved in with his uncle, Richard Hartshorne, in Philadelphia. He attended Fourth St. Friends School from December 1798 to March 1799. Haines was enrolled in the inaugural class at Westtown School, a private Quaker boarding school in Chester County, Pennsylvania. This is presumably where Haines began his friendship with Thomas Say, the zoologist and explorer, who was his classmate, and where he was introduced to a wide array of scientific topics including astronomy and natural history. Haines spent only three years at Westtown before leaving prematurely after his father's death. After his father's death, Haines entered into an apprenticeship in a dry goods store in Philadelphia, owned by his uncles Christopher Marshall and Abraham Garrigues, where he worked until 1809. During this time, Haines took classes at the University of Pennsylvania from Benjamin Smith Barton (ornithology and botany), Thomas Cooper (chemistry), and Benjamin Rush (medicine). In 1809, he decided that his \\"whole attention should be engrossed ... in the pursuit of knowledge [and] the society of genuine friends\\", and thereafter lived off his inherited wealth, which included real estate in Philadelphia and rural Pennsylvania, the Germantown Brewery, and interest-paying bonds and loans.  Philadelphia Hose Company  Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) Museum, 12th and Sansom Sts., Philadelphia. Haines attended meetings at this (now demolished) building from 1826 until his death in 1831. The ANSP vacated the building in 1840.Haines hosted the first meeting of the company at his home (No. 4 Bank St., Philadelphia) on December 15, 1803. At the time, he was working as a clerk in the store of his uncle, the merchant Abraham Garrigues (husband of his mother's sister).  Philanthropic activities  Haines invested his wealth in building projects in Philadelphia and elsewhere, including the Fairmount Water Works (constructed 1812-1815) and the Lancaster Turnpike.  Participation in Scientific Societies  Haines was elected to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia on November 16, 1813. He became corresponding secretary in 1814, after the previous secretary, Camillus M. Mann, neglected his duties. In this role, and through his contacts in the Quaker community, Haines engaged with a large network of scientists in North America and abroad. In New York, his contacts included Samuel L. Mitchill and DeWitt Clinton, who soon organized a similar society called the New York Lyceum of Natural History, now known as the New York Academy of Sciences. Although Haines did not publish his own work, he participated in peer review with other Academy members. He was on the committee that gave a favorable review to Thomas Nuttall's description of the golden selenia (Selenia aurea) and clasping jewelflower (Streptanthus maculatus), type species of the genus Streptanthus.Archives of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, coll. 292. Publications committee papers. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Prior to his involvement at the Academy, he had served as volunteer librarian at the Friends' Library in 1809‚Äì1810. Haines was one of three Academy members who nominated John James Audubon for membership in 1824; the others were Charles Alexandre Lesueur and Isaiah Lukens, the clockmaker. Audubon was rejected on suspicion of scientific misconduct. Five letters from Audubon to Haines are extant.  Herpetology / Ichthyology / Paleontology  Haines discovered one of the two syntypes of the Queen snake (Regina septemvittata), on the second floor of his home (Wyck House), which was described by Say in 1825. Haines collected the type specimen of Catostomus vittatus, an American fish described by Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1817. Lesueur wrote: \\"This remarkable little species was found in Wissahickon creek, near Philadelphia, by Reuben Haines\\". The holotype of Baculites ovatus, described by Say in 1820 and later illustrated by Samuel G. Morton, was in Haines's collection. It was lost for more than 180 years after his death until 2017, when it was rediscovered at the Wyck House. The home of Reuben Haines III: the historic Wyck House in Germantown, Philadelphia. Photo taken in 2009.  Ornithology  Haines studied ornithology under Benjamin Smith Barton and is the first known person to successfully breed Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) in captivity in Pennsylvania. Between 1818‚Äì1828, numerous influential ornithologists visited Wyck to see the geese including George Ord, Thomas Nuttall, Charles Alexandre Lesueur and John James Audubon. A note in his expense ledger dated April 9, 1824, reads [sic]: \\"Charles J. Wistar, Thos. Say & Charles Bonaparte (Prince of Canneno) son of [...] dined with me at Germantown after an ornithological excursion.\\"  Educational Reform  Haines was the first life-member of the American Institute of Instruction, where he also served as vice president. He was a supporter of the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in the United States, and the education of African American youth. A letter dated July 1, 1831, written by James Ronaldson and addressed to Haines, reads: \\"I am well acquainted with the deep interest each of you takes in, not only the promoting of emancipation of the Africans, but also, your anxiety that these people should advance in intellectual knowledge and social respectability.\\" Haines was one of the founding directors of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, established in 1821, now known as the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. From 1821-1824, Haines enrolled his daughter Sarah in a school based on the eductional philosophy of Johann Pestalozzi, operated by Madame Fretageot. Just prior to his death in 1831, Haines had hired Amos Bronson Alcott to teach at a new school in Germantown, and their two families shared a close bond of friendship.  Death  Haines died unexpectedly on the evening of October 19, 1831, evidently from an overdose of laudanum. He was buried in a family plot at the cemetery of the Germantown Friends' Meeting House, at the corner of Germantown Ave. and Coulter St., Philadelphia. A handwritten eulogy that was presumably read at his funeral survives among the family papers: > \\"When Reuben Haines joined [the Academy of Natural Sciences of > Philadelphia], it was composed of a few members & was just struggling into > existence. He brought to it indeed no peculiar stores of scientific > knowledge & yet, to no one, except its munificent President [William > Maclure], is the Academy more indebted for its present prosperous condition, > than to our lamented friend.\\"  Publications  Haines, R. 1824.

During the caliphate of his relative Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik () he served as a governor of Egypt (724‚Äì727) and was afterwards placed in charge of Mosul, where he remained until his death. He is known for having undertaken a number of large-scale building projects in Mosul, including some of the city's most significant developments completed during the Marwanid period. Career=Family Al-Hurr was descended from a collateral branch of the Umayyad dynasty, his grandfather Yahya ibn al-Hakam having been the brother of the fourth Umayyad caliph Marwan ibn al-Hakam (). His father, Yusuf, had served as a governor of Mosul during the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (). One of al-Hurr's aunts, Amina bint Yahya, was married to Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, while another aunt (or, according to the historian al-Azdi, sister), Umm Hakim,On Umm Hakim see , . was similarly wed to the same caliph and later proved instrumental in procuring al-Hurr's appointment to Mosul.; . Among al-Hurr's children, Yahya ibn al-Hurr briefly served as acting governor of Mosul following his father's death and remained in ownership of properties in the region until he was executed by Isma'il ibn Ali in the aftermath of the Abbasid Revolution. Another son, Ubaydallah, reportedly joined Abdallah ibn Marwan ibn Muhammad in fleeing to Nubia after the death of the last Umayyad caliph Marwan II in 750. Salama ibn al-Hurr became a poet and took up residence among the Bedouins in the Arabian desert; he was later killed by the Kharijite rebel al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani.; ; . Governor of Egypt In 724 al-Hurr was appointed by Hisham as governor of Egypt as a replacement for his second cousin Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Arriving in Egypt in early May, he assumed control over matters of security, but the province's finances were separately managed by Ubaydallah ibn al- Habhab.; . During al-Hurr's governorship, Ibn al-Habhab attempted to impose additional taxes on the populace, adding at least one carat (1/24th) to each dinar levy. This move caused the outbreak of a widespread revolt in Lower Egypt in 725‚Äì726, with the residents of Natu, Tumayy, Qurbayt, Turabiyya, and the eastern Hawf rising in up an event later described by the historian Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Kindi as the first Coptic rebellion against the Arabs. In response, al-Hurr relocated to Damietta in order to lead operations against the rebels, and after three months of inflicting heavy casualties on the insurgents he succeeded in restoring order in the province.; ; ; . claims that Ubaydallah had doubled the tax rate and conscripted the Egyptians into forced labor; he does not mention al-Hurr's specific role in the revolt but states that uprisings took place in Bana, Sa, and Samannud, and that the resulting fighting between the Christians and Muslims was bloody. While in Egypt al-Hurr also worked with Hisham to resettle a group of Syrian Arabs to the eastern Delta and built a covered market street on new land created from a recession of the Nile.; ; . In 726 he briefly departed the province to meet with the caliph in Syria, leaving his prefect of police Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al- Hadrami to manage affairs during his absence. He remained as governor until 727, when a dispute between him and Ibn al-Habhab caused the latter to write a letter of complaint to the caliph; in response al-Hurr agreed to step down from office and was replaced by Hafs.; . Governor of Mosul A short time after his dismissal from Egypt, al-Hurr received an appointment from Hisham for the governorship of Mosul. Al-Azdi dates the start of al-Hurr's governorship to 724‚Äì725, but as this overlaps with his tenure in Egypt modern historians instead place his appointment in 727 or later.; . While in Mosul al-Hurr initiated a building program for several major private and public developments, putting him in line with a long Marwanid tradition of investing in improvement projects for the city. Among these were the construction of a new palace located near the city markets which al-Hurr intended to have serve as the governor's residence. The large complex, called al-Manqusha or the Decorated Palace, was so-named for its ornamentation made up of teak, alabaster, and other materials. The palace at least partially survived into the 13th century, when it was reported by the chronicler Ali ibn al-Athir as being in a ruined state.; . The largest single development begun by al-Hurr was for the cutting of a canal that ran from the Tigris to the center of Mosul, an undertaking characterized by Chase F. Robinson as \\"the most impressive building project\\" completed in the city in the early Marwanid period. The canal, which was known as the Uncovered River (al-nahr al- makshuf), was laid out to increase the accessibility of drinking water for the city, and thousands of laborers and planners were brought in to participate in its excavation. The cost of the project was enormous and paying for it required the use of the entirety of the provincial revenues, with the result that no money was forwarded to the central government during its construction. Work on the canal continued after al-Hurr's death and the project was finally completed in 738‚Äì739.; . Al-Hurr died in 731 and was buried in Mosul.; . Upon his death his son Yahya inherited his palace as well as numerous houses, inns, and estates, and his family retained ownership of extensive properties in the Mosul area for the duration of the Umayyad era.; . The extent of these properties were such that the area they were located in came to be known as \\"al-Hurr.\\" The family was later dispossessed of their estates in the region following Yahya ibn al-Hurr's execution.

It tried to implement libertarian communism, and that it extended by points of Extremadura, Andalusia, Catalunya and the mining basin of Le√≥n. December 1933 was the third and last of the insurrections carried out by the CNT during the Second Republic. It began in Zaragoza on December 8, 1933, the same day that the new Republican Courts met after the electoral victory of the center-right Radical Republican Party and the Catholic right of the CEDA. By one week later, on December 15, the insurrection had been completely dominated by law enforcement and even by the intervention of the army. On December 18, the first government of the Radical Republican Party was formed, chaired by Alejandro Lerroux during the Second Biennium of the Second Spanish Republic, with support from outside the CEDA.  History = Beginnings  Buenaventura Durruti The new government had not yet been constituted, when the third anarchist insurrection in the history of the Republic broke out. The decision had been taken as soon as the result of the first round of the November 1933 elections was known in a National Plenary Session of the CNT held in Zaragoza on November 26. A revolutionary committee in charge of organizing the revolt emerged from, among others, Buenaventura Durruti, Cipriano Mera, Antonio Ejarque and Joaqu√≠n Ascaso, many of them members of the FAI. On the same day the new Cortes were opened, on December 8, the civil governor of Zaragoza ordered the closure of the CNT premises as a preventive measure and deployed law enforcement onto the streets, which caused shootings and confrontations between policemen and the revolutionaries to spread. In a city paralyzed by the strike, twelve people died on only the first day. On December 14 a state of war was declared and the army intervened to restore order, assault guards escorted the soldiers by the trams. On December 15 the CNT gave the order to return to work and the next day the police arrested the revolutionary committee.  Development  The insurrectionary movement that began in Zaragoza spread to other towns in Aragon and La Rioja. Where libertarian communism was proclaimed, the most serious events took place, all of them following a similar scheme: attempt to seize the Civil Guard barracks, arrest of the authorities and ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù people, burning of property files and official documents and supply of products ‚Äúin accordance with the norms libertarian communism‚Äù. The government response was always the same: a harsh repression. There were also anarchist uprisings in isolated points of Extremadura, Andalusia, Catalunya and the mining basin of Le√≥n, which was completely dominated by December 15.  Consequences  The balance of the seven days of the anarchist insurrection was 75 dead and 101 wounded, among the insurgents, and 11 civil guards and 3 assault guards killed and 45 and 18 wounded, respectively, among law enforcement. For its part, the failure left the CNT broken and disjointed, and without organs of expression. The more moderate trade union leaders who had been expelled from the CNT, such as Juan Peir√≥ from the Libertarian Syndicalist Federation, blamed the disaster on the most radical faction of anarcho-syndicalism, the FAI, whose members had dominated the \\"revolutionary committee\\" of the insurrection. During the insurrection, there were violent clashes with the police force, train derailments, explosions, destruction of files, burning of churches, sabotage of railways and bridges, as well as telegraph and telephone lines, along with numerous shootings and skirmishes. Nineteen died due to the derailment of the Barcelona-Seville high speed train, in Puzol.

It is part of the 401st Tactical Composite Wing and operates the General Dynamics F-16A/B Fighting Falcon, Northrop RF-5E Tigergazer and Northrop F-5F Tiger II from Hualien Air Force Base, Hualien County. History=1997 to present General Dynamics RF-16A Fighting Falcon 6718 of the 12th TRS at Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, 2014. Up until 1998, the 12th TRS were operating the Lockheed TF/RF-104G Stargazer and Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II from Taoyuan Air Base, Taoyuan. With the forthcoming retirement of the Starfighter, the 12th TRS began to convert to the Northrop RF-5E Tigergazer, with deliveries first arriving in August 1997. On 22 May 1998, the last two TF-104Gs (4186 and 4196) were retired in a ceremony at Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taichung. On 1 July 1998, the 12th TRS relocated to Hualien Air Force Base, Hualien County, and converted to the General Dynamics F-16A/B Fighting Falcon, which replaced the F-5Es. The squadron's RF-5Es were also transferred to the 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron during this time. The 12th TRS' F-16As are equipped with Phoenix Eye reconnaissance pods, leading to an unofficial designation of RF-16A. In May 2011, the 12th TRS began to receive the RF-5E back from the 4th TRS, starting with 5503 and 5506. On 13 September 2011, 5506 and F-5F 5401 of the 4th TRS both crashed into a mountain during a night-time sortie, killing all crew.

It is set northeast of the town of Index, and north-northeast of Gunn Peak, its nearest higher neighbor. This mountain is situated in the Wild Sky Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skykomish River. The first ascent of the highest Northwest Spire was made in 1934 by Dwight Dean and Kenneth Chapman. The first ascent of the Central Spire (6,200-ft) was made in 1938 by Karl Boyer, Lyman Boyer, and David Lind. The Southeast Spire is estimated as 6,185 feet in elevation. Climate Spire Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The photograph was taken in New York using the small 4 x 5 camera, which was a more practical instrument to document the city life than the 8 x 10 view camera, who could only work with a tripod. This is one of the pictures that Stieglitz took using this medium, following his aim to elevate photography to an art status. Stieglitz described the origin of this picture: \\"From 1893 to 1895 I often walked the streets of New York downtown, near the East River, taking my hand camera with me... [One day] I found myself in front of the old Post Office... It was extremely cold. Snow lay on the ground. A driver in a rubber coat was watering his steaming car horses.\\" The picture is devoid of any romantic intention, just depicting the driver watering his horses in front of the Astor House. Stieglitz work can be seen as an example of pictorialism and what would be called later straight photography.

Unlike the 'Northern Netherlands', where a set of united provinces and cities proclaimed its independence in 1581 and would become the Dutch Republic in 1588, the southern Low Countries would remain dependent territories throughout this time. These non-sovereign territories included the Habsburg-owned Southern Netherlands (Spanish Netherlands until 1715, Austrian Netherlands until 1795), the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge (until 1795), the Princely Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy (until 1794), the Prince- Bishopric of Cambr√©sis and the Imperial City of Cambray (until 1678), the Duchy of Bouillon (until 1795), and some western parts of the Duchy of J√ºlich (until 1795). Aside from these, there were various other small political entities such as the County of Enghien (until 1569), the Imperial Lordship of Kessenich (until 1784), the Duchy of Aarschot, the Duchy of Hoogstraten, the County of Horne, the Double Lordship of Maastricht, the Redemptiedorpen, the County of the Vroenhof (all until 1795), and so on. During the Brabant and Li√®ge Revolutions (1789‚Äì1791), the United Belgian States and Li√®ge Republic briefly achieved de facto independence, but remained unrecognised before the Habsburgs restored their power, and French Revolutionary armies soon conquered all the southern Low Countries and annexed them into the French First Republic in 1795. Most of the Low Countries were unified in 1815 as the newly created United Kingdom of the Netherlands under the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the newly created Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, until the Belgian Revolution broke out in 1830. * For earlier wars, see List of wars in the Low Countries until 1560. * For simultaneous wars in the Northern Netherlands, see List of wars involving the Netherlands (1560‚Äìpresent) * For subsequent wars in the southern Low Countries, see **List of wars involving Belgium (1830‚Äìpresent), from the Belgian Revolution onwards **List of wars involving Luxembourg (1890‚Äìpresent). { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Start ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Finish ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Name of conflict ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Belligents ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Outcome - ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Combatant 1 ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Combatant 2 -valign=\\"top\\"  1566  1648  Eighty Years' War (also called the Dutch Revolt) (mixed with the Thirty Years' War)  border Spanish Empire (incl.

The total number of literate people in Haripur was 667 (76.14% of the population over 6 years). Culture The Harihar Mahadev temple is a squarish brick-built structure, that has sunk considerably because of an earthquake. Devotees have to descend 8 ft, stepping over 8 stairs to reach the Shiva linga in the garbhagriha or the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. A tin shed has been built over the entrance door to prevent rainwater from entering the temple. The temple now measures in height. The original height must have been around . The temple is a square. The temple is estimated to have been built in the 18th century by the Cooch Behar State rulers. There are some stone decorations in the walls, which seem to be of an earlier period, but these may have been brought from other temples.

It is the 3rd largest manufacturer of tractors in India, with the capacity to produce 3 lakh tractors a year, as of June 2017. It manufactures tractors ranging from 20 HP to 120 HP. The company is owned and operated by International Tractors Limited, the flagship firm of Sonalika Group. It was founded in 1995. Sonalika Tractors wields about 11.7% market share of the Indian tractor industry. Sonalika Tractors owns a 70 per cent stake in the company while Japanese diesel engine manufacturer, Yanmar hold 30 per cent stake. It was selected for the 'Champions of Change' 2017 programme organized by Niti Aayog.  History  The brand Sonalika Tractors is owned and operated by International Tractors Limited, which was incorporated in 1995. It was founded by Lachhman Das Mittal. It sold its first tractor in 1996. The Vice President of India, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat symbolically handing over Sonalika tractors gifted by India to Armenia at his meeting with the Armenian Minister of Agriculture, Davit Lokyan in Yerevan on October 7, 2005 In 2000, Renault Agriculture, a French tractor maker, acquired a 20% stake in the company for 80 million francs (equivalent to $11.4 million in 2000) and formed a Sonalika-Renault joint venture to market its tractors worldwide. After tie-up with Renault Agriculture, the company started producing licensed Renault tractors under the Renault Sonalika International. However, the tractors are marketed under 'Solis' brand name while it is marketed under the 'Sonalika' brand name in India. In August 2005, Sonalika bought back its stake from Renault when Renault Agriculture was acquired by Germany's Claas Motors. In October 2005, Yanmar, a Japanese company, acquired a 12% stake in Sonalika. In October 2012, The Blackstone Group bought a 12.5 per cent stake in the company for Rs 520 crore. The investment from Blackstone made the company valued at Rs 4,200 crore in 2012. The market share of Sonalika Tractors was also increased from 7.8 per cent (in 2011) to 9.9 per cent in 2013. The company launched a heavy range air-conditioned tractor series called Worldtrac 90 in June 2013. In December 2016, Yanmar bought 18 per cent stake in Sonalika for about Rs 1,600 crore. Currently, it owns a 30 per cent stake in the company after Blackstone exit. It formed a new joint venture with FAMAG in Algeria in October 2018.

The set of strings matching a given parameter word is called a parameter set or combinatorial cube. Parameter words can be composed, to produce smaller subcubes of a given combinatorial cube. They have applications in Ramsey theory and in computer science in the detection of duplicate code. Definitions and notation Formally, a word of length n, over a given alphabet A, is a sequence of n characters, some of which may be drawn from A and the others of which are k distinct wildcard characters *_1,*_2,\\\\ldots, *_k. Each wildcard character is required to appear at least once, but may appear multiple times, and the wildcard characters must appear in the order given by their indexes: the first wildcard character in the word must be *_1, the next one that is different from *_1 must be *_2, etc. As a special case, a word over the given alphabet, without any wildcard characters, is said to be a 0-parameter word. For 1-parameter words, the subscripts may be omitted, as there is no ambiguity between different wildcard characters. The set of all words over A, of length n, is A word represents a set of A^k strings (0-parameter words), obtained by substituting a symbol of A for each wildcard character. This set of strings is called a parameter set of combinatorial cube, and k is called its dimension. A one-dimensional combinatorial cube may be called a combinatorial line. In a combinatorial cube, each copy of a particular wildcard character must have the same replacement. A generalization of parameter words allows different copies of the same wildcard character to be replaced by different characters from the alphabet, in a controlled way. If A is an alphabet and G is a group with an action on A, then a parameter word is a word together with an assignment of a group element to each wildcard character in the word. The first occurrence of each wildcard character must be assigned the identity element of the group. Then, the strings represented by a labeled parameter word are obtained by choosing a character of A for each wildcard character, and substituting the result of combining that character with the group element labeling each copy of that character. The set of all words over A, of length n, is Example In the game of tic-tac-toe, the cells of the game board can be given two integer coordinates (x,y) from the alphabet {1,2,3}. Concatenating these two coordinates produces a string representing each cell, one of the nine strings 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, or 33. There are seven one-parameter words of length two over this alphabet, the words 1*, 2*, 3*, *1, *2, *3, and **. The corresponding combinatorial lines form seven of the eight lines of three cells in a row of the tic-tac-toe board; for instance, the one-parameter word 2* corresponds to the combinatorial line {21, 22, 23}, and the one-parameter word ** corresponds to the combinatorial However, one of the eight winning lines of the tic-tac-toe game is missing from this set of combinatorial lines: the antidiagonal It is possible to obtain this line as a combinatorial line (without including any other combinations of cells that would be invalid for tic-tac-toe) by using a group with two elements, and an action in which the non-identity element swaps the alphabet letters 1 and 3 while leaving the element 2 in place. There are eight labeled one-parameter words of length two for this action, seven of which are obtained from the unlabeled one-parameter words by using the identity label for all wildcards. These seven have the same combinatorial lines as before. The eighth labeled word consists of the word ** labeled by the identity element for its first * and the reversing non-identity element for the second *; its combinatorial line is the final winning line of the tic-tac-toe board, Composition For three given integer parameters n\\\\ge m\\\\ge k, it is possible to combine two parameter words, f\\\\in A\\\\tbinom{n}{m} and g\\\\in A\\\\tbinom{m}{k}, to produce another parameter word f\\\\circ g\\\\in A\\\\tbinom{n}{k}. To do so, simply replace each copy of the ith wildcard symbol in f by the ith character in g. This will necessarily produce a word of length n that uses each of the wildcard symbols in g at least once, in ascending order, so it produces a valid word of length n. This notion of composition can also be extended to composition of labeled parameter words (both using the same alphabet and group action), by applying the group action to the non- wildcard substituted characters and composing the group labels for the wildcard substituted characters. A subset of a combinatorial cube is a smaller combinatorial cube if it can be obtained by a composition in this way. Combinatorial enumeration The number of parameter words in A\\\\tbinom{n}{k} for an alphabet of size r is an r-Stirling number of the second kind \\\\textstyle\\\\left{ {r+n \\\\atop r+k} \\\\right}_r. These numbers count the number of partitions of the integers in the range [1,r+n] into r+k non-empty subsets such that the first r integers belong to distinct subsets. Partitions of this type can be placed into a bijective equivalence with the parameter words, by creating a word with a character for each of the n integers in the range [r+1,n+r], setting this character value to be either an integer in [1,r] belonging to the same subset of the partition, or a wildcard character for each subset of the partition that does not contain an integer in [1,r]. The r-Stirling numbers obey a simple recurrence relation by which they may easily be calculated. Applications In Ramsey theory, parameter words and combinatorial cubes may be used to formulate the Graham‚ÄìRothschild theorem, according to which, for every finite alphabet and group action, and every combination of integer values m, k, and r, there exists a sufficiently large number n such that if each combinatorial cube over strings of length n is assigned one of r colors, then there exists a combinatorial cube all of whose subcubes have the same color. This result is a key foundation for structural Ramsey theory, and is used to define Graham's number, an enormous number used to estimate the value of n for a certain combination of values. In computer science, in the problem of searching for duplicate code, the source code for a given routine or module may be transformed into a parameter word by converting it into a sequence of tokens, and for each variable or subroutine name, replacing each copy of the same name with the same wildcard character. If code is duplicated, the resulting parameter words will remain equal even if some of the variables or subroutines have been renamed. More sophisticated searching algorithms can find long duplicate code sections that form substrings of larger source code repositories, by allowing the wildcard characters to be substituted for each other. An important special case of parameter words, well-studied in the combinatorics of words, is given by the partial words. These are strings with wildcard characters that may be substituted independently of each other, without requiring that some of the substituted characters be equal or controlled by a group action. In the language of parameter words, a partial word may be described as a parameter word in which each wildcard symbol appears exactly once. However, because there is no repetition of wildcard symbols, partial words may be written more simply by omitting the subscripts on the wildcard symbols.

The line operates every 30 minutes during the weekday peak- hours only and 60 minutes at all other times, at a combined frequency of 15 minutes (peak-hours) or 30 minutes (at all other times). Trips roughly take 60 minutes (D12) or 80-90 minutes (D13, D14). Background Routes D12, D13, and D14 operate between Southern Avenue station and Suitland station mainly connecting riders along Saint Barnabas Road for the D12, and Brinkley Road, Allentown Road, and Indian Head Highway for routes D13 and D14. Routes D12 and D14 operate daily while route D13 operates during the weekday peak hours in the peak direction. Route D13 follows much of the D14 routing except skipping the D12 and D14 routing along Audrey Lane, Irvington Street, Glassmanor Drive, Kennebec Street, Deal Drive, and Marcy Avenue. Routes D12, D13, and D14 currently operate out of Andrews Federal Center garage full-time with select peak-hour trips operating out of Shepherd Parkway garage. The line formally operated out of Southern Avenue garage on weekdays and Shepherd Parkway on weekends. History Routes D12 and D14 was originally operated under the Washington Marlboro & Annapolis Motor Lines Inc. (WM&A;) which operated between Eastover Shopping Center and Downtown Washington DC beginning in 1945 (D14) and 1948 (D12). The line was connected via South Capitol Street towards Downtown (11th and E Streets NW). Route D12 originally was named Route D while route D14 was originally named Route M. In 1953 WM&A; adopted letter designations for its routes with new routes D12 and D14. In 1973, routes D12 and D14 were acquired by WMATA when they acquired the WM&A.; Later, route D14 would be eliminated, but a new route S12 would be introduced to operate alongside the D12. Route S12 would operate between Southview apartments and Federal Center station while route D12 operate between Marlow Heights and Federal Center station. At the time, the line was run as the Eastover‚ÄìMarlow Heights Line. 1978 Changes On November 21, 1978, both routes D12 and S12 were shorten to operate between Eastover Shopping Center and Federal Center station. S12 service between Southview Apartments and Eastover was replaced by route P12. 2000 Changes On January 3, 2000, new boarding and alighting restrictions were implemented on route D12. During the AM rush, passengers can get on and off any southbound D12 bus going to Marlow Heights at any bus stop in Maryland and the District of Columbia with restrictions for northbound buses not changing. Passengers can get on and off the bus in Maryland but only get off the bus at stops in the District of Columbia. During the PM rush, passengers can get on and off northbound buses going to Federal Center SW at any bus stop in Maryland and the District of Columbia with southbound restrictions not changing. Passengers can only get on the bus in the District of Columbia, and get on or off the bus at any stop in Maryland. 2001 Changes On January 13, 2001 when the Green Line extension to Branch Avenue station opened, route D12 was rerouted to operate between Suitland station and Southern Avenue station mainly operating along Saint Barnabas Road, Oxon Hill Road, Indian Head Highway, and Southern Avenue. Buses were also rerouted via 28th Avenue and Keith Street (behind Marlow Heights Shopping Center) and extended from the shopping center to the Suitland station via Branch Avenue and Saint Barnabas and Silver Hill roads. Routes W11 and W12 from the Eastover‚ÄìIndian Head Highway Line were also rerouted to operate alongside the D12 between Southern Avenue and Suitland stations and were renamed into routes D13 (W11) and D14 (W12). The line would mainly operate along Suitland Road, Allentown Road, Brinkley Road, Livingston Road, Indian Head Highway, and Southern Avenue. The line also operated via Andrews Air Force Base, as well as the Camp Springs, Temple Hills, and Glassmanor neighborhoods, which former Routes W11, W12, and W17 originally operated on between the Federal Center SW station and Acokeek. All route S12 service was eliminated in the process being replaced by route D12, and P12. 2010 Proposed Changes In 2010 during WMATA's FY2011 budget, WMATA proposed to divert routes D13 and D14 into Oxon Hill Park & Ride Lot off Oxon Hill Road just west of Indian Head Highway in order to create a transfer connection between those routes and the NH1, which serves National Harbor. This would provide closer connections to National Harbor for passengers instead of having to take the Green Line to Branch Avenue station. 2019 Changes Beginning on October 15, 2019 for two years, eastbound D13 and D14 buses were forced to detour due to the Maryland State Highway Administration‚Äôs Maryland Route 210 Interchange Project. This prevents buses from turning left from Indian Head Hwy - MD 210 onto Livingston Road. As a result, routes D13 and D14 were forced to backtrack along Indian Head Highway detouring on Wilson Bridge Drive, before resuming its regular route Lindsay Rd at Livingston Rd. A temporary time transfer was also implemented for affected passengers at closed bus stops westbound. Westbound buses were unaffected by the detour.

At the date of the Muster Roll of January 24, 1625 (census), Spencer was reported as residing on his property on Jamestown Island with his wife Alice and their daughter, also named Alice, who was 4 years old. William and Alice had a young son who died some time between February 1624 and the muster of January 24, 1625 (new style calendar).McCartney, 2007, p. 663. They had two daughters who lived to adulthood. Anne Spencer married William Cockeram and Elizabeth Spencer married in turn Robert Sheppard, Thomas Warren and John Hunnicut. According to McCartney, from 1620 to at least 1626 Spencer was the overseer of property in the \\"Governor's Land\\" owned by Captain William Peirce (burgess), later a member of the House of Burgesses for Jamestown in 1624 and a member of the Council of State from 1632 to 1643.McCartney, 2007, pp. 546, 662.

Burgess  William Spencer was a member of the House of Burgesses in 1632/33 and later session in 1633 for Mulberry Island.In Stanard's Abstract of Spencer's land patent, July 1893, Spencer is shown as a burgess for Mulberry Island in 1623. This is an obvious typographical error since neither Stanard's Virginia Colonial Register, 1902, nor McIlwaine, H. R., ed. Volume 1 of Journals of the House of Burgesses, 1619 - 1658/59. Richmond, VA, 1915 show Spencer as a member of the House of Burgesses in 1623 but both show him as a member for Mulberry Island in 1632-33 as does McCartney, 2007, p. 662. Similarly, a jury list from August 5, 1623 reprinted in Minutes of the Council and General Court, 1622-1624. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Volume 19, No. 2, 1911: p. 129, , shows \\"Ensign William Spenc gents\\" as a member. Without explicitly saying this could be either William Spence or William Spencer, a footnote states that Spence was a burgess in 1619 and Spencer was a burgess for Mulberry Island in 1623. This appears to be the same typographical error since, again, there is no list of burgesses that shows Spencer as a burgess for Mulberry Island, or any other burgess for Mulberry Island, in 1623. The article itself does not show the name of the editor who wrote the prefatory note and the footnotes. McCartney notes that William Peirce also had an investment in property on Mulberry Island.  Later life; Death  McCartney states that Spencer was a tobacco viewer for the territory between Lawnes Creek and Hog Island in 1640, but land records indicate that Spencer died in 1638. McCartney also states that Spencer conducted business for Captain William Peirce as late as 1655 but also states that Peirce died before June 22, 1647McCartney, 2007, p. 546.This is another inconsistency with the records showing Spencer died in 1638.In one of the timelines at the Ancient Planter genealogical source cited earlier a date of death for William Spencer at July 5, 1654, age 94, from the wikitree web site is given. This is inconsistent with the preceding text on the same page showing various dates of birth and land transfer record citations that record Spencer's death in 1637 or 1638 (new style). It also uses the earliest date cited for Spencer's birth which is clearly uncertain, and probably unlikely, given other conflicting text. More certain sources, land transfer records, show that Spencer died on February 10, 1637 (1638 new style).Holtzclaw, 1939, p. 568: From Surry Co., VA Deed & Will BK 1645-1671, page 287: A deed witnessed by Nicholas Spencer, Sr. and Daniel Williams. On 04 Jan 1685/6, William Cockerham (son of William) deeded to William Harris a parcel of land on Hog Island Main, part of a patent of 1350 acres \\"granted to Mr. William Spencer late of this county, dec'd., the 10th day of Feby., 1637 and from the said Spencer descended to me the said Cockram.\\" William Spencer was granted two large parcels of land; the first, 19 Jun 1635, for 1100 acres was \\"in the tenure\\" of Major Robert Sheppard, who sold it to William Caulfield; the second 10 Feb 1637, for 1350 acres (cf. Nugent, p. 81) descended to William Cockerham and later to his son, William, who deeded part of it away in 1685/6. The article by Holtzclaw, October 1939, p. 368, cites this deed and other references and concludes that one of William Spencer's daughter married William Cockerham and the other married Robert Sheppard and thus William Spencer had no male heirs. This supports a date of death in 1637 (1638 new style calendar) for William Spencer, although Holtzclaw states that the exact date of Spencer's death is uncertain.

In 1659 the lordship (including the castle) was purchased by Cardinal Mazarin, together with the much larger Duchy of Nevers. Noble L√©onard Guyot de Montchougny then acquired it in 1710, and the castle remained in the property of his descendants until 1896. Later owners included a Swedish aristocrat, Count Nils de Brack, a painter and stoneware artist (1926-1930); and Jules Guiraud, a deputy governor of the Banque de France (1935-1947). It was purchased by the town of Saint-Amand in October 1985. Architecture The castle is representative of the French Renaissance architecture of the reign of Francis I. Its ornate dormer windows (lucarnes) are particularly noteworthy. Interior features include a grand staircase, a chapel, and a kitchen. Stoneware Museum The Mus√©e du Gr√®s inside the castle displays local production of stoneware (gr√®s in French), for which Saint-Amand and the surrounding region of Puisaye are renowned, including works of Jean-Joseph Carri√®s who had a workshop in the town.

Early life and education Kindred was born on April 12, 1941, in Atlanta, Illinois, USA. When he was a teenager his mother bought him a typewriter for his birthday and he wrote about Stan Musial. At around the same age, he aspired to become sportswriter Red Smith and would pick up his columns from the train station every Sunday morning. Kindred attended Atlanta High School where he played on their basketball team, leading them to the 1959 regional championship. He continued his aspirations to become a sportswriter although he was discouraged by his English teacher who said, \\"Maybe one day you can grow up and be a foreign correspondent.\\" After graduating, Kindred attended Wesleyan University on a journalism scholarship and competed on their Division III baseball team. While in school and for two years after, he worked full-time on the sports section of the The Pantagraph.

Career Kindred left The Pantagraph in 1965 to become a staff writer and columnist for The Courier-Journal. During his tenure at the paper, he followed Muhammad Ali and eventually published a condensed dual biography of Howard Cosell and Ali in 2006. In his first year at the Courier- Journal, while working at the copy desk, he was informed that Ali was in town and told to find him. Upon finding him, Kindred and Ali drove around Louisville to his neighborhood and hometown hangouts for the day. As they became more familiar with one another, Ali nicknamed Kindred \\"Louisville\\" for he was his hometown guy. Kindred estimates that he's interviewed Ali around 300 times across numerous locations including Madison Square Garden and his various homes. Along with covering Ali, Kindred also reported on the 1972 Summer Olympics, and the subsequent Munich massacre, and the 1976 Summer Olympics. As a result of his journalism work, he received a 1971 general interest National Headline Award and numerous \\"Sportswriter of the Year\\" awards. Kindred eventually left to join The Washington Post in the summer of 1977 as their new sports columnist. Speaking of his time there he said, \\"I wrote four or five times per week from everywhere in the world on every major sporting event, every time trying to make the column the best one I ever wrote.\\" His first column for the Post was on George Allen as coach of the Washington Redskins. Kindred stayed at the Washington Post until 1984 before writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The National Sports Daily. In his first year with the Sports Daily, Kindred received the Red Smith Award for outstanding contributions to sports journalism. He continued to write for the National Sports Daily and Golf Digest from the 1990s through the turn of the 21st century. Kindred was inducted into the U.S. Basketball Writers Hall of Fame and National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was recognized by the Basketball Hall of Fame with the Curt Gowdy Print Media Award. Eleven years later, he was named the recipient of the Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism and received the 2010 PGA Lifetime Achievement Award in Journalism. In 2019, Kindred donated his sports journalism collection of over 50 years to his alma maters Tate Archives and Special Collections.

History Service in Central Prince George's County, Maryland was originally operated by various Metrobus lines until the 1990s. These lines connected Capitol Heights, Maryland to Downtown DC and Central Prince Georges County. But the routes were slowly eliminated and replaced by Metrorail after 1978. Eventually, three lines were created to operate into Central Prince Georges County. The Pointer Ridge‚ÄìAddison Road Line (C21, C22, C29), Kingsford‚ÄìAddison Road Line (C21, C22, C29), Kingsford‚ÄìAddison Road Line (C23, C24, C25, and C26), and Pointer Ridge Line (C28). These lines would connect Addison Road station (C21, C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C29) and New Carrollton station (C28) to East Kettering, Pointer Ridge (C21, C22, C29), Collington Center (C21, C22), and Bowie Town Center (C29). Route C29 would operate on the C28 routing on Saturday between Bowie Town Center and Pointer Ridge plus operate on a combination of the C22 and C26 routing. Eventually prior to 1998, both the Central Avenue Line and Kingsford‚ÄìAddison Road Line would merge into a single route. Routes C25 and C26 joined the C21, C22, and C29 while routes C23 and C24 were eliminated. The C25 and C26 routing remained the same during the merger of the routes. The line was renamed into the Central Avenue Line as a result. There was no Sunday service on any of the routes. 1999 Changes On September 20, 1999, route C26 buses going to Addison Road station in the morning was changed to operate westbound on Lake Arbor Way and turn south into Campus Way North. In the afternoon, buses going to East Kettering was also changed to operate north on Campus Way North and turn right into Lake Arbor Way. 2004 Changes On December 18, 2004 when the Blue Line extension to Largo Town Center station opened, routes C21, C22, C26, and C29 was rerouted to serve the new station.

From Largo, C21, C22, and C29 buses will run via Largo Drive West, Largo Center and Apollo Drives, Lottsford Road, Arena Drive and Brightseat Road to Central Avenue and Addison Road station. C21 and C22 buses also would serve Centre Pointe Office Park on Brightseat Road. Service to Hampton Towne Centre would be eliminated. New Sunday service was also added to route C29 but only operating between Pointer Ridge and Addison Road station as a combination to routes C22 and C26. 2005 Changes On May 28, 2005, a new route C27 was introduced to operate during the summer seasons between Addison Road station and Pointer Ridge via Largo Town Center station under a similar routing to the C25. Initially, the line would only operate on Saturdays between Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends, but have since expanded to daily summer service. 2006 Changes On March 18, 2006, route C29 was extended to serve Bowie State University from the intersection of Northview Drive and Collington Road. The current C29 routing via the Bowie Park & Ride lot and South Belair to Belair Center was discontinued due to low ridership. This routing was a combination of routes B21, B22, B24, B25, B27, B29, and B31, during the weekends except serving Addison Road station instead of New Carrollton station. 2018 Changes On February 23, 2018, routes C22 and C29 discontinued service along Harry S. Truman Drive south of Mount Lubentia Way due to a long-term construction project. Stops along Harry S. Truman Drive near Mount Lubentia Way, New Orchard Drive, Woodlawn Boulevard, and Birdie Lane will not be served. Customers may board buses at stops along Mount Lubentia Way near Harry S.

Although serving ordinarily as a reconnaissance and bombardment role, they also flew as gunships to escort bombing missions. The squadron was credited with destroying 37 German aircraft. History Escadrille 46 (\\"small squadron 46\\") was founded in March 1915 with twin-engine three-seated Caudrons, hence Escadrille C46. Originally attached to VI Armee, the squadron was posted to the II Armee in September 1915.Over the Front: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914‚Äì1918, p. 92 The squadron flew their Caudron G.IV bombers during the Battle of Verdun, which kicked off on 21 February 1916. In June it refitted with Caudron R.IVs; their unit designation changed to Escadrille R.46. Then, beginning 1 July, while attached to VI Armee, it fought in the Battle of the Somme as it eventuated. On 15 January 1917, the unit won its first citation while still with VI Armee. Despite flying bombers, they had shot down 15 German aircraft. Two months later, they would trade their Caudrons for Letord Let.1 Type 1s. Their unit designation was altered to Escadrille Let 46. When the Battle of the Aisne began in April 1917, Escadrille Let 46 was attached to Felix Brocard's Groupe de Combat 12 for the fight. When their commanding officer, Didier Lecour Grandmaison, his replacement, Marcel Bloch led it as it re-equipped again, this time with Caudron R.XI three seated bombers. The unit designation reverted to Escadrille C46 on 17 February 1918. The squadron operated as part of Groupe de Combat 15 in the Champagne region until 14 May 1918. Then, for the last months of the war, the squadron was bundled along with other squadrons into ever-larger makeshift aviation units. On 12 September 1918, while fighting in the 1er Armee sector, it was awarded its second citation for valor, earning the escadrille the right to the Fourragere of the Croix de guerre. Ten days later, it was posted to support of the American 1st Army at Battle of Saint-Mihiel. On 23 September 1918, the escadrille was assigned to fly as gunships to protect bombing missions, as the Caudron R.XIs mounted five machine guns apiece.The Aerodrome website Retrieved 10 August 2020.

He is known for his work with Harry Miller and his long involvement in the design and ongoing development of the four-cylinder Offenhauser (\\"Offy\\") racing engine. Goossen is considered to have been the preeminent American designer of racing engines over a fifty year period that began in the early 1920s. Early years Goossen's parents, Izaac and Kate, immigrated to the US from the Netherlands. They settled in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where Goossen was born. The family later moved to Flint, Michigan. In 1908 Goossen left school at 16 to work as a blueprint machine operator in the engineering department of the Buick division of the nascent General Motors. He continued his education by taking classes in mathematics and engineering at night. Goossen's work caught the attention of two of Buick's principals at the time: Chief Engineer Enos Anson (E.A.) de Waters and Engine Designer Walter E. Marr. When Marr retired and relocated to Chattanooga, Tennessee, he continued to work on special projects for the division. Goossen relocated to Chatanooga to collaborate with Marr. In or around 1917 Goossen was diagnosed with tuberculosis, discovered during a military medical exam. He spent time in a sanatorium, but was told to relocate to a drier climate to complete his convalescence. Goossen left Buick in January 1919, and moved to the southwestern US. While there he worked briefly as a cow-hand near Silver City, New Mexico. From New Mexico Goossen went to Los Angeles. He applied for a job at the Miller race car workshop, and presented a letter of reference written by Walter P. Chrysler. Goossen began working for Miller in August 1919. Automotive design career=1910s Goossen's design career started at Buick. Early on he was asked to create tracings for components used in the 1910 Buick 60 Special, also called the \\"Buick Bug\\". He designed the engine for a 1914 Buick cyclecar prototype. He was also involved in the design of the 1915 Buick \\"Twin-Six\\" V12 engine as well as a V6. 1920s After moving to Miller, one of Goossen's first projects was to produce drawings for an advanced racing car whose design was already completed. His first major engine project was to complete the design for the straight four-cylinder double overhead cam (DOHC) T-4 engine to power Edward Maier's \\"TNT Special\\", named for Maier's TNT Auto Company. Goossen's valvetrain designs included a variation of the cup tappets he had seen on a damaged Ballot engine, but in Goossen's design the upper surface of the tappet was radiused. From December 1920 to January 1921 Goossen worked with racing driver Tommy Milton to design a new engine, which Milton then commissioned Miller to produce. Driver Ira Vail also ordered a copy of the engine. The engine was a DOHC straight-eight engine with four valves per cylinder, a barrel crankcase, tubular connecting rods, three main bearings and with cylinders and heads cast en bloc. This engine, called the Miller 183, set the pattern for many of Goossen's subsequent designs. Changes to engine rules announced for the 1923 Indianapolis 500 prompted Miller to have Goossen design a reduced-displacement engine based on the 183 called the Miller 122. This engine appeared in 1922. While many of the concepts developed on Goossen's drafting table came directly from Miller, the detail design was increasingly left up to Goossen. Miller himself did not have a formal engineering education. Eventually Miller stopped even checking Goossen's final drawings. Master machinist Fred Offenhauser used Goossen's drawings to produce the parts. In 1923 Goossen took part in designing a front-wheel-drive system that was used in many of Miller's Indianapolis racers. Miller applied for a patent for the system in 1925, which was granted in 1927. Miller's front-wheel-drive system was licensed by Errett Lobban Cord for use in the Cord L-29. Miller was paid $1000 per month licensing fee. For use in the Cord the system was extensively modified by Goossen and Cord engineer C. W. Van Ranst. The first prototype was running by 1927. In 1922‚Äì23 Goossen produced a DOHC cylinder head conversion for the four-cylinder Ford Model T engine that was used by Harry Hooker in his \\"Hooker 99\\" special driven by Elbert \\"Babe\\" Stapp. In 1926 Goossen produced a marine engine called the Miller 151. This engine was repurposed by some driver/owners for racing car use. It would go on to influence the four cylinder Offenhauser engine. Schofield produced a version of the 151 enlarged to . In 1930 Miller directed Goossen to draw up an even larger version. While a few engines of were built, the engine was soon enlarged to . Another new Miller Indianapolis straight-eight appeared in 1927. Called the Miller 91, it displaced just and had two valves per cylinder. With the addition of a centrifugal supercharger the earliest 91s produced while some later ones made as much as . Goossen called the Miller 91 his \\"baby\\". Goossen designed a one-off flat-eight marine engine called the Miller 148. Built in 1928, it was used in the racing boat Miss Rioco III. Boat and engine crashed and sank on their maiden outing. The engine was later recovered and finally restored in 2007. In an effort to increase the participation of major motor manufacturers at the Indianapolis 500, Speedway president Eddie Rickenbacker enacted a set of major rule changes for the 1930 race. The changes became known as the \\"Junk Formula\\", and they effectively obsoleted the Miller straight eight engines. In response, in 1929 Goossen designed a series of three cylinder head upgrades for the Model A engine: a high-compression flathead, an OHV that became known as the Miller Hi-Speed head, and a DOHC head. Boat racer James A. Talbot hired Miller to design a pair of new engines to power a boat that would contest the 1929 British International Trophy, also known as \\"The Harmsworth Cup\\". Goossen and L. A. Orsatti shared responsibility for the design. Each engine was to be configured as a 24 cylinder \\"W\\" with eight cylinders per bank, and would use cylinders, valvetrain components, and ignition system parts from Liberty. The dual ignition system was driven by six eight-cylinder distributors. A new aluminum crankcase was designed that retained the 45¬∞ inter-bank angle of the donor Liberty engines, allowing the same timing to be used. Other new parts included the cams, cam housings, articulated rods and crankshafts. Each engine displaced and developed an estimated at 2600 rpm. The engine was called the Miller-Liberty 3300. The engines were installed in Talbot's boat, named the Miss Los Angeles II. As installed, the crankshaft rotation of one engine was opposite that of the other. Miss Los Angeles II finished second in the 1929 Harmsworth. Afterwards the engines were bought by the Cragar Corporation with the intention that they would power a car called America 1 in an attempt on the world land speed record, but the car was never built. On 7 February 1929 Miller sold his company to the Schofield Corporation, which set up a subsidiary called the Miller Production Corporation Limited but which was commonly called Miller- Schofield. With US$5,000,000 of capitalization, the company was to manufacture Miller engines for aircraft, marine, and automotive use. From Miller the new company received machinery, drawings and patterns, and the rights to the series of performance cylinder heads designed by Goossen for Ford's Model A/B engine. The OHV version and a small number of the DOHC heads were built by Miller-Schofield. Goossen also went to Schofield, where his salary rose to $100 per month. In October 1929 the stock market crashed, and shortly after this Gilbert Beesemyer, one of Schofield's directors, admitted to having embezzled more than $8 million from the Guarantee Building & Loan Company. Schofield and the Miller Production Corporation filed for bankruptcy on 1 December 1930. Miller set up his own company again, with Goossen freelancing for him, including drawing up a four-cylinder at the behest of Offenhauser, who was running his own shop at this point and contracting back to Miller. Goossen did not join Offenhauser full-time until 1944. When Miller-Schofield failed, the Cragar company bought Miller-Schofield assets and put Goossen's OHV Model A/B heads back onto production. 1930s With financial backing from the Stutz Motor Company, engineer and racing driver Frank Lockhart built a streamliner called the Stutz Black Hawk Special to challenge the Land speed record. The engine for the car was built by Riley Brett. The powerplant consisted of two Miller 91 top ends mounted to a common crankcase at a 35¬∞ degree angle. The cylinder banks retained their individual crankshafts, which were geared together in the crankcase, with power leaving via an output gear mounted low in the case. The combined engines were supercharged, and Lockhart added two intercoolers. On April 25, 1928 the car went out of control during the return run of a record attempt at Daytona Beach, throwing Lockhart out to his death. The engine was salvaged, and later became the basis upon which the Sampson IC-30 Indy car of 1930 was built. Goossen became involved in the project at this time, working with Brett to design a new underslung chassis of box-section aluminum for the car. The front suspension used parallel quarter- elliptic leaf springs, while at the rear a De Dion tube was suspended on parallel torsion bars. The car appeared at the 1930 Indianapolis 500 for the first running of the so-called \\"Junk Formula\\". Driven by Louis Meyer, it took an early lead but had to pit for repairs. The car finished fourth. Also appearing at Indianapolis in 1930 was a car called the Summers-Miller. Harry Hartz had Miller produce a revised straight-eight for it. Goossen began with the Miller 122, and enlarged it to . This engine was installed in the car and won the 1930 Indianapolis 500 in the hands of driver Billy Arnold. In addition to the $1000 monthly licensing fee Miller received for the rights to his front-wheel-drive system, he was given a new Cord Brougham Sedan powered by a Lycoming straight-eight engine. Miller wanted a more powerful engine to replace the Lycoming. Goossen did the design for the new powerplant. The resulting engine was a V16 engine with two inline banks of eight cylinders set on a barrel crankcase with an included angle of 35¬∞ between banks. Each inline bank was made of two straight four cylinder modules with integral cylinder heads. Each cylinder head had two overhead camshafts and two valves per cylinder. Displacement was and power output was . In 1931 this engine appeared in an Indianapolis racing car. The car was in third place when it pitted to have its sixteen plugs replaced due to fouling. It returned to the track and was running in seventh position when it had to retire due to a broken connecting rod. One year later the engine and car appeared again, but dropped out of the race due to a broken oil line. At the 1931 Indianapolis race Miller met motorboat builder and racer Garfield Arthur \\"Gar\\" Wood. Wood wanted a pair of engines for a boat to take back the Water Speed Record from the British and their Rolls-Royce \\"R\\" aero V12 engines. Miller proposed a V16 like the 303, but much larger. Miller and Goossen designed the engine, while Ev Stevenson worked on the lubrication system and the cylinder heads. The engine was a four valve-per-cylinder DOHC V16 with a 54¬∞ angle between cylinder banks and one Schwitzer-Cummins supercharger per bank supplying air at . The original bore and stroke were , but Wood‚Äôs request for an even larger engine resulted in the bore being raised to for a final displacement of . Each engine developed approximately at 6000 rpm. The engines were installed in Wood's Miss America VIII. After failing to take the world record during an attempt on 25 October 1931, Wood sold the engines without the superchargers. Boat and engines were eventually reunited. After the 1931 Indy, Miller proposed building two copies of an advanced four-wheel drive car for the 1932 race as a promotional tool for the FWD Company of Clintonville, Wisconsin. Goossen contributed a new DOHC V8 engine with a 180¬∞ crankshaft, a split crankcase, and babbit main bearings with removable bearing caps. The cars appeared at Indy in 1932, one sponsored by the FWD Company, the other by William A. M. Burden, a descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Both cars retired. Prior to the 1932 Indy race Hartz had gone to Miller's revived racing shop asking for another increase in displacement. In March 1932 Goossen used the same methods he used to produce the 1930 152 engine to create a new straight-eight that displaced . A four- cylinder derivative of this engine was the basis of the Miller Midget engine. Miller and Goossen were invited to Burden's home to discuss a project for a unique road car. Burden and Victor Emanuel wanted Miller to build two copies of the most exclusive, highest performance road car of the time. Emanuel later dropped out of the project, so just a single copy was completed. The car was a long-nosed roadster with four-wheel drive and another V16 for an engine. Displacement was close to that of the earlier 303 engine, but the cylinder banks were separated by 45¬∞ in the Burden engine, and it was supercharged. Goossen estimated power to have been . Completion of the car was delayed by Miller's bankruptcy, but it was eventually delivered. Burden sold the car back to the factory for $600.00. On 8 July 1933 Miller's creditors filed an application for involuntary bankruptcy against Harry A. Miller Inc. Offenhauser's claims against Miller were settled in exchange for machine tools from Miller's Gramercy shop. Patterns for the Miller 220 engine also ended up with Offenhauser. Goossen never recovered his lost wages, forcing him and his wife to move out of their home to smaller accommodations. In 1933, at Offenhauser's request, Goossen extensively revised the 220 engine incorporating features from Miller's V16 and the Miller Midget engine that was essentially half of a Miller 183 straight eight, as well as ideas from other experimenters such as Art Sparks. For 1934 the engine was initially called the Miller/Offenhauser, but was renamed \\"Offenhauser\\" one year later. In 1937 the engine grew again, to . In the mid-1930s Preston Tucker began to promote the idea of a Ford flathead V8-powered Indianapolis racer to Ford. In February 1935 Ford accepted the idea. Tucker turned to Miller to design a modern chassis for the car. The cars would be front-wheel drive, using Ford flathead V8s with Bohnalite cylinder heads. Goossen contributed the design of a new transfer case for the front-wheel drive cars. Four cars appeared at Indianapolis on 12 May 1935, with Miller as the sponsor. None of the cars finished. Driver Wilbur Shaw asked Goossen to design a new car for the 1935 Indianapolis 500. The project was financed by Gil Pirrung. Construction took place over the winter of 1934/35 in the Los Angeles area. Goossen designed a front-wheel drive system that was both stronger and simpler than that used by Miller. The four cylinder, eight valve engine displaced , and was one of the first two engines officially called \\"Offenhauser\\". The car, called either the \\"Pirrung Special\\" or the \\"1935 Shaw Indy Special\\", appeared at Indy in 1935, where it finished second. In August 1936 Goossen was hired by Sparks to design a new inline six-cylinder engine incorporating Sparks' ideas for the Indianapolis 500. The engine, later known as the \\"Big Six\\", was a DOHC 2 valve-per-cylinder inline six that was fed by a centrifugal supercharger. It was manufactured by Offenhauser with final assembly by Sparks own people. It set fastest qualifying lap at Indianapolis in 1937, but retired due to supercharger problems. Goossen and Offenhauser were involved in a redesign of the clutch in the Thunderbolt land speed record car following a clutch failure during its 6 November 1937 run. The revised clutch was used for the car's record attempt on 19 November 1937. Owner/driver George Eyston set a new land speed mile record of and new kilometre record of that day. In 1938 the Bowes Seal Fast Special, also called the Stevens/Winfield Special, appeared at Indy. The car was built by Myron Stevens, with partners Louis Meyer, Al Jones, and Bob Bowes of the Bowes Seal Fast patch company. Jones and Meyer later dropped out of the project, although Meyer would drive the car at Indy in 1938 and 1939. With input from William Clement \\"Bud\\" Winfield, Goossen designed a supercharged DOHC straight-eight. There were two valves per cylinder, with an included angle of 84¬∞ degrees between them. The engine used torsion bars in the camshafts to both drive the supercharger and absorb shocks from changing drive loads. Goossen tried vane and Roots style superchargers before finally settling on a Miller centrifugal blower. After Meyer retired from racing, driver Rex Mays posted some good results with the car. In 1938 industrialist Lew Welch and Winfield embarked on a project to build a new V8 powered Indy car. Goossen worked on the engine, which was a DOHC V8. Cylinders and heads were cast en bloc in banks of four, with a larger separation between cylinders 2‚Äì3 than between 1‚Äì2 and 3‚Äì4. There was one intake and one exhaust valve in each hemispherical combustion chamber, with an 84¬∞ included angle between the valves. The cylinder banks were attached to an alloy barrel crankcase. The flat-plane crankshaft ran in three bearings. Engine bore was , and stroke was ; total displacement was . Induction was boosted by means of a centrifugal supercharger driven by straight-cut gears and running at 5.35 times engine rpm, delivering up to of boost. Since it was intended to be installed in a front-drive chassis, the camshaft drive was at the flywheel end of the engine, while the supercharger was mounted at the opposite end. Power output was estimated to have been . The engine first appeared at the 1941 Indianapolis 500 in a rebodied 1935 Miller-Ford front-wheel-drive chassis and renamed as another \\"Bowes Seal Fast Special\\". Driven by Ralph Hepburn, the car finished in fourth place. 1940s In 1943 Goossen designed the front-wheel drive transaxle for Lou Moore's Blue Crown Specials. At the 1946 Indy the V8 engine built for the 1941 race reappeared. Power was now up to . Goossen had designed a new front-wheel-drive chassis that was then built by Frank Kurtis. The car was called the Novi Governor Special, and its powerplant the Novi engine. The engine became famous for its distinctive sound. In 1946 Offenhauser sold his company to Lou Meyer and Dale Drake, who formed Meyer & Drake and continued production and development of the Offy engine. Leo Goossen stayed on with Meyer & Drake as Chief Engineer. 1950s Beginning in 1953, Goossen reengineered the Meyer & Drake engine to be mounted laid over to just 18¬∞ above horizontal to reduce the car's centre of gravity. This required many other changes, including a new crankcase and a new cover for the lower camshaft housing, among other things. Racing promoter and team owner J. C. Agajanian decided to develop an Indianapolis engine based on the Studebaker V8 stock block. He hired Goossen to design new cylinder heads, resulting in a set of DOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder. The Studebaker block was bored an additional to while the stock stroke of was retained on early engines, resulting in a displacement of . With a compression ratio of 12.8:1 suitable for methanol fuel and the addition of a dry-sump and Hilborn fuel injection, maximum power output was estimated to have been at 7200 rpm. For the 1955 Indianapolis 500 businessman and racing team owner Howard Keck hired Travers and Coon to develop an all new streamlined Indy car. Goossen was hired to designed the engine, which was to have been a V8. Keck terminated the project and withdrew from racing before the 1955 race. In 1938 Joe Lencki, mechanic, team owner and developer of Lenckite (later renamed zMAX microlubricant), went to Goossen to have an engine designed embodying some of Lencki's ideas. Goossen designed a DOHC inline six cylinder engine with two valves per cylinder in a hemispherical combustion chamber. The engine was built in the Offenhauser shop. At the 1939 Indianapolis this engine, in the Burd Piston Rings Special, retired due to a fuel pump failure. In 1940 Lencki went back to Goossen for a revised engine, one with a new cylinder head with four valves per cylinder in a pent-roof combustion chamber and a block that displaced . At that year's Indy the car retired with a thrown piston rod. In the late 1950s Goossen collaborated with Arnold Birner to develop a DOHC multivalve cylinder head for the four cylinder Pontiac Trophy 4 engine. Installed in a lakester owned by Julian Doty and built by August \\"Gus\\" Sommerfeld and Robert \\"Baldy\\" Baldwin of B and S Garage, the engine was first run in 1960. 1960s In the early 1960s, Goossen provided consulting services to Ford during the development of that manufacturer's Indy V8 DOHC racing engines. Meyer & Drake Offy engine serial number 215 was bought by Ford through their \\"Auto Lite\\" division on 31 August 1962 to study before designing their new DOHC Indy V8. It is believed to have influenced the Ford engine. While at Meyer & Drake Goossen mentored Ed Donovan, and also designed the original gear drives for Donovan's company. In June 1958 Lance Reventlow decided to build a Formula One car. The chassis was designed by young engineer Marshall Whitfield and built by Troutman and Barnes. Reventlow hired Goossen to design an engine specifically for the project, fabrication of which would be handled by Travers and Coon of Traco. An all new design, the Scarab F1 engine was an inline four cylinder engine, laid over to 11¬∞ from horizontal. The crankcase and cylinder block was one piece, cast in light alloy. The cylinders had press-in wet liners. Final bore and stroke were , resulting in a displacement of just over . The cylinder head was detachable. The engine was noteworthy for using desmodromic valve actuation for the two valves, set at an 84¬∞ included angle, in each cylinder's hemispherical combustion chamber. The desmodromic system was based on the one used by Mercedes Benz on their 300SLR, a car Traco had access to. Each cylinder had two sparkplugs. Power output was estimated to be in the range of . Two cars were tested at Riverside International Raceway before being sent to Europe for the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix. The cars' best finish was a tenth place at the 1960 US Grand Prix. In 1965 Lou Meyer sold his share of Meyer & Drake to become a distributor of the Ford Indy DOHC V8. Dale Drake reorganized as Drake Engineering. Goossen stayed with Drake as Chief Design Engineer. 1970s The final version of the Offy lineage that Goossen worked on was what became known as the Sparks-Goossen- Drake (SGD), an engine with displacement reduced to with the addition of turbocharging. He produced drawings for this revision during the winter of 1973‚Äì1974, delivering them shortly before his death in 1974. Over the course of his career Goossen is credited with designing twenty-four engines and half as many complete cars. It is said that he never attended a race. Personal life Goossen married Vera A. Babbs, a teacher, in 1929 at Coconino station, Arizona. Vera Goossen died on 18 February 1935, not long after the couple had adopted daughter Marilyn. In November 1974 Goossen suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. He died in Los Angeles, California on 4 December 1974.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a subset of the North Cascades. This remote mountain is situated north of Mazama, and northwest of Big Craggy Peak. It is set in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. Lost Peak ranks 62nd of Washington's highest 100 peaks, and 63rd on the \\"Bulger List\\". Precipitation runoff from Lost Peak drains into tributaries of Lost River, which in turn is part of the Methow River drainage basin. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Br√ºder Hollinek, 1980, , S. 198. The Mannesmann tower was a gift from the D√ºsseldorf-based Mannesmann AG to the Vienna Trade Fair and was realized under the direction of Josef Fr√∂hlich. It was built from seamless tubular steel. The manufacture of seamless steel tubes by rolling was a process developed by Mannesmann in 1885 and the term Mannesmann tube was synonymous with seamless steel tubes for many decades. Similar towers already existed in 1956 in Hanover (1954, 120 m), D√ºsseldorf (1954, 143 m), Sao Paulo (1954, 100 m) and other cities.Elektrotechnischer Verein √ñsterreichs, Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker, √ñsterreichischer Verband f√ºr Elektrotechnik (Hrsg.): E und M: Elektrotechnik und Maschinenbau. Band 74, Springer, 1957, S. 163. During the night the tower was illuminated with neon lamps. A corner junction was specially exhibited at the foot so that the connection between the individual pipes could be seen. When Mannesmann exhibited at a trade fair in the 1950s and 1960s, it had its stand by this tower. It served the cellular and non-public mobile land radio service, including the radio of the medical emergency service. At the end of the 1950s, thought was given to erecting a meteorological measuring point on the tower in order to record ground inversions, as it protruded just above the level of the factory chimneys.√ñsterreichische Gesellschaft f√ºr Meteorologie (Hrsg.): Wetter und Leben.

It is a second-generation message-passing system that was also used as the basis for several research projects, including robotic sensing and graphical workstation development. Harmony was actively developed throughout the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. History Harmony was a successor to the Thoth system developed at the University of Waterloo. Work on Harmony started at roughly the same time as that on the Verex kernel developed at the University of British Columbia. David Cheriton was involved in both Thoth and Verex, and would later go on to develop the V System at Stanford University. Harmony's principal developers included W. Morven Gentleman, Stephen A. MacKay, Darlene A. Stewart, and Meyt Wein. Early ports of the system existed for a variety of Motorola 68000-based computers, including ones using the VMEbus and Multibus backplanes and in particular the Multibus-based Chorus multiprocessor system at Waterloo. Other hosts included the Atari 520 or 1040 ST. A port also existed for the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX. Harmony was formally verified in 1995. Features Harmony was designed as a real-time operating system (RTOS) for robot control. It is a multitasking, multiprocessing system. It is not multi-user. Harmony provided a runtime environment only; development took place on a separate system, originally an Apple Macintosh. For each processor in the system, an image is created that combines Harmony with the single multitask program for that processor at link time, an exception being a case where the kernel is programmed into a ROM. Although the term did not appear in the original papers, Harmony was later referred to as a microkernel. A key in Harmony is its use of the term \\"task\\", which in Harmony is defined as the \\"unit of sequential and synchronous execution\\" and \\"the unit of resource ownership\\". It is likened to a subroutine, but one that must be explicitly created and which runs independently of the task that created it. Programs are made up of a number of tasks. A task is bound to a particular processor, which may be different from that of the instantiating task and which may host many tasks. All system resources are owned and managed by tasks. Intertask communication is primarily provided by synchronous message passing and four associated primitives. Shared memory is also supported. Destruction of a task closes all of its connections. Input/Output uses a stream model. Harmony is connection- oriented in that tasks that communicate with each other frequently maintain state information about each other. In contrast with some other distributed systems, connections in Harmony are inexpensive. Applications and tools An advanced debugger called Melody was developed for Harmony at the Advanced Real-Time Toolset Laboratory at Carleton University. It was later commercialized as Remedy. The Harmony kernel underpinned the Actra project ‚Äî a multiprocessing, multitasking Smalltalk. Harmony was used in the multitasking, multiprocessor Adagio robotics simulation workstation. Concepts from both Harmony and Adagio influenced the design of the Smalltalk-based Eva event driven user interface builder. Harmony was used as the underlying OS for several experimental robotic systems. Commercial Harmony was commercialized by the Taurus Computer Products division of Canadian industrial computer company Dy4. When Dy4 closed down their software division, four of Taurus' former developers founded Precise Software Technologies and continued developing the OS as Precise/MPX, the predecessor to their later Precise/MQX product. Another commercial operating system derived from Harmony is the Unison OS from Rowebot Research Inc.

Founded during World War I, Rabbi Shimon Shkop became rosh yeshiva in 1920.  Early Years The yeshiva was founded in either 1914 or 1916, formed with the enrollment of yeshiva students who were displaced from the ongoing World War I. Rabbi Refael Alter Shmuelevitz (father of Rabbi Chaim Shmuelevitz), was appointed as rosh yeshiva, and Rabbi Yosef Leib Nenedik was the yeshiva's first mashgiach ruchani. Rabbi Moshe Trop, (father of Rabbi Naftoli Trop), was also on the yeshiva's faculty.  Rabbi Shimon Shkop  Rabbi Shimon Shkop In 1920, at the urging of Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, as well as the encouragement of Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chofetz Chaim) and Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzenski, Rabbi Shimon Shkop became rosh yeshiva. Rabbi Shlomo Harkavy became mashgiach around that time too; as part of his job, he was supposed to give students mussar (rebuke) when they did something wrong. However, as opposed to directly approaching a student and rebuking him for a specific act, he would simply talk about that type of wrongdoing with another person while in earshot of the student. A son-in-law of Rabbi Shkop, Rabbi Shraga Feivel Hindis, assisted his father-in-law in running the yeshiva. The hasmadah (diligence in Torah study) in the yeshiva was well known, with the average student studying fifteen hours each day. The most diligent students were called the \\"Lions of Grodno\\" or in Yiddish, the \\"Ariyos fun Grodno\\"; they were capable of learning for eighteen hours a day. Among the \\"lions\\" were Moshe Zaretsky and Yisrael Zev Gustman, future rosh yeshiva in Ramailes. The two both used stay in the beis medrash (Torah study hall) for months, immersed in Torah learning. The yeshiva schedule was extremely rigorous with shacharis at seven o'clock in the morning and night seder (learning session) finishing at 1 AM. The yeshiva was divided into two schools: the yeshiva ketana for younger students and the yeshiva gedolah for older ones. Rabbi Chaim Shmuelevitz gave a shiur (class) in the yeshiva ketana. The rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Shkop gave shiur for the yeshiva gedolah. Rabbi Shkop's shiur would sometimes last over two hours long. Under his leadership, the yeshiva grew to over 200 students.  Disbandment and Legacy  Yeshiva Shaar HaTorah-Grodno in Queens, NY At the Soviet Occupation of Poland in 1939, the yeshiva disbanded and fled to Vilnius. Rabbi Shkop however wasn't healthy enough for the journey, and remained in Grodno, where he passed away soon after. The yeshiva was reestablished in Queens, New York and led by Rabbi Zelig Epstein, a grandson-in-law of Rabbi Shkop, under the same name, Yeshiva Shaar HaTorah. Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman opened another reestablishment of the yeshiva in Ashdod, Israel, as a branch of his Ponovezh Yeshiva.

On August 5, 2020 he was arrested in Espa√±ola, New Mexico after successfully evading law enforcement and living there for almost 47 years under the alias \\"Ramon C. Montoya\\".  Background  Archuleta was born in Brooklyn, New York. He worked as a barber before embarking on a life of crime, which included burglary, robbery, and drug trafficking in both Mexico and the United States. FBI Wanted Poster of Luis Archuleta, fbi.gov  Criminal history  in 1971, Archuleta shot a Denver Police Officer named Daril Cinquanta, then fled to Mexico, where he was arrested by federal officials for drug trafficking. Archuleta was then extradited to the U.S. to face trial in Colorado and was sentenced to serve 9 years in prison for the crime. He subsequently escaped from Colorado prison. Prior to this offense, Archuleta previously escaped from a California prison. In March of 1973, a Denver jury found him guilty of shooting Denver police officer Daril Cinquanta in the 4400 block of Mariposa Street. Archuleta escaped while undergoing exams at a state hospital in Pueblo, Colorado. He and three other inmates held several correctional officers at gunpoint with a .38 caliber handgun and then stole a vehicle and escaped custody. Two of the inmates who escaped with Archuleta were eventually caught but Archuleta evaded capture.  Living in New Mexico  After his successful escape from a Colorado prison, Archuleta settled in Espanola, New Mexico under the alias Ramon C. Montoya where he lived and evaded the authorities for 47 years. While living in New Mexico, Archuleta was arrested in 2011 for aggravated drunk driving and failure to stay in his lane in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. From that arrest, Law enforcement were able to provide Espanola police and the FBI with a photo, which eventually lead to Archuleta's capture. Daril Cinquanta, the police officer who was shot by Archuleta in 1971, and who was working as a private detective at the time, tracked Archuleta to Espanola, New Mexico after receiving an anonymous tip on June 24, 2020 that Archuleta was living there under the alias Ramon C. Montoya. Cinquanta discovered that ‚ÄúRamon Montoya‚Äù had been arrested in 2011 for a DWI in New Mexico. He subsequently contacted the Espa√±ola police, who notified the FBI of Archuleta's whereabouts. FBI agents arrested Luis Archuleta, whose real name is Larry Pusateri, at his home in Espa√±ola on Wednesday, August 5, 2020, after a coordinated investigation between the FBI and the Espa√±ola Police Department. Little is known about what Archuleta had been doing for nearly 50 years in Espa√±ola. Cinquanta said Archuleta had a fake Social Security card and a valid New Mexico driver‚Äôs license.

The radar is produced by Northrop Grumman. Design and development In the 1990s, Australia recognized a need for an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C;) aircraft. In 1996, Australia issued a request for proposal (RFP) for the aircraft for the RAAF under Project Wedgetail, referring to the Wedge- tailed eagle.\\"AIR 5077 - Project Wedgetail\\" . Defence Materiel Organisation In 1999, Australia awarded Boeing Integrated Defense Systems a contract to supply four AEW&C; aircraft with options for three additional aircraft. The L band (1 to 2 GHz) electronically scanned AEW and surveillance radar is located on a dorsal fin on top of the fuselage, dubbed the \\"top hat\\", and is designed for minimal aerodynamic effect. The radar is capable of simultaneous air and sea search, fighter control and area search, with a maximum range of over 600 km (look-up mode). When operating in look-down mode against fighter-sized target, the maximum range is in excess of 370 km. When used against maritime targets, the maximum range is over 240 km for frigate-sized targets. MESA is capable of simultaneously tracking 180 targets and conducting 24 intercepts. In addition, the radar antenna array is also doubled as an ELINT array, with a maximum range of over 850 km at altitude. The 10.8 m long by 3.4 m high antenna assembly incorporates 7.3 m long by 2.7 m high Side-Emitting Electronic Manifold array, with the top hat supporting array providing 120¬∞ coverage on port and starboard side, while the top hat array itself provides 60¬∞ fore and aft, thus providing a complete 360¬∞ coverage. The radar's beam can be set for a 2¬∞ to 8¬∞ width, while scan duration can be set from 3 s to 40 s. Radar signal processing equipment and central computer are installed directly below the antenna array. The cabin features eight operator consoles with sufficient space for four more; the Australian fleet will operate ten consoles with space for two more (four on starboard side and six on the port side).

It is about north of Beirut. Akkar al-Atika contains the 11th-century fortress of Gibelacar (Hisn Ibn Akkar in Arabic), which was utilized by the Crusaders and became the headquarters of the Sayfa clan, whose members were chieftains and Ottoman governors of Tripoli and its districts in from the late 16th until the mid-17th centuries. The village had a estimated population of 17,000 living in about 3,550 houses in 2011. Its inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. The average elevation of Akkar al-Atika is above sea level and the village has a total land area of 2,838 hectares. Most of the village's labor force, who form about a third of the population, mainly work in the military or education sector with about 10% deriving their main income from permanent or seasonal agriculture. Nonetheless, agriculture constitutes as a supplementary income for much of the population. The relatively large role it plays in the village stems from its abundance of cultivable land; most of the village's households own at least a tract of agricultural land or work in it. The principal crops grown apples, walnuts, peaches, persimmon, olives and tomatoes and the main agricultural products are apple cider and vinegar, fruit jams, chickens, milk and cheeses. Much of Akkar al-Atika's agricultural output is sold in the markets of Tripoli and the governorate capital of Halba. Akkar al-Atika has abundant forest lands, though over half of its forests were destroyed between 2000 and 2010 due to fires, woodcutting and conversion of the lands for agricultural use.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a subset of the North Cascades. This remote mountain is situated on Isabella Ridge, north- northeast of Mazama, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Big Craggy Peak, to the north. Precipitation runoff from Sherman drains into tributaries of the Methow River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for visiting this area, however, smoke from distant wildfires may potentially reduce visibility, and smoky summer conditions have been increasing with climate change.https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/jun/05/wildfires-signal-climate/ Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The incident was described by the media amongst biggest massacre in the history of Bihar in which 42 members of the Rajput caste were slaughtered. However the exact figure of casualties is disputed with some sources claiming death tolls to be as higher as 56. Background The Aurangabad district which is also known as \\"Mini Chittorgarh\\" of Bihar due to presence of significant Rajput population was not different from any other part of the backward state.Here the feudalism of the worst kind prevailed in which a few notable person had control over vast swathes of land while others even lacked a proper shirt on their body as described in a report of \\"India Today\\". The twin village of Dalelchak and Bhagaura contained several castes but most of the land in surrounding region was owned by Bodhgaya mahant and few landlords.The Yadav people of the village where in long drawn conflict with the Rajputs over the control of a large area of government land. In these conflicts several small scale killings and counter killings had occurred in the past.The notable among them was of \\"Anjan\\" village, where Maoist Communist Centre(MCC), an extremist organisation dominated by Yadavs killed a Rajput landlord.In the vendetta the Rajputs hit back by killing 7 Yadavs in \\"Chhechani\\" village. The action of Rajputs was a result of the notification issued by \\"Krantikari Kisan Committee\\", a communist organisation dominated by backward castes which banned the sale of hundreds of acre of land belonging to \\"Mahant\\", which was not liked by the Rajputs. A landlord Babu Lootan Singh showed valour by buying the land but ended up putting a challenge to the armed cadres of MCC dominated by Yadavs. The killings at \\"Parasdih\\" and revenge killing of 11 Rajputs at \\"Darmia\\" village also served as a propellent to this incident which took place in Dalelchak- Bhagaura. The Bihar was ruled at this time by Bindeshwari Dubey led Congress government and the tug of war between \\"upper castes\\" and backwards for political and economic dominance was on peak. Killing pattern According to the media reports framed by the account of spectators, a band of 300-400 armed man rushed towards the village in the darkness of night. It was also witnessed that, those who were in feud with the Rajputs of the village over the land were pointing towards the houses to be attacked.Earlier, a Rajput landlord of the village who was also a member of Chandra Shekhar's Janata Party had bought 40 acres of disputed land from the \\"Mahant\\" and had displaced the sharecroppers forcibly providing a solid cause for the MCC to come in picture, because of their hatred towards capitalism and the feudalism. The killing began with the men shot dead outside the houses.Some of them were killed while they were attempting to flee.The killers then entered the house and women members of the community were caught , their heads were put upon an improvised chopping block and were beheaded with local made axes. After the mass killing took place, the attackers lighted all the houses belonging to Rajputs and the corpse were thrown into the fire emerging out of the burning houses. There were houses of other castes too but none came to help the victims. The intelligence network at Patna had given signals of possible vendetta on the part of Yadavs after the Chhechani and patrol units were alerted near the vulnerable villages but afterall nothing could stop the lynching party from committing mass murders. According to Ram Deen Singh, a victim of the incident: While hiding in his haystack, Amresh Singh of Dalelchak heard the killer mob shout: Later, a Times of India report covered the ground situation of the village in aftermath of the carnage as well as the failure of government to deal with the plight of victims.Though Chief Minister Bindeshwari Dubey paid a visit to the village, nothing more was done to ward off the fears from the mind of the affected families and to end the cause of disputes which had the potential to bring more cases of inter-caste conflicts in the future between the two communities.According to another victim Vinay Singh: According to the same report, Vinay was not the only person to bear this pain. When TOI reached the village, Chandra Devi (80) was present in the village. She still remembers the gory scene. Consequences As a result of this ghastly incident, a total of 40 Rajput family fled the village.According to Vinay Singh, a native of village who survived the carnage and owned \\"25 bigha\\" of land in the village, he never wants to return to the village but visits infrequently bacause of his mother who has close attachment to her ancestral village and the home. Those who lost their kins were given only government job in the name of compensation, like Singh received a job after losing 20 members of his family. Conviction In December 1992, eight of the accused in the massacre were sentenced to death by the Aurangabad Additional Sessions Court.

That burgess was William Sharpe (Sharp), as stated by McCartney with citations.  Controversies  McCartney states that Sharpe's superiors discussed remarks he made while inebriated which complained about a government decision that gave the right to trade with incoming ships to official merchants to the exclusion of that right for individual plantations. Sharpe and three others also lost a suit to Richard Taylor in January 1629 in which Taylor accused the men of preventing him from using land for which he held a patent from Governor George Yeardley.McCartney, 2007, pp. 632, 685.  Burgess  In 1629, William Sharpe represented Charles City (sometimes referred to as Bermuda City) in the Virginia House of Burgesses.  Wife and property  Records showed that William Sharpe and his wife Elizabeth were living at Bermuda Hundred Plantation on February 16, 1624 and were still there on January 20, 1625 with their sons, Samuell, age 2, and Isack, age 2 months.McCartney, 2007, 631-632. In a list of patented land sent to England in 1625, Sharpe was shown with 40 acres in Charles City, the location of Bermuda Hundred.  Elizabeth Sharpe (Sharp; Packer; Baugh)  Elizabeth Sharpe, not to be confused with Elizabeth Sharpe the wife of Samuel Sharpe, went to Virginia in August 1620 on the Francis Bonaventure.McCartney, 2007, p. 632. On February 12, 1635, Elizabeth, identifying herself as William Sharpe's widow, patented land in the Varina area of Henrico County, just east of Henricus Island, on the basis of headrights.McCartney, 2007, pp. 529, 632. By this date, Elizabeth had married Thomas Packer (Parker?), and they enlarged their land holdings.McCartney, 2007, p. 529. After the death of Thomas Packer, no later than July 12, 1636, Elizabeth married William Baugh of London, who went to Virginia prior to June 5, 1639.McCartney, 2007, pp. 120, 632. Elizabeth died prior to February 1, 1651.McCartney, 2007, p. 120.  Death  William Sharpe died after October 1629 but before February 12, 1635 when his widow, Elizabeth, who identified herself as William Sharpe's widow, patented land in the Varina area of Henrico County, just east of Henricus Island, on the basis of headrights.McCartney, 2007, pp. 529, 632.

It was first published in 1878 as The Mataura Ensign and changed to its current name in 1973. The newspaper features coverage of local government, sports and recreation, arts and entertainment, education, farming and business news. It is currently distributed to approximately 12,000 homes over a circulation area that includes Gore and the surrounding area that stretches from Mandeville and Waikaka in the north to Mataura in the south. History=Founding The Mataura Ensign began publication in Gore (in Southland) on 10 May 1878 , operating out of a hut located beside the shop of Thomson and Beattie. Its full title was The Mataura Ensign, Southlander, and Southern Free Press, Mataura Valley, Gore, Mataura Bridge, Edendale, Woodlands, Wyndham, Toi Tois, Waimea, Otaria, Clinton, Tapanui, Popotunoa, Waiwera, Waikaka, Otamete, Waikaia, Switzers, Riversdale, Nokomai, Kingston, Winton, Invercargill, Bluff, and Riverton Reporter and Advertiser. It was established by Joseph Mackay who owned the Bruce Herald in Milton at the time. Mackay, a Dunedin bookseller and maker of almanacs, was known as a ‚Äúrag-planter‚Äù, which was a New Zealand newspaper phenomenon which lasted until the early 1920 whereby enterprising entrepreneurs having identified a growing settlement, would bring in a printing plant and editor, publish several issues of their newspaper often offering cheap advertising rates and then advertise the business for lease or to sale (often to an existing rival). ‚ÄúRag-planters‚Äù tended to favour establishing their newspapers in the months leading up to a general elections. The ‚ÄúMataura‚Äù in the title comes from the locality, while the ‚ÄúEnsign‚Äù is sourced from the Scottish newspaper, the Northern Ensign. The paper's name was suggested by Mackay's local business partner/editor George Renner, after the Scottish newspaper the Northern Ensign. Renner and his partner James Sinclair canvassed the district for subscribers and advertisers. Mackay was also a pioneer of the ‚Äúchain newspaper‚Äù concept in New Zealand where a small regional newspaper was owned or linked to a larger newspaper from which they sourced a large part of their content. This was reflected in that ten of the twelve weekly pages of the early editions of The Mataura Ensign were directly sourced from the Bruce Herald with the other two being produced locally by George Renner. The pages were printed for the proprietor in Gore by Henry Hughes. This transfer of content was undertaken by shipping the typesetting from town to town for reprinting. The Mataura Ensign was initially published once a week. Mackay was subsequently forced by financial difficulties to sell the newspaper to F. S. Canning on 4 April 1879. Mackay went on to establish the Southern Free Press and Mataura Herald in 1882 (often referred to as just the Southern Press) which was printed at Gore, Invercargill Mataura and Wyndham but this paper failed to compete with existing newspapers and was sold after eight months and incorporated into The Mataura Ensign. Renner was succeeded as editor by Henderson Carrick. Later owing to a difference of opinion of the relative importance of proprietor and editor, Carrick left. Canning on 1 April 1881 took in J. G. Souness and a Mr Green as partners. From 1881 the newspaper was published twice weekly. Carrick's place was filled by J. Whitely King. Canning retired from the firm, with Green and Souness carrying on the business for another 16 months. Purchase by Alfred Dolamore Experienced Milton newspaper publisher Alfred Dolamore (1858-1895) bought the newspaper from Green and Sourness on 1 August 1882. Dolamore had previous experience on the Nelson Evening Mail and The Southland Times. The Mataura Ensign expanded rapidly under Dolamore and he took on Alfred George Benson Godby in July 1887 as a partner, until upon Godby retiring from the partnership in 1891, Dolamore‚Äôs brother J. Howard Dolamore (1869-1947) joined him in the partnership. Godby subsequently accidentally killed himself at the age of 38 in 1896 while trying to shoot a cat. Under the partners the newspaper moved into larger premises and increased its circulation area. Competition As the better-capitalized business grew it absorbed in addition to the ‚ÄúSouthern Free Press and Mataura Herald‚Äù, the small rural weekly The Waikaia Herald in April 1883 (which was first published at Waikaia for the Switzers goldfield on 13 January 1882), The Waimea Plains Review in 1896 (which was first published at Riversdale in 1892 by a stock and station agency ), and in mid-1897 The Clutha County Gazette (which was published at Clinton). More serious competition arrived for the newspaper when the Southern Standard began publication in 14 June 1887. When news reached the owners of The Mataura Ensign that William J. Marsh who had previously owned the Lake Country Press was intending to publish a newspaper in the town of Wyndham, something that could result in loss of circulation in their area they decided to combat it by producing their own rival. They dispatched Ewen Greville Macpherson (1863- ) to the town to produce The Wyndham Farmer, which was published on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings, starting on 1 July 1895. Marsh‚Äôs rival, The Wyndham Herald which appeared on 3 July of that same year was also a tri- weekly and was published for the new 40 years. Eventually both newspapers were published twice weekly. The Wyndham Farmer was sold on 1 January 1898 to Macpherson, who together with his son published the newspaper for new 50 years. Under the Dolamore's stewardship The Mataura Ensign retained a strong literary flavour, claiming amongst its staff the noted historian James Herries Beattie (1881-1972). He compiled extensive files on the history of Southland through oral interviews and correspondence. The newspaper began to intermittently feature a ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs corner‚Äù from the mid-1890s. From 1899 under the by-line of \\"Uncle Phil\\", William Gilchrist, headmaster of East Gore School, wrote a column for many years, those intention was to nurture the writing skills of children. When Alfred Dolamore died in 1895 control of the business passed to his brother J. Howard Dolamore. After a disastrous fire on 21 June 1898 which destroyed everything except the printing machine, the newspaper moved from Gorton Street to new premises in Mersey Street, Gore. In 1901 George James Anderson became part-owner and business manager of the newspaper and was editor from 1908 until he entered politics. The newspaper changed from a tri-weekly to a daily on 2 April 1906. The Southern Standard changed its name in 1906 to the Gore Standard, to reflect that it was changing to a daily morning newspaper. In 1908 the Gore Standard and The Mataura Ensign both came under the ownership of newly formed The Gore Printing and Publishing Co. After having reverted to a tri-weekly publication of the Gore Standard ceased in 1910 as a result of being incorporated into its sister publication. The newspaper changed its name to the Ensign in 1973.. Editors Among the editors have been J. Mackay, George Renner, Henderson Carrick, J. Whitely King, J. G. Scoular, Alfred Dolamore, G. S. Searle, A. G. B. Godby, F. H. Hart, George James Anderson and John Findlay McArthur.

The Village, as the residents call it, although run according to some of the same rules as a homeless shelter, is community-led and intends to foster a safe environment through community for children and families who would otherwise struggle against addiction, medical issues, homelessness, or a combination of the three. In response to local complaints and state announcements of plans to clear the encampment, the leadership of Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae decided to move to a private plot of agricultural land and set up a new kauhale (homestead) village featuring permanent tiny homes, running water, electricity, farming, and communal kitchens and bathrooms. After 2 years of fundraising, Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae was able to purchase a 20-acre plot of land in February 2020 and has started construction of the communal facilities.  The Village  Twinkle Borge was living among the homeless at the Wai'anae Boat Harbor in the mid 2000‚Äôs when she remarked that the existing atmosphere was not ideal for the children and families among them. She assembled a like- minded group and founded Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae with the following rules: \\"no sex offenders, no drugs, no stealing,\\" and quiet hours after 8 pm. With the help of appointed \\"block captains,\\" Borge‚Äôs mostly female team enforces the rules with spoken and written warnings, and then, in the worst case, eviction. During the first decade of its existence, The Village has remained mostly the same: each dwelling is either a tent or assembled from found materials and there is no electricity or running water. When a newcomer arrives, one of the block captains will take them on a tour of the village before assigning them a plot and offering essentials such as bedding and food, if needed.  Culture  Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae creates a sense of community through shared responsibility and collective care. Older children look after the younger children and all residents must refrain from stealing and drugs and observe quiet hours after 8 pm. The central area of the village is the social area where adults come to relax and talk story. The residents call themselves 'houseless' rather than 'homeless', since they feel that they have found a home in the community of Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae. Plans for the future village include food programs and other benefits that The Village will offer to members of the surrounding neighborhoods as well.  Demographics  Out of the 200 or so residents, 2/3rd of the residents are Native Hawaiian and there are 18 families with children.  Permanent Location  In February 2020, Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae was able to purchase 20 acres of land for their permanent village. Contributors to the fundraiser include: Alexander & Baldwin, Henry and Colene Wong Foundation, Island Insurance Foundation, Nareit Foundation, Pyramid Insurance Centre Ltd., and Group 70 International Inc. Borge says they must finish construction before any residents can move in. Electricity and plumbing have been installed and the next priority is to build the communal bathrooms and kitchens. The new village will house 250 residents and cost of rent and amenities will total to $200-250 per month per family.  Criticism  Throughout the years, the state government has threatened sweeps, or clearing, of The Village due to local complaints and environmental concerns. The neighboring communities blamed excessive water usage, garbage buildup, and vandalism on the large homeless community, as well claiming that certain burglaries traced back to \\"people [...] from that area, boat harbor.\\" Another reason The Department of Land and Natural Resources gave for a sweep was that The Village sits above the habitat of a rare local breed of shrimp, the opae ula, as well as an ancient burial ground. In response to the complaints and the DLNR, Borge says that she offered to pay for water usage and asked how the residents of Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae could better care for the shrimp populations. In March 2018, after warning of a sweep, Borge requested a private meeting with Governor David Ige, and he agreed. After speaking for 2 hours, during which Borge tried to convey that Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae was not like other homeless encampments, Governor Ige announced that there would be no sweep and we would work with Borge and the leaders of The Village to find another solution. Both the governor and Mayor of Honolulu Kirk Caldwell are supportive of the plan for Pu'uhonua o Wai'anae to move and transition to a permanent agri-village. Residents of the nearby Piliuka Homes have mixed reactions to their future neighbors.

Barrett has stated that he feels journalists should be held less responsible for stories that turn out to be false. During August 2020, Barrett became involved in the Mitch Cleary controversy when he voiced his opinion that the AFL made the right move by standing down fellow journalist Mitch Cleary, at odds with the majority opinion of the AFL community. This opinion was criticized by former AFL player Tim Watson, and Barrett responded by questioning Watson's understanding of journalism, and bringing up the Essendon Football Club supplements saga.

A robber and burglar, Warren was convicted for the 1979 double murder of a couple in Brookings, Oregon and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to two life imprisonment terms, which he served until his death in 2003. Five years later, he would be linked an unsolved 1976 Portland murder which, at the time, was the oldest solved cold case in the state's history. Early life and crimes Little is known about Warren's upbringing. Hailing from Brookings, he was the older of two siblings. His first recorded crime occurred in January 1972, when he robbed a convenience store in Portland. Edward was imprisoned for the crime, but managed to escape within the next year and travel to Salem. There, he broke into the house of a local woman, tying her up at gunpoint and stealing her car, before being quickly reapprehended. Between December 1973 and March 24, 1976, he remained behind bars. Murders=Rosa Cinnamon On the morning of March 24, 1976, Warren was paroled and hitched a ride to Portland, where he was required to check in with his parole officer. During the visit, he claimed that he planned to study at Portland Community College and to live at a residence hotel in the northern part of the city. At some point during the night, Warren was presumably looking for a place to burgle, before picking the apartment of 80-year-old Dayton native Rosa Cinnamon as his target. He kicked the door in, and started fighting with the elderly woman, receiving several scratches from the ordeal. Despite her efforts, Rosa was overpowered, beaten and finally strangled to death. Her lifeless body was found the next day, but since no suspect could be located, the quickly went cold, and would remain that way for three decades. Ricky Hemphill and Charla Toma On September 9, 1979, the body of 19-year-old Coast Guard petty officer Ricky Dale Hemphill was found at a gravel bar near the Chetco River, about 16 miles east of Brookings. Originally from Riverside, California, Hemphill was stationed in Brookings as a boatswain's third mate, and was last seen in his pickup truck with his 18-year-old girlfriend Charla Toma, of Lincoln City. He had been shot twice in the back. About 24 miles upstream, another body was found, later determined to be that of Toma. The next day, officers conducting a routine traffic stop in Port Orford stopped a vehicle occupied by three men: 26-year-old Edward Delon Warren, 34-year-old George Rose and another man who was never identified. Suddenly, Warren and Rose dashed into the woods, leaving the third occupant behind. After an hour being chased by police bloodhounds, the two men were captured. Warren was detained as a suspect in the Brookings murders, while Rose was returned to the Tillamook Forestry Camp, where he was serving a sentence for first-degree robbery and attempted assault. Trial, imprisonment and death At his February 1980 trial for the Hemphill-Toma murders, Warren claimed that a profane remark from the officer resulted in his shooting. After the fact, he ordered Charla to drive in Ricky's pickup truck up the Chetco River, and after a short walk through the woods, he shot her in the back three times and left. Pleading guilty to the murders, Justice Frederick Starkweather, Jr. sentenced Warren to death, citing his belief that the defendant was a violent criminal who posed a danger to society. At a later point, the sentence was commuted by the Oregon Supreme Court, and Warren was given two life terms. He spent the rest of his life in prison, with his DNA entered into the national database in 1999. In 2003, Warren died inside a Salem prison hospital from respiratory failure. In 2009, 33 years after Rosa Cinnamon's brutal murder, the Portland Police Department announced that Edward Delon Warren was linked to the killings via his DNA, which was found under the victim's fingernails. At the time of this discovery, the case was the oldest solved case in state history.

Formally, it is the triazido derivative of borane and is a covalent inorganic azide. The high- energy compound, which has the propensity to undergo spontaneous explosive decomposition, was first described in 1954 by Egon Wiberg and Horst Michaud of the University of Munich.  Preparation  The first method is by the addition of diborane to a solution of hydrazoic acid in diethyl ether at a temperature range between ‚àí20 ¬∞C and ‚àí10 ¬∞C. This synthesis proceeds via the intermediates monoazidoborane, BH2N3, and diazidoborane, BH(N3)2. : B2H6 \\\\+ 6 HN3 ‚Üí 2 B(N3)3 \\\\+ 6 H2 The compound can also be obtained by passing boron tribromide vapor over solid silver azide in high vacuum. : BBr3 \\\\+ 3 AgN3 ‚Üí B(N3)3 \\\\+ 3 AgBr A similar gas-phase synthesis uses the spontaneous reaction of boron trichloride with hydrazoic acid. : BCl3 \\\\+ 3 HN3 ‚Üí B(N3)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl  Properties  The compound forms colorless crystals that are only stable at low temperatures. Above ‚àí35 ¬∞C, an explosive decomposition may occur. In the gas phase, generated boron triazide decomposes at room temperature within 60 minutes via loss of nitrogen gas to form boron nitrides with formulas BN3 and BN. These reactions can also be initiated photochemically by UV radiation in the compounds absorption range at about 230 nm. : B(N3)3 ‚Üí BN3 \\\\+ 3 N2 : B(N3)3 ‚Üí BN + 4 N2 In contact with water, it undergoes hydrolysis to hydrazoic acid and boron trioxide. : 2 B(N3)3 \\\\+ 3 H2O ‚Üí 6 HN3 \\\\+ B2O3 Reaction with other azides like sodium azide or lithium azide yields the corresponding tetraazidoborate complexes. : B(N3)3 \\\\+ NaN3 ‚Üí NaB(N3)4 : B(N3)3 \\\\+ LiN3 ‚Üí LiB(N3)4 The parent tetraazidoboric acid, HB(N3)4, can be obtained at temperatures lower than ‚àí60 ¬∞C.  Uses  Due to the low stability, the compound itself is not used as a high-energy substance. However, the tetraazidoborate derivatives and adducts with bases such as quinoline, pyrazine or 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine have potential for this usage. The gas-phase decomposition of the compound is also of interest as a method of coating surfaces with boron nitride.

It starts with the first report of a new type of upper-respiratory tract disease among chickens in North Dakota, US, in 1931. The causative agent was identified as a virus in 1933. By 1936, the disease and the virus were recognised as unique from other viral disease. The became known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), but later officially renamed as Avian coronavirus. A new brain disease of mice (murine encephalomyelitis) was discovered in 1947 at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The virus causing the disease was called JHM (after Harvard pathologist John Howard Mueller). Three years later a new mouse hepatitis was reported from the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The causative virus was identified as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In 1961, a virus was obtained from a school boy in Epsom, England, who was suffering from common cold. The sample designated B814 was confirmed as novel virus in 1965. New common cold viruses (assigned 229E) collected from medical students at the University of Chicago were also reported in 1966. Structural analyses of IBV, MHV, B18 and 229E using transmission electron microscopy revealed that they all belong to the same group of viruses. Making a crucial comparison in 1967, June Almeida and David Tyrrell invented the collective name coronavirus, as all those viruses were characterised by solar corona-like projections (called spikes) on their surfaces. Other coronaviruses have been discovered from pigs, dogs, cats, rodents, cows, horses, camels, Beluga whales, birds and bats. As of 2020, 39 species are described. Bats are found to be the richest source of different species of coronaviruses. All coronaviruses originated from a common ancestor about 293 million years ago. Zoonotic species such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-C0V), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome- related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged during the past two decades and caused the first pandemics of the 21st century.  Discovery of chicken coronavirus  Electron microscopic image of Avian coronavirus. Arthur Frederick Schalk and Merle C. Fawn at the North Dakota Agricultural College were the first to report what was later identified as coronavirus disease in chickens. Their publication in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in 1931 indicates that there was a new respiratory disease that mostly affected 2-day-old to 3-week-old chickens. They referred to the disease as \\"an apparently new respiratory disease of baby chicks.\\" The symptoms included severe shortness of breath and physical weakness. The infection was contagious and virulent. It was easily transmitted through direct contact between chickens or experimental transfer of the bronchial exudates from infected to healthy chickens. Maximum mortality recorded was 90%. The causative pathogen was not known. Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station in New Brunswick, Canada, put forth a hypothesis in 1932 that virus could be the cause and introduced the name as \\"virus of the infectious bronchitis.\\" But this was a misattribution because at the time another related disease, known as infectious laryngotracheitis, was reported that exhibited almost similar symptoms but mostly affected adult chickens. As Beaudette later recalled in 1937, the disease he described was infectious layngotracheitis, saying: \\"Infectious laryngotracheitis is said to be the correct name for this disease rather than infectious bronchitis‚Ä¶ Moreover, the gasping symptom ordinarily accepted as typical of the disease is also a prominent symptom in infectious bronchitis (gasping disease, chick bronchitis).\\" The names infectious bronchitis and infectious laryngotracheitis were till then used synonymously and interchangably. Unaware of the developments, Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly at the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station studied a similar case which they called \\"gasping disease\\" due to the apparent symptom. They had known the disease since 1928. Their report in 1933 titled \\"Laryngotracheitis in chicks\\" published in the Poultry Science indicated a clear distinction of infectious bronchitis from infectious laryngotracheitis as the main organ affected was the bronchi. The bronchi infection resulted in severe gasping and swift death due to inability to eat food. It was also found that the pathogens could not be bacteria or protozoans as they passed through membranes (Berkefield filter) that would block those pathogens. The isolation and identification of the pathogen as a virus was reported as: > In several experiments we have reproduced the disease in chicks by the > intratracheal, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection of Berkefeld > filtered material. The chicks developed typical gasping symptoms after > various periods of incubation, different groups of chicks first showing > symptoms in six, seventeen, nineteen, etc., days after receiving the > filtrate... The disease may also be transferred by means of filtrates of > spleen, liver, and kidney tissues and by the transfer of bacteriologically > sterile blood. This was the discovery of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). But Bushnell and Brandy made an erroneous remark by saying, \\"The symptoms and lesions in the chicks [caused by IBV] are similar to those seen in so-called laryngotracheitis of adult birds and are probably due to the same agent.\\" In 1936, Jerry Raymond Beach and Oscar William Schalm at the University of California, Berkeley, reexamined Bushnell and Brady's experiment with a conclusion that infectious laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis with their causative viruses were different. (Beach had discovered infectious laryngotracheitis virus in 1931.) They concluded that: > *It was found that chickens that recovered from an infection with one of the > two strains of virus were refractory to further infection with either > strain. It was also found that the sera from chickens that have recovered > from an infection with one strain of the virus would neutralize virus of > either strain. These results show the identity of the two strains of virus. > *Chickens refractory to infection with this virus were shown to be > susceptible to the virus of laryngotracheitis. Likewise, chickens refractory > to the latter virus were susceptible to the former. These results > demonstrate that the two viruses are distinct from one another. Hudson and Beaudette later in 1937 were able to culture IBV for the first time using chicken embryos. This specimen, known as the Beaudette strain, became the first coronavirus to have its genome completely sequenced in 1987.  Discovery of mouse coronaviruses  Francis Sargent Cheevers, Joan B. Daniels, Alwin M. Pappenheimer and Orville T. Bailey investigated the case of brain disease (murine encephalitis) at the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology of Harvard Medical School in Boston in 1949. Two laboratory mice (Schwenktker strains) of 17 and 18 days old had flaccid paralysis and died. By then it was known that murine encephalitis was caused by a picornavirus, called Theiler's virus, which was discovered by Max Theiler at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York in 1937. But the Harvard scientists found that the two mice had unusual symptoms other than brain damage (demyelination). The mice had no visible illness or diarrhoea, which usually are associated with murine encephalitis. In addition, the causative virus was isolated from different organs including liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. This indicated that brain was not the primary target organ. Liver was particularly affected with severe necrosis, indicating hepatitis. The new virus was named JHM, after the initials of John Howard Mueller. In the autumn of 1950 there was a sudden outbreak of fatal hepatitis among laboratory mice (Parkes or P strains) at the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London. Alan Watson Gledhill and Christopher Howard Andrewes isolated the causative virus, which experimentally was highly infectious to healthy mice. They named the virus as \\"mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).\\" Gledhill called the experiments on the highly infectious nature of the virus as a \\"bizarre discovery\\". John A. Morris at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, discovered a new mouse virus, named H747, in 1959 from samples in Japan. When he compared the virus with JHM and MHV using serological tests he found that they were both antigenically related, upon which he created a common name as \\"hepatoencephalitis group of murine viruses.\\"  Discovery of human coronaviruses  Human coronaviruses were discovered as one of the many causative viruses of common cold. Research on the study of common cold originated when the British Medical Research Council and the Ministry of Health established the Common Cold Research Unit (CCRU) at Salisbury in 1946. Directed by Andrewes, the research laboratory discovered several viruses such as influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses and rhinoviruses that cause common cold. David Arthur John Tyrrell joined CCRU in 1957 and succeeded Andrewes in 1962. He developed a technique for growing rhinoviruses using nasal epithelial cells for the first time in 1960. His team soon after developed a concept of broad categorisation of common cold viruses into two groups: one group, called H strain, could be maintained only in human-embryo-kidney cell culture, and another group, designated M strain, could be maintained both in human-embryo-kidney cell culture and monkey- embryo-kidney cell culture. By then many common cold viruses could be grown in either of these cell cultures and were accordingly classified as M or H strain. During 1960-1961, Tyrrell's team collected throat swabs from 170 school boys having common cold at a boarding school in Epsom, Surrey. England. Among few samples that could not be cultured in any of the culture media, a specimen designated B814, collected on 17 February 1961, was particularly infectious among healthy volunteers. There was no evidence whether the pathogen in B814 was a bacterium or a virus as all bacterial and viral culture methods available showed negative results. It could only be maintained in human tracheal culture and experimentally passed on to healthy volunteers by nasal inoculation. In 1965, they were able to confirm that the pathogen was a filter-passing virus, susceptible to ether treatment (indicating a lipid envelope of the virus), able to induce cold in antibiotic-treated volunteers (indicating it was not a bacterium), and cultured in human-embryo-trachea epithelial cell culture. Serological tests (antigen-antibody reactions) further indicated that the virus was not related (not reactive) to antibodies (serotypes) of any known viruses at the time. Reporting in the British Medical Journal, Tyrrell and Malcolm L. Bynoe wrote their conclusion as: > After considerable initial doubts we now believe that the B814 strain is a > virus virtually unrelated to any other known virus of the human respiratory > tract, although, since it is ether-labile, it may be a myxovirus. But they contradicted themselves regarding the identity of the virus as they mentioned in the experimental results, saying: > It was concluded that B814 did not belong to any of the serotypes of > myxovirus used, but might be distantly related to influenza C or Sendai > viruses. In an independent research in US, Dorothy Hamre and John J. Procknow studied respiratory tract infection among medical students at the University of Chicago. In 1962, they obtained five samples that were associated with very different symptoms, causing mild cold only, and could be cultured only in secondary human kidney tissue in contrast to other cold viruses which could be maintained in monkey-embryo-kidney cell culture. Serological test indicated they were not myxoviruses (Orthomyxoviridae). They presented their discovery as \\"A new virus isolated from the human respiratory tract\\" in the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine in 1966. They further studied one sample, designated 229E, grown in human diploid cell culture (Wi-38) and described its developmental stages using transmission electron microscopy to show that it was new type of virus.  Discovery of the structure  Structural model of a coronavirus Viruses cannot be seen normally with light microscopes. It was only with the development of electron microscopy that viruses could be visualised and structurally elucidated. Reginald L. Reagan, Jean E. Hauser, Mary G. Lillie, and Arthur H. Craige Jr. of the University of Maryland were the first to describe the structure of coronavirus using the transmission electron microscopy. In 1948, they reported in The Cornell Veterinarian that IBV was spherical in shape and some of them had filamentous projections. But the images were difficult to interpret due to poor resolution and low magnification (at √ó 28,000). Their subsequent studies did not show any striking properties from other viruses. An important advancement was made by Charles Henry Domermuth and O.F. Edwards at the University of Kentucky in 1957 when they observed IBVs as \\"ring or doughnut- shaped structures.\\" D.M. Berry at the Glaxo Laboratories, Middlesex, UK, with J.G. Cruickshank, H.P. Chu and R.J.H. Wells at the University of Cambridge published a more comprehensive and better electron microscopic images in 1964. Four strains of IBV, including Beaudette strain, were compared with influenza virus, with which they share most resemblance. In contrast to influenza virus in which the projections were small and straight, all IBV strains had \\"pear- shaped projections\\", which were names the \\"spikes\\" and described as: > These ‚Äúspikes‚Äù were often seen over part of the surface only and were less > densely packed than those seen in influenza viruses. They varied > considerably in shape. Commonly they appeared to be attached to the virus by > a very narrow neck and to thicken towards their distal ends, sometimes > forming a bulbous mass 90-110 √Ö in diameter. J. F. David-Ferreira and R. A. Manaker from the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, were the first to study the structure of MHV in 1965. They also observed the surface projections as on IBV, stating, \\"The outer surface of the particle is covered by 'spicules'.\\" Transmission electron microscopic images of coronaviruses 229E (2), B814 (3) and IBV (4) In 1966, Tyrrell sought the help of Anthony Peter Waterson at the St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London who had recruited June Dalziel Almeida as an electron microscopist. Almeida had studied IBV and MHV finding them as structurally distinct viruses, but her manuscript was rejected upon a referee's decision that the microscopic images were of influenza virus and lacked novelty. Tyrrell supplied the human virus samples from which it was possible to ascertain the viral structure. Almeida and Tyrrell published their findings in the April 1967 issue of the Journal of General Virology, in which they concluded: > Probably the most interesting finding from these experiments was that two > human respiratory viruses, 229 E and B814 are morphologically identical with > avian infectious bronchitis. Their biological properties, as far as they are > known, are consistent with this. Both the human viruses are ether sensitive > as is avian infectious bronchitis 229 E, have a similar size by filtration > and multiply in the presence of an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Electron microscopic image of human coronavirus OC43 (Betacoronavirus 1) In 1967, Kenneth McIntosh and co-workers at the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, reported the structure of common cold viruses they collected from fellow workers during 1965-1966. They found six of their samples had common characters with B814. Two samples (designated OC38 and OC43, as the number of specimen in organ culture) were particularly virulent and caused encephalitis in experimental mice. They compared the structure of one of their samples numbered 501 (OC43 ) with those of 229E, IBV and influenza virus. It was so identical to IBV that they called the human viruses as \\"IBV-like viruses\\". They made a definitive description as: > All \\"IBV-like\\" viruses, 229E, and IBV itself show the following > characteristics: (1) an over-all diameter of 160 mŒº with a variation of ¬± > 440 mŒº; (2) a moderate pleomorphism with resultant elliptical, round, or > tear-drop shapes but no filamentous or \\"tailed\\" forms; (3) characteristic > spikes 20 mŒº long, usually club- or pear-shaped narrow at the base and 10 mŒº > wide at the outer edge, spaced widely apart and distributed fairly uniformly > about the circumference of the particle.  Invention of the name and history of the taxonomy  By mid-1967 it was recognised that IBV, MHV, B814 and 229E were structurally and biologically similar so that they form a distinct group. Tyrrell met Waterson and Almeida in London to decide on the name of the viruses. Almeida had earlier suggested the term \\"influenza-like\\" because of their resemblance, but Tyrrell thought it inappropriate. Almeida came up with a novel name \\"coronavirus\\". Tyrrell wrote of his recollection in Cold Wars: The Fight Against the Common Cold in 2002: > Even though we could only base our judgement on the electron microscope > images we were quite certain that we had identified a previously > unrecognised group of viruses. So what should we call them? 'Influenza-like' > seem a bit feeble, somewhat vague, and probably misleading. We looked more > closely at the appearance of the new viruses and noticed that they had a > kind of halo surrounding them. Recourse to a dictionary produced the Latin > equivalent, corona, and so the name coronavirus was born. Proposal of the new name was submitted to and accepted by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (ICNV, established in 1966). 16 November 1968 issue of Nature reported the justification by Almeida, Berry, C.H. Cunningham, Hamre, M.S. Hofstad, L. Mallucci, McIntosh and Tyrrell as: > Particles [of IBV] are more or less rounded in profile; although there is a > certain amount of polymorphism, there is also a characteristic \\"fringe\\" of > projections 200 √Ö long, which are rounded or petal shaped, rather than sharp > or pointed, as in the myxoviruses. This appearance, recalling the solar > corona, is shared by mouse hepatitis virus and several viruses recently > recovered from man, namely strain B814, 229E and several others... In the > opinion of the eight virologists these viruses are members of a previously > unrecognized group which they suggest should be called the coronaviruses, to > recall the characteristic appearance by which these viruses are identified > in the electron microscope. Coronavirus was accepted as a genus name by ICNV in its first report in 1971. IBV was then officially designated the type species as Avian infectious bronchitis virus (but renamed to Avian coronavirus in 2009). Mouse hepatitis virus approved in 1971 was merged with Rat coronavirus (discovered in 1970) as Murine coronavirus in 2009. 229E and OC43 were collectively named Human respiratory virus but merged as Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) in 2009. The first discovered human coronavirus B814 was antigenically different from 229E and OC43, but it could not be propagated in culture and was exhausted during experiments in 1968, thus, was excluded in taxonomy. Coroniviridae was adopted as the family name in the ICNV (soon after renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV) second report in 1975. 229E and OC43 were together named Human respiratory virus in the ICNV first report. The species was split into Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-OC229E) and Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) in 1995. While HCoV-OC229E is retained as a valid species, HCoV-OC43 was merged with Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (discovered in 1962), Bovine coronavirus (discovered in 1973), Human enteric coronavirus (discovered in 1975), Equine coronavirus (discovered in 2000) and Canine respiratory coronavirus (discovered in 2003) into a single species Betacoronavirus 1 in 2009. Owing to increasing number and diversity of new species discovered, CTV split the genus Coronavirus in 2009 into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus. As of 2020, there are 39 species of coronaviruses under the family Coronaviridae. There are 7 human coronaviruses while 32 species are those of pigs, dogs, cats, rodents, cows, horses, camels, Beluga whales, birds and bats.  Other human coronaviruses = Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV- NL63)  HCoV-NL63 was discovered in January 2003 from a seven-month-old baby in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The baby was suffering from bronchiolitis, coryza, conjunctivitis and fever. A year later, a comprehensive analysis of nasal swab samples was done from where it was found that a sample from an eight-month-old boy diagnosed in 1988 with pneumonia had a similar virus (HCoV-NL). The virus was independently described in 2005 as HCoV-NH following a discovery among a group of children having respiratory infection in New Haven, Connecticut, US. The origin of the virus remains a mystery, but it is closely related to tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) coronavirus and can survive in bat cell lines, suggesting that it is derived from animals (zoonotic).  Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1)  HCoV-HKU1 was discovered from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong, China, who was suffering from pneumonia in January 2004. When samples (nasopharyngeal aspirates from pneumonia patients) collected between April 2004 to March 2005 were analysed in 2006, it was found that 13 individuals had HCoV-HKU1. The same year, the virus was subsequently reported from Australia, Europe, and US.  Zoonotic coronaviruses  Coronaviruses that are transmitted from animals (zoonoses) are clinically the most important human coronaviruses as they are responsible for a series of global epidemics. There are two species of such coronaviruses: = 1. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus = Two distinct viruses are known under this species, namely SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV emerged as an acute respiratory syndrome in Guangdong Province, southern China, during 16 November 2002 to 28 February 2003. The syndrome was accompanied by pneumonia that was fatal in many cases. The infection was believed to have been contained in China, but an infected individual carried it to Hong Kong on 21 February and spread it in the hospital. The first clinical case outside China was reported on 26 February 2003 in Hanoi, Viet Nam. It rapidly spread to Southeast Asia, North America and Europe. The World Health Organization (WHO) notified an epidemic alert on 6 March 2003, referring to the disease as severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus was identified as a novel coronavirus from Hong Kong in April, from Toronto in May, and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in US in May. In October, the samples from Guangdong were established as the prototype specimens, and the name SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) was introduced. ICTV approved it as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2004, and renamed it Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in 2009. By mid-July 2003, the infection subsided, and by then it had spread to 28 countries infecting 8096 people and causing 774 deaths. In October, it was found that the infection was acquired from the masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) from a live-animal market in Guangdong. Further studies in 2005 showed that civets were the intermediate reservoirs of the virus, and horseshoe bats (Rhinilophus species) were the natural hosts. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was known from cases of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan city, China. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 individuals having \\"viral pneumonia\\" on 31 December 2019. The first known case was recorded on 12 December. The first case outside China was in Thailand on 13 January. WHO adopted the name of the disease as \\"coronavirus disease 2019\\" (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020, and used \\"2019 novel coronavirus\\" or \\"2019-nCoV\\" for the virus. On 2 March 2020, ICTV published the formal description and gave the official name as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). WHO declared the infection as pandemic on 11 March, and since then has spread to more than countries and territories, affecting over people and resulting resulting in more than deaths. The origin of the virus is not known. Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) which are available in the live-animal market in Wuhan city has been studied as a probable source as the virus is closely related to the pangolin coronavirus. Genetic evidence that it bears 93% nucleotide similarity with a novel coronavirus of Malayan horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus malayanus), and 96% identity with Bat SARS-like coronavirus RaTG13 of intermediate horseshoe bat (R. affinis) indicates that it probably originated in bats. = 2. Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus = In April 2012, the Ministry of Health, Jordan, reported an outbreak of acute respiratory illness affecting 11 people at a hospital in Zarqa. On 13 June 2012, a 60-year-old man having the symptoms was admitted to Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He was diagnosed with acute pneumonia and died on 24 June due to progressive respiratory and renal failure. His sputum sample showed the presence of coronavirus very similar to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. The virus was named HCoV-EMC (after Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where it was identified). Retrospective study of samples from the Jordan hospital revealed that the diseases and the virus were similar. WHO referred to the virus as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on 23 May 2013. ICTV announced the name as Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus on 15 May 2013. In 2013, a study revealed that the virus was 100% genetically identical to the coronavirus of the Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus coronavirus HKU4) from Bisha, Saudi Arabia, indicating its origin. In 2014, it was established that the virus was transmitted to humans by dromedary camels, which act as the intermediate hosts. By December 2019, the infection was confirmed in 2,499 individuals with 858 deaths (34¬∑3% mortality) from 27 countries covering all continents.  Other animal coronaviruses = Feline infectious peritonitis virus  A viral infection in pigs, called transmissible gastroenteritis, which was characterised mainly by diarrhoea and vomiting, and associated with high mortality was first recognised by Leo P. Doyle and L. M. Hutchings in 1946. A. W. McClurkin isolated and identified the virus in 1965. The virus was named Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine in the ICNV first report, and changed to Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (PTGV) in the second report in 1976. A new disease that caused inflammation of the abdomen (peritonitis) in cats was reported in 1966, the virus was identified in 1968, and was named by ICTV in 1991 as Feline infectious peritonitis virus. In 1974 a new coronavirus was discovered from US military dogs, and was named by ICTV in 1991 as Canine coronavirus. As the molecular and antigenic relationship of the three viruses were later established, ICTV merged the three viruses into Alphacoronavirus 1 in 2009.  Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  An acute infectious diarrhoea was first known in England in 1971. The infection was specifically among fattening pigs and sows. It was referred to as TOO (for \\"the other one\\") or TGE2 (for \\"transmissible gastroenteritis type 2\\") as the symptoms were similar to transmissible gastroenteritis. Other than causing rapid and acute diarrhoea, it was not a fatal disease. The case was first reported by J. Oldham in Pig Farming in 1972 using the term \\"epidemic diarrhea\\". A second outbreak occurred in 1976, and was called \\"porcine epidemic diarrhoea.\\" It eventually spread throughout Europe. M. B. Pensaert and P. de Bouck at the University of Gent, Begium isolated and identified the new coronavirus in 1978, and designated it CV777. It eventually spread throughout Europe. ICTV named the virus Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in 1995. An epidemic broke out from China in 2010 that spread throughout the world. A virulent strain emerged in US between 2013 and 2015. It affected pigs of all ages, and mortality was as high as 95% among the suckling piglets. Another severe outbreak occurred in Germany in 2014 that spread to other European countries.  Bat coronaviruses  Reagan and his colleagues at the University of Maryland were the first to investigate bats as a potential sources of coronavirus in 1956. They experimentally inoculated 44 cave bats or little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with IBV and found that all of them developed the symptoms of infectious bronchitis. Their report reads: > 50 percent of the bats exposed to the infectious bronchitis virus showed > symptoms or death in the intracerebral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, > intracardiac and intraocular groups; 75 percent in the intranasal and > intrarectal groups; 100 percent in the intraoral group; and 25 percent > intralingual and intramuscular group, whereas the controls appeared normal. But nothing was known of the real nature of bats as reservoirs of coronaviruses until the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome of humans in 2002/2003. Since the identification of SARS-CoV was identified in the early 2003, and horseshoe bats as their natural hosts in 2005, bats have been extensively studied. Among all coronavirus hosts, bats are known to harbour the most variety, with more than 30 species identified. According to diversity estimate, there may be 3,200 species of coronaviruses in bats.  Evolutionary history  According to phylogenetic estimate all coronaviruses evolved from the most recent common ancestor that lived around 190 to 489 (with a mean of 293) million years ago. The four genera split up around 2,400 to 3,300 years ago into bat and avian coronavirus ancestors. Bat coronavirus gave rise to species of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus that infect mammals, while avian coronavirus produced those of Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus that infect birds. Zoonotic coronaviruses emerged recently. For instance, SARS-CoV was transmitted from bats in 1998 (4.08 years prior to the outbreak), and diverged from bat coronavirus in around 1962. SARS-CoV-2 evolved from bat coronavirus in around 1948.

It was written by Francine Blanchet-Sadri, and published in 2008 by Chapman & Hall/CRC in their Discrete Mathematics and its Applications book series. Topics A partial word is a string whose characters may either belong to a given alphabet or be a wildcard character. Such a word can represent a set of strings over the alphabet without wildcards, by allowing each wildcard character to be replaced by any single character of the alphabet, independently of the replacements of the other wildcard characters. Two partial words are compatible when they agree on their non-wildcard characters, or equivalently when there is a string that they both match; one partial word x contains another partial word y if they are compatible and the non-wildcard positions of x contain those of y; equivalently, the strings matched by x are a subset of those matched by y. The book has 12 chapters, which can be grouped into five larger parts. The first part consists of two introductory chapters defining partial words, compatibility and containment, and related concepts. The second part generalizes to partial words some standard results on repetitions in strings, and the third part studies the problem of characterizing and recognizing primitive partial words, the partial words that have no repetition. Part four concerns codes defined from sets of partial words, in the sense that no two distinct concatenations of partial words from the set can be compatible with each other. A final part includes three chapters on advanced topics including the construction of repetitions of given numbers of copies of partial words that are compatible with each other, enumeration of the possible patterns of repetitions of partial words, and sets of partial words with the property that every infinite string contains a substring matching the set. Each chapter includes a set of exercises, and the end of the book provides hints to some of these exercises. Audience and reception Although Algorithmic Combinatorics on Partial Words is primarily aimed at the graduate level, reviewer Mikl√≥s B√≥na writes that it is for the most part \\"remarkably easy to read\\" and suggests that it could also be read by advanced undergraduates. However, B√≥na criticizes the book as being too focused on the combinatorics on words as an end in itself, with no discussion of how to translate mathematical structures of other types into partial words so that the methods of this book can be applied to them. Because of this lack of generality and application, he suggests that the audience for the book is likely to consist only of other researchers specializing in this area. Similarly, although Patrice S√©√©bold notes that this area can be motivated by applications to gene comparison, he criticizes the book as being largely a catalog of its author's own research results in partial words, without the broader thematic overview or identification of the fundamental topics and theorems that one would expect of a textbook, and suggests that a textbook that accomplishes these goals is still waiting to be written. However, reviewer Jan Kratochv√≠l is more positive, calling this \\"the first reference book on the theory of partial words\\", praising its pacing from introductory material to more advanced topics, and writing that it well supports its underlying thesis that many of the main results in the combinatorics of words without wildcards can be extended to partial words. He summarizes it as \\"an excellent textbook as well as a reference book for interested researchers\\".

Life Soltau was born in 1843 in Plymouth. She was the eldest but one of the eight children of Henry William and Lucy Soltau. When she was ten in August 1954 she was baptised by the Plymouth Brethren evangelist pastor Robert Chapman. Her father was a teacher for the Plymouth Brethren and a writer. She and her sisters, Lucy and Agnes, were her father's assistants at his outdoor meetings. She recalls how enthusiastic her father was after hearing James Hudson Taylor talk and immediately began organising for him to talk at his meeting. After they heard him talk then it was decided that Agnes would not become a missionary but Henrietta would and Agnes would support her. Henrietta volunteered with her family's support. Her father and her brothers became Taylor's supporters. George Brearley was a tract writer and well regarded Plymouth Brethren. Soltau and her sister were soon helping him after the family had moved to Exeter. In 1882 when she nearly forty she had a spiritual event known as a \\"second blessing\\" and she was then established with the Plymouth Brethren. Before this her father had allowed her to preach but only in the fresh air or in the meeting room. She started to support the China Inland Mission (CIM) who sent missionaries to China and the group founded by James Hudson Taylor. The CIM were unusual because they wore traditional Chinese clothes and they did not solicit funds but relied on people assisting with contributions of time or money. Soltau decide to help with the children of the missionaries who required a home. She set up a home for them in Tottenham. In time this moved to Hastings, where Soltau also created a branch of the YWCA, a holiday home and she delivered evangelistic services at the Railway Mission Hall. She led the newly created China Inland Mission's ladies' council at James Hudson Taylor's invitation. In 1889 she set up a training facility for women who wanted to be missionaries for the China Inland Mission. Soltau had wanted to be a missionary herself but her health was not considered sufficient. However she did set out in 1897 and spent over a year in a visit to China. She retired in 1916 from training missionaries who went to many parts of the world and 547 were to assist the CIM. Soltau continued to support the CIM in her retirement as Chair of the women's council. Soltau died in 1934 in London.

The main focus of the label is on rock / hard rock / heavy metal. The distribution extends over Europe (Soulfood Music) and North America (Soulfood-Amped). History The beginnings of El Puerto Records go back to 2011 when Stormwitch founder Harald Spengler (alias Lee Tarot) teamed up with co-founders Stefan Kauffmann (git) and Peter Langer (drums) to record new songs. After Spengler's death in 2013, the decision was made to continue Spengler's musical legacy under the name Witchbound. This also became the first release by El Puerto Records in 2015. This was followed in 2016 by the releases of \\"The Phans\\" (vintage rock) and Stepfather Fred (alternative rock), two bands from southern Germany, which the label noticed primarily because of their live qualities. When Matt Bischof joined the promotion department, the label began to become increasingly international. With the American singer David Reece (ex-Accept) and his Sainted Sinners (including Frank Pan√© (Bonfire) and Ferdy Doernberg), another big name joined the label in 2016. In 2017, the European distribution of Beasto Blanco was taken over by Alice Cooper bassist Chuck Garric and Calico Cooper, the daughter of Alice Cooper. Souldrinker and Mystic Prophecy guitarist Markus Pohl made a debut in the same year. The increasing attention in the music scene led to larger and more experienced bands joining the label in 2018: Undertow and the German thrash metal band Necronomicon [5]. With the Italians Alight and the Swiss Bloodlost, other bands joined. The year was rounded off by Mission in Black [6] and Ginger Red [7]. At the turn of the year 2019, Bodo Schopf (drummer from Michael Schenker and The Sweet) and David Readman (Pink Cream 69, Voodoo Circle, Almanac) joined Pendulum of Fortune [8] and Dark Blue Inc [9]. u. a. with Frank Pan√© (Bonfire), G√∂ran Edman (Ex- Malmsteen), Hal Patino (Maryann Cotton, Ex-King Diamond, Ex-Pretty Maids) and Harry Reischmann. The latter came up with a guest appearance by Ian Paice [10] (Deep Purple) on the debut CD. The orientation of the labels, both to oblige bands from the immediate region and to perform internationally, ensured that more international acts joined the label in 2019: Nightqueen [11] from Belgium and, for the first time, a band from Australia - Envenomed [12]. In the summer of 2019, another old friend came with the Austrians Garagedays and the Sons Of Sounds from the Karlsruhe area: David Reece returned to El Puerto Records after a short interlude to continue his solo career there, as well as the Danish / US combo Maryann Cotton. Also from Denmark: Phonomics. But expansion continued in 2020 as well. Welicoruss from Siberia joined them, followed by two German metal bands (Scorged - Saarland, Red To Grey - Bavaria).

It is a subsidiary of TPG Telecom Limited.  Products and services  Vodafone's key products and services include:  Mobile telephony  Mobile voice and data is Vodafone's core business. Its mobile network operates on the following frequencies: * 3G UMTS 900/2100 MHz * 4G LTE 850/1800/2100 MHz * 5G Network Vodafone's 3G UMTS uses 900 MHz for 3G services outside of capital cities, to equal or surpass their older GSM coverage, and has also expanded this network to a limited extent into metro areas. Vodafone's 4G 1800 MHz rollout commenced with 20 MHz of bandwidth in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Newcastle and Wollongong on 12 June 2013. Vodafone has also rolled out 4G 850 MHz by refarming 5 MHz of their 3G spectrum in capital cities covering 95% of Australia's metro population in 2014, and has enabled carrier aggregation on both their 4G bands. In April 2017, Vodafone was a successful bidder for 4G spectrum on the 700 MHz band at auction, but appears not to have commenced services on this band as of August 2018. Vodafone's 5G NR network is coming to areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth from mid-2020 with more a plan of expansion to more than 650 sites progressively going live from mid-2020 = Network history = The Vodafone 2G and 3G (2100/900 MHz) networks originally operated as a single network, separate to the Three network. Vodafone first entered the Australian market in 1992 when it was awarded the third mobile network operator license in Australia in December that year (after Telstra and Optus). Vodafone Australia then launched its 2G GSM mobile network in October 1993. During the 2009 merger, VHA had made no comment on their intention to combine the Three and Vodafone networks, or offer roaming between them. As of late-2009 however, roaming onto the Vodafone's 2G network had been enabled for Three customers in areas that had limited 3G coverage (e.g. blackspots). In late 2010, VHA announced plans to consolidate the Three and Vodafone networks, in an attempt to better compete with Telstra's Next G network. The plan included the expansion of UMTS 900/2100 MHz coverage in 900 metropolitan sites and 500 outer metropolitan sites across Australia, an end to the 3GIS network (3's UMTS 2100 MHz network, which it has a 50% stake with, the other 50% being held by Telstra), as well as the roll out of 1400 UMTS-850 base stations - 850 MHz being the same band in which the Next G network operates. Three operated a 2100 MHz 3G network in a 50/50 partnership with Telstra, which covered approximately 56% of Australia's population across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, the Gold Coast, Canberra, Geelong, Frankston and Wollongong. In areas not covered by the joint 3G network, customers were able to roam on Telstra's Next G 850 MHz 3G network, and Telstra's 900 MHz and 1800 MHz 2G networks. This agreement allowed Three to offer coverage to up to 96% of the population. This network, and with it the final links to the Three network from an infrastructure perspective, was shut down on 31 August 2012 following the termination of the network sharing agreement. Vodafone began to shut down its 2G network on 30 April 2018, and completed the switch-off on 30 June.  Internet services  Vodafone offers broadband plans and bundles via the National Broadband Network, marketed as Vodafone nbn. These services were launched in December 2017 as the first fixed-line product offered by Vodafone in Australia.  Internet of things  Vodafone offers a customer support desk for IoT terminals and connectivity. It is an end-to-end service with a single contract for hardware, connectivity and shipment to a variety of destinations  Vodafone TV  Vodafone TV‚Ñ¢ is Vodafone's smart TV box powered by Android TV. It provides access to thousands of movies, shows and games from Google Play, YouTube, Netflix, AmazonPrime and other popular apps.  Marketing and sponsorship  Vodafone have been involved in a variety of sports sponsorships in Australia. From 1998 to 2004 Vodafone were the shirt sponsors for the Australian national rugby union team, the Wallabies. In 2010, Vodafone replaced Three as the shirt sponsor of the Australian national cricket team. Vodafone was the naming rights sponsor of Triple Eight Race Engineering in V8 Supercars from 2007 to 2012. During that period, TeamVodafone won four championships and four Bathurst 1000 races. In 2012, Vodafone terminated their cricket and motorsport sponsorships with money reinvested into improving their mobile network and customer service. In 2015, Vodafone & The Garvan Institute of Medical Research launched Dreamlab. An app that allows users to help find a cure for cancer by pooling their smartphones' computing power. The app is free & available is available on both App Store and Google Play. In 2017, Vodafone made a return to sports sponsorships in Australia. In rugby union, Vodafone became the title sponsor of Super Rugby within Australia. In motorsport, Vodafone sponsored a BMW M6 GT3 in the 2017 Bathurst 12 Hour and reunited with Triple Eight Race Engineering for the 2019 event as the primary sponsor of the team's Mercedes-AMG GT3. Within Supercars, it became title sponsor of the safety car and the Gold Coast 600.  Ownership structure and history = Three-Vodafone merger (June 2009)  VHA was created on 10 June 2009, after shareholders and the ACCC approved a merger between Hutchison Telecommunications Australia (owner of the Three network) and Vodafone Australia. At the time of the merger, Former VHA chief executive Nigel Dews said \\"the first priority is around people and getting the organisation and the organisational structure sorted out\\", and that head office functions would see the greatest redundancies. During the merger, Vodafone Hutchison Australia announced it would buy out its Vodafone branded stores, previously run by the retail management groups Digicall, First Mobile, Inside Mobile and GSM. The new retail structure lifted VHA's current headcount by 1,400 to 5,100 staff, and added over 170 stores. Three-branded stores were already owned by VHA. Before the merger with Three: * Vodafone Group plc owned Vodafone Australia Limited (which runs the Vodafone network) * Hutchison Whampoa Limited owned 52% of Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Limited, which owned Hutchison 3G Australia Pty Limited (\\"H3GA\\") (which runs the \\"3\\" network) In the merger, Hutchison 3G Australia was renamed Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Ltd, and 50% was sold to Vodafone Group. The ownership structure of the current entity, Vodafone Hutchison Australia, is: * Vodafone Group owns 50% of Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Ltd * Hutchison Telecommunications Australia owns 50% of Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Ltd * Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Ltd owns 100% of Vodafone Australia Limited The merger created an entity of nearly 7 million subscribers, A$4 billion in annual revenue and a 27 per cent market share making it Australia's third largest mobile telecommunications provider behind Telstra and Optus. The discrepancy between these numbers and the present figures can be attributed at least partially to a series of major failures of the VHA mobile network that occurred between 2009 and 2012, dubbed 'Vodafail' (a term used widely in the media and by users on social media networks to describe the outages.) More than two million customers left VHA over the period from 2010 to 2013. VHA began phasing out the Three brand in mid-2011. At the time registration of new subscribers to Three ended and would instead become Vodafone customers. The Three network was shut down completely on 30 August 2013.  VHA-TPG merger  On 30 August 2018 VHA announced plans to merge with TPG, the second- largest internet service provider in Australia, with Vodafone Group and Hutchison Telecommunications Australia to own a combined 50.1% of the combined group and TPG shareholders the remaining 49.9%. In December 2018, the merger plans were called into question by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which expressed 'concerns' regarding a potential reduction in competition if the merger were to proceed. In particular, the regulator signalled its concern that the merger would essentially remove Vodafone from the fixed-line broadband market and remove TPG (an 'aggressive' low-cost competitor) from the mobile market. This ultimately led the ACCC to block the proposal in May 2019. The ACCC's decision was overturned by the Federal Court of Australia in February 2020, giving TPG and VHA permission to merge as planned. The Court ruled that TPG no longer held ambitions to enter the Australian mobile market with its own infrastructure, with the merger therefore not likely to reduce competition levels in the market.

Originally, they were used to model the variation in the relative quantity of mature cells in the blood. The equations are defined as: and where P(t) represents the density of cells over time, and \\\\beta_0, \\\\theta, n, \\\\tau, \\\\gamma are parameters of the equations. Equation (), in particular, is notable in dynamical systems since it can result in chaotic attractors with various dimensions. Introduction Time series generated from the Mackey-Glass equations. This can be seen as modelling a healthy variation of blood cell density. Here, \\\\tau = 6. Also generated from the Mackey-Glass equations, but now could be seen as pathological blood cell density variation. Here, \\\\tau = 22. There exist an enormous number of physiological systems that involve or rely on the periodic behaviour of certain subcomponents of the system. For example, many homeostatic processes rely on negative feedback to control the concentration of substances in the blood; breathing, for instance, is promoted by the detection, by the brain, of high CO2 concentration in the blood. One way to model such systems mathematically is with the following simple ordinary differential equation: : y'(t) = k - c y(t) where k is the rate at which a \\"substance\\" is produced, and c controls how the current level of the substance discourages the continuation of its production. The solutions of this equation can be found via an integrating factor, and have the form: :y(t) = \\\\frac{k}{c} + f(y_0) e^{- c y} where y_0 is any initial condition for the initial value problem. However, the above model assumes that variations in the substance concentration is detected immediately, which often not the case in physiological systems. In order to ease this problem, proposed changing the production rate to a function k(y(t - \\\\tau)) of the concentration at an earlier point t - \\\\tau in time, in hope that this would better reflect the fact that there is a significant delay before the bone marrow produces and releases mature cells in the blood, after detecting low cell concentration in the blood. By taking the production rate k as being: : \\\\frac{\\\\beta_0 \\\\theta^n}{\\\\theta^n + P(t - \\\\tau)^n} ~~ \\\\text{ or } ~~ \\\\frac{\\\\beta_0 \\\\theta^n P(t - \\\\tau)}{\\\\theta^n + P(t - \\\\tau)^n} we obtain Equations () and (), respectively. The values used by were \\\\gamma = 0.1, \\\\beta_0 = 0.2 and n = 10, with initial condition P(0) = 0.1. The value of \\\\theta is not relevant for the purpose of analyzing the dynamics of Equation (), since the change of variable P(t) = \\\\theta \\\\cdot Q(t) reduces the equation to: : Q'(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\beta_0 Q(t - \\\\tau)}{1 + Q(t - \\\\tau)^n} - \\\\gamma Q(t). This is why, in this context, plots often place Q(t) = P(t) / \\\\theta in the y-axis. Dynamical behaviour Mackey-Glass Attractors for Various values of the parameter \\\\tau It is of interest to study the behaviour of the equation solutions when \\\\tau is varied, since it represents the time taken by the physiological system to react to the concentration variation of a substance. An increase in this delay can be caused by a pathology, which in turn can result in chaotic solutions for the Mackey-Glass equations, especially Equation (). When \\\\tau = 6, we obtain a very regular periodic solution, which can be seen as characterizing \\"healthy\\" behaviour; on the other hand, when \\\\tau = 22 the solution gets much more erratic. The Mackey-Glass attractor can be visualized by plotting the pairs (P(t), P(t - \\\\tau), P(t - 2\\\\tau)). This is somewhat justified because delay differential equations can (sometimes) be reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations, and also because they are approximately infinite dimensional maps.

It was built in 1867‚Äì68 as a replacement to an earlier church and was demolished in 1969. History St John's was built in 1867‚Äì68 as the replacement of an earlier church which was described in the Post Office Directory as being a \\"small ancient fabric\\" with a nave and chancel but no tower. It was demolished in 1866, prior to the construction of the new church approximately 70 yards eastwards. The new church, also dedicated to St John the Evangelist, was built at the sole expense of John Trenchard Trenchard, the patron of the living and owner of the Poxwell and Ringstead estates. It was designed by Mr. George Evans of Wimborne Minster and built by Mr. R. Reynolds of Wimborne Minster. The carving work was carried out by Mr. Grassby of Dorchester. St John's was consecrated on 22 April 1868 by the Bishop of Sodor and Man, the Right Rev. Horatio Powys, on behalf of the Bishop of Salisbury (the Right Rev. Walter Kerr Hamilton), who was unable to consecrate the church due to illness. The church was demolished in 1969, following the union of the parishes of Osmington and Poxwell. The building was considered unsafe and too costly to maintain. The churchyard remains near the site of the church. Architecture St John's was made up of a nave, chancel with south vestry, north and south transepts, north porch, and circular west tower with spire, the latter reaching a height of 90 feet. The lower part of the tower was designed to form a small baptistery. The church's font was made of Bath stone, with the column being supported by six detached shafts of Devonshire marble. Some of the church's fittings were transferred from the older church, including the single bell, which dated to the 15th century and was cast at Wokingham. With the church's demolition, the bell was moved to St Martin's Church at Broadmayne. Fittings taken from the earlier church included a marble tablet to Joseph Kingstone Warne, 1823, and his wife Leah, 1838, another to Roger Warne, 1831, and Martha, daughter of Joseph Kingstone and Leah Warne, 1834, another to Mary Anne, daughter of Joseph Kingstone and Leah Warne, 1846, and a fourth to the former rector George Pickard, 1840, and his wife, 1828.

Precursors  Puebloan societies contain elements of three major cultures that dominated the Southwest United States region before European contact: the Mogollon Culture, whose adherents occupied an area near Gila Wilderness; the Hohokam Culture; and the Ancestral Puebloan Culture who occupied the Mesa Verde region of the Four Corners area.Cordell, Linda S. Ancient Pueblo Peoples, St. Remy Press and Smithsonian Institution (1994); .  Mogollon culture  Archeological evidence suggest that people partaking in the Mogollon /mo ä…°…ôÀàjo än/ culture were initially foragers who augmented their subsistence through the development of farming. Around the first millennium CE, however, farming became the main means to obtain food. Water control features are common among Mimbres branch sites, which date from the 10th through 12th centuries CE. The nature and density of Mogollon residential villages changed through time. The earliest Mogollon villages were small hamlets composed of several pithouses (houses excavated into the ground surface, with stick and thatch roofs supported by a network of posts and beams, and faced on the exterior with earth). Village sizes increased over time and, by the 11th century, villages composed of ground level dwellings made with rock and earth walls, with roofs supported by post and beam networks, became common. Cliff-dwellings became common during the 13th and 14th centuries.  Hohokam culture  Hohokam is term borrowed from the O'odham language, used to define an archaeological culture that relied on irrigation canals to water their crops since as early as the 9th century CE. Their irrigation system techniques allowed for its adherents to expand into the largest population in the Southwest by 1300. Archaeologists working at a major archaeological dig in the 1990s in the Tucson Basin, along the Santa Cruz River, identified a culture and people that were ancestors of the Hohokam who might have occupied southern Arizona as early as 2000 BCE. This prehistoric group from the Early Agricultural Period grew corn, lived year- round in sedentary villages, and developed sophisticated irrigation canals from the beginning of the common era to about the middle of the 15th century. Within a larger context, the Hohokam culture area inhabited a central trade position between the Patayan situated along the Lower Colorado River and in southern California; the Trincheras of Sonora, Mexico; the Mogollon culture in eastern Arizona, southwest New Mexico, and northwest Chihuahua, Mexico; and the Ancestral Puebloans in northern Arizona, northern New Mexico, southwest Colorado, and southern Utah.  Ancestral Puebloan culture  The Ancestral Puebloan culture is known for the stone and earth dwellings its people built along cliff walls, particularly during the Pueblo II and Pueblo III eras, from about 900 to 1350 CE in total. The best-preserved examples of the stone dwellings are now protected within United States' national parks, such as Navajo National Monument, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, Mesa Verde National Park, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Aztec Ruins National Monument, Bandelier National Monument, Hovenweep National Monument, and Canyon de Chelly National Monument. These villages were accessible only by rope or through rock climbing. However, the first Ancestral Puebloan homes and villages were based on the pit-house, a common feature in the Basketmaker periods. Villages consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, and other local materials, or were carved into the sides of canyon walls. Design details from Ancestral Puebloan villages contain elements from cultures as far away as present-day Mexico. In their day, these ancient towns and cities were usually multistoried and multipurposed buildings surrounding open plazas and viewsheds. They were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Ancestral Pueblo peoples. These population complexes hosted cultural and civic events and infrastructure that supported a vast outlying region hundreds of miles away linked by transportation roadways.  Development of architecture and city-states  Ruins of Pueblo Bonito, in Chaco Canyon By about 700 to 900 CE, the Puebloans began to move away from ancient pit houses dug in cliffs and to construct connected rectangular rooms arranged in apartment-like structures made of adobe and adapted to sites. By 1050, they had developed planned villages composed of large terraced buildings, each with many rooms. These apartment-house villages were often constructed on defensive sites: on ledges of massive rock, on flat summits, or on steep-sided mesas, locations that would afford the Puebloans protection from raiding parties originating from the north, such as the Comanche and Navajo. The largest of these villages, Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, contained around 700 rooms in five stories; it may have housed as many as 1000 persons.Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America Los Angeles (2015). Chapter 1, p. 4 Pueblo buildings are constructed as complex apartments with numerous rooms, often built in strategic defensive positions. The most highly developed were large villages or pueblos situated at the very top of the mesas, the rocky tablelands typical to the Southwest.  European contact  Before 1598, Spanish exploration of the present-day Pueblo areas was limited to an assortment of small groups. A group of colonizers led by Juan de O√±ate arrived at the end of the 16th Century as part of an apostolic mission to convert the Natives. Despite initial peaceful contact, Spain's attempts to dispose of Pueblo religion and replace it with Catholicism became increasingly more aggressive, and were met with great resistance by Puebloans, whose governmental structure was based around the figure of the cacique, a theocratic leader for both material and spiritual matters. Over the years, Spaniards' methods grew harsher, leading to a series of revolts by the Puebloans.  Pueblo Revolt  Jemez Pueblo shield, circa 1840 The Pueblo Revolt that started in 1680 was the first led by a Native American group to successfully expel colonists from North America for a considerable number of years. It followed the successful Tiguex War led by Tiwas against the Coronado Expedition in 1540‚Äì41, which temporarily halted Spanish advances in present-day New Mexico. The 17th Century's revolt was a direct consequence of growing discontent among the Northern Pueblos against the abuses of the Spaniards, which finally brewed into a large organized uprising against European colonizers. The events that led to the Pueblo Revolt go back at least a decade before the formal uprising began. In the 1670s, severe drought swept the region, which caused both a famine among the Pueblo and increased the frequency of raids by the Apache. Neither Spanish nor Pueblo soldiers were able to prevent the attacks by the Apache raiding parties. The unrest among the Pueblos came to a head in 1675, when Governor Juan Francisco Trevi√±o ordered the arrest of forty-seven Pueblo medicine men and accused them of practicing sorcery. Four of the medicine men were sentenced to death by hanging; three of those sentences were carried out, while the fourth prisoner committed suicide. The remaining men were publicly whipped and sentenced to prison. When the news of the killings and public humiliation reached Pueblo leaders, they moved in force to Santa Fe, where the prisoners were held. Because a large number of Spanish soldiers were away fighting the Apache, Governor Trevi√±o was forced to release the prisoners. Among those released was an Ohkay Owingeh Tewa man named Pop√©. After being released, Pop√© took up residence in Taos Pueblo far from the capital of Santa Fe and spent the next five years seeking support for a revolt among the 46 Pueblo villages. He was able to gain the support of the Northern Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Tano, and Keres- speaking Pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. The Pecos Pueblo, 50 miles east of the Rio Grande pledged its participation in the revolt as did the Zuni and Hopi, 120 and 200 miles respectively west of the Rio Grande. At the time, the Spanish population was of about 2,400 colonists, including mixed-blood mestizos, and Indian servants and retainers, who were scattered thinly throughout the region. Starting early on August 10, 1680, Pop√© and leaders of each of the Pueblos sent a knotted rope carried by a runner to the next Pueblo; the number of knots signified the number of days to wait before beginning the uprising. Finally, on August 21, 2,500 Puebloan warriors took the colony's capital Santa Fe from Spanish control, killing many colonizers, the remainder of whom were successfully expelled.Paul Horgan (1954), Great River vol. 1, p. 286. On September 22, 2005, the statue of Po'pay (Pop√©), the leader of the Pueblo Revolt, was unveiled in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. The statue was the second commissioned by the state of New Mexico for National Statuary Hall; it was the 100th and last to be added to the collection, which represents the Senate. It was created by Cliff Fragua, a Puebloan from Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico. It is the only statue in the collection to be created by a Native American.Po'pay dedication  References  External links  * Category:Oasisamerica cultures Category:Southwest tribes Category:Native American tribes in Arizona Category:Native American tribes in New Mexico Category:Native American tribes in Texas Category:Native American history of New Mexico ","title":"History of the Puebloans"},{"id":"64800015","title":"2014 Oxel√∂sund municipal election"},{"id":"64800016","text":"Moiti√© de polka (literally \\"Half polka\\") was a 1908 French short silent film by Georges M√©li√®s.

Biography  Edith Sch√∂nert was born on 7 August 1933 in Dresden. After she graduated from secondary school there, Sch√∂nert moved to Berlin to study History at Humboldt University. She began work on 1 September 1956, aged 23, at the Academy of Sciences of the GDR (Central Institute for Ancient History and Archaeology); her first project was on the mints of Greece - the study of which was to continue throughout her career. She became instrumental in the post-war continuation of the Corpus Nummorum, established by Theodor Mommsen. In 1960, Sch√∂nert-Gei√ü was awarded a doctorate from Humboldt University for research on the provincial coinage of Perinthus. In addition to her research and publications on ancient Thrace, Sch√∂nert-Gei√ü studied Roman coins found in forts along the Danube. Her early work on the mint of Selymbria was reviewed as particularly useful, placing it in the context of its larger neighbouring mints. Sch√∂nert-Gei√ü taught at both the Free University and at Humboldt University. At her retirement from the Academy of Sciences on 31 August 1998, she was honoured with a Festschrift which commemorated her meticulous scholarship. One of her last publications was a comprehensive bibliography of Thracian coinage, which was monumental in its scope, with 9350 references.  Personal life  After her marriage, she took the name Gei√ü for personal matters, but published her academic work under the name Sch√∂nert-Gei√ü. In her spare time she enjoyed needlework and embroidery. Sch√∂nert-Gei√ü died on the 12 June 2012. Her funeral was attended by colleagues and the taxi driver who she employed on a daily basis.  Honours  For her services to research into Greek coinage, she was made an honorary member of the Romanian Numismatic Society in 1963 and an honorary member of the Numismatic Society of Stara Zagora in Bulgaria in 1987. The city of Stara Zagora granted her honorary citizenship for her services to numismatics. She was also an honorary member of the International Numismatic Council.

It was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 821‚Äì823 in its catalogues. Plot On a large canvas-and-wood billboard, a man glues a poster showing two stars of L'Amour √† cr√©dit, a show at the Parisiana music hall. It is surrounded by posters showing other figures, advertising various products: Poirot meat extract, Tripaulin paint, Nouveau D√©p√¥t porcelain, Poudre de F√©es face powder, Quinquina au Cacao liqueur, Trouillottine lamps, and Mignon corsets. The man leaves, and two gendarmes pass by. As soon as the coast is clear, the people shown in the posters begin coming to life. The two Parisiana stars leave their poster entirely and walk around, busily talking to the residents of the other posters. A fracas breaks out when one of the stars begins flirting with the corset model, and the porcelain vendor drops his wares onto the ground. The figures turn back into flat images as the gendarmes pass by again. As a well-dressed gentleman crosses in front of the posters, they come alive again and begin throwing all their wares at him. The two gendarmes and two officers rush onto the scene, and all four are soon covered with face powder, powdered paint, and other products. The whole billboard comes toppling down with a crash, revealing the poster residents in real life behind a fence. As the police set the billboard to rights and look through the torn posters, they see all the poster residents dance happily off. Production The Hilarious Posters was probably commissioned by Victor de Cottens for showing as part of the 1905 edition of the annual Folies Berg√®re revue. (Though the descriptions of the show do not mention M√©li√®s, he is credited in the program, and a scene closely resembling the action of the film is described in a surviving copy of the script.) The film may have been inspired by Gaston Velle's film La Valise de Barnum (Path√©, 1904), in which a man shows various posters and the figures in them come to life. Of the posters shown, \\"Tripaulin\\" parodies the paint brand Ripolin; \\"Mignon\\" may be the corset brand Myst√®re, for whom M√©li√®s had made an advertising film; \\"Nouveau D√©p√¥t\\" is the Grand D√©p√¥t, a crockery shop; and the Parisiana was a real Paris music hall on the Grands Boulevards, run by the same producer who helmed the Folies, Paul Ruez. L'Amour √† cr√©dit, the Parisiana show being advertised, had begun running on 26 August 1905. M√©li√®s appears in the film as the man who glues the posters, with Vilbert, one of the headlining acts at the Parisiana, playing himself on his poster. The special effects in the film are created by substitution splices and, for the Tripaulin poster, a carefully worked multiple exposure with the three painters filmed at a much greater distance than the rest of the action.

The group specializes in robotics-based automation for the tire, food & beverage, and distribution industries. It designs, programs, and assembles robots, the majority of which are exported. The headquarters of Cimcorp Oy is located in Ulvila, Finland. Cimcorp is a member of Murata Machinery, Ltd. (Muratec) of Japan.  History = 1975‚Äì1985 Rosenlew Automation  The first mention of a robot factory dates to 1973, when Antti Soini was doing his thesis work on industrial robots at Oy W. Rosenlew Ab. The start of the robot factory is considered to be in 1975, when Rosenlew made a robot for Kemira that transferred explosive charges from the warehouse to the loading station at the Vihtavuori plant. The biggest project for the department in the early days was the supply of 44 cathode ray tube handling robots to the Finnish Valco CRT factory in Imatra. Modules for the linear transfer robots were developed during the time of this project. For a long time, CRT factories around the world were the main customers for the company. Rosenlew Automation also began to manufacture paint tinting machines in collaboration with Oy Winter Ab and University of Oulu. In 1981 Rosenlew Automation moved to a factory hall next to highway 2 (from Helsinki to Pori) in Ulvila. In 1984 Rosenlew Automation founded a subsidiary in Illinois, USA - Rosenlew Automation Inc. ‚Äì to take care of business in the US markets.  1986‚Äì1996 W√§rtsil√§ Cimcorp  The name Cimcorp was adopted in 1986 when the company became a subsidiary of W√§rtsil√§ as a result of an acquisition. At the same time as buying Rosenlew Automation Inc. in the USA, W√§rtsil√§ also bought the robotics company GCA Robotics, combined them and named the new company Cimcorp Inc. At the end of the 1980s, the company built up its business around the block welding robots for ships, but had to abandon the project in 1990. W√§rtsil√§ became Metra and in 1993 sold off the Cimcorp units operating in the United States and in 1996 it also sold Cimcorp, Finland.  1996‚Äì2003 Swisslog Cimcorp and Swisslog  The new owner of the company was Swisslog Group of Switzerland, operating in about twenty countries, which aimed to create a supplier group specializing in major logistics. Swisslog‚Äôs customers included mail order giant Otto Versand, IKEA, Deutsche Post, Lufthansa, Hewlett-Packard, BMW, Daimler Chrysler, Opel, Bayer, BASF, and the largest retail chain in the world, Walmart. Through this deal, Cimcorp Oy redirected its operations toward order-picking systems for the food & beverage industry, when it began to automate the order picking and handling of products in standard-sized crates. Robots moved and collected crates containing bakery and processed meat products, fruit, dairy products, drinks cans, or bottles. By the late 1990s, Cimcorp had a staff of about 200 and about 30 regular subcontractors in the local region of Satakunta. Its key market areas were located in Europe, South East Asia, and North America, with exports accounting for 90 percent of sales. Over half of the company‚Äôs net sales of 250 million Finnish markkas came from automation systems for the CRT industry. There were only two companies in the global marketplace, Cimcorp and Hirata of Japan, serving about 100 CRT factories. Because of the limited nature of the market and seasonal fluctuations, Cimcorp expanded its business to logistics systems for the retail and industrial sectors. The first clients were the Pouttu meat distribution center as well as AGA and Hartwall, which used gantry robots supplied by Cimcorp to move gas bottles and drinks crates, respectively. By 1997, over 600 robot systems had been supplied to its clients. In 1999, Cimcorp Oy‚Äôs business operations were divided into two companies. Cimcorp Oy continued the company‚Äôs robotics business, and a new company was set up for the paint tinting machine business called Corob Oy, half of which was owned by Swisslog and the other half by Tikkurila Oyj. In the 2000s, the company‚Äôs business changed and it started to automate food & beverage industry distribution centers and tire manufacturing. The company‚Äôs first tire industry customer was Nokian Tyres in 2001. In 2001, Cimcorp Oy extended its premises in UlviIa and founded the new Kiinteist√∂ Oy Ulvilan Logistiikkatalo company, in partnership with the municipality of Ulvila. At that time, Cimcorp employed 220 in Ulvila and 5 in Vantaa. Cimcorp‚Äôs name changed to Swisslog Oy in 2002. Swisslog group refocused its strategy and announced that it was going to sell the four companies belonging to the Material Flow&Robotic; Systems division, one of which was Swisslog Oy. It also sold Corob to a Vantaa-based company, CPS Color. In March 2003 Swisslog laid off 40 people in Ulvila for a short time, which had 200 employees at the time.nime√§m√§t√∂n artikkeli nro 92891, Satakunnan Kansa, ei p√§iv√§yst√§. By June the order book had improved and over half of those laid off were back at work. In September Swisslog made a deal worth 16 million euros to automate the distribution centers of the Valio dairies in Jyv√§skyl√§ and Riihim√§ki. The order was the biggest Finnish deal in Swisslog‚Äôs history. The deal meant that logistics systems sales overtook the previous main line of business, the CRT industry.  2003‚Äì2014 Cimcorp  In December 2003 the executive directors of Swisslog Oy bought both Swisslog Oy with its staff of 205 and Ulvilan Logistiikkatalo and returned to using the name Cimcorp Oy. In 2006 Cimcorp made an important advance for the company in total system deliveries when Hankook Tire of Korea, one of the world‚Äôs leading tire manufacturers, ordered an automation system for its new tire factory in Hungary. The deal, worth almost 20 million euros, was one of the biggest in Cimcorp‚Äôs history. By 2008 the tire industry had become the most important customer segment for the company, whereas the food & beverage sector accounted for one third of the company‚Äôs net sales of 30 million euros. At that time, Cimcorp employed a staff of 150. Cimcorp founded a new company, CimSolar Oy, to develop an automation system for solar panel manufacturing based on thin film technology. CimSolar Oy, a member of the Cimcorp Group, later changed its name to Cimcontracting Oy. In the summer of 2010, Cimcorp bought the Canadian robotics company RMT Robotics Ltd. RMT Robotics was renamed Cimcorp Automation Ltd at the beginning of 2015.  2014‚Äì Cimcorp of Murata Machinery In the summer of 2014 the Japanese family-owned company Murata Machinery bought Cimcorp and its subsidiaries Cimcontracting Oy and RMT Robotics Ltd. Cimcorp Group then had around 300 employees worldwide. Murata Machinery employed about 6300 people and its net sales were over 1.6 billion euros. In 2015 Cimcorp employed 230 people in Finland. It received the largest order in its history when the Chinese tire manufacturer Sentury Tire bought an automation system worth close to 30 million euros for its new car tire factory in Thailand. In 2016 the company doubled its net sales compared to 2012. In 2017 the company employed approximately 400 people. Cimcorp hired 40-50 new employees annually from 2016-2018. In the summer of 2018 it was announced that Cimcorp would build new premises for about 200 engineers, almost doubling the existing production and office space at company headquarters. In spring 2019 Cimcorp opened a new office in Chennai, India. The office will focus on the automation of Indian tire factories. In May 2019 it was announced that the largest grocery retailer in Spain, Mercadona, had ordered fresh produce order picking automation from Cimcorp for its four distribution centers. The value of the giant deal was over 120 million euros and was evaluated to take 1,000 person- years to produce, half of which will be done at Cimcorp and half in its subcontracting chain. Cimcorp had first supplied Mercadona with automation in 2013.  Organization  Cimcorp Group is owned by Murata Machinery, Ltd. of Japan. Cimcorp‚Äôs headquarters is located in Ulvila, Finland and has subsidiaries in Canada, the US, India and Spain. In Finland, Cimcorp has service points in Helsinki, Lahti, and Jyv√§skyl√§. In spring 2019, 330 employees were working at Ulvila and 100 in North America. There were around ten employees in India, in Spain and in the Finnish service points. In 2020 Cimcorp employed over 500 people.  Products  By 2019, Cimcorp had supplied its products to over 40 countries in over 6 continents. Its clients include the tire companies Continental, Goodyear, Cordiant, and Tigar Tyres. A tire manufacturing line automated with robots produced by Cimcorp changes the personnel requirement, as where previously 50 factory operators would be needed to take care of a line, only around 20 engineers are needed after automation. The tire industry accounted for approx. 75 percent of net sales in 2017, with the US accounting for a third. In 2018, the tire industry still accounted for over a half, but the share of the food & beverage industry was showing fast growth. Corporate clients also include ICA, the largest food retail chain in Sweden, Sinebrychoff and Valio where Cimcorp gantry robots pick half of the dairy products flowing through the warehouses at the Riihim√§ki and Jyv√§skyl√§ plants.

He called it Obamagate and cryptically contended: He continued: Trump claims that Obama and his administration somehow abused presidential authority to skew the 2016 election to hurt Trump's presidential campaign and help Hillary Clinton. Trump and his supporters have made the baseless allegations that his predecessor President Barack Obama and his administration conspired to politically surveil, ‚Äútapped wires‚Äù, ‚Äúspied on‚Äù his campaign, and worked ‚Äúto entrap‚Äù Trump campaign officials through inappropriate investigations by the Department of Justice, the United States Intelligence Community, and the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. David Harsanyi, an American conservative writer, in an opinion piece for the Detroit News, contends that Obamagate is not a conspiracy theory. Trump‚Äôs grievances against Obama have been thoroughly debunked. Background According to the results of a U.S. Senate investigation, the government of Russia directly and through intermediaries sought influence within 2016 U.S. presidential election candidate Donald Trump's political campaigns and also to sow discord within American society. Thus, actions taken by the then-current Obama Administration in its investigations into these alleged Russian influences provide the bases for claims that it spied on Trump.

Trump's reply was: \\"Obamagate. It's been going on for a long time ... from before I even got elected and it's a disgrace that it happened.... Some terrible things happened and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again.\\" When Rucker again asked what the crime was, Trump said: \\"You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.\\" On May 15, Trump tweeted that Obamagate was the \\"greatest political scandal in the history of the United States\\". This was the third time Trump claimed to be suffering from a scandal of such magnitude, after previously giving Spygate and the Russia investigation similar labels. Also on May 15, Trump linked Obamagate to the \\"persecution\\" of Michael Flynn, and a missing 302 form. Trump called for Congress to summon Obama to testify about \\"the biggest political crime\\". Senator Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that he did not expect to summon Obama, but would summon other Obama administration officials. Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr stated that he did not \\"expect\\" Obama to be investigated of a crime. Some of Trump's allies have suggested that the \\"crime\\" involved the FBI launching an investigation into incoming national security advisor Michael Flynn, or possibly the \\"unmasking\\" by outgoing Obama officials to find out the name of a person who was reported in intelligence briefings to be conversing with the Russian ambassador. In a May 2020 op-ed at the news website RealClearPolitics, Charles Lipson, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Chicago analyzed the content of \\"Obamagate\\". He claimed that the concept refers to three accusations: (1) The Obama administration conducted mass surveillance through the NSA; (2) the Obama administration used surveillance against Trump's 2016 presidental campaign, and (3) the Obama administration did not transfer power seamlessly to the new Trump administration. Lipson further claimed that \\"these abuses didn‚Äôt simply follow each other; their targets, goals, and principal players overlapped. Taken together, they represent some of the gravest violations of constitutional norms and legal protections in American history\\". The Associated Press (AP) in May 2020 addressed Obamagate in a fact check, stating that there was \\"no evidence\\" of Trump's suggestion that \\"the disclosure of Flynn's name as part of legal U.S. surveillance of foreign targets was criminal and motivated by partisan politics.\\" AP stated that there is not only \\"nothing illegal about unmasking,\\" but also that the unmasking of Flynn was approved using the National Security Agency's \\"standard process.\\" Unmasking is allowed if officials feel that it is needed to understand the collected intelligence. AP further pointed out that the Trump administration was conducting even more unmasking than the Obama administration in the final year of Obama's presidency. In May, attorney general Bill Barr appointed federal prosecutor John Bash to examine unmasking conducted by the Obama administration. August 2020: Yates testimony during Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation The concept underlies in part a 2020 U.S. Senate investigation into the 2016-onward FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation.Inspector General Report, December 2019, p. 2: \\"On August 16, 2016, the FBI opened a fourth individual case under Crossfire Hurricane on Michael Flynn, who was serving at the time as the Trump campaign's National Security Advisor.\\" Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates on August 5, 2020, testified before the Committee that investigators were concerned that the national security adviser to president elect Trump, Michael Flynn, was conversing in private with the Russian ambassador. According to Yates, Obama was interested in whether Flynn ought to be considered a safe recipient for sensitive briefings and Obama \\"did not in any way attempt to direct or influence any kind of investigation. Something like that would have set off alarms for me.\\" (According to news reports, a belief that Flynn may have violated the Logan Act - a rarely prosecuted and vague law which constrains individuals from countervailing the existing foreign policy of the United States by way of secretive meetings - that supplied the initial rationale for the FBI to target Flynn.) September 2020: Johnson comments and accusations of political motives Accusations have been leveled that Senate Republicans are using investigations of \\"Obamagate\\" to help provide the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign with talking points. In September, Sen. Ron Johnson, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, led Republicans on the committee in securing subpoenas to look into Trump's Obamagate claims. Johnson had received criticism for stating \\"the more that we expose of the corruption of the transition process between Obama and Trump, the more we expose of the corruption within those agencies, I would think it would certainly help Donald Trump win reelection and certainly be pretty good, I would say, evidence about not voting for Vice President Biden\\". October 2020: Trump pushes for arrests With the news that U.S. Attorney John Durham's investigation into potential abuses within the Obama's administration's handling of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation would not produce a report or indictments before the 2020 presidential election, President Trump began publicly calling on Attorney General Bill Barr to arrest major political figures he believes were involved, including his 2020 opponent Joe Biden. The unmasking inquiry begun in May concluded in October with no findings of substantive wrongdoing.

Historical background  According to Catholic and Orthodox belief, Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, did not die but rather ascended to heaven during her lifetime or entered directly into the glory of God (what we would commonly translate as \\"ascent to heaven\\"). According to the story, the procession took place in Ephesus, in the house of the apostle John, which is also referred to as the House of the Virgin Mary. All over the world, and for centuries, Christians have celebrated the procession annually on the 15th of August, the date of the consecration in Jerusalem of the first church dedicated to Mary in the fifth century, after the Council of Ephesus (431).  The celebration = History  In italian popular culture, our Lady of Trapani is the protector of the Italian city of Trapani in Sicily. It has been worshiped by the Italian and Sicilian community of La Goulette since its arrival in the sixteenth century. In 1848, a church was built following a donation of land from Ahmed Bey. The building was initially dedicated to Saint Fid√®le, patron of Fid√®le Sutter, apostolic vicar of Tunis from 1844 to 1881. However, and considering the diversity of the local Christian community, the space got divided and each of the three chapels got dedicated to a Virgin Mary: Our lady of Lourdes, Our Lady of Mont-Carmel and Our lady of Trapani for the French, Maltese and Italians.  Activities  The celebration changed before and after Tunisia's independence. According to the archives of the Catholic Church, it reached its peak in 1909. It used to begin with the exit of the Madonna from the church on the shoulders of believers, who make her cross the streets of La Goulette, walking up to Tunis, all accompanied by a musical troupes. Some people used to follow this procession barefoot, to fulfill a wish. Then a fireworks show and a concert on Ahmed Bey square in La Goulette took place. According to popular culture, the prostitutes of the city came in the evening, accompanied by their pimps, to prostrate themselves at the feet of the cross, thus performing the so-called rite of the Madeleine. The festivities take place simultaneously in Trapani in the same way, but what distinguishes the Tunisian version is the diversity of the participants who, in addition to Christians, also include Muslims and Jews in Tunis. The latter even attend mass inside the church. The tradition of the procession was abandoned in the 1960s, due to the decrease in the number of Christians living in La Goulette, and until 2017, when the celebration resumed after Mass, but in a less visible way, in the interior courtyard of the church.  The festival in popular culture  The procession of the Trapani Madonna was represented in the last scene of the Ferid Boughdir's film A Summer in La Goulette.

In recognition of her contributions to Sami culture, in 2019 she was elected an honorary member of the Sami Cultural Association (Samisk Kunstnerforbund, SDS) One of her most celebrated works is Gudni II (Homage II), a sculpture she created in 2016 on the trunk of a pine tree in the Art Park of Ii, Finland. Biography Born in November 1948 near Repv√•gstranda in the Nordkapp Municipality, she was brought up by parents who only spoke Sami at home, considering it important for her to use the native language rather than Norwegian. She was possibly the last child in the area to have Sami as her mother tongue as those born after 1953 were raised in Norwegian. From 1955, she attended the Norwegian-speaking boarding school in Repv√•gstranda where her elder brother Oliver helped her with Norwegian. After the school was closed in 1957, she continued her education at the Solvang boarding school in Sarnes, continuing at the junior high school in Honningsv√•g and at the high school in Alta. She went on to study Sami at the University of Oslo but the \\"standard\\" Sami she learnt was quite different from her mother tongue. She then studied at the Trondheim Art School, first developing her drawing but soon specializing in sculpture. Utsi now works mainly as a sculptor with a combination of materials including wood, plastic, stone and metal. She explains her approach as follows: > \\"When I am working with three-dimensional wooden objects, I almost never > make any sketches. I work directly with the material and let it talk to my > mind, my eyes and hands. In many ways, I can ‚Äòsee‚Äô the result by letting the > material be my guide, but there are surprises or demands in the wood itself, > and I have to take that into consideration. While shaping the material, it > grows and becomes my piece of art.\\" Utsi's work has been exhibited widely and is in the permanent collections of various museums. In October 2008, several of her works were presented in a solo exhibition arranged by the Alta Cultural Association. These included a series of her drawings expressing ideas of \\"timeless time\\" as well as a floor- based installation combining metal and plexiglass.

At this time the former Eastern Province District had been expanded to include Haut-U√©l√©, Bas-U√©l√© and Aruwimi. He replaced Alexis Bertrand, interim governor after Justin Malfeyt had left office as deputy governor-general of Orientale Province in July 1916. De Meulemeester took office on 15 August 1917. In 1925 his title was upgraded to governor and deputy governor-general. De Meulemeester was responsible for the controversial development of a road network in Orientale Province, and for development of cotton cultivation. He started the first native courts, and the first councils of chiefdoms and sectors, giving the local people some say in managing their own affairs. These would be formalized by decrees of 1926 and 1933, and would spread across the Congo. He established rural dispensaries and promoted expansion of primary and vocational schools for the local people. He had great tenacity in implementing his plans for the province, and was constantly on the move inspecting the works. His most severe condemnation of a staff member was \\"does not like to travel\\". Adolphe de Meulemeester retired on 22 June 1926. He was succeeded by Alfred Alphonse Moeller (1889‚Äì1971). Later years (1926‚Äì1944) On 14‚Äì21 September 1926 De Meulemeester attended the International Conference on the Christian Mission in Africa, in Zoute, Belgium. There he attended a session on race relations with Alberto de Oliveira, the Portuguese minister of foreign affairs, Louis Franck, Frederick Lugard and the Brazilian intellectual Erasmo de Carvalho Braga. Oliveira claimed that Portugal had already worked out the \\"great problems of the relations between races\\" in Brazil, and Angola and Mozambique would develop into new Brazils. On 7 July 1932 De Meulemeester married Marie-Jeanne Vansteensel Vanderaa. They divorced on 6 October 1936, and on 2 February 1938 he married Marie-Henriette Dor. De Meulemeester died in Brussels on 10 May 1944. A report of his death summarized his achievements as building a remarkable network of roads in Stanleyville Province and introducing cotton cultivation in several regions of the Congo.

He is a creator of a documentary film Article Eighteen, co-founder of the Equality March in Lublin association and Mi≈Ço≈õƒá Nie Wyklucza foundation, which promotes same-sex marriage in Poland. Activism=Lublin Pride 2018 Equality March in Lublin In 2018 Staszewski was the formal organizer of the First Equality March in Lublin, scheduled for 13 October. On 9 October, the President of Lublin, Krzysztof ≈ªuk, banned both the Equality March and the counter-meetings announced against it, citing a law which allows banning a public gathering due to the threat to life, health or property of people. Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar criticized the decision, stating that it went against the Polish Constitution's guarantee of freedom of assembly. Previously the European Court of Human Rights held that bans on pride marches violate the European Convention of Human Rights after mayor Lech Kaczy≈Ñski tried to ban the Equality Parade in Warsaw on the same grounds. Staszewski appealed against the prohibition decision to the district court, which upheld it. It was revoked the day before the March by the appellate court. In April 2019, the Association for Equality March in Lublin (Stowarzyszenie Marsz R√≥wno≈õci w Lublinie) was established, whose goal is to act for the benefit of LGBT communities in Lublin and the Lublin Province, including the organization of the equality march. Similarly to the situation in the previous year, on 24 September 2019, Krzysztof ≈ªuk issued a ban of the Second Equality March in Lublin, planned for 28 September. Staszewski, as the organizer of the March, appealed against his decision to the court, which reversed the ban two days later. Rainbow flag of Poland Rainbow flag of Poland at the 2018 Equality March in Czƒôstochowa (Staszewski on the left) Polish rainbow flag by itself During the March in Czƒôstochowa in 2018, Bartosz Staszewski carried the Polish flag with a white eagle on a rainbow background. According to conservative and right-wing circles, such a display constituted an insult to the state symbols, and the Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Joachim Brudzi≈Ñski accused Staszewski of desecrating the national symbols of Poland. Brudzi≈Ñski's actions triggered protests of the LGBT community under the slogan Rainbow does not offend (Tƒôcza nie obra≈ºa), the prosecutor's office refused to initiate an investigation due to the lack of signs of a criminal act. This case popularized this version of the flag among the LGBT community. Defamation case In 2018, Law and Justice councillor Tomasz Pitucha claimed that the Lublin equality march promotes pedophilia. Staszewski, as the organizer of the march, brought an action against Pitucha for defamation. The latter was convicted and had to pay PLN 5,000 to the Lublin equality march association. LGBT-free zones On 24 July 2019, the conservative weekly newspaper Gazeta Polska started to distribute 'LGBT-free zone' stickers. In response to this action, Staszewski filed a lawsuit for the violation of personal rights against the newspaper together with a motion to withdraw the stickers. The Regional Court in Warsaw ordered that the distribution of stickers be suspended until the case is considered by the court. In response to discriminatory resolutions of local governments, which have declared themselves zones free of the 'LGBT ideology', Staszewski carried out a photographic project in which he takes pictures of signs marking the entrance to the village with the 'LGBT Free Zone' sign, which refers to real road signs. In some of the photos, he additionally portrays LGBT people who live in the 'zone'.  August 2020 LGBT protests in Poland  On 7 August 2020, Staszewski was one of the people arrested during \\"August 2020 LGBT protests in Poland\\" mass arrest, which he called \\"a turning point for the entire Poland\\". In September 2020, he was chosen by the Obama Foundation to participate in the Leaders: Europe 2020 program as one of 35 \\"emerging leaders working in government, civil society, and the private sector who have demonstrated a commitment to advancing the common good\\".

She was the first female professor at the Leiden University, the first female Humanities professor in the Netherlands and during her career was one of the few Greek women to hold a position at a European university.  Early life  Antoniadis was born on 31 July 1895 in Piraeus. Her family was originally from Crete, descending from the Byzantine family of Melissinos. Her father, Andreas Antoniadis, was a lawyer in Piraeus; while her mother, Efrosini Leli, belonged to a well-known family from Athens. She completed her basic education by attending classes at the Greek-French School of Aikaterini Diamantopoulou. The outbreak of the First World War delayed her studies, but eventually she went to Paris to study Greek and French literature at the Sorbonne. She graduated with a degree in Classics in 1920.  Career  Antoniadis returned to Greece and in 1922, published her first work The Sacrifice of Abraham. From 1924-26 she lectured on Modern Greek Literature at the Vocational School of Theatre. In 1929 she was appointed as Chair in Early Christian, Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature at Leiden University, succeeding Dirk Christiaan Hesseling. On 13 November she gave her acceptance speech to a crowded hall; present were the Greek Consul to Rotterdam, as well as the heir to the Dutch throne, Princess Juliana, who enrolled in Antoniadis' classes. Under the supervision of Hubert Pernot, she was awarded a PhD in 1930 from the University of Paris-Sorbonne, with the thesis: L 'ƒñvangile de Luc. Esquisse de grammaire et de style - an examination the Gospel of Luke. She also published a supplementary dissertation on Pascal as a translator of the Bible. In 1935 she was elected to a part-time professorship in Early Christian, Medieval and Modern Greek Language at the University of Leiden, replacing the Dutch Byzantine scholar N K Hesseling. In 1951 she became a full professor at the same chair, making her Leiden University's first female professor. During the Second World War, Antoniadis returned to Greece. During the war she was a member of the Resistance and her house on Xenofontos Street in Syntagma became one of their meeting places. In 1946 she advertised her availability for teaching in the News Bulletin of the Institute of International Education. In 1948 she was elected at the University of Amsterdam in the Chair of Modern Greek Language and Literature. In 1955 she became Director at the Hellenic Institute of Byzantine and Post- Byzantine Studies in Venice. During her time in Venice she contributed to the renovation of buildings such as the Flanginian School and San Giorgio dei Greci, where she founded a museum. She remained in there until 1966, when she retired to Athens. Antoniadis died on 25 January 1972 in Athens.  Research  Sign at Leiden University Antoniadis' research explored the connections between Greek literature in the ancient, Byzantine and modern periods, with a particular focus on the place of liturgy. She also published a textbook in Dutch on how to learn the Greek language.Antoniadis, Sophia. \\"Het dagboek een te Amsterdam gevestigde Griekse koopman.\\" Tijdschrift voor Geschiedenis 69.1 (1956): 57-66. Her 1939 volume on the place of the liturgy in the tradition of Greek letter-writing was an important work, which proved that the Orthodox liturgy had its roots in classical and post-classical literature. Her work included studies of Pascal's Bible translation, the Ptochoprodromika by the 12th-century Byzantine writer Theodoros Prodromos, as well as on Erotokritos and the Sacrifice of Abraham by an unknown Venetian-Cretan poet of the 15th century. She was seen as a thorough and meticulous scholar.  Selected publications  * Place de la liturgie dans la tradition de lettres grecques (Leiden, 1939) * De l'influence de la langue du droit byzantin sur le grec d'aujourd'hui (Brussels, 1932)  Honours  In 1950 she was honoured with the Gold Cross of the Order of Beneficence and the Order of the Order of the Phoenix, while the Academy of Athens elected her a corresponding member. When she left the University of Leiden, her colleagues and students dedicated an honorary volume to her entitled Antidoron.  Legacy  For many years Antoniadis' portrait was the only one of a woman to hang in the Senate Chamber at Leiden University, however in 2018, to celebrate International Women's Day, her portrait was joined by 14 others for the first time. There were 117 male portraits on display still.

Gam-COVID-Vac was approved for distribution in Russia, despite having been tested only in a small number of people in early-stage clinical trials that lasted two months, normally a process requiring a year or more of clinical assessment for proof of vaccine safety and efficacy against viral disease. The quick approval of Gam-COVID-Vac was initially criticized as premature, in order to claim being the first country to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. Protests developed in the international scientific community over announcement of the vaccine registration, mainly because there was initially no publication of results from clinical trials on Gam-COVID-Vac. Although Phase I-II results were eventually published on 4 September 2020, the pivotal Phase III trial a necessary scientific step to prove vaccine safety and efficacy in thousands of individuals had not yet been conducted. At the time of Gam-COVID-Vac's registration in Russia after early trials, several other vaccine candidates were already being evaluated in interventional Phase III trials involving thousands of participants. In most countries following guidelines of the World Health Organization, vaccine candidates are not approved or licensed until safety and efficacy data from Phase III trials are assessed and confirmed internationally by regulators. The phase III trial for Gam-COVID-Vac was registered with the US National Library of Medicine on 28 August 2020, and its status was updated to \\"recruiting\\" on 10 September. The study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical trial involving 40,000 volunteers and is scheduled to run for six months. Russian officials reported that at least 20 countries were interested in obtaining the Russian vaccine. According to the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Russia will be able to produce more than one billion doses a year in five countries.  Technology  Gam-COVID-Vac is a viral two-vector vaccine based on the human adenovirus ‚Äî a common cold virus ‚Äî fused with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to stimulate an immune response. The Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine candidate was developed by a government organisation that worked on previous coronavirus vaccine candidates. The recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) and adenovirus type-26 (Ad26) are both used as vectors in the vaccine. The Ad26 based vaccine is used on the first day and the Ad5 vaccine is used on the 21st day to boost response.  Development and registration  Putin's meeting with Government members, on 11 August 2020 via videoconference, at which he announced a conditionally registered vaccine against COVID-19. In May 2020, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology announced that it had developed the vaccine. The vaccine was given the trade name \\"Sputnik V\\", after the Soviet-era artificial satellite. On 11 August, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced regulatory approval of the vaccine, even before the vaccine candidate had been entered into Phase III trials to prove it is safe and effective against COVID-19, and prevents infection in the general population. According to Deutsches √Ñrzteblatt, only 38 participants had been studied in two small trials before the registration was issued, leading to criticism by a spokesperson for the German Federal Ministry of Health that there had been no publication of data in a peer-reviewed journal before the registration was issued. The registration certificate for the vaccine stated that it cannot be used widely in Russia until 1 January 2021, and before that, it may be provided to \\"a small number of citizens from vulnerable groups\\", such as medical staff and the elderly. Early government approval of the vaccine candidate resulted in international protest that clinical safety guidelines had not been followed, and that vaccine candidates for an infectious disease in a Phase I-II trial (the stage of research where Gam-COVID-Vac was reported in July 2020) have a success rate of only 16%. A vaccine candidate has only a 40% and 7% chance of passing from a Phase I trial to regulatory approval for industry-sponsored and non-industry-sponsored vaccine development programs, respectively. Without Phase III trials, it is unknown whether the vaccine is effective or safe for vaccinating the public. Preliminary clinical research A Phase I safety trial began on 18 June. On 4 September, data on 76 participants in a Phase I-II trial were published, indicating preliminary evidence of safety and an immune response, but the results were challenged by international vaccine scientists as being incomplete, suspicious, and unreliable when identical data were reported for many of the trial participants. Scientific assessment On 11 August 2020, a World Health Organization spokesperson said, \\"Prequalification of any vaccine includes the rigorous review and assessment of all required safety and efficacy data... You cannot use a vaccine or drugs or medicines without following through all of these stages, having complied with all of these stages.\\" Vaccine scientists, Peter Hotez and Francois Balloux, have called the Russian government's approval of Gam-COVID-Vac \\"worrying\\", \\"reckless\\" and \\"foolish\\". Professor Paul Offit, who is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia, stated that the announcement was a \\"political stunt\\", and that the untested vaccine could be very harmful. Svetlana Zavidova, Executive Director of the Russian Association of Clinical Research Organizations, said, \\"It's ridiculous, I feel only shame for our country.\\" The association wrote in an appeal that \\"Accelerated registration will no longer make Russia a leader in this race, it will only expose end users of the vaccine, citizens of the country of the Russian Federation, to unnecessary danger.\\" Balram Bhargava, director of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said that Russia has managed to fast track a COVID-19 vaccine candidate through its early phases. Public perception In September 2020, at the start of the public school year in Russia, a small 700-member teachers union recommended to its members that the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine be refused out of concern that it had not been adequately assessed for safety and efficacy. Although vaccinations among Russia's 1.2 million teachers are voluntary, the union claimed that vaccination with the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine should not be made mandatory unless clinical trials are completed, with a union spokesperson saying: \\"Firstly, it is generally known that the quality of domestic vaccines is worse than that of foreign ones. Secondly, the vaccine was created at railway speed, which already raises concerns. It was created in haste.\\" According to public opinion polls, only half of the Russian population would take the vaccine voluntarily. An opinion poll of Canadians conducted by L√©ger found that a majority (68%) would not take the Russian vaccine if offered a free dose, compare to 14% who said they would take it. British and American officials stated that the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine would likely be rejected due to concerns that the normally rigorous process of vaccine clinical testing was not followed. One public health expert said the quick approval of Gam-COVID-Vac by the Russian government was \\"cutting corners\\", and may harm public confidence if the vaccine proves to be unsafe or ineffective. \\"There is a huge risk that confidence in vaccines would be damaged by a vaccine that received approval and was then shown to be harmful\\", said immunologist Peter Openshaw.

She became interested in portrait miniatures while living in Edinburgh in the late 1950s and was encouraged to publish her research as her knowledge on the subject grew. Foskett published seven books and one exhibition catalogue during her career. She conducted lecture tours and was a contributor to some periodicals. Foskett's large photographic archive was sent to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery on a long-term loan in 2003 and her miniatures were catalogued in the same year. Early life Foskett was born at Shoddesden, Kimpton, Hampshire on 23 December 1911. She was the daughter of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry captain John William Carnegie Kirk and his wife, Agnes Maud Haynes, Kirk. Foskett was of Scottish ancestry through her paternal grandfather, John Kirk, the botanist and physician. She grew up primarily in Sevenoaks, Kent, and was taught at the private St Ives School, Bexhill, Sussex, but did not have any formal qualifications when she left the school. Foskett was as a matron at a Kent preparatory school in the mid-1930s. She worked in the Nottinghamshire parishes of Rainworth from 1937 to 1943 before moving to Ordsall until 1947. Foskett later moved to work in Ilkeston, Derbyshire from 1948 to 1956. These years saw her get heavily involved with the Girl Guides, the Mothers' Union and the Young Wifes. Career While living in Edinburgh during the late 1950s, Foskett became interested in portrait miniatures, and assisted the miniatures dealer Arthur Tite at the annual Grosvenor House art fair. As her knowledge on the subject grew, she was encouraged to publish her research, and published British Portrait Miniatures: A History in 1963. Foskett followed with the first monograph on the 18th-century miniaturist John Smart the following year. As with several other researchers, she misidentified Smart's place of birth as Norfolk when he was born in Soho. In 1965, the Scottish committee of the Arts Council invited her to curate the coinciding Edinburgh International Festival exhibition ‚ÄòBritish Portrait Miniatures‚Äô at Rothesay Terrace. Foskett was appointed a governor of St. Anne's School, Windermere in 1971. The next year, she authored the two-volume A Dictionary of British Miniature Painters containing biographical information on more than 4,500 portrait miniaturists. Foskett published two monographs and an exhibition catalogue in Samuel Cooper, 1609‚Äì1672, John Harden of Brathay Hall, 1772‚Äì1847 and Samuel Cooper and His Contemporaries. She republished A Dictionary of British Miniature Painters together with a new edition of Collecting Miniatures to compile the single-volume Miniatures: Dictionary and Guide in 1979. In 1981, Foskett wrote her eighth piece of work, Elizabethan Miniatures. She was a consultant on the ‚ÄòArtists of the Tudor Court‚Äô exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1983 and authored an unpublished but completed manuscript on a major period of the portrait miniature. In 1987, Foskett's final book, Miniatures: Dictionary and Guide, was published for the Antique Collectors' Club in Woodbridge, Suffolk, and was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Miniature Society. She contributed to the periodicals Antique Dealer, Apollo, Collector's Guide and The Connoisseur. Foskett was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and was a member of the Royal Over-Seas League and Theta Sigma Phi. She went on lecture tours to London and the United States, and built up a large photographic archive as well as conducting international correspondence on a wide scale. In 1990, the artist Heather O. Catchpole made a watercolour on ivorine portrait miniature of Foskett. Personal life Foskett was a member of the Church of England. She was married to the curate and bishop Reginald Foskett from 7 April 1937 until his death in 1973. They had two daughters. She died in the Solihull Parkway Hospital on 15 June 1998. Legacy According to Stephen Lloyd in Foskett's Dictionary of National Biography entry and obituary in The Scotsman, she had succeeded in bringing portrait miniatures closer to art collectors, art connoisseurs and the general public. Following her death, her photographic archive and much of her art collection was placed on long-term loan at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh in 2003.

Fletcher joined the East India Company as a junior clerk in 1757 but soon transferred to its army. As a lieutenant he was cashiered (dismissed) for insolence but was later restored. Fletcher was awarded a knighthood for gallantry in battle and rose in rank to lieutenant-colonel in command of a brigade. He was court-martialled and cashiered for the second time by Robert Clive for involvement in the 1766 Monghyr Mutiny. Returning to Britain Fletcher, during the 1768 general election, stood unsuccessfully at Malmesbury before finding a seat at Cricklade. In parliament, he opposed the government of William Pitt before he was restored to service with the East India Company after the intercession of a fellow MP. He afterwards voted in support of the government. Fletcher returned to India in 1772 to command the Madras Army. He soon came into conflict with the presidency's governor Josias Du Pre, after which Fletcher chose to leave India and return to Britain. He considered standing at the 1774 British general election but withdrew the day before the poll. Returning to India in 1775, Fletcher again came into conflict with the governor, Lord Pigot, which culminated in Pigot's arrest. Sick with tuberculosis, Fletcher undertook a sea voyage to convalesce but died at Mauritius during his travels. Early life and career Robert Fletcher was born circa 1738 to Robert Fletcher and Elizabeth Fletcher (n√©e Lyon). During his youth his father served as a major in Lord Ogilvy's regiment of the Jacobite Army during the rising of 1745. After the defeat of the Jacobites, he fled to Bergen, Norway and did not return to Scotland until 1754. The young Robert Fletcher was appointed a writer in the service of the East India Company at Madras in May 1757. He transferred to the company's army as an ensign in September and was promoted to lieutenant. He was cashiered (dismissed from the service) for insolence, but the intervention of senior officer Eyre Coote restored him to his position. Fletcher, who served during the Seven Years' War, was promoted to captain in 1760. He returned to England in 1763 and was knighted on 29 December for his gallantry in action. He was promoted to major in 1764 and lieutenant-colonel in 1765. He returned to India in command of a brigade and was implicated in the 1766 Monghyr Mutiny. Court-martialled and cashiered again by Robert Clive, he returned to England.  Political career  Upon his return Fletcher sought a seat in Parliament. After first considering Bridport in Dorset he stood, with William Mayne, for the two seats at Malmesbury in the 1768 British general election. The pair garnered just two votes apiece (out of 13 electors) to the 11 won by the Earl of Donegall and Thomas Howard. Undaunted he passed through Cricklade, Wiltshire, just days before the election there and, finding a relative of Clive had declined a seat there, won it on 16 March 1768 without any expenditure whatsoever. The seat is thought to have cost him ¬£4,000 in promised payments to the electors. The second seat went to George Damer, son of the wealthy Lord Milton. In parliament Fletcher voted generally in support of the opposition to the government of William Pitt but primarily acted in the interest of his restoration to the East India Company. He had failed to achieve this, by some 30 votes, at the company's General court earlier in the year. Fellow MP George Grenville interceded on his behalf with Clive, who dropped his opposition, and on 15 December 1769 Fletcher was reinstated and promoted to colonel. Though formally posted to Madras, he did not sail until 1771 and in the meantime came to support the government in parliament.  First return to India  Upon arrival in 1772 Fletcher assumed command of the Madras Army from Brigadier General Joseph Smith. Within months Fletcher was in conflict with the company's governor of Madras Josias Du Pre. This came to a head in January 1773 when Du Pre dismissed Fletcher from the council and ordered him to Trichinopoly to keep him out of the city. Fletcher took the opportunity, in March 1773, to leave India. Around this time he wrote to friends in England to ask them to lobby for his appointment as Commander-in-Chief, India, which was not successful. Fletcher took part in parliamentary business in 1774, including voting against extending the Parliamentary Elections Act 1770 perpetually. He stated in the House of Commons on 28 February that he would press for an inquiry into the business of the East India Company. The Company afterwards re-engaged his services, promoting him to brigadier-general in April 1774 and posting him to Madras once more. Fletcher postponed travelling to contest Cricklade at the 1774 British general election but withdrew the day before the poll. He married Anne Pybus, the daughter of a banker, on 17 December 1774.  Second return to India  Lord Pigot, depicted in 1777 Fletcher arrived in Madras in June 1775 and soon came into conflict with the governor, now Lord Pigot. In October 1775 he once again assumed the role of Commander of the Madras Army and received, ex officio, a seat on the council of the Madras Presidency. Fletcher was among the majority of the council that opposed Pigot, and after Pigot expelled the opposition and took possession of Fort St. George he was arrested by the opposition. Fletcher, who was then ill with tuberculosis, left India in October 1776 aboard the Greenwich on a journey of convalescence. He died at Mauritius on 24 December. In April 1777 George III, unaware of Fletcher's death, wrote \\"Sir Robert Fletcher appears with his usual inclination to disputes\\" with regards the Pigot affair. Fletcher left a large fortune that allegedly included a large parcel of pearls from an Indian nawab.

Because of his wounds, he was unable to stand, unless assisted. What his first biographer, James Redpath, called John Brown's last speech was delivered on November 2, 1859, at his sentencing, in a packed courtroom, after his conviction for murder, treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, and inciting a slave insurrection. According to Ralph Waldo Emerson, this speech's only equal in American oratory is the Gettysburg Address. Content Virginia court procedure required that those found guilty should be asked if there was any reason sentence should not be imposed. Asked this by the clerk, Brown immediately rose, and in a clear, distinct voice said: Reactions to Brown's speech broadside) of John Brown's last speech, published by Wm. Lloyd Garrison Thanks to the recently invented telegraph, reporters at the trial sent out immediate copy. Brown's speech, presumably recorded by a stenographer such as newspapers used for important speeches, was distributed by the Associated Press and was the next day, November 3, on the front page of the New York Times, the Richmond Dispatch, the Detroit Free Press, the Milwaukee Daily Sentinel, and other newspapers. Over the next few days it appeared in full in some 50 other papers across the country (see below). Wm. Lloyd Garrison printed it as a poster (broadside) and had it for sale in The Liberator's office in Boston. The American Anti-Slavery Society published it in a pamphlet, together with extracts from Brown's letters. A verse on the title page: \\"He, being dead, yet speaketh\\" (), compares Brown with Abel, killed by Cain. That evening, as many of the papers reported together with Brown's speech, the abolitionist Wendell Phillips gave a speech in Brooklyn, in Henry Ward Beecher's Plymouth Church, an important abolitionist center and Underground Railroad station. While the talk had been scheduled in advance, the topic of John Brown had not been announced, and was a surprise to those present. According to Phillips, in the lead story on page 1 of the New York Herald: Modern commentary Brown's speech contains what two modern writers have called \\"lies\\"; Alfred Kazin called it Brown's \\"great, lying speech\\". It is not correct that he helped slaves escape from Missouri \\"without the snapping of a gun on either side\\". One man, David Cruise, was killed. And his statement that he was not trying to start a slave insurrection does not jibe with many other comments he made before the raid. Yet according to Brown's biographer David S. Reynolds, \\"the Gettysburg Address similarly glossed over disturbing details in the interest of making a higher point. Lincoln left out the bloody horrors of the Civil War, just as Brown minimized his bloody tactics.\\" With this speech, both North and South stopped seeing Brown as only an irritating extremist. It was clear that he was a Christian, and he was an American. The South scrambled to denounce him as a villain, pure and simple. The North began to regard him as a hero. The need to abolish slavery was no longer a fringe position in the North. The cross ‚Ä† indicates that the speech appeared on page 1.

It is now in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 2146. It is the most famous of the circa 1,500 (!) portrait paintings by Largilli√®re, and arguably the most iconic work in the Strasbourg museum. The identity of the depicted woman is unknown: she may be someone from the Strasbourg bourgeoisie, or a young Parisian in disguise (Strasbourg had become part of France only 22 years prior, in 1681), or the painter's own sister, Marie Elisabeth de Largilli√®re. The costume she is wearing was fashionable in the Strasbourg patriarchy between 1688 and 1730. The painting had always enjoyed the highest esteem. The list of its former owners is prestigious: it had belonged to Ange Laurent Lalive de Jully, then to C√©sar Gabriel de Choiseul, and later to Fran√ßois Coty; in the interval, it had also hung in the Ch√¢teau de Bussy-Rabutin. The Strasbourg museums tried to acquire it in 1936, but did not succeed; in 1963, a second effort, with the help of C√©cile de Rothschild (1913‚Äì1995), and a public subscription, was successful. The painting was bought at Sotheby's in London on 3 July 1963 for the then very considerable sum of 145,000 British pounds (), or 1,999,000 French francs at the time. The museum finally paid 1,725,500 French francs, thanks to a deduction agreed by the owner, Violet Leah Fitzgerald, and Sotheby's. It was still the highest price paid by a French museum for the purchase of a work of art until that date. Not everybody in Strasbourg was enthusiastic ‚Äì , a local politician who was also a noted painter, called it \\"a fake masterpiece\\", \\"the too beautiful and too costly Strasbourg Woman\\", \\"a sugary painting with the elegance of a retouched photo, mostly suited for the taste of nouveaux riches\\", etc. In 1967, Heitz painted a bitter parody of the portrait, called La Vieille Strasbourgeoise (The Old Strasbourg Woman).  Second version  A second and almost identical version of the painting, probably painted at the same time, was sold on 15 September 2020 at Christie's in Paris for 1.570.000 Euro, well above the estimated price. The canvas had belonged to Paul-Louis Weiller, who had bought it in London in 1967. The new private owner is said to be \\"from Asia\\".

Biography Sheea Herschorn was born in Krilovitz, Polodia to a distinguished rabbinic family, the son of Zissel (n√©e Weitman) and Rabbi Sender Herschorn. He received his main rabbinic training from his father, later studying at the University of Odessa and various yeshivot across Lithuania and Poland. Among his teachers were Rabbis Moshe Nathan Rubinstein (av beit din of Vinnitsa), Leib Braude (av beit din of Lemberg), and . He was ordained at the age of 19, and went on to serve on the rabbinical council of his hometown. Herschorn fled to Warsaw in 1919, amid the wave of anti-Jewish massacres that began in Ukraine after the First World War. He emigrated to Montreal, Canada in the summer of 1921, where he had relatives, and occupied the pulpit at Temple Solomon. From March 1926 he also served as rabbi of Congregation Beth David, and soon concurrently at Congregation Beth Yitzchak. Herschorn was a founding member of the Montreal Jewish Community Council (Va‚Äôad ha-‚ÄòIr), inaugurated in late 1922, and its Orthodox Rabbinical Council (Va‚Äôad ha-Rabbanim). A schism within the group led him, vice president Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg, and a group of sho·∏•tim to secede from the Council and form the United Synagogue in February 1923. The two organizations re-merged in December 1925, and Herschorn ultimately became the rabbinate's vice president in 1936. Herschorn was appointed president of the Rabbinical Council in 1951, succeeding Hirsch Cohen as Chief Rabbi of Montreal. In 1959, Herschorn published his most celebrated work, Mi-Ma‚Äôayanei Yeshua ( 'Wellsprings of Salvation'), a collection of responsa to Halakhic queries, prefaced by a haskama from the late Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski. He died on 15 May 1969 (28 Iyar 5729), and was buried in an ohel at the Kehal Israel Memorial Park in Dollard-des-Ormeaux. Personal life Sheea Herschorn married Molly (Malca) Surkes on 7 July 1922. They had one son, Michael Julius (Meshulam Jehuda), a Professor at McGill University's Department of Mathematics from 1958 until his retirement in 1998. Herschorn's father, sister Sarah, and her husband and son were murdered in the Holocaust in 1941.

The character is portrayed by actress Melissa Benoist, and has appeared in Glee since the premiere of the fourth season, \\"The New Rachel\\", first broadcast on September 13, 2012. Marley is a shy, unambitious wallflower who is the daughter of McKinley High's cafeteria lady, and aspires to be a singer on radio rather than be on Broadway. The character was created by Ryan Murphy as a means to create a character that had the talent of Rachel Berry but a different personality and aspirations. Benoist auditioned for the role and immediately got the part, after impressing Murphy. While Benoist was praised for her performance, the character has received mixed to positive reviews from critics and fans alike with some critics praising Marley for her original storyline contrasting sharply to that of Rachel Berry's while others found her storylines to be lackluster. Storylines=Season 4 Marley is introduced as the shy wallflower with a hidden passion for singing, the daughter of cafeteria lady Millie Rose. Following auditions for Glee club, she impresses Will Schuester, the seniors, and Unique with her rendition of \\"New York State of Mind\\" by Billy Joel (which Rachel Berry coincidentally happened to be singing for her NYADA audition). During her time at Glee club, Marley grows attracted to Jake Puckerman, the younger brother of Noah Puckerman and forms a close friendship with Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams. However, when Marley discovers that Jake is dating Kitty Wilde, a cheerleader that bullied her and said awful things about her mother's obesity, she is devastated. When Jake and Kitty break up, it is around the time that Finn announces a musical performance of Grease, which undergoes budget cuts leading to difficulties in funding. When auditioning, Marley meets Ryder Lynn, a football player and transfer student whom she grows briefly attracted to. Marley and Unique ignore Sue Sylvester deriding them, telling Unique he is not a girl, and the two impress Mercedes Jones, Finn Hudson, Artie Abrams, and Mike Chang with their rendition of \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\". Marley gets the role of Sandy and Unique gets Rizzo but is forced to surrender the part to Santana Lopez after Sue exploits bullying from his peers to his parents. During rehearsals, Kitty tries to undermine Marley's confidence by making her skip lunches and tampering with her costume to make her believe that she is getting fat like her mother. After the musical, which Rachel leaves New York to attend to show support for Finn, Marley develops bulimia and skips lunches after losing confidence in her body. During sectionals, in a rendition of \\"Gangnam Style\\", Marley passes out. When Santana blames Kitty for undermining Marley's confidence, the rest of the Glee club blames Marley for losing sectionals. However, when Sue disbands Glee club, she is the only one to stand beside Finn as he tries to keep the group together and finds them a place to practice. The group is reunited but they still haven't entirely forgiven Marley. However, they also acknowledge that Kitty is also at fault. On Christmas, Marley is depressed when they are unable to afford a Christmas tree because they need to pay her doctor. When Sue, who was assigned to be Millie's Secret Santa, overhears this, she feels bad for them and, with Becky Jackson, gives Marley a Christmas tree and $800 in cash to pay her doctor (a rare act of kindness shown by Sue). Marley thanks Sue by having the Glee club perform a rendition of \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" by Judy Garland. Come Valentine's Day, Jake expresses his love for Marley with help from Ryder (who also had feelings for Marley) via a rendition of You're All I Need to Get By by Marvin Gaye, leading to Marley being impressed. At the time of Mr. Schuester's wedding to Emma Pillsbury, following Emma running from the altar after kissing Finn Hudson, Ryder intimately expresses himself to Marley and kisses her, leading to a conflict with Jake when he finds out after Marley tells him. Following Finn confessing to Mr. Schue that he kissed Emma, the tension between the two becomes unbearable and leads to Finn resigning. Before he does, Marley goes to thank him and tells him that he is a good teacher and should get a teaching degree. This is what inspires Finn to go back to college. Marley starts to write original songs but no one seems to take notice. However, when Becky Jackson brings a gun to school and it accidentally fires, the students hide in fear of a school shooter. During this time, Kitty confesses that she sabotaged Marley's costume and apologizes for making her bulimic. After the school shooting, Sue takes responsibility to protect Becky and resigns as the coach of the Cheerios. Later, three of Marley's songs are performed, one of them at Regionals, \\"All or Nothing\\", to a standing ovation. Season 5 Marley is promoted to the main cast in this season. In this season, she gets into a skirmish with a Cheerio named Bree, who is tasked by Sue Sylvester, who has returned to McKinley High and demoted Principal Figgins to the role of janitor, to take down the Glee Club and promoted to Cheerio captain, despite having drenched Tina Cohen-Chang during her senior prom when she wins prom queen. This season, the first not to feature Finn Hudson following the passing of Cory Monteith, goes on to further explore how the Glee club is faring without him. It is tested in \\"A Katy or a Gaga\\" when Marley, who was supposed to dress in a seashell bikini, refuses and instead wears a Katy costume during a rendition of Lady Gaga's \\"Applause\\". This leads to a frustrated Will suspending her from Glee Club for a week. Jake comforts her by taking her back to his house to elope but when she refuses to go further because she is uncomfortable, this leads to an argument between the two where she lashes out at Jake for objectifying girls. Marley finds out that Jake had been cheating on her with Bree and as a result, she breaks up with him, despite his numerous apologies and attempts to win her back. She decides that they are better off as friends. She puts her love life to the side to focus on her songwriting career but is unsuccessful at getting anyone to accept her music, later revealing to Ryder her intentions to quit the New Directions. In order to change her mind, Ryder teams up with Jake Puckerman and give Marley's songs to Mercedes Jones, who comforts Marley and advises her never to give up on her dreams. Things take a turn for the worse when the New Directions loses Nationals, giving Sue Sylvester the excuse she needed to disband Glee Club. Even Holly Holliday and April Rhodes are unable to convince her to change her mind. Marley consoles her friends by telling her that Sue could never take away what they had, telling them that Glee Club brought them together, bidding them all farewell. Season 6 Marley is transferred to another school after the glee club is disbanded. She appears in Jagged Little Tapestry through the use of archival footage, seen sitting behind Blaine Anderson during a mashup of Will You Love Me Tomorrow and Head Over Feet. Her whereabouts during the season remain unknown. In The Hurt Locker, Part Two, she is mentioned by Rachel as \\"the one with the fat mom\\". Benoist did not return in the series finale \\"Dreams Come True\\", despite being invited, due to scheduling conflicts. Creation and Casting Melissa Benoist (pictured) was praised by Carl Cortez of Assignment X for \\"adding softness to a show wading in a sea of bitchiness\\". Marley first appears in the season premiere of the fourth season of Glee. Introduced as a wallflower who was also the daughter of the obese lunch lady, Millie Rose (played by Trisha Rae Stahl), Marley is written as a frequent target of bullying in regards to her mother being the cafeteria lady and overweight. Marley is played by actress Melissa Benoist. Growing up, Benoist, a native of Colorado, grew up as a fan of the series, revealing that she would watch it with a friend. She describes the cast members, including Kevin McHale and Heather Morris, as kind and extremely welcoming. In an interview with Sierra Tishgart of Teen Vogue, Benoist said of her casting: Although marketed as \\"the New Rachel\\", there has been a lot pointed out in how dissimilar the two characters are. Some fans have also expressed disappointment in Lea Michele and Melissa Benoist not sharing a scene together despite Marley's first song being a duet with Rachel Berry. In the show, Marley is not portrayed as ambitious as Rachel, instead having smaller interests and a completely opposite lifestyle. In an \\"I Heart Glee\\" interview, Benoist herself has stated that she does not think of Marley as a new Rachel, stating, \\"I would never even want to compare myself to Lea Michele, you know? She is amazing, like, on her own level, and so I always get, like, weird when people say that.\\" Benoist has also expressed a desire for young girls to be able to relate to Marley's struggles with issues like bullying and bulimia. While promoting the show, Benoist appeared on Anderson Live, where Anderson Cooper gifted her with a face mask to prevent her from getting slushied again. She also appeared in interviews alongside Jacob Artist and Kevin McHale . Outside the Denver Center for Performing Arts, Matthew Morrison, who plays Will Schuester on the series, revealed in an interview with John Moore that he and Benoist both shared stories of skiing when in Colorado and praised Benoist as an absolute delight to work with. Musical performances Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly gave the New York State of Mind duet an A-, writing \\"Sung in part by both Marley and Rachel, in an arrangement that was lovely for both voices, it was a great introduction for newcomer Marley, as well as a reminder after a summer apart that Berry has still got it.\\" Strecker also offered praise to Benoist's rendition of \\"Chasing Pavements\\" by Adele. Lauren Hoffman of Vulture also wrote positively, stating, \\"Marley goes riff for riff and punch for punch with Rachel. And the difference between watching Marley and Rachel perform is that when Marley sings it looks like fun, and when Rachel sings it looks like work.\\" The rendition of New York State of Mind by Michele and Benoist peaked at number 24 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Later performances by Marley received more critical responses. In The Role You Were Born to Play, the decision to use Blow Me (One Last Kiss) by P!nk was criticized by Karen Walsh of Entertainment Weekly as being a poor choice for an audition song but nevertheless, insisted that she \\"dug the harmonies on this, and the word changes.\\" Natalie Fisher of Hypable described Benoist's duet with Becca Tobin in a rendition of Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\" as having \\"more lesbian sexual tension than anything in the entire Brittana plot line. Kitty‚Äôs got a whip, Kitty‚Äôs wrapping Marley up in her whip, and Kitty‚Äôs using her whip as a rotating fan to create a wind machine effect on Marley‚Äôs hair.\\" Michael Slezak of TV Line praised Benoist's duet with Cory Monteith on Don't Dream It's Over which later developed into a group performance, writing, \\"What an absolutely gorgeous choice‚Ä¶someone ought to sagely scoop this one up on The Voice or The X Factor\\". Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly gave Benoist's duet with Heather Morris, a rendition of \\"Tell Him\\" by the Exciters, a B+, writing, \\"it wasn‚Äôt the strongest of the night, but it was a fun couple of minutes\\". She responded more positively to her duet with Alex Newell in a performance of \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" by Bruno Mars. Sandra Gonzalez gave Benoist's rendition of Superstition by Stevie Wonder alongside Amber Riley and Darren Criss an A-, writing, \\"Marley gets in touch with her inner diva, thanks to some help (and killer riffs) from Mercedes. Nicely done, ladies. Where were you when Marley was having her freak out in November, Mercedes?\\" Rae Votta of Billboard was critical of Benoist's rendition of Wrecking Ball in The End of Twerk, writing, \\"Jake‚Äôs cheating comes out this episode, and in response Marley performs the most demur version of ‚ÄúWrecking Ball‚Äù that you get why Miley Cyrus might have wanted to change her whole vibe. They try to recreate the video, but it comes off more like a college comedy troupe tried to spoof it, without the intentional humor.\\" Reception Critical reception towards Marley has been somewhat lukewarm. In a review for The New Rachel, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club expressed hope for the character, stating that she hoped \\"Benoist would be up for the challenge as Lea Michele was.\\" Carl Cortez of Assignment X praised Marley as adding \\"softness to a show wading in a sea of bitchiness\\". Fan reception to Marley was more polarized. A majority of fans who were in support of Rachel Berry took to express discomfort towards casting a replacement while some were disappointed that she was not living up to expectations. Others, however, reacted more positively to the fresh take on personality and offered praise to Benoist's performance.

She was a large cruiser submarine displacing 2,135 tons that entered service in 1926 and served in the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. During the latter conflict she operated in support of the attack on Pearl Harbor, conducted anti-shipping patrols in the Indian Ocean, supported the Indian Ocean raid, and took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign and the Guadalcanal campaign before she was sunk in December 1942. Construction and commissioning Built by Kawasaki at Kobe, Japan, I-3 was laid down on 1 November 1923 with the name SS-76. While she was on the building ways, she was renamed I-3 on 1 November 1924. She was launched on 8 June 1925 and was completed and commissioned on 30 November 1926. Service history=Early service Upon commissioning, I-3 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District, assigned to Submarine Division 7 in Submarine Squadron 2 in the 2nd Fleet. While in the Seto Inland Sea entering Moroshima Bay on the surface at on 12 July 1928, she suffered a rudder failure and ran aground off ≈åmishima Island at 10:11, damaging her bow fuel tank. She was refloated at 16:22 and proceeded to Kure to undergo repairs at Kure Navy Yard. The German naval attach√© to Japan, Kapit√§n zur See Paul Wenneker, was scheduled to inspect I-3 and her sister ship on 10 January 1935 while the two submarines were tied up at Yokosuka. Wenneker toured I-2 between 14:50 and 15:40, but his inspection of I-3 was cancelled due to bad weather. On 15 November 1935 I-3 was decommissioned and placed in reserve to undergo reconstruction. While she was out of commission her American-made sonar was replaced by a sonar system manufactured in Japan and her conning tower was streamlined. After the reconstruction was complete, she was recommissioned on 1 December 1936. During scheduled upkeep in Sukumo Bay on the coast of Shikoku on 18 May 1937, she suffered an explosion in a lubricating oil sump tank that killed one man and injured 17 others. She proceeded to Kure Navy Yard for repairs. Second Sino-Japanese War On 7 July 1937 the first day of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 28 July 1937, I-3‚Ä≤s division, Submarine Division 7, was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 in the 1st Fleet, and in September 1937 Submarine Squadron 1 was reassigned to the 3rd Fleet,Boyd and Yoshida, p. 54. which in turn was subordinated to the China Area Fleet for service in Chinese waters. The squadron, consisting of , I-2, I-3, , , and , deployed to a base at Hong Kong with the submarine tenders and in September 1937. From Hong Kong, the submarines began operations in support of a Japanese blockade of China and patrols of China‚Ä≤s central and southern coast. From 21 to 23 August 1937, all six submarines of Submarine Squadron 1 operated in the East China Sea as distant cover for an operation in which the battleships , , , and and the light cruiser ferried troops from Tadotsu, Japan, to Shanghai, China. Submarine Squadron 1 was based at Hong Kong until the autumn of 1938. In an effort to reduce international tensions over the conflict in China, Japan withdrew its submarines from Chinese waters in December 1938. World War II On 10 November 1941 ‚Äî by which time I-1, I-2, and I-3 made up Submarine Division 17 in Submarine Squadron 2 in the 6th Fleet ‚Äî the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu, gathered the commanding officers of the fleet‚Ä≤s submarines together for a meeting aboard his flagship, the light cruiser , which was anchored in Saeki Bay. Shimizu briefed them on the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, which would bring Japan and the United States into World War II. As the Imperial Japanese Navy began to deploy for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, I-3 got underway from Yokosuka at 12:00 on 16 November 1941, bound for the Hawaiian Islands. By 1 December 1941, she was within of Oahu. She received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. =First war patrol= On 7 December 1941, I-1, I-2, and I-3 arrived in their patrol areas in the Kauai Channel between Oahu and Kauai, with I-3 the easternmost of the three. They had orders to conduct reconnaissance in the area and attack any ships which sortied from Pearl Harbor during or after the attack, which occurred that morning. On 27 December 1941, I-3 received an order from the commander of Submarine Squadron 2 aboard the submarine to bombard the harbor at Nawiliwili, Kauai, on 30 December. She arrived off Nawiliwili during daylight hours on 30 December 1941 and conducted a periscope reconnaissance of the Wailua River estuary. After dark, she surfaced and fired twenty high-explosive rounds from her deck guns, targeting the harbor‚Ä≤s breakwater and a building she identified as a warehouse. Most of the rounds fell short, although one shell damaged a house with shrapnel and another punched a hole in a large gasoline storage tank, which did not explode. The bombardment inflicted damage totaling an estimated $500. On 31 December 1941, I-3 sighted what she identified as an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and several destroyers heading due west west-southwest of Oahu, but was unable to obtain a firing position on them. On 9 January 1942, she was ordered to divert from her patrol and search for the United States Navy aircraft carrier , which the submarine had sighted, but she did not find Lexington. She arrived at Kwajalein in company with I-1 and I-2 on 22 January 1942. The three submarines departed Kwajalein on 24 January 1942 bound for Yokosuka, which they reached on 1 February 1942. They underwent a complete overhaul and refit there. =Second war patrol= While I-3 was at Yokosuka, Submarine Squadron 2 ‚Äî consisting of I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-6, and I-7, the latter serving as squadron flagship ‚Äî was assigned to the Dutch East Indies Invasion Force. Accordingly, I-3 departed Yokosuka on 12 February 1942 with the commander of Submarine Division 7 embarked, bound for Palau, where she arrived on 16 February 1942 and refueled from the oiler , then got back underway on 17 February in company with I-2 bound for the Netherlands East Indies. The two submarines arrived at Staring Bay on the Southeast Peninsula of Celebes just southeast of Kendari on 22 February 1942, then put back to sea that same afternoon, heading for the Indian Ocean off the southwest coast of Australia, where I-3 was to conduct her second war patrol in the Cape Leeuwin‚ÄìShark Bay area. While en route, I-3 sighted an Allied submarine on the surface in the Banda Sea on 23 February 1942, but could not get into a firing position. On 2 March 1942, I-3 attacked the New Zealand 9,540-ton armed steamer on the surface in the Indian Ocean west-northwest of Fremantle, Australia. Although Narbada suffered minor damage from shell fragments, I-3 failed to score any hits on her, and when Narbada fired back, I-3 broke off her attack and submerged at . On 3 March 1942, I-3 encountered the New Zealand 8,719-ton armed steamer in the Indian Ocean west- northwest of Rottnest Island and pursued her on the surface, but when Tongariro ‚Äî which was nearing the end of a voyage from Wellington, New Zealand, to Fremantle ‚Äî opened fire, I-3 discontinued the chase and submerged. On 6 March 1942, while heading west-southwest on the surface, I-3 sighted the United States Navy submarine , also on the surface and on an intersecting course. Mistaking I-3 for the submarine , S-40 attempted to contact I-3, but I-3 opened fire on her with both deck guns at . S-40 submerged and attempted to gain a firing position on I-3 for a torpedo attack, but I-3 was too far away. I-3 concluded her patrol with her arrival at Penang in Japanese-occupied British Malaya on 14 March 1942. =Third war patrol= Orders arrived from the headquarters of the Combined Fleet on 15 March 1942 for all the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 except for I-1 to conduct reconnaissance operations along the coast of Ceylon and western coast of India in preparation for Operation C, the upcoming Indian Ocean raid by the aircraft carriers of the Combined Fleet‚Ä≤s Mobile Force. Accordingly, I-3 departed Penang at 28 March 1942 bound for the waters off Colombo, Ceylon. She sighted a land plane at 13:00 local time on 31 March 1942 at a distance of from Colombo and bearing 135 degrees from that port, but saw no other aircraft during her approach. She arrived in the Colombo area on 2 April 1942 and began to transmit weather reports for the benefit of the Japanese aircraft carrier force, and at 04:25 local time sighted a lone merchant ship steaming westward from, and bearing 220 degrees from, Colombo, but found no ships leaving or entering the harbor itself. At 22:00 she reported that she had been unable to penetrate the harbor itself due to heavy patrolling by Allied vessels. I-3 departed the Colombo area and was not in the vicinity when Mobile Force carrier aircraft struck Colombo on 5 April 1942. Early on the morning of 7 April 1942, she was in the Indian Ocean west-southwest of Colombo when she sighted five Allied merchant ships heading eastward and then a merchant ship and an oiler, both westbound. After an unsuccessful pursuit, she surfaced at and attacked the British 4,872-ton armed merchant steamer , which was on a voyage from Karachi to Colombo. From 02:40, she fired thirty-nine rounds and four torpedoes at Elmdale and scored 14 shell hits, but Elmdale survived the encounter. After 01:50 on 8 April 1942, I-3 surfaced west of Colombo and attacked the 5,051-ton armed merchant ship Fultala, which was on a voyage from Calcutta, India, to Karachi carrying 8,000 tons of coal. She hit Fultala with a Type 89 torpedo, and Fultala sank without loss of life at . Her entire crew was later rescued. I-3 returned to her patrol area southwest of Colombo on 9 April 1942, then proceeded to Singapore, where she arrived in company with I-7 on 15 April 1942. She got back underway on 21 April 1942 bound for Japan, and arrived at Yokosuka on 1 May 1942. =Fourth war patrol= While I-3 was at Yokosuka, the Aleutian Islands campaign began on 3‚Äì4 June 1942 with a Japanese air raid on Dutch Harbor, Alaska, followed quickly by the unopposed Japanese occupation in the Aleutian Islands of Attu on 5 June and Kiska on 7 June 1942. On 10 June 1842, I-1, I-2, and I-3 were reassigned to the Northern Force for duty in the Aleutians, and on 11 June 1942 I-3 set out for Aleutian waters in company with I-1, I-2, I-6, and I-7 to begin her fourth war patrol. On 20 June 1942, I-1, I-2, and I-3 joined the \\"K\\" patrol line in the North Pacific Ocean between and . She remained on the patrol line until 3 July 1942. On 20 July 1942, she was reassigned to the Advance Force and ordered to return to Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka on 1 August 1942 and underwent repairs there. =Guadalcanal campaign= During I-3‚Ä≤s stay at Yokosuka, the Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. Submarine Squadron 2 was disbanded on 20 August 1942 and I-3 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1 for operations around Guadalcanal. I-3 left Yokosuka on 8 September 1942 in company with I-1, I-3, I-4, and I-5, stopped at Truk from 15 to 17 September 1942, and proceeded to Shortland Island in the Shortland Islands. While she was at sea, she was reassigned along with I-1 and I-3 to the Outer South Seas Force in the 8th Fleet. On 26 September, I-3 reached Shortland Island, where the destroyers and had delivered four Daihatsu-class landing craft, each loaded with a Type 88 75-millimeter antiaircraft gun, an artillery tractor, and several Type 96 150-millimeter infantry mortars. The commanding officers of I-2 and I-3 took part in a staff conference to decide on a way of delivering the equipment to the Imperial Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal, and, after they made their plans, I-2 and I-3 departed on a supply run to Guadalcanal at 03:30 on 27 September 1942, each towing a Daihatsu. They returned to Shortland Island after delivering their cargoes. Between 3 and 5 October 1942, I-3 attempted three supply runs to Wickham Anchorage on Vangunu and Viru Harbor on New Georgia, but aborted each voyage. She was reassigned to \\"A\\" Patrol Group in the Advance Force on 10 October 1942, and while on patrol south-southeast of San Cristobal on 15 October 1942 transmitted a report at 22:40 that she had sighted several Allied cruisers. I-3 returned to Truk on 3 November 1942, and while there had her after gun replaced with a mounting abaft her conning tower for a waterproof Daihatsu that allowed her to discharge her cargo more quickly. While she was at Truk, the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu, addressed a meeting of the commanding officers of his fleet‚Ä≤s submarines on 16 November 1942 to inform them that the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, had ordered the 6th Fleet to organize a system of supply runs to the 17th Army forces fighting on Guadalcanal via submarine. Assigned to these supply missions, I-3 departed Truk on 19 November 1942 bound for Rabaul with a cargo of 20 tons of food and medicine. She stopped at Rabaul from 22 to 24 November 1942, then proceeded to Shortland Island, which she reached on 25 November 1942. Carrying a waterproof Daihatsu on her new mounting, she departed on 27 November and reached Kamimbo Bay on the northwest coast of Guadalcanal on 28 November 1942. She quickly unloaded the Daihatsu and got back underway for Shortland Island, which she reached on 30 November 1942. On 1 December 1942, she put back to sea on another supply run to Guadalcanal, but when she surfaced off Kamimbo Bay after sunset on 3 December 1942, two Allied motor torpedo boats sighted her and forced her submerge, and she returned to Shortland Island on 5 December 1942 without delivering her cargo. On 7 December 1942, she got underway from Shortland Island for her sixth supply run to Guadalcanal. =Loss= On 9 December 1942, I-3 surfaced at Kamimbo Bay, launched her Daihatsu, and began preparations to deliver her cargo. At 06:52, the PT boat PT-59, patrolling the area in company with PT-44, sighted I-3 on the surface with her Daihatsu alongside. At 07:03, PT-59 fired two Mark 15 torpedoes at I-3 at a range of Her second torpedo missed and passed under PT-44 without detonating, but her first torpedo struck I-3‚Ä≤s stern, resulting in a large explosion. I-3 quickly sank at . Four members of her crew were blown overboard, swam to Guadalcanal, and survived, but the other 90 members of I-3‚Ä≤s crew perished. Over the next 90 minutes, a large oil slick rose to the surface. The loss of I-3 led the Japanese to suspend submarine supply trips to Guadalcanal on 11 December 1942. I-2, which departed Shortland Island on 9 December 1942 on a supply run to Guadalcanal, aborted her voyage on 11 December and returned to Shortland. I-3 was stricken from the Navy list on 20 January 1943. References=FootnotesBibliography *Boyd, Carl, and Akihiko Yoshida. The Japanese Submarine Force and World War II.

History The market hall, built in 1704 In the 12th-century, the area now occupied by the square was known as Arkilltofts, possibly named after Arnketil, a leading figure in the city around the time of the Norman Conquest. It was a large open space, occupying the south-eastern corner of the former Roman fortress. By 1130, it was owned by the royal larderer. At this time, he held responsibility for the sale of meat in the city, and a market gradually developed in the area. Initially, the site occupied around 10,000 square yards, although this has been reduced over time, as buildings encroached on the space, forming a square. By about 1250, the square was named Thursday Market, suggesting that, at the time, it hosted a market just one day a week. By the 14th-century, it was known in particular as a place to buy meat, although in the following century, only traders from outside the city could sell in the square, with York-based merchants instead confined to the nearby Shambles. The square was also the main location for the sale of fabric, and at times, baked goods, wool, candles, and certain other foodstuffs were also sold in the market. By the 16th-century, markets were held on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and in 1593, a Friday market was added for linen and other cloths. In 1421, the widow of John Brathwayt, a former Mayor of York, donated 20 marks for the construction of a market cross, and a guard house was later built alongside it. In 1704, Elizabeth Smith, who leased the square, obtained permission to demolish the cross, and in its place she built a small market hall, with a statue of George II. In 1765, a school was established in the upper chamber of the market hall, but it moved elsewhere in 1786. In 1818, the location became known as \\"St Sampson's Square\\", after St Sampson, Church Street, which can be seen from the square. By the 1830s, the market had become overcrowded, and Parliament Street was constructed, linking the square with the city's other market, on Pavement, and a large market established along its length. The part of the market in St Sampson's Square continued to specialise in meat, until 1888, when it switched to selling fish. By 1852, there were seven inns around the square. In 1955, the market stalls were moved to what is now Shambles Market, and the square became a car park. It was pedestrianised in 1976, and is now a popular location for festivals and seasonal markets. Public toilets were a feature of the square for many years, but were closed in 2010 and demolished in 2019. Layout and architecture The square, from the east The square is largely surrounded by buildings, with roads leading from its four corners: Feasegate leading from the southern corner, Davygate from the western, Finkle Street from the northern, and both Silver Street and Church Street from the eastern. Parliament Street leads south-east, and its broad entrance occupies half of the south-eastern side of the square. In addition, two snickelways connect to the square: Nether Hornpot Lane from the northern corner, and Three Cranes Lane from the middle of the north-eastern side. The north-western side of the square is dominated by Brown's department store, which was built in 1905, replacing several timber-framed houses. Further along, numbers 5 and 6 date from the 18th-century, and number 7 from the 16th- century. On the north-east side, the Roman Bath pub is noted for the remains of a Roman bath in its cellar, operated as a tourist attraction. The 18th- century Three Cranes Inn is the other surviving pub on the square, while number 12 is also listed. On the south-east side, 13 and 14 St Sampson's Square, and 15 St Sampson's Square are listed. On the south-west side, numbers 1 and 2 are listed, as is Melrose House at number 3, all 18th-century buildings.

He was exiled from Aetolia on account of unintentional homicide; his victim was either his own brother Therimus or a certain Alcidocus, son of Scopius. In his wanderings, he met Temenus, son of Aristomachus, on a road. Temenus had been told by an oracle to look out for a man with three eyes, and Oxylus, having one eye himself and riding a horse or mule with two more, matched that description. Oxylus then, as the oracle had recommended, accompanied Temenus and his brother, Cresphontes, in their invasion of the Peloponnesus. For his aid, Oxylus received Elis, a fertile land, as his own; others say, though, that he had to win it. He had been wanting the land for himself for a while and, suspecting that the Dorians would not give it to him, led them through Arcadia and not Elis, so they would not be able to observe the goodliness of it. Nevertheless, he did have to fight over the land with the Dorian Dius. The latter proposed that each side chose a single soldier to represent his army. Degmenus, an archer, fought for Dius and Pyraechmes, a slinger, for Oxylus; the latter won, and Oxylus received Elis as his domain. In accordance with a prophecy of the oracle, he brought in Agorius, great-grandson of Orestes and thus a descendant of Pelops, as a co-founder. The land became prosperous under him. By Pieria, Oxylus had two sons: Aetolus (mythology), who died before his parents, and Laias, who inherited the kingdom after him.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.8.3Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 5.3.7 & 5.4.5 Notes References  * Athenaeus of Naucratis, The Deipnosophists or Banquet of the Learned.

He was a co‚Äìfounder of the United States' Dental Anthropology Association, and is named among the founders of medical anthropology. He died in 1991 because of an embolism that was developed after he underwent a gallbladder surgery. He was married to Vilma Rose Hunt. They had 4 children, and they also fostered a daughter. Family Hunt was born in 1922 to Edward Eyre Hunt (Sr.) and Virginia Lloyd Hunt. E. E. Hunt (Sr.) was an economist and a war correspondent, and V. L. Hunt was a goldsmith and painter. She had also worked as a teacher of the fine arts at the University of Virginia. He was married to Vilma Rose Hunt. In 1952, Vilma traveled to Boston to study dentistry. She met Ed Hunt at the Forsyth Dental Infirmary. They married in 1952, moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts, and had four children: Margaret, William, Louise, Catherine and Martine (a foster daughter). Margaret, later, became the chair of the women and gender studies department at Amherst College. Vilma and Ed Hunt retired in 1985. Education Ed Hunt completed his B.A. from the Harvard College in 1942. After that, Hunt served in the United States Air Force for nearly 4 years during the second world war. However, he resumed his studies at the university after the war. In 1951, he completed his Ph.D. from the Harvard University with Earnest Albert Hooton as his doctoral advisor. He was Hooton's last doctorate student. He was also well versed in the subjects of mathematics and statistics. Career After completing his Ph.D., Ed Hunt worked for nearly 14 years at the Harvard University's Department of Anthropology and Forsyth Dental Center, with a break of 1 year in which he served as a visiting scholar at the University of Melbourne. Later, he joined the Hunter College as a professor of anthropology for 3 years. From 1969 to his retirement in 1985, he served as a professor of anthropology and health education at the Pennsylvania State University. He co‚Äìfounded the Dental Anthropology Association (US) and promoted the bio‚Äìcultural perspective in the field of human biology. Research During his time at the Harvard University, Ed Hunt worked on a \\"research program on Yap\\" that was funded by the United States Navy, and developed a keen interest in the subject of human growth which was further amplified by his increased \\"interest in the direct measurement of body composition and his gradual abandonment of somatotyping\\". While retaining his core interest in the growth studies, he also focused on the studies of primate behavior, history of physical anthropology, medical anthropology, and the problems of sports medicine. Paul T. Baker notes that Hunt had the readiness to inquire into the new ideas regardless of their deviance from the conventional scientific beliefs. He had done a through research on Bigfoot's \\"possible existence\\" and concluded that there was not adequate proof for Bigfoot's existence. Hunt wanted the focal point of the whole field of biological anthropology to be \\"causes\\" instead of \\"descriptions\\". Baker writes, Reception Gary D. James of the Binghamton University and Paul T. Baker saw him as, probably, biological anthropology's last \\"renaissance scholar\\". William Pollitzer wrote, The anthropologists Marcha Flint and Leslie Sue Lieberman views him as \\"a pioneer in statistics applied to human biology and physical anthropology.\\" They also credit him as one of medical anthropology's originators, and specifically, of applied medical anthropology. Death Hunt had undergone a surgery of the gallbladder. However, after the surgery, an embolism occurred, resulting in his death in 1991. In his youth, he had also suffered from Hodgkin's disease, but that was completely cured.

A prospective member of the rival Bandidos Motorcycle Club was convicted of perpetrating the attack, which occurred during the Nordic Biker War (1994‚Äì97). Background The Hells Angels clubhouse on Titangade prior to the attack. A conflict between the Bandidos and Hells Angels, known as the Nordic Biker War, commenced in January 1994. After its beginning in southern Sweden, violence involving the rival clubs also took place in Norway and Finland, before eventually reaching Denmark on 26 December 1995, when two Hells Angels members were severely beaten by a group of Bandidos at a restaurant in Copenhagen. The Hells Angels retaliated by ambushing and shooting Bandidos members at Copenhagen Airport on 10 March 1996, killing Bandidos \\"Southside\\" chapter president Uffe Lindenskov Larsen and sparking the most violent phase of the biker war.Toprocker er d√∏d: Han sk√∏d rocker-krigen i gang Jesper Vestergaard Larsen, B.T.

Four hours later, a second missile hit the clubhouse of the Hells Angels-affiliated Avengers Motorcycle Club in Aalborg. Four gang members sleeping in the building were unhurt by the missile, which did not detonate.Copenhagen - A Hell's Angels club house burns after being hit by an anti-tank missile The Independent (18 April 1996) A series of tit-for-tat shootings, grenade attacks and car bombings were carried out in the following months. The fortified compound used as a clubhouse by the Copenhagen Hells Angels chapter, located at Titangade 2‚Äì4 in the Ydre N√∏rrebro area of the city, was first targeted on 21 July 1996, when a six kilogram remote- controlled bomb hidden in a sports bag was placed in front of the clubhouse. The bomb failed to explode when the radio-controlled trigger malfunctioned, potentially saving the lives of four Hells Angels members in the building as well as residents of the street. The device was later detonated by police.Rockere bag en stribe af bomber Jan S√∏gaard, B.T.

The Hells Angels refused, however.Curious neighbour is first civilian killed in feud by Scandinavian branches of two bikers gangs; Hells Angels party bombed The Herald (7 October 1996) Attack At the height of the biker war, the Copenhagen Hells Angels made the contentious decision to host their annual \\"Viking Party\\" at their clubhouse on Titangade in N√∏rrebro on 5 October 1996. The party was attended by approximately one-hundred-and-fifty people,Nordic biker gangs at war Tampa Bay Times (September 16, 2005) including Hells Angels from Denmark and Sweden,Two killed in rocket attack in escalating biker gang violence The Irish Times (7 October 1996) as well as local residents who were invited by the club via posters in an apparent attempt to mollify members of the public who were outraged by the spiraling motorcycle gang violence. In expectance of another attack, police officers patrolled the perimeter, and parking near the clubhouse walls was prohibited. At approximately 3:05 am on 6 October 1996, a shoulder-fired missile was fired at the clubhouse from the sloping roof of a building between seventy and 330 yards behind the compound. The missile exploded after penetrating the building's concrete walls, killing two people ‚Äì thirty-nine-year old prospective Hells Angels member Louis Linde Nielsen and Janne Krohn, a twenty-nine-year-old single mother from the local area with no links to the club ‚Äì and wounding nineteen others, including Hells Angels Denmark national president Christian Middelboe. All of the wounded were Danish, except for one Norwegian. Around half of the party's attendees were congregated around a bar at the time of the explosion. The injuries were caused by shrapnel or by the extreme heat generated by the grenade.The Angels get a rocket from Hell The Independent (7 October 1996) The Carl Gustaf M3 84 mm recoilless anti-tank rifle2 Die As Blast Rips Hells Angels Clubhouse In Copenhagen The Seattle Times (October 6, 1996) used in the attack was one of twelve stolen from a Swedish Army weapons depot in Malm√∂ during a burglary on 19 February 1994.

Justice Minister Bj√∏rn Westh, along with senior police officials, visited the scene of the attack. Reacting to the concern caused by the escalation in motorcycle gang violence, the Danish government introduced harsher anti-crime legislation, which resulted in increased powers for the police and longer prison sentences for many offences. A bill, known as the Rockerloven (\\"Rocker Act\\") by the media, was passed on 15 October 1996 to allow the police to evict biker gangs from their clubhouses.H√∏jesteret godkender Rockerloven Niels Rohleder, Dagbladet Information (17 August 1999) Litigation Suspicion fell on the Bandidos immediately after the attack, and police searched the residences of several Bandidos members in Copenhagen. Bandidos member Mickey Borgfjord Larsen was taken into custody on 24 October 1996 after his fingerprints were found on a submachine gun that was thrown away by the assailants in F√¶lledparken following the rocket attack. He was charged with the attack on the Hells Angels clubhouse as well as the attempted murder of senior Hells Angels member J√∏rn \\"J√∏nke\\" Nielsen, who was shot in his cell at Jyderup prison on 25 July 1996. Larsen was released after four months in custody due to a lack of evidence.Den dr√¶bte blev morder som 17-√•rig Jan S√∏gaard, B.T. (18 September 2003) Investigators believed from the beginning that the perpetrator likely had a military background and experience with anti-tank weaponry. A Bandidos member informed police that the likely culprit could be Niels Poulsen, a club prospect with anti-tank training in the military. Poulsen had travelled to France but was arrested upon his return to Denmark on 19 November 1996. Poulsen's DNA matched that of the blood residue found on a balaclava that was discovered in a basement stairwell near the crime scene, and it was also proved that a scar under Poulsen's eye was sustained while firing the weapon.Drabschef taler ud om 'Raketmorderen i Titangade': 'Det er noget af det mest barske, jeg har oplevet' Louise Petring, B.T.

Whiteboy Posse, are a Canadian white supremacist neo-Nazi organized crime group primarily active in Western Canada. Formation and history The White Boy Posse was founded in the year 2003 by Sean \\"Fat Mike\\" Jackson, a close associate of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. Members are known to come from impoverished backgrounds, experiencing violence and abuse on a regular basis. Racist attitudes tend to initially be learned at home and later manipulated by gang leaders. The gang first received media attention in Edmonton in 2004 after five White Boy Posse members were kidnapped and assaulted by rival gang the Crazy Dragon Killers. Since its initial formation, the gang has since spread and currently operating in Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Structure and organization The White Boy Posse is a criminal enterprise that conducts cross-border business with a broad spectrum of other gangs and organized crime groups.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/12-charged-after-year-long- gang-investigation-1.862822 The group is primarily active in Northern Alberta, but had reach as far as Yellowknife.

Fully initiated members, referred to as \\"fully- patched\\", sport tattoos of the gang. WPB members also tend to exhibit tattoos of typical Nazi symbolism clich√©s including swastikas, the reichsadler, and other related national socialist motifs reminiscent of the Third Reich. However, they appear to have no links to any of the country's white power skinhead gangs, despite their neo-Nazi ideologies. Nevertheless, the WBP is widely considered by law enforcement to be bent on white supremacism. Notable crimes=Death of Martin William Kent In 2007, White Boy Posse member Martin William Kent was run over and killed while trying to prevent fellow member William Roy King from stealing his car.

In response, high-ranking WBP member Joshua Petrin ordered that he was to be killed. Two White Boy Posse hitmen were then sent to meet with Gower where he would be lured to his death. Once Gower had shown up to what was supposed to be a drug exchange at a rural intersection north of Lloydminster, he was immediately gunned down.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/murder- of-drug-dealer-ordered-by-gang-leader-killer-says-1.3856423 The shooter, Kyle Darren Halbauer, was eventually arrested later in December of the same year. Law enforcement action=Operation Goliath Starting in late 2006, members of the Edmonton Police Service and the Organized Crime Unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conducted an undercover 15-month operation that targeted the White Boy Posse. Dubbed Project Goliath, this law enforcement sting resulted in the arrest of 14 members of the White Boy Posse. 28 firearms, $500,000 in cocaine, over $300,000 in cash, 3,000 ecstasy pills, and several stolen items were also seized by the RCMP.

He founded (CHA, or the Argentine Homosexual Community) in 1984. In the early 1990s, he set up (Gays DC, or Gays for Civil Rights) and organised the first Pride march in Buenos Aires. He died from an HIV-AIDS- related illness at the age of 38. In memorial, a national day of activism for sexual diversity was established. He was posthumously given the Felipa de Souza Award, and, in 2017, a station was renamed after him on the Buenos Aires Underground.  Early life  Carlos J√°uregui was born in La Plata on 22 September 1957. After attending university, he studied as a postgraduate in Paris and then lived in New York City. When he returned to Argentina in 1982, he was not yet an activist. The National Reorganization Process, the military dictatorship that had ruled Argentina since 1976, collapsed in 1983 and the following year J√°uregui founded (CHA, or the Argentine Homosexual Community).  Career  CHA became an important group campaigning for gay rights in Argentina and is internationally recognised as a force in creating the strong LGBT rights in Argentina. By the end of the 1990s it was giving legal assistance, remembering AIDS deaths and campaigning for HIV/AIDS awareness and against LGBT discrimination. J√°uregui published (Homosexuality and Argentina) in 1987. It recounted his experiences as an activist in Argentina and the foundation of CHA. J√°uregui with fellow activist alt=Two people hugging J√°uregui then set up (Gays DC, or Gays for Civil Rights) in 1991, which later became Gays and Lesbians for Civil Rights. Its most active years were 1993 until 1996, with the group focusing upon supporting victims of discrimination based on sexuality and sufferers of AIDS. J√°uregui became a media figure, performing stunts such as suing Antonio Quarracino (the Archbishop of Buenos Aires) for discrimination. Unlike other gay leaders at the time, he always insisted upon the four \\"legs\\" of the \\"table\\", namely gay, lesbian, transexual, and travesti, saying that if any leg was missing the whole table would collapse. In 1992, J√°uregui organised the , the first LGBT Pride march in Buenos Aires. The first march drew 300 people; by the late 2010s it was drawing over 100,000 people.  Death and legacy  Carlos J√°uregui died at the age of 38 as a result of an HIV-AIDS-related illness on 20 August 1996. His partner Pablo Azcona and his brother Roberto J√°uregui had each previously died from AIDS related illnesses, in 1988 and 1994 respectively. Soon after his death, the Buenos Aires City Legislature voted to add a clause that punishes acts of sexual discrimination to the city's constitution. A square was named after him in Buenos Aires, and an annual day of activism for sexual diversity () was launched. In 1998, he was posthumously given the Felipa de Souza Award. A Buenos Aires Underground station was named after him in 2017; Santa Fe ‚Äì Carlos J√°uregui station was opened by Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta, chief of local government, and featured rainbow-coloured steps and a large mural. The Independent claimed it was the first station in the world to be named after a LGBT activist. Mabel Bellucci wrote (Pride ‚Äì Carlos J√°uregui, a political biography), which was published in 2010.

Life Compas used to work as a caseworker for the Albert Kennedy Trust, where she worked with homeless young LGBT people. In 2019, she became homeless after falling out with her family, due to Compas's sexuality. She explained that her \\"sexuality wasn‚Äôt a secret but the difference was when I brought my girlfriend to my family home to stay over; they couldn‚Äôt ignore the fact that I‚Äôm gay\\". She then had to spend Christmas alone, without her family, and decided that she would use her experiences working in the charity and social work sector to create events which would support other Black queer youth who are estranged from their families. In December 2019, she started the \\"Queer Black Christmas\\" event in London to do so, using a Crowdfunder to raise money for it, raising just over ¬£7000. During the national lockdown in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020, she decided to start raising money to set up the \\"Exist Loudly Fund\\", with which she intended to \\"support the needs of young people in the queer black community\\", with projects such as \\"monthly workshops, mentoring projects and fun activities, ...

While still a child, on a trip to see the Great Wall of China, she decided that her interest was in the exploration of the Mongolian region. She was educated at Smith College, followed by Newnham College, Cambridge where she studied Chinese, and psychology. In 1927 she travelled to Urga (now Ulan Bator) and made later trips to Manchuria and studied nomadic Tungus. She was able to record shaman practices in the region, assisted by her first husband, Oscar Mamen. By 1934, Lindgren began to investigate reindeer nomadism in the Swedish Lapland. She would later publish several works on the Reindeer Tungus of Manchuria, which included her doctoral dissertation on the subject. Lindgren conducted research in Siberia and was the first person to collect materials on the Polish anthropologist Maria Czaplicka and her research on the region. She authored three articles on the cultural contact between Evenks and Russian Cossacks. Part of her work on the Evenks was a photograph she captured in 1931 of the disk-shaped device called indaan, which is believed to be a simple model of the world used by reindeer herders. It also included her account of the Three- River Delta (TRD) Russians, which she said experienced periods of cultural and economic domination in their area of inhabitancy. She continued to work in Cambridge University and worked as a lecturer in the faculty of archaeology and anthropology. Having identified with the British cause during the Second World War, she became a naturalized British citizen in 1940. After the war she married her second husband Mikel Utsi, a Saami reindeer breeder. They were involved in introducing reindeer into the Scottish Highlands around 1949.

History During the Roman era, Eboracum's south-western gate, the porta praetorian, lay where the square is now located. Until the mid-18th century, much of the space was occupied by the graveyard of St Helen's, Stonegate. The streets of Stonegate and Davygate ran either side of the graveyard, meeting Coney Street at a junction known as \\"Cuckold's Corner\\". In addition, a footpath ran across the graveyard, linking Davygate with the junction of Stonegate and Blake Street. In 1745, St Helen's was given a plot of land on Davygate for use as a new graveyard, and the old graveyard was paved over, to form St Helen's Square. In the early 20th- century, the square was enlarged to the south-east, giving it a more regular, rectangular, shape. The York Tavern, built on the square in 1770, became one of two main departure points for stagecoaches to London. By 1818, Terry's had set up its shop on the square, and it remained there, later also operating as a restaurant, until 1980. In winter, the square is now the location of a large Christmas tree, and the city's Christmas lights are turned on in a ceremony held in the square. The square is also a popular location for demonstrations and rallies. Layout and architecture The square, looking north-east The square is an important junction, with Coney Street leading from its southern corner, Lendal from the west, both Blake Street and Stonegate from the north, and Davygate from the east. The south-western side of the square is occupied by the Mansion House, and there is also access to the York Guildhall, which can be seen through a gateway. On the north-western side, both the former Yorkshire Insurance Company and York County Savings Bank buildings were constructed in the mid-19th century and are now listed, as its the former Terry's building at number 3. The 18th-century Number 7, on the north-eastern side, is also listed, with the remainder of this side occupied by St Helen's Church. Numbers 2-8, occupying the south-eastern side, were built in 1929 and is also listed. Part of the building is occupied by Betty's tea rooms.

Caroline would later go on to introduce numerous social measures for the employees of Carrow Works, between 1857 and her death in 1895.  Early Life  Caroline Colman, n√©e Cozens-Hardy, was born to William Hardy and Sarah Cozens of Letheringsett Hall on 9th May 1831. She was the eldest of the family's four sons and five daughters. Before her marriage, Caroline dedicated her time to largely helping within the home and the local village. She cleaned and cared for her siblings. Colman also helped her father write and by the age of 20 she had produced her own articles for two separate Wesleyan magazines. She also dedicated much time to leading Bible studies, exchanging books with local villagers and reading to inmates of the workhouse. This proved evident for her unmistakable passion of love and freedom; both religiously and politically.  Personal Life  Caroline Colman became engaged to Jeremiah James Colman on 30th January 1855 with the couple being married on 25th September 1856. The wedding celebrations concluded with a fireworks display for the villagers. Upon returning from their honeymoon, it was decided that the Colmans would take up residence in Carrow House, the same Norfolk village in which Jeremiah James Colman's work was based. The Colmans left the village, paying farewell to each house and resident, with Caroline also bidding farewell to the women of the workhouse she tended. Caroline would eventually go on to have a great influence upon the works of her husband.  Influence at Carrow = Carrow School  In October 1857, Colman opened up a school for the Children of the Carrow Works employees. The school was opened in the upper room on King Street and began with 22 children in 1857, growing to 324 by 1870. Colman oversaw the functioning of the school. In 1859, The Carrow Girls' School was described as 'a picturesque garden in which is a cottage and lofty tower'.  Carrow Works  The Colmans' married life concentrated largely around the operations of J. & J. Colman. The company's scattered locations between Stoke and Carrow influenced the first six years of their marriage, with Jeremiah James alternating between these locations. Despite her husband's absence, Caroline was greatly intrigued by the people employed at Carrow Works, which went on to employ over 2,000 of the City of Norwich's inhabitants by 1893. As she had done before in her home village, she routinely cared for aspects of the business that would benefit from a woman's instruction. This mainly included the School and Kitchen departments. In 1868, Caroline began a works' kitchen at Carrow, one of her greatest ventures during her life in Carrow. The works' kitchen provided hot meals to Carrow Works' employees at affordable prices; vegetable stew and a pint of coffee was available to purchase at just 4d. In the kitchens, Colman acted as 'lady superintendent' and particularised the opening of the kitchens at 5:45 am to provide for those employees who undertook long journeys to work. The development of these work kitchens came almost half a century before the introduction and normalization of work canteens. In 1864, a dispensary was founded on King Street as part of the Colman's group.  Carrow Girls' Home  Colman showed much concern over the loneliness of the single girls employed at Carrow and the 'moral danger surrounding them', leading her to establish a residential home to house the girls. A matron was employed to manage the home. Colman instructed that a calendar was to be published and issued to every worker at Christmas, containing religious passages for every day of the upcoming year. Just as she had cared for her neighbors in her home village, Colman directed the annual distribution of care packages for deprived families.  Death and legacy  Colman's health deteriorated in 1895, and she died on the evening of 5 July that same year, aged 64. Colman was buried in Rosary Cemetery, Norwich. Caroline and Jeremiah James had 6 children. As for her earlier achievements within the education sector, it was not until 1990 that Carrow Works school came under the management of the Education Department. Jeremiah James Colman's business was the first to employ an Industrial Nurse, Philippa Flowerday, in 1878. Flowerday was employed to assist the company's doctor in the dispensary as well as paying home visits to the sick. Flowerday's employment and influence on Carrow Works was likely influenced by Caroline.

Watson statue is a public monument located near the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, Georgia. Dedicated in 1932, the statue honors Georgian politician Thomas E. Watson, who served terms in the United States Congress as both a Representative and Senator in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Originally located on the steps of the capitol building, the statue was removed from this location in 2013 and relocated to a nearby plaza.  History  Thomas E. Watson was a Georgian politician. Born September 5, 1856, he initially rose to prominence as an advocate against lynching and a proponent for expanding suffrage to African Americans. Early in his political career, he served in the Georgia General Assembly and as a U.S. Representative from Georgia. In the 1908 United States presidential election, he ran as a candidate for the People's Party, by which time he had changed his positions and had become an ardent supporter of white supremacy and espoused anti- Semitic and anti-Catholic sentiment. His anti-Semitic writings contributed to public sentiment that lead to the lynching of Leo Frank in 1915. He was later elected to the United States Senate in 1920, but died shortly into his term on September 26, 1922. On August 21, 1925, the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the erection of a monument honoring Watson on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol. The monument was designed by Joseph Klein, an Atlanta-based sculptor, and dedicated on December 4, 1932. The statue was originally located on the steps on the west side of the building. In October 2013, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal issued a state executive order ordering the statue to be removed from its position and relocated to a plaza near the capitol. This move came during a major renovation project on the building's west steps, with the decision to permanently relocate the statue rather than temporarily removing it expected to save between $50,000 and $60,000. The statue was removed from the capitol steps on November 29. The move was supported by the Anti-Defamation League and civil rights leaders, while criticized by the Sons of Confederate Veterans as \\"an attempt to rewrite or cover up ‚Ä¶ history.\\" Former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes voiced his support for the removal, saying he wished he had done the same during his governorship, but that \\"I just never got around to it. I regret I didn't.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:1932 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1932 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in Atlanta Category:Monuments and memorials in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Outdoor sculptures in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Statues in Atlanta ","title":"Statue of Thomas E.

The original church structure was built in 1872 along the Tamontaka river. Two schools one exclusively for boys and another for girls were established. The former was managed by the Society of Jesus and the latter was run by the Beatas de la Compania de Jes√∫s (now the Religious of the Virgin Mary). The church was moved to its present site in 1879. The Jesuits of Zamboanga took over the establishment in 1899. In 1939, the church became part of the Cotabato mission of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The church building was destroyed in an earthquake on August 17, 1976, and was rebuilt after two years. The building sustained damage in a fire on May 11, 1994, and was repaired within a year.

He did art for several Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury games and took a bigger role in The King of Fighters XIV and Samurai Shodown. Biography=Early life and preferences Nobuyuki Kuroki originally wanted to become a manga artist but felt he was not suitable for the job after going to an art school. Kuroki was a fan of John Wayne, Dragonlance and The Lord of the Rings. He found the requirement list for SNK on the bulletin board at his school by chance. Upon seeing the company SNK, Kuroki was amazed by the fighting game Art of Fighting which he considered a masterpiece. This inspired him to work at SNK. Kuroki studied in the same art school as Yasuyuki Oda, Osaka Designers' College. His biggest impression from Art of Fighting was one of the main characters, Ryo Sakazaki. Kuroki's three favorite games include Fatal Fury: The King of Fighters, Diablo III and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He also took a liking to the characters Terry Bogard and B. Jennet. Career Kuroki joined SNK in 1993. His first job was developing Yuri Sakazaki and Geese Howard's stages from the sequel Art of Fighting 2. In regards to Geese's younger persona in contrast to his adult look from Fatal Fury, Kuroki was influenced by a original video animation that featured him in a similar form. As he was an assistant, Kuroki had a bigger role in Fatal Fury 3 where he designed the new characters, the Jin Brothers which gave him pressure. He also worked on Wolfgang Krauser in Real Bout Fatal Fury Special and Rick Strowd in Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers, as well as Ryo Sakazaki in Art of Fighting 3. The character of Rock Howard was created by Kuroki in 1998. Both he and Yasuyuki Oda wondered what type of hero would succeed Terry Bogard in Fatal Furys latest game, Garou: Mark of the Wolves. While they were not confident with Rock, they still decided to make him as the new protagonist. Kuroki considers Garou as one of SNK's best creations based on the appeal of the graphics despite being a Neo Geo game. While he kept working in other games as artist while supporting other staff member, for the 2019 Samurai Shodown game, he took a bigger role in The King of Fighters XIV. Kuroki said staff wanted to captivate new fans with Kyo Kusanagi's larger design. Despite this, they accepted that any redesign of Kyo would illicit a mixed reaction and hoped older players of the series would understand he is still the same character despite any cosmetic changes. He regarded The King of Fighters XIV as a success based on the number of players buying it. Kuroki debuted as game director in Samurai Shodown. Kuroki felt proud with developing this game and being able to port to other consoles, most notably the Switch. For this game, Kuroki took advantage for the Unreal Engine in order to create art worthy of their preferences. Kuroki aimed the fighting system to be faithful to their previous installments. He also felt that the game would be easy for newcomers in fighting games. Kuroki stated in February 2020 that he is personally interested in 'reviving' Garou: Mark of the Wolves, with Kuroki having already done Rock and B. Jenet's animations before the sequel was cancelled. Similarly, he is into the idea of rebooting Art of Fighting.

He served as governor of the Orientale Province in the Belgian Congo from 1926 to 1933. Early years (1889‚Äì1913) Alfred Jean Alphonse Moeller was born in Louvain, Belgium, on 9 December 1889. His great-grandfather was Norwegian. His grandfather Jean Moeller and his father Charles Moeller were both distinguished historians at the Catholic University of Louvain. His mother was C√©cile Monville. Moeller attended the University of Leuven and graduated with a doctorate in law in 1911. He registered at the Mechelen Bar as a trainee, but soon decided to pursue a colonial career and was accepted by the territorial administration. He married Ir√®ne Garsou. Belgian Congo administrator (1913‚Äì1933) Moeller arrived in the Congo on 12 April 1913, and was appointed adjoint sup√©rieur of the Kasa√Ø District. In 1914 he was appointed district commissioner in Sankuru. In 1917 he was district commissioner at Stanleyville under General Adolphe de Meulemeester, known as \\"King Adolphe\\". He was promoted to district commissioner 1st class on 1 January 1920. On 16 February 1923 he was promoted to commissioner general of Orientale Province. In 1924 he was charged with a mission to study Uganda before returning via Mombasa to Europe. Moeller succeeded Adolphe De Meulemeester as governor and deputy governor-general of Orientale Province, taking office on 9 October 1926. He was always passionately interest in African customs, and supported strengthening the indigenous political structures and customary courts. He considered that the decrees of 15 April 1926 on native jurisdictions, of 23 November 1931 on extra-customary centers and of 5 December 1933 on native constituencies would give legal force to these institutions, and did not see that in other provinces they would be used to destroy the traditional authorities and impose increasingly direct and centralized control. Without asking permission from his superiors, he created \\"waiting sectors\\" in which the new ideas could be tried out. He continued the policies of his predecessor in expanding the road network and developing cotton cultivation. Moeller held office until 8 April 1933, when the provinces were reorganized and the era of the \\"great\\" provincial governors was over. He was replaced by Rodolphe Dufour as commissioner of Stanleyville Province (later renamed Orientale) and Georges Mortehan as commissioner of Costermansville Province (later Kivu). Later career (1933‚Äì1971) A pensioner at the age of 49, Moeller had too much energy and too many ideas to remain inactive. Colonial institutions From 5 February 1930 Moeller was a corresponding member of the Belgian Colonial Institute, now the Royal Academy of Overseas Sciences. He became a full member in 1939 and chairman in 1950. After returning to Belgium in 1933 he became professor at the Colonial University of Antwerp, later at the University Institute of Overseas Territories until 1950. He was a member of the Colonial Council from 1934 to 1938. In 1938 he became secretary general of the Kivu National Committee, holding his position until 1945. In 1939 he was rapporteur at the congress of the International Colonial Institute and vice-president of the International Institute of Differing Civilizations (Incidi) From 1945 to 1949, he chaired the Colonial Economic and Social Fund. From 1945 to 1947 and in 1952‚Äì53 he was president of the Royal African Circle. In 1954 he was president of the Royal Colonial Union and from 1962 to 1965 of the Royal Belgian Union for the Congo and the Overseas Territories. In 1957 he was president of the Board of Directors of the Royal African Institute in London. Commercial interests In 1938 Moeller returned to the Congo to chair the first International Congress of African Tourism in Costermansville (Bukavu). In 1940 he was president of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda Urundi Tourist Office. He sat on the boards of directors of the (CCCI), Compagnie Cotonni√®re Congolaise (Cotonco), (CFL), Auxiliaire Industrielle et Financi√®re des Grands Lacs Africains (Auxilacs) and the gold mines of Kilo-Moto, Soci√©t√© Immobili√®re au Kivu (SIMAK), among others. He was a vice-president of Sabena. Due to the links he forged during the war with Firmin van Bree, in 1945 he was put in charge of diamond sales of Formini√®re. He organized and represented this sector for 17 years in Great Britain, South Africa and the United States. Other activities During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the Germans invaded Belgium in 1940. Moeller moved in turn to Bordeaux, Lisbon and then London. The Minister of the Colonies entrusted him with missions in the Congo where he stayed from 1941 to 1943. He returned to London and became an adviser to the government in exile on 1 July 1943. He was a member of the government's advisory board in 1943‚Äì44. In 1944‚Äì45, after the liberation of Belgian territory but before the end of the war, he was involved in efforts to assist colonists exhausted by the war effort. He made various visits to the Belgian Congo in 1948, 1950, 1952 and 1956, and in 1957 visited the newly independent Ghana. In 1967 Moeller was forced to retire due to health problems.

Early life Reynolds was born in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire on 12 January 1918. She was the daughter of the portrait photographer Thomas Dent and his wife, Florence Nightingale, Haskett. Reynolds was first educated at Wentworth School, Huddersfield. She went on to study at the Huddersfield College of Art from 1934 to 1937, and by that time, the Great Depression undermined her father's photography business, causing her to join the Professional Photographers' Association. Reynolds joined the local ARP unit when the Second World War broke out, and was transferred to become a teleprinter operator at the headquarters of the Civil Defence Service in London in 1941. Career Her career as a full-time painter began in around 1950, contributing to mixed exhibitions in London and Paris. Reynolds' earliest works were out of watercolours, that were \\"somewhat in the style of neo-romantic landscapes of the 1940s\\". The subjects that featured in her earliest paintings such as landscapes and studies of animals and plants became a familiar feature in her later work. Reynolds began to experiment with abstract forms of expression from 1957 when American Abstract Expressionism became dominant in both Europe and the United States. She also made large oil paintings, one of which The Watcher was selected by Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister, for decoration in his study in 10 Downing Street. In 1964, she began to become a regular visitor to Suffolk. Reynolds requested that Georgia O'Keeffe take part in an exhibition sponsored by the Women's International Art Club in London in 1966. In 1968, Reynolds grew bored while on a trip to Connecticut and hired a car to wander across the United States. She developed a like of desert scenery while producing sketches in Arizona and New Mexico and made a series of small Indian ink and gouache pictures to capture Reynolds' reaction to South America's arid landscapes and sunsets. In 1973, Reynolds went to Australia, Iran, New Zealand and Thailand, producing more sketches. By that time, she began a career in printmaking while in middle-age, studying under Anthony Gross at the Slade School of Fine Art. She admired Gross' engraving and painting and collected his works and found inspiration from John Atkinson Grimshaw, Caspar David Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner, Bill Brandt's black-and-white abstract photographs and Hamaguchi's large mezzotints. Reynolds was encouraged by Gross to take up mezzotint, and was included in The Mezzotint Rediscovered exhibition of P. & D. Colnaghi & Co. in 1974, and wrote essays about mezzotint. She used daily use objects such as kettles, irons and tin openers in her printmaking. She was featured in the 1982 exhibition 80 Prints by Modern Masters at Angela Flowers Gallery and contributed to the publication of A Tribute to Birgit Ski√∂ld in the following year. Reynolds won the Barcham Green Award at the 1985‚Äì86 Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. She went on a trip to Japan in the 1980s and grew more interested in mezzotint, leading her to include Mount Fuji and Shinto shines in her small black-and-white works. Reynolds frequently contributed to the Small is Beautiful series of galleries at Flowers East Gallery. Her work was included in the 1991 exhibition A Survey of Influential East Anglian Artists at the Chappel Galleries, Essex and continued to exhibit in the gallery. Reynolds was chair of the Women's International Art Club from 1964 to 1967, served as the first chair of the Gainsborough's House Print Workshop, Sudbury, Suffolk between 1978 and 1979, and was fellow of the Printmakers Council. Personal life She was married to the art historian and museum curator Graham Reynolds from 6 February 1943 until her death from heart failure at their home in Bradfield St George, Suffolk on 12 December 2002. They did not have any children. Legacy Michael Kauffman called Reynolds \\"a Yorkshire woman of great human warmth, and neither her jollity nor her outspokenness were affected by years of living in the south.\\" Her pictures are held in galleries such as Arts Council England, the British Museum, the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Reynolds' husband wrote Daphne Reynolds: A Memoir in 2007 and sold copies of the book for close friends of the couple.
