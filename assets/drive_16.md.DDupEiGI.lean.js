As a young man, Stefan Szczotkowski supported the cause of the January Uprising, for which the Szczotkowski family was punished with the loss of their property, and Stefan himself was forced to migrate into far East of Russia.After three years, he was allowed to travel to Congress Poland; the central national archives of Chuvashia (–¶–ì–ê –ß–†.) in Cheboksary contain records of Stefan's compulsory stay in Tsivilsk (–¶–ì–ê –ß–†. –§.122. –û–ø.1.–î.7. –õ.58; –¶–ì–ê –ß–†. –§.122. –û–ø.1.–î.9.–õ.132; –¶–ì–ê –ß–†. –§.122. –û–ø.1.–î.28. –õ.60; –¶–ì–ê –ß–†. –§.122. –û–ø.1.–î.2–±. –õ.46) He arrived in Warsaw in 1867 and got married there. Soon after, he became ill with tuberculosis and died when his son was two years old. Zygmunt's mother moved to her family in W≈Çoc≈Çawek where young Zygmunt started his education. Later in his life his mother decided to move back to Warsaw where 18-year-old Zygmunt finished gymnasium. After finishing the secondary school he began studying in University of Leoben's mining faculty (Austria). He graduated it in 1900. After graduating he decided to take part in an expedition to the Ural Mountains but quickly changed his mind and decided to stay in Poland. Professional career Zygmunt Szczotkowski with his wife, 1936 In January 1901 he passed an examination before the Mining Board and in 1901-1906 he worked as a supervising engineer in one of the shafts of the Niwka coal mine near Sosnowiec. From July 1906 he supervised a coal mine Saturn in Czelad≈∫. In 1913 he resigned his position and traveled to France and Belgium to learn the latest technologies in mine rescue. He planned to build a mine rescue station in Sosnowiec. He returned to Warsaw in 1914 where he became the manager of Biuro Stacyjne Sekcji Opa≈Çowej (Station Bureau, Fuel Section) until 1919. While in Warsaw he passed the examination for a public servant. In 1919 he directed mining operations near Zawiercie. On March 1, 1920 he became the chief engineer of Compagnie Galicienne de Mines in LibiƒÖ≈º and on December 18 he was also nominated as the Polish president of the one of mines of the company ‚Äì Janina Coal Mine. In the interwar period he took active part in the development of the Central Industrial Region;He was the co-author, together with Micha≈Ç Dunajecki, the then manager of Siersza Coal Mine and Ludwik Oelwein, the then manager of the Jaworzno-Bory Coal Mine, of a memorial, delivered to Minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski in 1927, titled \\"Sprawa Kopal≈Ñ Zag≈Çƒôbia Krakowskiego\\" (The Case of the Cracow Coalfield) in which the authors emphasized the dire need of providing support to support the growth of the five mines in the Cracow Coalfield area, especially in the face of the potentially coming dangers to the stability of Polish coal mining industry in Silesia. he also cooperated closely with the former Leopold Skulski government minister for industry and trade (1919-1920), Antoni Olszewski (in 1935-1937 he was a member of Olszewski's Committee for the Investigation of National Enterprises, the so-called Statism Committee) and with a former Minister of Transport in the governments of Kazimierz Bartel and J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, later to become the manager of the Trzebinia Coal Mine, Pawe≈Ç Romocki. For his merits for the Polish industry, on November 11, 1937, Szczotkowski was awarded the Knight's Cross of Order of Polonia Restituta.Monitor Polski 1937 nr 260 poz. 410, p. 3, col. 1 After the break out of World War II, from September 18, 1939 until June 3, 1940 he continued working in the mine and he was employed by the Germans as an acting manager (Treuh√§nder). Around that time he was arrested by the Gestapo and accused of sabotage, he was released without any charges and continued to work in the mine. In summer or autumn of 1940 he left LibiƒÖ≈º and joined his family who since September 1, 1939 was living in Bie≈ºan√≥w.

History Giovannoni and Ciacci formed Karmamoi in 2008. Shortly after, they worked with guitarists Fabio Tempesta and Alex Massari and bassist Alessandro Cefal√¨, who completed the line-up. In 2009 Karmamoi met Crisalide Edizioni, who believed in the project and together with the band began to work towards the release that summer of a single, \\"Venere\\", which generated positive responses from radio stations and the public. \\"Venere\\" was broadcast by many independent stations even beyond the Alps, which led the band to take part in the JIMI Festival de Marne in Paris. That same year, as well as a series of concerts in the bigger live venues of Rome, Karmamoi played in the M.e.i. festival in Faenza. In May 2010 Karmamoi featured on the soundtrack of the short film by Paolo Budassi Cinque Note and began recording the tracks for their debut album. In January 2011 they released the self- titled Karmamoi. The album was accompanied by the video of \\"Vivo Desiderio\\", directed by Paolo Budassi. In January 2011 the band performed in the Eurosonic showcase festival in Groningen and launched the album at Rising Love in Rome. They performed at the Rome Fnac, and gave interviews and radio broadcasts. In September 2011 the band appeared in the Supersonic Festival and Naples's AWOP Festival. Entre Chien Et Loup In 2012, the band released an EP entitled Entre Chien Et Loup, which launched at the Teatro Elsa Morante in Rome on 17 May 2012. Entre Chien Et Loup connects the pop proclivities of the debut album and their later rock/prog direction. The EP includes the new single \\"Stesa\\", which epitomizes the musical changes underway. Odd Trip In late 2013, Karmamoi released Odd Trip, featuring a single of the same name. Ciacci left the band to work on other projects. Silence Between Sounds Silence Between Sounds is their third album. Due to personnel changes, the album took over two years to complete. Karmamoi used this opportunity to follow a new musical path. They decided to keep the band without an official vocalist, and for this reason Silence Between Sounds features multiple singers, each of whom brought their own voice to the music. They featured instruments such as the cello, piano, flute and clarinet. This change allowed them to balance traditional and modern progressive rock. Thematically, the piece attempts to understand the reasons for human failure. Producer and engineer Mark Tucker (Jethro Tull) worked closely with Daniele as co-producer and mixing engineer. The Day Is Done In 2018, Karmamoi's fourth studio album, The Day Is Done, was released. The album is a concept album, describing two brothers trying to find a better life in Europe who ultimately die in the Grenfell Tower fire. For The Day Is Done the band involved guests such as Colin Edwin, the bassist of (Porcupine Tree and O.R.K.) and Geoff Leigh, flutist and saxophonist (Steven Wilson, Ex-Wise Heads, Henry Cow and many others). Mark Tucker co-produced and sound engineered the album. The album was recorded at ARC at Abbey Road Studios, UK.

Though there may be a wide variety of interactions between networks, dependency focuses on the scenario in which the nodes in one network require support from nodes in another network. For an example of infrastructure dependency see Fig. 1.  Motivation for the model  In nature, networks rarely appear in isolation. They are typically elements in larger systems and can have non-trivial effects on one another. For example, infrastructure networks exhibit interdependency to a large degree. The power stations which form the nodes of the power grid require fuel delivered via a network of roads or pipes and are also controlled via the nodes of communications network. Though the transportation network does not depend on the power network to function, the communications network does. Thus the deactivation of a critical number of nodes in either the power network or the communication network can lead to a series of cascading failures across the system with potentially catastrophic repercussions. If the two networks were treated in isolation, this important feedback effect would not be seen and predictions of network robustness would be greatly overestimated.  Dependency links  Links in a standard network represent connectivity, providing information about how one node can be reached from another. Dependency links represent a need for support from one node to another. This relationship is often, though not necessarily, mutual and thus the links can be directed or undirected. Crucially, a node loses its ability to function as soon as the node it is dependent on ceases to function while it may not be so severely effected by losing a node it is connected to. In percolation theory, a node is considered active as long as it is connected to the giant component. The introduction of dependency links adds another condition: that the node that it depends on is also active. Dependency can be defined between different networks and also within the same network. For a recent book and a review on networks of networks called also multilayer networks see Bianconi and Boccaletti et al. For a recent book and a review on networks of networks called also multilayer networks see Bianconi and Boccaletti et al.  Percolation properties and phase transitions  Interdependent networks have markedly different percolation properties than single-networks. If a single network is subjected to random attack 1-p, the largest connected component decreases continuously with a divergence of its derivative \\\\frac{dP^{\\\\infty}}{dp} at the percolation threshold p_c, a second-order phase transition. This result is established for ER networks, lattices and other standard topologies. However, when multiple networks are interdependent, cascading failures emerge due to the positive feedback caused by dependency links. This family of processes causes a discontinuous or first order phase transition. This has been observed for random networks as well as lattices. Furthermore, for embedded interdependent networks the transition is particularly precipitous without even a critical exponent for p>p_c. Surprisingly, it has been shown that‚Äîcontrary to the results for single networks‚Äîinterdependent random networks with broader degree distributions are more vulnerable than those with narrow degree distributions. The high degree which is an asset in single networks can be a liability in interdependent networks. This is because the hubs which increase the robustness in single networks can be dependent on vulnerable low-degree nodes. The removal of the low-degree node then removes the hub and all of its links.  Dynamics of cascading failure  A typical cascading failure in a system of interdependent networks can be described as follows: We take two networks A and B with N nodes and a given topology . Each node A_i in A relies on a critical resource provided by a node B_i in B and vice versa. If A_i stops functioning, B_i will also stop functioning and vice versa. The failure is triggered by the removal of a fraction 1-p of nodes from A along with the links in A which were attached to each of those nodes. Since every node in B depends on a node in A, this causes the removal of the same fraction 1-p of nodes in B. In network theory, we assume that only nodes which are a part of the largest connected component can continue to function. Since the arrangement of links in A and B are different, they fragment into different sets of connected components. The smaller components in A cease to function and when they do, they cause the same number of nodes (but in different locations) in B to cease to function as well. This process continues iteratively between the two networks until no more nodes are removed. This process leads to a percolation phase transition at a value p_c which is substantially larger than the value obtained for a single network.  Effect of network topology  In interdependent random networks in which a fraction q of the nodes in one network are dependent on another, it is found that there is a critical value q_c above which first-order phase transitions are possible. In spatially embedded interdependent networks, a new kind of failure has been observed in which a relatively small failure can propagate through space and destroy an entire system of networks.  Localized attacks  Fig. 2 Demonstration of a spatially embedded multiplex network after localized attack of radius rh. The nodes are regular locations in two-dimensional lattice while the links in each layer (purple and orange) have lengths that are exponentially distributed with characteristic length zeta = 3 units and are connected at random. A new percolation process, localized attack was introduced by Berezin. Localized attack is defined by removing a node, its neighbors and next nearest neighbors until a fraction of 1-p is removed. The critical p_c (where the system collapse) for random networks was studied by Shao. Surprisingly, for spatial interdependent networks there are cases in which a finite number (independent on the size of the system) of nodes causes cascading failures through the whole system and the system collapses. For this case p_c=1. Spreading of localized attacks on multiplex networks have been studied by Vaknin et al. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC BY 3.0) license For demonstration of spatial multiplex of two networks see Fig. 2. Recovery of nodes and links The concept of recovery of elements in a network and its relation to percolation theory was introduced by Majdandzic. In percolation it is usually assumed that nodes (or links) fail but in real life (e.g., infrastructure) nodes can also recover. Majdandzic et al. introduced a percolation model with both failures and recovery and found new phenomena such as hysteresis and spontaneous recovery of systems. Later the concept of recovery was introduced to interdependent networks. This study, besides finding rich and novel critical features, also developed a strategy to optimally repair a system of systems.  Comparison to many-particle systems in physics  In statistical physics, phase transitions can only appear in many particle systems. Though phase transitions are well known in network science, in single networks they are second order only. With the introduction of internetwork dependency, first order transitions emerge. This is a new phenomenon and one with profound implications for systems engineering. Where system dissolution takes place after steady (if steep) degradation for second order transitions, the existence of a first order transition implies that the system can go from a relatively healthy state to complete collapse with no advanced warning.  Reinforced nodes  In interdependent networks, it is usually assumed, based on percolation theory, that nodes become nonfunctional if they lose connection to the network giant component. However, in reality, some nodes, equipped with alternative resources, together with their connected neighbors can still be functioning after being disconnected from the giant component. Yuan et al. generalized percolation model that introduces a fraction of reinforced nodes in the interdependent networks that can function and support their neighborhood. The critical fraction of reinforced nodes needed to avoid catastrophic failures have been found. Interdependence dynamics The original model of interdependent networks regarded only structural dependencies, i.e., if a node in network A depends on a node in network B and this node in network B fails also the node in A fails. This led to cascading failures and abrupt transitions. Danziger et al. studied the case where a node in one depends on the dynamic on the other network. For this, Danziger et al. developed a dynamic dependency framework capturing interdependent between dynamic systems. They study synchronization and spreading processes in multilayer networks. Coupled collective phenomena, including multi-stability, hysteresis, regions of coexistence, and macroscopic chaos have been found.  Examples  * Infrastructure networks. The network of power stations depends on instructions from the communications network which require power themselves. * Transportation networks. The networks of airports and seaports are interdependent in that in a given city, the ability of that city's airport to function is dependent upon resources obtained from the seaport or vice versa. * Physiological networks. The nervous and cardiovascular system are each composed of many connected parts which can be represented as a network. In order to function, they require connectivity within their own network as well as resources available only from the other network. * Economic/financial networks. Availability of credit from the banking network and economic production by the network of commercial firms are interdependent. In October 2012, a bipartite network model of banks and bank assets was used to examine failure propagation in the economy at large. * Protein networks. A biological process regulated by a number of proteins is often represented as a network. Since the same proteins participate in different processes, the networks are interdependent. * Ecological networks. Food webs constructed from species which depend on one another are interdependent when the same species participates in different webs. * Climate networks. Spatial measurements of different climatological variables define a network. The networks defined by different sets of variables are interdependent.

The mill is the best preserved 19th century flour mill in Victoria and a remarkably intact heritage site. Days Mill Homestead, Murchison South Location The mill and farm were part of an original property near the Goulburn River on Days Road, Murchison South, approximately north of Melbourne. The historic property comprises with the surrounding farm land having been sold off privately. History In 1865 William Day selected about in the Parish of Murchison. He was astute enough to notice that this recent Land Act had greatly increased farming activity in and built a two story flour mill. He also operated a bush sawmill and a punt over the Goulburn River and his wife Ann ran a local store.Day's Mill and Farm summer school report / prepared by Gary Vines. Dept. of Conservation and Environment, 1990 William Day did not live to see the great migration of settlers into the Goulburn Valley. In August 1870, while trying to tame a young cow, William was thrown against a fence and suffered severe injuries to his legs and arms. He probably did not recover from this accident and died in 1872. Anne was left to support seven children, aged 5 to 19. She was not left without means, as William's estate was worth over ¬£5,000. From 1872 until 1891 the farm and mill were run very capably by Anne Day, and during these years the farm was one of the more advanced properties in the district. A valuable collection of letters detailing the running of the farm during this period, reveal a picture of a strong woman astutely conducting business in the male dominated Victorian business world. Her letters detail her battles with impecunious selectors; her attempts to place flour in the Melbourne market; her battles with tardy agricultural machinery makers; and most importantly, her struggle to sell her farm produce at a good price in the Melbourne market.Two model farmers: Ann and Joseph Day of Murchison. Victorian Historical Journal (1987), v.71, no.2, Sept 2000, p.102-123 ()Charles Fahey Published Sept 2000 Stone milling had proven unsuitable for the hard grains of Australia, as well as in the United States and the new European wheat frontier of Hungary, where millers and millwrights experimented with flour milling technology, and in the 1870s the new technology of iron roller mills was developed. Days Mill was not an economic proposition by the 1880s, when railway transport allowed competition from surrounding mills and Melbourne mills, and roller technology displaced the old stone mills. The Day family did not make the transition to the expensive new roller mills developed in the 1870s and they simply stopped milling flour in the late 1880s. Anne Day retired from farming and storekeeping and the estate of her late husband was settled in 1891 and the eldest son, Joseph, took over the mill on Ann‚Äôs retirement and from then on the property operated simply as a farm, and the property was run only for farming, although Joseph occasionally ground chicken feed for his neighbours. in 1910 Joseph Day extended the size of his farm and acquired a further 320 acres. A third son, Henry, acquired 244 acres.Fahey 2000, citing farm management records 1891 to 1917 found in the mill Today the site retains an almost intact nineteenth century assemblage of farming and flour milling equipment. Approached along a peppercorn and pine tree lined drive with a gatehouse at the entrance, the three-storey brick mill of 1865 and later granary extension is flanked by a two-storey brick residence with a two-storey encircling verandah that was added around 1905. The mill was driven by a rare early E T Bellhouse steam engine, which was powered by a Cornish boiler both of which intact. Other buildings on site include a large stable, chaff shed, blacksmith, butchery, dairy, shearing shed, miking shed, piggery and chook shed, constructed variously in hand made brick, timber and corrugated galvanised iron. All the original mill machinery and equipment remains including three under driven mill stones, grain and meal elevators, a bolting reel, air leg aspirator, sack hoist and ancillary equipment. Preservation The historic mill has been known to historians for many decades, and was first photographed as an historic site in about 1966.JT Collins Photo 1966 The Victorian government, through the Historic Buildings Council and National Estate Grants Program, purchased the property in 1985.

Its ruins are located east of the modern town √áaƒülarca in the Konyaaltƒ± district of Antalya Province, Turkey. The site lies 22 kilometers to the west of Antalya. History The city isn't mentioned by any ancient author and its name is only known through coins and inscriptions. The name is mentioned for the first time in history on the Stadiasmus Patarensis, a Roman milestone excavated at Patara. The inscription on the milestone was made during the reign of Claudius and is dated to 45/46 AD. There is no evidence for the existence of the city during the Hellenistic period. Under Roman rule the city was part of the Lycian League. The only coins excavated at the site bear the image of Gordian III, who granted the city the right to mint coins. An inscription dated to 278/279 AD states that the city was designated as a Roman colony during the rule of Terentius Marcianus, the governor of the Roman province of Lycia- Pamphylia at that time. Under the Byzantine Empire the city became part of Pamphylia. Excavation history Trebenna was discovered by Karol Lanckoro≈Ñski. In 1882 he joined a scientific expedition to Lycia with the goal of describing many sites which were either completely unknown or poorly researched at the time. He provided a brief description of the city in a publication of the expedition's discoveries in 1892. Layout The ruins of the city lie on a small hill and are surrounded by an early Byzantine wall. Within the walled area many inscriptions and sarcophagi were found. It contains the ruins of Roman baths and an early Byzantine basilica. The Roman baths are notable for their relatively large size and high quality in a smaller city as Trebenna. With a size of 302 square meters (423 square meters including the walls) they are comparable to the baths in the most important Lycian cities. An acropolis was added to the city in the middle Byzantine period. A middle Byzantine church is located near it. File:Trebenna.jpgLower part of Trebenna.

This allows him to get close to things and people and, most of all, to give a presence to his own gaze in his film. Breton's non-fiction films are produced by Serge Lalou, Les Films d'Ici.  Biography  Breton lived several years in the New Guinea Highlands, in the Indonesian province of Papua, where he did an anthropological fieldwork for many years. There, he filmed Them and Me (Eux et moi, 63 min, 2001). Shot behind the scenes, from the point of view of a subjective camera, the film shows his ambiguous relations and negotiations with the people of this small village lost in the mountains. His second film in New Guinea, Heaven in a Garden (Le ciel dans un jardin, 62 min, 2003), follows the last journey, reflective and nostalgic, of the ethnographer. One's gaze is attracted to the poetry of small things. It is a film about the stream of time and remembrance. He directed A Silent Summer (Un √©t√© silencieux, 52 min, 2005), a film that takes place on the summer pastures of Kyrgyzstan, in the Tian Shan Mountains, not far from China. Through the attention it pays to ordinary moments, the film describes the solitude and arguments of shepherds living in the same tent, as well as that of the filmmaker, present but unnoticed, remote from their gazes. He shot The Outside World (Le monde ext√©rieur, 54 min, 2007) in the streets of Paris. This cinematic essay is a dreamlike straddling of worlds as well as a poetical and nonsensical, lilliputian ethnography. In a way, it is Them and Me in reverse: the filmmaker now turns his camera on the people who live in his \\"village\\", whom he observes through the candid eye of a fictitious, foreign friend, who is unaware of crowds and cities, and to whom he talks about the most insignificant things. With Night Rising on Clouds (Nuages apportant la nuit, 30 min, 2007), he develops an experimental narrative using still, black-and-white pictures. It is the mysterious and eerie tale of a journey through an unknown, dark forest, with a musical score composed by Karol Beffa. He directed The Empty House (La maison vide, 52 min, 2008). Shot like a western without a gun, at a drunkard's distance, the film takes place in New Mexico among an ancient Spanish community eaten to rack and ruin by rust, beer, and dust storms. He shot Ascent to the Sky (La mont√©e au ciel, 52 min, 2009): in a small valley in Nepal, at the end of a path worn out by so many feet and so many centuries, two old shepherds escape from their village to climb the mountains: shit everywhere, purity of heart, bedazzlement. He shot in a train, in the middle of Russia, A Few Days Together (Quelques jours ensemble, 90 min, 2013): sixty thousand kilometres in the overheated third-class wagon of a train crossing the winter at the speed of a galloping donkey, in the company of an ex-serviceman of the Red Army with whom the filmmaker has been travelling for some time. The most unexpected characters get on and off, eat a bit, chat, lose themselves in their thoughts, snort, and most of all tell the story of their broken lives. He is editing The Departed (20 min, 2013), a video installation about people sleeping in a Russian train. He is currently preparing the shooting of Before Me, Dark Forests (Devant moi, les for√™ts sombres, 52 min, 2013), a film about a small Tatarian people in the Altay Mountains, in Russia. An anthropologist specialized in Melanesia, Breton is a member of the Laboratoire d‚Äôanthropologie sociale at the Coll√®ge de France. He is associate professor at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, where he teaches anthropology, semiotics and film.

In 1994, the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission placed a historical marker there to note the historic importance of the location. History On June 24, 1942 the United States Department of War announced the authorization and award of contracts totaling more than $3,000,000 for construction of a military installation near Shenango, Pennsylvania to receive, process, and forward both officers and enlisted men for service during World War II. Acquisition of land in Pymatuning Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania began almost immediately with cooperative landowners from a total of 26 farms paid an average of $70 per acre for their potato fields. The first parcel of 57 acres was purchased for $40,500 and included space for warehouses. An additional 114 acres were then acquired at a cost of $10,252. By the time land procurement ended in November 1942, 3,300 acres had been acquired at a total cost of $182,000.Miller, Earl and Art Williams. \\"Camp Reynolds: Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot,\\" retrieved online May 15, 2019. Initially, military leaders determined that time spent at the camp by individual members of the military would depend on the demand for replacements and each serviceman's branch of operations. Ultimately, more than a million troops passed through the camp on their way to East Coast ports of embarkation and the war's European theater of operations. Construction phase Upon receiving their contract awards, Gannett, Eastman, Fleming of Harrisburg, and Mellon-Stuart Construction Co. of Pittsburgh designed and built the encampment to last just three years, but also to be unlike any other military depot at the time. Upon completion, it would include barracks for 30,000 troops, chapels, dayrooms, fire stations and hundreds of fire hydrants, guest quarters, gymnasiums and three obstacle courses, a 100-bed hospital, latrines, libraries, mess halls, motor pool, post exchanges, rifle range, service clubs, theaters, and warehouses. The base would also be equipped with its own infrastructure, including more than 100 miles of electric lines, 25 miles of paved roads, 22 miles of water lines, two 250,000-gallon water tanks (painted in a large red-and white checker pattern and situated at the southern end of the encampment), a sewage treatment plant, 18 miles of sewer lines, and a waste disposal facility.Miller and Williams, \\"Camp Reynolds: Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot.\\" Civil Service examiners began taking applications for immediate employment hires. The project then ramped up quickly as thousands of engineers and construction workers arrived and 4,200 men employed by the main contractors and 24 subcontractors began working 10-hour days and six-day weeks after ground for the first supply building was broken near the overhead highway bridge on Route 18 on July 8. In short order, the War Department ordered the expansion of the camp's battalion area to accommodate an additional 30,000 troops, followed by a subsequent expansion of the camp's housing capacity to 90,000 troops.Miller and Williams, \\"Camp Reynolds: Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot.\\" Although trailer camps were established to handle the sudden influx of workers and their families, housing facilities were limited. As a result, Greenville's population increased by 60 percent - from 8,149 in 1940 to 13,015 in 1943 (or higher, according to Mellon-Stuart records which showed a workforce high of 16,500 at one point). Although the final project cost for construction of the entire camp complex was never officially announced, one figure revealed that just one segment of the project (10 dormitory units erected on the west side of Route 18 to provide housing for 180 families) cost $624,466. The cost for the entire camp complex was reported to have topped $19,000,000. Post-war, the ten dormitory units to the west of Route 18 were converted into a county-owned housing project (known today as Fay Terrace) while the 250,000-gallon, red and white water tanks continued to supply water to the area for many years, and helped contribute to the area's housing growth during the 1950s. Life at and beyond the camp During its heyday, the camp had its own post office and published its own weekly newspaper. Printed at the Record-Argus, the Victory News was distributed between April 15, 1943 and November 30, 1944. Servicemen also made their own fun, organizing baseball, boxing and track and field events, a drum and bugle corps, several dance bands, stage productions, and bowling, handball and basketball leagues with one cage tournament attracting roughly 23 GI teams. Allegheny, Westminster, Geneva, and Bethany Colleges also made exhibition basketball appearances.Miller and Williams, \\"Camp Reynolds: Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot.\\" Stage, screen and radio headliners also offered troops a break from military life. Among those making appearances at the camp were: Louis Armstrong, Bonnie Baker, Blue Barron, Major Bowes and his Amateur Hour, the Camel Caravan, Stu Erwin and the cast of \\"Goodnight Ladies\\", Judy Garland, Benny Goodman, the Harmonic Rascals, Andy Kerr, Wayne King, the Mills Brothers, Olsen and Johnson's \\"Helzapoppin\\", June Preisser, Art Rooney, contralto Alice Stewart, Bob Strong, the cast of the \\"Truth or Consequences\\" radio show, and Virginia Weidler. Boxers Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson, Two- Ton Tony Galento, and Fritzie Zivic also made appearances, as did billiard experts Irving Crane and Charles Peterson, members of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians, Governor Edward Martin, and a number of touring OSO shows and amateur theatrical groups from Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Ohio, Youngstown, Ohio, and Sharon, Pennsylvania.Miller and Williams, \\"Camp Reynolds: Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot.\\" In addition, attractive bus and rail fares enabled many soldiers to travel to Sharon, New Castle, Farrell, Youngstown, and other nearby cities to seek rest and relaxation before their departure overseas, and the United Service Organization (USO) also helped ensure that men were kept busy during their off-duty hours away from camp. With help from the War Department, the organization built an $86,000 recreation center in Greenville's Riverside Park, where 812,530 servicemen were entertained over an 18-month period; 475,000 men also visited the USO's Buhl Club in Sharon.Miller and Williams, \\"Camp Reynolds: Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot.\\" Commanders Camps Shenango and Reynolds had six commanders. First to arrive during the very early construction days was Lt. Col. G.H. Sunderman, who came Oct. 1, 1942, and was followed by a quartermaster detachment of seven men from Fort Monroe, VA. On Nov. 4, Lt. Col. George H. Cherrington arrived and was followed by the first components of the headquarters company from New Cumberland, PA. Colonel Zim E. Lawhon took over on May 27, 1943, coming from the general staff of the War Department. It was during Colonel Lawhon's command that the name of the camp was changed from Shenango on September 21, 1943,Victory News, September 23, 1943, Volume 1, No. 24 to Reynolds in honor of General John F. Reynolds, who was a hero of the Civil War and had been felled by a Confederate sharpshooter on the opening day of the Battle of Gettysburg. After Lawhon's death came Col. George E. Couper, who commanded until Dec. 23 when Brig. Gen. Jesse A. Ladd was designated commander. He served in that capacity until the replacement depot was deactivated to the Indiantown Gap Military Reservation on Dec. 11, 1944. After his departure Camp Reynolds assumed a ghost town appearance. The last commander was Lt. Co. George Blaney. He took over after the post became the army's first full-time canvas and webbing repair facility. At that time it had a complement of about 300 to man the hospital and to guard the more than 1,000 German prisoners of war. Repatriation of the last prisoners was completed in mid-January 1946. After the camp's final deactivation the Trimble Company of Pittsburgh was awarded the general contract for razing the hundreds of barracks. The city of Erie acquired 200, Cleveland more than 100, Jamestown, NY 50, Johnstown 50, Connellsville 30, etc. The city of Pittsburgh and several area colleges, among them Thiel, Allegheny, and Westminster, bought additional dozens, as did many individuals seeking to convert them to garages, hunting camps, and other uses. How the many other structures and facilities and the campsite itself were acquired by the Greenville Business Men's Association for future industrial and residential development. The community, now known as Reynolds, had not one but three names during its wartime history. In 1942 Reynolds came into being as the Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot and was originally named for the nearby village of Shenango. On railroad timetables it bore the Victory, PA designation. Possibly because the original name was somewhat unwieldy, the War Department decreed in July 1943 that the military depot should bear the name of Camp Reynolds in honor of one of the Keystone State's military heroes of the American Civil War. The new designation paid tribute to the memory of Major General John Fulton Reynolds, one of the 51 Union generals ‚Äòwho died in battle during the Civil War‚Äô. He was killed by a 16-year-old Confederate sharpshooter on July 1, 1863, the first day of the bloody action at Gettysburg. John F. Reynolds was one of the most universally admired officers of the Army of the Potomac. A compassionate man, he was said to be genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of the soldiers under his command. German prisoners When World War II began to wind down there were still more than 1,800 German prisoners of war housed in Camp Reynolds barracks. They were among the 15,000-plus German POWS under army control in the Maryland- Pennsylvania-West Virginia area near the war's end. Most of these men had been put to work in area industries and logging camps to relieve the manpower shortage even though this practice stirred public criticism in some areas. They were assigned to factories and plants in the Shenango Valley, Meadville, Youngstown, and Warren, OH. There is no record of any German soldiers assigned to Greenville shops or plants. Under terms of the Geneva Convention all of the prisoners with the exception of officers could be made to work as the U.S. Army saw fit. Some worked at logging camps in the area of North East, Kane, Sheffield, and Marienville. According to John Gessner, who was an Army captain at the time and worked with the Germans on frequent occasions, still other prisoners worked at the Reynolds sewing center after the civilian employees had left for the day. Now an attorney living in Cortland, OH, Gessner recalled that for the most part the Germans were a docile lot. There was one occasion in November 1945 when it became necessary to place 280 of the POWs on a bread- and-water diet after they staged a sit-down strike because their Nazi spokesman had been shipped out of camp. The strike was short-lived. A few of the prisoners did attempt to escape from Reynolds but in all instances except one the escapees were caught and returned to camp. One man who got away never was captured. Perhaps the most notorious of the Reynolds' escapees was a young man named Heinz Golz. He attempted three escapes. He was recaptured the first time near Oil City and on another occasion had to be rescued by police from atop a suburban Pittsburgh dwelling where he had been chased by two dogs. In October 1945 a total of 450 German war prisoners were brought to Reynolds after a detainee camp at North East had been closed. About the same time others held at Kane, Marienville and Sheffield arrived at Reynolds to await repatriation. Some 500 more were moved out on the 25th day of November, with several hundred more awaiting their turn to depart for their homeland. The army's Center for Military History reported that the total number of prisoners based at Reynolds at the end of the conflict totaled 1,868, including 1,839 enlisted men and 29 non-commissioned officers. Not long before the last of the prisoners departed several hundred of their number was ushered into a post theater and shown motion picture footage they probably never will forget during the balance of their lives. This first area showing of the U.S. Signal Corps films depicting the Nazi atrocities at Adolph Hitler's death camps visibly disturbed the POWs. Many reportedly insisted that the horror scenes taken at Dacha and elsewhere were fakes turned out by U.S. propagandists. The German people were incapable of such atrocities, they said. The prisoner of war camp, which had been established April 4, 1944, was discontinued Jan, 15, 1946, approximately one month after the closing of the military camp itself. The race riot The manner in which many black soldiers were treated during the early days and months of the Shenango Personnel Replacement Depot (SPRD) operation is a blot the War Department has never been proud of and has always been reluctant to talk about. When the SPRD was conceived during the early phase of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's military units were strictly segregated. At the local depot there were separate barracks, post exchanges, theaters and other facilities for white and black troops. Southern officers and GIs especially did not mix well with the Negroes and consequently the treatment of the blacks probably was what was considered to be about normal for that period in history. There was no civil rights movement at the time, nor were there marches or demonstrations to advance the cause of the minorities. Some excesses in the treatment of blacks during the early days of the camp were evident, however. For example, the late Joseph G. Magargee of Greenville, a civilian employee at the camp who later became a Reynolds High School teacher and something of an authority on camp history, once recalled how the first contingent of blacks were not fed at the base but were placed in leg chains and trucked to the nearby Blue Sky Inn for their meals. Magargee wrote that according to the Blue Sky owner the black troops were not permitted to enter the inn when Southern soldiers were inside. Under military guard, the blacks were served their meals outdoors on the parking lot. Before he died a few years back Magargee also mentioned that in the camp's early days there was but a single theater for Negroes although they were permitted to occupy the back row seats in a theater for whites. The only other entertainment originally afforded the black troops consisted of card games, pick-up baseball and other diversions of their own making. It came as no great surprise, then, that the ill feelings harbored by some blacks and whites alike eventually flared into an ugly race riot that ended up with a deadly exchange of gunfire lasting several hours. Area newspapers and radio stations (there was no television in those days) did their level best to get a line on what transpired that mid-July day in 1943. The camp's public relations officials would say only that one black soldier had been killed and six others wounded in a racial flare-up. This was later described as a \\"spoon-fed\\" accounting of the rioting. The Department of the Army's Center of Military History, in response to communication from this writer and Congressman Tom Ridge, supplied one version of the flare-up by providing a single page copied from Ulysses Lee's publication titled The Employment of Negro Troops. Lee wrote that not all of the violence and disorder in which Negro troops became involved resulted from racial friction or mass grievances. Much of it was purely indigenous in nature, sometimes growing out of cultural traits and patterns of behavior brought into the Army from Civilian life. In the Camp Shenango instance an altercation between Negro and white soldiers in the post exchange area expanded until it involved a large number of troops in the exchange area. This first instance, brought under control by white and Negro military police using tear gas, was followed by another when two new prisoners, picked up for a pass violation, spread news of the earlier fracas to men in the guardhouse. Negro prisoners broke out of the guardhouse and joined by other soldiers, seized firearms and munitions from supply rooms. Military police, again white and Negro, killed one and wounded five other soldiers in quelling the second disturbance. John W. Kerpan, now a Greenville funeral director, was a first lieutenant and second in command of the camp's military police forces at that time of the rioting. He recalls that after several white soldiers went into the 10th Street post exchange for blacks a number of the Negroes retaliated by attempting to enter the white PX on Seventh Street. The blacks met with stiff resistance. Tempers flared and the resulting melee soon got out of hand. Kerpan's recollection is that at least two Negro soldiers were killed and several others probably were wounded in the resulting gunfire which lasted from about 5 o'clock in the afternoon until long after dark. Some of the black troops disappeared under the cover of darkness but were later picked up in various communities throughout Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio. The rioters were immediately sent to overseas destinations. William F. Kerfoot, Sr., now of the Vernon, OH area, was a military police sergeant who said that he had a \\"front row seat\\" during the gunfire display in which not a single military policeman was wounded. After the rioting, Kerfoot said, he was working in the provost marshal's office and heard that 30 to 35 black soldiers were killed that day and many more were wounded. Studs Terkel, the Chicago author who won a general non-fiction Pulitzer prize for his The Good War, an Oral History of World War II, presented still another version of the Camp Shenango rioting after interviewing Dempsey Travis, now a Chicago realtor. Travis was 21 and black and an Army private when he arrived at Shenango aboard a \\"Jim Crow train.\\" He told Terkel that on the day of the flare-up he and a friend he knew only as \\"Kansas\\" had just emerged from a theater to find a group of blacks engaged in what he described as a \\"big discussion.\\" He claimed that a caravan of six trucks loaded with white soldiers arrived at the scene and began shooting at the blacks. \\"Kansas\\" was killed on the spot, Travis said, and he himself fell with three gunshot wounds in the hip and legs which resulted in several months of hospitalization. While in the base hospital, Travis claimed he \\"saw 14 or 15 wounded blacks within a radius of 40 feet.\\" He recalled a Red Cross worker saying that \\"I don't know how may died and how many were wounded.\\" He maintained that the hostilities were not completely quelled for 48 to 72 hours. The public may never know for certain how many Negro soldiers were killed or wounded that day in July. At least some of the facts about this unsavory chapter of the camp's history are finally in the public realm and may help to put many rumors at rest at long last. The Conversion How Camp Reynolds was converted to its present stature as an industrial-residential community after the war. When the war ended and plans were under way for abandonment of the camp a wide variety of ideas for its post-war use sprang up. Many concerned people wanted to see the land developed rather than watch it revert to potato farms.. The idea of developing an air express terminal was advanced by more than half a dozen Mercer County communities. The site was approved by the Pennsylvania Aeronautics Commission, but the project never got off the ground. Community leaders from Greenville and Sharon, together with other interests from throughout the county, then came up with another idea and attempted to conclude arrangements for the building of a 1,800-bed veteran's hospital. Test borings were made but this effort also came to naught when word came from President Harry S. Truman that the Reynolds site was \\"unsuitable.\\" The White House directed the Veterans Administration to proceed with plans for development of the veterans‚Äô hospital at Deshon, near Butler. By this time the War Assets Administration controlled the area for disposition. In 1946 Silas Moss was elected president of the Greenville Business Men's Association (GBMA) and work began in earnest to acquire Camp Reynolds to be developed industrially for the benefit of the entire area. With behind-the-scenes help from Congressman Carroll D. Kearns, many months of work ensued until finally, in the summer of 1947, fifty-seven acres of the camp, including the warehouse area with buildings totaling 251,164 square feet of floor space and some two miles of railroad sidings, were purchased by the GBMA. The original price the government was asking for the 57 acres was $200,000 but the trustees managed to have the figure reduced to $40,500. The businessmen sold the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, located in Sharon, the idea of leasing three of the warehouses. They also entered into an agreement whereby lessor would pay the first year's rent in advance and, as a result, the association could be certain of eventually having an additional $30,643 added to the GBMA funds on a three-year lease- purchase agreement. Gamble paid off One troublesome problem remained. The association could not charge Westinghouse rent for property it did not own. In order to expedite the collection of the rental from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, three members of the association, Luther Kuder, Norman Mortensen, and Jess Dart, supplied $38,000 from their own resources and $2,500 was allocated and borrowed from the GBMA's post-war fund. The total amount was paid to the War Assets Administration and after a lapse of five months the deed for the property arrived on Oct. 27, 1947. The loans were repaid without interest. After having rented the balance of the warehouse area to three other firms on three-year lease-purchase arrangements, the trustees turned their attention to additional lands. Another problem was encountered. William Templeton, who owned 258 acres of land in the center of the area, induced many of the former landowners to exercise their priority to re-purchase their land. Then he attempted to buy their land from them. After months of negotiations the trustees were able to purchase all of the land in the area with the exception of that owned by Mr. Templeton. Negotiations with an engineering firm for development of the site already had begun and the land belonging to the association completely surrounded Mr. Templeton's 258 acres with the exception of his property's east boundary. After several more conferences Mr. Templeton offered to sell his property. His offer was accepted and the purchase was made. After purchasing the area the association trustees and acquired five additional structures with floor space of over 300,000 square feet, over two miles of railroad sidings, about eight miles of paved roads, 639,000 square yards of walks, parking areas and water-bound roads. The purchase price for the land and buildings was $76,629. By the end of 1950 the association had received about $170,000 from rentals and lease-purchase agreements. There were enough surpluses to allow the trustees to make loans to under-capitalized firms that were attracted to the area. In 1949 there were 10 new industries at Reynolds. During 1950 a total of 61 one-family homes were built and sold within the limits of the area The following year the size of the project and the volume of transactions made it impossible for committee members to handle the project on their own. At that time they hired Robert B. Parker, Jr., a graduate engineer who had previously represented an engineering consulting firm not only in the building of Camp Reynolds but as a professional consultant to the committee. In addition to serving as managing engineer for Reynolds Development, Parker became general manager of the water company, the sewage disposal company and the Pymatuning Independent Telephone Company. Prior to Parker's arrival operation of the development corporation was under the control of a board of trustees appointed by officers and directors of the Business Men's Association. Industrial parks Today there are three industrial parks totaling over 1,200 acres. They are the largest planned and managed industrial developments in the Tri-State area and are located in a metropolitan area of approximately 130,000 persons. The parks are owned and operated by Greenville-Reynolds Development Corporation. The original park consisted of a 430-acre portion of the one-time army training center now occupied by numerous industrial, warehouse, and service-related operations. An additional 40-acre site called the Reynolds North Industrial Park was opened in the late 1980s to meet a demand for smaller, fully developed business sites. In the early 1990s the corporation acquired and began the development of a new 750-acre tract located east of the Shenango River, known as Reynolds East. The United States Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration contributed $990,000 to help get the park project off the ground. Overer 45 industrial, warehouse, and servicerelated operations are located at Reynolds. Still other Reynolds firms provided a wide variety of design and building services, warehouse distribution, auto repair and detailing, upholstering, miscellaneous storage, aluminum smelting, structural steel and building erection, metal recovery, hydrous ammonia distribution and technical engineering service to a 30-state area, paving contracting, auction services, telecommunication products and services, general construction, tin mill processing, retail building products, distribution of vinyl and aluminum siding, warehousing, general contracting, and warehouse operations. Also operating under the Reynolds Development umbrella are the Reynolds Water Company and the Reynolds Disposal Company. The original water company had a supply of five million gallons available daily, which was enough to supply a small city. Reynolds schools Only one elementary school building was located on the land selected by the government for what eventually was to become Camp Reynolds. It was known as the Rocky View School and was said to be a perfect example of the \\"little red schoolhouse\\" type. All but two of the families sending children to Rocky View resided within the confines of the camp area. In the late 1950s Reynolds High School was constructed and graduated its first class in 1961. The Reynolds school system area embraces 98 square miles. In addition to the junior-senior high building the system includes one elementary building located beside the high school.

Reed's Store was the most successful store in Copperopolis until 1867, when a fire and the declining copper industry greatly diminished the town's population.

As relations are bidirectional, if miniKanren is given an expression and a desired output, miniKanren can run the expression \\"backward\\", finding all possible inputs to the expression that produce the desired output. This bidirectional behavior allows the user to constrain both the input to the program and the result of the program simultaneously. miniKanren performs an interleaved search which will eventually find any solution that exists, even if any one branch of the search tree is infinitely long and contains no solutions. If no solution exists, miniKanren may search forever if the search tree is infinite. An example of miniKanren code is \`evalo\`, a relational goal that relates expressions to the values that they evaluate to. When \`evalo\` is called in miniKanren like so: \`(evalo q q)\`, it will generate quines, that is, expressions \`q\` that when run will evaluate to themselves. The book The Reasoned Schemer uses miniKanren to demonstrate relational programming, and provides a complete implementation in Scheme. The core of the language fits on two printed pages. The Scheme implementation of miniKanren is designed to be easily understood, modified, and extended. Œ±leanTAP is a program written in Œ±Kanren, an extension of miniKanren for nominal logic. Given a theorem, it can find a proof, making it a theorem-prover. Given a proof, it can find the theorem, making it a theorem-checker. Given part of a proof and part of a theorem, it will fill in the missing parts of the proof and the theorem, making it a theorem-explorer. There are implementations of miniKanren in Haskell, Racket, Ruby, Clojure, JavaScript, Scala, Swift and Python. The canonical implementation is an embedded language in Scheme. The Clojure core.logic library was inspired by miniKanren. The name kanren comes from a Japanese word () meaning \\"relation\\".

Description  The material is a thin elastic film that contains nano-sized pores. When in a normal relaxed state, if droplets of liquid are applied to the film, they will roll freely along the smooth surface. However, when the film is stretched, any droplets of liquid that are applied to the film will be held in place on the film. If the tension on the film is later released, the film will return to its normal relaxed state, and the droplet will again move along the smooth surface.

Vacancy Under the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act of 1707 and a number of subsequent Acts, MPs appointed to certain ministerial and legal offices were at this time required to seek re-election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885‚Äì1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 pxiv The by-election in Derby was caused by the appointment of the sitting Liberal MP, William Vernon Harcourt as Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Times, 4 February 1886, p5 Candidates Liberals Harcourt had been MP for Derby since 1880 when he had won the seat in a by-election. Before that he had been MP for Oxford, having first been elected there at the 1868 general election. In 1880 he was appointed Home Secretary in Gladstone's second administration and had to resign to seek re-election in Oxford. He was however narrowly beaten by his Conservative opponent, Alexander William Hall at the subsequent by-election on 8 May 1880. To enable Harcourt to return to Parliament and take up his appointment as Home Secretary, a seat was found for him at Derby by the resignation of the sitting Liberal MP Samuel Plimsoll.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1832‚Äì1885; Macmillan Press, 1977 p105 On becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer in February 1886, Harcourt had to resign again to seek re-election in Derby. Conservatives Derby was two member seat and very safely Liberal. Since the 1832 general election there had been only two occasions when the Conservatives had taken one of the two seats for the borough.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1832‚Äì1885; Macmillan Press, 1977 pp. 104‚Äì105 Harcourt had been unopposed at his 1880 by- election and held a substantial majority over the sole Conservative candidate who had stood at the general election of 1885.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885‚Äì1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p102 Against this electoral background it is unsurprising that the Tories chose not to stand a candidate against Harcourt this time.The Times, 8 February 1886, p7 Moderate Liberals It had been reported on 6 February that it was not at that point a certainty that Harcourt would be unopposedThe Times, 6 February 1886, p6 and there was talk of what was described as a 'moderate Liberal' being brought forward in support of Lord Hartington. Hartington had broken with Gladstone on the issue of Irish Home Rule, although had not yet formed the Liberal Unionist Party. It was thought however, as the day of the by- election approached, that there was not enough time to get such a candidate into the field.The Times, 8 February 1886, p6 The campaign The writ for the by-election was moved in Parliament on 4 February by Arnold Morley, who went on to be the new government's Chief Whip, along with a number of writs for other seats involving newly appointed ministers in Gladstone's third administration. These included Gladstone himself, Joseph Chamberlain and Henry Campbell-Bannerman amongst others.The Times, 5 February 1886, p8 In an election address to his former constituents, Harcourt promised to support the government of Mr Gladstone and in particular to assist in finding a solution to the Irish question. The Times, 6 February 1886, p5 It was clear that Ireland and the consequences of Home Rule were the over-riding issue of the day, as the possibility of a moderate Liberal opponent had foreshadowed. In a further speech to Liberals in Derby, Harcourt placed his trust in Gladstone to ensure that whatever concessions were made in respect of Ireland these would not be at the expense of the maintenance of social order, the supremacy of the Crown or the unity of the Empire. .The Times, 9 February 1886, p10 As it turned out there were many Liberals who felt that, when it came, Gladstone's Home Rule Bill did not fulfil these criteria.Ian Cawood, The Liberal Unionist Party: A History; I B Tauris, 2012 p41 The result There being no nominations for any candidate but Harcourt, he was declared elected unopposed by the returning officer, the Mayor of Derby, on 9 February 1886.The Times, 10 February 1886, p10 The votes References See also *List of United Kingdom by-elections *United Kingdom by-election records *1916 Derby by- election Category:1886 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1886 in England Category:19th century in Derbyshire Category:Politics of Derby Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Derbyshire constituencies Category:Unopposed ministerial by-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in English constituencies Category:February 1886 events ","title":"1886 Derby by-election"},{"id":"39116622","text":"William \\"Joe\\" Raby (3 July 1873 ‚Äì 18 December 1954) was an English footballer who scored 44 goals from 156 appearances in the Football League playing for Lincoln City (in two spells), Gainsborough Trinity (in three spells), Stockport County and Doncaster Rovers. He played as an inside forward. He also played in the Midland League for Gainsborough and Wellingborough, and in the Southern League for Tottenham Hotspur. Life and career Raby was born in Heighington, Lincolnshire, in 1873, the son of Charles Raby, a gardener, and his wife Catherine.1891 England and Wales Census Piece: RG12/2589, Folio: 147, Page: 56. Accessed via FreeCEN. He played local football in Lincoln before joining the city's professional club, Lincoln City. He made his first-team debut towards the end of the 1891‚Äì92 Football Alliance season, and was to play infrequently over Lincoln's first two seasons in the Football League. He moved on to Gainsborough Trinity, then playing in the Midland League. Raby was short of stature, and in the early part of his career was noted for his pace. In 1895, Raby scored twice for Gainsborough to defeat his former club Lincoln City in the final of the Lincolnshire Challenge Cup. When he joined Gainsborough, Lincoln had retained his Football League registration, which caused problems when Gainsborough were elected to that league ahead of the 1896‚Äì97 season. Raby made it clear that he intended to stay with Gainsborough, and his transfer was approved in time for him to begin the season with that club. He made a brief return to Lincoln, before leaving Gainsborough for Midland League club Wellingborough in 1898. Raby had scored for Wellingborough against Tottenham Hotspur in a United League match late in the 1898‚Äì99 season, and went on to sign for that club for the coming season. He made only five first-team appearances, three in the Southern Combination and two in the Southern League, without scoring, and signed on for his third spell with Gainsborough ahead of the 1900‚Äì01 Football League season. After two seasons, in which he scored at a rate of one goal every three games, Raby signed for Stockport County. He scored Stockport's first goal at their new Edgeley Park ground in a 1‚Äì1 draw with former club Gainsborough Trinity in September 1902. After two seasons, Stockport were unsuccessful in their application for re- election to the league, and Raby left the club to finish his career at Doncaster Rovers. Raby died in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, in 1954 at the age of 81.

It has a history of over 800 years in the teaching and learning of law. Oxford's law school is currently ranked first in the world in the 2019 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. It is unique in its use of personalised tutorials, in which students are taught by faculty fellows in groups of one to three on a weekly basis, as the main form of instruction in its undergraduate and graduate courses. It offers the largest doctoral programme in Law in the English-speaking world. The faculty is part of Oxford's Social Sciences Division.  History  There were faculties of Civil Law and Canon Law in the medieval University. During the Reformation, Henry VIII prohibited the teaching of Canon Law, instead founding the Regius Chair of Civil Law, one of the oldest Professorships at the University of Oxford. From then until the 19th century, the University awarded the Bachelor of Civil Law and the Doctor of Civil Law, through the Faculty of Civil Law. William Blackstone, a graduate of Pembroke College, Oxford and subsequently a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, was appointed the inaugural Vinerian Professor of English Law in 1758, and was the first professor at any university to teach the common law. His lectures formed the basis for his Commentaries on the Laws of England, a definitive source of and case for the study of the English common law. It was not until the 1870s that Oxford offered a degree in English law, the BA in Jurisprudence. Not long after, Cornelia Sorabji was the first woman to read Law at Oxford in 1889. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were prominent professors in Oxford such as Frederick Pollock, William Anson, and Albert Dicey. The emergence of a large community of legal scholars in twenty-five men's colleges can be dated from the 1920s and 1930s, but the development was consolidated in the 1950s and 1960s, when Law Fellowships also became common in the women's colleges. The Oxford law school flourished through the operation of the resulting internal market, and through the brilliance of particular leading scholars such as H. L. A. Hart, Rupert Cross, Tony Honor√©, John Morris, Peter Carter, and others. In the twentieth century, the BCL became a master's level degree; and, by the 1970s, Oxford developed a large graduate programme in law. It has been claimed that the BCL at Oxford is \\"the most highly regarded taught masters-level qualification in the common law world\\". The DPhil in Law, which dates to the 1910s, became popular at that time particularly in international law, comparative law, and philosophy of law; after the 1970s, the areas of research pursued in the doctoral programme broadened to make it a general training ground for legal academics. In 2010 the MSc in Law and Finance (MLF) was introduced and is taught jointly by the Faculty of Law and the Sa√Ød Business School. The MLF programme involves a combination of finance and economic courses combined with BCL law courses. Like the BCL taught at Oxford, entry into the MLF is highly competitive with on average less than fifteen per cent of applicants being accepted.  Programmes offered  Undergraduate programme The BA in Jurisprudence is Oxford's regular three-year undergraduate law degree, equivalent to what in some universities would be called an LLB. It is also a 'qualifying law degree' for the purpose of practice as a solicitor or barrister in England and Wales. It is 'one of the most highly regarded undergraduate law degrees in the UK, and those who do well in it are in high demand both in the legal professions and in other fields in which professional analytical work is required'. Graduate programmes: BCL, MJur and MSc Law and Finance The BCL, MJur, and MSc in Law and Finance are the only graduate law degrees in the world which are taught through tutorials as well as seminars and lectures. Oxford's graduate law students have closer contact with their teachers than on any LLM. Oxford is renowned for the size, strength, and diversity of its community of legal scholars who are drawn from around the world, and students benefit from the opportunities they are given to discuss their work with leading academics in the field. These graduate programmes have an acceptance rate of around 5%. The Oxford BCL degree has been a pivotal feature of Oxford‚Äôs law provision since the sixteenth century. This rich history has helped to maintain its status as the most highly regarded taught masters-level qualification in the common law world. Since 1991, the Magister Juris (MJur) degree has established a similar outstanding reputation for students from non-common law backgrounds. The Oxford's MSc in Law and Finance (MSc) is delivered jointly by Oxford's Faculty of Law and Sa√Ød Business School. MLF candidates study the law courses alongside BCL students and attend finance courses alongside MSc in Financial Economics students. MLF candidates arrive having graduated at or near the top of their undergraduate class, often combined with several years of professional experience. They leave with graduate level training in finance and economics, along with a sophisticated understanding of the complex transactional and policy issues at the intersection of law and finance. Research programmes Oxford has the largest graduate research programme in Law in the English-speaking world, with a community of about 200 research students engaged in master's and doctoral research across a wide range of legal and interdisciplinary specialisms corresponding to the diverse interests of faculty members. Research students play a central role in the intellectual life of the Faculty, collaborating in numerous discussion groups and seminars. Research programs include: the Master of Studies in Legal Research (MSt) - an entry-level one-year research degree that can also serve as the first year of a DPhil; the Master of Philosophy in Law (MPhil) - a one-year research degree that can also serve as the first year of a DPhil, available only to those proceeding from the Oxford BCL or MJur taught postgraduate programmes; the Master of Letters (MLitt) - an intermediate-level two-year research degree; the Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) - a major research degree requiring three to four years of study and setting the highest standards of academic achievement.  Rankings and reputation  Oxford's Law Faculty consistently ranks among the top three worldwide. Oxford is currently ranked first in the UK and first in the world in the 2019 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Its average acceptance rate was less than 5% in between 2016-2019. Oxford's BCL programme has been described as \\"the most highly regarded taught masters-level qualification in the common law world\\". A first-class in undergraduate degree in Law or equivalent is a prerequisite (as a guide a student will need to be in the top 5% of his or her graduating class), with the same applying for the MJur and Masters in Law and Finance. For research programmes, an outstanding record in earlier higher education and the skills and commitment to pursue research to the highest level are required by applicants for postgraduate research programmes. It is very rare for a candidate to be admitted without having completed a degree in Law, except in socio-legal studies and criminology.

Life He was son of Sir James Lockhart XI of Lee, of a lairdly family, by his wife, Jean Weir of Stonebyres, Lanarkshire. While still a young man he was a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I, and was knighted. He sat in the Scottish parliaments of 1630 and 1633 as commissioner for Lanarkshire, and was appointed lord of the articles on 20 June 1633. Lockhart did not sit in the parliament of 1641, perhaps because of his adherence to the Marquis of Hamilton. In 1644, and again in 1645, he contested Lanarkshire against Sir William Hamilton, and on the second occasion with success: on the first there was a disputed return decided, 5 June 1644, in favour of Hamilton. On 1 February 1645 he was appointed a commissioner of the exchequer, and on 2 July 1646 an ordinary lord of session in succession to Lord Durie the elder, who had died. Lockhart took part in the engagement for the relief of King Charles in 1648, and under the Marquis of Hamilton commanded a regiment at the battle of Preston. On 16 February 1649, he was deprived of his office by the Act of Classes, and was banished with others by an act of the estates, 4 June 1650. He petitioned for the removal of his sentence of banishment, and on 5 December of the same year his banishment was annulled. On his return Lockhart became a member of the committee of estates, was chosen to superintend the levy for the invasion of England under Charles II. On 28 August 1651 he was surprised by a party of English parliamentarian soldiers at Blyth, and was made prisoner. He taken to Broughty Castle, and from there to England, where he was eventually placed in the Tower of London. Several years later Lockhart's son Sir William Lockhart interceded, and he was set free. In 1661 was restored to his seat on the bench, was sworn of the privy council in Scotland, and was again appointed a commissioner of the exchequer. In the parliaments of 1661, 1665, and 1669 be represented Lanarkshire, and was throughout a lord of the articles. In 1662 he opposed the Ejection Act at Glasgow; he was said have been the only man sober in the assembly. In 1671 Lockhart succeeded John Home, Lord Renton as lord justice clerk, and held that post till he died in May 1674. Family Lockhart's first wife was Helen, daughter of Alexander Fairlie of Braid.

The mission of the Valencia History Museum is to educate visitors about the historical development of the city of Valencia. The MhV depicts the past of Valencia in an informative and entertaining way, using traditional exhibition resources and new technologies. The project Construction of deposit (El Collado, 1932) The Valencia History Museum (MhV) was created by agreement of the Commission of Government of the Valencia City Council on January 12, 2001. Its mission is to promote the history of the city, from its origins to the present day, using elements of the local archaeological, artistic, and cultural heritage.Main access to the Museum The MhV aims to present the history of Valencia to visitors, portraying that history as something tangible, intelligible, and entertaining, while also giving perspective to political history, dates, battles or famous historic figures and focusing on social background, economic motives, ideology, and tradition. MhV was proclaimed \\"Cultural Project of the Year\\" by the ‚ÄúDiputaci√≥n de Valencia‚Äù in 2003. The building Hall entrance MhV The museum is located inside the first underground reservoir of drinking water in Valencia, which was built by Ildefonso Cerd√° (who later designed the Eixample of Barcelona) and Leodegario Marchessaux. The reservoir was inaugurated in 1850 and was the first of its kind in Spain. Built entirely in brick, it is an example of nineteenth-century Valencian industrial architecture. The restoration of the building was performed by the City Council between 1998 and 2001. Despite the museum being relatively out of reach of the Old City, the neighbouring Parque de Cabecera, less than 100 meters away, provides easy access to the city centre. On display The MhV's permanent exhibition is dedicated to the history of Valencia, divided into eight time periods: Treasure of Cheste Showcases Balansiya Detail Roman agape * Valentia (138 b.c.-711) * Balansiya (711-1238) * Valencia in the Middle ages (1238-1519) * The ‚ÄúGerman√≠as‚Äù to the ‚ÄúNueva Planta‚Äù (1519-1707) * Borbonicus municipality (1707-1833) * The City of Steam (1833-1917) * Truncated Modernity (1917-1975) and * The Valencia we have known (1975-2003) The Time Machine Mediateca Each time period shows a collection of objects, documents and works of art which bear witness to their time. In the centre of each block, there are two stands reconstructing historical settings of the city and projecting everyday scenes related to each period, so the visitor can choose any scene at will and get to know historical characters, by immersion in each world of experiences and aspirations. This format blends elements of a museum and a cinema, providing textual information through more dynamic media. Visitors can see everyday scenes relating to circumstances and characters of different periods, thus being able to get to know the protagonists of the history of Valencia. The showcases present a varied collection, ranging from archaeological objects to artistic works, archival documents, books, prints, maps, posters, machines, vehicles or toys, among others, collected not so much for their individual value as for their ability to evoke moments and contexts in history. Moreover, the MhV hosts regular temporary exhibitions on Valencia in general, and its history in particular, and offers an educational program for all audiences, which includes guided tours or workshops. The museum is equipped to recreate, using virtual reality, the appearance of the city throughout its twenty-two centuries of history in ‚ÄúLa m√°quina del tiempo (The Time Machine)‚Äù. The visitor can choose a time zone and browse it to get a bird's eye view, obtaining an avalanche of historical data on the city at any point along the way. The ‚ÄúMediateca (media library)‚Äù, finally, is a space designed for relaxation and reflection, where the visitor can enjoy hearing recited poetry or musical fragments from every moment in history, see old photos of Valencia and its inhabitants or freely consult a carefully chosen selection of works on the city.

Trollip J referred firstly to the general principle formulated by Kotze AJA in Madrassa Anjuman Islamia v Johannesburg Municipality,1917 AD 718 at 727. to the following effect: > If it be clear from the language of a statute that the Legislature, in > creating an obligation, has confined the party complaining of its non- > performance, or suffering from its breach, to a particular remedy, such > party is restricted thereto and has no further legal remedy; otherwise the > remedy provided by the statute will be cumulative. After considering the ambit of this general principle and its application to the statute with which he was dealing‚Äîit prescribed the payment of certain registration and licence fees for commercial vehicles‚ÄîTrollip J concluded that the remedies afforded the local authority by the ordinance were such as to negate any suggestion that the local authority could sue civilly to recover unpaid fees. The judge then proceeded to consider whether the statute also impliedly precluded the local authority from seeking an interdict to prevent the owner of the vehicles in question from using them until the arrear fees had been paid and the vehicles properly registered. The ordinance in question contained a provision making it an offence to operate a vehicle on a public road unless it was duly licensed. Trollip J quoted a dictum of Solomon JA in Madrassa case: > To exclude the right of a Court to interfere by way of interdict, where > special remedies are provided by statute, might in many instances result in > depriving an injured person of the only effective remedy that he has, and it > would require a strong case to justify the conclusion that such was the > intention of the Legislature.725. The judge went on to say, > It is true that the qualification‚Äîunless the statute otherwise provides‚Äîis > not incorporated in the well-known rule laid down by Solomon J (as he then > was) in Patz v Greene & Co 1907 TS 427 at 433. That decision has, on that > account, been criticised in certain decisions [....] But with respect I > think that in Patz v Greene & Co the Court was satisfied that the statute in > question had not expressly or by necessary implication excluded the civil > remedy of interdict (see at 434-5), and it was therefore primarily concerned > with the locus standi of the applicant to apply for the interdict (see the > argument at 427). Consequently, the rule there laid down accepted, I think, > that the right of interdict was available, and it was directed towards > defining the person or class of persons who had locus standi to claim its > enforcement. Thus, in the Madrassa case, at 726, the same learned Judge who > had announced the rule applied it to determine the locus standi of the > applicant [....] In my view, therefore, Patz v Greene Ltd does not add to or > conflict with the rule quoted above from [...] the Madrassa case. The case > will be referred to again later on the question of the present applicant's > locus standi. > Now the ordinance does not exclude, expressly or by necessary implication, > the remedy of interdict to enforce observance of s 4(1). That remedy, as > pointed out above, is applicable to future or continuing breaches; the > statutory remedy of prosecution and punishment under s 4(2) relates to past > breaches; and the two can therefore co-exist without any conflict. > Consequently the reasoning above for excluding the civil remedy for > recovering arrear fees and penalties does not apply. Hence, in my view, > future or continuing breaches of s 4(1) can be restrained by interdict.154F. On the question of whether or not the City Council had locus standi to seek an interdict, Trollip J held that, because the ordinance contained the provision prohibiting persons from operating unlicensed or unregistered vehicles on public roads, and because, in terms of other sections of the ordinance, a portion of licence fees paid by persons residing within the area of a local authority accrue to the local authority, the local authority in question had a sufficient \\"partial interest\\" to vest it with locus standi. The judge apparentlyThis, in Minister of Health v Woodcarb 1996 (3) SA 155 (N) 161F-G, was Hurt J's interpretation of Trollip J's judgment. did not consider the mere prohibition against operation of vehicles without compliance with the duty to register them an insufficient basis upon which to find that the local authority could interdict their unlawful operation.

The work consists of six parts giving a history of England and of the city of Bristol, a list of civic officers, and details of local customs and ceremonies.Toulmin Smith, pp.iii-xiv Commissioned by mayor William Spencer, the Kalendar was started circa 1478‚Äì79.Fleming, p 310, 315 Scribed on vellum, separated by leaves of parchment, the book was not reproduced in print until the nineteenth century in Lucy Toulmin Smith's edition, which omitted some of the content.Fleming, p 290 It is regarded as one of the earliest examples of a town chronicle outside London. Little is known of Ricart, apart from his office as town clerk and the possibility that he was a merchant, also known as Robert Ricardes. He also appears to have authored parts of the Great Red Book of Bristol, as well as the Little White Book.Fleming, pp 307‚Äì8 Both books contain references to his being common clerk and as a witness. His entries in the Kalendar date from 1479 until 1506. The Kalendar is held at Bristol Archives at their archives in Hotwells, Bristol. The original is fragile, but the contents may be viewed by microfiche. Synopsis Induction of the Mayor from Ricart's Calendar Prologue At the start of the book, Ricart details his plan for the execution of the work in six parts, although this plan was not in the end adhered to, he informs the reader that Spencer had commissioned the work to preserve the ancient customs of the town, for maynteyneng of the said fraunchises herafter more duely and freely to be executed and , and the perfaitter had in remembraunce.Ricart, Prologue (1497) In: The Maire of Bristowe is Kalendar (1497).

The section is based on earlier sources such as Wace's verse epic Roman de Brut, which in turn is based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae.Toulmin Smith, p iv The town of Bristol is represented as having been founded by Brennius, one of Brutus' sons. A short interlude at the end of the first part, describes Joseph of Arimathea's visit to Britain and an account of the founding of the abbey at Glastonbury in Somerset.Fleming, pp 292‚Äì293 Second part Covering the period from the Norman conquest up until the death of John, King of England in 1216, this section is based heavily on Matthew Paris' Flores Historiarum. Interpositions contain accounts of the building of Bristol Castle by the Earls of Gloucester and their founding of St. James' Priory, Fitzhardings' foundation of St. Augustine's Abbey, the ancestry of William the Bastard, and an account of the charter and privileges granted to Bristol by King John.Fleming, pp 297‚Äì298 Third part In this section, the material is listed under the terms of office of the town mayors, starting with Adam le Page in the earlier sections it was arranged by the reigns of kings. Much of the subject matter is derived from London chronicles of the time with little local content until the early fifteenth century, when information on grain prices, William II Canynges, local reaction to the Cornish Rebellion of 1497, ship losses, and bad weather started to appear alongside accounts of executions and the Wars of the Roses.Fleming, pp 301‚Äì3Toulmin Smith, p xviii Fourth part The fourth section contains descriptions of the oaths of office administered to civic officials, regulations for the sale of bread, coal, and other commodities, civic ceremonies, robes of office, and judicial matters.Toulmin Smith, pp xviii‚Äìxix Robert Ricart's map of Bristol Fifth part The whole of this section is a reproduction of the text of the 1374 charter, which granted Bristol civic status, together with the contents of King John's 118 charter.Fleming, pp 303‚Äì304 Sixth part The last section is mostly a transcription of a book belonging to Henry Darcy, Mayor of London in 1339, which is very similar to the Liber Albus or White Book, an account of the laws of the city of London, written by town clerk John Carpenter in 1419.Fleming, p 304 Illustrations The Kalendar contains eighteen illustrations, mostly depicting kings, but there is a notable plan of the town of Bristol, showing its principal features, and an illustration of the annual mayor making ceremony.Fleming, pp 304‚Äì5 Bibliography *Fleming, P.

The shopping centre, which opened in 2012, is part of a larger office and retail precinct on the airport's western boundary, adjacent to Majura Road. At the time of opening, the centre boasted Australia's largest Woolworths supermarket. The centre is also anchored by discount department store Big W and Toys \\"R\\" Us (including Babies \\"R\\" Us). In addition to the anchor tenants, there are over 30 specialty stores representing a variety of national chains, a 256-seat food court and Lollipop's Playland and Cafe - an air-conditioned, fully supervised children's playground. Outside of the centre, within the Majura Park precinct can be found Canberra's only (and Australia's third) Costco wholesale outlet, Jim Murphy cellars (the store closed in March 2017 and shifted to an express outlet within the centre), and a number of factory outlet stores. A medical and dental clinic opened in 2013, with on-site physiotherapy and pathology services. History The shopping centre was originally constructed as Brand Depot, a factory outlet mall in 2006 at a cost of $12.5 million. Brand Depot was intended to be constructed in three stages, eventually housing up to 120 retail stores. Due to the building's proximity to Canberra Airport's main runway, the use of construction cranes was restricted. The challenge was overcome with an mobile roll former developed by BlueScope Lysaght. The company manufactured long interlocking steel roofing segments onsite which were slid directly into position from the semi trailer mounted roller, eliminating the need for an overhead crane. Faced with increasing competition from a new Direct Factory Outlets centre at Fyshwick which opened in 2008. Legal challenges by the management of Brand Depot under the Trade Practices Act and concerns about zoning of the DFO site, echoing the 2004 Orange Grove affair failed to stop the development from proceeding. By February 2011, one-third of its 75 stores were vacant and the centre was struggling to attract new tenants. By March, Brand Depot closed following the loss of four more tenant stores. In June 2011, Woolworths Limited encouraged by the location and Costco's investment in a 13,500m¬≤ wholesale warehouse next door to the old Brand Depot, announced plans to renovate the building into a shopping centre which could accommodate large format stores representing several of the company's brands. Following the deal to redevelop the centre, Woolworths announced in August that it would further invest in the Majura Park precinct with the construction of a large Masters Home Improvement store to compete directly with Costco. The Masters store closed in late 2016.

A derivative of the third-generation Ford Econoline/Club Wagon, the Carousel explored a number of the concepts that 1980s American-market minivans later put into production, serving as an alternative to both full-size station wagons and passenger vans. Called a \\"garageable family van\\", the Carousel featured two-box design (as opposed to the one-box configuration of the Volkswagen Microbus) and three-row forward- facing seating. Designed and styled by Dick Nesbitt (designer of the Ford Mustang II), the Carousel prototype was built for Ford by Carron & Company of Inkster, Michigan. Development In 1972, Ford truck designers had begun final design work on the \\"Nantucket\\" design program, the codename for the 1975 Ford Econoline/Club Wagon. While moving its engine several inches forward would increase passenger space significantly, the body height of most versions of the Club Wagon were to be nearly 7 feet tall, having only several inches of clearance through an average garage door opening; the increased size decreased the functionality as a personal vehicle. In 1972, Lee Iaccoca directed the Ford Light Truck design studio to create a \\"garageable van\\" derivative of the \\"Nantucket\\" program under the \\"Carousel\\" codename. Along with lowering the roof of the Club Wagon passenger van approximately one foot (to six feet tall, closer in size to the first-generation Econoline), another design objective of the Carousel program was to give the vehicle more \\"automotive-like\\" styling. For its marketing, \\"Carousel\\" was intended for marketing to buyers of full- size station wagons and passenger vans; a production vehicle (a production name is unknown) would have slotted between the Ford LTD Country Squire and the Ford Club Wagon in terms of size and cargo capacity.  Overview  The Ford Carousel derived its chassis from the third-generation Econoline/Club Wagon (then in development) with a 124-inch wheelbase length (the standard wheelbase length for the Econoline from 1975 to 1987). The Carousel was styled with its own body, distinguished by a lower roofline. Lowered to a height of approximately six feet, the Carousel was designed with a height lower than the 6'4\\" Volkswagen Microbus. The Carousel prototype adopted its powertrain from the Econoline and the Country Squire, using a 460 V8 and Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission. The prototype Ford Carousel is a five-passenger vehicle; a flat-folding rear seat (to match the height of the load floor) was developed for the vehicle. As part of its development, several interior configurations were designed, including two rear bench seats and side-facing perimeter seats. To further attract buyers of station wagons, the roofline of the Carousel was styled with glass (in line with the mid-1950s Chevrolet Nomad); the exterior was fitted with simulated woodgrain siding. Similar to a station wagon, the rear door of the Carousel was equipped with a tailgate and retracting rear window. In line with the Club Wagon, the Carousel was equipped with front \\"captain's chairs\\". As a prototype, the Carousel adopted components from other Ford vehicles, including its dashboard from the Thunderbird, interior elements from the LTD Brougham (along with wheelcovers). Fate In 1973, the Carousel had been fabricated into a running prototype ready for production approval, potentially for a 1975-1976 launch. While winning the support of Henry Ford II, the Carousel faced internal opposition from other Ford executives, who feared that an unproven vehicle design would have potentially threatened sales of the (highly profitable) Ford LTD Country Squire and Mercury Colony Park. After the 1973 energy crisis and the recession of the mid 1970s, Ford was forced to cut back on new vehicle development. In 1974, Henry Ford II called for the end of the Carousel program, as it did not replace any existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury model line.  Epilogue  In 1978, Lee Iacocca was fired from Ford; several months later, Director of Product Planning Hal Sperlich also left the company. Soon after, both executives were hired in similar roles at Chrysler Corporation. This would lead to the development of the Chrysler minivans for the 1984 model year. While the overall construction of the 1984 Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan would differ greatly from the Ford Carousel (in their basis upon the Chrysler K-car compact sedan), they would follow a similar two-box layout, marketed as family vehicles with smaller garage footprints than full-size station wagons. At the same time Chrysler commenced minivan production, Ford revisited the idea of a garageable van for the first time. In 1984, the company revealed the Ford Aerostar for the first time; much like the Carousel, it was a prototype of an intended production vehicle. In mid-1985, the Aerostar commenced sales in production form. While fuel economy had played a key role in the demise of the Carousel, it would become a major factor behind the design of the Aerostar. In place of the full-size van platform, the Aerostar shared many components with the Ford Ranger light pickup truck. Foregoing the previous two-box design, in a design similar to the European Ford Transit, the Aerostar used a one-box design with the hood and windshield sloped at a similar angle. After the 1997 model year, the Aerostar was discontinued; Ford had largely replaced by 1995 with the Ford Windstar and the Mercury Villager (the latter built in a joint venture with Nissan). The Windstar would largely follow the design set in place by Chrysler, adopting front-wheel drive and unit-body construction based on a car platform.

It was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 26 September 2013 in hardback, e-book and audio editions, and in the US by HarperCollins on 8 October 2013. The plot centres on Bond's mission to the civil war in the fictional country of Zanzarin‚Äîa thinly veiled version of Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War‚Äîwhere he meets the local MI6 contact, Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant, and a Rhodesian mercenary, Kobus Breed. After being shot by Ogilvy-Grant, Bond tracks both people to Washington on a revenge mission, finally establishing that Breed is trafficking heroin into the US. Boyd closely based his version of the Bond character on Ian Fleming's, and eschewed any of the film versions. The novel is set in 1969‚Äîsix years after Fleming's last work was set‚Äîand Bond is 45 years old. Boyd was raised in Nigeria and used his experiences during the civil war to provide the location for the novel. He has been a Bond fan since his youth and, in preparation for writing the novel he read all the Bond stories in chronological order. It took 18 months to write the novel, with some friction between Boyd and the Fleming estate over the portrayal of Bond. Solo received mixed reviews, with a number of critics pointing to the convoluted and unstirring plot. Other critics saw the book as being equal with, or superior to, Fleming's stronger novels. The book sold well, appearing in the top ten-selling book lists in the UK. Plot After celebrating his 45th birthday alone at The Dorchester, Bond is sent to Zanzarim to bring a speedy end to the civil war in the country which has seen the delta region of the country split to form the Democratic Republic of Dahum. Before leaving for Africa, Bond visits Gabriel Adeka‚Äîthe rebel leader's brother‚Äîwho runs AfricaKIN, a London-based charity who send aid to Dahumni children; Gabriel tells Bond that he is not in contact with his brother Solomon, as the pair have fallen out. On his arrival in Zanzarim, Bond is aided by a local agent who introduces herself as Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant. The two travel from the capital city to the rebel enclave, but are attacked shortly before reaching their destination and taken captive by Kobus Breed, a mercenary assisting the rebels. The group are attacked on their return journey and Ogilvy-Grant goes missing in the confusion, while Bond escapes. Bond proceeds to the enclave, where he is met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist. Bond meets Solomon Adeka and realises that the leader will shortly die of cancer: his mission to kill Adeka is needless. Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment coming into the country, all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck; the aeroplanes all show the AfricaKIN name on the fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries to leave the country on one of the supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die. Bond is saved by a journalist he befriended and returns to the UK, where he spends time in a military hospital. After discharging himself, he decides to go on a revenge mission against Breed and Ogilvy-Grant. Discovering AfricaKIN has relocated to Washington DC, Bond travels to the US and tracks down both of them at the AfricaKIN offices. While conducting surveillance against the company, Bond is briefly detained by Brigham Leiter‚Äînephew of Felix‚Äîof the CIA, who explains Ogilvy-Grant also works for the CIA. Bond meets Ogilvy-Grant, who assures him that she shot to wound him in order that Breed would not shoot them both. The following day Bond watches a mercy flight bringing in maimed and injured Zanzarimi children; he dines alone and returns to his hotel to find that Breed has killed Ogilvy-Grant. Bond attacks the house where Breed is staying with the children, and incapacitates the mercenary, leaving him for dead. He establishes that the children are being used as drug mules to smuggle raw heroin into the country and locates Solomon Adeka, who had not been killed in Africa, but been turned into a heroin addict in order to control him. Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house. Characters and themes The central character of the novel is James Bond, the fictional MI6 agent created by Ian Fleming. The author, William Boyd modelled his version of the character on Fleming's version, which Boyd identified as being very different from the version seen in the films. Solo is set in 1969‚Äîsix years after Fleming's last work was set‚Äîand the novel begins with Bond celebrating his 45th birthday. Boyd altered aspects of the character, making him \\"an older, wiser Bond\\"'; while having coffee on the King's Road, Bond's \\"advancing age lends an undertone of poignancy to his almost detached observation of the bra-less, mini-skirted cavalcade\\". Boyd's version of Bond is \\"more impulsive, less emotionally guarded, and also more sadistic\\" than Fleming's, and he has the facility for extreme violence. According to The Sunday Times, Bond's \\"casual sexism has gone, to be replaced by a flaring lust that teeters on the edge of being out of control, and has to be reined in\\". The primary antagonist of the novel is Kobus Breed, a mercenary with a disfigured face and a permanently weeping eye who had previously served with the Rhodesian Light Infantry in Matabeleland; Olen Steinhauer, writing in The New York Times thinks the scarred villain to be \\"an obligatory nod toward the requirements of the Bond formula\\". Some writers are unimpressed with Breed; Robert Crampton of The Sunday Times thinks that the character \\"feels more like a henchman than a proper power-crazed villain. He has menace, but no ambition. You wait for the evil genius to turn up‚Äîbut he never does\\", while David Sexton in the London Evening Standard thinks the character \\"lacks charisma\\", and David Connett in the Sunday Express considers him \\"a colourless character in comparison with factual and fictional counterparts\\". The journalist Geoffrey Wansell in the Daily Mail disagreed and Breed, along with a second villain, millionaire Hulbert Linck, were as strong as some of Fleming's villains; Steinhauer also thought that the novel's villains were realistic, \\"motivated by simple greed yet clever enough to be legitimately dangerous\\". There are two main female characters in Solo‚Äîa horror film actress, Bryce Fitzjohn and the local MI6 contact Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant; rather like many of Fleming's female characters, both are \\"determined females who are not to be patronised by Bond\\". The main theme of the novel is revenge. Bond is stopped from leaving Zanzarim by Breed and subsequently shot and badly wounded by Ogilvy-Grant; he tracks down the pair to Washington and attempts to get his revenge. According to The Sunday Business Post, \\"this is where the author comes into his own, along with our hero, and it's all taken up a notch.\\" Associated with the revenge is treachery: it is a subject that recurred through Fleming's works, and Boyd uses it to provide a motive for Bond's mission of revenge. Background William Boyd, author of Solo, in 2009 On 31 March 2012 Boyd announced at the Oxford Literary Festival that he was working on a novel set in Africa. Boyd had lived in Nigeria‚Äî\\"where his mother was a teacher and his father a doctor\\"‚Äîduring the Nigerian Civil War, which \\"had a profound effect on him.\\" On 11 April 2012 the Fleming estate announced that Boyd would write a Bond novel to follow Jeffery Deaver's 2011 novel Carte Blanche. The civil war, over the attempted secession by Biafra from Nigeria, was the location for Solo, although Boyd renamed this as the fictional Zanzarim. On 15 April 2013 Boyd announced the book's title at the London Book Fair. The announcement was part of the \\"Author of the Day\\" event at the English Pen Literary Caf√©. Selected press were invited to the event and were given a brief opportunity to question Boyd about the book's title. Boyd believes the short title is \\"strikingly apt\\" for the novel. He remarked that \\"titles are very important\\" to him, and that as soon as he \\"wrote down Solo on a sheet of paper I saw its potential. Not only did it fit the theme of the novel perfectly, it's also a great punchy word, instantly and internationally comprehensible, graphically alluring and, as an extra bonus, it's strangely Bondian in the sense that we might be subliminally aware of the '00' of '007' lurking just behind those juxtaposed O's of SOLO\\". For background Boyd read all the Bond stories in chronological order; and had researched Fleming and the literary Bond's background. Boyd was a child when his father introduced him to Fleming's works. As a result, Boyd found himself also becoming fascinated with Ian Fleming. He told reporters that he was interested in Bond as a human being. \\"Bond is not just a superhero. He has flaws, he has weaknesses, he makes mistakes. ... That was Fleming's genius.\\" The novel is set in 1969 when Bond is 45; Boyd intentionally picked the year, further adding that \\"there are no gimmicks, it's a real spy story.\\" Boyd criticised how the filmmakers have portrayed Bond onscreen as a \\"cartoon character\\"; he also believes that Bond should be \\"troubled and a massive boozer.\\" The novel reflects Boyd's view, where Bond \\"drinks enough to float a boat. He drinks so much you wonder that he ever has the time or inclination to do anything else\\". The writing process took 18 months and Boyd was required to run synopses and drafts through the Fleming estate, a process he described as \\"benevolent surveillance\\". The process was not always smooth, and the author had a number of arguments with the estate over the portrayal of Bond: \\"they were concerned about Bond being seen as an assassin, but I would argue Bond is sent on an assassination mission in at least four Fleming books\\", with further issues over Bond's relationship with M. Boyd described writing the book as \\"tremendous fun\\" and a \\"once in a lifetime challenge\\", but admitted that he had to take it \\"really, really seriously.\\" After completing the writing process, Boyd commented that he did not \\"attempt to write a pastiche Fleming novel ... it's my own voice; I'm dealing with things and subjects I am interested in ... it is very much my novel; it just features these characters invented by Fleming.\\" Release and reception Solo was launched on 25 September 2013 at the Dorchester Hotel. Seven copies of the book were signed by Boyd, were collected by seven Jensen Interceptors and were then flown by British Airways to Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Zurich, Los Angeles, Delhi, Cape Town and Sydney. The book was released into the shops on 26 September 2013; the hardcover book was published by Jonathan Cape and was 336 pages long and cost ¬£18.99. An e-book edition was also released, as was an audio book, narrated by Dominic West. The hardcover edition was released in the US by HarperCollins on 8 October 2013 for $26.99. The jacket was designed by Suzanne Dean, the creative director at Random House. The book's dust jacket featured die-cut bullet holes, while the hardcover binding featured \\"burn marks\\" under the holes. Dean commented that she took inspiration from the 1960s in her design, and was influenced by the graphic designers Saul Bass, Paul Rand and Alvin Lustig. Reviews The novel sold nearly 9,000 copies in its first week, although that was 48% down on Deaver's Carte Blanche, and even further behind Sebastian Faulks's 2008 book Devil May Care. By 10 October the London Evening Standard listed the books as number one on the London's Bestsellers list, and in the two weeks of 5 and 12 October 2013 was shown as number 3 in the UK fiction best sellers list, dropping to fourth place on 19 October 2013. Solo received mixed reviews. A number of reviewers, including Robert McCrum in The Guardian, David Mills in The Sunday Times and Olen Steinhauer in The New York Times, all consider the book to be equal with, or superior to, Fleming's stronger novels. Steinhauer writes that it was Boyd's description of the Zanzarim civil war that gave the novel its \\"greatest power\\", and that Boyd performs a \\"neat metafictional trick\\" by connecting Bond's wartime experiences with 30 Assault Unit‚Äîa British Commando unit developed by Fleming. The connection was also picked up by Geoffrey Wansell, reviewing for the Daily Mail, who saw the tribute paid to Fleming as a \\"masterstroke\\", in a novel that he thought \\"brings back the real Bond, triumphantly\\". Writing in The Guardian, Richard Williams saw Boyd using some similar phrasing of Fleming's, while also including \\"gestures of independence\\" with his own ideas. The result, Williams believes, is a story that \\"entertains far more than it exasperates\\". Much of the criticism about the novel focuses on the plot; Jon Stock, writing in The Daily Telegraph, thought that although Boyd used details in the same way Fleming did that would appeal to Bond aficionados, the book was based on \\"a curiously unstirring plot\\", which was also \\"convoluted\\". The Nationals Nick Leech also noted the use of details, but considered that this led to \\"a pedantic, meandering narrative\\" which led to \\"an underwhelming finale\\". Writing in the London Evening Standard, David Sexton agreed, calling the book a \\"rather inattentive novel\\", that was a \\"lame outing\\" in the Bond canon. David Connett was another who saw flaws in the novel, calling it \\"anaemic stuff\\", although it was \\"far superior to the last effort to breathe life into a Bond novel by Jeffery Deaver\\". Adaptations On 30 September 2013 Solo was the chosen work for Book at Bedtime on BBC Radio 4. The work was read by Paterson Joseph; the book was adapted by Libby Spurrier and was broadcast in ten episodes.

Among other books by him were The End of Stupor? (1984), Being Male (1985), The Rage for Utopia (1994) and a memoir, Conway's Way (1988). Career Conway started off in life working in a book store and progressing to electrical fitting in the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War. A native of Melbourne, he was employed as a psychologist by St Vincent's Hospital in that city from 1961 until his retirement. He also maintained a busy private practice at his home in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn, specialising in male difficulties and personal issues. Many of Conway's articles appeared in The Age, The Australian, Quadrant and the now defunct National Times. He had a long-standing association with the National Civic Council (NCC), led by right-wing Catholic activist B. A. Santamaria; at times Santamaria published Conway in the NCC's flagship journal, News Weekly. This association ended when an impassioned censure by Conway of the NCC, particularly concerning the issues of contraception, homosexuality and the parameters of papal infallibility (\\"Mr Santamaria - And Goodbye To All That\\", Quadrant, December 1990), led to a lasting estrangement between the two men. Conway also regretted the 1980s' split in the NCC which saw industrial elements of the organisation ejected. He believed Santamaria to have been the guiding force behind the split. Conway also worked as a consultant for the Melbourne Catholic archdiocese, assessing seminary candidates. His admirers included Tony Abbott, Prime Minister 2013-15 (and Catholic).http://tonyabbott.com.au/LatestNews/ArticleswrittenbyTony/tabid/87/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/7058/RONALD- CONWAY-PHILOSOPHER-OF-HOPE-AND-TRUTH.aspx In his books and essays (as the above-mentioned reference to the Quadrant piece implies) Conway questioned Catholic teaching on sexual matters, allying himself with Freud, with Jung (both Freud and Jung are openly praised in The Great Australian Stupor as great pioneers in the study of the human psyche) and, periodically, with Eastern mysticism. This was chiefly because of Conway's interest in world religions and human belief systems in general. He emphasised the importance of wider human experience as an antidote to the \\"psychophobia\\" present in so many public exchanges. Conway questioned the validity of Catholic teaching on artificial contraception, pointing to the misery of Africa and South America and maintaining that women had the right to regulate the size of their families in an acceptable fashion. He saw contraception as a \\"morally neutral\\" issue that the Church had no reason or right on which to opine. He also believed the church over-emphasised sexual sin above all others, which bemused him. One staunch defence of Freud by Conway was an article published in The Australian on 22 June 1994: \\"Integrity Attack Ignores Fruit of Freud's Genius\\". Conway also praised the psychotherapeutic use of LSD in the 1960s and 1970s, under the guidance of trained practitioners, and was critical of its withdrawal from use in the early 1970s. In his opinion the ban on LSD was caused largely by the questionable professional machinations of Timothy Leary in the US. Conway was also friends with Stanislav Grof, an early pioneer in the use of LSD as an aid in his consulting practice. He never changed his opinion that LSD was the most useful tool available for psychotherapists. Politically, Conway saw himself as an \\"old-time Whig conservative\\" with \\"gnostic\\" leanings and professionally \\"eclectic\\". Others saw him broadly as a neo-Freudian. After the 1996 accession to Melbourne's archiepiscopate of George Pell, Conway grew less prominent in the media, although now and then he wrote for the Sydney Catholic magazine Annals Australasia, and Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper, as well as periodically appearing on television. Conway died at St Vincent's Hospital after suffering from Parkinson's disease and peripheral brain damage. He was farewelled in a Funeral Mass at St Patrick's Cathedral, attended by many prominent friends and former clients. His ashes were then interred at the cemetery in Brighton alongside the remains of his parents. Following his death, accusations that he had sexually interfered with male patients were published by Broken Rites and, in 2019, by The Age.Vedelago, Chris; Tomazin, Farrah; Cuthbertson, Debbie (18 September 2019). \\"\\"'Seduction' of children did little harm, said Catholic gatekeeper\\", The Age.

ATSC 3.0 comprises around 20 standards covering different aspects of the system and in total will have over 1,000 pages of documentation. The standards are designed to offer support for newer technologies, including HEVC for video channels of up to 2160p 4K resolution at 120 frames per second, wide color gamut, high dynamic range, Dolby AC-4 and MPEG-H 3D Audio, datacasting capabilities, and more robust mobile television support. The capabilities have also been foreseen as a way to enable targeted advertising and finer public alerting. The first major deployments of ATSC 3.0 occurred in South Korea, with the country's major television networks launching terrestrial ATSC 3.0 services in May 2017 in preparation for the 2018 Winter Olympics. In November 2017, the United States' Federal Communications Commission approved regulations allowing broadcast stations to voluntarily offer ATSC 3.0 services. If a United States broadcaster elects to begin transmission of ATSC 3.0, they must also broadcast ATSC signals for at least five years thereafter. There is not a mandatory transition or deadline to transition to ATSC 3.0 as existed for the transition from analog NTSC to ATSC. Technical details Bootstrap ATSC 3.0 uses a bootstrap signal which allows a receiver to discover and identify the signals that are being transmitted. The bootstrap signal has a fixed configuration that can allow for new signal types to be used in the future. The bootstrap signal can also carry information to wake up a receiver so that it can receive an emergency alert message. Physical layer ATSC 3.0 uses a physical layer that is based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation with low-density parity-check code (LDPC) FEC codes. With a 6 MHz channel the bit rate can vary from 1 Mbit/s to 57 Mbit/s depending on the parameters that are used. ATSC 3.0 is limited to 4 simultaneous physical layer pipes (PLP) in a channel which may have different robustness levels used for each PLP. An example of how PLP can be used would be a channel that delivers HD video over a robust PLP and enhances the video to UHD with Scalable HEVC Video Coding layer over a higher bitrate PLP. Audio ATSC 3.0 supports Dolby AC-4 and MPEG-H 3D Audio. Video ATSC 3.0 supports three video formats: Legacy SD Video, Interlaced HD Video, and Progressive Video. Legacy SD Video and Interlaced HD Video support frame rates up to 60 fps. Legacy SD Video and Interlaced HD Video are included for compatibility with existing content and can't use HDR, HFR, or WCG. ;Legacy SD Video Legacy SD Video supports resolutions up to 720√ó480 and supports High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Main 10 profile at Level 3.1 Main Tier. ;Interlaced HD Video Interlaced HD Video supports 1080-line interlaced video with 1920 or 1440 pixels per line, and supports HEVC Main 10 profile at Level 4.1 Main Tier. ;Progressive Video Progressive Video supports resolutions up to 3840√ó2160 progressive scan and supports HEVC Main 10 profile at Level 5.2 Main Tier. Progressive Video supports frame rates up to 120 fps and the Rec. 2020 color space. Progressive Video supports HDR using Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) and Perceptual Quantizer (PQ). Watermark ATSC 3.0 supports digital watermarking of the audio signal and video signal.  Public alerting  A U.S. consortium known as AWARN has advocated for the use of ATSC 3.0 features, including datacasting, and automatically waking up devices, in order to provide an emergency alert system with support for embedded rich media and finer geotargeting. These features are defined within the \\"Advanced Emergency Alerting\\" portions of the ATSC 3.0 standards. History On March 26, 2013, the Advanced Television Systems Committee announced a call for proposals for the ATSC 3.0 physical layer which states that the plan is for the system to support video with a resolution of 3840√ó2160 at 60 fps (4K UHDTV). In February 2014, a channel-sharing trial began between Los Angeles television stations KLCS (a public television station that is a PBS member) and KJLA, a commercial ethnic broadcaster owned-and-operated by LATV, with support from the CTIA and approval of the Federal Communications Commission. The test involved multiplexing multiple HD and SD subchannels together, experimenting with both current MPEG-2 / H.262 and MPEG-4 AVC / H.264 video codecs. Ultimately, it has been decided that H.264 would not be considered for ATSC-3.0, but rather the newer MPEG-H HEVC / H.265 codec would be used instead, with OFDM instead of 8VSB for modulation, allowing for 28 Mbit/shttp://mibuzzboard.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t;=40001https://mentor.ieee.org/802.18/dcn/12/18-12-0011-00-0000-nab- presentation-on-atsc-3.pdf to 36 Mbit/shttp://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/88877/kim-luplow-extol- atsc-30-progress/page/3 or more of bandwidth on a single 6-MHz channel. In May 2015, and continuing on for six months afterward, the temporary digital transition transmitter and antenna of Cleveland, Ohio's Fox affiliate, WJW, was used by the National Association of Broadcasters to test the \\"Futurecast\\" ATSC 3.0 standard advanced by LG Corporation and GatesAir. In September 2015 further tests in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area were announced by Sinclair Broadcast Group's Baltimore station, WBFF, which is also a Fox affiliate. The Futurecast system had previously been tested in October 2014 during off-air hours through Madison, Wisconsin ABC affiliate WKOW. Unlike ATSC 1.0/2.0's Distributed Transmission System's pseudo-single-frequency network operations, WI9XXT's two transmitters operate as a true Single Frequency Network.http://atsc.org/newsletter/broadcasters-tech-companies- putting-atsc-3-0-physical-layer-candidate-standard-technologies-through-paces/ Further tests began in on January 6, 2016 of ATSC 3.0 with High Dynamic Range (using the Scalable HEVC video codec with HE-AAC audio) from Las Vegas independent station, KHMP-LD on UHF 18. It would later be joined in these tests by Sinclair's CW affiliate, KVCW simulcasting on a temporary test frequency (UHF 45).http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/live- atsc-30-broadcast-during-ces-2016-delivers-4k-uhd-hdr-to-next-gen-lg- oled-4k-tvs-300199955.htmlhttp://www.avsforum.com/forum/45-local-hdtv-info- reception/148479-las-vegas-nv-hdtv-326.html On January 20, 2016, a working group in South Korea led by LG Electronics and others performed the first \\"end-to-end\\" broadcast of 4K resolution programming via an ATSC 3.0 signal, using an IP transmission from the Seoul Broadcasting System's Mok-dong studio to feed a transmitter on Gwanak Mountain. The broadcaster's technical director stated that the successful test \\"highlights the potential for Korea‚Äôs launch of terrestrial UHD TV commercial services using ATSC 3.0 in February 2017.\\" Following the test broadcast, South Korean broadcasters announced that they planned to launch ATSC 3.0 services in February 2017. On March 28, 2016, the Bootstrap component of ATSC 3.0 (System Discovery and Signalling) was upgraded from candidate standard to finalized standard.http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/first-element-of- atsc-30-approved-for-standard/278263 On June 29, 2016, NBC affiliate WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, a station known for its pioneering roles in testing the original ATSC standards, launched an experimental ATSC 3.0 channel carrying the station's programming in 1080p, as well as a 4K demo loop. WRAL- EX has also carried 4K coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics in an experimental manner. South Korean deployment On July 27, 2016, South Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning officially endorsed ATSC 3.0 as the country's broadcasting standard for ultra-high- definition television. On January 6, 2017, LG Electronics announced that their 2017 4K TVs sold in South Korea would include ATSC 3.0 tuners. On May 31, 2017, SBS, MBC, and KBS officially launched their full-time ATSC 3.0 services in major South Korean markets such as Seoul and Incheon. The launch had been delayed from February 2017 due to issues obtaining the required equipment. The transition made South Korea the first country in the world to deploy a terrestrial UHD format, and enabled 4K broadcasts of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang County. U.S. deployment On February 2, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would allow for the deployment of ATSC 3.0 in the United States. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks comments on issues such as carriage obligations, interference, public interest obligations, simulcasting, and a tuner mandate. Gary Shapiro of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) has stated that a TV tuner mandate is not necessary and that it should be market- driven and voluntary. On February 24, 2017, the FCC voted unanimously to approve two portions of the NPRM, opening the door for manufacturers to begin producing ATSC 3.0 hardware.Deborah D. McAdams, \\"FCC Greenlights ATSC 3.0,\\" TV Technology, February 23, 2017, http://www.tvtechnology.com/atsc3/0031/fcc- greenlights-atsc-30/280420 On November 14, 2017, the Pearl consortium (comprising a number of major broadcasting conglomerates, including Cox Media, Graham Media Group, Hearst Television, Meredith Corporation, Nexstar Media Group, Scripps Media, and Tegna Inc.) announced that it would use Phoenix, Arizona as a test market for an ATSC 3.0 transition in 2018. Two days later, the FCC voted 3‚Äì2 in favor of an order authorizing voluntary deployments of Next Gen TV (ATSC 3.0); stations that choose to deploy ATSC 3.0 services must continue to maintain an ATSC-compatible signal that is \\"substantially similar\\" in programming to their ATSC 3.0 signal (besides programming that leverages ATSC 3.0 features, and advertising), and covers the station's entire community of license (the FCC stated that it would expedite approval for transitions if the loss in over-the-air coverage post-transition is 5% or less). This clause will remain in effect for at least five years; permission from the FCC must be obtained before a full-power station can shut down its ATSC signal, but low- power stations are exempt from the simulcasting requirement and are allowed to flash-cut to ATSC 3.0 if they choose. ATSC 1.0 signals will still be subject to mandatory carriage rules for television providers during the five-year simulcasting mandate; the FCC stated that voluntary carriage of 3.0 signals by television providers would be left to the marketplace. The order does require stations to provide sufficient on-air notice about transitions to ATSC 3.0 services. The FCC will not allocate a second channel to each broadcaster to enable a gradual consumer transition. Instead, it has been suggested that multiple broadcasters in each market cooperate by locating multiple degraded ATSC 1.0 services on a single transmitter. At the same time, the broadcasters would share the remaining transmitters for ATSC 3.0 transmissions. After sufficient consumer adoption, ATSC 1.0 transmissions would be abandoned, allowing stations to return to operation on their owned transmitters. It is unclear how the complications of this approach would be overcome, especially in light of spectrum reallocation in heavily populated markets. The FCC published its final rules on ATSC 3.0 to the Federal Register on February 2, 2018, and they formally took effect 30 days afterward. As the transition is voluntary, the FCC will not require ATSC 3.0 tuners to be included in new televisions, and there will not be a subsidy program for the distribution of ATSC 3.0-compatible equipment. As part of the ATSC 3.0 trials by Pearl, Univision's KFPH-CD in Phoenix was converted to an ATSC 3.0 station on April 9, 2018, which will be shared by Univision and several other broadcasters. Univision and Sinclair Broadcast Group are also planning a trial in Dallas, which will utilize spectrum vacated by KSTR-DT and KTXD-TV to test ATSC 3.0 transmission using a single-frequency network. The major network affiliates in Las Vegas became the first to launch permanent ATSC 3.0 signals on May 26, 2020.  Concerns  Consumer advocates have noted the opportunity in which ATSC 3.0 can allow advertisers to run targeted advertising. The targeted ads would allow advertisers to track more directly viewer ratings rather than indirectly by companies such as Nielsen ratings. The FCC is expected to defer the decision on targeted ads to be in accordance with Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on privacy. A consortium of U.S. television providers criticized the domestic plans for the transition, citing the \\"voluntary\\" transition, inconsistencies in commitments to simulcasting arrangements for compatibility, potential downgrades in service for ATSC 1.0 viewers, as well as how these signals will factor into retransmission consent negotiations.

The sisters set up a convent on a piece of land given to them by John Hardman of Hardman & Co. who lived opposite. He promised to bear all the expenses of creating a convent, and helped by an endowment of ¬£2000 from the Earl of Shrewsbury he commissioned Augustus Pugin to design the building for them. The chapel of the convent, dedicated to Saint Mary served as the parish church until 1847.British Listed Buildings retrieved 13 April 2013Slevin, Malachy St Francis Church Handsworth (Birmingham, 1994) pp.1-17 St Mary's Church In 1845, with the local Catholic population increasing, it was decided that a larger church would have to be built. So building work started on a separate church that was located next door to the convent. In July 1847, St Mary's Church was opened and consecrated by Bishop William Wareing. In 1882, a new priest, Fr Francis Hopkins joined the parish. He saw that the new church could not accommodate the increasingly numerous congregation, so he made it his priority to start the construction of a new church. St Francis of Assisi Church Land for the new church was bought from the Hardman family opposite the convent and the Hardman family house became the presbytery of the new church. The architect chosen to design the church was Canon Alexander Scoles. He was a priest from the Diocese of Clifton and came from a family of architects. His father was Joseph John Scoles, who designed the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Farm Street, London and his brother was Ignatius Scoles who designed St Wilfrid's Church in Preston, Lancashire. Four years later, Canon Scoles went on to design Our Lady of Loreto and St Winefride's Church in Kew, London. The foundation stone of St Francis' church was laid in May 1893 by Bishop Edward Ilsley. The church was completed a year later and was opened by Cardinal Herbert Vaughan on 2 February 1894. When the debt from the cost of the building, ¬£9000 was paid off five years later, the church was consecrated on 21 June 1900. Interior With the Hardman family being so prominent in the founding and construction of the church, it is unsurprising that a lot of the interior work was done by Hardman & Co. All of the stained glass windows were made by the company. One window depicting the Annunciation adjacent to the Lady chapel was designed by William John Wainwright and then built by Hardman & Co. The altar and reredos was made from a drawing done by the architect, Alexander Scoles.

It houses a large hall, a stage, kitchen and offices. The church was refurbished in the 1980s by Monsignor Thomas Fallon. It meant that the sanctuary was changed, bringing it in line with the decrees of the Second Vatican Council. The church has five Masses for Sundays. There's a Mass at 7pm on Saturday evening, 9:30 and 11:30 on Sunday morning, a Vietnamese language Mass at 1:30pm and a Sunday evening Mass at 6.30pm. The church also has weekday morning Masses at 9:15am. There is an adoration chapel next door to the church that can also be used for prayer.

Author Kirsch is Associate Director of the Program in Placebo Studies and a lecturer in medicine at the Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and professor emeritus of psychology at the Universities of Hull and Plymouth in the United Kingdom, and the University of Connecticut in the United States. His research interests include placebo effects, antidepressants, expectancy, and hypnosis. He is the originator of response expectancy theory. Argument While analyzing antidepressant trials as part of his research into the placebo effect, Kirsch realised that drug companies do not publish all of their disappointing antidepressant trial results, but most decisions about the efficacy of an antidepressant are based only on published results. Using the Freedom of Information Act, he and his colleagues acquired from the US Food and Drug Administration the unpublished trial results for six antidepressants. When the results from both published and unpublished studies were averaged, the researchers concluded that the drugs produced a small but clinically meaningless improvement in mood compared with an inert placebo (sugar pill). (Some researchers have questioned the statistical basis of this study suggesting that it underestimates the effect size of antidepressants and other studies have reached a range of supporting and conflicting conclusions). To determine whether their averaging of results was hiding a meaningful benefit to more-severely depressed patients by combining their results with those of moderately and mildly depressed patients, he and his colleagues undertook another study, this time of the four new-generation antidepressants for which all (published and unpublished) trial data were available, and concluded that the difference between drug and placebo effect was greater for more-severely depressed patients, and that this difference was clinically meaningful (but still relatively small) only at the upper end of the very severely depressed category. They attributed this difference to very seriously depressed patients being less responsive to the inert placebo. Kirsch also addresses the conclusions of the a 2004 study, that if one antidepressant doesn't work on a patient, another should be tried in its place, and then another, until hopefully one will be found to be effective. The 2004 study found that although only 37% of patients were helped by the first antidepressant tried, 67% had found some relief by the time they had tried the fourth. Kirsch cites a 1957 study in which volunteers were given a drug that induces nausea and one to treat nausea. If the anti-nausea drug failed to prevent nausea, they were given another. If that failed, another was tried; and so on. All volunteers experienced complete relief from nausea by the sixth treatment, yet every treatment was a placebo. He concludes that the results of the 2004 antidepressant study are also likely due to the placebo effect. Since the chemical-imbalance theory of depression is based on the efficacy of antidepressants, Kirsch concludes, \\"It now seems beyond question that the traditional account of depression as a chemical imbalance in the brain is simply wrong.\\" Reception and impact The European Psychiatric Association published a position paper in 2012 that described Kirsch's argument as \\"misleading\\". The organization argues that * The mathematical treatment of the data was flawed and underestimates the efficacy of antidepressants; * The analysis incorrectly focuses on mean differences between groups and ignores important subgroup effects; * The size effect cutoff of 0.50 is arbitrary and not demonstrated to be clinically meaningful; * That efficacy measured by the 15-20% difference between placebo and active antidepressant treatment in rate of remission corresponds to moderate to strong efficacy in evidence-based medicine analyses, and * Kirsch's analysis disregards the results of double-blind, placebo controlled maintenance studies that show highly statistical effects on the rate of relapse for those treated with antidepressants relative to those receiving placebo Marcia Angell's review of The Emperor's New Drugs welcomes Kirsch's work as a long overdue application of the scientific method to a field lacking rigorous scientific analysis, stating \\"Kirsch is a faithful proponent of the scientific method, and his voice therefore brings a welcome objectivity to a subject often swayed by anecdotes, emotions, or, as we will see, self-interest.\\" Psychiatrist Daniel Carlat called the book \\"an important book, with the reservation that Kirsch‚Äôs selective use of data gives him the appearance of an anti- antidepressant partisan.\\" He states that Irving's conclusions are \\"provocative but unconvincing\\", noting that many drugs such as benzodiazepines have been tested for antidepressant activity and found inactive. Carlat argues that if antidepressants were acting purely via a placebo effect, any benzodiazepines and other drugs would show activity as well. In a 2012 episode of CBS's 60 Minutes featuring Kirsch and his book, host Lesley Stahl said, \\"The medical community is at war ‚Äì battling over the scientific research and writings of a psychologist named Irving Kirsch ... Kirsch and his studies have triggered a furious counterattack, mainly from psychiatrists.\\" After the program's airing, Jeffrey Lieberman, the American Psychiatric Association's president elect at the time, said, \\"Dr. Kirsch is mistaken and confused, and he's ideologically biased in his thinking. He is conducting an analysis and interpreting the data to support his ideologically biased perspective. What he is concluding is inaccurate, and what he is communicating is misleading to people and potentially harmful to those who really suffer from depression and would be expected to benefit from antidepressant medication. To say that antidepressants are no better than placebo is just plain wrong.\\" Reviews in the lay press have been largely positive,Lay press: * David Small (2009) Times Higher Education Supplement \\"The Pills Work if You're a Believer\\" * Sharon Begley (2010) Newsweek \\"The Depressing News About Antidepressants\\" * Louis Menand (2010) The New Yorker \\"Head Case: Can Psychiatry be a Science?\\" * James Le Fanu (2010) Literary Review \\"Prozac Blues\\" * Carlin Flora (2010) Discover Psychologist Says Antidepressants Are Just Fancy Placebos * Marcia Angell (2011) New York Review of Books \\"The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why?\\" * Peter Kramer (2011) The New York Times Sunday Review \\"In Defense of Antidepressants\\"Scientific press: * Liz Else (2009) New Scientist \\"Review: The Emperor's New Drugs and Doctoring the Mind\\" * Neil Richardson (2010) British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy \\"Book review\\" * Robert Whitaker (2010) Psychology Today \\"Mad in America\\" * Nicole Brenan (2010) Scientific American \\"MIND Reviews: The Emperor's New Drugs\\" * Robert Whitaker (2011) American Journal of Psychology \\"The Emperor's Turn to Blush\\" * Melvyn A.

Counsel for the applicant was CJ Hartzenberg SC (with him M G Roberts); DA Gordon SC appeared for the respondents. The applicant's attorney was the State Attorney; the respondents' attorneys were Venn, Nemeth & Hart. The matter dealt with the question of atmospheric pollution: in particular, the carrying on of a \\"scheduled process\\" within a controlled area in contravention of section 9(1) of Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act.Act 45 of 1965. The court found that the remedy of interdict was available to enforce the provisions of this Act, so that the Minister of Health and Welfare was not limited to the remedy of criminal prosecution. The Minister of Health and Welfare was responsible for the proper administration and enforcement of the Act. The purpose of provisions of sections 9 to 13 was to \\"control\\" the installation and use of \\"scheduled processes\\" throughout South Africa. The court found that the Minister needed the remedy of interdict for that purpose, and accordingly had locus standi to apply for such an interdict. Because none of the respondent's neighbours were applicants in such proceedings, Minister also had locus standi to apply for an interdict restraining such conduct of the respondent which infringed the right to \\"an environment which is not detrimental to their health and well-being,\\" as enshrined in section 29 of the interim Constitution, then in effect. The generation of smoke, in contravention of s 9(1) of Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act 45 of 1965, was just such an infringement.  Judgment  The Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act, the court found, does authorise the Minister of Health and Welfare to apply for an interdict to enforce the provisions of section 9(1) thereof, and to restrain conduct which constitutes the carrying on of a \\"scheduled process\\" within a controlled area without a current registration certificate, in contravention of section 9(1). The Minister is not limited, therefore, to the specific criminal penalties provided for contraventions of section 9. The Act provides no specific \\"remedies\\" which the Minister or any other interested party can invoke to stop a person from contravening it. In such circumstances the principle does not arise that the Act is exclusive as to what may be done to enforce its provisions.161D-F, 159H-I. The dictum in Johannesburg City Council v Knoetze and Sons1969 (2) SA 148 (W) 154F-155B. was thus approved and applied. The Minister of Health and Welfare is responsible for the proper administration and enforcement of the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act. The whole purpose of the legislation, and particularly of the provisions of sections 9-13 of the Act, is to \\"control\\" the installation and use of scheduled processes throughout the Republic, seeing that the whole of the Republic has been designated as a \\"controlled area.\\" It cannot, in these circumstances, be contended that the Minister does not need the remedy of injunction to enable her to control these processes effectively and thereby discharge her duties under the Act. Accordingly, the court found, the Minister has locus standi to apply for an interdict to restrain conduct which constitutes a contravention of section 9(1) of the Act.161I-162A. Conduct which is unlawful in the light of section 9 of the Act, in casu the generation of smoke producing noxious or offensive gases at the respondents' sawmill by means of a scheduled process, was found also to be an infringement of the rights of the respondents' neighbours to \\"an environment which is not detrimental to their health and well-being,\\" enshrined for them in section 29 of the interim Constitution. Insofar as none of those neighbours were applicants for an interdict restraining such infringement, the Minister of Health and Welfare could rely on the provisions of section 7(4)(b)(iv) of the Constitution for locus standi to apply to Court for an interdict to restrain conduct which infringes the rights under section 29 of the neighbours of such respondent.164E-G.

Early life Philip Sutton was born in Poole, Dorset, in 1928 but grew up in Leyton, east London. After leaving school at the age of 14, he worked in a drawing office before carrying out three years' National Service, during which he was involved in the Berlin Airlift. Life and career After leaving the RAF, Sutton used the ex- serviceman's grant scheme to gain a place at the Slade School of Fine Art in 1949, and in 1952 won the Slade Summer Composition Prize. At the school's degree show in 1953, Slade professor William Coldstream introduced Sutton's work to art dealers Henry Roland and Gustave Delbanco. That same year he married Heather Cooke, then travelled on scholarships to Spain, France and Italy. During their time in Europe the couple had a son named Jake. On his return to London he began teaching at the Slade School, where he remained for the next nine years. Around this time he made his first sale via a commercial gallery to tenor Peter Pears. The painting sold was a portrait of fellow Slade student Tony Tice. After discussing Sutton's circumstances with Gustave Delbanco, Pears invited Sutton to lunch with Pears' associate, composer Benjamin Britten. The pair offered Sutton and his family the use of Joy Cottage in Snape, Suffolk where the family stayed for three years (between 1955 and 1958), though this did not prevent his being elected to the London Group in 1956. Two more children were born during the family's time in Suffolk‚Äîa period during which Sutton's style as a painter matured as he abandoned abstractism and adopted more subtle colours. Returning to London in 1958, Sutton held his first solo exhibition at the Roland, Browse and Delbanco Gallery, also the venue for many later exhibitions throughout the 1960s and 1970s. It was in these two decades that his work became fashionable. In 1977 Sutton was elected as an Associate Royal Academician, his works were included in an exhibition at the Royal Academy, and he was the subject of a BBC Arena programme. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Sutton turned his hand to design, creating a poster and banner for the 1979 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, a tapestry for Shell in 1984, and the logo for Investors in Industry the following year. This area extended to include ceramics - a wall of tiles for NMB Bank, Amsterdam - posters for London Transporthttp://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/artist/artist.html?IXartist=Philip+Sutton,and postage stamps for Royal Mail.http://www.collectgbstamps.co.uk/explore/years/?year=1989 On 8 December 1988 he was elected as a Royal Academician. A collection of his woodcuts from the 1950s to the 1970s was published in 1998, and a biography and collection of his work followed ten years later. He has continued to paint into his nineties despite having lost sight in one eye, and lives and works in West Bay, Dorset.

Two of them have been the subject of vandalistic attacks in museums. The series' name was a reference to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the 1962 play by Edward Albee, which was in itself a reference to \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\\", the 1933 song immortalized in Disney cartoons. Barnett Newman started the first painting in the series without a preconceived notion of the subject or end result; he only wanted it to be different from what he had done until then, and to be asymmetrical. But after having painted the canvas red, he was confronted with the fact that only the other primary colours yellow and blue would work with it; this led to an inherent confrontation with the works of De Stijl and especially Piet Mondriaan, who had in the opinion of Newman turned the combination of the three colors into a didactic idea instead of a means of expression in freedom. Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue I This 1966 oil on canvas measures 190 by 122 cm, making it the smallest of the four. It was dedicated to Jasper Johns. It was the subject of a 2006 installation by Robert Irwin at the Pace Gallery, and also the centerpiece of the 2007 exhibition Who's afraid of red, yellow and blue?: Positionen der Farbfeldmalerei in the Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden. It is held in a private collection. Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue II Who‚Äôs Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue II This 1967 acrylic on canvas painting is part of the collection of the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. It measures approximately 305 x 259 cm. Philip Taaffe's 1985 We Are Not Afraid is openly acknowledged as a reply and tribute to Newman's paintings, especially Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue II, matching the basic layout and even the dimensions Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue III Who‚Äôs Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue III Measuring 224 by 544 cm, this 1967 painting is part of the collection of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. It was attacked with a knife by Gerard Jan van Bladeren in 1986 and restored by Daniel Goldreyer in 1991. The restoration initially cost some $400,000, but was heavily attacked by critics who claimed that subtle nuances in the three monochrome sections had been lost and that Goldreyer had used house paints and a roller. According to critics, the painting had been destroyed twice: first during the attack, and again during the restoration. Goldreyer filed a $125 million suit against the City of Amsterdam and the Museum, claiming that his reputation was damaged. After lawsuits, settlements, and further restoration, the final cost of the attack was estimated to be close to $1 million. The Amsterdam city council asked for a full forensic report on the controversial restoration. When the report was finished, the City of Amsterdam and Goldreyer agreed to keep it under wraps, as part of a settlement. But almost 20 years later, on 11 September 2013, the Raad van State decided the report had to be made public by the Government of Amsterdam within six weeks. A week later the Volkskrant newspaper published the report's main conclusions. It confirmed that Goldreyer had indeed repainted the entire red section with acrylic paint and had used a roller to add two layers of varnish to the, initially unvarnished, painting. According to the newspaper, Goldreyer's restoration has \\"forever destroyed\\" Newman's work. The painting was put on display again in the Stedelijk Museum in 2014. Wim Beeren, director of the Stedelijk Museum at the time of the 1986 attack, revealed in an interview that van Bladeren was not pleased with the restoration and called the museum to warn his successor Rudi Fuchs of a second attack. Van Bladeren entered the museum for a second time in 1997 to make good on his intentions to deface Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue III but was not able to locate the painting. He instead opted to attack a different Barnett Newman painting called Cathedra, which he slashed in a similar fashion to his first attack. Beeren recalled that the painting, not on display at the time, was in a storage facility. Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue IV Who‚Äôs Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue IV Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue IV was created in 1969‚Äì1970 and is the last major work by Barnett Newman. The oil on canvas painting measures 274 by 603 cm. It belongs to the collection of the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, who bought it in 1982 from Newman's widow for 2.7 million Deutschmark (roughly 1 million US dollars), partially with funds raised by the public. It was attacked on April 13, 1982, days before it would be presented to the public, by Josef Nikolaus Kleer, a 29-year-old student who claimed that the picture was a \\"perversion of the German flag\\" (the painting has vertical bands of red, yellow and blue, while the German flag has horizontal stripes in black, red and yellow), and that his actions completed the work, a reference to the title of the painting. The restoration took two years.

Bauman (2005), Crime and Punishment in Ancient Rome, London & New York: Routledge, reprint of 1996 edition, , p. 23. under Roman law was a type of death penalty imposed on a subject who had been found guilty of parricide. The punishment consisted of being sewn up in a leather sack, with an assortment of live animals including a dog, snake, monkey, and a chicken or rooster, and then being thrown into water. The punishment may have varied widely in its frequency and precise form during the Roman period. For example, the earliest fully documented case is from ca. 100 BC, although scholars think the punishment may have developed about a century earlier. Inclusion of live animals in the sack is only documented from Early Imperial times, and at the beginning, only snakes were mentioned. At the time of Emperor Hadrian (2nd century AD), the most well known form of the punishment was documented, where a cock, a dog, a monkey and a viper were inserted in the sack. At the time of Hadrian poena cullei was made into an optional form of punishment for parricides (the alternative was being thrown to the beasts in the arena). During the 3rd century AD up to the accession of Emperor Constantine, poena cullei fell out of use; Constantine revived it, now with only serpents to be added in the sack. Well over 200 years later, Emperor Justinian reinstituted the punishment with the four animals, and poena cullei remained the statutory penalty for parricides within Byzantine law for the next 400 years, when it was replaced with being burned alive. Poena cullei gained a revival of sorts in late medieval and early modern Germany, with late cases of being drowned in a sack along with live animals being documented from Saxony in the first half of the 18th century. Execution ritual The 19th-century historian Theodor Mommsen compiled and described in detail the various elements that at one time or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.Mommsen (1899), pp. 921‚Äì923 The person was first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis (\\"blood-colored rods\\", probablySee, in particular, Watson, Robinson (1998), p.336 and for example, \\"blood-red rods\\" in Gaughan (2010), p.85), and his head was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an assortment of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water. Other variations occur, and some of the Latin phrases have been interpreted differently. For example, in his early work De Inventione, Cicero says the criminal's mouth was covered by a leather bag, rather than a wolf's hide. He also says the person was held in prison until the large sack was made ready, whereas at least one modern author believes the sack, culleus, involved, would have been one of the large, very common sacks Romans transported wine in, so that such a sack would have been readily available. According to the same author, such a wine sack had a volume of .Cicero, Yonge (1852), p.369 and, on wine sack, Francesce (2007), pp. 184‚Äì185 Another point of contention concerns precisely how, and by what means, the individual was beaten. In his 1920 essay \\"The Lex Pompeia and the Poena Cullei\\", Max Radin observes that, as expiation, convicts were typically flogged until they bled (some commentators translate the phrase as \\"beaten with rods till he bleeds\\"), but that it might very well be the case that the rods themselves were painted red. Radin also points to a third option, namely that the \\"rods\\" actually were some type of shrub, since it documented from other sources that whipping with some kinds of shrub was thought to be purifying in nature.Radin (1920), p.119 Publicius Malleolus The picture gained of the ritual above is compiled from sources ranging in their generally agreed upon dates of composition from the 1st century BC, to the 6th century AD, that is, over a period of six to seven hundred years. Different elements are mentioned in the various sources, so that the actual execution ritual at any one particular time may have been substantially distinct from that ritual performed at other times. For example, the Rhetoricia ad Herennium, a treatise by an unknown author from about 90 BC details the execution of a Publicius Malleolus, found guilty of murdering his own mother, along with citing the relevant law as follows: As can be seen from the above, in this early reference, no mention is made of live animals as co-inhabitants within the sack, nor is the mention of any initial whipping contained, nor that Malleolus, contained within the sack, was transported to the river in a cart driven by black oxen. The Roman historian Livy places the execution of Malleolus to just about 10 years earlier than the composition of Rhetoricia ad Herennium (i.e., roughly 100 BC) and claims, furthermore, that Malleolus was the first in Roman history who was convicted to be sewn into a sack and thrown into the water, on account of parricide.Livy, Baker (1797), p.338 Possible antecedents The historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Valerius Maximus,working primarily under emperors Augustus (r. 27 BCE ‚Äì 14 AD) and Tiberius (r. 14 ‚Äì 37 AD), respectively connect the practice of poena cullei with an alleged incident under king Tarquinius Superbus (legendary reign being 535‚Äì509 BC). During his reign, the Roman state apparently acquired the so- called Sibylline Oracles, books of prophecy and sacred rituals. The king appointed a couple of priests, the so-called Duumviri sacrorum, to guard the books, but one of them, Marcus Atilius, was bribed, and in consequence, divulged some of the book's secrets (to a certain Sabine foreigner Petronius, according to Valerius). For that breach of religion, Tarquinius had him sewn up in a sack and thrown into the sea. According to Valerius Maximus, it was very long after this event that this punishment was instituted for the crime of parricide as well, whereas Dionysius says that in addition to being suspected of divulging the secret texts, Atilius was, indeed, accused of having killed his own father.Valerius, Walker (2004), p.6 and Dionysius, Spelman (1758), p.262 The Greek historian Plutarch, however, in his \\"Life of Romulus\\" claims that the first case in Roman history of a son killing his own father happened more than five centuries after the foundation of Rome (traditional foundation date 753 BC), when a man called Lucius Hostius murdered his own father after the wars with Hannibal, that is, after the Second Punic War (which ended in 201 BC). Plutarch, however, does not specify how Lucius Hostius was executed, or even if he was executed by the Roman state at all. Additionally, he notes that at the time of Romulus and for the first centuries onwards, \\"parricide\\" was regarded as roughly synonymous with what is now called homicide, and that prior to the times of Luicus Hostius, the murder of one's own father, (i.e., patricide), was simply morally \\"unthinkable\\".Plutarch, Dryden (2008), p.55 According to Cloud and other modern scholars of Roman classical antiquity, a fundamental shift in the punishment of murderers may have occurred towards the end of the 3rd century BC, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the 2nd century BC and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than giving the offended family full licence to mete out what they deemed appropriate punishment to the murderer of a relative.For this shift, see for example, Lintott (1999), p.38 Within that particular context, Cloud points out that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read as referring to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides specifically (without the animals being involved).See footnote 86 reference to Cloud in Robinson (2007), p.45 Yet another incident prior to the execution of Malleolus is relevant. Some 30 years before the times of Malleolus, in the upheavals and riotings caused by the reform program urged on by Tiberius Gracchus, a man called Caius Villius, an ally of Gracchus, was condemned on some charge, and was shut up in a vessel or jar, to which serpents were added, and he was killed in that manner.Plutarch, Stadter (1999), p.99 First-century BC legislation Two laws documented from the first century BC are principally relevant to Roman murder legislation in general, and legislation on parricide in particular. These are the Lex Cornelia De Sicariis, promulgated in the 80s BC, and the Lex Pompeia de Parricidiis promulgated about 55 BC. According to a 19th-century commentator, the relation between these two old laws might have been that it was the Lex Pompeia that specified the poena cullei (i.e., sewing the convict up in a sack and throwing him in the water) as the particular punishment for a parricide, because a direct reference to the Lex Cornelia shows that the typical punishment for a poisoner or assassin in general (rather than for the specific crime of parricide) was that of banishment, i.e., Lex Pompeia makes explicit distinctions for the crime of parricide not present in Lex Cornelia.Long (1855), p.55 Support for a possible distinction in the inferred contents of Lex Cornelia and Lex Pompeia from the remaining primary source material may be found in comments by the 3rd-century AD jurist Aelius Marcianus, as preserved in the 6th-century collection of juristical sayings, the Digest: Modern experts continue to have some disagreements as to the actual meaning of the offence called \\"parricide\\", on the precise relation between the Lex Cornelia and the Lex Pompeia generally, and on the practice and form of the poena cullei specifically. For example, Kyle (2012) summarizes, in a footnote, one of the contemporary relevant controversies in the following manner: Writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero Marcus Tullius Cicero, the renowned lawyer, orator and politician from the 1st century BC, provides in his copious writings several references to the punishment of poena cullei, but none of the live animals documented within the writings by others from later periods. In his defence speech of 80 BC for Sextus Roscius (accused of having murdered his own father), he expounds on the symbolic importance of the punishment as follows, for example, as Cicero believed it was devised and designed by the previous Roman generations: That the practice of sewing murderers of their parents in sacks and throwing them in the water was still an active type of punishment at Cicero's time, at least on the provincial level, is made clear within a preserved letter Marcus wrote to his own brother Quintus, who as governor in Asia Minor in the 50s BC had, in fact, meted out that precise punishment to two locals in Smyrna, as Marcus observes.Cicero, Watson (1871), p.24 Julio-Claudian Dynasty, the two Senecas and Juvenal In whatever form or frequency the punishment of the sack was actually practiced in late Republican Rome or early Imperial Rome, the historian Suetonius, in his biography of Octavian, that is Emperor Augustus (r.27 BC‚Äì14 AD), notes the following reluctance on the emperor's part to actively authorize, and effect, that dread penalty: Quite the opposite mentality seems to have been the case with Emperor Claudius (r.41 ‚Äì 54 AD) For example, Emperor Nero's mentor, Seneca the Younger sighed about the times of Claudius as follows: It is also with a writer like Seneca that serpents are mentioned in context with the punishment;.But, serpents only, cf. Robinson (2007), footnote 91, p.46 Even before Seneca the Younger, his father, Seneca the Elder, who lived in the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius and Caligula, indicates in a comment that snakes would be put in the culleus: The rather later satirist Juvenal (born, probably, in the 50s AD) also provides evidence for the monkey, he even pities the monkey, at one point, as an innocent sufferer.Satire 13, \\"Or those, who in a raw ox-hide are bound, And, with an ill-starr'd ape, poor sufferer! drown'd?\\", in Juvenal, Gifford, Nuttall (1836), p.152 Not so with how Emperor Nero was reviled. In one play, Juvenal suggests that for Nero, being put in merely one sack is not good enough.\\"Nero, for whose chastisement no single ape or adder, no solitary sack, should have been provided\\" Satire 8, cited in Kahn (2005), p.85 This might, for example, be a reference both to the death of Nero's mother Agrippina Minor, widely believed to have been murdered on Nero's orders, and also to how Nero murdered his fatherland.On this interpretation, see Varner (2004), p.47 Not only Juvenal thought the sack was the standard by which the appropriate punishment for Nero should be measured; the statues of Nero were despoiled and vandalized, and according to the Roman historian Suetonius, one statue was draped in a sack given a placard that said \\"I have done what I could. But you deserve the sack!\\".Suetonius reference in Elliott, Reasoner (2011), pp. 152‚Äì153 Emperor Hadrian and later jurists It is within the law collection Digest 48.9.9 that perhaps the most famous formulation of the poena cullei is retained, from the sayings of the mid-3rd- century CE jurist Modestinus. In Olivia Robinsons translation, it reads: Thus, it is seen in the time of Emperor Hadrian (r.117‚Äì138 CE), the punishment for parricide was basically made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead. Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in the 4th-century CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that the cart with the sack and its live contents was driven by black oxen. In the time of the late 3rd-century CE jurist Paulus, he said that the poena cullei had fallen out of use, and that parricides were either burnt alive or thrown to the beasts instead.On Dositheus and Paulus references, see Mommsen (1899), footnotes at p.922 and p.923, respectively However, although Paulus regards the punishment of poena cullei as obsolete in his day, the church father Eusebius, in his \\"Martyrs of Palestine\\" notes a case of a Christian man Ulpianus in Tyre who was \\"cruelly scourged\\" and then placed in a raw ox-hide, together with a dog and a venomous serpent and cast in the sea.Eusebius, Cureton (1861), pp. 59‚Äì60 The incident is said to have taken place in 304 CE.On feast day and date of martyrdom, Who was a Christian in the Holy Land? Revival by Constantine the Great On account of Paulus' comment, several scholars thinkThat is, for example, the view of Mommsen. A more modern historian, Connie Scarborough, notes that at the times of Paulus, parricides were generally burnt, and that the particular punishment of poena cullei was certainly obsolete at the tom of Constantine's accession. Scarborough, Classen, Scarborough (2012), p.229 the punishment of poena cuelli fell out of use in the 3rd century CE, but the punishment was revived, and made broader (by including fathers who killed their children as liable to the punishment) by Emperor Constantine in a rescript from 318 CE. This rescript was retained in the 6th-century Codex Justinianus and reads as follows: Legislation of Justinian The Corpus Juris Civilis, the name for the massive body of law promulgated by Emperor Justinian from the 530s CE and onwards, consists of two historical collections of laws and their interpretation (the Digest, opinions of the pre-eminent lawyers from the past, and the Codex Justinianus, a collection of edicts and rescripts by earlier emperors), along with Justinian's prefatory introduction text for students of Law, Institutes, plus the Novels, Justinian's own, later edicts. That the earlier collections were meant to be sources for the actual, current practice of law, rather than just being of historical interest, can be seen, for example, from the inclusion, and modification of Modestinus' famous description of poena cullei (Digest 48.9.9), in Justinian's own law text in Institutes 4.18.6. It is seen that Justinian regards this as a novel enactment of an old law, and that he includes not only the symbolic interpretations of the punishment as found in for example Cicero, but also Constantine's extension of the penalty to fathers who murder their own children. In Justinian, relative to Constantine, we see the inclusion in the sack of the dog, cock and monkey, not just the serpent(s) in Constantine. Some modern historians, such as O.F. Robinson, suspects that the precise wording of the text in the Institutes 4.18.6 suggests that the claimed reference in Digest 48.9.9 from Modestinus is actually a sixth CE interpolation into the 3rd-century CE law text, rather than being a faithful citation of Modestinus.Robinson (2007), footnote 100, p.46 Abolition The poena cullei was eliminated as the punishment for parricides within the Byzantine Empire in the law code Basilika, promulgated more than 300 years after the times of Justinian, around 892 CE. As Margaret Trenchard-Smith notes, however, in her essay \\"Insanity, Exculpation and Disempowerment\\", that \\"this does not necessarily denote a softening of attitude. According to the Synopsis Basilicorum (an abridged edition of Basilika), parricides are to be cast into the flames.\\"Trenchard-Smith, Turner (2010), p.48 German revival in the Middle Ages and beyond The penalty of the sack, with the animals included, experienced a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th-century commentator on the 13th- century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch,Johann von Buch for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with a painting of a serpent on a piece of paper and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.B√∂hmer (1820), p. 377‚Äì378 The difference between using linen, rather than leather is that linen soaks easily, and the inhabitants will drown, whereas a watertight leather sack will effect death by suffocation due to lack of air (or death by a drawn-out drowning process, relative to a comparatively quick one), rather than death by drowning. In a 1548 case from Dresden, the intention was to suffocate the culprit (who had killed his mother), rather than drown him. With him into the leather sack was a cat and a dog, and the sack was made airtight by coating it with pitch. However, the sack chosen was too small, and had been overstretched, so as the sack hit the waters after being thrown from the bridge, it ripped open. The cat and the dog managed to swim away and survive, while the criminal (presumably bound) \\"got his punishment rather earlier than had been the intention\\", that is, death by drowning instead.Original story in Weck (1680), p.482 The last case where this punishment is, by some, alleged to have been meted out in 1734, somewhere in Saxony.See, for assertion of 1734 as last case, Auler (2012), p.453 The standard reference to the 1734 case is Grimm (1828), p.697, but Grimm merely says there happened a case in 1734, not that it was the last one. Another tradition, however, is evidenced from the Saxonian city Zittau, where the last case is alleged to have happened in 1749. In at least one case in Zittau 1712, a non-venomous colubrid snake was used. The Zittau ritual was to put the victims in a black sack, and keep it under water for no less than six hours. In the meantime, the choir boys in town had the duty to sing the Psalm composed by Martin Luther, \\"Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir\\" (From deep affliction I cry out to you).Pescheck (1837), p.189 According to Pescheck at that page, as many as 6 cases of sacking are recorded in Zittau in the 18th century: in 1712, 1713, 1714, 1718, 1726 and 1749 The punishment of the sack was expressly abolished in Saxony in a rescript dated 17 June 1761B√∂hmer (1820), p. 377‚Äì378 Original rescript by Prince Elector Friedrich August in Weiske (1833), p.98 From Chinese accounts The Wenxian Tongkao, written by Chinese historian Ma Duanlin (1245-1322), and the History of Song describe how the Byzantine emperor Michael VII Parapinakƒìs Caesar (Mie li sha ling kai sa ÊªÖÂäõÊ≤ôÈùàÊîπÊíí) of Fu lin (ÊãÇËèª, i.e. Byzantium) sent an embassy to China's Song dynasty, arriving in November 1081, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067-1085). The History of Song described the tributary gifts given by the Byzantine embassy as well as the products made in Byzantium. It also described forms of punishment in Byzantine law, such as caning, as well as the capital punishment of being stuffed into a \\"feather bag\\" and thrown into the sea. This description seems to correspond with the Romano-Byzantine punishment of poena cullei. Modern fiction In his (1991) novel Roman Blood, Steven Saylor renders a fictionalized, yet informed, rendition of how the Roman punishment poena cullei might occur. The reference to the punishment is in connection with Cicero's (historically correct, and successful) endeavours to acquit Sextus Roscius of the charge of having murdered his own father.

Many issues stem from the subjugation of Native Americans in society, including societal discrimination, racism, cultural appropriation through sports mascots, and depictions in art. Native Americans have also been subject to substantial historical and intergenerational trauma that have resulted in significant public health issues like alcoholism and risk of suicide. Demographics Poldine Carlo, author of Nulato: An Indian life on the Yukon, a Koyukon writer from Alaska A little over one third of the 2,786,652 Native Americans in the United States live in three states: California at 413,382, Arizona at 294,137 and Oklahoma at 279,559. 70% of Native Americans lived in urban areas in 2012, up from 45% in 1970 and 8% in 1940. Many Urban Indians live in cities due to forced relocation by the United States government with legislative pieces such as the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 or due to the need for healthcare services not provided on or near reservations and tribe locations. In the early 21st century, Native American communities have exhibited continual growth and revival, playing a larger role in the American economy and in the lives of Native Americans. Communities have consistently formed governments that administer services such as firefighting, natural resource management, social programs, health care, housing and law enforcement. Numerous tribes have founded tribal colleges. Most Native American communities have established court systems to adjudicate matters related to local ordinances. Most also look to various forms of moral and social authority, such as forms of restorative justice, vested in the traditional culture of the tribal nation. Native American professionals have founded associations in journalism, law, medicine and other fields to encourage students in these fields, provide professional training and networking opportunities, and entry into mainstream institutions. To address the housing needs of Native Americans, Congress passed the Native American Housing and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA) in 1996. This legislation replaced public housing built by the BIA and other 1937 Housing Act programs directed towards Indian Housing Authorities, with a block-grant program. It provides funds to be administered by the Tribes to develop their own housing. Terminology differences Native Americans are also commonly known as Indians or American Indians. A 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred American Indian to Native American. Most American Indians are comfortable with Indian, American Indian, and Native American, and the terms are often used interchangeably. They have also been known as Aboriginal Americans, Amerindians, Amerinds, Colored, First Americans, Native Indians, Indigenous, Original Americans, Red Indians, Redskins or Red Men. The term Native American was introduced in the United States by academics in preference to the older term Indian to distinguish the indigenous peoples of the Americas from the people of India. Some academics believe that the term Indian should be considered outdated or offensive while many indigenous Americans, however, prefer the term American Indian. Criticism of the neologism Native American comes from diverse sources. Some American Indians question the term Native American because, they argue, it serves to ease the conscience of \\"white America\\" with regard to past injustices done to American Indians by effectively eliminating \\"Indians\\" from the present. Others (both Indians and non-Indians) argue that Native American is problematic because \\"native of\\" literally means \\"born in,\\" so any person born in the Americas could be considered \\"native\\". Others point out that anyone born in the United States is technically native to America, so \\"native\\" is sometimes substituted for \\"indigenous.\\" The compound \\"Native American\\" is generally capitalized to differentiate the reference to the indigenous peoples. Furthermore, Russell Means, an American Indian activist, opposes the term Native American because he believes it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. He has also argued that the use of the word Indian derives not from a confusion with India but from a Spanish expression , meaning \\"in God\\".Russell Means \\"I am an American Indian, not a native American!\\" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here and here and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to and only those non-working links to text. Societal discrimination and racism discriminatory sign posted above a bar. Birney, Montana, 1941. Universities have conducted relatively little public opinion research on attitudes toward Native Americans. In 2007 the non-partisan Public Agenda organization conducted a focus group study. Most non-Native Americans admitted they rarely encountered Native Americans in their daily lives. While sympathetic toward Native Americans and expressing regret over the past, most people had only a vague understanding of the problems facing Native Americans today. For their part, Native Americans told researchers that they believed they continued to face prejudice and mistreatment in the broader society. Affirmative action issues Federal contractors and subcontractors such as businesses and educational institutions are legally required to adopt equal opportunity employment and affirmative action measures intended to prevent discrimination against employees or applicants for employment on the basis of \\"color, religion, sex, or national origin\\". For this purpose, an American Indian or Alaska Native is defined as \\"A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains a tribal affiliation or community attachment.\\" However, self- reporting is permitted, \\"Educational Institutions and Other Recipients Should Allow Students and Staff To Self-Identify Their Race and Ethnicity Unless Self-Identification Is Not Practicable or Feasible.\\" Self-reporting opens the door to \\"box checking\\" by people, who, despite not having a substantial relationship to Native American culture, either innocently or fraudulently \\"check the box\\" for Native American. On August 15, 2011 the American Bar Association passed a resolution recommending that law schools require supporting information such as evidence of tribal enrollment or connection with Native American culture. Racial achievement gap regarding language To evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction. For example, the Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.Kituwah Preservation & Education Program Powerpoint, by Renissa Walker (2012)'. 2012. Print. There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade. Because Oklahoma's official language is English, Cherokee immersion students are hindered when taking state-mandated tests because they have little competence in English. The Department of Education of Oklahoma said that in 2012 state tests: 11% of the school's sixth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 25% showed proficiency in reading; 31% of the seventh-graders showed proficiency in math, and 87% showed proficiency in reading; 50% of the eighth-graders showed proficiency in math, and 78% showed proficiency in reading. The Oklahoma Department of Education listed the charter school as a Targeted Intervention school, meaning the school was identified as a low-performing school but has not so that it was a Priority School. Ultimately, the school made a C, or a 2.33 grade point average on the state's A-F report card system. The report card shows the school getting an F in mathematics achievement and mathematics growth, a C in social studies achievement, a D in reading achievement, and an A in reading growth and student attendance. ‚ÄúThe C we made is tremendous,‚Äù said school principal Holly Davis, ‚Äú[t]here is no English instruction in our school‚Äôs younger grades, and we gave them this test in English.‚Äù She said she had anticipated the low grade because it was the school's first year as a state- funded charter school, and many students had difficulty with English. Eighth graders who graduate from the Tahlequah immersion school are fluent speakers of the language, and they usually go on to attend Sequoyah High School where classes are taught in both English and Cherokee. Native American mascots in sports A student acting as Chief Osceola, the Florida State University mascot American Indian activists in the United States and Canada have criticized the use of Native American mascots in sports as perpetuating stereotypes. European Americans have had a history of \\"playing Indian\\" that dates back to at least the 18th century.First Peoples, Colin G. Calloway, 2nd Edition, 2004 While supporters of the mascots say they embody the heroism of Native American warriors, AIM particularly has criticized the use of mascots as offensive and demeaning. In fact, many Native Americans compare this discrimination to examples for other demographics like black face for African Americans. While many universities and professional sports teams (for example, the Cleveland Indians, who had a Chief Wahoo) no longer use such images without consultation and approval by the respective nation, some lower-level schools continue to do so. However, others like Tomales Bay High and Sequoia High in the Bay Area of California, have retired their Indian mascots. In August 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) banned the use of \\"hostile and abusive\\" Native American mascots in postseason tournaments. An exception was made to allow the use of tribal names if approved by that tribe (such as the Seminole Tribe of Florida's approving use of their name for the team of Florida State University.) Environmental justice Environmental justice academic case studies examine the erasure of indigenous culture and ways of life, resource exploitation, destruction of sacred land, environmental and indigenous health, and climate justice. From the arrival of white settlers, explorers and colonizers, Native Americans have suffered from genocide, introduced diseases, warfare, and the legacy of environmental racism persists in modern day. The environmental justice movement has largely left out the Native American experience, but findings have shown that Native land is being, and has been, used for landfills, dump sites, and locations to test nuclear weapons. However, while these uses cause harm to the peoples health, they are not always unwanted. The Mescalero Apache welcomed the proposal to have a monitored retrievable nuclear waste storage facility built on their land because over one-third of the tribal citizens were unemployed, and they lacked enough housing and any sort of school system. Jamie Vickery and Lori M. Hunter have stated that the natives are being coerced into accepting the nuclear waste storage facility by their own economic hardships, which in turn has been caused by the US government direct exploitation and marginalization. Historical depictions in art Secotan Indians' dance in North Carolina, watercolor by John White, 1585 silver certificate, 1899 A number of 19th and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were Elbridge Ayer Burbank, George Catlin, Seth Eastman, Paul Kane, W. Langdon Kihn, Charles Bird King, Joseph Henry Sharp and John Mix Stanley. While many 19th-century images of Native Americans conveyed negative and unrepresentative messages, artists such as Charles Bird King portrayed Native American delegates with accuracy. His paintings are often used as records for Native American formal dress and customs. During the 16th century, the artist John White made watercolors and engravings of the people native to the southeastern states. John White's images were, for the most part, faithful likenesses of the people he observed. However, some like artist Theodore de Bry used White's original watercolors to alter the poses and features of White's figures to make them appear more European. 1892 sculpture by Alexander Milne Calder, installed on the Philadelphia City Hall. There are also many depictions of Native Americans on federal buildings, statues, and memorials. During the construction of the Capitol building in the early 19th century, the U.S. government commissioned a series of four relief panels to crown the doorway of the Rotunda. The reliefs encapsulate a vision of European‚ÄîNative American relations that had assumed mythic historical proportions by the 19th century. The four panels depict: The Preservation of Captain Smith by Pocahontas (1825) by Antonio Capellano, The Landing of the Pilgrims (1825) and The Conflict of Daniel Boone and the Indians (1826‚Äì27) by Enrico Causici and William Penn‚Äôs Treaty with the Indians (1827) by Nicholas Gevelot. The reliefs by European sculptors present versions of the Europeans and the Native Americans, in which the Europeans appear refined and the natives appear ferocious. In the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in movies and television roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included The Last of the Mohicans (1920), Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans (1957), and F Troop (1965‚Äì67). In later decades, Native American actors such as Jay Silverheels in The Lone Ranger television series (1949‚Äì57) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. For years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles relative to the white protagonists as shown in notable works like Cheyenne (1957‚Äì1963) and Law of the Plainsman (1959‚Äì1963). By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in Little Big Man (1970), Billy Jack (1971), and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) which depicted Native Americans in important lead and supporting roles. Regardless, the European narrative perspective was prioritized in popular media. The \\"sympathetic\\" yet contradictory film Dances With Wolves (1990) intentionally, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, related the Lakota story through a Euro-American voice for wider impact among a general audience.Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media. New York: Routledge, 1994. Like the 1992 remake of The Last of the Mohicans and Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), Dances with Wolves employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages. Many film scholars and Native Americans still criticize films like Dances with Wolves for its 'white savior' narrative that asserts European-Americans are the necessary saviors of people of color like Native Americans. Many documentaries have been created partly in response to unbalanced coverage of Native American perspectives in history and partly to educate the public about the shared history of conflict between Native Americans and European colonizers. In 2004 producer Guy Perrotta presented the film Mystic Voices: The Story of the Pequot War (2004), a television documentary on the first major war between colonists and Native peoples in the Americas. The documentary portrayed the conflict as a struggle between different value systems, which included not only the Pequot, but a number of other Native American tribes, most of which allied with the English. Perrotta and Charles Clemmons, another producer, intended to increase public understanding of the significance of this early event. In 2009 We Shall Remain (2009), a television documentary by Ric Burns and part of the American Experience series, presented a five-episode series \\"from a Native American perspective\\". It represented \\"an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project.\\" The five episodes explore the impact of King Philip's War on the northeastern tribes, the \\"Native American confederacy\\" of Tecumseh's War, the US-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the Trail of Tears, the pursuit and capture of Geronimo and the Apache Wars, and concludes with the Wounded Knee incident, participation by the American Indian Movement, and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since. Gambling industry Sandia Casino, owned by the Sandia Pueblo of New Mexico Gambling has become a leading industry. Casinos operated by many Native American governments in the United States are creating a stream of gambling revenue that some communities are beginning to use as leverage to build diversified economies. Native American communities have waged and prevailed in legal battles to assure recognition of rights to self-determination and to use of natural resources. Some of those rights, known as treaty rights, are enumerated in early treaties signed with the young United States government. These casinos have brought an influx of money to the tribes; according to tribal accounting firm Joseph Eve, CPAs, the average net profit of Indian casinos is 38.85%. Tribal sovereignty has become a cornerstone of American jurisprudence, and at least on the surface, in national legislative policies. Although many Native American tribes have casinos, the impact of Native American gaming is widely debated. Some tribes, such as the Winnemem Wintu of Redding, California, feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out. These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry. Crime on reservations Prosecution of serious crime, historically endemic on reservations, was required by the 1885 Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß1153, 3242, and court decisions to be investigated by the federal government, usually the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and prosecuted by United States Attorneys of the United States federal judicial district in which the reservation lies.\\"Expansion of tribal courts' authority passes Senate\\" article by Michael Riley in The Denver Post Posted: 25 June 2010 01:00:00 AM MDT Updated: 25 June 2010 02:13:47 AM MDT Accessed 2010-06-25\\"President Obama signs tribal-justice changes\\" article by Michael Riley in The Denver Post, Posted: 30 July 2010 01:00:00 AM MDT, Updated: 30 July 2010 06:00:20 AM MDT, accessed 2010-07-30 An investigation by The Denver Post in 2007 found that crimes in Indian Country have been a low priority both with the FBI and most federal prosecutors.\\"Lawless Lands\\" a 4-part series in The Denver Post last updated November 21, 2007 As of November 2012 federal resources were being reduced while high rates of crime continued to rise in Indian Country. Often serious crimes have been either poorly investigated or prosecution has been declined. Tribal courts were limited to sentences of one year or less, until on July 29, 2010 the Tribal Law and Order Act was enacted which in some measure reforms the system permitting tribal courts to impose sentences of up to three years provided proceedings are recorded and additional rights are extended to defendants.

As of 2013 inclusion of offenses by non-native men against native women in the Violence Against Women Act continued to present difficulties over the question of whether defendants who are not tribal members would be treated fairly by tribal courts or afforded constitutional guarantees. On June 6, 2012 the Justice Department announced a pilot plan to establish joint federal- tribal response teams on 6 Montana reservations to combat rape and sexual assault.  Trauma  Trauma among American Indians can be seen through historical and intergenerational trauma and can be directly related to the abuse of alcohol and substances and high rates of suicide among American Indian populations.  Historical trauma  Historical trauma is described as collective emotional and psychological damage caused by traumatic events in a person's lifetime and across multiple generations according to Dr. Laurelle Myhra, an expert on Native American mental health.Myhra, L. L. (2011). ‚ÄúIt runs in the family‚Äù: Intergenerational Transmission of Historical Trauma Among Urban American Indians and Alaska Natives in Culturally Specific Sobriety Maintenance Programs. American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research, 18(2). 17-40. National Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research. Native Americans experience historical trauma through the effects of colonization such as wars and battles with the U.S. military, assimilation, forced removal, and genocide. Outside of war and purposeful genocide, a senior lecturer on Native American literature and culture Dr. Carrie Sheffield maintains other causes are equally traumatic. She asserts that Native Americans experienced historical trauma through fatal epidemics, forced relocation to reservations, and the education of Native children at boarding schools.Carrie Louise Sheffield. ‚ÄúNative American Hip-Hop and Historical Trauma: Surviving and Healing Trauma on the ‚ÄòRez,‚Äô‚Äù Studies in American Indian Literatures 23, 23, no. 3 (2011): 94‚Äì110. Web. Even though many American Indians did not experience first hand traumatic events like the Wounded Knee Massacre, multiple generations are still affected by them. On December 29, 1890, over 200 Lakota were killed at Wounded Knee creek, South Dakota by U.S. soldiers. More than half were unarmed women and children. Unanswered pain from the Wounded Knee Massacre is still felt and has been related to present day substance abuse and violence.Weaver, H., & Congress, E. (2010). The Ongoing Impact of Colonization: Man-made Trauma and Native Americans. In A. Kalayjian & D. Eugene (Eds.), Mass Trauma and Emotional Healing Around the World: Rituals and Practices for Resilience and Meaning- Making (pp. 211-226). Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger. Experts of Native American trauma and mental health Theresa O'Nell and Tom Ball from the University of Oregon disprove the common misconception that historical trauma only occurs generations prior. They assert, contrastingly, that many current generations experienced trauma due to current violations of treaty obligations, land rights, racism, forcible relocation, and forced assimilation through federally-legislated boarding schools.Culture and PTSD : Trauma in Global and Historical Perspective. Eds. Byron Good and Devon E. Hinton. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016. Print. In their interviews with Klamath and Umatilla tribal members, they observed intense emotional responses to recounted ancestral trauma. For them, one old woman weeped recounting the massacre of her grandmother's tribe, who was just a child at the time. The loss of lands are also instrumental to the effect of historical trauma on Native Americans. Four-fifths of American Indian land was lost due to the Dawes Allotment Act of 1887. The U.S. government gave American Indian men sections of land and opened the ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù to white settlers and government interests. The psychological effects of the Dawes Allotment Act can be better appreciated when looking at American Indians relationship to the land, which is similar for all Indian tribes. Experts in Native American trauma and culture Braveheart-Jordan and DeBruyn propose the land is the origin of the people, who came out of the earth, and is the interdependent and spiritual link to all things.Braveheart-Jordan, M., & DeBruyn, L. (1995). So She May Walk in Balance: Integrating the Impact of Historical Trauma in the Treatment of Native American Indian Women. In J. Adleman & G. M. Enguidanos (Eds.), Racism in the Lives of Women: Testimony, Theory, and Guides to Antiracist Practice (pp. 345-366). Binghamton, New York: Harrington Park Press. For the Klamath tribe in the Pacific Northwest, the land provided the resources and lessons necessary for the tribe's growth, so they hold a responsibility to respect and protect the land. To understand the mechanism and impacts of historical trauma, a different understanding of time is often used. O'Nell and Bell interviewed members of the Klamath tribes and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) and documented their experiences and stories to craft tribal genograms, a pictorial display of the tribe's psychology and history. At the end of their research, they were instructed by these tribes to draw the genogram in a circle as opposed to the traditional linear form. Additionally, they were instructed to start with creation and progress in the counterclockwise direction all to maintain the tribe's \\"spiritual truth.\\" This was in order to not only connect the tribe's experiences and their psychological effects, but to interconnect the tribe's other networks like families, cultures, and spiritual beings.  Intergenerational Trauma  American Indian youth are confronted with the burden of intergenerational trauma, trauma that is passed between generations by historical or cultural trauma. A study looking at two generations of American Indians and their relationship to psychological trauma found that participants who experienced traumatic events early in their lives usually abused substances to cope.Myhra, L. L., & Wieling, E. (2014). Psychological Trauma Among American Indian Families: A Two-Generation Study. Journal of Loss and Trauma, 19. 289-313. doi: 10.1080/15325024.2013.771561 The abuse of alcohol and drugs are unhealthy coping mechanisms that many American Indians learn to use at a young age by observing parental practices.Cole, N. (2006). Trauma and the American Indian. In T. M. Witko (Ed.), Mental Health Care for Urban Indians: Clinical Insights from Native Practitioners (pp. 115-130). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Often youth begin to take on these traumas and can abuse alcohol and drugs to the point of death in some cases. This can contribute to American Indian adolescents exceeding the national average for alcohol and drug related deaths; being 1.4 and 13.3 times higher.Paul, T. M., Lusk, S. L., Becton, A. B., & Glade, R. (2017). Exploring the Impact of Substance Abuse, Culture, and Trauma on American Indian Adolescents. Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling, 48(1). 31-39. Peter Menzies, the clinical head of Aboriginal Services at the Center for Addictions and Mental Health in Toronto, also proposes that government-sanctioned boarding schools are a key proponent of intergenerational trauma for Native Americans. He claims that former students adopted parenting methods like corporal punishment and loud berating tactics which then traumatize the children in a similar way.Menzies, Peter. \\"Understanding Aboriginal Intergeneration Trauma from a Social Work Perspective.\\" The Canadian Journal of Native Studies 27.2 (2007): 367-92. Ethnic NewsWatch, ProQuest Central. Web. Additionally, Dr. Sheffield suggests that Native Americans experience a degree of intergenerational cultural trauma. According to Sheffield, the United States is a collection of \\"settler colonies\\" where the colonizers have not left. Therefore, the European-influenced culture grew to dominate the existing Native American culture with offensive representations like a \\"savage\\" and a \\"dying breed.\\" These influences, according to Sheffield, collectively lead to the loss of cultural cohesion in the Native American community. = Boarding School = Many American Indians were forcibly assimilated into American culture after being abducted from reservations through boarding schools that were designed to 'civilize' them. ‚ÄúKill the Indian and save the man‚Äù was the motto and belief.Grayshield, L., Rutherford, J. J., Salazar, S. B., Mihecoby, A. L., & Luna, L. L. (2015). Understanding and Healing Historical Trauma: The Perspectives of Native American Elders. Journal of Mental Health Counseling, 37(4). 295-307. doi: 10.17744/mech.37.4.02 Some documented practices to assimilate children at these boarding schools included shaving of children's hair, corporal punishments for speaking in native languages, manual labor to sustain the campus facilities, and intense daily regimentation.Lajimodiere, Denise. \\"A Healing Journey.\\" Wicazo Sa Review 27.2 (2012): 5-19. Web. A less documented practice includes the use of DDT and kerosene in children's hair upon arrival to the boarding schools. Boarding schools were often packed with children in order to gain more grant money, and became centers for diseases such as trachoma and tuberculosis. Due to general inefficiency in handling outbreaks of diseases, many native children died at the boarding schools, often without having their parents notified or having been able to contact any family. Experts on Native American trauma support that boarding schools were a key proponent of intergenerational trauma. Former students who survived the schools turned towards alcohol and drugs to cope with the trauma. These coping methods were then passed on to their children since they seemed like acceptable means of handling trauma. These former students also use similar parenting practices they received at boarding school on their own children. As explained by Menzies, the trauma suffered by these former students is continued into their children's generation through parental methods and modeled substance abuse. Menzies furthers that because the former students abused substances to cope with their trauma of boarding school, the children of these students cope with this trauma the same way. In response to the psychological and intergenerational trauma caused, the National Boarding School Healing Project (NBSHP) was launched as a partnership to document these experiences and their effects on Native Americans. When some participants were asked about potential healing methods to their trauma, they suggested that communities in general should return to traditional Native American spiritual practices while former students of boarding schools specifically should attempt forgiveness in order to release internal turmoil and hatred.  Solutions  Many researchers, psychologists, counselors, and social workers are calling for culturally competent practitioners as well as using culturally appropriate practices when working with American Indian clients. The Wellbriety Movement creates a space for American Indians to learn how to reconnect with their culture by using culturally specific principles to become and remain sober. Some examples are burning sage, cedar, and sweetgrass as a means to cleanse physical and spiritual spaces, verbally saying prayers and singing in one's own tribal language, and participating in tribal drum groups and ceremonies as part of meetings and gatherings.Coyhis, D., & Simonelli, R. (2008). The Native American Healing Experience. Substance Use & Misuse, 43. 1927-1949. doi: 10.1080/10826080802292584 Dr. Michael T. Garrett, an assistant professor of counsel education at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, proposes that psychologists must adopt mental-health practices that cultivate Native American values rather than conflicting contemporary mainstream American ideals.Handbook of Race and Development in Mental Health. Eds. Edward C. Chang and Christina A. Downey. 1st ed. ed. New York, NY: Springer New York, 2012. Print. Some of these views include interconnectedness of the mind, body, and soul, the connection between humanity and nature, internal self-discipline, and appreciation of the present while the future is received in its own time. These are partly in response to the varied degrees of acculturation Native American individuals present. Garrett describes some possible degrees of acculturation: \\"marginal\\" where Native Americans may speak English with their native language and do not identify totally with neither mainstream American ideals or tribal customs or \\"assimilated\\" where Native American individuals have embraced mainstream American ideals and renounced their tribal familial connections. Additional solutions, as proposed by the Klamath tribe, are government restoration of land rights and the following of past treaty obligations. They propose that the restoration of tribal recognition by the federal government has partly healed their historical trauma. They maintain, however, that intergenerational trauma will not be healed until their traditional relationship to the land is restored in order to ground the tribe's \\"immortal connections\\" back to their place in the world. For the Klamath tribes, another solution is to constantly remember their history through their counter narrative rather than through the dominant narrative of non-Native oppressors in order to preserve the tribe's formerly oppressed spirit.  Education  The majority of Native American youth attend public schools that are not tribally controlled. For those Native Americans who view education as a means of preserving their ancient knowledge, culture and language, this raises questions about tribal self-determination.  History  The first educational institutions for Native Americans were founded by missionaries. The primary objectives of missionary education were to civilize, individualize and Christianize Native American youth. Early colonial colleges, Harvard, William and Mary, Dartmouth and Hamilton, were established in part to educate Native Americans. Dartmouth College was the first college founded primarily for the education of Native Americans. Lack of support from the public and infighting amongst the missionaries led to the closure of most missionary schools in the 19th century. During the 19th century, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began to fund Native American education. The BIA founded boarding schools for Native American youth that were modeled after the off-reservation Carlisle Indian Industrial School. These government-run boarding schools were located at former military posts and used an assimilationist education model. Native American students were enrolled in the \\"outing system,\\" a system where they were placed in white homes to work during the summers. Between 1870 and 1920, the federal government increased its role in providing Native American elementary and secondary school education, and boarding schools became the predominant form of Native American education. In the 1960s, the Native American self- determination movement pushed for more tribal involvement in education. The Higher Education Act of 1965 provided for the development of postsecondary institutions for minority students. The passage of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 gave tribes the power to control their funds for welfare and education. Today, approximately 92 percent of Native American youth attend public schools, and approximately eight percent attend schools operated or funded by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). Tribally controlled education has become a key part of the Native American self-determination movement.  Tribally Controlled Schools  Further information: Tribal colleges and universities, Native American self- determination In the early 1800s, the first tribally controlled schools were established by five Southeastern tribes: the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cree and Seminole. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 and other federal forced relocation policies shut down these tribally controlled schools. The next 100 years of Native American education were dominated by missionary and federal run off-reservation boarding schools. The 1960s saw the emergence of the Native American self-determination movement and a renewed support for tribally controlled education. The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) was passed in 1968 and recognized the need for community-controlled bilingual programs. In 1965, the Navajo Education Department in cooperation with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), and a nonprofit (DINE) established the first school with an all-Indian governing board‚ÄîRough Rock Community School. In 1968, Din√© College (Navajo Community College originally) was established as the first tribally controlled college. Other tribes followed suit and in 1971 formed the Coalition of Indian-Controlled Schools. This coalition drove the creation and enactment of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. In the years following the passage of the 1972 Indian Education Act and the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, more than 75 tribally controlled primary and secondary schools, and 24 community colleges were established. In 1973, the first six tribally controlled colleges joined together to found the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC). Today, 37 tribally controlled colleges are part of the AIHEC. The passage of the Native American Languages Act of 1990 guaranteed Native Americans the right to maintain and promote their languages and cultural systems through educational programs. Currently, the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) oversees 183 elementary and secondary schools, 126 of these schools are tribally controlled.  Contemporary Challenges  Further information: Native Americans and reservation inequality#Contemporary reservation school situations Native American communities face significant educational challenges, such as inadequate school funding, lack of qualified teachers, student achievement gap, underrepresentation in higher education and high dropout rates. Tribally controlled schools receive funding directly from the BIE. The implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 at a state level made it so that tribally controlled schools had to assume responsibility for state-level tasks without support. The Act linked funding to test scores, which resulted in decreased funding for many tribally controlled schools. Native American students have the lowest high school graduation rates of any minority in the United States. Dropout rates amongst Native American youth are also the highest in the nation. There is a 15 percent drop-out rate amongst Native American 16-24 year olds, compared to the national average of 9.9 percent. Native American students are underrepresented in higher education at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels. The recruitment and retention of Native American students at a university level is a major issue. Native American professors are also underrepresented; they make up less than one percent of higher education faculty. There is a need for adequately trained teachers and appropriate curriculum in Native American education. Western education models are not hospitable to indigenous epistemologies. The No Child Left Behind Act and English-only ballot initiatives make it difficult to adopt culturally relevant curriculum.  STEM Education  Tribes are attempting to incorporate Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, curriculum into their education systems, but there is as yet no consensus on how to do so. Native Americans are underrepresented by a factor of at least four in STEM disciplines. In 2012, Native American students accounted for only 0.6 percent of bachelor's degrees, 0.4 percent of master's degrees and 0.2 percent of doctoral degrees in science and engineering. = Benefits = Some tribes have used technology to preserve their culture and languages through digital storytelling, computer language platforms, audio recordings, webpages and other forms of media. Technology also contributes to economic and educational development. STEM knowledge helps Native youth enter into Western jobs. Increased representation in STEM fields could aid the Native American self-determination movement. Native Americans in STEM could assume the role of controlling their own land and resources. = Concerns = Native and non- native scholars have developed curricula to integrate Western knowledge with indigenous knowledge, but there is no agreement on a best approach. The federal government has funded projects in collaboration with Native American schools that focus on the use of technology to support culturally responsive curriculum. The implementation of these technologies and curricula remains almost non-existent at an institutional level. Elders in tribal communities often fear that exposure to technology will result in assimilation. Underrepresentation in digital content contributes to this fear. Digital equity is a concern as tribes have to appropriate resources for technological infrastructure maintenance, develop standards to protect sacred tribal information and determine how to promote tribal goals. STEM curriculum is often dismissive of Native worldviews. Western STEM models contradict Native science because they emphasize individuality and humans as separate from the natural world. Science curriculum does not respect cultural taboos. Native American students view human and animal dissections as the most problematic STEM activities. Research suggests that a majority of Native American students would be more likely to take STEM classes if the curriculum was more respectful of taboos. = Potential Solutions = Practices proven to increase Native student's interest in STEM are: caring mentors, hands-on learning, observational learning, collaboration, real-world applications and community involvement. Some tribal STEM programs are employing community-based science curriculum. The characteristics of community-based science curriculum are that it is local, place-based, hands-on, involves the community, incorporates system-thinking and a holistic view a science and explores multiple epistemologies. The Science, Technology, Society (STS) model asks students to explore a problem that is relevant to them and their community. It incorporates human experiential context with science. Other models emphasize the value of incorporating Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and \\"indigenous realism,\\" the recognition of the interconnectedness of everything in nature. The Maker culture, or maker movement, is another model that has the potential to support minority youth in learning STEM. The Hackerspace can provide a positive, non-school based STEM learning experience for youth who are marginalized in school. Public health As of 2004, according to the United States Commission on Civil Rights: \\"Native Americans die of diabetes, alcoholism, tuberculosis, suicide, and other health conditions at shocking rates. Beyond disturbingly high mortality rates, Native Americans also suffer a significantly lower health status and disproportionate rates of disease compared with all other Americans.\\" In addition to increasing numbers of American Indians entering the fields of community health and medicine, agencies working with Native American communities have sought partnerships, representatives of policy and program boards, and other ways to learn and respect their traditions and to integrate the benefits of Western medicine within their own cultural practices. A comprehensive review of 32 articles about Indigenous Historical Trauma and its relation to health outcomes in Indigenous populations affirmed that historical hardships experienced by previous Indigenous generations can have a transmitted impact on the health and wellbeing of current Indigenous generations. The articles examined Indigenous populations in both the United States and Canada. The systematic review resulted in three categories of research. * 19 articles focused on health outcomes for Indigenous people who experienced historical loss either personally or transgenerationally. Historical loss was measured in accordance with the Historical Loss Scale created by Whitbeck, Adams, et al.(2004). Twelve types of loss were identified, including ‚Äúloss of our land‚Äù ‚Äúloss of our language‚Äù, and ‚Äúloss of our traditional spiritual ways‚Äù. * 11 articles focused on the theme of residential school ancestry studies which took a closer look at Indigenous people mainstreamed into Indian boarding school systems and the correlated health impacts of those individuals or the relatives of those individuals. * three articles were categorized as ‚Äúother‚Äù. Two of the articles focused on the outcomes of a psychoeducation intervention and the remaining article examined the health outcomes of families who had a grandparent subjected to a relocation program. Alcoholism The community suffers a vulnerability to and a disproportionately high rate of alcoholism., Management of Science of Health Alcohol abuse is widespread in Native American communities. Native Americans use and abuse alcohol and other drugs at younger ages, and at higher rates, than that of all other ethnic groups. Consequently, their age-adjusted alcohol-related mortality rate is 5.3 times greater than the general population. The Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported the following for 1997: 19.8 percent of Native Americans ages 12 and older reported using illegal drugs that year, compared with 11.9 percent for the total U.S. population. Native Americans had the highest prevalence rates of marijuana and cocaine use, in addition to the need for drug abuse treatment. Tribal governments have long prohibited the sale of alcohol on reservations, but generally, it is readily for sale in nearby border towns, and off-reservation businesses and states gain income from the business. As an example, in 2010, beer sales at off-reservation outlets in Whiteclay, Nebraska generated $413,932 that year in federal and sales taxes. Their customers are overwhelmingly Lakota from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.Stephanie Woodward, \\"Gold Mines in Hell\\", 100Reporters, February 2012 Acknowledging that prohibition has not worked, in a major change in strategy since the late 20th century, as of 2007, 63 percent of the federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states had legalized alcohol sales on their reservations. Among these, all the other tribes in South Dakota have legalized sales, as have many in Nebraska. The tribes decided to retain the revenues that previously would go to the states through retail sales taxes on this commodity. Legalizing the sales enables the tribes to keep more money within their reservation economies and support new businesses and services, as well as to directly regulate, police and control alcohol sales. The retained revenues enable them to provide health care and build facilities to better treat individuals and families suffering from alcohol abuse.James N. Hughes III, \\"Pine Ridge, Whiteclay and Indian Liquor Law\\", Federal Indian Law Seminar, December 2010, p. 7, University of Nebraska College of Law, accessed 2012-02-27 In some cases, legalization of alcohol sales also supported the development of resorts and casinos, to generate revenues for other economic enterprises. =Consequences of alcoholism= Native Americans and Whites have the highest rates of Driving Under the Influence (DUI). A 2007 study conducted by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reports that 13.3% of Native Americans report past-year DUI. Of 1660 people from seven Native American tribes, the lifetime prevalence of alcohol dependence ranged from 21%-56% for men and 17%-30% for women among all tribes. Physical and sexual abuse significantly increased the chances of alcohol dependence for men. Sexual abuse and boarding school attendance increased the odds of alcohol dependence among women. Native Americans, especially women, are at high risk for alcohol-related trauma, such as rape and assault. =Unintentional injuries due to alcoholism= Unintentional injuries account for the third leading cause of death for Native Americans and the leading cause of death for Native Americans under 44 years old. Unintentional injuries include motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian-related motor vehicle crashes, drowning, and fire-related injuries. From 1985 to 1996, 1,484 Native American children died in motor vehicle crashes, which is twice the rate for white children. National estimates of alcohol-related motor vehicle deaths show that Native Americans have a 250% higher death rate compared to the US population.  Cancer  Studies have indicated that there are fewer cases of cancer in Native Americans than other ethnic groups. However, cancer is prevalent in Native Alaskan women and Native American women as the leading and second leading cause of death, respectively. Death rates are 70% of that for whites, indicating that the ratio of death by cancer to new cancer cases is the highest for Native Americans compared to other ethnic groups. Women have been diagnosed with later-stage breast and cervical cancer. Native Indian and Alaska Native people are disproportionately prone to colon and lung cancer. In some communities, this is consistent with a high prevalence of risk factors such as smoking. One research about the Pacific Northwest Native Americans found that there were many misidentified rates of cancer between 1996-1997. This misclassification was due to a low Native American blood quantum, resulting in an over-reported amount of Native Americans diagnosed with cancer. Because the research took data from the Oregon State Cancer Registry, the Washington State Cancer Registry, and the Cancer Data Registry of Idaho to research tribes in the respected states, their findings show that cancer rates among tribes in the US are heterogeneous. However, data collected from cancer cases are limited. Regardless, experts have suggested that Native Americans experience cancer differently than other ethnic groups. This can be due to genetic risk factors, late detection of cancer, poor compliance with recommended treatment, the presence of concomitant disease, and lack of timely access to diagnostic and/or treatment methods. According to researchers, addressing underlying risk factors and low screening rates by implementing aggressive screening programs can prevent cancer from forming in Native Indian and Alaska Native communities.  Diabetes  Native Americans have some of the highest rates of diabetes in the world, specifically Type 2 diabetes. Although mostly diagnosed in adults, children are increasingly being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes as well. Type 2 diabetes may be manageable through healthy eating, exercising, oral medication, or insulin injections. A study published in Environmental Health Perspectives found that the prevalence of diabetes found in Native Americans of the Mohawk Nation was 20.2% due to traces of pesticides in food sources, where elevated serum PCBs, DDE, and HBC were associated. Mirex did not have a connection. There is some recent epidemiological evidence that diabetes in the Native American population may be exacerbated by a high prevalence of suboptimal sleep duration.  Major cardiovascular disease  Heart disease accounts for the number one cause of death among Native Americans, causing them to have twice the rate of cardiovascular disease than the US population. High rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, and risk factors (unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyle) contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Mental health  Native Americans are at high risk for mental disorders. The most prevalent concerns due to mental health include substance abuse, suicide, depression, anxiety, and violence. High rates of homelessness, incarceration, alcohol and drug abuse, and stress and trauma in Native American communities might attribute to the risk. According to The Surgeon General's report, the U.S. mental health system is not equipped to meet the needs of Native Americans. Moreover, the budget constraints of the Indian Health Service allows only basic psychiatric emergency care.  Suicide  Suicide is a major public health problem for American Indians in the United States. = Prevalence of suicide among Native Americans = The Suicide rate for American Indians and Alaskan Natives is approximately 190% of the rate for the general population. Among American Indians/Alaska Natives aged 10 to 34 years suicide is the second leading cause of death with suicide ranked as the eighth leading cause of death for American Indians/Alaska Natives of all ages Youth who have experienced life stressors are disproportionately affected by risky behaviors and at greater risk for suicide ideation. Suicide rates among American Indians and Alaska Natives youth are higher than those for other populations. The rate of suicide for American Indian/Alaskan Natives is 70% higher than for that of the general population and youth between age 10 and 24 are the most at risk. College students are also among those most at risk for suicide; select data from the National College Health Association National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) found that approximately 15% of American Indian students reported seriously contemplating suicide over the past 12 months, compared with 9.1% of non-American Indian students; 5.7% of American Indian students reported attempting suicide, compared with 1.2% of non-American Indian students = Suicide prevention = Prevention aims at halting or stopping the development of individual or social problem which is already evident. Prevention is different from intervention and treatment in that it is aimed at general population groups or individuals with various levels of risk. Prevention's goal is to reduce risk factors and enhance protective factors. Suicide prevention is a collective effort of organizations, communities, and mental health practitioners to reduce the incidence of suicide. Social workers have an important role to play in suicide prevention. Social workers are the largest occupational group of mental health professionals in the US, thus they play a significant role in the national approach to preventing suicide. The social work approach to suicide prevention among Native Americans identifies and addresses the individual's immediate clinical needs, community/environmental influences, and societal risk factors.  Possible programs to improve native health disparities  = Indian Health Service = The Indian Health Service (IHS) was established within the Public Health Service in 1955 in order to meet federal treaty obligations to provide health services to members of federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. The IHS consists of three branches of service: the federally operated direct care system, independent tribally operated health care services, and urban Indian health care services. = Affordable Care Act = In addition to the Indian Health Services, researchers have data suggesting that the Affordable Care Act supplements Native American healthcare. With the two services, tribes have greater flexibility in health care availability. Tribes have direct access to IHS funds, which can be administered via contracts and other arrangements made with providers. However, it alters trust relationships. The Affordable Care Act provides an opportunity for uninsured adults to gain Medicaid coverage. Although half of the uninsured adults are white, increases in coverage expand to all races to substantially reduce racial gaps in health insurance coverage. With new outreach and enrollment efforts, streamlined enrollment systems, penalties for not having health insurance coverage, the availability of newly created health insurance exchanges, and the expectation under the ACA that everyone will have insurance coverage, enrollment in Medicaid will increase in low-income communities. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which is part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, does not guarantee a health care arrangement of the kind Americans have generally come to expect‚Äînamely, comprehensive inpatient and outpatient services available on the basis of need‚Äî a critical point when considering the IHS, which is often mistaken for a Native American health insurance program. According to the governor of the Pueblo of Tesuque Mark Mitchell, IHS does not cover everything that insurance does. It is not an entitlement program, unlike Medicare or Medicaid. The IHS is a series of direct health care services provided at IHS facilities. A key distinction between IHS health services and insurance concerns the policy framework and logic of budgeting that underpins them. This produces a fundamentally different dynamic than that which drives programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, or especially private managed care plans. The IHS does what it can with the resources it is provided by Congress but is not obligated to provide the services required to meet the broader health needs of Native Americans in the pursuit of measurable outcomes. = The Oregon Experiment = In 2008, Oregon initiated Medicaid to 10,000 of a randomized 90,000 low-income, uninsured adults to participate in what is now known as the Oregon Medicaid health experiment. Within 4 study groups of one study, researchers observed that utilization of primary care services will increase, as more individuals will begin and continue to use medical care. The study was limited to the Portland metropolitan area.Katherine Baicker, Sarah Taubman, Heidi Allen, Mira Bernstein, Jonathan Gruber, Joseph P. Newhouse, Eric Schneider, Bill Wright, Alan Zaslavsky, Amy Finkelstein, and the Oregon Health Study Group, \\"The Oregon Experiment ‚Äì Effects of Medicaid on Clinical Outcomes\\", The New England Journal of Medicine, 2013 May; 368(18): 1713-1722. Researchers concluded that investment in primary care could help attend and mitigate the health care needs of individuals.

The harbour lies between the Lyari River delta and Chinna Creek to the north, and the Arabian Sea to the south. Since 1886, sections of the harbour have been improved to form the Port of Karachi - Pakistan's busiest seaport.  Geography  The harbour is divided into an Upper and Lower Harbour, which together have a length of 11.5 kilometers. The Upper Harbour has been developed into the Port of Karachi, and is located between the East and West Wharfs of the port, where it then goes on eastward to form a series of backwaters with thick mangrove forests known as Chinna Creek. Along the western edge of the West Wharf is a small local fishing harbour known as the Karachi Fish Harbour, built in 1958, and the delta of the Lyari River. The Lower Harbour, also known as Baba Channel, stretches from Manora Point and Kiamari to the port, and serves as a shipping channel between the port and the Arabian Sea.  History  Nearchus, who commanded Alexander the Great's naval fleet, mentioned a hilly island by the name of Morontobara and an adjacent flat island named Bibakta, which colonial historians identified as Karachi's Manora Point and Kiamari (or Clifton), respectively, based on Greek descriptions. Both areas were island until well into the colonial era, when silting in led to them being connected to the mainland. In 711 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Indus Valley and the port of Debal, from where he launched his forces further into the Indus Valley in 712. Some have identified the port with Karachi, though some argue the location was somewhere between Karachi and the nearby city of Thatta. Under Mirza Ghazi Beg, the Mughal administrator of Sindh, the development of coastal Sindh and the Indus River Delta was encouraged. Under his rule, fortifications in the region acted as a bulwark against Portuguese incursions into Sindh. Karachi is also mentioned in the sixteenth century Turkish treatise Mir'√¢t √ºl Mem√¢lik (Mirror of Countries, 1557) by the Ottoman captain Seydi Ali Reis, which warns sailors about whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in \\"Kaurashi\\" harbour if they found themselves drifting dangerously. In 1728 heavy rains silted up the harbour at Kharak, forcing merchants to relocate to the area of modern Karachi. 19th century Karachi historian Seth Naomal Hotchand recorded that a small settlement of 20‚Äì25 huts existed along the Karachi Harbour that was known as Dibro, which was situated along a pool of water known as Kolachi-jo-Kun. In 1725, a band of Balochi settlers from Makran and Kalat had settled in the hamlet after fleeing droughts and tribal feuds. A new settlement was built in 1729 at the site of Dibro, which came to be known as Kolachi-jo-Goth (\\"The village of Kolachi\\"), which grew into the modern city. The gate facing the sea was called \\"Kharadar\\" (salt gate), and the gate facing the Lyari River5 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Lyari (info about Lyari River) hamaralyari.com website, Retrieved 5 January 2018 was called \\"Mithadar\\" (sweet gate). From 1729 to 1783 the strategic location of Kolachi saw the town change hands several times between the Khans of Kalat and the rulers of Sind. In 1783, after two prolonged sieges the town fell to the Talpur Mirs of Sind, who constructed a fort mounted with cannons on Manora island at the harbour entrance. The British East India Company captured Karachi on 3 February 1839 after opened fire and quickly destroyed Manora Fort, which guarded Karachi Harbour at Manora Point. Karachi was recognized for its strategic importance, prompting the British to establish the Port of Karachi in 1854. Karachi rapidly became a transportation hub for British India owing to newly built port and rail infrastructure, as well as the increase in agricultural exports from the opening of productive tracts of newly irrigated land in Punjab and interior Sindh. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Karachi Harbour became an important cotton-exporting port, with Indus Steam Flotilla and Orient Inland Steam Navigation Company established to transport cotton from interior Sindh to the harbour, and onwards to textile mills in England. With the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Karachi's position as a major port increased even further. In 1878, the British Raj connected Karachi with the network of British India's vast railway system. In 1887, Karachi Port underwent radical improvements with connection to the railways, along with expansion and dredging of the port, and construction of a breakwater.  Island settlements   Baba and Bhit Islands  Baba and Bhit are two small and densely populated islands located in the Karachi Harbor, near Karachi.Kiamari Town - Government of Karachi The approximate area of the islands is 4 km¬≤ and the population is about 25,000. The islands are connected to Karachi via a ferry service to Keamari.  Kakapir  Kakapir is a fishing village in Karachi Harbour, 15 kilometers west of Karachi. It is located at the western end of Sandspit Beach, near Hawke's Bay Beach. Mauripur lies to its north. Kakapir is named for a saint, whose shrine is located in the village, who reportedly was known for his brown hair. The village is reportedly about 100 years old. Residents of the village were originally from the Mithadar and Kharadar neighborhoods of Karachi, who were settled by the British in Shams Pir during the construction of the Port of Karachi. Those residents migrated further west and established Kakapir.  Shams Pir  Shams Pir is an island village near Karachi, Pakistan, along the western end of Karachi Harbour, close to Sandspit Beach and Kakapir. The village is bordered by thick Mangrove forests which grow in the harbor.

History In 1969, Ken Kreuter established Kreuter Manufacturing Company to manufacture pneumatic HVAC controls. In 1970, the company moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba because of business incentives. In 1974, the company moved to Minnesota, and, in 1978, the company moved manufacturing operations to its present location in New Paris, Indiana. In 1989, the research and development side of the business (then known as Kreuter Engineering) made the transition from Minnesota to Indiana as well in order to consolidate all company operations. In 1995, Kreuter Manufacturing Company, Inc. began doing business as KMC Controls, Inc., a name change that better reflected its business. Over the decades, analog electronic and then DDC (Direct Digital Control) products were added to the original pneumatic line.\\"About KMC,\\" KMC Controls.  Products  KMC Controls Product Family Samples KMC Controls started with manufacturing pneumatic HVAC control products, including controllers, actuators, valves, and other related devices. A pneumatic HVAC control circuit operates on air pressure (typically between 3 and 13 psi) and uses mechanical means (actuators) to perform control functions. Pneumatic control systems are still used in many buildings, especially in metropolitan areas, because of their large base of installation throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Throughout the 1980s, analog electronic control devices became increasingly popular.See, for example, HVAC control system. They provided faster response and higher precision than pneumatics. KMC manufactures electronic sensors, variable air volume controllers, thermostats, actuators, valves, and other devices that operate from low voltage DC analog signals. In the 1990s, the standard became microprocessor- based direct digital controls that process a variety of analog and binary inputs and outputs. KMC Controls offers controllers and software in its KMDigital line using a proprietary protocol as well as a BACnet line with an open systems protocol.\\"Catalogs & Brochures,\\" KMC Controls.

Constance inherited all of her titles from her mother and contended to inherit her father's Viscounty of B√©arn. She was married three times during her lifetime, marrying into the royal families of Aragon, Castile and England. \\" Life Constance was born between 1245 and 1255 the daughter of Gaston VII, Viscount of B√©arn and Martha of Marsan. She had three sisters: Margaret, Martha and Guilemette. No exact birth dates are known for any of the sisters, all were born within the aforementioned timeframe but Constance was most probably the eldest because she inherited Martha's estates when she died. Marriages When Constance was in her early teenage years, she travelled to Aragon and married at Calatayud on March 23, 1260 to Infante Alfonso, son and heir of James I of Aragon. The marriage only lasted three days, Alfonso died on March 26. In 1266, Constance was betrothed to Infante Manuel of Castile, who was son of Ferdinand III of Castile. Manuel's first wife, Constance's one-time sister-in-law Constance of Aragon had died, so Manuel was seeking remarriage.RAH, Colecci√≥n Salazar y Castro, M-13, fo 211 y 211 v (no. 48499). A marriage contract was signed at Seville, with Constance's sister Guilemette being betrothed to Manuel's son Alfonso. However, nothing came of the arrangements and so neither couple married.Gonz√°lez Jim√©nez, Manuel. 'VII'. Alfonso X the Wise (1st edition). Barcelona: Editorial Ariel SA. pp. 205. A third marriage contract was drawn up in 1268, for Constance to marry Henry of Almain,Veterum Scriptorum I, col. 1356. a grandson of King John of England. She travelled to England the following year and the couple were married at Windsor Castle on 5 May 1269. This second marriage was also brief, Henry repudiated Constance the following year and then died himself in 1271. Constance married for a third and final time in 1279 to Aymon II of Geneva. The marriage had been arranged by Constance's stepmother Beatrice of Savoy, Dame of Faucigny. Like the first two marriages, this marriage was also brief with Aymon dying within a year. Constance had no children.Cox (1974), 435‚Äì36 Inheritance disputes Upon the death of Constance's mother, she succeeded her as Viscountess of Marsan. Through her mother, Constance had a claim on the County of Bigorre,Monlezun Histoire de Gascogne, Tome VI, p. 366. her mother had been actively pursuing her claim against her niece, Laura, who was sister to the previous Count, Eskivat de Chabanais. Fighting over Bigorre had begun in 1251 due to the problems left by Constance's maternal grandmother Petronilla, Countess of Bigorre. She had made Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, governor of Bigorre and upon her death, he had refused to hand over control to Constance's aunt Alice. With assistance from Constance's parents, Alice had succeeded. The brief time of stability ended with the death of Eskivat. Martha then claimed Bigorre, as did Laura. Upon the death of Martha during the late 1270s, Constance inherited her claim. Her father, Gaston then assisted his daughter by attacking Bigorre, which was once again occupied by Simon de Montfort. The overlord, Edward I of England, did not like the thought of a union between B√©arn and Bigorre so had John Grailly placed there as general, forcing Gaston to pull back. Constance responded by appealing to Philip IV of France, who responded by calling the whole family to his court to discuss the situation, but eventually seized Bigorre for the crown.Merlet ¬¥Proc√®s¬¥, Pi√®ces Justificatives, XIV, p. 322, quoting Cartulaire de Bigorre, ch. 36. Bigorre then remained under French control until it was claimed in 1425 by John I, Count of Foix, a descendant of Constance's sister, Margaret. Gaston never had any sons, Beatrice of Savoy bore him no children so his heirs were his four daughters. Gaston bypassed the claim of Constance, possibly due to her inheritance of her mother's own Viscount of Marsan and instead decided to leave the Viscount of B√©arn to his second daughter, Margaret and her husband Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix. Gaston's will was disputed by their third sister Martha and her husband Gerald VI, Count of Armagnac. As a result, Guilemette was made heiress, bypassing the claims of Constance, Margaret and Martha. Upon the death of Gaston in 1290, disputes had made him leave Constance with B√©arn but she soon handed it over to her sister Margaret, who had children of her own at this point, whilst Constance remained without children.Biography-Fran√ßaise , vol. 14, 1979, Roger Bernard III of Foix by Roman Amat. Constance died on April 26, 1310, only five days after her stepmother Beatrice. Marsan then passed to Margaret, joining it with the B√©arn inheritance.

When asked to confirm such debate, Rockstar Games simply stated that his surname \\"may or may not be Speed,\\" and that it seems \\"very likely\\" that they are the same character. Throughout almost the entire story of Grand Theft Auto III, Claude is seen wearing a black leather jacket with a black T-shirt underneath, green cargo pants, and blue trainers with white soles. He also has dark brown hair with his fringe sticking out. Claude is never seen or heard uttering a single word throughout his appearances (excluding quiet grunts when he is injured or killed). When questioned about this topic, Rockstar stated that \\"[they] had so many other problems to solve and this did not seem like a major issue\\". At one point during the course of a game, Maria makes a telephone call to one of the in-game radio stations, explaining that she \\"met a new man\\" but \\"he don't talk too much\\". Claude continues to stay silent during his cameo appearances in San Andreas. Despite rumours, Rockstar \\"at no point\\" planned to make Claude a speaking protagonist. Appearances  Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas  Very little is known about Claude's background, other than he was most likely born and lived in San Andreas until 1992, when the events of the game take place. He owned an abandoned garage in San Fierro, and apparently was a top contender in a local illegal racing ring. After Catalina breaks up with the game's protagonist, Carl \\"CJ\\" Johnson, she meets Claude under unknown circumstances and quickly enters a relationship with him. The pair later begin to make plans to leave for Liberty City, but Claude bets his car in a final race, which he loses to CJ. Needing the car for their travel, Catalina instead gives CJ the deed to Claude's garage, not informing him of its state. Following this, Claude and Catalina leave San Andreas, but the latter calls CJ several times throughout the storyline to tell him about her relationship with Claude in an attempt to make him jealous, to no effect; the final call occurs at the end of the game, where Claude and Catalina can be heard having sex.  Grand Theft Auto III  In 2001, Claude and Catalina finally arrive in Liberty City and become involved with the Colombian Cartel. However, during a bank robbery, Claude is betrayed and left for dead by Catalina. Though arrested, he escapes during his transfer to prison when members of the Cartel ambush his transport to abduct another prisoner. During his escape, Claude befriends bomb expert 8-Ball, who then introduces him to the Leone Mafia family, for whom he begins working. At first, Claude does small job for made man Luigi Goterelli, but is eventually introduced to higher-ranking Leones, such as caporegime Toni Cipriani and the Don's son Joey Leone, whom he assists in their conflict with the Triads. Ultimately, Claude earns the respect of Don Salvatore Leone, who, after discovering that the Cartel are manufacturing a new street drug to fund their expansion into Liberty City, instructs Claude to destroy their floating drug lab with 8-Ball's help. Shortly after, Salvatore asks Claude to deal with a minor problem, but his trophy wife Maria, whom he met during an earlier job for Salvatore, reveals it to be a set-up. Claiming that Salvatore has become paranoid and intends to kill him, Claude takes her with him to Staunton Island. There, Maria introduces Claude to the Yakuza, led by Asuka Kasen and her brother Kenji, who assign him work after he assassinates Salvatore to cut his ties with the Leone family. During this time, Claude also meets corrupt LCPD detective Ray Machowski, whom he later helps flee the city, and media mogul Donald Love, who has him rescue the prisoner abducted earlier by the Cartel, and carry out a hit on Kenji under the guise of a Cartel attack to start a gang war that will allow him to obtain real estate for his businesses. Eventually, Claude encounters Catalina, now the leader of the Cartel, at a construction site during one of Love's jobs, only for her to escape. Following Love's mysterious disappearance, Claude resumes work for Asuka, who has the Yakuza take over the site, blaming the Cartel for her brother's death, and tortures Catalina's partner Miguel, whom she left behind, for information. Under her direction, Claude starts dismantling the Cartel's operations, including their drug distribution network, earning Catalina's wrath. In retaliation, she murders Miguel and Asuka, and kidnaps Maria, ransoming her for $500,000. When Claude meets with her to hand over the ransom payment, Catalina double-crosses him once again, leading to him escaping the trap and killing her when she attempts to escape by helicopter. With Maria saved, she and Claude flee the scene, though as she complains about what happened to her, a gunshot rings out, leaving Maria's fate ambiguous.  Other appearances  Claude's name can be seen in a grafitti as an easter egg in Grand Theft Auto IV. The grafitti contains numerous \\"RIP\\" messages, which implies that Claude is dead, though Rockstar later clarified it was a joke. Furthermore, Claude's outfit can be unlocked in the game, if the player gains access to a specific safehouse. In Grand Theft Auto Online, players can choose what their character looks like by selecting between different parents; Claude is one of the special parents available, meaning that players can select him so that their character has a level of resemblance to him. An image of Claude is displayed in high definition. Reception The character was well received. Including him in their list of \\"Grand Theft Auto Favorite Badasses\\", IGN stated that \\"the argument is often made that silent characters are easier for the player to identify with. That's certainly true in the case of Claude.\\" CraveOnline placed Claude eighth on their \\"Top 10 Most Memorable GTA Characters\\" as \\"the face of a video game that inarguably changed the shape of the industry forever\\".

The former Molfetta Cathedral, now renamed church of Saint Conrad of Bavaria, is dedicated to him, and he is also the patron saint of Molfetta, although formally speaking he was beatified rather than canonised. Life There are several different versions of the life of Conrad. The common elements are that he was born in the castle of Ravensburg in Swabia (or Regensburg in Bavaria), a younger son of Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria, a member of the Italian Welf-Este family. Through the marriage of his sister Judith he was the uncle of Frederick Barbarossa. (He is sometimes named as Henry's second son, sometimes as the third, sometimes as the youngest). After some time spent with the monks of Weingarten Abbey, a Welf family monastery, he studied theology in Cologne under the protection of his relative, the Archbishop Frederick I, with the intention, on the part of his family, that he should eventually succeed to the archbishopric. While at Cologne however he became a disciple of Bernard of Clairvaux and entered the Cistercian Order, taking his vows at Clairvaux and joining the community there as a monk. He then journeyed, or intended to journey, to the Holy Land (although not as a part of the crusades) with the purpose of living there as a hermit, but either never left Europe or was obliged to return to it. Passing through Apulia (in whichever direction) he stopped at Modugno near Bari, where he lived as a hermit either in a cave near the grotto of the sanctuary or in a small Benedictine abbey nearby, where he died. According to sources which favour a death in 1126, he was drawn to the Cistercians by the preaching in Cologne of Arnold the German, abbot of Morimond, rather than of Bernard himself, and took his vows at Morimond rather than at Clairvaux, although the latter is often given. His journey to the Holy Land was in the context of Arnold's endeavour to establish a Cistercian monastery there, which incurred the disapproval of Saint Bernard, who tried to prevent it. In the event Arnold died, in 1125, which put an end to it. Conrad nevertheless continued alone, hoping to become a hermit in the Holy Land, but when he reached Apulia, instead of embarking, he settled in a cave near the grotto shrine of Santa Maria ad Cryptam (as above), living, praying and sleeping on bare rock, and before he died in 1126, had gained a local following by virtue of his holiness of life. Those in favour of a death in 1154 (or 1155) add extra years spent either as a monk at Clairvaux or as a hermit either in the Holy Land or by the grotto at Modugno. According to some, Conrad accompanied King Conrad to the Holy Land in 1147 on the Second Crusade, returning in the same year but after some time in Clairvaux travelled back to the Holy Land in 1151 with Bernard's permission to live as a hermit; his return to Europe is dated to 1153, caused by the news that Bernard had fallen ill. His relics were preserved in the old Molfetta Cathedral, which was dedicated to him and is still in existence as the Church of San Corrado. They were translated to the new cathedral after its restoration in 1785. His local cultus was confirmed on 7 April 1832Date of beatification, accessed 14 September 2012 by his beatification by Pope Gregory XVI.Entry No.6 for 17 March in the Florilegium Martyrologii Romani in the √ñkumenisches Heiligenlexikon Nevertheless, he is commonly referred to as a saint. In the Cistercian Order his feast is celebrated on 9 February.http://www.ocist.net/liturgy/public/Directori%202009.pdf Director of the Cistercian Order The feast of San Corrado is celebrated annually in Molfetta by a procession that carries the skull of the saint in a silver reliquary round the town.The connection of the saint with Molfetta was marked in July 2013 when the Federazione Molfettesi d'America presented a statue of Saint Conrad (sculpted by Nicolo Scardigno) to the Holy Face Monastery in Clifton, NJ - see NorthJersey.com: article  Sources  * Walter Troxler (1992): \\"Konrad von Bayern\\".

AS HIPPIE-PUNKS) is a 1995 live album by the band Die Engel des Herrn. It was recorded at a 1993 concert in D√ºsseldorf which was the band's final performance, as they split up immediately following the concert. When Klaus Dinger signed to the Japanese record label \\"Captain Trip Records\\" in 1995, the recording was made into a live album and released (bearing the same \\"L.S.D.\\" imprint as the band's debut album although being marketed only by Captain Trip). Concert Following a succession of personal tragedies related to the band (including the deaths of Dinger's father and Klaus Immig's son) and their failure to secure the support of a major record label, the decision was made to split up. The three band members organised a final concert at Malkasten in D√ºsseldorf, in which they were supported by bass guitarist and double bassist Konstantin Wienstroer and slide guitarist Dirk Flader. The set list includes a mixture of songs from Die Engel des Herrn's debut album and the La D√ºsseldorf album Viva. The D.E.D.H. songs differ greatly from their studio versions; three are exclusive to this album. The version of \\"Cha Cha 2000\\" on the album is notable for its free-form middle section, featuring Wienstroer's double bass as well as a variety of tuned percussion instruments.

The bill would make religious organizations and religious non-profits eligible to receive federal funding for repairs and rebuilding of their facilities after a major disaster. The bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The bill passed the House by a large margin, but was criticized by opponents for using taxpayer money to help tax-exempt organizations and for violating the principle of separation of church and state. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Bill would amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to include community centers, including tax-exempt houses of worship, as \\"private nonprofit facilities\\" for purposes of disaster relief and emergency assistance eligibility under such Act. The amendment makes a church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or other house of worship, and a private nonprofit facility operated by a religious organization, eligible for federal contributions for the repair, restoration, and replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed by a major disaster, without regard to the religious character of the facility or the primary religious use of the facility. Finally, the bill makes the Act applicable to the provision of assistance in response to a major disaster or emergency declared on or after October 28, 2012. Procedural history House The Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on February 8, 2013 by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ). The bill was immediately referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was then referred to the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management on February 11, 2013. On February 13, the Bill was considered on the House floor under a suspension of the rules; it passed later that day 354-72 (Roll Call Vote 39). By the time it had passed, the Bill had received 9 cosponsors in the House. Of the 72 members who voted against the bill, 66 were Democrats and 6 were Republicans. Senate The Bill was received in the Senate on February 14, 2013. It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on March 13, 2013. Debate Supporters of the Bill argued that the bill was necessary to clarify existing law by correcting an oversight. The House Republican Majority's official website stated their view that \\"unlike previous disasters, Congress did not clarify that religious nonprofits, including houses of worship, are eligible to receive disaster funding when providing aid for victims and communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy. As a result, the (Obama) Administration is interpreting current law to preclude houses of worship from being eligible for funding on the same terms as similarly impacted nonprofits.\\" Other supporters of federal funding for houses of worship damaged in disasters have argued that such places a key parts of communities and are not exempted from other aspects of government disaster management, like evacuation orders or emergency fortification attempts, and therefore should not be prevented from seeking disaster relief. Opponents of the Bill argued that the Obama Administration is right to deny funds to religious institutions; this argument was often made on First Amendment grounds. The non-profit Center for Inquiry wrote on its website that they opposed the Bill because they believed it violated the First Amendment's prohibition against government establishing any religion. The Center for Inquiry argued that \\"true religious freedom protects the conscience of the taxpayer by ensuring that his or her money is not used to support or advance religion with which he or she may disagree.\\" One blogger referred to the act as the \\"Taxpayer Money to Tax-Exempt Churches Act\\". The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State also argued against the Bill, writing on their website that \\"Church-state separation protects the right of taxpayers to support only the religious institutions of their choice, and it ensures the independence and integrity of faith communities. Houses of worship exist primarily to teach the tenets of their religion. They should be supported by donations, not government subsidies.\\" See also *Emergency management *Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act *Separation of church and state in the United States *501(c) organization Notes/References External links *Library of Congress H.R. 592 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 592 *GovTrack.us H.R. 592 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 592 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 592 *House Roll Call Vote #39 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Disaster management Category:Disaster preparedness in North America ","title":"Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act of 2013"},{"id":"39117807","text":"thumb The Ostpark is a public park in Munich, Germany.

The history of Lettre International dates back to 1984, the year that the original French edition (Lettre Internationale) first came out. Publication of the French magazine ceased in 1993. The corresponding German Lettre International, founded by Frank Berberich, has come out continuously since its inception in 1988. History The original French edition was founded by Czech writer and scholar Anton√≠n Jaroslav Liehm in Paris, 1984. This was followed by the establishment of an Italian edition, Lettera Internazionale (1985) and a Spanish one, Letra Internacional (1986). The German Lettre International was founded in 1988. Shortly after the upheavals of 1989, intellectuals in Central and Eastern Europe joined the project and established editions of Lettre International in their respective languages. At most, Lettre International came out in twelve different versions at once, but some editions eventually ceased publication due to financial constraints and other circumstances. The French Lettre Internationale ceased publication in 1993. Lettre currently appears in German, Italian, Spanish, Hungarian, Romanian and, occasionally, in Danish language editions. Lettre International, Berlin In 1988, the German Lettre International was founded in Berlin, by chief editor Frank Berberich. To begin with, Lettre International was published in cooperation with the Berlin daily newspaper, Die Tageszeitung, but has since the mid-1990 been the property of the independent Lettre International publishing company. The German edition comes out four times a year, with a circulation of 20,000 copies. Each issue of the German edition is printed in tabloid format, roughly 10.6 inches wide by 14.6 inches tall. Every issue features 30 to 40 texts by different authors, the majority of which are translations, all of them first appearances in German. For each issue, Lettre International recruits a single visual artist to design the title page and up to ten pages of the magazine's middle section. Each issue also presents a freestanding six to eight page photo portfolio, consisting of a photo report, conceptual or essayistic photography. Special issues Issue 1, published in 1988, was printed and distributed in 100,000 copies. Issue 31, published in winter 1995, was dedicated to the ongoing siege of Sarajevo, and titled Hommage √† Sarajevo. The issue, which featured contributions from Jean Baudrillard, Susan Sontag and Heiner M√ºller, among 46 other authors, appeared in German and Serbo-Croatian simultaneously. The issue featured artworks from twelve artists, including Sophie Calle, Rebecca Horn, Annie Leibovitz and Lawrence Weiner. Issue 81, published in summer 2008, is a 250 page long double-issue, featuring artworks and photography from 85 artists and written contributions from over 50 authors, celebrating the German edition's 20th anniversary. The issue was titled So Leben Wir Jetzt, featuring cover-artwork from Georg Baselitz. Issue 86, published in autumn 2009, was titled Berlin auf der Couch or Berlin on the Couch, featuring Ewa Einhorn's drawing Bear as cover art. The main theme of the issue was Germany's capital and its development, culturally and otherwise, since the 1989 end of the Berlin wall. Among contributors to this issue were Boris Groys, Iain Sinclair, Jacques Rupnik, Angelo Bolaffi, Michail Ryklin, Wolfgang M√ºller, Sylv√®re Lotringer, Eliot Weinberger, Svetlana Alexievich and V√°clav Bƒõlohradsk√Ω. An interview in issue 86, with politician and writer Thilo Sarrazin, in which he expressed a strong anti-immigration and anti-Muslim disposition, caused a furore in the German media. In March 2013, Lettre International celebrated its 25th anniversary with issue 100, featuring artworks and photography from 36 artists, including Max Gr√ºter, Lawrence Weiner and Daniel Richter. The issue's title stems from Max Gr√ºter's cover artwork: Niveau sans frontieres. Lettre Ulysses Award In 2003-2006, the German edition of Lettre International initiated and organized the Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage, in partnership with the Aventis foundation and in cooperation with the Goethe- institute. It was the first world prize in the genre of literary reportage.

It uses the Cortex Plus system. The first volume was published in early 2012. In early 2013. Margaret Weis Productions announced that they would not be renewing their license. Gameplay The game was designed to be fast playing and easy to use and run and very flexible, and designed explicitly for Troupe Play in which the players are expected to pick up new characters between action scenes (or occasionally within them).Why Marvel Heroic Roleplay plays so uniquely with designer Cam Banks - ENWorld interview with Cam Banks It has also been described as \\"a \\"comic book story\\" roleplaying game, not a \\"superhero\\" game as is common with many other games of this type\\".RPG.Net Review Unusually for a role playing game, players are expected to know the capabilities of their characters and their stats do not explicitly restrict what they can do, merely resolving what happens when a player acts. Setting Marvel Heroic Roleplaying is set in the Marvel Universe. In particular, the line was intended to be \\"event driven\\", with each major book in the line dealing with a separate famous story arc of the Marvel Universe and allowing players to reshape it. The initial Basic Set contains an adventure that reproduces the opening \\"Breakout\\" arc of the New Avengers,New Avengers Volume 1: Breakout Trade Paperback - Marvel Website and two other major events were released‚ÄîCivil War as a hardback, and Annihilation in PDF only. A third event planned to be the Age of Apocalypse was never released. Each \\"Event Book\\" was available in a Premium Edition which included the rules as well as the event as well as an Essentials Edition, which assumed you also owned the rules and didn't need them in this book. System Marvel Heroic Roleplaying is one of the examples of the Cortex Plus system, and, like most games in that system, it uses a Roll-and-Keep method, with each die representing something that would be notable in the setting and story that is being told. In order to affect the game above the normal limits, the players get Plot Points, and the GM (known as The Watcher) gets the Doom Pool. Every time any die rolls a 1, that is called an Opportunity, and, if a player rolls a 1, the Watcher may either add a d6 to the Doom Pool or step up a die (and may do this multiple times on multiple 1s in the pool). Dice dependent on the PC that may be included are: * One Distinction either as a d8 or a d4 keeping a plot point. * One Affiliation (Solo/Buddy/Team): who the character is with. Some people work better on their own, and some in teams. PCs have one at d10, one at d8, and one at d6. * Power Sets (which may be heavily modified by Sfx or limits). One die per power set by default. * One Specialty: a mix of skills, knowledge, and contacts. Experts are rated d8, and Masters d10. Specialties are Acrobatics, Combat, Covert, Medical, Menace, Mystic, Psych, Science, Tech, and Vehicle. Most characters hold no ranks in most specialties. A d10 specialty may be replaced by 2d8 or 3d6 and a d8 specialty may be replaced by 2d6 Dice dependent on the prior actions that may be included are: * One asset: an object or situational advantage created within the scene * One resource: a pre-planned advantage created in a transition scene, and one step smaller than the speciality that created it. * One die from Stress (i.e. Harm) or a complication (i.e. a temporary impediment) affecting your opponent Plot Points The player characters can use Plot Points for several purposes. * To power their abilities as listed under their Sfx in their power sets * To add an extra dice to the dice pool * To keep an extra dice‚Äîeither to their result total or as an extra effect dice. * To change a form of incoming stress from one type to another. The Doom Pool As a rule the Doom Pool can be used to do anything a plot point can other than change a type of stress but the dice affected must be of equal or lower size to the dice spent out of the Doom Pool. There are also two additional functions. * To activate reinforcements * 2d12 may be spent from the Doom Pool to immediately end a scene. Reception Reception of Marvel Heroic Roleplaying was mixed, with significant critical acclaim including winning both Origins Awards for 2013, but criticisms being made of the free-form nature of the gameplay, the layout, and the lack of character creation rules.Character creation rules are in the core rulebook under \\"Creating New Datafiles\\" on page OM110.

He is best known for his project \\"Poietic Generator\\" and for having introduced the concept of \\"Digital Perspective\\" in the fields of network theory, art and digital humanities. Biography Olivier Auber was born in 1960 in Sainte- Adresse in Normandy, France. He lives and works in Paris and Brussels. He holds an engineering degree and a Master of Design from the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Arts et M√©tiers. His engineering thesis focused on nonlinear optical elements (holograms) for avionics (head-up display). This initial specialization in optics has earned him early in his career as a research engineer, first in the avionics division of Thomson Csf (now Thales Group) and at CERN in Geneva. In 1984, he takes the status of independent consulting engineer for the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie (Paris), then under construction, to work first on the development of exhibits, then quickly as project manager responsible for the design and development of several permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, between 1984 and 1996, he designed the scenario and led the implementation of several highly technological exhibitions and media on science issues as diverse as: the sun, mathematics, electricity, symmetry in the arts and science, non-verbal human behavior, etc. In this period, he also developed some exhibition projects for other cultural institutions, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Institut du Monde Arabe, the Palais de la D√©couverte. The creation for the \\"Expressions et behaviours\\" exhibition inaugurated in early 1987, marked a milestone in his career, leading him from a predominantly scientific and technical culture to another more artistic and open to all components of the humanities. End of 1987, while working with Tod Machover (MIT Medialab) and Catherine Ikam (artist) for the staging of VALIS, a contemporary music opera based on the work of Philip K. Dick, he designed what would become his best known work, the \\"Poietic Generator\\", a free social artwork for all that can be played in real time over a network. In 1988, this work became the central concept of a monumental, architectural and technological project, one of the seven laureates of the international competition for the creation of the \\"France- Japan Monument\\" on Awaji Island in the Bay of Kobe, launched under the aegis of Fran√ßois Mitterrand. This Monument never saw the daylight, but its various implementations were exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou (exhibition \\"Communication et Monumentalit√©\\", 1989), the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie (exhibition \\"Machines √† communiquer\\", 1994) and in various galleries and art events including ARSLAB in 1995, where Olivier Auber was awarded the prize \\"art and science\\" by the city of Turin, Italy. The exhibition \\"ARSLAB - The senses of virtuality\\", sponsored by the City of Turin - Promoter of Fine Arts, was organized by Ars Technica and Extramuseum and was curated by Claude Faure, Maria Grazia Mattei and Franco Torriani 1998, Arslab. I labirinti del corpo in gioco. published by hopefulmonster, Turin, Italy. In 1995 still, he was invited to the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des T√©l√©communications (now T√©l√©com ParisTech) to develop his project, not just on the web, but on an experimental network foreshadowing the future shape of the Internet (Mbone) which allowed him to perform what is considered as the first experience of real-time collective interaction over the Internet without the intermediary of any center. In 1996, he developed a version of Poietic Generator for the web in order to let every one access to it. Several experiments followed through electronic art festivals and academic research: Ljubljana (1998), X-00 (2000), Human-Computer Interaction Conference IHM- UTC(2002, L3D Lab, University of Colorado at Boulder in (2002), and so on. In 1997 he co-founded the A+H Culture Laboratory, with Bernd Hoge (architect and urban planner), Emmanuel M√¢a Berriet (developer of virtual reality) and Philippe Braunstein (film producer), in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. One of the first is the creation of the Nibelungen Museum in Worms Germany. One of the pieces in the museum, the virtual reality installation \\"The treasure of the Nibelungs\\", inspired by the Poietic Generator, was also exhibited in numerous festivals, including ISEA 2000 (Paris) and Boston CyberArts 2001. In 2002, he co-founded with Nils Aziosmanoff and Etienne Krieger the company NavidisNavidis, innovative solutions to the Smart Cities which brings innovative solutions to the Smart City users. In 2004, he co- founded with visual artist Yann Le Guennec the research group Anoptique that developed dataviz experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects in partnership with the Fondation Internet Nouvelle G√©n√©ration (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&D; and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data. In 2010 and 2011, he contributed to the creation of a transdisciplinary Research ChairResearch Chair \\"modeling imaginary\\" at Telecom ParisTech devoted to \\"modeling imaginary\\" with the help of Dassault Syst√®mes, Ubisoft, Orange Lab, Peugeot-Citroen, Alcatel Lucent, BNP Paribas, Datar and Minatec. Since 2012, Olivier Auber divides his time between consultancy, design of cultural and art projects, and research and development on the Poietic Generator. He also contributes to many working groups, as a research associate of the transdisciplinary research group \\"Evolution, Complexity and Cognition\\"Research group on \\"Evolution, Complexity and Cognition (ECCO)\\" and the Global Brain InstituteGlobal Brain Institute\\" directed by Francis Heylighen, and as an active member of the P2P Foundation. Theoretical arguments From 1986, Olivier Auber theorized the Poietic Generator as an experience of two new kinds of perspectives, analogous to the spatial perspective of the Renaissance: the \\"temporal perspective\\" and the \\"digital perspective\\", on which he wrote several papersOlivier Auber : Du G√©n√©rateur po√Ø√©tique √† la perspective num√©rique, Revue d'esth√©tique 43 - 07/2003 - p. 127, online on Arch√©e, Qu√©bec, \\"The Aestetic of the Digital Perspective\\", Artmedia VIII, Paris, 2002 (arts.ucla.edu) whose terms were continued in the works of many philosophers and historians of art and science, including Anne Cauquelin,Anne Cauquelin: Fr√©quenter les incorporels, PUF, collection ¬´ Lignes d'art ¬ª, 2006.

The book is 128 pages long and divided into six chapters; it is composed of small, medium, and large panels, and often features pages of full artwork. It features an immigrant's life in an imaginary world that sometimes vaguely resembles our own. Without the use of dialogue or text, Shaun Tan portrays the experience of a father emigrating to a new land. Tan differentiates The Arrival from children's picture books, explaining that there's more emphasis on continuity in texts with multiple frames and panels, and that a \\"graphic novel\\" text like his more closely resembles a film making process. Shaun Tan has said he wanted his book to build a kind of empathy in readers: \\"In Australia, people don't stop to imagine what it's like for some of these refugees. They just see them as a problem once they're here, without thinking about the bigger picture. I don't expect the book to change anybody's opinion about things, but if it at least makes them pause to think, I'll feel as if I've succeeded in something.\\"  Synopsis  The Arrival tells a universal story of immigration. The story is about a man leaving his home to find work and support his family, whose home has apparently become unsafe. In the new land, the man goes through a lengthy administrative process and manages to find a small living space. Although he struggles to understand the different language, navigate the unknown city and to find a secure job, he makes new friends of the locals and learns of the struggles of other refugees that have fled their homes due to slavery and sought asylum from war, sharing his own experiences as well. Eventually, the man‚Äôs family joins him in the new land, and they settle into a new, happy life. The \\"graphic novel\\" conveys messages of solitude, alienation, and hope in a foreign land.  Style  Shaun Tan sets the mood of each scene with sepia-tone colour schemes, ranging from grayscale to bright gold. The illustrations are reminiscent of aged photos, and often feature realistic- looking humans in abstract and bizarre environments. The environments resemble a combination of futuristic and old-fashioned aesthetics. Tan's process was one that used real-life models to create a storyboard. He also shot pictures in his garage, using a video camera and empty boxes to create lighting. Shaun Tan has commented on the reason for this process: \\"I was very dependent on photography for a lot of the drawings, because they're photo-realistic. It's not my favorite style of working, and I didn't feel very confident. The other thing was continuity. When I started, I was drawing everything out of my head by hand, and I was finding that there were accumulating continuity problems‚Äîjust little things that you notice subconsciously, like the length of a sleeve, how a lapel falls, where the rim of a hat is. The only way to register all of that properly was to photograph a lot of the stuff.\\" Shaun Tan has commented that he was influenced by The Snowman by Raymond Briggs.

The group formed in 1998 in Madrid and are known for their sci-fi and space influenced imagery, lyrics and sound. The band has released three full-length albums to date. History In the beginning, the first line-up was: J. Oliver (guitar), Dani (guitar), Guillemoth (bass), Andy C. (drums). After a few months the band contacted with Phlegeton the official vocalist of Wormed. Phlegeton gives fresh air to the band transforming the band concept from the classical gore to another concept, based in the outer space far from imagination. The music turned into an atypical Death metal full of diverse influences. In December 1999, the first MCD demo was recorded, Floating Cadaver in the Monochrome, with the collaboration of Tana Avulsed as sound engineer. This MCD had a great welcome in the underground scene, selling more than 1500 copies all over the world. There are actually 3 different editions of the MCD, with different CD layer design. In 2001, the band returned to the studio to record a Promo-CD, Voxel Mitosis, including a single song, due to the lack of resources. Despite this, the sound is more professional than the MCD. After the recording the promo-CD, Dani left Wormed, because the lack of compromise with the band. Wormed became a 4 members band being: Phlegeton (vocals), J. Oliver (guitar), Guillemoth (bass) and Andy C. (drums). The band received international recognition playing in some festivals and concerts worldwide, giving the band a name in the local and international scene, with a great response of the underground audience. In 2003, the band released their first full album Planisphaerium, through Macabre Mementos Recs. (Japan), including 7 tracks, recorded in VST Studios from Madrid. In December 2003, J. Oliver left the band, so Wormed looked for a replacement to J. Oliver, they found Charly, guitar player from Wormineye, a Death Metal band from Valencia. In 2004‚Äì2006, the band played in international metal festivals in USA, Japan, Germany, Holland; and they made a Japan tour with Goratory (USA) and Vomit Remnants (Japan), later they made another tour with Malignancy (USA) and Despondency (Germany) around Europe. After a period of inactivity, the band started writing again with J.Oliver and this time with Phlegeton at the drums. Later they recruited Migueloud of the Spanish Death metal band Human Mincer as the second guitarist. In 2010 the band released the single Quasineutrality through the Spanish label Pathologically Explicit Recordings and soon after in 2012 they released the album Planisphaerium and the single Quasineutrality was edited through the North American label Willowtip Records including bonus tracks and re-mastered audio by Delta314 Sound Studio. Considering the possibility of start playing live again, the band decided to recruit a new drummer, Ricardo Mena, Riky (from the Spanish Death Metal band Avulsed). In March 2013 their new album Exodromos was released. The album was recorded at Sadman Studios in Madrid by Carlos Santos and mastered by Mika Jussila (Amorphis, Impaled Nazarene, Children of Bodom, Nightwish...) at the famous Finnvox Studios, Helsinki, Finland. Exodromos is released through Willowtip Records in USA and Hammerheart Records in Europe. Lyrically, Exodromos is a prequel of Planisphaerium; the story tells about futuristic science concepts and chaotic visions of the last human left in cosmos, Krighsu. These are particularly in relation to the awakening of the \\"Chrym\\" once the last humans of the year 8K, called the Terrax, disappeared, and the known universe was absorbed by a quantum wormhole in an inverted multi-vectorial reionization. Krighsu, will travel through xenoverses to found a new world with the human seed. Wormed released a statement on 13 March 2018 that their drummer Guillermo Calero had died, with the cause of death not being disclosed. Calero played in Wormed from 2014 until his death and performed on their third full-length album Krighsu (which was released on 16 March 2016).

Headquartered in Bern, Switzerland, the company employs some 500 people worldwide and operates in over 70 countries. In its history, Bernafon has achieved many industry milestones and successes, including the world's first digitally programmable hearing instrument an ChannelFree‚Ñ¢ signal processing. In 2017, the new DECS‚Ñ¢ technology platform was introduced.  Corporate History  The story of Bernafon began in 1946, at what was then Gfeller AG, a telephone and telephone system company outside Bern, Switzerland. There were two main reasons for the compoany to enter the hearing instrument business. Shortly after the end of Second World War, management wanted to expand the range of its products, and the head of the company, Hans Gfeller, was himself severely hearing-impaired. As a result, hans Gfleller's son and one of his fellow students started building their own hearing instruments. The first model, completed in 1946, saw the device and its battery housed in two separate leather cases. It was therefore given the name A1 2-Pack. The device was soon in demand and hearing instruments rapidly became an integral part of Gfeller's product range. In 1987, Gfeller AG merged with Autophon, Hasler and Zellweger Telecommunications to form the Ascom group. This group employed a total of 14,000 workers and was ranked eleventh among the world's telecommunication firms. A further expansion took place in 1992 with the takeover of the hearing instrument activities of the German firm Robert Bosch GmbH. The integration of Bosch‚Äôs hearing instrument activities and the simultaneous creation of a production line in Australia proved too great a challenge for the relatively small company. The 1995 takeover of Bernafon by William Demant resulted in the opening of new sales companies and expansion of the product offering. In 2016 Bernafon celebrated its 70th anniversary in the hearing aid industry.

Together with William Leveson, he was one of two trustees used by the original shareholders of the Globe Theatre in the allocation of their shares in 1599. He was an associate of the actor and editor of the First Folio, John Heminges, and of John Jackson, both of whom were Shakespeare's trustees in the purchase of the Blackfriars Gatehouse. Savage amassed a considerable fortune, at the time of his death owning five houses in London and an inn called the George. Family Thomas Savage, born about 1552 in Rufford, Lancashire,. was the son of Jeffry or Geoffrey Savage and Jenett or Janet Hesketh, who according to the parish register were married in the church at Croston on 9 August 1551.. Savage may have had a younger brother, Peter Savage, and had at least one sister,. as well as a female cousin, the widow of Thomas Hesketh of Rufford. Career At some time Savage moved to London, where he lived from about 1580 until his death in 1611 in the parish of St Albans Wood Street. At an unknown date he gained admission to the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. The Company records are missing for the date of his admission; however surviving Company records indicate that he took on nine apprentices from the 1580s until his death, and that his son, Richard, was taken on as an apprentice in 1601. According to Hotson, however, he 'no doubt gained most of his income from his office as one of the ten seacoal-meters of London'. officials appointed to measure coal brought into the port of London by sea.. According to Hotson, he was a 'man of substance', and Honigmann notes that, 'starting with nothing', he 'amassed a very considerable fortune'.. At the time of his death Savage owned at least five houses in the City of London, one of which was occupied by the actor and editor of the First Folio, John Heminges (bap. 1566, d.1630), also one of London's seacoal-meters, from whom Savage had purchased it. Another of the houses owned by Savage was in the parish of St Olave Silver Street;.

Christopher Mountjoy. After Savage's death, his son, Richard, sold the latter house to John Heminges. Savage also owned an inn called the George in the parish of St Sepulchre, London.. In 1599 Savage, together with William Leveson, was one of two trustees used by William Kempe, Thomas Pope (d.1603), Augustine Phillips (d.1605), John Heminges and William Shakespeare to allocate shareholdings in the Globe Theatre. Savage was a friend of John Jackson (c.1574‚Äì1625) gentleman, of Kingston upon Hull and London, whom Heminges had taken as his deputy in the office of seacoal-meter soon after December 1608..Heminges was admitted as one of London's ten seacoal-meters on 13 December 1608; . Both Jackson and Heminges were later Shakespeare's trustees in the purchase of the Blackfriars Gatehouse in March 1613.; . In his will Savage appointed his 'very loving friend, John Jackson', as overseer.. Savage made his last will on 3 October 1611, leaving, among other bequests, ¬£10 to his mother, Janet, a silver spout pot and ¬£8 for a dinner to his fellow members of the Goldsmiths' Company, and forty shillings to the poor of his birthplace, Rufford, in the parish of Croston. According to Honigmann, the opening lines of Savage's will suggest that he held strong religious convictions, and his bequests to the parson and churchwardens of his parish of St Albans, Wood Street were 'unusually generous'. The will was proved 26 October 1611.Will of Thomas Savage, goldsmith of London, proved 26 October 1611, National Archives Retrieved 15 April 2013. Marriages and issue Savage married two wives and had five children.. One of his wives, Alice, had four children by her own two previous marriages, as revealed in a bill of complaint dated 10 September 1605.

The variety was created in 1976 at the VSSVVM Research and Breeding Station for Enology and Viticulture in Modra. The grape was named after the Rimava river, a tributary of the Saj√≥. Along with Nitranka, Hron and V√°h, which were created using the same parent varieties, Rimava was officially authorized for commercial wine production in 2011.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J.

Rimava is a mid to late budding and ripening grape variety that tends to produce very small berries but can be highly productive and high yielding. While the vine has good resistance to spring time frost due to its late budding nature, it is not very winter hardy and the vine can be seriously damaged by hard winter frosts. Being planted on poorer vineyard soils will limit some of Rimava vigor. Wine regions Rimava is currently found in the Malokarpatsk√° (blue) and Ju≈ænoslovensk√° (salmon pink) wine regions of southwest Slovakia. Being only officially authorized for wine production since 2011, Rimava is not yet widely planted in Slovakia with 3 hectares (7 acres) of the grape planted in 2011. It is currently found in the Ju≈ænoslovensk√° and Malokarpatsk√° wine regions of southwest Slovakia. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, well made examples of Rimava from favorable vintages can be the most Cabernet Sauvignon-like of all the Abouriou x Castets crossings. The grape has the potential to produce full-bodied and deeply colored wines with the ability to age and improve further in the bottle.

Khalil is known as \\"the Mountain\\" () because of his height. Khalil started his senior career in Sierra Leone at Johansen, before moving to Sweden in 2011, first playing at Koping FF before transferring to Djurg√•rden. Following his experience in Sweden, Khalil moved back to his native country, at Kallon, before joining Lebanese club Safa in 2013. After spending four years at the club, Khalil moved to Lebanese Premier League reigning champions Ahed in 2017. He won the 2019 AFC Cup with the side, the first in Lebanese history, as the competition's Most Valuable Player. In 2020, Khalil moved to Iranian side Zob Ahan on a six-month loan. Khalil represented Lebanon at the 2019 AFC Asian Cup as their main goalkeeper, playing in all three group stage games. With 40 international caps, Khalil is Lebanon's joint most-capped goalkeeper, alongside Ziad Al Samad.  Early life  Born in Sierra Leone to Lebanese parents, Khalil started playing six-a-side football, a popular form of football in Sierra Leone, at age 12 at Young Sportsmen Club as a defender. Noticing his physical attributes, namely his height, Khalil's coach advised him to switch position to goalkeeper. At age 15, he moved to Johansen to play football.  Club career   2009‚Äì2012: Sierra Leone and Sweden  Khalil began his senior career in Sierra Leone in 2009 at Johansen, a club founded by Norwegian couple Isha and Arne Johansen. In 2010, Khalil played for Kallon U19 at the Viareggio Cup, an annual youth tournament held in Italy; he played in two of the three games. Thanks to his Scandinavian connections, in March 2011 Khalil joined Swedish Division 3 side K√∂ping FF on a three-month loan. Talking about his first training session at the club, Khalil said that \\"[it] was fun [...] the guys seem lovely, and many of them are young, just like me\\". He played seven games for the club. Between April and June 2011, Khalil trained with Allsvenskan clubs AIK and Trelleborg. On 20 July 2011, Khalil moved to Djurg√•rden, AIK's rivals, on a four-month loan. He had been noticed by the club's manager Magnus Pehrsson the previous year at a friendly tournament in Ghana; Khalil was named best goalkeeper of the tournament. On 1 August 2011, he made his debut for the club's under-21 team in the against Brage, helping his side win 5‚Äì1. On 25 October 2011, Djurg√•rden announced that Khalil's contract would not be renewed. Following his experience in Sweden, Khalil moved back to his native Sierra Leone, playing for Kallon during the 2011‚Äì12 season.  2013‚Äì2017: Safa  Through his links with Roda Antar, a Sierra Leonean-born Lebanese footballer, Khalil moved to Safa in the Lebanese Premier League in January 2013. He signed a three-and-a-half-year contract in a deal worth $20,000. Initially a reserve for Ziad Al Samad, Khalil became Safa's first choice goalkeeper from his third season at the club. Khalil did not play in the league in his first season (2012‚Äì13). His debut came during the 2013 AFC Cup, playing in a group stage game against Riffa on 2 April 2013; the match ended in a 1‚Äì0 win. On 24 April 2013, Khalil was sent off against Regar- TadAZ in the 79th minute, with the opposing team scoring from the subsequent penalty kick. However, Safa still won the encounter 3‚Äì2 through a 92nd-minute goal by Mohamad Haidar. In Khalil's first experience in the AFC Cup he played three matches, finishing third in the group. Khalil's league debut came in the 2013‚Äì14 season, on 23 November 2013, in a 5‚Äì0 win over Tadamon Sour. He participated in the 2014 AFC Cup, playing two games. Khalil became the club's starter from the 2014‚Äì15 season, playing 17 league games. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, Khalil played 16 league games, helping Safa win their second league title. He was included in the 2015‚Äì16 Lebanese Premier League Team of the Season for his performances. Following the expiration of his contract in mid-2016, Khalil tried out with several Eerste Divisie teams in the Netherlands. He remained with Safa for one more year, playing 16 games in the league during the 2016‚Äì17 season. He also made two appearances in the 2017 AFC Cup. In five seasons at the Beirut-based club, Khalil won two league titles (2012‚Äì13 and 2015‚Äì16), one FA Cup (2013‚Äì14), and one Super Cup (2013).  2017‚Äì2020: Ahed  Khalil with Ahed in 2019 In July 2017, Khalil moved to Lebanese Premier League holders Ahed, for a fee of around $250,000. Khalil quickly asserted himself as the team's first-choice goalkeeper, playing 18 league games in the 2017‚Äì18 season. He helped his team win the domestic treble‚Äîthe league title, cup, and Super Cup. Khalil was Ahed's goalkeeper at the 2018 AFC Cup, playing eight games and reaching the zonal semi-finals, where they lost to Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya 5‚Äì3 on aggregate. In his first season at the club, Khalil was included in the 2017‚Äì18 Lebanese Premier League Team of the Season as the league's best goalkeeper. His next season with the team was also successful, as he won his second domestic treble. He played 21 league games in the 2018‚Äì19 season. Khalil featured in the 2018‚Äì19 Lebanese Premier League Team of the Season. On 4 November 2019, after beating April 25 in the final, he won the 2019 AFC Cup as the competition's Most Valuable Player. Conceding just three goals in 11 matches, Khalil kept nine clean sheets (of which five were consecutive in the knock-out stages) as Ahed went unbeaten throughout the whole tournament. The 2019 AFC Cup win was the first for a Lebanese club.  2020: Loan to Zob Ahan  Khalil celebrating with his teammates at Zob Ahan in 2020 On 7 January 2020, Khalil joined Persian Gulf Pro League side Zob Ahan on a six-month loan, reuniting him with former Lebanon national team coach Miodrag Raduloviƒá. He cited the conditions in his country and the ambiguity surrounding the resumption of sports activity as the reasons for the transfer. Khalil became the fourth Lebanese player to play for the Iranian side, after Walid Ismail, Ali Hamam, and Rabih Ataya. He made his league debut for Zob Ahan on 25 January 2020 against Pars Jonoubi Jam; despite being booked in the 64th minute, Khalil kept a clean sheet, helping his side win 1‚Äì0 at home. In Khalil's third game, on 7 February 2020, he again kept a 1‚Äì0 clean sheet against Sanat Naft, while being booked in the 89th minute. Thanks to his performances in the two fixtures, Khalil was included in the Team of the Week on both occasions. Khalil finished the 2019‚Äì20 season with eight games.  2020-present: Return to Ahed  Despite Zob Ahan extending Khalil's loan for an additional year on 27 June 2020, Khalil returned back to Ahed as their first-choice goalkeeper. In the first matchday of the 2020‚Äì21 season on 4 October 2020, he helped Ahed win 3‚Äì2 over Bourj. International career Born in Sierra Leone, Khalil was called up for his native country at the under-17 and under-20 levels, however he did not feature in any match. Eligible to represent Lebanon through his parents' nationality, Khalil opted to play for Lebanon's senior team in 2013. South Korean forward Son Heung-min in 2019 Khalil made his debut for Lebanon in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Bahrain on 17 March 2013. He was part of the squad that played in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers between 2015 and 2016; initially Abbas Hassan's reserve for the first three matches, Khalil became Lebanon's first-choice goalkeeper in the final five games of the second round of qualification. Lebanon finished in second place in their group and, despite being eliminated from the World Cup, qualified them for to the final round of qualification for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. Drawn with North Korea, Hong Kong, and Malaysia, Khalil helped Lebanon finish top of the group unbeaten, conceding only four goals in six games. Lebanon reached the Asian Cup finals for the first time through qualification. Khalil was included on the 2019 AFC Asian Cup squad as Lebanon's main goalkeeper. In the first two group stage matches, Lebanon lost 2‚Äì0 to both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Needing a win by four goals or more, Lebanon won 4‚Äì1 against North Korea for the first time in their history. However, the three points were not enough to qualify Lebanon for the knockout stage. Khalil played all 90 minutes in the three group stage games.  Style of play  Known as \\"the Mountain\\" () because of his height, Khalil is a goalkeeper with good reflexes and a large physical presence. At tall, Khalil was the fifth tallest goalkeeper at the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. He is a fine shot stopper, and has a tendency to punch balls away from crosses. In 2011 his agent Patrick M√∂rck described him as a \\"resilient, witty, and responsive goalkeeper\\", drawing similarities to Swedish former goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson. The same year Magnus Pehrsson, his coach at Djurg√•rden, reaffirmed the similarities with Pehrsson, noting \\"his size and his actions\\".  Personal life  Khalil's younger brother, Hadi, is also footballer; he plays as a goalkeeper for the Lebanese club Ahed. His uncle, Hussein Khalil, was also a footballer; he encouraged Mehdi to pursue football as more than a hobby. Khalil's favourite club is Manchester United, and his favourite player is former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Other than football, Khalil enjoys tennis and swimming.

Contribution in economy is equal to approx. 8.5%of total GDP. Textile Sector employs about 45% of the total Labor force in the country. In the year 2017-18 Exports of textile sector grew by $4.4 billion. Pakistan is also 3rd largest consumer of Cotton in the World. Total Textile mills are 464 in Pakistan out of which 5% are on the PSX .Textile has a total processing capacity of 5.2 billion square meters. International brands working in Pakistan with local textile mills are namely; H&M;, Levis, Nike, Adidas, Puma, Target etc. Textile businesses are concentrated in Karachi with a share of 38% and 18% in Faisalabad .Out of 464, 316 textile units in Punjab, 116 in Sindh. Major Players in this industry are Chenab Ltd, Al-Karam Textile Pvt Ltd, Fateh Textile Mills, Gul Ahmad Textile Mills Ltd, Hussein Industries Ltd, Kohinoor Textile Mills Ltd, Nishat Linen Group. Pakistan‚Äôs exports are under threat mainly from regional competitors because the governments of these countries support their textile industry a lot as compared to Pakistan‚Äôs government. Rs.185 million has been approved in Pakistan for the Export Development Fund for the development of the textile sectorThe textile industry provides 40% of the bank credit in Pakistan. In the 1950s, textile manufacturing emerged as a central part of Pakistan's industrialization, shortly following independence from the British rule in the South Asia. In 1974, the Pakistan government established the Cotton Export Corporation of Pakistan (CEC). The CEC served as a barrier to private manufacturers from participating in international trade. However, in the late 1980s, the role of the CEC diminished and by 1988-89, private manufacturers were able to buy cotton from ginners and sell in both domestic and foreign markets. Between 1947 and 2000, the number of textile mills in Pakistan increased from 3 to 600. In the same time period, spindles increased from 177,000 to 805 million.  Production  There are six primary sectors of the textile production in Pakistan: * Spinning * Weaving * Processing * Printing * Garment manufacturing * Filament yarn manufacturing Cotton is the largest segment of textile production. Other fibers produced include synthetic fiber, filament yarn, art silk, wool, and jute. * Cotton: Cotton spinning is perhaps the most important segment in the Pakistan textile industry with 521 units installed and operational. * Synthetic fibers: Within synthetic fibers, nylon, polyester, acrylic, and polyolefin dominate the market. There are currently five major producers of synthetic fibers in Pakistan, with a total capacity of 636,000 tons per annum. * Filament yarn: Three types of filament yarn are produced in Pakistan. These are acetate rayon yarn, polyester filament yarn, and nylon filament yarn. There are currently about 6 units in the country. * Artificial Silk: This fiber resembles silk but costs less to produce. There are about 90,000 looms in the country located mainly in Karachi, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Jalapur Jattan, as well as some in FATA. * Wool: The main products manufactured from wool include woolen yarn, acrylic yarn, fabrics, shawls, blankets, and carpets. * Jute: Jute sakes and hessian cloth are primarily used for packing agricultural products such as grain and rice. The production of jute products was approximately 100,000 tons in 2009-10.  Textile Production Technology & Skill Development  The Textile Institute Manchester, UK's local section for Lahore, Pakistan has played an extensive role in contributing to development of skill improvement and technology sharing through its various training and latest knowledge sharing platforms.https://www.textileinstitute.org/section/lahore/https://ptj.com.pk/Web-2016/11-2016/PDF- November-2016/Seminar-Textile-Asia-2016.pdf  Trade  Textiles comprise 57% of Pakistan's export revenues. However, in recent years, textile exports have declined significantly. Textile exports were recorded at $11.625 billion in 2014-2015. In 2015-2016, this number had dropped 7.7% to $10.395 billion. The Pakistan Textile Exporters Association recently requested the government to take significant measures to ensure the growth of textile exports and sustain the employment provided by the sector. Specifically, the PTEA has requested: * Zero rating on export value chain (i.e. no tax, no refund) to boost export growth * Subsidize a decrease in cost of production to boost competitiveness of Pakistani exports * Guarantee energy supply to textile mills at competitive rates Furthermore, the Pakistan Textile Mills Association has demanded that the removal of duty on cotton imports and a rebate of five percent on textile exports. This plea has come at a time with about 110 mills have been shut down due to various barriers to growth including the energy crisis.  Barriers to growth  In recent years, Pakistan has faced competition from regional players including Bangladesh, India and Vietnam. In the past decade, Pakistan's share in global textile market decreased to 1.7 percent from 2.2 percent, Bangladesh saw an increase from 1.9 to 3.3 percent and India from 3.4 to 4.7 percent. Barriers to growth include: * Cost of production: The rising cost of production in the country has stalled investment as well as export competitiveness. A vertical shift in monetary policy and KIBOR rates have contributed to an increase in the cost of doing business and reduced lending abilities of local manufacturers. * Energy Crisis: Pakistan is currently facing a large-scale energy crisis. Due to energy demand exceeding supply by about 5000 MW. The government manages the deficit through daily power cuts (or blackouts). These power cuts have significantly impacted manufacturing industries in Pakistan. Several textile mills have closed their units due to inability to sustain operations. In addition, the mills have reportedly turned away export orders due to the inability to fill these orders when power cuts per day can last upwards of 12 hours. * Research and Development: There has been a limited effort to improve the quality and quantity of textiles in Pakistan through research and development, limiting the competitiveness of Pakistan's textiles in the global market.  Labor rights  The textile industry is the second largest employment sector in Pakistan. Labor costs are estimated to be about five to eight percent of total cost while import income of the sector is estimated to be about $12.5 billion in 2010-11. Textile mill owners have often complained that labor costs are \\"too high\\" while workers continue to be underpaid and over utilized. Factories often do not issue letters of employments to workers and therefore can easily fire them without legal consequences. Furthermore, safety and security remains a significant issue at textile, where there are limited checks on exhaust systems, light systems, and waste water disposal. This dire state of affairs of labor rights comes in sharp contrast to the growing Pakistan fashion industry, which primary serves the country's elites.

His main contribution has been to the understanding of the mind and social relationships.  Early life and education  Burgess was born in Dumas, Texas to Wes and Dorothea Burgess. His family moved to St. Louis Missouri where he graduated from Ladue Horton Watkins High School and took classes at the Academy of Science, St. Louis, Washington University, and the St. Louis Zoo. Burgess earned his bachelor's degree and a literary award at Purdue University;Lafayette Indiana Journal and Courier, April 15, 1974, pp 19-20 he received a Ph.D. in Zoology at North Carolina State University, and an M.D. from the University of Miami School of Medicine. Burgess completed medical internship, psychiatry residency, and chief residency at Stanford University Medical Center, winning the Northern California Psychiatric Society Research Award.Burgess, J.

Burgess now devotes his time to writing and private consultation in Half Moon Bay, California, where he teaches at the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve.Between the Tides, June, p 4, 2017<  Scientific contributions  Burgess was the first United States scientist to discover social spiders,Burgess, J. Wesley. Social Spiders. Scientific American, vol 234, pp 99‚Äì106, 1976. which he described in Scientific American and other journals.Burgess, J. Wesley. Social spiders. In Howard Topoff, editor, Animal Societies and Evolution. Freeman Press, San Francisco, 1981.Burgess, J. Wesley. Social behavior in group-living spider species. In Peter Merrett, editor, Arachnology. Symposia, Zoological Society of London, Number. 42. Academic Press, London, 1978. Social spiders challenge theories of social biology because spiders are usually cannibalistic and would not be expected to form social groups. Burgess showed how social spiders modify their environment to be able to live together.Witt, Peter N. and Burgess, J. Wesley. Spider webs: Design and engineering. Naturwissenschafteliche Rundschau, vol 31, pp 269‚Äì282, 1978.Burgess, J. Wesley and Witt, Peter. Spider webs: Design and engineering. Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, vol 1, pp 322‚Äì335, 1976. For example, Mexican spiders called Mallos gregalis spin a web that amplifies the sounds of the flies that they eat and dampens the vibrations made by other spiders, allowing Mallos spiders to live in colonies containing hundreds of thousands of individuals.Burgess, J. Wesley. Web-signal processing for tolerance and group predation in the social spider Mallos gregalis. Animal Behavior, vol 27, pp 157‚Äì164, 1979. Another spider called Metepeira spinipes, spins two-part spider webs: individual orbs to catch prey, and vibration-damping tangled webs where spiders coexist peacefully.Burgess, J. Wesley, and Uetz, George. Social spacing strategies in spiders. In Peter N. Witt and Jerome Rovner, Editors, Spider Communication: Mechanisms and Ecological Significance. Princeton University Press, pp 317‚Äì352, 1982.Uetz, George and Burgess, J. Wesley. Habitat structure and colonial behavior in Metepeira spinipes. Psyche, vol 86, pp 79‚Äì89, 1979. Burgess also described Oecobius civitas spiders who exchange individual webs with each other as part of a unique prober/retaliator social strategy (see evolutionary game theory).Dawkins, Richard. The Selfish Gene, Oxford University Press, 2006.Burgess, J. Wesley. Social Spiders. Scientific American, vol 234, pp 99‚Äì106, 1976. Burgess compared the biological forces that produce social groups in shoaling and schooling fish, flocking and territorial birds, monkey colonies, and human social groups; developing techniques of pattern recognition for measuring and displaying proxemic distances between k-nearest neighbor individuals in a social group.Burgess, J. Wesley. Measurement of spacing behavior. Behavioral and Neural Biology, vol 26, pp 132‚Äì160, 1979. Burgess found similar subgrouping patterns in rhesus monkey colonies in Puerto Rico, while working at the North Carolina Department of Mental Health Research.Burgess, J. Wesley. Group spacing in rhesus monkey troops: Environmental factors. Behavioral and Neural Biology, vol 30, pp 49‚Äì55, 1980. These patterns change if only a few members receive psychoactive drugs.Burgess, J. Wesley, Witt, Peter N., Phoebus, E., and Weisbard, Charles. The spacing of rhesus monkey troops changes when a few members receive THC or amphetamine. Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior, vol 13, pp 121‚Äì124, 1980. Burgess‚Äô studies revealed how the dendrites of brain neurons grow during development.Burgess, J. Wesley, Monachello, Mark, and McGinn, Mike.

Wesley, and Coss, Richard. Plasticity of dendritic spine formation: A state-dependent developmental process. International Journal of Neuroscience, vol 12, pp 93‚Äì98, 1981. Together with Richard Coss at the University of California, Davis, Burgess was the first to show that sensory stimuli, including social stressors, can cause long-lasting changes in brain cell anatomical structure in just a few minutes.Burgess, J. Wesley, and Coss, Richard. Rapid effects of biologically relevant stimulation on tectal neurons: Changes in dendritic spine morphology after 9 minutes are retained for 24 hours. Brain Research, vol 266, pp 217‚Äì233, 1983. Together with Jaime Villablanca at UCLA, Burgess discovered that early brain injury resembling childhood congenital disorders and adult traumatic brain injury can heal naturally and that rehabilitative exercise improves brain healing.Burgess, J.

It may be drunk fresh or may be used to make areesh cheese, which in turn is used to make mish. There is evidence that it was made by the ancient Egyptians. Preparation The traditional way to make laban rayeb starts with milking cows directly into partially sterilized shallow or deep earthenware pots. The inside of a newly made pot (matared) is soaked in oil or a mixture of egg white and oil and then baked in a kiln to close the pores. After each use the matared is washed and dried in a hot oven for two hours. The milk is left for one to four days, depending on the temperature, while the fat rises to the top and the milk below curdles. The milk is kept at 20-25 ¬∞C (68-77 ¬∞F) while the curd forms. The milk is not disturbed while its natural microflora ferment it. The fat is scooped out and used to make butter. The remaining curd is the laban rayab. It smells similar to buttermilk, and has a slightly acid taste. Variants and derived products Laban khad is a variant that is fermented in a goat pelt. Goubasha is a traditional drink in the Sudan. Some cream is added to laban rayeb made from buffalo milk, and the mixture is then diluted with water. Laban zeer is another variant made in earthenware pots. It may be mixed with boiled, dried and ground wheat grains, fermented for twenty four hours, then sundried to make Kishk. This is a very nutritious food that may keep for several years. Karish cheese is made from laban rayeb by pouring the curd onto a reed mat and letting it drain, occasionally spreading it and squeezing it in the mat, and then hanging it for two or three days.

The culture of indigenous North America is usually defined by the concept of the Pre-Columbian culture area, namely a geographical region where shared cultural traits occur. The northwest culture area, for example shared common traits such as salmon fishing, woodworking, large villages or towns and a hierarchical social structure. Though cultural features, language, clothing, and customs vary enormously from one tribe to another, there are certain elements which are encountered frequently and shared by many tribes. Early European American scholars described the Native Americans as having a society dominated by clans. European colonization of the Americas had a major impact on Native American culture through what is known as the Columbian exchange. The Columbian exchange, also known as the Columbian interchange, was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World in the 15th and 16th centuries, following Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage. The Columbian exchange generally had a destructive impact on Native American culture through disease, and a 'clash of cultures',Emmer, Pieter. \\"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500‚Äì1800.\\" European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45‚Äì46 whereby European values of private property, the family, and labor led to conflict, appropriation of traditional communal lands and slavery.Emmer, Pieter. \\"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500‚Äì1800.\\" European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46 In the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages. Today, while remaining faithful to their traditions, Native American cultures continue to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances. Cultural areas Native Americans in the United States fall into a number of distinct ethno- linguistic and territorial phyla, whose only uniting characteristic is that they were in a stage of either Mesolithic (hunter-gatherer) or Neolithic (subsistence farming) culture at the time of European contact. They can be classified as belonging to a number of large cultural areas: *Continental U.S. **Californian tribes (Northern): Yok-Utian, Pacific Coast Athabaskan, Coast Miwok, Yurok, Palaihnihan, Chumashan, Uto-Aztecan **Plateau tribes: Interior Salish, Plateau Penutian **Great Basin tribes: Uto-Aztecan **Pacific Northwest Coast: Pacific Coast Athabaskan, Coast Salish **Southwestern tribes: Uto- Aztecan, Yuman, Southern Athabaskan **Plains Indians: Siouan, Plains Algonquian, Southern Athabaskan **Northeastern Woodlands tribes: Pequot, Mohican, Mohawk, Iroquoian, Central Algonquian, Eastern Algonquian **Southeastern Woodlands tribes: Muskogean, Siouan, Catawban, Iroquoian *Alaska Natives **Arctic: Eskimo‚ÄìAleut **Subarctic: Northern Athabaskan *Hawaiians Language Early indigenous languages in the U.S. There are approximately 296 spoken (or formerly spoken) indigenous languages north of Mexico, 269 of which are grouped into 29 families. The major ethno-linguistic phyla are: *Na-Dene languages, *Iroquoian languages, *Caddoan languages *Algonquian languages *Algic languages, *Siouan‚ÄìCatawban languages, *Uto- Aztecan languages, *Salishan languages, *Tanoan languages *Eskimo‚ÄìAleut (Alaska) The Na-Den√©, Algic, and Uto-Aztecan families are the largest in terms of number of languages. Uto-Aztecan has the most speakers (1.95 million) if the languages in Mexico are considered (mostly due to 1.5 million speakers of Nahuatl); Na-Den√© comes in second with approximately 200,000 speakers (nearly 180,000 of these are speakers of Navajo), and Algic in third with about 180,000 speakers (mainly Cree and Ojibwe). Na-Den√© and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the Kickapoo) with two outliers in California (Yurok and Wiyot). The remaining 27 languages are either isolates or unclassified), such as Penutian languages, Hokan, Gulf languages and others. Organization Zuni girl with pottery jar on her head in 1909 Gens structure Early European American scholar described the Native Americans (as well as any other tribal society) as having a society dominated by clans or gentes (in the Roman model) before tribes were formed. There were some common characteristics: *The right to elect its sacheem and chiefs. *The right to depose its sachem and chiefs. *The obligation not to marry in the gens. *Mutual rights of inheritance of the property of deceased members. *Reciprocal obligations of help, defense, and redress of injuries. *The right to bestow names on its members. *The right to adopt strangers into the gens. *Common religious rights, query. *A common burial place. *A council of the gens. Tribal structure Subdivision and differentiation took place between various groups. Some functions and attributes of tribes are: *The possession of the gentes. *The right to depose these sachems and chiefs. *The possession of a religious faith and worship. *A supreme government consisting of a council of chiefs. *A head-chief of the tribe in some instances. Traditional diet  Maize grown by Native Americans Chippewa baby waits on a cradleboard while parents tend rice crops (Minnesota, 1940). The traditional diet of Native Americans derived from a mixture of agriculture, hunting, and the gathering of wild foods. By 800 CE the Native Americans had established three main crops ‚Äî beans, squash, and maize (or corn);‚Äî called the three sisters. Other early crops included cotton, sunflower, pumpkins, tobacco, goosefoot, knotgrass, and sump weed. Agriculture in the southwest started around 4,000 years ago when traders brought cultigens from Mexico. Due to the varying climate, some ingenuity was needed for agriculture to be successful. The climate in the southwest ranged from cool, moist mountains regions, to dry, sandy soil in the desert. Some innovations of the time included irrigation to bring water into the dry regions and the selection of seed based on the traits of the growing plants that bore them. In the southwest, they grew beans that were self- supported, much like the way they are grown today. In the east, however, they were planted right by corn in order for the vines to be able to \\"climb\\" the cornstalks. The most important crop the Native Americans raised was maize. It was first started in Mesoamerica and spread north. About 2,000 years ago it reached eastern America. This crop was important to the Native Americans because it was part of their everyday diet; it could be stored in underground pits during the winter, and no part of it was wasted. The husk was made into art crafts, and the cob was used as fuel for fires. The agriculture gender roles of the Native Americans varied from region to region. In the southwest area, men prepared the soil with hoes. The women were in charge of planting, weeding, and harvesting the crops. In most other regions, the women were in charge of doing everything, including clearing the land. Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields frequently. There is a tradition that Squanto showed the Pilgrims in New England how to put fish in fields to act like a fertilizer, but the truth of this story is debated. Native Americans did plant beans next to corn; the beans would replace the nitrogen which the corn took from the ground, as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing. Native Americans used controlled fires to burn weeds and clear fields; this would put nutrients back into the ground. If this did not work, they would simply abandon the field to let it be fallow, and find a new spot for cultivation. Europeans in the eastern part of the continent observed that Natives cleared large areas for cropland. Their fields in New England sometimes covered hundreds of acres. Colonists in Virginia noted thousands of acres under cultivation by Native Americans. Native Americans commonly used tools such as the hoe, maul, and dibber. The hoe was the main tool used to till the land and prepare it for planting; then it was used for weeding. The first versions were made out of wood and stone. When the settlers brought iron, Native Americans switched to iron hoes and hatchets. The dibber was a digging stick, used to plant the seed. Once the plants were harvested, women prepared the produce for eating. They used the maul to grind the corn into mash. It was cooked and eaten that way or baked as corn bread. I√±upiat, the Inuit of Alaska, prepared and buried large amounts of dried meat and fish. Pacific Northwest tribes crafted seafaring dugouts long for fishing. Farmers in the Eastern Woodlands tended fields of maize with hoes and digging sticks, while their neighbors in the Southeast grew tobacco as well as food crops. On the Plains, some tribes engaged in agriculture but also planned buffalo hunts in which herds were driven over bluffs. Dwellers of the Southwest deserts hunted small animals and gathered acorns to grind into flour with which they baked wafer-thin bread on top of heated stones. Some groups on the region's mesas developed irrigation techniques, and filled storehouses with grain as protection against the area's frequent droughts. Religion Kateri Tekakwitha, the patron of ecologists, exiles, and orphans, was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church. Baptism of Pocahontas was painted in 1840. John Gadsby Chapman depicts Pocahontas, wearing white, being baptized Rebecca by Anglican minister Alexander Whiteaker in Jamestown, Virginia; this event is believed to have taken place in 1613 or 1614. Traditional Native American ceremonies are still practiced by many tribes and bands, and the older theological belief systems are still held by many of the \\"traditional\\" people. These spiritualities may accompany adherence to another faith, or can represent a person's primary religious identity. While much Native American spiritualism exists in a tribal-cultural continuum, and as such cannot be easily separated from tribal identity itself, certain other more clearly defined movements have arisen among \\"traditional\\" Native American practitioners, these being identifiable as \\"religions\\" in the prototypical sense familiar in the industrialized Western world. Traditional practices of some tribes include the use of sacred herbs such as tobacco, sweetgrass or sage. Many Plains tribes have sweatlodge ceremonies, though the specifics of the ceremony vary among tribes. Fasting, singing and prayer in the ancient languages of their people, and sometimes drumming are also common. The Midewiwin Lodge is a traditional medicine society inspired by the oral traditions and prophesies of the Ojibwa (Chippewa) and related tribes. Another significant religious body among Native peoples is known as the Native American Church. It is a syncretistic church incorporating elements of Native spiritual practice from a number of different tribes as well as symbolic elements from Christianity. Its main rite is the peyote ceremony. Prior to 1890, traditional religious beliefs included Wakan Tanka. In the American Southwest, especially New Mexico, a syncretism between the Catholicism brought by Spanish missionaries and the native religion is common; the religious drums, chants, and dances of the Pueblo people are regularly part of Masses at Santa Fe's Saint Francis Cathedral.A Brief History of the Native American Church by Jay Fikes. Retrieved 2006-02-22. Native American-Catholic syncretism is also found elsewhere in the United States. (e.g., the National Kateri Tekakwitha Shrine in Fonda, New York and the National Shrine of the North American Martyrs in Auriesville, New York). The eagle feather law (Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations) stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The law does not allow Native Americans to give eagle feathers to non-Native Americans. Gender roles Dr. Susan La Flesche Picotte was the first Native American woman to become a physician in the United States. Gender roles were differentiated in most Native American tribes. Both sexes had power in decision making within the tribe. Many tribes, such as the Haudenosaunee Five Nations and the Southeast Muskogean tribes, had matrilineal systems, in which property and hereditary leadership were controlled by and passed through the maternal lines. The children were considered to belong to the mother's clan and achieved status within it. When the tribe adopted war captives, the children became part of their mother's clan and accepted in the tribe. In Cherokee and other matrilineal cultures, wives owned the family property. When young women married, their husbands joined them in their mother's household. This enabled the young women to have assistance for childbirth and rearing; it also protected her in case of conflicts between the couple. If they separated or the man was killed at war, the woman had her family to assist her. In addition, in matrilineal culture, the mother's brother was the leading male figure in a male child's life, as he mentored the child within the mother's clan. The husband had no standing in his wife's and children's clan, as he belonged to his own mother's clan. Hereditary clan chief positions passed through the mother's line. Chiefs were selected on recommendation of women elders, who also could disapprove of a chief. There were sometimes hereditary roles for men called peace chiefs, but war chiefs were selected based on proven prowess in battle. Men usually had the roles of hunting, waging war, and negotiating with other tribes, including the Europeans after their arrival. Others were patriarchal, although several different systems were in use. In the patrilineal tribes, such as the Omaha, Osage and Ponca, hereditary leadership passed through the male line, and children were considered to belong to the father and his clan. For this reason, when Europeans or American men took wives from such tribes, their children were considered \\"white\\" like their fathers, or \\"half-breeds\\". Generally such children could have no official place in the tribe because their fathers did not belong to it, unless they were adopted by a male and made part of his family.

The women had primary responsibility for the survival and welfare of the families (and future of the tribe); they gathered and cultivated plants, used plants and herbs to treat illnesses, cared for the young and the elderly, made all the clothing and instruments, and processed and cured meat and skins from the game. They tanned hides to make clothing as well as bags, saddle cloths, and tepee covers. Mothers used cradleboards to carry an infant while working or traveling.Beatrice Medicine, \\"Gender\\", Encyclopedia of North American Indians, February 9, 2006. At least several dozen tribes allowed polygyny to sisters, with procedural and economic limits. Apart from making homes, women had many additional tasks that were also essential for the survival of the tribes. They made weapons and tools, took care of the roofs of their homes and often helped their men hunt bison.\\"Native American Women\\", Indians.org. Retrieved 2007-01-11.

Sports Jim Thorpe was called the \\"greatest athlete in the world\\" by king Gustaf V of Sweden Native American leisure time led to competitive individual and team sports. Jim Thorpe, Joe Hipp, Notah Begay III, Jacoby Ellsbury, and Billy Mills are well known professional athletes. Ball players from the Choctaw and Lakota tribe as painted by George Catlin in the 1830s Team based Native American ball sports, sometimes referred to as lacrosse, stickball, or baggataway, was often used to settle disputes, rather than going to war, as a civil way to settle potential conflict. The Choctaw called it isitoboli (\\"Little Brother of War\\"); the Onondaga name was dehuntshigwa'es (\\"men hit a rounded object\\"). There are three basic versions, classified as Great Lakes, Iroquoian, and Southern. The game is played with one or two rackets/sticks and one ball. The object of the game is to land the ball on the opposing team's goal (either a single post or net) to score and to prevent the opposing team from scoring on your goal. The game involves as few as 20 or as many as 300 players with no height or weight restrictions and no protective gear. The goals could be from around apart to about ; in Lacrosse the field is . Individual Chunkey was a game that consisted of a disk shaped stone that was about 1‚Äì2 inches in diameter. The disk was thrown down a corridor so that it could roll past the players at great speed. The disk would roll down the corridor, and players would throw wooden shafts at the moving disk. The object of the game was to strike the disk or prevent your opponents from hitting it. Music Jake Fragua, Jemez Pueblo from New Mexico Traditional Native American music is almost entirely monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Native American music often includes drumming and/or the playing of rattles or other percussion instruments but little other instrumentation. Flutes and whistles made of wood, cane, or bone are also played, generally by individuals, but in former times also by large ensembles (as noted by Spanish conquistador de Soto). The tuning of modern flutes is typically pentatonic. Performers with Native American parentage have occasionally appeared in American popular music, such as Robbie Robertson (The Band), Rita Coolidge, Wayne Newton, Gene Clark, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Blackfoot, Tori Amos, Redbone, and CocoRosie. Some, such as John Trudell, have used music to comment on life in Native America, and others, such as R. Carlos Nakai integrate traditional sounds with modern sounds in instrumental recordings, whereas the music by artist Charles Littleleaf is derived from ancestral heritage and nature. A variety of small and medium- sized recording companies offer an abundance of recent music by Native American performers young and old, ranging from pow-wow drum music to hard- driving rock-and-roll and rap. The most widely practiced public musical form among Native Americans in the United States is that of the pow-wow. At pow- wows, such as the annual Gathering of Nations in Albuquerque, New Mexico, members of drum groups sit in a circle around a large drum. Drum groups play in unison while they sing in a native language and dancers in colorful regalia dance clockwise around the drum groups in the center. Familiar pow-wow songs include honor songs, intertribal songs, crow-hops, sneak-up songs, grass- dances, two-steps, welcome songs, going-home songs, and war songs. Most indigenous communities in the United States also maintain traditional songs and ceremonies, some of which are shared and practiced exclusively within the community. Art Drawings of kachina dolls, from an 1894 anthropology book. Pueblo peoples crafted impressive items associated with their religious ceremonies. Kachina dancers wore elaborately painted and decorated masks as they ritually impersonated various ancestral spirits. Sculpture was not highly developed, but carved stone and wood fetishes were made for religious use. Superior weaving, embroidered decorations, and rich dyes characterized the textile arts. Both turquoise and shell jewelry were created, as were high- quality pottery and formalized pictorial arts. Navajo spirituality focused on the maintenance of a harmonious relationship with the spirit world, often achieved by ceremonial acts, usually incorporating sandpainting. The colors‚Äîmade from sand, charcoal, cornmeal, and pollen‚Äîdepicted specific spirits. These vivid, intricate, and colorful sand creations were erased at the end of the ceremony. The Eastern Woodland Indians used the hoe. Native American art comprises a major category in the world art collection. Native American contributions include pottery, paintings, jewelry, weavings, sculpture, basketry, and carvings. Franklin Grits was a Cherokee artist who taught students from many tribes at Haskell Institute (now Haskell Indian Nations University) in the 1940s, the Golden Age of Native American painters. The integrity of certain Native American artworks is protected by an act of Congress that prohibits representation of art as Native American when it is not the product of an enrolled Native American artist. Writing and communication Sequoyah, inventor of the Cherokee syllabary Native Americans in the United States have developed several original systems of communication, both in Pre-Columbian times, and later as a response to European influences. For example, the Iroquois, living around the Great Lakes and extending east and north, used strings or belts called wampum that served a dual function: the knots and beaded designs mnemonically chronicled tribal stories and legends, and further served as a medium of exchange and a unit of measure. The keepers of the articles were seen as tribal dignitaries.Iroquois History. Retrieved 2006-02-23. Another form of communication was the Wiigwaasabak, birch bark scrolls on which the Ojibwa (Anishinaabe) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing. A widely used form of communication was Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL), also known as Plains Sign Talk, Plains Sign Language and First Nation Sign Language. PISL is a trade language (or international auxiliary language), formerly a trade pidgin, that was once the lingua franca across central Canada, central and western United States and northern Mexico, used among the various Plains Nations. It was also used for story-telling, oratory, various ceremonies, and by deaf people for ordinary daily use. In the late 1810s and early 1820s, the Cherokee syllabary was invented by the silversmith Sequoyah to write the Cherokee language. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy as he could not previously read any script. He first experimented with logograms, before developing his system into a syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme; the 85 (originally 86) characters provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Although some symbols resemble Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic letters, the relationship between symbols and sounds is different. The success of the Cherokee syllabary inspired James Evans, a missionary in what is now Manitoba, during the 1840s to develop Cree syllabics. Evans had originally adapted the Latin script to Ojibwe (see Evans system), but after learning of the Cherokee syllabary, he experimented with invented scripts based on his familiarity with shorthand and Devanagari.[ When Evans later worked with the closely related Cree, and ran into trouble with the Latin alphabet, he turned to his Ojibwe project and in 1840 adapted it to the Cree language. The result contained just nine glyph shapes, each of which stood for a syllable with the vowels determined by the orientations of these shapes. Cree syllabics are primarily a Canadian phenomenon, but are used occasionally in the United States by communities that straddle the border. Interracial relations Interracial relations between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans is a complex issue that has been mostly neglected with \\"few in-depth studies on interracial relationships\\". Some of the first documented cases of European/Native American intermarriage and contact were recorded in Post-Columbian Mexico. One case is that of Gonzalo Guerrero, a European from Spain, who was shipwrecked along the Yucatan Peninsula, and fathered three Mestizo children with a Mayan noblewoman. Another is the case of Hern√°n Cort√©s and his mistress La Malinche, who gave birth to another of the first multi-racial people in the Americas. Assimilation European impact was immediate, widespread, and profound‚Äîmore than any other race that had contact with Native Americans during the early years of colonization and nationhood. Europeans living among Native Americans were often called \\"White Indians\\". They \\"lived in native communities for years, learned native languages fluently, attended native councils, and often fought alongside their native companions.\\" Early contact was often charged with tension and emotion, but also had moments of friendship, cooperation, and intimacy. Marriages took place in English, Spanish, and French colonies between Native Americans and Europeans. Given the preponderance of men among the colonists in the early years, generally European men married American Indian women. Charles Eastman was one of the first Native Americans to become certified as a medical doctor, after he graduated from Boston University. There was fear on both sides, as the different peoples realized how different their societies were. The whites regarded the Indians as \\"savage\\" because they were not Christian. They were suspicious of cultures which they did not understand. The Native American author, Andrew J. Blackbird, wrote in his History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan, (1897), that white settlers introduced some immoralities into Native American tribes. Many Indians suffered because the Europeans introduced alcohol and the whiskey trade resulted in alcoholism among the people, who were alcohol-intolerant. As European-American women started working independently at missions and Indian schools in the western states, there were more opportunities for their meeting and developing relationships with Native American men. For instance, Charles Eastman, a man of European and Lakota descent whose father sent both his sons to Dartmouth College, got his medical degree at Boston University and returned to the West to practice. He married Elaine Goodale, whom he met in South Dakota. He was the grandson of Seth Eastman, a military officer from Maine, and a chief's daughter. Goodale was a young European-American teacher from Massachusetts and a reformer, who was appointed as the US superintendent of Native American education for the reservations in the Dakota Territory. They had six children together. Slavery The majority of Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America, but none exploited slave labor on a large scale. In addition, Native Americans did not buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members. The conditions of enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes. In many cases, young enslaved captives were adopted into the tribes to replace warriors killed during warfare or by disease. Other tribes practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes; but, this status was only temporary as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society. Among some Pacific Northwest tribes, about a quarter of the population were slaves.\\"Slavery in Historical Perspective \\". Digital History, University of Houston. Other slave-owning tribes of North America were, for example, Comanche of Texas, Creek of Georgia, the Pawnee, and Klamath.\\"Slave-owning societies\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's Guide to Black History. There was heavily incentive by Europeans as a way of driving deeper wedges between Africans and Europeans as the Seminole Confederation had proved formidable. Slave holding societies, like the Choctaw, were given highest privilege and respect amongst the Europeans and trade preference. =European enslavement= When Europeans arrived as colonists in North America, Native Americans changed their practice of slavery dramatically. Native Americans began selling war captives to whites rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the West Indies grew with the cultivation of sugar cane, Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the Thirteen Colonies, and some were exported to the \\"sugar islands.\\" The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo. Accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist. Scholars estimate tens of thousands of Native Americans may have been enslaved by the Europeans, sometimes being sold by Native Americans themselves but often war prizes with Europeans, similar to the Pequot's extinction. Slavery became a caste of people who were foreign to the English (Native Americans, Africans and their descendants) and non-Christians. The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705: The slave trade of Native Americans lasted only until around 1730. It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the Yamasee War. The Indian Wars of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the Choctaw, the Creek, and the Catawba for protection. Native American women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved or not; during the early colonial years, settlers were disproportionately male. They turned to Native women for sexual relationships. Both Native American and African enslaved women suffered rape and sexual harassment by male slaveholders and other white men. Lillian Gross, described as a \\"Mixed Blood\\" by the Smithsonian source, was of Cherokee and European-American heritage. Raised within Cherokee culture, she identified with that. Relation with Africans in the United States African and Native Americans have interacted for centuries. The earliest record of Native American and African contact occurred in April 1502, when Spanish colonists transported the first Africans to Hispaniola to serve as slaves.Muslims in American History : A Forgotten Legacy by Dr. Jerald F. Dirks. p. 204. Buffalo Soldiers, 1890. The nickname was given to the \\"Black Cavalry\\" by the Native American tribes they fought. Native Americans were rewarded if they returned escaped slaves, and African Americans were rewarded for fighting in the late 19th-century Indian Wars. While numerous tribes used captive enemies as servants and slaves, they also often adopted younger captives into their tribes to replace members who had died. In the Southeast, a few Native American tribes began to adopt a slavery system similar to that of the American colonists, buying African American slaves, especially the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek. Though less than 3% of Native Americans owned slaves, divisions grew among the Native Americans over slavery. Among the Cherokee, records show that slave holders in the tribe were largely the children of European men that had shown their children the economics of slavery. As European colonists took slaves into frontier areas, there were more opportunities for relationships between African and Native American peoples. Among the Five Civilized Tribes, mixed-race slaveholders were generally part of an elite hierarchy, often based on their mothers' clan status, as the societies had matrilineal systems. As did Benjamin Hawkins, European fur traders and colonial officials tended to marry high-status women, in strategic alliances seen to benefit both sides. The Choctaw, Creek and Cherokee believed they benefited from stronger alliances with the traders and their societies. The women's sons gained their status from their mother's families; they were part of hereditary leadership lines who exercised power and accumulated personal wealth in their changing Native American societies. The chiefs of the tribes believed that some of the new generation of mixed-race, bilingual chiefs would lead their people into the future and be better able to adapt to new conditions influenced by European Americans. Philosophy Native American authors have written about aspects of \\"tribal philosophy\\" as opposed to the modern or Western worldview. Thus, Yankton Dakota author Vine Deloria Jr. in an essay \\"Philosophy and the Tribal Peoples\\" argued that whereas a \\"traditional Westerner\\" might reason, \\"Man is mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is mortal,\\" aboriginal thinking might read, 'Socrates is mortal, because I once met Socrates and he is a man like me, and I am mortal.'Romano, Carlin. America the Philosophical. New York: Random House Inc., 2012. 446. Print. Deloria explains that both of the statements assume that all men are mortal, and that these statements are not verifiable on these grounds. The line of Indian thinking, however uses empirical evidence through memory to verify that Socrates was in fact a man like the person originally making the statement, and enhances the validity of the thinking. Deloria made the distinction, \\"whereas the Western syllogism simply introduces a doctrine using general concepts and depends on faith in the chain of reasoning for its verification, the Indian statement would stand by itself without faith and belief.\\"Waters, Anne. American Indian Thought. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2004. 6. Print. Deloria also comments that Native American thinking is very specific (in the way described above) compared to the broadness of traditional Western thinking, which leads to different interpretations of basic principles. American thinkers have previously denounced Native ideas because of this narrower approach, as it leads to 'blurry' distinctions between the 'real' and the 'internal.'Waters, Anne. American Indian Thought. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2004. 6-8. Print. According to Carlin Romano, the best resource on a characteristically \\"Native American Philosophy\\" is Scott Pratt's, Native Pragmatism: Rethinking the Roots of American Philosophy, which relates the ideas of many 'American' philosophers like Pierce, James, and Dewey to important concepts in early Native thought.Romano, Carlin. America the Philosophical. New York: Random House Inc., 2012. 447. Print. Pratt's publication takes his readers on a journey through American philosophical history from the colonial time period, and via detailed analysis, connects the experimental nature of early American pragmatism to the empirical habit of indigenous Americans. Though Pratt makes these alliances very comprehensible, he also makes clear that the lines between the ideas of Native Americans and American philosophers are complex and historically difficult to trace.Pratt, Scott.

Family background Henry was the son of Frederic III, Count of Vianden (de) (c. 1160 - 1210), and Mechthild (Mathilde) of Neuerburg (?), (b.c. 1130/1170 - c. 1200). At least his father married a Mechtild and another son, Frederick I, younger brother of Henry, inherited Neuerburg and married Cecilia of Isenburg, but that dynasty became extinct with the death of Frederick III of Neuerburg in 1332 (de). Life In 1216 Henry married Margaret, Marchioness of Namur, sometimes called \\"Sibilia\\" (c. 1194 - 17 July 1270), daughter of Peter II of Courtenay and Yolanda of Flanders. Margaret was the widow of Raoul, lord of Issoudun and thence Lady of Ch√¢teauneuf-sur-Cher and Mareuil-en-Berry. Margaret became Marchioness of Namur after the death of her brother Henry II, Marquis of Namur in 1229. Margaret and Henry ruled Namur (apparently as Henry III of Namur) until 1237 when they had to transfer Namur to Margaret's brother, emperor Baldwin II of Courtenay. Henry and Margaret continued ruling Vianden. Henry V, Count of Luxembourg (1216 ‚Äì 1281), maternal grandson of Henry IV, Count of Luxembourg (Henry I of Namur), invaded Namur and ruled it 1256-1264 as Henry IV (or III). Baldwin sold Namur in c. 1263 to his cousin Guy of Dampierre, count of Flanders and Henry IV was removed by military force but they made peace with family marriage. After Henry's death in 1252, Margaret entered a convent in Marienthal. Issue Henry and Margaret had the following children: * Matilda (c. 1216 - a. 1255), married around 1235 with John Angelos of Syrmia (c. 1193 - d. before 1253), Lord of Syrmia.

It is a multicultural cuisine as a result of the city consisting of various ethnic groups from different parts of Pakistan. Karachi is considered the melting pot of Pakistan.Miandad, Muhammad, et al. \\"Educational status and awareness among tuberculosis patients of Karachi.\\" J Pak Med Assoc 66.3 (2016): 265-9. The cuisine of Karachi is strongly influenced by the city's Muhajir population, who came from various parts of India and settled primarily in Karachi after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. Most Urdu speaking Muslims have traditionally been based in Karachi, hence the city is known for Muhajir tastes in its cuisine. North Indian Muslims maintained their old established culinary traditions, including variety of dishes and beverages. The Mughal, Awadhi, and Hyderabadi cuisine played an influential role in the making of their cuisine, having taste vary from mild to spicy and is often associated with aroma. In comparison to other Pakistani dishes, Muhajir cuisine tends to use stronger spices and flavors. Most of a dastarkhawan dining table include chapatti, rice, dal, vegetable and meat curry. Special dishes include biryani, Pulao, qorma, Paya, kofta, seekh kabab, Nihari, Haleem, Nargisi Koftay, Kata-Kat, Rogani Naan, Naan, sheer- qurma (sweet), chai (sweet, milky tea), and paan. North Indian cuisine is renowned for its cultural fusion, due to various empires and peoples occupying this region. As a result, Bengali cuisine, Gujarati cuisine, Bihari cuisine, Uttar Pradeshi cuisine and Muslim Hyderabadi cuisine collaboratively had an influence on the style of Muhajir food. The Pakistani cuisines such as Sindhi cuisine, Punjabi cuisine, Pashtun cuisine, Kalash cuisine, Saraiki cuisine, Kashmiri cuisine, Balochi cuisine, and other regional cuisines have also influenced the cuisine of Karachi.

He was most notable for painting his 72 portraits of the survivors of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. In addition to his portraiture, he was also featured as a technical advisor on Native American culture for the films Cheyenne Autumn, How the West was Won, and the TV show Daniel Boone. Miller also wrote several books on Indian history. In 1948, he arranged the last meeting of the Bighorn survivors at the dedication of the Crazy Horse Memorial.  Biography  Miller was born in Van Wert, Ohio, into a family of artists. He spent most of his childhood sketching and painting to develop his artistic talent. At age 16 with the aid of a translator, he first visited the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and began interviewing the remaining survivors of the Battle of Little Bighorn, most of whom were over 70 years old. Most of them had never before conveyed their stories to a white man. As the Indian warriors were a majority of the battle survivors, these assorted interviews proved very important to later historical study of Custer's fall. He went on to study art at the University of Michigan, New York University, and at the Grand Central School of Art under Harvey Dunn. He also worked privately with Winold Reiss, continuing his work on the Bighorn survivors with his family's blessing during the summer. In 1942, he went into service for the 14th Air Corps in China during World War II. By the time of his return to the United States, there were only 20 living survivors of the battle. Furthering his study of the Plains peoples, Miller learned 14 Indian languages, including sign languages, and was adopted into 16 separate Indian families. Eventually, he was given the name Chief Iron White Man by Black Elk, in honor of the Oglala Sioux medicine man who had been at Little Bighorn. He later served as a technical advisor for 25 \\"Western\\" films. A good friend of Korczak Ziolkowski, Miller organized the last reunion of the remaining 8 Bighorn survivors on June 3, 1948, at the dedication of the Crazy Horse Memorial. In 1971, he wrote an extensive article on the recollections of the Custer survivors for American Heritage magazine. In his later years, Miller and his wife, Jan, lived in Rancho Santa Fe, California, where he continued to paint and write until his death in 1992.  Works  Miller's most prominent and historically significant works were his 72 portraits of Custer survivors, which began with his painting of Chief Henry Oscar One Bull in 1935, and were completed in 1942.

He was the son of Craterus who had faithfully governed Corinth and Chalcis for his half-brother Antigonus II Gonatas. His grandmother was Phila, the celebrated daughter of Antipater and first wife of Demetrius Poliorcetes. According to a note in Livy (XXXV, 26), his mother's name may have been Nicaea and this was also the name of his wife. At his father's death around 263 Alexander inherited his position, which went then far beyond that of a mere Macedonian garrison commander and resembled more a dynastic regency in Greece. For some years Alexander remained loyal to Antigonus, but by 253 he accepted subsidies from the Egyptian king Ptolemy II Philadelphus and resolved to challenge the Macedonian supremacy seeking independence as a tyrant. The loss of Corinth and Euboea was an almost irreparable blow to the Macedonian hegemony over Greece. Antigonus tried to recover, building an alliance with Athens, Argos and Sicyon, but Alexander managed to pull Sicyon over to his side and subsequently allied himself with the Achaean League. Challenged by a contemporary offensive of his Ptolemaic rival in the Cyclades, Antigonus was unable to protect his allies. In 249 Alexander carried victories over Athens and Argos and the following year he possibly forced his enemies to accept a truce. At the height of his power, Alexander died in 247 under circumstances which led his contemporaries to believe that he had been poisoned by Antigonus Gonatas. Alexander's widow Nicaea assumed control of his possessions, but after the death of her protector Ptolemy Philadelphus in 246 her position was weakened. When Antigonus carried a naval victory over his enemies and an Aetolian raid into Boeotia threatened Chalcis, Attica and Corinth, she accepted to marry Antigonus' son and heir Demetrius II Aetolicus. During the marriage celebrations in the winter of 245/44 Antigonus took in the garrison of the Acrocorinth and regained control of his former possessions. References * *Aratos of Sicyon by F. W.

For the current organization sharing the same name see American Veterans Committee. The American Veterans Committee was founded in 1943 as a liberal veterans organization and an alternative to groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which supported a conservative political and social agenda.Peace Campaign, Time, December 3, 1945 The organization's roots were planted in 1942 when Sgt. Gilbert Harrison began to correspond with fellow servicemen concerning an organization that expanded beyond the needs of military men. In 1943, the University Religious Conference at UCLA became a meeting place for the military men who shared this desire for a veterans organization that also advocated peace and justice. One year later in 1944, Charles Bolte joined the UCLA group and the American Veterans Committee was born. The founding group included Futurist Donald Prell. The new organization immediately began to publish the AVC Bulletin to document the organization's advocacy issues.Guide to the American Veterans Committee Records, 1942-2002, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University. With a motto of \\"Citizens First, Veterans Second,\\" the AVC supported a range of liberal causes. Most notably, the organization challenged segregationist policy and maintained racially integrated chapters in Southern states before the era of civil rights.Schmadeke, Steve, American Veterans Committee to close last chapter, based in Park Forest, Chicago Tribune, February 07, 2008 It also played an integral role in establishing the World Veterans Federation in 1950, which still advocates the building of peace among former adversaries. While other veterans' organizations lobbied for financial \\"bonuses\\" for returning veterans, the AVC opposed such bonuses, supporting instead housing and education programs for veterans.Robert Francis Saxe (2007), Settling down: World War II veterans' challenge to the postwar consensus, p. 152. Unlike other veterans' groups, the AVC offered full membership to women and people of color.Phillips, Julie. James Tiptree, Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2006. During its early years, AVC grew at exponential rates: 5,500 members in 1945, 18,000 members in 1946, and 100,000 members in 1947. However, there was a drastic drop in membership after the organization became embroiled in the Second Red Scare. While American Communists had initially disdained the AVC as \\"Ivy Leaguers\\", they later reversed their policy when their members were rejected from the American Legion, and encouraged their members to join the AVC.March & Countermarch, Time, January 27, 1947 In response to the Second Red Scare campaign, AVC ejected its Communist members and closed future membership to supporters of totalitarian parties. While the organization purged itself of Communists and survived the scandal, the episode resulted in a decrease in membership from 100,000 in 1947 to 20,000 in 1948. In its smaller form, the AVC continued through 2007 to promote efforts, in the words of historian John Egerton, to \\"right social wrongs at home\\" by supporting a variety of liberal causes: civil rights, civil liberties, veterans affairs, and international affairs. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., AVC was able to frequently testify before Congress, file briefs in major court cases, and provide legal aid to minority veterans in the South. In order to strengthen their force, the organization partnered with other organizations, such as the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, to advocate issues. AVC also created grass-roots efforts on numerous campuses in its early years. After the War, thousands of veterans flocked to universities to take advantage of their GI Bill education benefits, which laid a foundation for the AVC to create a strong on-campus presence. Throughout its existence, the organization advocated various aspects of its core mission of civil rights and liberties. In 1960s, AVC took on the role of watchdog in military and veterans affairs that continued throughout its existence. The organization drew attention to the Draft (1966), Human Rights of the Man in Uniform (1968 and 1970), Education Problems of Returning Vietnam Veterans (1972), and National Service (1989). During the 1970s, AVC created programs to assist Vietnam veterans with less-than-honorable discharges by providing legal advice and worked with the government to create programs for minority and female veterans, to expand representation available to veterans, and to establish a Court of Veterans Appeals. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, AVC also focused their attention on the underserved women veterans. Their efforts resulted in the creation of a Women Veterans Advisory Committee at the Veterans Administration and a new department focused on the needs of women veterans. In the 1990s there was a shift in focus to the veterans returning from the Gulf War, national service, and equality for gays in the military. The last two chapters closed in 2007 and 2008.

His masterpiece was Il Sultano (1851). Biography He began his studies in Palermo with Pietro Raimondi. Afterward Antonino moved to Naples to study with Saverio Mercadante. Back in Catania, after this training period, he composed sacred and chamber music.Danzuso (1987) He composed the oratory La disfatta degli Assiri (The Assyrian Defeat)(1850) and Gerusalemme Liberata (Jerusalem Delivered) (1852), both performed in Catania during the August Saint Agatha festivities. In 1851, at the Teatro Comunale di Catania was performed for the first time Il Sultano or Maometto II (The Sultan or Muhammad II). The same opera was performed in Naples at the Teatro di San Carlo in 1854 with enthusiastic success, thanks also to the outstanding cast of singers, which included among others the tenor Emilio Pancani and soprano Carlotta Carrozzi Zucchi. In 1859 the opera Caterina di Guisa (Catherine of Guise) was performed for the first time at Teatro Comunale di Catania.Morina (2008) In 1859, he was appointed director of the Teatro Comunale di Catania. Antonino had to leave soon Sicily, taking refuge in Malta, to escape the Bourbon police because of his activities as a patriot and opponent of Bourbon's regime. In Malta he remained until Garibaldi's arrival in Sicily (1860), then Antonino returned to his hometown. He devoted himself again to composition and teaching.

Retrieved 10 September 2012. The Leatherback Trust was founded in 2000 to help consolidate Las Baulas National Marine Park, one of the last major nesting site for the critically endangered leatherback turtle in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.http://www.seaturtlestatus.org/report/view. Volume 1. The park protects Playa Grande, Playa Ventanas, Playa Langosta, the ocean out to 12 nautical miles, wetlands, highlands, and the coast inland to 125 m from the high tide line. The Leatherback Trust also supports other sea turtle conservation initiatives throughout Costa Rica and around the world. The Leatherback Trust currently supports conservation projects for the leatherback, green and olive ridley sea turtles in Costa Rica; leatherback and loggerhead sea turtles in South Africa; loggerhead sea turtles in Greece; and hawksbill sea turtles in the US Virgin Islands. Las Baulas National Marine Park Las Baulas National Marine Park was formed by a Presidential decree in 1991 and officially confirmed by law in 1995.Spotila, J.R., Paladino, F.V. (2004) Parque Marino Las Baulas. In Biodiversity conservation in Costa Rica: learning the lessons in a seasonal dry forest by Frankie, G.W., Mata, A., Vinson, S.B. University of California Press. Prior to the creation of the park almost 100% of all the sea turtles eggs laid in the region were collected illegally (poaching), but now this has been effectively ended.Santidri√°n Tomillo, P., Saba, V.S., Piedra, R., Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R. (2008) Effects of illegal harvest of eggs on the population decline of leatherback turtles in Las Baulas Marine National Park, Costa Rica. Conservation Biology 22: 1216 ‚Äì 1224. To achieve this, the Park trained former poachers as eco-tour guides. Those guides now take tourists to see nesting sea turtles. Las Baulas National Marine Park now hosts guided sea turtle tours over the entire leatherback sea turtles nesting season, spanning from October until March. The Leatherback Trust played a key role in supporting the government of Costa Rica in compensating landowners for property that was within the national park. Owners cannot build or otherwise disturb that land so it is reasonable that they receive fair compensation for the land, which then becomes part of the Park. The Leatherback Trust also recently embarked on an environmental education program at the local and national level. Outreach initiatives Two of the most successful public outreach programs cosponsored by The Leatherback Trust were The Great Sea Turtle Race and Cheer For The Turtles. The Great Sea Turtle Race used data from satellite tracked leatherback turtles leaving their nesting beaches at Playa Grande and heading to their feeding areas south of the Galapagos Islands. Using the tracking date a hypothetical race was staged between the turtles, with the winner being the turtle who reached the Galapagos Islands first. The race, co-sponsored by Conservation International, occurred on the Internet during 2007 with the turtles sponsored by several corporations, universities and schools.http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/leatherback- race.html#cr.

A second Race, also co-sponsored by Conservation International, took place in 2008 and a third was hosted by National Geographic Society in 2009. Cheer For The Turtles used data from the nesting leatherback turtle monitoring program conducted yearly at Playa Grande. Over the duration of the 2010/11 nesting season, weekly updates were provided on the nesting status (e.g. number of eggs laid per nest, number of nests etc.) of the first 6 turtles that were encountered that season.

Odulele was convicted of two counts of sexual assault in 2011, against two males, one of whom was under 16 years of age. In 2016, the 52 year old Albert Odulele started a church in Nigeria. This raised a number of speculations in both the Nigerian and British press with regards to his persistent child molesting inclinations and the impact this could have on innocent children. A number of warnings were issued by many conventional and social media outlets to parents, as it is feared that this notorious convicted child sex offender may seek to further abuse innocent children in Nigeria. Early career Odulele graduated from Ogun State University (now Olabisi Onabanjo University) in Nigeria with a Bachelor of Science in Medicine. Following his relocation to the United Kingdom, Odulele founded the evangelical London church, Glory House which was initially established as Glory Bible church in 1993 from a former funeral home in Leyton, East London. Criminal conviction In February 2011, Channel 4 News reported that Odulele was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving two male youths, one of whom was a boy under 16 years of age. Odulele pleaded guilty and confessed that he had been battling with his sexuality for many years. Odulele was sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court to eight months in prison. Having served some of his sentence, Odulele was released early from jail on 29 July 2011. He since resumed his work as pastor of Glory House.

Biography Ibn Hibban was born in 270 AH (884 CE) in Bust or Bost in present-day southern Afghanistan (former name of Helmand province capital was bost or bust, its new name is Lashkargah). He studied Islamic sciences with many prominent scientists of the time, as al-Nasa'i, al-Hasan ibn Sufyan, Abu al-Ya'la al-Mosuli, al-Husayn ibn Idris al-Harawi, Abu al- Khalifa al-Jamhi, Imran ibn Musa ibn Madzhashi', Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Sufi, Ja'far ibn Ahmad al-Dimashqi, Abu Bakr ibn Khuzaymah etc. His students included Muhammad ibn Manda, Ab≈´ 'Abd-'AllƒÅh al-Hakim and others. Ibn Hibban Acting Qadi in Samarqand, well versed in fiqh, hadith and the sciences of astronomy, medicine and many other disciplines. According to his own words, whenever he was in Mashhad during distress, he would visit Imam Reza Shrine and ask for relief that would always come, ‚Äútime after time again‚Äù.Ibn Hibban, Kitab al Siqqat, volume 5, page 325 Ibn Faisal died in Bust on a Friday night, eight days before the end of the month of Shawwal in 354 AH. He was buried in his native town Bost or Bust (currently Lashkargah) in present-day southern Afghanistan. Theology When returning to Sijistan, after studying in Nishapur with Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban was opposed by some of the Hanbalis as he taught that God does not have limits, rejecting their anthropomorphic belief in al-Hadd lillah (limits for God). Furthermore, these local Hanbalis accused him of Zandaqa (heresy) for his statement al-Nubuwwa 'ilmun wa 'amal (prophecy consists of a knowledge and action). Due to this he left for Samarkand, where he became a Judge. One of his enemies, al-Sulaymani (d. 404/1014) claimed that Ibn Hibban owed his appointement to Samanid vizier Abu al-Tayyib al-Mu'sabi for whom he wrote a refutation of the Karmatis. Works Khatib al-Baghdadi recommended 40 books of his for study. Most of his works have however perished even though he made an effort to preserve them by leaving his house and library in Nishapur as a Waqf for the transmission of his books. His Tarikh al-Thikat, a work of Ilm al-Rijal, was utilised by hadith critics such as al-Dhahabi, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani etc. In total, Ibn Hibban wrote almost 60 books on different topics of Islamic Science but his master piece is Sahih Ibn Hibban (originally titled: Al-Musnad al-Sahih ala al-Takasim wa al-Anwa).

Along with the contemporary Jefferson School of Social Science, the CLS represented the \\"transformed and upgraded\\" successors of the \\"workers schools\\" of the 1920s and 1930s, e.g., New York Workers School. History During World War II, as part of Browderism, Communist Party USA Earl Browder established new communist \\"schools of social sciences\\" in major urban areas. On the East Coast, these schools included names of American patriots: the Sam Adams School (Boston), Tom Paine School of Social Sciences (Philadelphia), George Washington Carver School (Harlem, New York), Abraham Lincoln School (Chicago), and Jefferson School of Social Sciences (New York). West Coast schools used geographic names: the Pacific Northwest Labor School and the California Labor School.  Founding  The CLS was founded in August 1942, in premises above a car showroom at 678 Turk Street in San Francisco, and named for labor leader Tom Mooney, who had died on March 6th that year. It later moved to a 5-story building at 216 Market Street, and in 1947 bought premises at 240 Golden Gate Avenue. The school was supported by 72 trade unions, including members of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Its initial program \\"promised to analyze social, economic and political questions in light of the present world struggle against fascism\\". It also taught the arts: the teenage Maya Angelou had a scholarship to study dance and drama. The school taught students on many subjects such as labor organization, journalism, music, drama, history, women's studies, economics and industrial arts. Union officials and professors from Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley taught the courses at CLS. The most popular course at the CLS called \\"Mental Hygiene Today\\" was taught by Erik Erikson. The most important history course was called \\"History and Problems of the Negro in America\\". The school offered different kinds of services such as preparing union pamphlets and newspapers, conducting dance concerts and theatrical shows at local meetings. Funding The largest funder of the CLS was the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), headed by Harry Bridges. The American Federation of Labor (AFL), Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), American Veterans Committee, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) also supported it.  People's Educational Center  From 1944 to 1948, the school ran a \\"counterpart\\" or \\"extension\\" called the \\"People's Educational Center\\" (or \\"Peoples Educational Center). Its head was Dorothy Healey, head of the Communist Party of Los Angeles. Frances Eisenberg of Canoga Park High School served on its board of directors. John Lawson was an instructor there. Robert E. Stripling stated that the center succeed the writers school of the League of American Writers. Sam Wood testified that Edward Dmytryk taught there. Oliver Carlson testified that William Wolfe of the ILGWU education department ran it, succeeded by Sidney Davison (sent from New York); Herbert Biberman taught there (Soviet theater), as did Guy Endore Robert Lees. Advisors included Lees, Lawson, Healey, Herbert Sorrell, Frank Tuttle, and Sondra Gorney.  Attendance and closure  From 1945 to 1947 the school was accredited for veterans' education under the G.I. Bill of Rights, and by 1947 there were 220 full-time students, among the 1800 students attending 135 classes. In 1948 the school was placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations and attendances declined. The school closed in 1957.

He also helped build several local railroads, such as the North and West Branch Railway and also owned many coal mines. By the time of his death, he was one of the most well-known people in northeastern Pennsylvania. He helped increasing the population and industrialization of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He also organized and created a number of churches in Pennsylvania. Waller was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and attended the Wilkes-Barre Academy, Williams College, and the Princeton Theological Seminary. He spent most of his life in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, where he died. He was ordained in 1839 and attended General Assemblies of the Presbyterian Church in addition to preaching in Columbia County. He retired from preaching in 1871 and most of his involvement in industrial and commercial work started at this point, including involvement in the railroad and the coal industries. He died in 1893 at the age of 78. Early life and education Waller was born on January 26, 1815, in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania, the oldest of five children. He was born to Phineas Waller and Elizabeth Jewett and was descended from early settlers of Massachusetts and Connecticut. His ancestors moved to Pennsylvania two generations before his birth. When he was eight years old, his father moved to Oquago, New York, while he and his half-brother Nathan remained in Pennsylvania. He then went to live with his aunts Rachel and Sally, enabling him to attend the Wilkes-Barre Academy and avoid his mother, who was an alcoholic. Waller attended the Wilkes-Barre Academy and received good grades, despite what historian William M. Ballie called a \\"prickly\\" personality. However, he received good grades in school. Waller taught Sunday school while in his early teens. When he was 15, he attended Williams College, from which he graduated in 1834. At Williams College, he came near to being expelled after arguing with a teacher. After Williams College, he considered being a lawyer, businessman or government worker. His brother William advised against his becoming a government worker or businessman, so he decided to become a minister. He attended the Princeton Theological Seminary starting in October 1834 and continuing for three years. Here he also came near to being expelled after a dispute with the teacher John Breckenridge. He graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1837 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Waller moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1838. Service to the church In 1838, the Presbyterian Church in Milton, Pennsylvania requested Waller's service, but he instead began preaching in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He also preached in Wilkes-Barre and Lancaster in late 1838 and in Danville and Milton in early 1839. On May 1, 1839, he was ordained in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. His Presbyterian ministry began on a church on Third Street in Bloomsburg. When he began preaching, his ministry covered all of Columbia County, as well as an area from Danville to the Wyoming Valley. In 1840, he stopped preaching at Briar Creek and Berwick, as they became part of a separate ministry. In 1842, he began preaching in Orangeville and New Columbia. he preached in Espy since at least 1857. Due to the size of his ministry, he was never able to preach at a given church more than once every two weeks and only preached at most churches once a month. He typically traveled approximately 5000 miles per year to preach or conduct funerals. Initially his salary was $600. Waller was a counsel in ecclesiastical trials. He went to the General Assemblies in 1844, 1853, 1861, 1865 to 1867, 1876, 1886, and 1890. He was interested in foreign missions and devoted one service per month to news from foreign missions and was elected to a four-year term on the Board of Foreign Missions in 1865. He was elected to be the Moderator of Presbytery in 1842, 1851, and 1881. At that time he was the only person to be elected to that position more than once. In addition to preaching at churches, Waller also revived, organized, or founded a number of them. In 1839, he revived the Hidlay Church, near Briar Creek, and a church at Berwick. He and two other people officially organized the Presbyterian church in Orangeville in October 1843. He and three others also attempted unsuccessfully to organize a church it Catawissa. In 1856, he traveled to Schuylkill County and preached in churches there numerous times and in 1857, he and two other people organized a church in Ashland in Schuylkill County. Land purchase and sale Waller owned 20 percent (900 acres) of the land in Bloomsburg at various times during his life, which is more than any other person has held in the town to date. He also owned land in other parts of Columbia County and the Wyoming Valley. his lands in Bloomsburg primarily included northeastern, southeastern, and south-central Bloomsburg, but also included some small areas of land near Bloomsburg's border with Hemlock Township. He sold some of his land, but also donated parts of it by selling those areas for $1. Waller developed a number of community features on this land, including five churches, the Columbia County Courthouse and Jail, and several industries such as the Magee Carpet Company and the Bloomsburg Silk Mills. In 1870, he sold three acres of land on Seventh Street in Bloomsburg for the purpose of building a park, but the land was instead used for athletic competitions. In 1890, he sold two lots at the corner of Sixth Street and Iron Street to Paul E. Wirt, a fountain pen manufacturer. He also hired the town engineer Samuel Neyhard to develop Bloomsburg from Fifth Street to the Susquehanna River. Most of this work was done after Waller was no longer a minister. In 1869, Waller purchased 330 acres of land along Fishing Creek from the Bloomsburg Iron Company and for $3000 and later sold it for $19,037. He sold some land in Mount Pleasant Township for a place to house poor people. He also made a number of a number of purchases of land near the end of his life, including 93 acres at the confluence of Fishing Creek and Raven Creek in 1890 and 22.5 acres along the Susquehanna River in Scott Township and Bloomsburg in May 1893. In 1854, Waller and two other people were chosen to find a location for Bloomsburg's Rosemont Cemetery. They chose a hill immediately north of Bloomsburg, which was partly his land, so on August 1, 1855 he sold them 2 acres and 33.5 perches of land to the Rosemont Cemetery Company for $490. He was president of the company from 1856 to his death in 1893. Work in industries Waller was also involved in matters related the local railroads. On October 3, 1877, he sold some of his land in Bloomsburg to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for the purpose of a new railroad station. He was also involved in the building of the North and West Branch Railway between 1880 and 1881. He started raising money for this railroad in 1872 and broke the ground for the railroad in March 1872. Waller put most of his money into the building of the North and West Branch Railway. The work on the railroad stopped during the Panic of 1873 but resumed in 1880. The North and West Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 but he managed to regain much of the company. The company was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad on November 23, 1881, but remained its own company for approximately 20 years. He was president of the North and West Branch Railway in the 1880s. In 1888, he sold a piece of land to the town of Bloomsburg for the purpose of building the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad through it. It was he who initially conceived the idea of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad. Waller also successfully convinced the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad to move its Bloomsburg station to his land on Market Street. Waller was involved in the process of mining anthracite and owned large tracts of coal-containing land. In 1837, he invested jointly in an area of coal-containing land in Plymouth Township (now Larksville) with his uncle, Oristus Collins. He and Collins divided the land into their own parcels in 1840. He and several of his siblings also bought a piece of coal-mining land from his father for $10,000 in 1857. Waller gradually bought the coal-containing lots of his siblings until he had close to 250 acres of land with coal in 1872. In 1878, he purchased 28 acres of coal-mining land in Plymouth Township from Joseph Jaquish's heirs. Altogether his coal-mining lands outputted 50,000 tons (45,454 tonnes) per year, although this was only a small portion of the total coal output of the Wyoming Valley. After retiring as a minister he also purchased 2000 acres of coal-mining land near Chattanooga. Other work In 1834, Waller went to New York City to be a tutor, but left after three or four weeks. This was the last time in his life that he was paid as a teacher but he still opened and funded some schools. He opened a classical school in Bloomsburg, which was built in 1839, and he contributed $3500 to it. Shortly after arriving in Bloomsburg, he organized a singing school and also created a Bible class in 1839. The class continued until after his death. He helped to open Bloomsburg's State Normal School. He was appointed a trustee of Lafayette College in 1849 by the Synod of Philadelphia. He held that position until 1879. He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and Means committee and helped stop the college from closing in 1852. In 1856, Waller helped convert a classical school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute and served as one of the nine initial trustees. He resigned from being a trustee in 1866 after a dispute about where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, he helped conduct the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867. In 1876, Waller ran as a Republican candidate for US Congress. He lost the election by 8376 votes to Democratic lawyer Francis Dolan Collins. He did, however, win Columbia County in the election. He was also the proprietor of a furnace on Roaring Creek and built the Bloomsburg Sanitarium at the corner of Sixth Street and Market Street in Bloomsburg in 1870. Waller was vice president of the State Agricultural Society. He also extended Market Street in Bloomsburg and built many houses along it. Along with John Ramsay, he built First Street in Bloomsburg and sold the lots on it to Welsh immigrants some time before 1847. He also laid out other residential streets in Bloomsburg. He supported moving the county seat of Columbia County from Danville to Bloomsburg,At that time Montour County, which Danville is in, was part of Columbia County. although he was unable to convince Danville's businessmen to move their industries to Bloomsburg. In 1866, he was made one of three trustees of Bloomsburg's Board of Trade. Personal life On May 23, 1839, Waller married Philadelphian Julia Ellmaker. He first met Ellmaker while visiting friends in Philadelphia during his time at the Princeton Theological Seminary. The couple had nine children between 1840 and 1858, six of whom survived to adulthood, and five of whom were alive at the time of his death. He lived at the corner of 5th and Market Streets in Bloomsburg, although at one point he owned much of the land between 4th Street, the Susquehanna River, Railroad Street, and Ferry Road in Bloomsburg. In 1871, he suffered a driving accident and was temporarily injured. He was in another accident in 1875 and due to this, he needed to walk with crutches for the remainder of his life. Waller also suffered from rheumatism and neuralgia due to extensive traveling. He retired from being a minister on April 16, 1871. He died in on December 7, 1893, at the age of 79. The services for his death were held in his home. The historian J.H. Battle made note of Waller's hospitality. He was interested in geology and another Presbyterian minister gave him a large mineralogy-related collection in 1848. Legacy On the day of Waller's funeral, businesses in Bloomsburg closed from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., a unique honor in the town's history. He was buried in the Old Rosemont Cemetery. During his lifetime, Waller made 25 purchases and 130 sales of land. By 1887 the area that he owned between 4th and 9th Streets in Bloomsburg were home to more than 200 houses. The community of Waller, Pennsylvania is named after him. In his two-column obituary in Bloomsburg's newspaper, it was stated that \\"No other man has left or probably will leave a greater impression on this community that he [Waller] did\\". There is a stained glass window that features Waller on a church in Bloomsburg. Approximately 20 of his sermons still survive. He was also the creator of the Waller Trust, which existed until the 1970s.

History The scheme was introduced in 2000 for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), with a separate scheme for large companies launched in 2002 (see R&D; Expenditure Credit or Above the Line R&D; Tax Relief). Any company carrying out R&D; is likely to qualify for the relief. The definitions of eligible R&D; and eligible costs are reasonably broad, and eligible R&D; activities often take place across the whole range of company operations. Many other countries worldwide (e.g. Canada,Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Credit Program France, the USAResearch & Experimentation Tax Credit) already operated schemes to promote corporate R&D; investment by the time the UK scheme commenced. The UK government wanted to increase the UK R&D; base by helping to reduce the cost of corporate R&D; and thereby encourage companies to invest in R&D.; In turn, this would increase innovation and wealth creation in the economy. There are two main types of R&D; incentive structure: volume- based, where the credit is based on the absolute volume of R&D; expenditure; and incremental-based, where the credit is driven by the increase in R&D; spending over a base figure. The UK scheme is volume-based because the incremental approach provides limited or no encouragement to businesses whose R&D; spending fluctuates or remains at a steady level (for instance in times of macro-economic volatility). Overview The net benefit after tax of the relief ranges from 7.7 per cent to 32.63 per cent of eligible expenditure depending on whether the claimant is a large or small profitable or loss making company. The definitions of large and small company size are driven by the EU classifications (and adjusted for UK R&D; Tax Credit purposes) including revenues, number of employees and balance sheet assets. The SME scheme works by allowing the SME to deduct an additional 130 per cent of its eligible R&D; costs from its taxable income (a superdeduction). If the company has made a loss, then the scheme goes even further and allows the alternative of a cash payment of up to 32.63 per cent of the eligible R&D; investment. The rate of the SME R&D; tax credit enhancement has increased from 150 per cent when it was first introduced in 2000 to the rate of 225 per cent as at 2013. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his 2014 Autumn Statement that the super deduction rate for the SME relief regime has been increased from 225% to 230%, on expenditure incurred from 1 April 2015, providing a benefit of 26% of the qualifying expenditure.2014 Autumn Statement, \\"2014 Autumn Statement\\" Retrieved 01 March 2015 The rate at which losses can be surrendered for a payable tax credit under the SME scheme remains at 14.5%, meaning loss making SME‚Äôs can receive a cash credit of 33.35 pence (previously 32.63 pence) for every pound spent on qualifying R&D.; A large company is able to claim an additional 30 per cent of its eligible R&D; costs from its taxable income as a superdeduction. And with effect for qualifying expenditure incurred after 1 April 2013, the government introduced a new Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) which operates above the tax line, and until 2016, alongside the existing superdeduction scheme. The RDEC scheme makes it possible for large companies to claim a payable tax credit at a rate of 10 per cent of qualifying expenditure (rising to 11 per cent of qualifying expenditure incurred from 1 April 2015). This was further increased to 12% from 1 January 2018.

He was editor of Newsweek in the 1950s, executive editor of the New York Herald Tribune (1961-1964), and an executive vice president of Hill and Knowlton (1969-1978), the largest public relations firm in the world at the time. Early life Fulbright was born on April 26, 1925 in Atlanta, Georgia, to Ernest Alexander Fulbright and Lessie Freeman Fulbright, both of North Carolina. The family moved back to North Carolina soon after their son's birth, settling in Durham. Fulbright's father was originally a traveling salesman, but with the onset of the Depression lost work and subsequently left the family, ultimately joined the US Merchant Marine service in 1937, and died of a ruptured appendix in a hospital in Calcutta on April 10, 1943 after sailing in a convoy from the US East Coast. Fulbright was thereafter raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, Minerva \\"Minnie\\" Freeman. Fulbright graduated from Durham High School, where he received high marks and was editor of the school newspaper. He was accepted to Duke University, but was unable to attend due to financial constraints.Who's Who in America, 1977-78, page 1088 Newspaper, wire service, and magazine career Fulbright started his newspaper career as a sportswriter for the Durham Morning Herald in 1941 while still in high school. After graduating from Durham High School and receiving a 1H deferment from the draft due to a heart murmur, he worked for the Cincinnati Post from 1944 to 1945. In 1945 he signed on with the late International News Service (INS) as legislative correspondent covering the Ohio state legislature in Columbus, Ohio. He moved to Chicago with INS in 1947 as a news editor, and then to Washington, DC in 1951 as a political correspondent. In 1952 Fulbright was assigned by INS to cover Democrat Adlai Stevenson Jr. in his campaign for President of the United States running against Dwight Eisenhower. Fulbright's fellow wire-service reporters on the Stevenson campaign were Merriman Smith of United Press (UP) and Jack Bell of Associated Press (AP). The INS White House correspondent position was opening in 1953, and INS promised that position to the correspondent of the winning Presidential candidate. The INS correspondent covering Eisenhower was Bob Clark (television reporter), who went on to be a political reporter with ABC-TV News. With Eisenhower's victory, Fulbright was made Night Managing Editor in the New York City office, which had been his ultimate destination. He served in that role from 1952 to 1955. During this time William Randolph Hearst Jr. wrote about him, \\"Editors like Milt Kaplan, Phil Reed, Paul Allerup, Freeman Fulbright, and others took second place to no one in the business.\\".William Randolph Hearst, Jr., The Hearsts: Father and Son, 1981, page 301 Fulbright joined the staff of Newsweek in 1957, first as editor of its popular and flagship \\"Periscope\\" section, and then as a general editor. It was at Newsweek that Fulbright came to the attention of editor-in- chief John Denson. Fulbright and Denson worked closely together at Newsweek, then left together in 1961 to take over editor responsibilities at the New York Herald Tribune, long considered one of the best-written papers in the country, but suffering from declining circulation. Denson served as editor-in- chief and Fulbright as executive editor of the \\"Trib\\". Denson brought a fresh and edgier style to the paper, particularly in the graphic design of the front page, but was unable to reverse declining circulation trends, and the 1962 newspaper strike delivered a mortal blow to that paper. Denson was forced out by owner John Whitney, and Fulbright \\"[fell] devotedly on his sword\\".Richard Kluger, The Paper: the Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune, 1986, page 646 . Public relations career After leaving INS and before joining Newsweek, Fulbright worked at New York-based public relations firm Walker & Crenshaw as a vice president and general manager from 1955 to 1957. With the decline of the New York newspaper industry and the demise of the New York Herald Tribune, New York Journal American, and New York World Sun, opportunities as a newspaper editor were limited, and so Fulbright joined public relations firm Selvage and Lee (subsequently to become Manning, Selvage and Lee) as senior vice president in 1962, promoted to executive vice president in 1966. He served in that role until 1969, and grew revenues and the client list over that period. In 1969 he joined Hill and Knowlton as a senior vice president, then became one of six executive vice presidents in 1973. At this time Hill and Knowlton (known as \\"H&K;\\" in the industry) was the largest public relations firm in the world. Fulbright primarily handled financial relations for clients, including Gillette, Ernst & Ernst, Lincoln National Insurance, Russell Athletic, Mattel, Cities Service, Reserve Oil & Gas, The Richmond Company, and LouAna. Fulbright died of a massive heart attack in the Hill and Knowlton offices in New York on June 6, 1978. Personal life Fulbright met his future wife Jane Meese in Chicago in 1947, and the pair was married in 1948. His wife survived him by three years, dying in 1981. They had two children, daughter Carolyn Frances Fulbright Fried, born in 1953 and deceased in 2008, and son Charles Cary Freeman Fulbright, born in 1957. Fulbright was active in his church, serving as a trustee of Rutgers Presbyterian Church on West 73rd Street in New York. He was a member of the National Press Club, Sigma Delta Chi, and the Wings Club. He is buried with his wife and her parents in East Avenue Cemetery in New Philadelphia, Ohio, with the words \\"I Did It May Way\\" on the tombstone. The Fulbright Library at the Bay School of San Francisco is named in memory of Jane and Freeman Fulbright.

As with quality in other fields, it is an assessment of whether something is good enough and whether it is suitable for its purpose. The goal of health care is to provide medical resources of high quality to all who need them; that is, to ensure good quality of life, cure illnesses when possible, to extend life expectancy, and so on. Researchers use a variety of quality measures to attempt to determine health care quality, including counts of a therapy's reduction or lessening of diseases identified by medical diagnosis, a decrease in the number of risk factors which people have following preventive care, or a survey of health indicators in a population who are accessing certain kinds of care.  Definition  Health care quality is the degree to which health care services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes. Quality of care plays an important role in describing the iron triangle of health care relationships between quality, cost, and accessibility of health care within a community. Researchers measure health care quality to identify problems caused by overuse, underuse, or misuse of health resources. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released six domains to measure and describe quality of care in health: # safe ‚Äì avoiding injuries to patients from care that is intended to help them # effective ‚Äì avoiding overuse and misuse of care # patient-Centered ‚Äì providing care that is unique to a patient's needs # timely ‚Äì reducing wait times and harmful delays for patients and providers # efficient ‚Äì avoiding waste of equipment, supplies, ideas and energy # equitable ‚Äì providing care that does not vary across intrinsic personal characteristics While essential for determining the effect of health services research interventions, measuring quality of care poses some challenges due to the limited number of outcomes that are measurable. Structural measures describe the providers' ability to provide high quality care, process measures describe the actions taken to maintain or improve community health, and outcome measures describe the impact of a health care intervention. Furthermore, due to strict regulations placed on health services research, data sources are not always complete. Assessment of health care quality may occur on two different levels: that of the individual patient and that of populations. At the level of the individual patient, or micro-level, assessment focuses on services at the point of delivery and its subsequent effects. At the population level, or macro-level, assessments of health care quality include indicators such as life expectancy, infant mortality rates, incidence, and prevalence of certain health conditions.Shi L, Singh DA. Delivering Health Care in America: a Systems Approach. 6th ed. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett; 2015 Quality assessments measure these indicators against an established standard. The measures can be difficult to define in health care..  Methods to assess and improve  The Donabedian model is a common framework for assessing health care quality and identifies three domains in which health care quality can be assessed: structure, process, and outcomes. All three domains are tightly linked and build on each other. Improvements in structure and process are often observed in outcomes. Some examples of improvements in process are: clinical practice guidelines, analysis of cost efficiency, and risk management, which consists of proactive steps to prevent medical errors. Cost Efficiency Cost Efficiency, or cost effectiveness, determines whether the benefits of a service exceed the cost incurred to provide the service. A health care service is sometimes not cost efficient due to either overutilization or underutilization. Overutilization, or overuse, occurs when the value of health care is diluted with wasted resources. Consequently, depriving someone else of the potential benefits from obtaining the service. Costs or risks of treatment outweigh the benefits in overused health care. In contrast, underutilization, or underuse, occurs when the benefits of a treatment outweigh the risks or costs, but it is not used. There are potential adverse health outcomes with underutilization. One example is the lack of early cancer detection and treatment which leads to decreased cancer survival rates. Critical Pathways Critical Pathways are outcome-based and patient- centered case management tools that take on an interdisciplinary approach by \\"facilitating coordination of care among multiple clinical departments and caregivers\\". Health care managers utilize critical pathways as a method to reduce variation in care, decrease resource utilization, and improve quality of care. Using critical pathways to reduce costs and errors improves quality by providing a systematic approach to assessing health care outcomes. Reducing variations in practice patterns promotes improved collaboration among interdisciplinary players in the health care system.  Health professional perspective  The quality of the health care given by a health professional can be judged by its outcome, the technical performance of the care and by interpersonal relationships. \\"Outcome\\" is a change in patients' health, such as reduction in pain, relapses, or death rates. Large differences in outcomes can be measured for individual medical providers, and smaller differences can be measured by studying large groups, such as low- and high-volume doctors. Significant initiatives to improve healthcare quality outcomes have been undertaken that include clinical practice guidelines, cost efficiency, critical pathways, and risk management. Clinical Practice Guideline \\"Technical performance\\" is the extent to which a health professional conformed to the best practices established by medical guidelines. Clinical practice guidelines, or medical practice guidelines, are scientifically based protocols to assist providers in adopting a \\"best practice\\" approach in delivering care for a given health condition. Standardizing the practice of medicine improves quality of care by concurrently promoting lower costs and better outcomes. The presumption is providers following medical guidelines are giving the best care and give the most hope of a good outcome. Technical performance is judged from a quality perspective without regard to the actual outcome - so for example, if a physician gives care according to the guidelines but a patient's health does not improve, then by this measure, the quality of the \\"technical performance\\" is still high. For example a Cochrane review found that computer generated reminders improved doctors' adherence to guidelines and standard of care; but lacked evidence to determine whether or not this actually impacted patient centered health outcomes. Risk Management Risk management consists of \\"proactive efforts to prevent adverse events related to clinical care\\" and is focused on avoiding medical malpractice. Health care professionals are not immune to lawsuits; therefore, health care organizations have taken initiatives to establish protocols specifically to reduce malpractice litigation. Malpractice concerns can result in defensive medicine, or threat of malpractice litigation, which can compromise patient safety and care by inducing additional testing or treatments. One widely used form of defensive medicine is ordering costly imaging which can be wasteful. However, other defensive behaviors may actually reduce access to care and pose risks of physical harm. Many specialty physicians report doing more for patients, such as using unnecessary diagnostic tests, because of malpractice risks. In turn, it is especially crucial that risk management approaches employ principles of cost efficiency with standardized practice guidelines and critical pathways.  Patient perspective  Patient satisfaction surveys are the main qualitative measure of the patient perspective. Patients may not have the clinical judgement of physicians and often judge quality on the basis of practitioner's concern and demeanor, among other things. As a result, patient satisfaction surveys have become a somewhat controversial measure of quality care. Proponents argue that patient surveys can provide needed feedback to physicians to assist on improving their practice. In addition, patient satisfaction often correlates with patient involvement in decision making and can improve patient-centered care. Patients' evaluation of care can identify opportunities for improvement in care, reducing costs, monitoring performance of health plans, and provide a comparison across health care institutions. Opponents of patient satisfaction surveys are often unconvinced that the data is reliable, that the expense does not justify the costs, and that what is measured is not a good indicator of quality. The Department of Health and Human Services bases 30 percent of hospitals' Medicare reimbursement on patient satisfaction survey scores on a survey, known as the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS). \\"Beginning in October 2012, the Affordable Care Act implemented a policy that withholds 1 percent of total Medicare reimbursements‚Äîapproximately $850 million‚Äîfrom hospitals (that percentage will double in 2017). Each year, only hospitals with high patient- satisfaction scores and a measure of certain basic care standards will earn that money back, and top performers receive bonuses from the pool.\\"  Technology and security perspective  Technology also may affect patients' perception of health care quality. A 2015 survey of cancer patients shows that those who have a more positive attitude towards the health information tools from their providers use the tools more and subsequently have a higher perceived care quality from their provider. The same survey also shows that those who believe their provider acts more securely and have a lower level of privacy concern are more likely to have a positive attitude towards the health information tools from their providers and thus a higher perception of the care they received.  History in the United States  As early as the 19th century, healthcare quality improvement interventions were implemented in an effort to improve healthcare outcomes. Healthcare quality improvement further developed in the 1900s, with notable improvements for the modern field of quality improvement taking place in the late 1960s. In the early 1900s, Dr. Ernest Codman of Massachusetts General Hospital suggested a measure that tracked each patient of the hospital to determine effectiveness of their treatment. His proposal of a system to track patient care to determine quality and standard of hospital care dubbed him one of the earliest advocates of healthcare quality. Shortly after, influenced by the work of Dr. Codman, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) was founded. In 1918, the ACS developed the Minimum Standard for Hospitals, which was one page. As a result of the 1918 Minimum Standard for Hospitals, ACS began performing on-site inspections of hospitals to determine if they were up to par. During the first on-site inspections of 692 hospitals, only 13% met the minimum standard. In 1945, Joseph Juran and Edwards Deming established Quality Improvement (QI) as a formal approach to analyzing systematic efforts to improve performance. Specifically, Deming, a philosopher, placed emphasis on the macro level of organizational management and improvement via a systems approach. Juran, on the other hand, strategized quality planning, control, and improvement at the micro level. He encouraged questions, believing they deepened understanding of problems and led to increased effectiveness in planning and taking action. Together, their work influenced quality of both American public and private organizations in fields from healthcare and industry to government and education. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) was established in 1951 as an independent and non-profit organization that provided voluntary accreditation to hospitals that met minimum quality standards. JCAH was formed by the combined forces of the American College of Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the Canadian Medical Association. In 1952, the ACS formally transferred its Hospital Standardization Program to JCAH. JCAH began to charge a fee for surveys in 1964. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 were passed by Congress in an attempt to grant hospitals accredited by JCAH \\"deemed status\\". As such, those same hospitals were said to meet the necessary requirements to participate in Medicare and Medicaid. Until 1966, when Avedis Donabedian, MD published his \\"Evaluating the Quality of Medical Care\\", the study of health care quality was based on structure (e.g., licensing, staffing levels, accreditation). Donabedian demonstrated a new perspective on analyzing healthcare quality that was based on structure, process, and outcome. The National Academy of Sciences established the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1970. The IOM, a non-profit and independent scientific advisor, was created to improve health on a national scale. The Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) formed in 1970 to improve healthcare quality for patients served by ambulatory health care organizations by setting standards for ambulatory healthcare accreditation, similar to JCAH. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was created in 1989 in order to improve quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care through research. In 1990, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) was entrusted to offer accreditation programs for managed care organizations. The NCQA was established as an independent non-profit dedicated to improving health care quality through accreditation and performance measurement. In 1991, Dr. Don Berwick's non- profit Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) was founded. Rather than only focus on national health care quality improvement, IHI campaigned but nationally and worldwide. Directing the focus onto the patient as a consumer, the National Patient Safety Foundation was established in 1996. In 1998, by presidential directive, the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force (QuIC) was created to increase coordination of federal agencies that work toward improving quality care. When the IOM published To Err is Human in 1999, revealing high medical error mortality rates, the QuIC published a report that inventoried regulatory and legislative initiatives that sought to improve issues surrounding medical error. Also in 1999, the National Quality Forum was founded. The private, non-profit forum aims to standardize health care delivery and measurements of quality. In response to the patient safety concerns discussed in To Err is Human, the United States enacted the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act in 2005. More recently, the focus of quality improvement has been emerging health information technology (e.g., electronic health records and patient-centered care. As a result, the formation of Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH) began to gain popularity in 2007. Under PCMH, care among personal primary care physicians and specialists increased coordination and integration of care for the patient. Furthermore, technology was used to maintain personal health information and enhance quality and safety. Since 2007, various studies have demonstrated the wide array of benefits of PCMHs in healthcare quality improvement.  Organizations which determine quality  Organizations which work to set standards and measures for health care quality include Government health systems; private health systems, accreditation programs such as those for hospital accreditation, health associations, or those who wish to establish international healthcare accreditation; philanthropic foundations; and health research institutions. These organizations seek to define the concept of quality in healthcare, measure that quality, and then encourage the regular measurement of quality so as to provide evidence that health interventions are effective.  In the United States  Multiple organizations have established measures to define quality since providers, patients and payers have different views and expectations of quality. This complex situation creates a challenge because most often the measures of quality are not comparable across organizations and there are issues of transferability and merging across systems. Consequently, while measuring health care quality for these reasons, high quality longitudinal provides a substantive framework from which health services researchers can work. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) designs quality evaluations, collects quality, and manages funding for the central government Medicare and Medicaid programs. In 2001, CMS started multiple quality initiatives including, but not limited to: the Home Health Quality Initiative, the Hospital Value-based Purchasing Program, the Hospice Quality Reporting Program, the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Quality Reporting, and the Long-Term Care Hospitals Quality Reporting. CMS established initiatives to measure and improve the quality of care for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries for services provided under the umbrella of Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program (EPSDT), including maternal and infant health, home and community-based services, preventative care, health disparities, patient safety, external quality review, and improving care transitions. For broader quality control, CMS also created Hospital Compare, which is a large public reporting program that measures and also reports processes of care and outcomes for various health care interventions including heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is a central government organization which collects public reports of health quality evaluation to increase the safety and quality of health care. AHRQ works together with the United States Department of Health and Human Services to make ensure that evidence is understood and used by the medical communities to elevate the quality of care. To fulfill its mission, AHRQ contracts with several subsites. CMS and AHRQ have collectively established the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. The CAHPS survey collects uniform measures of patients' perspectives on various aspects of the care they receive in inpatient settings. The results are published on the Hospital Compare website, which may be used by health care organizations and researchers to improve the quality of their services. Purchasers, consumers, and researchers may also use the data to make informed business choices. The Joint Commission Accreditation for Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) is a nonprofit organization that assesses quality at multiple levels by inspecting health care facilities for adherence to clinical guidelines, compliance with rules and regulations for medical staff skills and qualifications, review of medical records to evaluate care processes and search for medical errors, and inspects buildings for safety code violations. JCAHO also provides feedback and opportunities for improvement, while simultaneously issuing citations for closures of facilities deemed noncompliant with set measures of quality standards.  In the United Kingdom  In the UK, healthcare is publicly funded and delivered through the National Health Service (NHS) and quality is overseen by a number of different bodies. Monitor, a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of Health, is the sector regulator for health services in England. It works closely with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) a government-funded independent body responsible for overseeing the quality and safety of health and social care services in England, including hospitals, care homes, dental and GPs and other care services. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has a number of infrastructure programmes supporting quality in healthcare, including the Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs). Medical professions in the UK have their own membership and regulatory associations. These include the General Medical Council (GMC), the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the General Dental Council and the Health and Care Professions Council. Other healthcare quality organisations include the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), a charity and limited company established by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the Royal College of Nursing, National Voices; and Healthwatch, a statutory national body that works with groups across the country to ensure that patients' views are at the heart of decisions about the healthcare system. A number of health think tanks, including the King's Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation offer analysis, resources and commentary around healthcare quality. In 2013, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation launched QualityWatch, an independent research programme tracking how healthcare quality in England is changing in response to rising remand and limited funding.  In India  Healthcare quality efforts in India are beginning to gain strength.

Essentially these are hand-held VHF radio's that are used in any survival craft, such as a life boat or life raft. SCTs with re-chargeable type batteries may be used for on-board communications as well. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires the following from SCTs: * Must be able to be operated by unskilled personnel * Must be able to transmit and receive on 156.8 MHz (Channel 16) and 156.3 MHz (Channel 6) * Withstand a drop of 1 meter on a hard surface * Watertight to a depth of 1 meter for 5 minutes * Power Minimum of 0.25 watts * A power reduction switch to less than 1 watt must be available where power exceeds 1 watt * Antenna must be vertically polarized and omni-directional * Battery power capacity for 8 hours on a 1:9 duty cycle The SCTs used for everyday operations have a rechargeable NiCad battery, and some radios that are strictly SCTs use a non- rechargeable lithium battery pack. These batteries must be replaced on or before the manufactures marked expiration date. SCTs are required to be capable of radiating a minimum radio frequency (RF) power of 250mW (milliwatts) A switch must be provided on the SCT if the transmitter has a power excess of one watt, this will allow the operator to reduce the power to less than one watt, resulting in a reduced battery power loss. Along with other requirements the IMO has made it mandatory that the antenna be vertically polarized, allowing all radio antennas to be within the same plane, this ensures that the energy transfer from each radio is high. The IMO requires that cargo ships between 300 and 500 gross tons must carry two SCTs. Passenger ships carrying more than 12 passengers on international voyages, and cargo ships of 500 tons or more must carry three SCTs.

In addition to the core econometric tools for analysis of cross sections and time series, LIMDEP supports methods for panel data analysis, frontier and efficiency estimation and discrete choice modeling. The package also provides a programming language to allow the user to specify, estimate and analyze models that are not contained in the built in menus of model forms.  History  LIMDEP was first developed in the early 1980s. Econometric Software, Inc. was founded in 1985 by William H. Greene. The program was initially developed as an easy to use tobit estimator‚Äîhence the name, LIMited DEPendent variable models. Econometric Software has continually expanded since the early 1980s and currently has locations in the United States and Australia. The ongoing development of LIMDEP has been based partly on interaction and feedback from users and from the collaboration of many researchers. LIMDEP is used by researchers in universities, government institutions, and businesses. LIMDEP has spun off a major suite of programs for the estimation of discrete choice models, NLOGIT, now a self standing superset of LIMDEP.  User interface  The main functionality of the program is accessed through a command line interface. Command streams are provided to the program via scripts or as text processed in a text editing format. It also includes a graphical user interface within which all program features can be accessed via menus or command generating dialog boxes. All GUI command generators produce transportable scripts that can be reused and modified in the command editor.  Data input, formats and storage  Any number of data sets may be analyzed simultaneously. Data are input via standard ASCII formats such as CSV, DIF and rectangular ASCII, as well as XLS, Stata DTA (some versions) and binary. Data may be exported in CSV, rectangular ASCII and binary formats. The native save format (LPJ) has not changed since the release of the Windows version in 1997. All versions may exchange data sets. Data storage and all computations are always in double precision. Active data set size limitation is imposed by the available memory.  List server  LIMDEP supports a list server based discussion group.List Server Anyone (users and interested nonusers) may subscribe to the list server. The list server is maintained at the University of Sydney.  Models  There are model formulations for linear and nonlinear regression, robust estimation, discrete choice (including binary choice, ordered choice and unordered multinomial choice), censoring and truncation, sample selection, loglinear models, survival analysis, quantile regression (linear and count), panel data, stochastic frontier and data envelopment analysis, count data, and time series.  Data Analysis  Analysis of a data set is done interactively in a set of windows. Program control may be from a pull down menu or in an unstructured session of instructions and manipulations. Estimation involves: * Data management, including input from standard sources (such as Excel), transformations and sample controls * Programming language, matrix algebra package and scientific calculator * Random number generation, matrix for bootstrapping, Gibbs sampling and Monte Carlo simulation * Graphical and numeric descriptive statistics analysis * Optimization tools for maximum likelihood, GMM, or maximum simulated likelihood estimators * Post estimation tools for simulation, hypothesis testing, and partial effects * Computational methods that match the National Institute of Standards and Technology test problems  Resources  The PDF documentation set includes reference guides for the operation, background econometrics, and sample applications.

The church was previously located on Little Green, close to Richmond Green, in a Grade II listed building designed in a Gothic Revival style by William Wallace in 1883 and built from 1884 to 1885. That building remains but has been adapted for residential use. The church became a United Reformed Church (URC) in 1972, following the union of the Presbyterian Church of England and the Congregational Church of England and Wales. From October 2006 the congregation of Richmond Green United Reformed Church met for worship in a new building in Quadrant Road, behind the previous church building. It was joined by members of the former East Sheen United Reformed Church, a congregation dating from the 17th century, which had previously been meeting in a building in Vernon Road, dating from 1902. Designed by F C Howgate and originally known as the Congregational Church, East Sheen, it was noted for its Doulton terracotta work and plaques. The London Borough of Richmond granted planning permission in March 2012 for the conversion of the first floor Sunday school building to provide five self-contained flats.

Comprising fifteen books and over 250 myths, the poem chronicles the history of the world from its creation to the deification of Julius Caesar within a loose mythico-historical framework. Although meeting the criteria for an epic, the poem defies simple genre classification by its use of varying themes and tones. Considered one of the most influential works of art in Western culture, particularly European, Metamorphoses has inspired such authors as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio. Numerous episodes from the poem have been depicted in sculptures and paintings by artists such as Titian. Although Ovid's reputation faded after the Renaissance, towards the end of the twentieth century there was a resurgence of interest in his work; today, Metamorphoses continues to inspire and be retold through various media. Literature Drama Pygmalion (November 1914). * The myth of Pygmalion and Galatea (Book X) has been adapted into plays by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Pygmalion, 1762), W.S. Gilbert (Pygmalion and Galatea, an Original Mythological Comedy, 1871) and George Bernard Shaw (Pygmalion, premiered October 1913). Gilbert's play was parodied in the musical burlesque Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed (1883) Shaw's play‚Äîin which phonetics professor Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a Cockney flower girl to pass for a duchess by improving her speech‚Äîwas adapted by Shaw himself into a film version (Pygmalion, 1938), the screenplay of which was later adapted into the Lerner and Loewe musical My Fair Lady (1956), itself adapted into a 1964 musical film. * In 2002, author Mary Zimmerman adapted some of Ovid's myths into a play by the same title, and the open-air-theatre group London Bubble also adapted it in 2006. * Naomi Iizuka's Polaroid Stories also bases its format on Metamorphoses, adapting Ovid's poem to modern times with drug- addicted, teenage versions of many of the characters from the original play. * Acis and Galatea, a masque by H√§ndel, is based on the eponymous characters out of the Metamorphoses, as is Lully's opera Acis et Galat√©e. * In 2010, the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre presented a new adaptation of Metamorphoses at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.http://www.yvonne-arnaud.co.uk/studio.asp?s=708 Novels and other literature * In 1613, Spanish poet Luis de G√≥ngora wrote an illustrious poem titled La F√°bula de Polifemo y Galatea that retells the story of Polyphemus, Galatea and Acis found in Book XIII of the Metamorphoses. * In 1988, author Christoph Ransmayr reworked a great number of characters from the Metamorphoses in his The Last World. * In 1997, the British poet laureate Ted Hughes adapted twenty-four stories from the Metamorphoses into his volume of poetry Tales from Ovid. This was later adapted for the stage in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1999, the year after Hughes's death. * In 2000, author Phillip Terry edited a collection of modern adaptations of some of Ovid's myths as Ovid Metamorphosed.

Visual art Diana and Actaeon, Titian, 1556-59 (National Gallery, London). * Bacchus and Ariadne (1522‚Äì23), an oil painting by Titian produced for Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, depicts the story of Ariadne and Bacchus described in Book VIII. During his later years (1550‚Äì1576), Titian painted a series of large mythological paintings known as the \\"poesie\\" for Philip II of Spain. The \\"poesie\\" series, which depicts scenes from Ovid, contained the following works: Venus and Adonis (Book X), Dana√´ (Book IV), Diana and Actaeon (Book III), Diana and Callisto, Perseus and Andromeda (Book IV), The Rape of Europa (Book II), and The Death of Actaeon (Book III). Titian's last finished work, The Flaying of Marsyas (c. 1570‚Äì1576), depicts the punishment of the satyr Marsyas (Book VI). * The marble sculpture The Rape of Proserpina (1621‚Äì22) by Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini depicts the abduction of Proserpina by Pluto, ruler of the underworld (treated by Ovid in Book V). In 1625, Bernini finished his sculpture Apollo and Daphne, which depicts the metamorphosis of the nymph Daphne as she flees from Apollo after he was pierced by Cupid's love-inducing arrow (Book I). This episode furthermore has been treated repeatedly in opera, notably by Jacopo Peri (Dafne) in 1597 and Richard Strauss (Daphne, with a libretto that deviates significantly from Ovid's account) in 1938. * Las Hilanderas (\\"The Spinners\\"), a painting from the 1650s by Diego Vel√°zquez housed in the Museo del Prado, is influenced by Ovid's story of Arachne (Book VI). In the Vel√°zquez painting, the tapestry Arachne is weaving is a copy of Titian's The Rape of Europa (ca. 1560-62). * Jupiter and Semele (1894‚Äì95), a painting by the French Symbolist artist Gustave Moreau, depicts the myth of the mortal woman Semele, mother of Bacchus, and her lover, Jupiter (Book III). * The painting Echo and Narcissus (1903), by the English Pre-Raphaelite painter John William Waterhouse, depicts the myth of Echo and Narcissus described in Book III.

A few years ago the members > of a church in Georgia all agreed to plant an acre of cotton for the church. > The Lord's Acres of cotton did well, and brought in a rich harvest to the > church, not only in money but also in enthusiasm and power. ...Farmers > Federation News, March 1927, quoted in We Plow God's Fields: A Biography of > James G.K. McClure, Jr. (Boone, N.C.: Appalachian Consortium Press, 1991), > pp. 349-350. The Lord's Acre Plan was established in 1930, and under the leadership of Dumont Clarke the project grew to include over one thousand churches in twenty different denominations.\\"About the Lord's Acre,\\" Lord's Acres were established throughout the United States, and internationally in India, China, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan.  In popular culture   God's Little Acre  In God's Little Acre, a 1933 novel by Erskine Caldwell, a character named Ty Ty Walden is portrayed as a widower who owns a small farm in South Carolina. Ty Ty is obsessed with finding gold on his land. He has promised to donate any profits generated by 1 acre (4,000 m2) of the farm to the church, but is terrified that gold will be found on \\"God's acre\\", so he keeps moving the acre around. Since God's Little Acre contained scenes of (what was then considered) explicit sexuality, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice took Caldwell and Viking Press to court for disseminating pornography. More than 60 authors, editors, and literary critics rallied in support of the book, and Judge Benjamin Greenspan of the New York Magistrates' Court ruled in its favor. The court case is still considered a major decision in the establishment of artists' First Amendment rights in freedom of expression.\\"Sumner Defeated in Fight on a Book,\\" New York Times, May 24, 1933  News & Media  April 10, 2013: Early County News: Georgia Historical Society Erects Historical Marker at Bluffton Baptist Church http://www.earlycountynews.com/news/2013-04-10/Front_Page/The_Lords_Acre.html  References   External links  * The Lord's Acre historical marker Category:Social movements in the United States Category:1922 establishments in the United States ","title":"Lord's Acre Movement"},{"id":"39119414","text":"Percy Skipworth Duff (1922 ‚Äì 2011) was the treasurer of Kendal Borough Council from 1967, until April 1974 when he became deputy treasurer of the new South Lakeland District Council, holding the position until his retirement in 1982.

Early life Amir Kubura was born in the town of Kakanj in SR of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the SFR Yugoslavia on 4 March 1964. Kubura started his military career as an Officer with the Yugoslav People's Army where he served for five years, reaching the rank of Captain before leaving in 1992 in order to join the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Role in the Yugoslav Wars During the early stages of the Bosnian War Kubura worked for the Chief of Staff of the 7th Muslim Mountain Brigade, 3rd Corps of the Army the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1 January 1993 to 20 July 1993, he was then assigned Acting Commander of the 7th Muslim Mountain Brigade on 1 April 1993, before being made permanent Commander on 6 August 1993. During this period under Kubura's command was a notable amount of Foreign Mujahideen from Islamic Countries fighting for the Bosnian Muslims. From January 1993 to January 1994 in Central Bosnia the Bosnian Army and the Mujahideen engaged in heavy assaults on the Bosnian Croat forces called the Croatian Defence Council, the fighting intensified in the municipalities Kakanj, Travnik and Zenica. The attacks were aimed at primarily at Bosnian Croat towns and villages however Bosnian Serb settlements were also targeted around 200 Croat and Serb civilians were killed and many more were wounded. Croat and Serb property was destroyed and plundered without military justification. Houses, buildings, religious sites, livestock and institutions were damaged or desecrated. In November 1993 Kubura's 7th Muslim Mountain Brigade of the 3rd Corps were involved in an offensive on the Croatian held town of Vare≈°. During Kubura's trial the Prosecution claimed that from 3-4 November 1993 in Vare≈° the 7th Muslim Brigade \\"shattered the shop windows and broke down the doors of all the shops in town in order to get to the booty\\". Ralf Wekesser a former monitor for the European Community Monitoring Mission testified to the ICTY in Kubura's trial that on the 8 November 1993 that the \\"streets were full of people trying to loot and the roads leading from Vares were full of soldiers and civilians loaded with the things they had looted\\", however Kubura stated that he had ordered his 7th Muslim Mountain Brigade to leave Vare≈° on 5 November 1993. Trial and Imprisonment Kubura was first indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on 13 July 2001 before been arrested on 2 August 2001 after he voluntarily gave himself up, he was then transferred to the ICTY two days later on 4 August 2001. On 9 August 2001 Kubura was charged by the ICTY on basis of his 'criminal responsibility as hierarchical superior' per Article 7 paragraph 3 of ICTY Statute for six counts of violations of the laws and customs of war per Article 3 of the ICTY Statute including \\"murder, cruel treatment, wanton destruction of towns and villages not justified by military necessity, plunder of public or private property.\\" Kubura pleaded not guilty to all charges against him the same day. Kubura was given provisional release from 19 December 2001 to 27 November 2003 before his trial officially opened on 2 December 2003. Kubura's defence lawyer Rodney Dixon argued that Kubura was the Chief of Staff and he wasn't officially appointed Commander until 6 August 1993, after the majority of the crimes he was charged with had already been committed. Dixon stated that \\"there is not much we have to answer in the case against Amir Kubura,\\" and that the prosecution's arguments about Kubura's control of the 7th Brigade over the Foreign Mujahideen were \\"based on assumptions.\\" On 15 March 2006 Kubura was acquitted for the majority of charges against him however he was found guilty due to his 'superior criminal responsibility' for \\"failing to take necessary and reasonable measures to punish members of his forces who plundered private or public property in the villages of Susanj, Ovnak, Brajkovici and Grahovcici in June 1993... [and] for failing to prevent or punish members of his forces who plundered private or public property in the village of Vares in November 1993\\" and he was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. The Defence appealed this verdict asking for the verdict to be overturned whilst the Prosecution appealed the sentence requesting that it be increased to five years imprisonment, however the Prosecution's appeal was dismissed by the appeals chamber. Kubura was granted early release on 11 April 2006 due to the 828 days he spent in pre-trial detention. On 22 April 2008 the Appeals Chamber Judges found that Kubura took the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent certain acts of plunder committed by those under his command in Vare≈° in November 1993 and reversed the Trial Chamber‚Äôs charges for this conviction, his sentence was reduced from two and a half years imprisonment to two years imprisonment by the Appeals Chamber; however Kubura had already served his sentence. Personal life Kubura was given provisional release from detention from 13 March 2004 to 15 March 2004 for him to attend the funeral of his mother.

History The lighthouse was constructed in the 1870s and was completed in 1882, on Sweden's initiative. Of steel construction, it was erected on a three-metre granite plinth. The red-painted lighthouse had seven floors. The lighthouse had a crew of nine, of which half were occupying the lighthouse at a time. The lighthouse was damaged in a storm during the winter of 1889. In an 1894 repair, it was strengthened and to add weight, the space between its inner and outer shells was filled in with concrete up to the third floor. In 1905, a wireless telegraph was installed, replacing the previous communication via light signals to passing ships. In the First World War, a German warship destroyed the original lighthouse. A new automated lighthouse was constructed in 1922 on concrete pillars. The lighthouse was restored in 1981, when it was equipped with a helipad. The lighthouse is now painted blue-white and is solar-powered.

The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616 refers to the first of several large schutterstukken painted by Frans Hals for the St. George (or St. Joris) civic guard of Haarlem, and today is considered one of the main attractions of the Frans Hals Museum there. Influenced by Cornelis van Haarlem The same militia company in 1599, by Cornelis van Haarlem Hals was in his thirties when he painted this piece, and was far from established as a portrait painter. To be safe, he based most of his design on the painting of his predecessor, Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem, who painted the same militia company in 1599. Given a nearly impossible task, namely to complete his assignment but to add theatrical elements at the same time, Hals must have spent much time judging the politics of the group. He knew these men well as he served in the St. Joris militia himself from 1612‚Äì1615. In his painting, he indicates the political position of each man in the group as well as managing to give each a characteristic portrait. In Cornelis van Haarlem's piece the figures seem crammed into a tight space, and each face seems to have a similar expression. In Hals' group, an illusion of space and relaxed conversation is given. Officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the orange sash heads the table and the second in command is on his right. The three ensigns stand and the servant is carrying a plate. Large painting on canvas The entire painting is on one piece of seamless linen 175 √ó 324 cm, and a full meter wider than its predecessor by Cornelis van Haarlem, which was painted on oak panels. An impression of space and depth is given by diagonal lines leading the viewer to gaze beyond the flag out the window. The men featured are from left to right Provost Johan van Napels, Colonel Hendrick van Berckenrode (wearing the orange sash), Captain Jacob Laurensz, Ensign Jacob Cornelisz Schout (holding the flag), Captain Vechter Jansz van Teffelen, Lieutenant Cornelis Jacobsz Schout, Lieutenant Hugo Mattheusz Steyn, a servant (standing in the back), Ensign Gerrit Cornelisz Vlasman, and Ensign Boudewijn van Offenberg. In the foreground seated in front of the table are Captain Nicolaes Woutersz van der Meer, and Lieutenant Pieter Adriaensz Verbeek. Besides portraying the men and the group dynamics, this painting shows off the Haarlem damast tablecloth, brocade pillows on the chairs and the halberds hanging on the wall. It also displays Hals' talents as a painter: Portraiture, Still life, and Landscape. St. Jorisdoelen View of the main buildings of the St. Jorisdoelen; on the left is the north building from 1592, and on the right is the old gate in Lieven de Key style seen from the back. A reproduction of this schutterstuk in the garden of the old \\"St. Joris Doelen\\", today the Proveniershof, Haarlem. The church tower in the distance is the Nieuwe Kerk, Haarlem. The painting may have been painted on location, as Frans Hals lived in the Peuzelaarsteeg very close to the St. George militia headquarters (St. Jorisdoelen) who commissioned the painting, and managing a canvas of this size would have been a problem in Hals' studio. As an official art restorer employed by the city council, Hals had probably also already worked on paintings there. The premises had previously been the location of the women's convent call the St. Michielsklooster and after the old hall was refurbished in 1577 to house the St. Joris militia, a new hall in renaissance style was built at the north end in 1592.report on Rijksmonument number 19243 The paintings by Hals and Cornelis van Haarlem hung in the renaissance building at the corner of the Grote Houtstraat. Today a restaurant, the windows overlook the garden of the Proveniershuis, but in the 17th century this was an area used for target practise. Legacy Engraving of the \\"Heren Logement\\" in border of 1688 map by De Hooge, seen from the Grote Houtstraat. Hals' painting was a huge success, as he won several additional portrait commissions from the subjects and their relatives, as well as winning the commission to paint a group portrait of this militia again in 1627 and in 1639. In later years the painting was seen by visitors to Haarlem, as it remained hanging in its original building after it became an inn. The inn is featured on Romeyn de Hooghe's map of Haarlem in 1688, showing the gate with a statue of St. George slaying the dragon as silent witness to the building's earlier purpose. The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616 appears on the restaurant wall in the 1989 Peter Greenaway film The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover.

Largely created from the staff of the National Imagery Exploitation Centre (formally known as the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC)) and then known for several years as the Defence Geospatial Intelligence Fusion Centre, it can trace its history back to clandestine reconnaissance operations at the beginning of the Second World War by Sydney Cotton on behalf of MI6 and then MI4, and the formation of the Allied Central Interpretation Unit at RAF Medmenham (sister to Bletchley Park). Today, DIFC's role has grown beyond just imagery intelligence. Part of the Joint Forces Intelligence Group (JFIG) within Defence Intelligence, DIFC's primary role is to support Defence planning, current operations and the intelligence assessment process. DIFC still provides specialist imagery intelligence, but also conducts multi-disciplinary intelligence fusion for the armed forces and other UK Government partners. The integrated multi- disciplinary Task Groups at DIFC use data and reporting from various sources (including satellite imagery), together with other advanced technologies, to provide critical information and over-watch to tactical, operational and strategic decision makers. DIFC is a joint service and civilian organisation under the command of an RAF Group Captain. History Following a series of successful covert air reconnaissance operations run by the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) prior to World War II, the Photographic Development Unit (PDU) was established on 19 January 1940 (codenamed MI4) and later renamed Photographic Interpretation Unit (PIU) on 11 July 1940. Through a series of War Ministry reorganisations the PIU was renamed the Central Interpretation Unit (CIU) on 7 January 1941 and changed again to the Joint Air Photographic Intelligence centre (UK) JAPIC [UK] in August 1947. On 17 December 1953 the unit was given the name of Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre [UK] - JARIC [UK]. The JARIC Photographic Wing moved to Brampton near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire from locations at Medmenham, Nuneham Park, Wyton and Wembley in 1956 where they were joined by the Joint School of Photographic Interpretation (JSPI) in December. In 1980 the (UK) was dropped from the name to reflect the closing of the Cyprus-based JARIC (ME), later JARIC (NE) in April 1975. On 19 April 1996 the unit ceased to fall under operational control of the Royal Air Force and became an agency under the operational control of the Director General Intelligence and Geographic Requirements, taking a more centralised government role within the Ministry of Defence. On 1 April 2000 the unit stopped functioning as an independent agency and merged with Military Survey into the Defence Geographic and Imagery Intelligence Agency (DGIA). On 10 October 2005 the JARIC name ceased to be an acronym to reflect the fact that its sources of imagery had shifted away from those provided by UK Air Reconnaissance platforms to be predominantly satellite imagery based. The descriptor ‚ÄòThe National Imagery Exploitation Centre‚Äô was added to the JARIC title to better explain JARIC's role, not just within the Ministry of Defence but within the wider UK intelligence community. On 10 June 2006, DGI (as it became after agency status was removed) was renamed the Intelligence Collection Group (ICG) and, after moving under the Joint Forces Command (JFC) on 1 April 2012, was renamed to Joint Forces Intelligence Group (JFIG) which consisted of the Defence Geographic Centre (DGC) based at Feltham, Middlesex, the Joint Signals Support Organisation (JSSO), based at RAF Digby, the Joint Aeronautical and Geographic Organisation (JAGO) at Hermitage and RAF Northolt and JARIC-The National Imagery Exploitation Centre based at RAF Brampton. On 13 July 2012, after the formal retiring of the title JARIC, the unit was renamed the Defence Geospatial Intelligence Fusion Centre (DGIFC). Model of Carbonite-2 The Joint Forces Intelligence Group (JFIG) achieved Full Operating Capability in 2014, the culmination of the PRIDE (Wyton) Programme. The commander of JFIG said at the ceremony on 17 September 2014: In 2017-18 the MOD invested ¬£4.5 million in a programme to deliver high-quality imagery and 3D video footage from space, with the Surrey Satellite Technology Carbonite-2 satellite being the first technology demonstrator. Carbonite-2 uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and has a mass of about 100 kg, and was launched on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle PSLV-C40 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in India on 12 January 2018. Data from Carbonite-2 is processed by the centre's Geospatial Intelligence staff. This programme is part of the RAF's vision of a future constellation of imagery satellites. Relocation to Pathfinder Building at RAF Wyton (PRIDE Programme) Pathfinder Building, RAF Wyton In 2013, DGIFC relocated from RAF Brampton to the Pathfinder Building at RAF Wyton creating a multi-intelligence, open plan environment aimed at improving collaboration and innovation changing its name to DIFC on 17 Sept 2014. DGIFC moved to RAF Wyton as part of the Programme to Rationalise and Integrate the Defence Intelligence Estate (PRIDE), which enabled Defence Intelligence, and the Joint Forces Intelligence Group in particular, to further improve and enhance support to operations and strategic threat assessments. The programme relocated the Joint Forces Intelligence Collection Group (JFIG -HQ) from Feltham, DGIFC - from RAF Brampton, as well as 42 Engineer Regiment (Geographic) from Denison Barracks in Hermitage and Ayrshire Barracks in Germany, to RAF Wyton in Cambridgeshire. Areas of expertise DIFC's role has evolved from the more traditional photographic analysis to encompass more technical intelligence disciplines such as: IMINT (IMagery INTelligence) IMINT is an intelligence gathering discipline which collects information via satellite and aerial photography. DGIFC is involved in all aspects of imagery analysis from basic activity reporting to advanced scientific-based MASINT analysis. MASINT (Measurement And Signatures INTelligence) MASINT is scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter or sender, to facilitate the latter's measurement and identification. DIFC is the UK's only provider of ‚Äòimagery derived MASINT‚Äô otherwise known as AGI or Advanced Geospatial Intelligence. GEOINT (GEOspatial INTelligence) GEOINT is an intelligence discipline comprising the exploitation and analysis of geographically determined information. GEOINT sources include imagery and mapping data, whether collected by commercial or military satellites, or by other capabilities such as UAV (Unmanned Airborne Vehicle) or reconnaissance aircraft.

Umwelt, 6, December/January, 25-28.b In 1972, W.F.E. Preiser stated: ‚ÄúWhat is of special interest to environmental psychologists are the rules by which person- environment relationships are determined and adjustments to changing environmental conditions are enabled within cultural realms. Designers of environments, in particular architects and city planners, need measurements on how the variables they have manipulated affect users.‚Äù Early concepts revolved around the psychosocial roles of public and private space, interpersonal conflict, quality of living, and noise pollution. Later concepts explore the relationship between built environments and climate change. Beginnings of architectural psychology within the German-speaking world One of the first comprehensive overviews of work in environmental psychology is Lenelis Kruse- Graumann‚Äôs dissertation (1974), which was supervised by Carl-Friedrich Graumann.Kruse, L. (1974). R√§umliche Umwelt. Die Ph√§nomenologie des r√§umlichen Verhaltens als Beitrag zu einer psychologischen Umwelttheorie. Berlin: de Gruyter. Around the same time, Ernst-Dieter Lantermann published his dissertation ' [\\"Solidarity and Living\\"].Lantermann, E.-D. (1974). Solidarit√§t und Wohnen. Darmstadt: Steinkopff. Pioneering insights were also generated by seminars in which psychologists and architects worked together and provided impulses for further research. In 1986, architects Peter Jockusch and Lenelis Kruse-Graumann taught together at the University of Kassel. In 1985, 1986 and 1987, continued education seminars were held at the University of T√ºbingen entitled \\"Living in built environments. Psychological aspects of architectural design.\\" These seminars were led by Gerhard Kaminski and his departmental colleagues as well as the architect Klaus Brendle. As early as 1970, Kaminski received an invitation to cooperate with architects of the ' (SFB) 63 (Research Area 63), the research area for higher education buildings at the University of Stuttgart. In 1974, Kaminski worked with architects from SFB 64 on plane load-bearing structures and the fundamentals of design.Kaminski, G. (1975). Psychologie und Bauen - Einf√ºhrung in den Problemkreis aus der Sicht des Psychologen. In J. Joedicke (Hrsg.), Architekturpsychologische Forschung. Psychologie und Bauen (S. 6-30). Stuttgart: Kr√§mer. These early projects contributed to the establishment of environmental psychology in Germany. Environmental psychology‚Äôs position among neighboring disciplines Carl- Friedrich Graumann of the University of Heidelberg started a DFG (') program entitled \\"Psychological Ecology\\", which led to a \\"city-psychological\\" project. Gerhard Kaminski and Lenelis Kruse-Graumann, by founding a disciplinary group for Environmental Psychology within the German Society for Psychology (') in 1994, achieved a disciplinary space for ecological psychology (and, therewith, also for architectural psychology) within academia. Researcher Rotraut Walden has conducted international academic research in the field as an active participant in symposia for International Building Performance Evaluation (IBPE) and at congresses hosted by the Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA) and the International Association of People-Environment Studies (IAPS). Her book Schools for the Future (2009) features contributions by members of the EDRA.Walden, R. (Ed.) (2009). Schools for the Future. Design proposals from Architectural Psychology.

The concepts of ‚Äòprivate space‚Äô and ‚Äòneighborhoods‚Äô One of the first professorial dissertations (') dealing with architectural psychology by Lenelis Kruse-Graumann was published in 1980.Kruse, L. (1980). Privatheit als Problem und Gegenstand der Psychologie. Bern: Huber. Volker Linneweber completed a professorial dissertation in 1991 entitled \\"'\\" [\\"Interpersonal conflicts in daily life. Disputes between neighbors ‚Äì disturbances and adverse effects within private living spaces\\"]. In it, ‚Äòliving‚Äô is defined as both an individual and interpersonal occurrence and involves concepts of design and use of private space as well as socio-psychological processes: normative expectations, demands, hopes, social influences and conflicts.Linneweber, V.

The handbook ' [\\"Ecological Psychology\\"] published by Lenelis Kruse-Graumann, Carl-Friedrich Graumann and Ernst-Dieter Lantermann in 1990 and 1996 covers, among other things, several topics related to architectural psychology that helped establish the discipline.Kruse, L., Graumann, C.-F. & Lantermann, E.D. (1996). √ñkologische Psychologie. Zur Einf√ºhrung. In L. Kruse, C.-F. Graumann & E.-D. Lantermann (Hrsg.), √ñkologische Psychologie (S. 1-13). M√ºnchen: Psychologie Verlags Union. It deals, for example, with the concepts of ‚Äòappropriation‚Äô (Graumann), ‚Äòbehavior-setting analysis‚Äô (Kaminski), ‚Äòperson-environment congruence‚Äô (Fuhrer) and ‚Äòcontrol and loss of control‚Äô (Fischer and Stephan). Additional subjects include ‚Äòchildren and environment‚Äô (Flade), ‚Äòschool learning environments‚Äô (Linneweber), ‚Äòmuseums‚Äô (Klein), ‚Äòworking environments‚Äô (Schmale), ‚Äòoffice environments‚Äô (Schaible-Rapp), ‚Äòtherapeutic environments‚Äô (Welter), ‚Äòthe sick and disabled‚Äô (Day) and ‚Äònursing homes‚Äô (Saup). In 1993, Winfried Saup published a comprehensive work on aging and environment.Saup, W. (1993). Alter und Umwelt. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer. Dieckmann, Flade, Schuemer, Str√∂hlein and Walden popularized many architecture-psychological studies in Germany by citing them in the book ' [\\"Psychology and built environments\\"] (1998).Dieckmann, F., Flade, A., Schuemer, R., Str√∂hlein, G. & Walden, R. (1998). Psychologie und gebaute Umwelt. Konzepte, Methoden, Anwendungsbeispiele. Darmstadt: Institut Wohnen und Umwelt. They also describe basic theoretical principles and methods that have provided German researchers with a knowledge base and framework for further research. J√ºrgen Hellbr√ºck and Manfred Fischer brought together many architecture-psychological topics in their comprehensive book ' [\\"Environmental psychology\\"] (1999).Hellbr√ºck, J. & Fischer, M. (1999). Umweltpsychologie. Ein Lehrbuch. G√∂ttingen: Hogrefe. It describes psychic-material and spatial-social environments, living, surroundings and cities. Noise, sound pollution and contributions on acoustics In 1999 August Schick, Maria Klatte and Markus Meis presented conclusions on research related to classroom acoustics, which have been significant for the construction of schools.Schick, A., Klatte, M. & Meis, M. (1999). Die L√§rmbelastung von Lehrern und Sch√ºlern - ein Forschungsstandsbericht. Z. f√ºr L√§rmbek√§mpfung, 46, 77-87. Hearing and noise researcher Schick led nine symposia on the psychology of acoustics at the University of Oldenburg in which he brought together scholars from different fields to form an interdisciplinary research group that is still working productively in Oldenburg to this day.Schick, A. et al. (1981-2003). Contributions to Psychological Acoustics II-IX. Results of the Oldenburg Symposia on Psychological Acoustics. Oldenburg (all symposia on CD ROM). While their research has not necessarily received wide reception within the field of environmental psychology, it is of significance to the international community of psycho-acoustic researchers, such as those affiliated with the Inter-Noise conference, the International Congress on Noise Control Engineering, and the German Society for Acoustics. August Schick helped found all of these organizations. For twenty years (1985-2005), Schick and Rainer Guski were involved in the research group ' [Interdisciplinary sound effect research] at the Federal Environmental Agency in Berlin. Rainer Guski has been devoted to the protection of resident populations from street and air-traffic noise since the 1970s.Guski, R. (1987). L√§rm. Wirkungen unerw√ºnschter Ger√§usche. Bern: Huber.Guski, R. (2004). How to forecast community annoyance in planning noisy facilities? Noise & Health, 6, 59 -64. His work establishes the connection between outdoor noise and noise pollution, and he consults politicians on setting noise-level limits for communities. Current research on office acoustics is being conducted by Sabine Schlittmeier and J√ºrgen Hellbr√ºck at the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt.Schlittmeier, S. J., Hellbr√ºck, J., Thaden, R. & Vorl√§nder, M. (forthcoming). The impact of background speech varying in intelligibility: Effects on cognitive performance and perceived disturbance. Ergonomics. The effects of acoustics on work performance and feeling of well-being as well as different methods for controlling acoustics are of particular interest to architects, building and room acousticians and interior architects and designers. Current efforts in environmental psychology ‚Äì and their relationship to climate protection Environmental psychology in Germany today has turned predominantly toward the climate ‚Äì toward climate research, prevention of catastrophe, research related to environmental systems, sustainability and reduction of waste. Nevertheless, ' [Psychology in the environment] devoted a special-edition publication to the topic of architectural psychology in 2003.Zeitschrift IPUblic (Initiative Psychologie im Umweltschutz e.V.). (12/2003), Nr. 6, 2. Pabst Science Publishers regularly publishes a magazine called Environmental Psychology, devoted, though not exclusively, to the theme of its title; two editions, however, dealt with \\"Public Spaces\\" (2003)Zeitschrift Umweltpsychologie (2003). √ñffentliche R√§ume [Public Spaces], hg. von N. Moczek & R. Rambow (Sonderheft), 7(1). and \\"City Psychology\\" (2006).Zeitschrift Umweltpsychologie (2006). Stadtpsychologie [Urban psychology], hg. von H.A. Mieg & C. Hoffmann. (Sonderheft), 10(2). The bridge between climate protection and architectural psychology Volker Linneweber of the University of Saarbr√ºcken and Ernst- Dieter Lantermann of the University of Kassel are publishing a forthcoming encyclopedia entitled ' [\\"Specific environments and environmentally related behavior\\"], in which both behaviors related to climate protection (addressed by Florian Kaiser and Petra Schweizer-Ries), environmental risks and the latest German architecture-psychological environment-behavior research are included.Linneweber, V.; Lantermann, E.D & Kals, E.

N. Birbaumer et al.). G√∂ttingen: Hogrefe. The volume also incorporates authors such as Rainer Guski, J√ºrgen Hellbr√ºck and August Schick Raum on acoustics and noise as well as human behavior and experience. Urs Fuhrer summarizes information related to children and teens under the heading ' [\\"Environments and their users\\"]. Claudi Quaiser-Pohl addresses ' [\\"special fields of operation\\"] within the rubric ' [\\"Playing and learning\\"]. Riklef Rambow describes the relationship between architecture and psychology, while Hans-Joachim Harloff deals with city planning. New publications specific to architectural psychology Riklef Rambow combined methods from architectural psychology, expert research and the psychology of communication in his 2000 dissertation, to develop a model for mediating architecture to laypeople.Rambow, R. (2000). Experten-Laien-Kommunikation in der Architektur. M√ºnster: Waxmann. He has since applied this model to the training of architects and city planners and has contributed a psychology perspective to contemporary debates surrounding the promotion of a building culture in Germany and Austria (Rambow 2007).Rambow, R. (2007). Kommunikation von PlanerInnen. In ARGE Baukulturreport (Hrsg.), √ñsterreichischer Baukulturreport 2006, Heft 3: Baukultur: √ñffentlichkeit (S. 68-71). Wien: ARGE Baukulturreport. An additional book entitled ' [\\"Architectural psychology\\"] published by Peter G. Richter in Dresden in 2004 is marketed as an instructional book and features several different authors, theoretical approaches and empirical studies.Richter, P.G. (Hrsg.) (2004). Architekturpsychologie. Eine Einf√ºhrung. Lengerich: Pabst Science Publishers. Psychological concepts for evaluation of schools, universities and offices In her professorial dissertation, Rotraut Walden focuses architecture- psychological research on ‚Äúperformance,‚Äù ‚Äúwell-being‚Äù and ‚Äúcontrol over one‚Äôs environment‚Äù in relation to schools, higher education institutions and office buildings ‚Äì namely, the Waldorf School in Cologne built by Peter H√ºbner of Neckartenzlingen, the campus of the University of Koblenz built by the architecture firm Ackermann, D√ºck and Schneider of Speyer and the post office tower in Bonn built by Murphy/Jahn of Chicago among many others.Walden, Rotraut (2008). Architekturpsychologie: Schule, Hochschule und B√ºrogeb√§ude der Zukunft. Lengerich: Pabst Science Publishers. Walden‚Äôs research advanced an interdisciplinary approach that drew from pedagogical psychology as well as social and organizational psychology. Points addressed within the publication include: * The development of the Koblenz Architectural Survey: This questionnaire contributes to approaches on Building Performance Evaluation by linking built environments with human reactions to these environments and isolating this link for further evaluation. Six criteria draw from established benchmarks for evaluating buildings according to major types of and trends in architecture: functional architecture, architecture highly influences by aesthetic principles, social-psychical modes of building (which limit social conflicts via layout), ecological concepts, and buildings that achieve organizational requirements within specific budgets. These criteria have never been applied to psychological research. The Koblenz Architectural Survey was developed to flexibly adjust to each object of research to which it is applied. * Measurement of a building‚Äôs orientation toward the future: Collected data is analyzed via t-tests, correlations and regression analyses to understand how specific design elements influence the criteria of performance, well-being, and control over one‚Äôs environment. The survey is structured to yield comparisons between actual conditions and desired improvements for the future. A guiding question is whether individual design elements meet the criteria for contributing to a so-called ‚Äòbuilding of the future.‚Äô Buildings are evaluated according to innovative, future-oriented characteristics, which allows this method to adapt to different points in time and with each advance in building design and conceptualization. * Impact on planning and construction of architectural psychology: The results of Walden‚Äôs approach are directly applicable to builders and architects‚Äô projects. The approach is not only intended to yield academic insights but also to be of practical relevance.

Following the 2009 short, Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space, the short follows the monster team taking on a mutated carrot army that can mind control others. Dr. Cockroach determines that the only way to defeat them and free their victims is for B.O.B. to eat all of the carrots. The short originally premiered in two parts exclusively on the Nintendo Video video service for the Nintendo 3DS system; the first was released on October 13, 2011, and the second five days later. It eventually received a general release on August 28, 2012 as part of the Shrek's Thrilling Tales DVD and DreamWorks Spooky Stories Blu-ray. Plot In a theater, B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) introduces the story in a manner parodying typical horror films, with a recap of the events of \\"Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space\\", and tells the audience to be prepared for a story guaranteed to give them nightmares. The scene then shifts to the twist ending of the previous special. The Zombie Carrot charges at the camera, but is stopped by a gate slamming into it. Ginormica‚Äôs father, Carl (Jeffrey Tambor) announces to the children of the Modesto suburbs that a costume contest was starting and the winner would get their weight in candy. B.O.B., dressed as a pirate, takes all the candy. Outside, he's frightened by the zombie carrot, but mistakes it for a child in a costume. Believing the carrot would win the costume contest, he throws it inside where it immediately bites Carl, turning him into a zombie. The guests flee the Murphy house and the carrot is blasted by Dr. Cockroach's (James Horan) scanner. Carl snaps out of his zombie state and Doc theorizes that the carrot was contaminated by the mutant pumpkins and the curse could only be lifted by eliminating the infected carrot. However, the remains of the carrot replicate themselves into more zombie carrots, reinfecting Carl. Against Cockroach's advice, B.O.B. uses the scanner to blast the carrots and before long, B.O.B., Cockroach and the Missing Link (David Kaye) are completely surrounded. General Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) arrives but he falls victim to the zombie carrots. Cockroach, Link and B.O.B. retreat inside the house to create a barricade. B.O.B.'s bungling leads to Link getting infected and both Cockroach and B.O.B. retreat to Ginormica's old room, where a stray zombie carrot seemingly infects B.O.B.; this appears to have no effect however and Cockroach realizes that B.O.B. is immune because he has no brain. Cockroach then tells B.O.B. that the only way to save the day is that he must eat all the carrots. This causes B.O.B. to have a flashback revealing why he has a fear of carrots; when he was young, he was force-fed carrot puree by General Monger. B.O.B. is unwilling to eat the carrots and escapes through the window to the roof, but when he sees his zombified friends, he decides to eat the zombie carrots. B.O.B. eats every zombie carrot, rendering him obese. He is about to eat a \\"Nutty Buddy Butter Bar\\" for dessert when he sees his friends are still zombies. The original zombie carrot appears and B.O.B. is unable to pursue due to his weight. The carrot opens the bar, causing B.O.B. to chase it down and eat it whole as a chocolate-covered carrot. Link, Monger and Cockroach snap out of their zombie- like states and hug B.O.B. causing him to burp out an orange cloud. Back in the theater, B.O.B. reminds us to eat our vegetables, or ‚Äúthey just might eat you\\", but his shadow morphs into a zombie carrot as he leaves.

Background  On 8 October, the rebels launched an offensive to capture the town of Maarrat al-Nu'man, which holds a strategic position next to the M5 Highway, a key route which government reinforcements from Damascus would need to use in order to enter the battle in Aleppo. By 10 October, rebels were in control of the city and three days later repulsed a convoy of Army reinforcements that were being sent in an attempt to recapture the town. However, two military bases on the outskirts of Maarrat al-Nu'man remained under Army control and the rebels soon imposed a siege with continuous attacks in a bid to capture them. The Wadi Deif base was protected by two large outposts: Zahlani, which was just 600 to 700 meters from rebel positions, and Hamidiyah, which also came under a heavier attack by rebels. The two rebel launch points were Maarat al-Numaan and Marshamsheh. In addition to its imposing position near a strategic spot along the south-north Damascus- Aleppo highway, Wadi Deif was also an important barracks with an armored regiment and a fuel depot believed to hold millions of liters in underground silos. There were at least four other smaller checkpoints protecting it, beside Zahlani and Hamidiyah. The rebels were spread out along a 5-km southern front in Maarat al-Numaan, working to take out the Hamidiyah checkpoint. Each position was 100 m from the other. There were seven men per post. The nearest military location was only 400 meters away in some places, 700 in others.  Siege  First rebel attacks On 11 October, an AFP reporter said that the rebels were in control of five kilometers of highway running from the town. On the same day, the FSA launched an attack on the Wadi Deif siege, which was being used to shell Maarrat al-Nu'man, just east of the town near the highway. Rebels used at least one captured tank, RPGs and mortar bombs, as the town continued to be hit by airstrikes. On 14 October, government troops made attempts to block a new rebel attack on the military base with fighting raging in the nearby villages of Maarshurin and Hish. The next day, rebels pushed the military back from the town to two barracks on its outskirts. Rebel commanders called it \\"a major breakthrough\\". Army reinforcements sent On 15 October, a column of reinforcements was sent to make an attempt to break through to the base. On 16 October, the military counter-attack continued with additional air-strikes on the town and surrounding areas. The next day, a military attack helicopter was shot down during fighting in Maarhtat, on the outskirts of Maarrat al-Nu'man. On 18 October, military fighter jets destroyed two residential buildings and a mosque, where many women and children, who had thought the danger had passed and returned to the town, were taking refuge. Rescue workers said the airstrikes had killed at least 44 people. 23 children were among those killed in the airstrike, including a nine-month-old baby, according to the workers. In the evening, the rebels launched what they said was a \\"final assault\\" on the Wadi Daif military base. The rebels claimed to have destroyed three tanks and captured six soldiers in the fighting. Hundreds of rebels were involved in the operation, according to an AFP correspondent. The rebels captured the fertiliser storage area, which is part of the military complex, and killed six soldiers, according to SOHR. On 19 October, rebels announced they had removed part of a collection of mosaics from the city's museum in order to protect it from ongoing bombardment. The collection was reported to have suffered little looting, though a pre-Islamic era coin collection has gone missing. On 8 October a government jet dropped a bomb close to the building's entrance, shattering its doors and damaging some of the more fragile pieces. By 20 October, rebels had encircled Wadi Deif on three sides. The base was defended with at least 15 tanks and 250-500 troops. Soldiers inside the base were relying on airdrops for resupply, however most were missing and falling into rebel areas or no man's land. Meanwhile, Army reinforcements had advanced to five kilometers south of Maarrat al-Nu'man, but were still being held back by rebel forces. On 21 October, four tanks were destroyed as the reinforcement column tried to reach the base. On 23 October, government air-strikes on Maarrat al-Nu'man and the village of Mar Shamsheh killed and wounded more than two dozen rebels. By this point, the battle for the Wadi Deif base had been going on for two weeks. The fall of the base would result in government forces having only one land route to resupply their forces in Aleppo, via the port of Lattakia. Government control of the base meant the rebels could not claim full control of Maarrat al-Nu'man. The military was using airdrops to resupply the soldiers at the base with bread and other food. Government forces had also been using continuous attacks along the M5 highway to link up with the besieged soldiers based in Wadi Daif. The base itself is believed to hold 5 million liters of kerosene according to a defected army officer. By taking the base, the FSA would also be able to protect their flank and then advance on Jisr al-Shughour and block supply and reinforcement convoys coming in from Latakia for Aleppo. On 25 October, despite rebel attempts to stop their advance, the military armored column, sent to reinforce the base 10 days before, had arrived near Maarrat al-Nu'man. They deployed south of the town and started shelling rebel forces that were attacking Wadi Daif, thus curbing the two-week-old rebel siege of the military base. On 26 October, at 10:30am (local time), rebels, including the Islamist Al-Nusra Front, attacked government positions near the Wadi Dief base sparking 'fierce clashes' between the two sides. The Army responded by shelling Deir Sharqi, a nearby village. It is considered to be the first violation of the attempted ceasefire for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Right. The Al-Nusra Front had earlier warned that, although not the only group to do so, there was \\"no truce between us and this transgressing regime\\".http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking- news/islamist-group-rejects-syria-truce-site/story-e6frf7k6-1226502778622 Islamist group rejects Syria truce: SITE 25 October 2012 According to SOHR, rebels shelled a building in the Waif Dief complex, completely destroying it and killing 9-10 soldiers. SOHR also reported four rebels were killed at the perimeter of the base during the fighting. On 27 October, in spite of the truce, government forces were moving convoys full of reinforcements up the road to Wadi Deif. FSA fighters were struggling to stop their advance. Army secures the highway On 30 October, rebels clashed with Syrian Army troops south of the city, killing two soldiers and two members of Al-Nusra Front. Also, the military shelled the nearby village of Maarshmareen. Rebel fighters and Syrian Army forces fought new gun battles around the besieged Wadi Deif army base. 28 civilians were killed by government bombings of the city. Rebel fighters had largely left the town itself for the front lines outside of it. On 31 October and 1 November, air-strikes on the city intensified as clashes just south of Maarrat al-Nu'man continued. The siege of Wadi Deif continued with FSA units, backed by the Al-Nusra Front, trying to capture the base. By early November, rebels were beginning to fear that they might have to withdraw from the city. Insufficient coordination, supplies, and firepower combined with the intense army pressure and counter-attacks from air and ground make holding the city a \\"costly\\" for them. Rebels have also had to use their own monthly wages (US$150) to buy ammunition. Despite the continuous siege of Wadi Deif, the army has kept the base supplied on a regular basis. By 10 November, after 10 days of fighting, Syrian forces gradually recaptured villages along the highway that leads to Maarrat al-Nu'man. These villages fell to the rebels in early October. Combined with the recent resupply of food and ammunition to the besieged Wadi Deif base, fighting intensified between the two sides. Although government forces had not yet entered the town of Maarrat al-Nu'man and the siege of the Wadi Deif continued, pressure increased on rebel forces in the area. On 14 November, Syrian forces launched two air strikes on Maaret al-Numan while continuing their attempt to retake the town from the rebels, a battle which has been ongoing since 9 October. Continued fighting On 19 November, rebels and loyalist soldiers clashed south of Maarrat al-Nu'man on the highway and nearby villages. Rebels still controlled the city and the highway entrance to the town. Rebels destroyed two tanks and shot down one helicopter. Rebel fighters also made another advance onto the Wadi Deif army base, where heavy fighting erupted. On 22 November, rebels claimed to have destroyed two government tanks near the Hamidieh army base. By 26 November, the vast majority of the city's 150,000 original inhabitants had fled. Much of the city lay in ruins; government media labelled the destruction as the result of a magnitude 6.6 earthquake, but residents maintained that unrelenting shelling of the rebel-controlled city by the military was the actual cause. The stretch of highway running south of the city to Damascus was reportedly under government control, while the stretch running north to Aleppo was not under the firm control of either side. The parallel military highway remained open, but was characterised as a very slow and inefficient supply line due to the roughness of the road. On 28 November, several rebel brigades launched a fresh assault against the base at Wadi Deif.Syria rebels assault Idlib base as fighting rages Clashes in the southern part of Ma'arat al-Nu'man killed four soldiers and one rebel.https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe/posts/303499813091697 SHOR 28 November 2012 December and January rebel assaults FSA fighters launched another attack on the base on 25 December, in what was described as the heaviest fighting in months in the area. The attack was commenced by a car bomb and than mortars. 20 rebels, including a \\"commander\\" were killed in the fighting. By 29 December, the renewed rebel offensive against the Wadi Deif base was faltering due to a lack of supplies. Following the failed December offensive, questions were being raised who was responsible for the rebel failure to capture Wadi Deif. The main cause was pointed to be the divisions among different rebel groups, a lack of coherence in their joint operations due to competition for loot, uneven funding and, according to one report, firebrand clerics who lack an understanding of battle field realities. In January, more coordinated and planned rebel assaults were launched against the bases, however they too were repulsed with at least another 26 rebels being killed. Siege continues On 7 February, Time Magazine reported that a council of clerics, led by Jahbat al-Nusra, was marshaling supplies and organizing multiple rebel groups around Maarat al-Nu'man, including Suqour al- Sham and the FSA's Idlib Revolutionary Military Council, for a new offensive against the besieged Wadi Deif base. The large government base of Wadi Deif houses an armored regiment and the rebels believe it also holds millions of liters of fuel in underground silos. On 10 February, intermittent clashes took place between government forces and fighters from several rebel battalions around Wadi al-Dayf and the Hamidiya army base. Areas in Ma'arat al-N'uman city and the Kafruma town were bombarded. On 11 February, it was reported that armed fighters‚Äîallegedly from Jabhat al-Nusra‚Äîshot at and beheaded a statue of the blind poet and philosopher Al-Ma øarri, who was born in the city during the Abbasid era. Al-Ma øarri was known for his criticisms of religion, including Islam. Situation in Ma'arrat al-Nu'man mid-March 2013 On 7 March, a Syrian fighter-jet was downed by anti-aircraft machine-guns while it was bombarding the town of Heish and its surrounding area, in southern Reef Idlib, south of Ma'arat al-Nu'man city. A SOHR activist witnessed the plane falling after it was hit, with black smoke coming out of it. Eyewitnesses reportedly saw the pilots parachuting out of the plane. Siege broken On 13 April, the Syrian Army launched an offensive to resupply the Wadi Deif base, inflicting losses on the rebels. They ambushed the rebels near the village of Babulin. At least 21 rebels were killed and others were wounded in the attack. On 14 April, the rebel siege of the bases had been broken with government troops securing two strategic hilltops, on both sides of the highway, between which half a dozen supply trucks passed to reach the bases. The number of rebel fighters dead or missing in the Army offensive had risen to 50. On 15 April, rebels attempted a counter-attack, although their front was reported to have been weakened in previous weeks due to infighting and the deployment of forces to other battles. Clashes continued into the night at the village of Babulin as rebels made attempts to stop the Army from consolidating their gains. An opposition activist claimed that shouts of people from Babulin were heard on a wireless communication device, calling for rebel fighters to help them, after government forces took control over the town. Rebel fatalities in the two-day government offensive had reportedly reached 100‚Äì107. SOHR claimed that if the government is able to hold this gain, they could reopen the whole road to Aleppo and it would have major strategical implication. Rebels attempted a counterattack on 15 April, but their front was weakened due to infighting and deployment of fighters elsewhere. Rebel fighters claimed that government soldiers disguised themselves as rebels before ambushing opposition fighters. Such disguises included changing their uniforms for civilian clothes used by rebels and wearing religious headbands with sayings such as ‚ÄúThere is no God but God‚Äù. On 16 April, rebels managed to recapture the village of al-Tah, pushing back Army troops to Babulin. However, the rebel forces were still not able to re-establish the blockade of the military bases and neither side had full control of the highway. On 18 April, rebel forces made a fresh attempt to recapture Babulin, although their attack was repelled. Military reinforcements were being sent to the village to reinforce Army positions.

The company employs some 2,200 persons and achieves annual sales of around 820 million euros (2012). Sachtleben has been a member of the multinational Venator group since 2017. The company's corporate history reaches back over 130 years. Sachtleben produces particles using titanium dioxide, zinc sulfide and barium sulfate as the chemical basis, and markets these products worldwide. The principal applications for Sachtleben products include man-made fibers, paints and other coatings, plastics, and paper. Sachtleben also supplies special particles to the foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries, and has interests in the fields of chromatography, nanotechnology, catalysis, and the production of building materials. The company leads the world in special titanium dioxide grades for printing inks and for the cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food industries. The production facilities at all three locations apply the sophisticated sulfate-route process.  History  Lithopone und Permanentwei√üfabrik Sch√∂ningen AG (\\"The Sch√∂ningen Lithopone and Permanent White Manufactory Corporation\\") was founded in 1878 for the production of a new white paint base on a zinc sulfide/barium sulfate basis. The fledgling company achieved success against competing products only after numerous technical and chemical problems had been overcome, a process in which the young chemist Rudolf Sachtleben played a decisive role. Lithopone, the world's first genuinely durable white paint base, then quickly began to replace the toxic white lead previously used. Rudolf Sachtleben took over management of the company in 1883, becoming a partner in Sachtleben & Co. Lithopone Fabrik (\\"Sachtleben & Co. Lithopone Manufactory\\"), in Sch√∂ningen. The success of the new product, coupled with low-cost recovery of zinc by means of chlorinating roasting of iron pyrites from Meggen, in Germany's hilly Sauerland region, paved the way for rapid expansion. Sachtleben & Co. Lithopone Fabrik thus relocated to Duisburg in 1892, since the Rhine and the nearby Ruhr industrial region even then offered optimum conditions in terms of location, labor, transportation, and supplies of energy and water. By 1906, production had multiplied sixfold, and a second production plant had been constructed. Sachtleben, its workforce and its facilities also suffered from the effects of inflation and the global economic crises during the First World War, the immediate post-war period and the subsequent occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian troops in 1923. Sachtleben Aktiengesellschaft f√ºr Bergbau und chemische Industrie (\\"Sachtleben Joint Stock Mining and Chemicals Corporation\\") was nonetheless founded in 1926, with a paid up capital stock of twelve million marks and registered offices in Cologne. Production of Lithopone grew significantly up to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, while new technologies helped to greatly expand the range of products. Lithopone was needed in Germany during the Second World War both for civil applications and for camouflage paints. Production ground to a halt following severe air-raids in 1944, however, and could be restarted only in 1946, after the repair of war-related damage. The superiority of the properties of titanium dioxide over those of Lithopone in many applications became apparent as early as the mid-1950s. For this reason, Sachtleben and DuPont de Nemours, of Wilmington, Delaware, USA, started a joint venture, Pigment Chemie GmbH, in 1959. Planning and construction of a titanium dioxide and a sulfuric acid plant started in 1960. Sachtleben subsequently began producing titanium dioxide using the sulfate-route process in Duisburg in 1962; annual production of titanium dioxide reached 18,000 tonnes the following year, and is now around 100,000 tonnes each at the Duisburg and Krefeld locations, plus some 130,000 tonnes at Pori, in Finland. In 1973, Sachtleben decide to enter the highly promising water-treatment chemicals segment. The acquisition of EKOKEMI, of Ibbenb√ºren, and thus a simultaneous and comprehensive expansion of the product portfolio in the field of water chemicals, followed in 1996. Sachtleben then consolidated its position as one of Central Europe's leading flocculant producers with the start-up of Mitteldeutsche Wasserchemie (MIWAC; \\"Central German Water Chemicals\\") in 2000. Sachtleben's Water Chemicals division was hived off in the context of the joint venture between Sachtleben and Kemira Oyj in 2008, since the relevant agreement covered only the two companies' pigment production activities. The year 2000 witnessed the construction of a nanotechnology production plant. Ultrafine titanium dioxide particles are used, among other applications, for UV-shielding both in the plastics, the paints and coatings, and the cosmetics industries. The plant is of modular design, enabling it to expand to meet market needs.  Ownership  In 1972, Sachtleben was integrated entirely into Metallgesellschaft AG, the predecessor of mg technologies and the present-day GEA AG. Metallgesellschaft had been the majority shareholder since as early as 1926. Within Metallgesellschaft, Sachtleben became part of the Dynamit Nobel group, a 100% Metallgesellschaft subsidiary. Dynamit Nobel AG was responsible for chemicals activities within the overall Metallgesellschaft (mg technologies) group until 2004, when mg technologies AG divested itself of its chemicals interests, disposing of Dynamit Nobel AG to US specialty chemicals group Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (Princeton, USA). In September 2008, Rockwood Holdings, Inc. entered into a joint venture with Kemira Oyj, of Finland, combining Rockwood's titanium dioxide and functional additives activities (with production based in Duisburg, Germany) and Kemira's titanium dioxide business (with production at Pori, Finland). This joint venture immediately became one of the world's leading producers of titanium dioxide pigments. Production capacity for these specialties increased by a further 100,000 t/a, to 340,000 t/a, with the acquisition in 2012businesswire.com  June 11, 2012  Rockwood‚Äôs Sachtleben Venture Agrees to Acquire crenox Titanium Dioxide Production Assets and Inventory, of the facilities of the insolvent Crenox GmbH competitor, a former Bayer subsidiary, in Krefeld. Rockwood Holdings, Inc. acquired Kemira's stake in the joint venture in early 2013. Sachtleben is thus a 100% subsidiary of Rockwood Holdings, Inc.reuters  Feb 14, 2013  Kemira sells stake in Sachtleben to JV partner Rockwood, Sachtleben was then sold to the Huntsman Corporation in 2014; when Huntsman divested its pigment business in 2017 as Venator, Sachtleben became a part of this company.

Companies can reduce their tax bill or claim payable cash credits as a proportion of their R&D; expenditure. The initiative builds on the existing R&D; Tax Credit scheme which has been in operation for large companies since 2002 and is one of a number of technology tax relief schemes introduced by successive UK Governments. Originally referred to as to as \\"Above the Line R&D; Tax Relief\\", because the payable credit for large companies is now shown above the tax line and can effectively be accounted for as income in the profit and loss statement, RDEC is now the common terminology used for the scheme. History R&D; tax relief is designed to incentivise investment in R&D.; The scheme was introduced in 2000 for small and medium enterprises, with a separate scheme for large companies launched in 2002. Any company carrying out R&D; is likely to qualify for the relief. The definitions of eligible R&D; and costs are reasonably broad, and eligible R&D; can be found in completely unexpected areas. Large companies could previously only offset the credit against corporation tax liabilities. This meant large businesses running R&D; cost centres in the UK, but with profit centres outside the UK, were unable to benefit from the relief. It also meant the credit was largely invisible to R&D; decision-makers because it was embedded in the tax computation. As a result of lobbying from industry, the government launched a consultation in the 2012 Budget on changes to the Large Company R&D; Tax Relief scheme. In the March 2013 Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed the new R&D; Expenditure Credit for large companies with a payable rate of 10 per cent for R&D; expenditure incurred after 1 April 2013 (an increase on the original proposal of a 9.1 per cent payable credit). This credit is designed to make R&D; relief more visible to those making R&D; budgeting and investment decisions. It should also provide better cash flow for companies with no corporation tax liability, and thus should promote the UK as the preferred location for multi-national corporations deciding where to site their R&D; operations. It will also help to improve corporate earnings because it now appears above the tax line. Overview The 10 per cent payable credit rate equates to a net benefit post-tax of 7.7 per cent of eligible expenditure for large companies (at 23 per cent corporation tax from April 2013). The definitions of large and small company size are driven by the EU classifications (and adjusted for UK R&D; Tax Credit purposes) including revenues, number of employees and balance sheet assets. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his 2014 Autumn Statement that the taxable credit available to companies claiming under the RDEC regime has been increased from 10% to 11% providing an after tax benefit of 8.8% of the qualifying R&D; expenditure incurred after April 2015. 2014 Autumn Statement Autumn Statement\\" Retrieved 01 March 2015 The existing large company superdeduction scheme will continue to run in parallel with the RDEC until April 2016, allowing a large company to claim the payable credit above the line or to deduct an additional 30 per cent of its eligible R&D; costs in its tax computation. The steady state cost of the RDEC, after the initial phasing-in period, is forecast to be approximately ¬£265 million per annum (¬£170 million per the original proposal, plus ¬£95 million for the increase in the payable rate to 10 per cent)2012 and 2013 Budget in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by HM Treasury. How it works In all respects, the RDEC will work like the existing R&D; Tax Credit. The nature of the tax relief has not changed, only the method of delivery of the tax relief. There are various principles which need to be respected. Eligible R&D; must be: *seeking to achieve an advance in science or technology *subject to scientific or technological uncertainty *conducted in a systematic and thorough fashion Eligible costs include staffing costs, consumables, software, subcontractors, prototype costs, clinical trial costs and research contributions.https://www.empowerrd.com/resource/which-costs- qualify-for-rd/ Critically these costs must be mapped to the eligible activities. How to claim The claim process is as follows: *assess qualifying R&D; activity *calculate qualifying R&D; expenditure *submit the figures in the CT600 tax return HMRC recommend adequate record-keeping of eligible activities and eligible costs to provide a coherent audit trail in case of an enquiry by HMRC. Details in the legislation to look out for *eligible R&D; activity *eligible R&D; costs Other technology tax reliefs *Research & Development Tax Credit *Research & Development Capital Allowances *Patent Box *Creative Sector Tax Reliefs including Video Games Tax Relief, Animation Tax Relief, High-End TV Production Tax Relief, and Film Tax Relief The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

The judges were Harms JA, Schutz JA, Cameron JA, Conradie JA and Heher JA, who heard the case on May 8, 2003, handing down judgment on May 16, 2003. PJ Heymans appeared for the appellant; MH Wessels SC for the respondents. The case revolved around the requirements for Anton Piller orders. Such orders, the court found, are for preservation of evidence; they are not a substitute for possessory or proprietary claims. They require built-in protection measures such as the appointment of an independent attorney to supervise their execution. The applicant and his own attorney may not form part of search party. The goods seized are to be kept in the possession of the sheriff pending the court's determination. Orders are not to be had simply for asking. Courts must satisfy themselves that a proper case has made out, more so if the subject-matter is of a technical nature. The applicant alleged copyright infringement as basis for application for the Anton Piller order. The documents he was alleged to have copyright in were neither identified nor produced. That the applicant was the author of those documents, together with the originality of alleged works, was not proved to the satisfaction of the court. It was not alleged that there was a written assignment of copyright by the author to the applicant. It appeared that the allegations concerning possible infringement of copyright were purely speculative in their attempt to obtain the order.  Facts  The appellant close corporation had, without notice, brought an urgent ex parte application seeking a rule nisi with interim effect against the first and second respondents. The order, referred to as an Anton Piller order by counsel, was granted by the High Court. The order provided for the removal of goods by the sheriff and the handing over of those goods to the appellant. The sheriff, together with a member of the appellant and the appellant's attorney, duly proceeded to the residence of the first and second respondents, and seized what they wanted. The rule was later discharged by the court; the appellant appealed against this ruling. The first and second respondents had been party to a partnership agreement with the appellant, and wished to withdraw from this agreement. The appellant was prepared to buy them out, but insisted that they agree to a restraint-of-trade clause. The first and second respondents refused to do this. As the original contract had not contained a restraint-of- trade clause, the first and second respondents took steps to begin their own and similar business.  Argument  On the issue of the seizure, the appellant argued that it was entitled to rely on rei vindicatio in relation to some of the items that had belonged to it. The problem faced by the appellant was that the first and second respondents were in possession of the goods in terms of an agreement with the appellant, which agreement had not been cancelled. The appellant further relied on copyright for the relief sought in the application. Counsel was, however, unable to refer to any prayer relating to or based on copyright infringement.  Judgment  The court held that Anton Piller orders were for the preservation of evidence and were not a substitute for possessory or proprietary claims. They required built-in protection measures such as the appointment of an independent attorney to supervise the execution of the order. An applicant and his own attorney could not be part of the search party. The goods seized had to be kept in the possession of the sheriff pending the court's determination. Since it was the duty of the applicant to ensure that the order applied for did not go beyond that which was permitted, and since the Court had granted a rule nisi which it had not been empowered to grant, the setting aside of the rule had to follow as a matter of course.Para 3. The appellant had alleged that it held copyright in documents, but these documents had neither been identified nor produced. Whether the appellant was the author of the relevant documents, and the originality of the alleged works, was further not proved to the satisfaction of the Court. It was also not alleged that there had been written assignment of copyright by their author to the appellant.Para 5. It appeared to the court that the allegations concerning possible infringement of copyright in the founding affidavit had been purely speculative, a suspicion borne out by the results of the sheriff's search.Para 6. The court held, further, as to the reliance on unfair competition, that no trade secrets were alleged. It was impossible to perceive what wrong the appellant relied upon, unless it was lamenting the fact that the first and second respondents wished to compete with it at some time in the future, and that it could not prevent this because of the lack of restraint-of-trade and copyright protection.Para 7. Interim orders and rules nisi, the court held, were not to be had simply for the asking. Courts had to satisfy themselves that a proper case had been made out, more so if the subject was technical.Para 10. The appeal, accordingly, was dismissed, and the decision in the Orange Free State Provincial Division, in Memory Institute SA CC t/a Memory Institute v Hansen and Others confirmed.

Diffusion There are three different types of diffusion: molecular, Brownian and turbulent. Molecular diffusion occurs in gases, liquids, and solids. Diffusion is a result of thermal motion of molecules. Usually, convection occurs as a result of the diffusion process. The rate at which diffusion occurs depends on the state of the molecules: it occurs at a high rate in gases, a slower rate in liquids, and an even slower rate in solids. In gases, molecular diffusion is dependent on pressure and temperature. The higher the pressure, the slower the diffusion takes place, and the higher the temperature, the faster the diffusion takes place. In liquids, an increase in temperature increases the rate of diffusion. However, since liquids are incompressible, the rate of diffusion is not affected by the pressure. The rate of diffusion in solids is also increased by temperature. Heat and mass transfer occurs from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. A simplistic way to picture diffusion is when ink is put on a paper towel; it spreads from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. The equation for this is shown below and is similar to the heat equation. ::N = -D dC/dr where :N is the rate of mass transfer of the diffusing component (moles per second per unit area) :D is the diffusivity variable :dC/dr is the local concentration gradient of the diffusing component Mathematical description of equimolar counterdiffusion However, if a mixture is not of a pure concentration but consists of two species; then it is a binary flow, and the two flows must balance each other. This type of diffusion is referred to as equimolar counterdiffusion, and the two species, A and B, are in combination with each other. As an example, if there are two groups of mixtures containing species A and B connected by a channel, then species A will diffuse in the direction of species B, and vice versa. Specifically, for gases, assuming ideal gas behavior (P=CRuT), the molar concentration C will remain constant since the pressure and temperature are constant. Therefore, the molar flow rates of each species must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: ::·πÑA+·πÑB = 0 In this process, the net molar flow rate of the mixture and the molar-average velocity are equal to zero, and mass transfer occurs by diffusion only without any convection taking place. The mole fraction, the molar concentration, and the partial pressure of both gases involved in equimolar counterdiffusion vary linearly. These relationships can be found in the following equations expressing the molar flow rates for each species, A and B, for a one-dimensional flow through a channel with no homogenous chemical reactions: ::·πÑdiff,A =(CDAB A (yA,1-yA,2))/L = (DAB A (CA,1-CA,2))/L = (DAB A (PA,0-PA,L))/(Ru T L) ::·πÑdiff,B =(CDBA A (yB,1-yB,2))/L = (DBA A (CB,1-CB,2))/L = (DBA A (PB,0-PB,L))/(Ru T L) where :C is the molar concentration :DAB or DBA is the interdiffusion coefficient :P is the partial pressure of the gas :A is the constant cross-sectional area :L is the length of the channel where the mixtures diffuse :y is the mole fraction Application in catalysis We can use this equation to calculate the rate of diffusion in the surface of a catalyst thus: the mole fraction yB,1 is the concentration in the bulk fluid and the concentration yB,2 is the concentration of molecule B liquid at the surface of a catalyst. The diffusion in the bulk fluide compensate the utilisation of B at the surface of the catalyst. kg is the mass transfer coefficient. ::·πÑdiff,B =kg(yB,1-yB,2) Although the mixture is stationary due to the molar flow rate and velocity being zero, the net mass flow rate of the mixture is not equal to zero unless the molar mass of A is equal to the molar mass of B. The mass flow rate can be found using the following equation: ::·πÅ = ·πÅa+·πÅb=·πÑa Ma+·πÑb Mb=·πÑa (Ma+Mb) See also * Fick's laws of diffusion References * \\"Conductive Heat Transfer.\\" Conductive Heat Transfer.

Among the films Mirage produced were The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), Sense and Sensibility (1995), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Iris (2001), and Cold Mountain (2003). By the time of Pollack's death in 2008, Time magazine noted he had become \\"a much more prolific producer, with the pictures he made through his Mirage company tending to be smaller in scale, more eccentric, more personal than his studio pictures had been and he enjoyed godfathering them.\\" References Category:Film production companies of the United States ","title":"Mirage Enterprises"},{"id":"39120074","text":"Heydarabad (, also Romanized as ·∏®eydarƒÅbƒÅd; also known as Heidar Abad Roodbar) is a village in Rudbar Rural District, in the Central District of Rudbar-e Jonubi County, Kerman Province, Iran.

They provide a 100 per cent first year capital allowance for research and development (R&D;) capital expenditure. RDAs are the capital expenditure equivalent to the R&D; tax relief scheme. History RDAs were the new name given to Scientific Research Allowances (which already existed) when the R&D; Tax Credit scheme was launched in 2000.HMRC,\\" ca60100\\" Overview R&D; Tax Relief only applies to revenue expenditure - generally, costs incurred on day-to-day operations, as opposed to expenditure on capital assets. However, RDAs allow relief for R&D; capital expenditure as a capital allowance. RDAs make it possible to claim 100 per cent of the capital cost against taxable profits in the year the cost is incurred. This can deliver a helpful cash flow boost and a shortened payback period. A company should consider applying for RDAs if it has: *constructed or purchased a laboratory, test bed, or pilot plant *capitalised large amounts of R&D; expenditure If any R&D; revenue expenditure is capitalised in a company's accounts, it may still qualify for R&D; Tax Relief or it may only qualify under RDAs. The accounts treatment when the asset is recognised on the balance sheet, as opposed to being written-off immediately in the profit and loss account, is not conclusive of whether the expenditure is revenue or capital for tax purposes. The distinction between revenue and capital expenditure in the context of its R&D; tax treatment is critical. HMRC give details on how to distinguish between the two categories on their websiteHMRC,\\"revenue V capital expenditure\\" and in their CIRD manual.HMRC,\\"CIRD81700\\" Further detail can also be found in section 1308 of Corporation Tax Act 2009Corporation Tax Act,\\"Section 1308\\" (which in turn updated section 53 of Finance Act 2004)Finance Act,\\"Section 53\\" in relation to the revenue treatment of capitalised costs which relate to intangible assets. How it works RDAs are available for expenditure of a capital nature on R&D; related to a company‚Äôs trade, e.g.: *laboratories, *other research facilities, *research equipment, *company cars used by people undertaking the R&D;, and *a new IT system for internal use in the R&D; facility etc. etc. So, unlike for R&D; Tax Relief where only certain categories of expenditure can be claimed, RDAs are available on most expenditure incurred for the carrying out of, or provision of facilities for, R&D; (except land and the cost of acquiring intellectual property). This includes building or premises assets which would not otherwise qualify for alternative forms of capital allowances (such as the Annual Investment Allowance). This means that where a company acquires or builds property with the intention of using the property for the purposes of carrying on qualifying research and development, then most, if not all, of the expenditure involved will qualify for a 100 per cent capital allowance in the accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred. Other technology tax reliefs *Research & Development Tax Credit *Research & Development Expenditure Credit *Patent Box *Creative Sector Tax Reliefs including Video Games Tax Relief, Animation Tax Relief, High-End TV Production Tax Relief, and Film Tax Relief The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

Family and early life Conrad Penny was born on 31 May 1951 in Durban, South Africa, the son of Errol Penny and Nina Hartdegen, Grandson of Magnus Penny and Elizabeth le Sueur, Great-Grandson of Herbert Penny (founder of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in the Cape which ultimately led to the formation of the South African Navy) and Carlotta Forssman (daughter of Chevalier Oscar Wilhelm Alric Forssman). His mother was a granddaughter of Cuninghame Wilson Moore, the older brother of Sir Archibald Gordon Moore, Admiral of the Fleet. In March 2015 he attended the reinterment of King Richard III of England as a guest of Leicester University and Leicester Cathedral. In addition to Penny's royal descent,http://www.thepeerage.com/p50976.htm Professor Kevin Sch√ºrerhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/25/richard-iii-battle-of- bosworth-descendants-meet-for-kings-reburial identified and recognised Penny as a descendant of at least ten other Lords, Knights and soldiers at the 1485 Battle of Bosworth where Richard III lost his life. He was educated at St Stithians College (1964‚Äì65) and Hyde Park High School (1966‚Äì68) in Johannesburg. Penny was privately educated \\"in house\\" at Penny Brothers between 1970 and 1973 where Town Planner Professor EWN Mallows, Quantity Surveyor and Civil Engineer ACM Tyrrell, Company/Property Lawyer PJP Neall and Company/Tax Account AE Hirsowitz were put at his disposal for his tertiary education. He later passed the valuer's exam set by The South African Council for the Property Valuers Profession. Penny married Baroness Maria-Ther√©sia Kotz von Dobrz in Austria on 7 January 1978 and together they have two sons and two daughters. Career In 1996 Penny's company, Penny Brothers Brokers & Valuers (Pty) Ltd., was awarded tenders for the valuation of the whole of Soweto, in Johannesburg, which valuation included over 325 000 dwellings. The tenders were awarded by the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality for taxing and rating purposes. This was the single largest valuation ever undertaken in Africa. Penny is a member of the Institute of Estate Agents of South Africa, a member of the South African Institute of Valuers, appraiser to the Hon. South African Minister of Justice and is registered as a professional valuer with the South African Council for the Property Valuers. Given his interest in anthropology and paleontology, he is also a member of the Royal Society of South Africa. He is the owner of Chartwell Castle in north western Johannesburg, where he laid out the largest permanent hedgerow Maze in the Southern Hemisphere. Philanthropy and civic work Trees - Penny has also propagated approximately 7000 trees at Chartwell Castle which have been donated to the streets, pavements, parks, schools and Places of Worship and Refuge mainly within the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Chartwell Local Area Committee - In around 1988, Penny as Chairman of the Farmall and Farmall Ext. 1 Landowners Association, assisted in the creation of The Greater Chartwell Local Area Committee, in what was then the outlying regions of northern Johannesburg. The merger of the surrounding areas resulted in a rate based income being viable to afford the region with tarred roads along arterial routes and the provision of municipal water supply. Consequently, the sub-division of land became possible and the region has since been incorporated into the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Rand Club - In 2016, Conrad Penny initiated the formation of the Rand Club Salvage Consortium (RCSC) which successfully resuscitated the historic (1887) Rand Club of Johannesburg (and its fine Edwardian building) after it had been mothballed because of a decline in membership following a general exodus from the old CBD of Johannesburg.

Written by Ian Brennan and directed by Bradley Buecker, it aired on Fox in the United States on May 9, 2013. Patty Duke and Meredith Baxter make their only appearances as a lesbian couple, Jan and Liz, who were briefly considered for an ongoing storyline. Jessica Sanchez returns as Frida Romero, a powerhouse singer for a show choir competing against McKinley High's New Directions at Regionals. Meanwhile, Rachel is auditioning for a broadway role. Brittany developes an unusual attitude and gives out weird demands and Blaine reveals that he plans to propose marriage to Kurt after he meets a lesbian couple who legally marry. Brittany finally reveals she was given an acceptance into MIT and says a tearful goodbye to her friends including Santana and Sam. and Ryder refuses to perform at Regionals unless a \\"Catfish\\" is revealed and Will and Emma get married in the choir room. The episode received generally negative reviews, and most critics felt the episodes forced due to the multiple plots in it, but enjoyed the musical performances of Sanchez. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 5.92 million American viewers and received a 2.0/6 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership was up slightly from the previous episode, \\"Wonder-ful\\", which had been broadcast one week previously. Plot Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) announces that Regionals will be held at McKinley High due to bad weather in the competition's original location, Indianapolis. He also encourages the glee club to send well wishes to Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), who is concurrently performing in her callback audition for the Broadway revival of Funny Girl, performing \\"To Love You More\\". Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) visits MIT, where she is dubbed a mathematical genius. Returning to Lima, she becomes arrogant, refuses to perform at Regionals, leaves the Cheerios, and breaks up with Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet). After Will and former cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) fail to get Brittany to change her attitude, Sam gets Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) to return to Lima to intervene. After talking with Santana, Brittany decides to perform at Regionals. Brittany reveals to the glee club she has been offered early admission to MIT and delivers an emotional goodbye, as she will be leaving after Regionals. Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) remains determined to propose to Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer). While shopping for a ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for many years. Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of homosexuals. Noting the increasing number of states legalizing same-sex marriage, Jan proposes to Liz, which further encourages Blaine. Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner) also refuses to perform at Regionals unless \\"Catfish\\" reveals themselves. Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) initially takes the blame, but Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) later confesses to Ryder that she is actually \\"Catfish\\"; Unique has a crush on Ryder and created a false identity to become closer to him. Ryder decides to perform at Regionals for the benefit of the team, but will be leaving the glee club afterward. He also vows never to speak with Unique again. At Regionals, the Hoosierdaddies, led by Frida Romero (Jessica Sanchez), perform \\"Clarity\\" and \\"Wings\\". New Directions performs \\"Hall of Fame\\" and \\"I Love It\\", followed by Marley's original song, \\"All or Nothing\\". New Directions wins Regionals and return to the choir room, where guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) shows up with an officiant and announces that she and Will are getting married immediately. After exchanging vows, Will and Emma celebrate with New Directions, while Blaine holds a jewelry box behind his back. Production 150px Shooting for the episode began on April 11, 2013, in parallel with the previous episode, which had started shooting earlier in the month. Ryan Murphy has described the finale as leaving \\"many cliffhangers\\". Shooting for the episode and the fourth season ended the evening of April 24, 2013. Cory Monteith, who played Finn Hudson, does not appear in the season finale. Monteith entered a rehab facility on March 31, 2013, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. The storyline planned for him was changed, and the scripts for the final two episodes were revised to include replacement scenes for those that had been plotted to include Monteith. Two new characters were introduced in this episode who were briefly expected to continue into the show's fifth season. Patty Duke and Meredith Baxter played Jan and Liz, a lesbian couple in a 25-year committed relationship; Duke's character, who works in a jewelry store, meets Blaine who is shopping for a ring for Kurt. Plans were later cancelled to have the elder couple continue mentoring the younger in season five. Unlike in past seasons, the end of the fourth season does not mean the end of the current school year; classes for it will continue into the fifth season. According to Overstreet, \\"It's one of those finales that's going to be picked right up when season five begins.\\" 150px Special guest star Jessica Sanchez who made a cameo in Lights Out, officially debuts as Frida Romero, the lead singer of the Hoosierdaddies a rival show choir for the New Directions. Other recurring characters in this episode include McKinley High's guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Mays), McKinley's new cheerleading coach Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes), glee club members Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen), Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Newell), Marley Rose (Benoist), Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) and Ryder Lynn (Jenner), and a producer of the Broadway revival of Funny Girl (Amy Aquino). Six songs from the episode are being released as singles: Celine Dion's \\"To Love You More\\" sung by Michele; The Script's \\"Hall of Fame\\" performed by Kevin McHale, Chord Overstreet, Artist, Jenner and Larsen; Zedd and Foxes' \\"Clarity\\" and Little Mix's \\"Wings\\", both performed by Sanchez; Icona Pop's \\"I Love It\\" performed by Morris, Jenna Ushkowitz, Newell and Tobin; and an original song with the same title as the episode, \\"All or Nothing\\", performed by Benoist and Criss.

Jessica Zaleski of Huffington Post wrote that the episode was \\"forgettable\\" and she said the episode just didn't measure up to the other finales of the series. Also she criticized the Will and Emma wedding plot and called it \\"boring and void of emotion\\" and she was concerned that Rachel's audition plot failed to have an end in the fourth season. Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club graded the episode \\"C+\\" he said there's no wonder in the episode and that it feels \\"like just another episode\\" and it seems ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù. He said: ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a rocky, rewarding season limited mostly by its own reticence to move forward‚Äù. Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that the episode did not feel like a finale and called it \\"lackluster\\". She said that enjoyed the presence of Jessica Sanchez as Frida Romero, but considered it unfortunate that Sanchez did not have any lines or plot points, adding that the vocals of Sanchez are \\"astounding\\". Lauren Hoffman of Vulture wrote that the episode had very strong moments and said that the episode felt \\"a little forced\\" due to the many plots in the episode, she also commented that the Brittany plot was more poignant than she would have expected it to be. She enjoyed the performance of \\"Clarity\\" by Frida Romero and the Hoosierdadies, and thought that New Directions winning the regionals was \\"just fine\\". She said that this season wasn't bad at all and it have some good episodes. Mary Ann Sleasman of TV.com said that the episode was \\"predictable\\" and she said that Brittany's early admission in MIT plot was weak and very excessive, also she criticized the writers for not taking the time to show us how Schue and Emma patched up their broken relationship. She said: \\"Season 4 did work as a cohesive unit. It wasn't perfect, but a lot of that can be chalked up to the growing pains associated with figuring out how to switch back and forth between Lima and New York, figuring out what to do with the new students, and figuring out how to utilize the McKinley graduates without overshadowing the new faces‚Äîall of which, to be honest, still need some improvement. But season 4 was very much a transitional season, and when you look at it as such, the season did what it needed to do\\".

As a child, she received almost no formal education but was home-tutored while living with her maternal relatives in upstate New York. Coffin was determined to embark on a career despite the social problems that it would cause for a woman of her class and enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied between 1901‚Äì4 as one of only four women in architecture and landscape design.Fleming, p. 7 After graduating Coffin was unable to find work with established architectural firms, due to widespread prejudice against a woman working in a male-dominated field. She set up her own practice in New York City in 1905, starting out by designing suburban gardens on Long Island. She was one of the first American women to work as a professional landscape architect. Her increasing fame led to larger commissions from wealthy and powerful East Coast families. By the 1920s she was one of the most sought-after landscape architects in the eastern United States. Coffin's clientele included some of the wealthiest and most famous families in the country, including the Fricks, the Vanderbilts, the Huttons, and the du Ponts. Although the number of her commissions was greatly reduced after the onset of the Great Depression in 1930, she continued working almost until her death in 1957 at the age of 80. During her career she worked on over 130 commissions, including dozens of major estate gardens. Among her most notable creations were the gardens of Gibraltar in Wilmington, Delaware, the campus plan of the University of Delaware, the gardens of the Caumsett estate (now Caumsett State Historic Park), and those of Winterthur, Delaware. Early life Coffin with her mother, Alice Coffin was born into a wealthy upper-class family in Scarborough, New York, but grew up almost penniless due to the death of her father, Julian Ravenel Coffin, when she was seven. During her childhood years, Coffin and her mother, Alice (n√©e Church), lived with relatives in Geneva, New York.Fleming, p. 8 She found the beautiful scenery of the area, set in the Finger Lakes of upper New York state, an inspiration; she later wrote, \\"even as a small girl, I loved the country, not so much gardens and growing things, for I had no experience with these ... but simply the great outdoor world.\\"Karson, p. 181 Although the Coffins had little money, their life with Alice's upper-class relatives gave Marian an almost aristocratic upbringing that introduced her to high society on the East Coast and enabled her to make social connections that were to be extremely valuable in later life. However, she received almost no formal education, a deficiency that caused significant problems for her in her college years.Ralph, p. 10 She was instead tutored at home, where she also enjoyed the benefits of exposure to fine art and music and became an accomplished horse rider. As a relatively impoverished member of the upper class, Coffin had no independent income and faced a choice between finding a rich husband or taking up a professional career. She chose the latter, despite the fact that (as noted by Martha Brookes Hutcheson, another early female landscape architect) \\"it was considered almost social suicide and distinctly matrimonial suicide, for a woman to enter any profession.\\"Libby, p. 70 She aspired to find a creative role but recognized the difficulties she faced, as she later wrote: Studies An architect friend suggested that she might like to try \\"landscape gardening\\" (the term used at the time for landscape architecture) a field in which Beatrix Jones Farrand had become a female pioneer during the 1890s. Coffin may also have been influenced by her uncle Benjamin Church, who had worked under Frederick Law Olmsted on the creation of Central Park in New York City.Karson, p. 182 Women at the time were looking beyond the traditional female careers of school teacher, nurse and office clerk, but relatively few educational institutions admitted them to study in male-dominated fields such as architecture or horticulture. One of the exceptions was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which had begun admitting women in 1870, only nine years after its establishment.Libby, p. 69 Coffin applied there but was initially refused entry, as she was not qualified to meet the admission requirements due to her lack of a formal education. However, several of the key faculty members were sympathetic and encouraged her to persevere. She undertook intensive tutoring in mathematics and enrolled at MIT in 1901 as a special student, one of four women enrolled on the architecture course and one of two studying landscape architecture. The four women on the course were the only female members of a 500-strong student body. Stereographic card showing a mechanical drafting studio at MIT, where Coffin studied from 1901‚Äì4 Coffin took the full range of architectural courses including studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and freehand drawing in addition to architectural and landscape design. She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens that combined architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas. Another major influence was Charles Platt, who also followed the Italian tradition of treating the house and gardens as complementary entities, designed as a whole as a series of indoor and outdoor \\"rooms\\". His 1894 book Italian Gardens was a major influence on Coffin's own designs and elements of his work can be recognised in gardens that she executed, such as the Gibraltar Gardens in Wilmington, Delaware. During her course, she spent a summer abroad studying landscape design in France and Italy, as well as going on field trips to study estates in the Boston area, including some designed by Platt.Ralph, p. 11 She particularly excelled at botany and became friends with a fellow student, Henry Francis du Pont, with whom she later collaborated to design the gardens of Winterthur, Delaware.Libby, p. 71 Coffin's college years were nonetheless a \\"long grind\\", as she described it, with a seemingly unrelenting \\"long routine of hard work\\" relieved only by her summer abroad. She and the other three women in the program maintained a friendly competition with the male students which, she said, \\"put us on our mettle to prove that we, too, were serious students and competitors. This association with many types of boys and men I found very helpful as we had a fine spirit of camaraderies in the drafting room and many a helping hand was given me at a critical moment, though one had to steel oneself to hear many a severe criticism, which was perhaps even more valuable.\\" Early career The National Arts Club in New York City, where Coffin lived with her mother from 1905‚Äì27 She graduated in 1904 and travelled to Europe with her mother, visiting well-known gardens and staying with family and friends. Along the way she met Edith Wharton, Henry James and Gertrude Jekyll among others.Karson, p. 183 Jekyll, an influential British horticulturist and garden designer, had a major influence on Coffin's subsequent work. On returning to America, Coffin found that the strongly male- dominated architectural firms were unwilling to employ a woman. She later wrote: She moved to New York City with her mother and took rooms in the National Arts Club in Gramercy Park, Manhattan.Karson, p. 184 Around 1905, Coffin set up her own office at the National Arts Club and began taking commissions, using her family connections to find work. She was ideally situated; it was the height of the Country Place Era, when wealthy East Coast Americans were eager to develop elaborate European-style gardens for their estates. Coffin was well-connected in such circles, widely traveled, came from a good family, was professionally trained and was known for her good taste. She also joined the American Society of Landscape Architects, which had two other female members at the time. Coffin's first jobs were to design small flower gardens such as the suburban garden she designed for Edward Sprague in 1906 in Flushing, Queens. Noted for its original design, it was situated on a modest lot measuring 150 feet by 300 feet (45 m by 91 m), typical of the new suburban developments being built on Long Island at the time. A few years later, she wrote about the Sprague garden in Country Life in America and Elsa Rehmann also discussed it in her 1918 book The Small Place: Its Landscape Architecture. Coffin argued that a \\"moderately well-to-do\\" homeowner could create and maintain a substantial and elaborate garden for a modest expenditure, comparable to that of a mid-range car. She promoted the idea that even the most featureless lot could be beautified through good design: \\"We certainly cannot create a magnificent view, but we can plan and plant beautiful screens and backgrounds that will be interesting at all seasons of the year. We may not easily be able to construct a picturesque diversity at ground level, but we can plant so as to have much height and variety in our flower and shrub groups.\\" As her fame grew, Coffin gained the opportunity to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large enough for her to need an assistant by 1911,Karson, p. 186 and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career. Inter-war career The gardens of Gibraltar (Wilmington, Delaware), designed by Coffin between 1916‚Äì23 King's Gardens next to Fort Ticonderoga, 1921 Among Coffin's significant commissions during this period were the design of a garden for William Marshall Bullitt's Oxmoor estate in Glenview, Kentucky in 1909, probably due to a recommendation from Henry du Pont. The Bullitt commission led to two similar commissions nearby in 1911.Karson, p. 185 In 1910‚Äì11 she also designed gardens for Alfred Boardman in Southampton, New York and for her friend Elizabeth E. Farnum in Norfolk, Connecticut. A relative of the du Ponts, Hugh Rodney Sharp, gave her what was to become one of her best-known commissions in 1916, the creation of the gardens of the Gibraltar estate in Wilmington, Delaware. She designed it in an Italianate Beaux-Arts style as a series of \\"rooms\\" to parallel the layout of the mansion. It has a strongly geometric layout profusely planted in a style reminiscent of an informal English garden. Numerous architectural and decorative elements such as fountains, statues, urns and hand-forged iron gates provide additional ornamentation. Coffin's attempts to find business in the Midwest were thwarted by the well-established presence there of several notable landscape architects in Chicago but she was not short of commissions despite this failure. Her success was recognized by her being elected a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1918, and by the 1920s she was one of the most sought-after East Coast landscape architects. Her work was widely featured in popular magazines and professional journals, at Coffin's own instigation as part of an overt marketing strategy. She sought to reach the wealthy and powerful women who made up an important part of the readership of publications such as the Garden Club of America's Bulletin. Coffin commissioned some of America's leading landscape photographers to take photographs of her creations and promoted her work through slide lectures. Her marketing was highly successful and led to a steady stream of commissions.Karson, p. 188 Most of her commissions were carried out during the 12 years or so between the end of the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee.Karson, p. 187 From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware's landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university's two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women's College to the south) into one cohesive design.Ben- Joseph, E., Ben-Joseph, H.D., & Dodge, A.C. Against all Odds: MIT's Pioneering Women of Landscape Architecture, summary (MIT, Cambridge, MA, 2006) This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university's library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.Hail, M.W. The Art of Landscaping. University of Delaware Messenger, Vol. 2, No. 2, p. 4, (Winter) 1993. Other major projects included gardens for the Bayberryland estate in Shinnecock Hills on Long Island, the Marjorie Merriweather Post estate known as Hillwood in nearby BrookvilleKarson, p. 190 (which is now part of the Long Island University Post Campus) and the huge Caumsett estate (now Caumsett State Historic Park) on behalf of Marshall Field III.Karson, p. 191 Two projects carried out in the late 1920s, for Edgar W. Bassick in Bridgeport, Connecticut and Joseph Morgan Wing in Millbrook, New York led to her being awarded the Gold Medal of Honor by the Architectural League of New York in 1930. In 1926, Coffin fell ill with a serious hip infection that forced her to curtail much of her physical activity and required a lengthy stay in hospital. She moved to a newly acquired house in New Haven, Connecticut, although she continued to maintain her office in New York and commuted there daily. Coffin often entertained guests in New Haven (and recruited several Connecticut notables as new clients), holding teas, cocktail parties, musical events and buffet suppers. The garden, which she had laid out herself, became the site of garden parties in the summer months. She preferred the company of young architects, artists, musicians and writers, though she could be curt towards those she took a dislike to; on one occasion, she snubbed Hilaire Belloc when he asked her which of his books she had read.Karson, p. 193 Later career and death The Reflecting Pool at Winterthur, designed by Coffin for the du Ponts as their family swimming pool with a grand staircase leading down from the East Terrace Coffin's designs were distinguished by her use of \\"dramatic contrasts in color, inclusion of wildflowers and woodland plantings, and site unity through effective transition spaces.\\" She was especially noted for her ability to effectively incorporate functional areas such as tennis courts and putting greens with ornamental areas such as all√©es.Pregill and Volkman, p. 633 Her willingness to innovate made her a particularly sought-after designer as clients came to value a more adventurous approach to landscape architecture. She put into practice the idea put forward in 1918 by Elsa Rehmann that a garden should be a \\"manifestation of distinctive individuality, an expression of personality.\\"Karson, p. 189 By the 1920s, Rehmann's views had become fashionable and gardens became seen as a vehicle for expressing the private self. Many of Coffin's theories and principles can be seen in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career.Karson, p. 194 It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline. The Depression meant that large commissions became few and far between. For the rest of her career, Coffin had to make do with smaller and less well-compensated commissions for suburban gardens. She took up writing and produced two books, Trees and Shrubs for Landscape Effects (1940) and The Seeing Eye. The latter was completed but never published and the manuscript was lost after she died. After the Second World War she carried out several more commissions and continued working on Winterthur until the 1950s. She designed layouts for the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx and travelled extensively in Europe and South America in the late 1940s and early 1950s. She was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York in 1946. On February 2, 1957 she died at her home in New Haven.Ralph, p. 12 Perhaps fulfilling Martha Brookes Hutcheson's prediction that having a career would be \\"matrimonial suicide\\" for a woman of her class, Coffin never married and had no children.Howett, p. 5 Her papers, architectural plans and photographs of her gardens are preserved at the Winterthur Museum and Country Estate.Doumato, p. 55 References Bibliography  Category:American landscape and garden designers Category:Landscape design history of the United States Category:1876 births Category:1957 deaths Category:American gardeners Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Arnold Arboretum Category:People from Hancock County, Maine Category:Architects from New York City Category:People from Briarcliff Manor, New York Category:Women landscape architects Category:American women architects Category:People from Gramercy Park ","title":"Marian Cruger Coffin"},{"id":"39120190","text":"Creative Sector Tax Relief is a programme of tax incentives implemented in the United Kingdom in 2012 which encompass new incentives aimed at supporting the animation, high-end television and video game industries, in addition to the existing relief available for film production. The new reliefs are designed to promote culturally-relevant productions in the UK, to incentivise investment into UK productions that would otherwise take place outside the UK, and to support the necessary critical mass of infrastructure and skills in the UK for both today and in the longer term. History The government announced in the March 2012 Budget that it would introduce corporation tax reliefs from April 2013 for the video game, animation and high-end television industries, subject to State aid approval and following consultation. These new reliefs were confirmed in Budget 2013\\"Budget statement 2013\\" Retrieved on 15 May 2013 and the draft Finance Bill 2013.\\"Finance Bill 2013\\" Retrieved on 15 May 2013 Up to this point, the creative industries had struggled to access existing technology tax relief because the qualifying definitions of schemes such as R&D; Tax Relief have fallen outside the creative sectors, even though companies in these sectors are often pioneers in new and advanced technologies. The reliefs will bring the UK‚Äôs creative sector tax regime into line with other countries such as Canada\\"Canadian Film Tax Relief\\" Retrieved on 15 May 2013 and Japan which already have specific tax reliefs for the creative industries. Overview Production companies in all three industries are able to claim an additional deduction worth 100 per cent of UK qualifying production expenditure (where qualifying expenditure is a maximum of 80 per cent of total production expenditure) and, if they are loss-making, they will be able to surrender such losses for a payable tax credit worth 25 per cent of UK qualifying production expenditure (ie. effectively a payable credit of a maximum 20 per cent of total production expenditure). These reliefs are modelled on the existing film tax relief scheme, which has supported over ¬£5 billion of investment into British films and seen a 70 per cent increase in the film production workforce since its introduction in 2007\\"Creative Sector Tax Relief Treasury response\\" Retrieved on 15 May 2013 The draft Finance Bill 2013 legislation allowed for qualifying expenditure incurred after 1 April 2013 to be eligible for the reliefs subject to State aid approval by the European Commission. The Commission approved the animation tax relief and high-end television production tax relief to start on 1 April 2013 once the regulations come into force with the Royal Assent of the 2013 Finance Act in August 2013. Video game tax relief was given State aid approval by the EU Commission in March 2014, meaning that it came into effect from 1 April 2014. The steady state cost, after the initial phasing-in period, of the reliefs is forecast to be approximately ¬£120 million per annum (¬£55 million for video game tax relief and animation tax relief, plus ¬£65 million for high-end television production tax relief) in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by HM Treasury. The estimated annual administrative cost for HMRC of running all three new creative industry tax relief regimes will be approximately ¬£500,000). They will also set up a specialist unit to facilitate claims for animation and video game relief (but not high-end tv production). Cultural test Productions must be certified by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) as culturally British in order to be eligible for relief, as per the existing Film Tax Relief. The cultural tests for each relief were published in the draft Finance Bill 2013 . The cultural tests will be handled by the British Film Institute on behalf of DCMS as follows: *Animation tax relief - BFI cultural test application form\\"BFI animation cultural test application form\\" Retrieved on 01 March 2015 *High-end tv production tax relief - BFI cultural test application form\\"BFI high end TV cultural test application form\\" Retrieved on 01 March 2015 *Video game tax relief - BFI cultural test application form\\"BFI cultural test application form\\" Retrieved on 01 March 2015 Other technology tax reliefs * Video Games Tax Relief - The Video Games Tax Relief (VGTR) was established in 2014 to help support creativity in the UK games industry. The key benefit of the tax relief is that qualifying companies can claim up to 20% of their ‚Äúcore expenditure‚Äù back, provided that expenditure has been made in the European Economic Area (EEA). * Animation Tax Relief * High-End TV Production Tax Relief * Research & Development Tax Credit * Research & Development Expenditure Credit * Research & Development Capital Allowances * Patent Box * Film Tax Relief The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax-relief to individuals who invest in small early-stage businesses. Public consultation and working groups The government ran a public consultation exercise in summer 2012 on the proposals for Creative Sector Tax Reliefs. Respondents included industry participants (The Walt Disney Company; Channel 4; Electronic Arts; Aardman Animations) the financial services community including large accounting firms (PWC; Deloitte) and independent consultants (MMP Tax); and trade bodies such as The Independent Games Developers Association (TIGA). The government also established industry-focused working groups for the animation, high-end television and video game industries to complement wider consultation on the new tax reliefs and to discuss options and proposals in more detail.

The division was part of the second wave of cavalry division formed during the war. The division spent almost three months in the rear before being deployed to the front. In October the division moved to the Volga Military District to join the 10th Army. The division, along with the 41st and 75th Cavalry Divisions, was assigned to Mishulin's Cavalry Group, the mobile group for the 10th Army. The group minus the 41st Cavalry Division was assigned to attack the flank of the German 2nd Panzer Army south of Tula. Before it was fully committed, the group was assigned to the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps. It was then transferred to the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps of the Western Front - January 1942 to 21 March 1942. Then the division participated in one of the greatest cavalry raids of the war.

It was built in 1911 by the Finnish Missionary Society under the leadership of Selma Rainio. The hospital was operated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (ELCIN) via Lutheran Medical Services until 2016, when the Government of Namibia took over. Onandjokwe State Hospital is located in the Ondangwa Area in Oshikoto Region. Ondangwa town has a population of 36,800 according to the 2011 census data and has a small airport serviced by two daily Air Namibia commercial flights from Windhoek‚Äôs Eros Airport. Onandjokwe serves as the primary health care centre for the Onandjokwe District of the Oshikoto Region which has a size of approximately 25 000 km¬≤. According to the most recent census data of 2011, the population of the Oshikoto Region is 181,600 of which Oniipa make up a population of 24 800. Onandjokwe is staffed by 240 nurses, both full-time nurses and nursing students, as well as by 22 doctors. The Hospital has 470 beds, ten different wards and 9 smaller clinics and other services.  History  Onandjokwe hospital was the first medical centre in northern Namibia. It was officially opened in 1911. It is also the first building in this part of the country to have a corrugated iron roof. The hospital is located east of the Oniipa settlement in Ondonga Kingdom and is situated near a valley that was infested with black birds locally known as oondjohwi from which the hospital derives its name. Oral history claims that king Kambonde of Ondonga, who allocated the land to the missionaries to construct the hospital on, deliberately chose the site as it was a sacred for traditional healers. It was felt that it would be wise for all health practitioners to be in the same vicinity. In October 1908 the Finnish Evangelic Lutheran Mission sent Dr Selma Rainio with two female missionaries to Ondonga ‚Äì Ovamboland in what was then South West Africa. She arrived in Ovamboland in December 1908. Rainio was born on 21 March 1873 in Saarij√§rvi in Central Finland to Anton Lilius and Amanda Sofia Perden. She developed a strong religious belief at the age of 17 after her recovery from a serious typhoid fever. Her desire to become a doctor came about as a result of nursing her father who had suffered a stroke. Rainio registered at the University of Helsinki in 1896. When she graduated there was a search for missionary doctors to China and Africa. She chose the work of a missionary doctor in Africa. The Church was the centre of this hospital. Dr. Rainio believed in prayer and insisted that prayers be a necessary practice conducted at the hospital‚Äôs outpatient wards and especially at the theatre. Rainio started treating patients at Oniipa Mission Station, without a hospital. Being the first doctor in the area, she is said to have treated up to 40 people daily without an assistant. The need for a hospital became apparent and a piece of land was allocated to the Missionary Society for the purpose of building a hospital. The need for a hospital became apparent as a result of inadequate medical supply during 1911 when large number of people where dying as a result of the famine and an epidemic that swept Ondonga from 1907-1909. Rainio, later affectionately known as \\"Kuku gwaNandjokwe\\" (meaning Onandjokwe‚Äôs grandmother) by the natives that needed a proper hospital to provide urgent treatment for the people, was appointed the District Surgeon and leader of the hospital. The hospital consisted of a one block building and had an out-patient clinic, a pharmacy, an operating room, and rooms for staff. The hospital was also used as training hub for aspiring nurses. By 1938 the Onandjokwe hospital boasted with an operating room equipped with anaesthetic, air conditioning, electricity lighting, sterilisers and an operating table. Rainio died at Onandjokwe in January 1939 after 31 years of service, and is buried in the hospital cemetery Oniitewa with her patients and her co-workers.  Onandjokwe Medical Training School  Nurses began formal training at Onandjokwe Hospital in 1930 by Dr Selma Rainio, who was assisted by Dr Karin Hirn. Onandjokwe was the first School of Nursing to be established in Namibia. The school began with four students, of which three were men and one was a woman in 1930. In 1961, the school of Auxiliary Nursing was officially recognised by the South African Nursing Council and in 1964 the School of Midwifery was officially recognised by the South African Nursing Council. By 1994, the School of Nursing was accredited by the University of Namibia to train nurses. By 2011, the school has trained many nurses in the following categories: * Nursing Assistants * Enrolled Nurses * Midwives * Registered Nurses Today, the Onandjokwe School of Nursing is also known as Oshoopala and is considered to be alive and vibrant.  Fire  By 1958 the hospital consisted out of about 70 buildings made up by \\"Rondawels\\" or round thatched huts which were enclosed with clay walls to act as in-patient wards, there were nurses accommodation, a kitchen, a workshop and other hospital facilities. On 4 October 1958 a fire broke out, legend has it that a crow picked up a piece of porridge which boiled over and perched on one of the thatched roofs to consume the porridge, unfortunately the porridge contained some live ember, causing the thatch roof to catch fire (Ntuleni and Shiweda 2011, p. 43). Within an hour, approximately 40 buildings had burnt down, engulfing many of the medical equipment and diesel generator. Miraculously no lives were lost as the community, Finnish and Ovambo health workers demonstrated great co-operation and teamwork to care for the patients and to fight the fire. In the aftermath, the damage was estimated at an astounding ¬£45 000.00 (Ntuleni and Shiweda 2011, p. 43) Some rumours cited the fire as a curse to the Ondonga kingdom, but this was laid to rest quickly as the Ondonga community had learned to trust the people and the work being done by the hospital. Nearly a 100 years later, the Namibian government in conjunction with the Finnish Churches renovated the Onandjokwe hospital. While construction of the water networks was underway, a piece of burnt wood, believed to be remainders of one of the wooden poles used in the huts, was discovered. The woods shape resembled that of wings and Rev. Juluis Mtuleni immediately dubbed it \\"the Angel\\". He asked a welder, Mr Jarmo Lehtine to attached it to an angel shaped piece of iron. This angel is now believed to protect the hospital from bad things and has since become the logo for the Onandjokwe Medical museum.  Present  Onandjokwe Hospital, which serves as the primary health care facility for the Onandjokwe District of the Oshikoto Region, is still run by the Lutheran Church of Namibia via Lutheran Medical Services and subsidized by the Government of the Republic of Namibia. The Onandjokwe District has a size of approximately 25 000 km with an annual growth rate of 2.2%. Today, Onandjokwe Hospital, one of the oldest hospitals in the Northern part of Namibia has 470 beds and 10 different wards for Gynaecology, Medical Male, Medical Female, Surgery Female, Maternity, Surgery Male & ICU, Paediatric, TB, Communicable diseases, Private Ward and the 11th ward which, by 2004 was not in use, but was planned to be a low cost ward employs 240 nurses, both full-time and nursing students, as well as 22 doctors. Census figures of 2001 indicated that the population of the catchment area was 147 179, and with an annual growth of 2.2%, this figure is expected to have been around 187000 by end of 2012 and the number of nursing staff and doctors would have increased proportionally. It has been recorded that Onandjokwe Hospital had a total of 260 410 visits in 2004 and 75% of these were first visits and 15% were examined by a doctor. There are also a number of smaller clinics and services including Eye clinic, Dental clinic, Rehabilitation therapy, X-ray department, Mortuary, Pharmacy, Social work, Antenatal Care and Pathology laboratory which is run by Namibia Institute of Pathology. There is also a nursing college with an annual student intake of between 100 and 150. The entire Health District has a high and rising number of HIV-positive people who become hospital patients at Onandjokwe. The hospital's facilities were over-utilised as a result until in May 2005 a separate HIV/AIDS centre was opened. The Shanamutango Centre for Integrated Care and Support is the hospital‚Äôs newest building and is specifically designed for the provision of treatment to HIV patients.

She has worked for Time magazine, The New York Times, Le Figaro, and National Geographic. She is particularly known for focusing on women's issues in her work, and has been a member of the Rawiya women's photography collective which she co-established in 2011.Megan Gibson, \\"Rawiya: Photography Collective Finds Strength in Numbers\\", Time, November 3, 2011.Alyssa Coppleman, \\"Photos of Women Who Could Go to Prison for Singing for Men\\", Slate, October 3, 2012. Tavakolian is a full member of Magnum Photos. Career Born and brought up in Tehran, at age 16, Tavakolian took a six-month photography course, after which she began working as a professional photographer in the Iranian press. She started at the women's daily newspaper Zan, and later worked for other nine reformist dailies, all of which have since been banned. She covered the July 1999 student uprising, using her Minolta with a 50mm lens, and her photographs were published in several publications. However she was forced to go on hiatus from her photojournalist work following the \\"chaos\\" of Iran‚Äôs presidential election in 2009. During this time, she began other projects focusing on art using photography as well as social documentary. Tavakolian‚Äôs photographs became more artistic and involved social commentary. She got her international break in 2001 at age 21, when she met J.P. Pappis, founder of Polaris Images, New York at a photography festival in Perpignan, France. She began covering Iran for Polaris Images, in the same year, and started working as a freelancer for The Times in 2004. Tavakolian has worked internationally, covering wars, natural disasters and social documentary stories in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Yemen.Biography and introduction of Tavakolian in Persian Her work has been published by international magazines and newspapers such as Time magazine, Newsweek, Stern, Le Figaro, Colors, New York Times Magazine, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, NRC Handelsblad and National Geographic.BBC reports \\"8 o'clock\\" gallery in Persian Common themes in her work are photo stories of women, friends and neighbours in Iran; the evolving role of women in overcoming gender-based restrictions; and contrasting the stereotypes of western media. Her photo projects include Mother of Martyrs (2006), Women in the Axis of Evil (2006), The Day I Became a Woman (2010) and Look (2013). Tavakolian was part of the 2006 Joop Swart Masterclass organized by World Press Photo. In 2007 she was a finalist for the Inge Morath Award.\\"Newsha Tavakolian (Iran): Iran, Girl Power!

She lives and works in Tehran and is married to the Dutch journalist Thomas Erdbrink.Gladstone, Rick. \\"Iran Bars Times Correspondent From Reporting\\". The New York Times, June 20, 2019 (accessed 2019-09-17). In 2019, the Iranian authorities barred her from working in the country.\\"Photographer Newsha Tavakolian Barred from Working in Iran\\". Artforum, June 11, 2019 (accessed 2019-09-17). Controversy In 2014, Tavakolian won a 50,000 euro photojournalism prize from French investment banker Edouard Carmignac and his foundation, the Fondation Carmignac. Tavakolian was to create her vision of Iran with a project she called \\"Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album.\\"Tavakolian, Newsha. 2015. Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album. Heidelberg: Kehrer. This project followed the lives of a diverse group of Iranian people who had been teenagers during the revolution. To Tavakolian's dismay, Carmignac wanted to tamper with her work. He insisted that she give the project a clich√© title, \\"The Lost Generation,\\" as well as removing the accompanying text that discussed her experience living in Iran. Tavakolian said, \\"I am not a delicate flower. I just want to take responsibility for my own work. Defend myself? I can. But if someone else paints me into a corner, how can I defend myself? I have covered a lot of events here, but always with me being responsible for my decisions.\\" Tavakolian has since returned the reward. Her decision stems from her sentiments towards the West, as she actively denies Western influence on her art. This is central to her career as an Iranian artist. She stated, \\"When we‚Äôre stuck on getting the West to understand Iran, our work remains on the surface. I want to tell Iranians' story to Iranians themselves, this is where I can challenge myself and go deeper into the more complicated layers.\\" Her work aims to be devoid of Western influence, as it is not intended for Western audiences. Tavakolian's work continues to be a real, personal representation of Iran. This is the focus of her work. Newsha Tavakolian has had several controversial projects in the Islamic world. Her project \\"Listen\\" focuses on women singers who are not allowed to perform solo or produce their own CDs due to Islamic regulations in effect since the 1979 revolution. In addition to creating potential CD covers for female Muslim singers, Tavakolian includes portraits of the female singers, with eyes closed, mouths open, and passion on their faces. These women were so terrified of being photographed, Tavakolian spent almost a year convincing them to participate in the photo shoot. The women in the photographs are all professional singers who have stifled careers. According to the Islamic tenet, women are not allowed to sing to men. To make a living, these women can only sing at all-female parties, sing background vocals, or perform outside Iran. Thus, her work can be considered highly controversial to Muslim societies, in addition to countries that champion Islam. In June 2016, the Media Development Authority (MDA) of Singapore censored 33 of Tavakolian's photographs planned for her I Know Why the Rebel Sings exhibition, as part of the Singapore International Festival of Arts pre-festival The O.P.E.N. programme, at the last minute. 15 of these photographs, picturing female rebels fighting against ISIS, were presented at the show, limited to those above 16 years old, blacked out. Festival director Ong Keng Sen issued a statement condemning MDA's move and lack of explanation and pointing out that the photographs were already published in the readily accessible Time magazine, both online and off. \\"And so we are living with a new terror where we don't know, it is out of our control,\\" he said at the exhibition's launch.

A \\"pioneer in the application of modular seating,‚ÄùStanley Abercrombie, George Nelson: The Design of Modern Design (1955), p. 321. many of his ideas have been adopted by other designers.  Early life and education  Harvey Probber was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1922. While attending Samuel J. Tilden High School, he took a part-time job in a used-furniture store, and was inspired to try his hand at drawing ideas for furniture. Probber sold his first sofa design when he was just 16, for $10.Harvey Probber, interviews with Judith Gura, Fall, 1988. Miscellaneous autobirographical notes, typed and handwritten, undated. Probber family archives. After high school graduation, he accepted a job as designer for Trade Upholstery, a small manufacturing facility on West 17th Street.Trade Upholstery shop, promotional letter to customers, December 10, 1941. (The salary figure, from Probber‚Äôs notes, seems high for the time). 1940 was the beginning of American modernism, a time characterized by young designers with talent, initiative, and a willingness to take risks with new ideas. Probber was one of an early band of pioneers in a field that included D.J. DePree of Herman Miller, Hans Knoll, Georg Tanier and Jack Lenor Larsen.He was linked with these and other august names in references of the time (e.g., Interior Design, May 1979, p.32).  Design career and Harvey Probber, Inc.  Probber established Harvey Probber, Inc., in 1945 and in the middle years of the twentieth century, Harvey Probber became one of America's leading designers.In 1957, home furnishings editor Grace Madley referred to him as ‚Äúone of the nation‚Äôs leaders in contemporary furniture design.‚Äù (The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 2, 1957), and his work was featured prominently in other media of the time. Though he considered himself a modern designer, his approach to modernity favored exotic woods, highly polished lacquer, hand- rubbed finishes and opulent upholstery fabrics‚Äîmaterials largely abandoned by more radical, Bauhaus-influenced designers. Probber's designs, like those of Edward Wormley, Tommi Parzinger, were sought after by customers who wanted modern furniture with elegance. In 1947, when showroom space wasn't available in Chicago‚Äôs Merchandise Mart, he took his line to Grand Rapids, then the center of the furniture manufacturing industry. In 1948, seeing the potential in the interior design market he opened a showroom at 136 Fifth Avenue, catering exclusively to designers.Harvey Probber, interview and subsequent conversations with the Judith Gura, Fall, 1998. In little over a decade, Harvey Probber, Inc. became one of the country‚Äôs leading contemporary furniture firms. His elastic sling chair and Nuclear upholstered groups were chosen for MoMA‚Äôs Good Design exhibition in 1951,Interiors, June 1951, p. 120 (The Good Design exhibitions took place from 1950 to 1955). and he won several prestigious Roscoe industry awards.The Roscoe awards were presented annually by the Resources Council, an authoritative trade association of suppliers to the interior design industry  Modular seating  Probber‚Äôs most significant design breakthrough came when he was exploring approaches to seating furniture and found that, ‚Äúthe key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry‚Ä¶ they were meaningless alone, but when fused to conventional shapes, profoundly altered their character.‚ÄùHarvey Probber unpublished article, undated. Probber family archives. These ‚Äúbits and pieces‚Äù became templates for the line he named the Sert Group (after architect Jose Luis Sert). It consisted of nineteen different elements that could be assembled into any desired seating configuration. Probber referred to the concept as a modular system, and the individual pieces as modules. Although what was then called ‚Äúunit furniture‚Äù dates to the first decades of the twentieth century, Probber's modular seating was the first of its kind. Taking the concept further, he introduced ‚Äúnuclear furniture‚Äù‚Äîwhich included occasional tables with interchangeable pedestals, in different shapes and sizes that could, like seating, be clustered in varying configurations. In the 1960s, he extended the idea to case goods, making it possible to offer many variations on one basic design... the same case was available in a choice of finishes, legs, bases, heights, and hardware.His first case goods were introduced in 1951 (Interiors, June, 1951, p.120), but the modularity and flexibility options were added in later collections. Differences that were cosmetic rather than conceptual were economical to produce‚Äîevidence that Probber's business acumen matched his design ability. By the 1970s, Harvey Probber, Inc. had opened trade showrooms in major design centers across the country,As of 1967, there were showrooms in five major cities, with the New York showroom occupying a 12,000-square-foot space in the D&D; Building at 979 Third Avenue (Interiors, December 1967, p. 118, July, 1962, p. 98, February, 1957, p. 98). and had relinquished the residential market for the larger and more lucrative contract furniture field. During this period, Probber's work was awarded two \\"Best of Neocon\\" Gold Awards from the Resources Council of the Institute of Business Designers for the Houston Chair (1977) and the Advent III Customization Program (1981). He never abandoned his interest in seating modules, however, and continued to explore variations of the concept.  Current reintroduction  The Harvey Probber Design Archive recently signed an agreement with M2L to reintroduce his iconic furnishings to the American market. In Fall of 2013, a selected group of Probber designs will be reintroduced in a licensed collection by M2L under the name \\"M2L BRAND for Harvey Probber.\\" The first line of products will include a lounge chair, sofa, occasional table, bench and desk from the Architectural Series and the Deep Tuft sectional sofa.\\"Sink Into an Iconic Sofa,\\" The Wall Street Journal (Friday, April 5, 2013) : https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324685104578388701615057198  In his own words  \\"Design has a fourth dimension‚Äîthe intangible quality of aging gracefully.\\"‚Äî1958 Merchandise Mart Conference Address. \\"Too often in our search for newness, we have overlooked the essentials.

In addition to TRU- SPEC's on-duty gear and apparel, the company also manufactures various types of off-duty clothing. ATLANCO ATLANCO's offices are located in Marietta, Georgia. History The Atlanta Army Navy Company was founded by the Zaglin family in 1950 as a military surplus retailer. It was renamed \\"ATLANCO\\" (an acronym for Atlanta Army Navy Company) in the late 1980s. The brand name TRU- SPEC was later created reflecting the fact that the uniforms the company manufactures met all of the U.S. Government's \\"true specifications\\" by using the United States mil-spec fabrics. The TRU-SPEC brand later expanded from core military apparel to public safety and law enforcement, as well as outdoor apparel. Manufacturing In 1996, ATLANCO opened its first manufacturing facility in Honduras under the company name \\"Basic Apparel\\". In 2004, it relocated to a 100,000-square foot facility in La Ceiba, Honduras. This facility allows the entire manufacturing process to be housed under one roof, with room for expansion. Currently, this factory supports over 900 employees. In 2009 the facility was ISO 9001:2008 and NFPA-certified, and thus enabled to manufacture fire retardant clothing. ATLANCO now has strategic partnerships with manufacturers in Indonesia, Korea, China, and the Dominican Republic.

She was a leader in calling attention to the problems faced by women in the workforce, in particular sexual harassment. Sexual harassment In 1974 she was hired by Cornell University as director of the university's Women's Section and lecturer for a field study course called Women and Work. In a 1974 consciousness raising discussion connected with that course, she began to realize the extent of the problem that she later termed \\"sexual harassment\\". As the women in the class described their experiences in the workplace she noticed a pattern: every woman there had either quit or been fired from a job because they had been made so uncomfortable by the behavior of men. She discovered that this phenomenon of male harassment and intimidation of female workers had not been described in the literature and was not publicly recognized as a problem, although she continued to hear it described by women from all walks of life. In 1975, inspired by the case of Carmita Wood, an administrative assistant to Cornell professor Boyce McDaniel, the group at Cornell formed the anti-harassment organization Working Women United. Wood had resigned after she developed physical symptoms due to the stress of fighting off McDaniel's persistent sexual advances. After Cornell denied her unemployment compensation, Wood approached the Human Affairs Office, which was staffed by Farley and two other committed feminists, Susan Meyer and Karen Sauvign√©. In April 1975 she testified before the New York City Human Rights Commission Hearings on Women and Work, led by Eleanor Holmes Norton. She defined sexual harassment as \\"unwanted sexual advances against women employees by male supervisors, bosses, foremen or managers.\\" She gave examples: \\"It often means that a woman is hired because she is pretty, regardless of her qualifications; that a woman's job security is eternally dependent on how well she pleases her boss, and he often thinks sexual companionship is part of the job description; and that women are fired because they have aged or they are too independent or they say 'no' to sexual byplay.\\" A New York Times reporter who heard her testimony wrote about it, and by the end of 1975 her message had reached a national audience. Government agencies began to recognize sexual harassment as a problem to be addressed. Norton's Human Right's Commission added language to their affirmative action agreements guaranteeing \\"protection to male and female employees alike against unfair abuse of sexual privacy\\". Over the following decades Farley gave numerous public and academic presentations on the topic, and served as a consultant to the U.S. Department of Labor, the AFL-CIO, civil rights organizations and women's study programs. She wrote a book, Sexual Shakedown: The Sexual Harassment of Women on the Job, published by McGraw-Hill in 1978 and in a paperback version by Warner Books in 1980. In it she traced the history of sexual harassment as a longstanding issue and gave contemporary examples, such as help-wanted advertisements implying that acceptance of sexual interaction was part of the job description. The book established sexual harassment as an important topic on the feminist agenda. The Christian Science Monitor said the book was \\"an overdue alert to the sexual harassment of working women by male employers which starkly reveals the emotional and physical degradations inflicted on women in the exploitive politics of power at their most base.\\" In 1981 she collaborated on the 33-minute documentary The Workplace Hustle, produced by Woody Clark and Al Brito and narrated by Ed Asner. Farley was a consultant and also appeared in the film. It was intended as a training film for workplaces, and it was widely used for that purpose by government agencies as well as corporations like Xerox and Hewlett-Packard. It won awards at the San Francisco Film Festival and the New York Film Festival. . Background and personal life Her parents, Vincent and Beatrice Farley, were working-class people; both were shop stewards in their respective unions. Her parents had little education, but read widely. She later commented, \\"My mother had a hard life and all her dreams were stifled. I know that I became a feminist and wrote Sexual Shakedown in part because I had become sensitized from her experiences as a working woman.\\" She attended local public schools in New Jersey, then started and dropped out of several colleges before going to the University of Southern California on a journalism scholarship. Before graduation she went to work for the Associated Press in New York as a reporter and feature writer. She taught at Cornell from 1974 to 1976, then became a freelance consultant on women's issues while writing her book. She received a master's degree in Eastern and Western Psychology from Naropa University in 1985. She earned a PhD in Eastern Psychology from the California Institute of Integral Studies in 1993; her thesis was titled \\"The secret world of men: Men's attitudes, beliefs, fantasies and desires with regard to women and children\\". She lived in Taipei for three years while writing for the English- language publication Free China Journal. Returning to the United States, she became a consultant to computer companies on human factors engineering. Current projects include expanding her doctoral thesis into a book about how men are socialized about sex, and a book tentatively titled The Reluctant Caretaker about caring for her elderly mother.

Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development. Molecular Ecology 12: DOI: 10.1111/mec.13490 Epigenetics examines the set of chemical reactions that switch parts of the genome on and off at strategic times and locations in the organism's life cycle. However, epigenetic theories tangle a multiplicity of initiating causes and of resulting final effects and will never lead to a single cause or a single result. Hence, any interpretation of such theories may not focus just one isolated reason of a multiplicity of causes or of effects. Instead of affecting the organism's DNA sequence, non-genetic factors may cause the organism‚Äôs genes to express themselves differently. DNA in the human body is wrapped around histones, which are proteins that package and order DNA into structural units. DNA and histone are covered with chemical tags known as the epigenome, which shapes the physical structure of the genome.\\"The Epigenome at a Glance.\\" Genetic Science Learning Center. The University of Utah, 2013. Web. 10 Apr. 2013. It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments. The idea of epigenetics and gene expression has been a theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers examined the effects of epi-marks buffering XX fetuses and XY fetuses from certain androgen exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and gene regulation through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality.Richards, Sabrina. \\"Can Epigenetics Explain Homosexuality?.\\" The Scientist. N.p., 1 Jan. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013. The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert sexual preference in individuals without altering genitalia or sexual identity.\\"National Geographic Explains the Biology of Homosexuality.\\" YouTube. YouTube, 04 Feb. 2009. Web. 13 Apr. 2013. This research gives support to the hypothesis that homosexuality stems from the under expression of certain genes on the DNA sequence involved with sexual preferences. This theory as well as other concepts involved with epi-marks, twin studies, and fetal androgen signaling will be explored here.  Epigenetic marks  Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are temporary \\"switches\\" that control how our genes are expressed during gestation and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks are modifications of histone proteins.Ruthenburg, A., C. Allis, and J. Wysocka. \\"Methylation of Lysine 4 on Histone H3: Intricacy of Writing and Reading a Single Epigenetic Mark.\\" Molecular Cell 25.1 (2007): 15-30. Print. Epigenetic marks are modifications of the methyl and acetyl groups that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function and as a result, alter gene expression.Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB M√ºller Evolution, the expanded synthesis Epi-marks change how the histones function and as a result, influence the way genes are expressed.William R. Rice, Friberg, Urban and Sergey Gavrilets. \\"Homosexuality as a Consequence of Epigenetically Canalized Sexual Development.\\" The Quarterly Review of Biology 87.4 (2012): n. pag. Print. Epigenetic marks promote normal sexual development during fetal development. However, they can be passed on to offspring through the process of mitosis. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to masculinization of female offspring and feminization of male offspring.\\"Gene Regulation May Explain How Homosexuality Flourishes.\\" LiveScience.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013. However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.  Twin studies  Identical twins have identical DNA, which leads to the perceived conclusion that all identical twins are either heterosexual or homosexual. However, it is evident that this is not the case, consequently leaving a gap in the explanation for homosexuality. A \\"gay\\" gene does not produce homosexuality. Rather, epigenetic modifications act as temporary \\"switches\\" that regulate how the genes are expressed. Of the pairs of identical twins in which one twin is homosexual, only twenty percent of the other twins are homosexual, which leads to the hypothesis that even though identical twins share the same DNA, homosexuality is created by something else rather than the genes. Epigenetic transformation allows the on and off switching of certain genes, subsequently shaping how cells respond to androgen signaling, which is critical in sexual development. Another example of epigenetic consequences is evident in multiple sclerosis in monozygotic (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After gene testing, it was suggested that DNA was identical and that epigenetic differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.Handunnetthi, Lahiru, Adam Handel, and Sreeram V. Ramagopalan. Contribution of Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Differences to Twin Discordance in Multiple Sclerosis. Ebsco Host. Psyc Info, 2010. Web.  Effects of fetal androgen exposure  While in the fetal stages, hormonal influences of androgen, specifically testosterone, cause feminine qualities in regard to sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males. In typical sexual development, females are exposed to minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed to high levels of testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks play a critical role in this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure. However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.Brook, Charles, Gerard S. Conway, and Melissa Hines. \\"Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH).\\" Journal of Sex Research 41.1 (2004): 75-81. Online  Heritability  New epi-marks are usually produced with each generation, but these marks sometimes carry over between generations. Sex- specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex from the natural disparity in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized‚Äîsome affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization can lead to a reversed sexual preference. For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high testosterone, and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks are normally erased and not passed between generations. However, they can sometimes escape erasure and are then transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. When this happens, this may lead to an altered sexual preference. Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that gene coding for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to same-sex sexual preference in offspring.

It was written by Holly Schlesinger and directed by Don MacKinnon. It aired on Fox in the United States on April 14, 2013. Plot While the Belchers are on their way to the movie theater, their car breaks down and Jimmy Pesto takes advantage of the situation to mock Bob relentlessly. Leaving the car at the roadside, they decide instead to see the taping of a television show at the local studio. Bob runs across Chuck Charles, with whom he has a history (see \\"Beefsquatch\\"), and who is now the host of Family Fracas, a game show styled after Double Dare that offers a new minivan as its grand prize. Over Chuck's objections, and spurred on by Linda and the kids, Bob agrees to let his family compete against the reigning champions. The Belchers win game after game, to Chuck's dismay, but receive only a 5-gallon bucket of \\"Fracas Foam\\" (an orange slimy substance dumped onto the losing family) after each victory due to Louise's spinning of the prize wheel. Jimmy and his family challenge and defeat them, winning the minivan, and the Belchers return home. Watching a viral video of the final round, Bob becomes convinced that Chuck rigged it in Jimmy's favor and confronts Harry, the producer of Family Fracas. Harry arranges for the Belchers to sue Jimmy and Chuck on Pam's Court, a court show presided over by Chuck's bitter ex-wife Pam. Bob has no direct evidence of any cheating until Gene realizes that an overhead camera in the Family Fracas studio may have recorded it. Pam orders Chuck to bring in the videotape from that camera, but he destroys it instead. Without any evidence to support Bob's claims, Pam is forced to rule in favor of Jimmy and Chuck. As the Belchers walk home from the studio, they find Jimmy trying in vain to change a flat tire on his new minivan. Bob decides to help, despite mockery from both Jimmy and the rest of the Belchers. Reception Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B‚Äì, saying \\"The inability for the Belchers to make progress renders ‚ÄúFamily Fracas‚Äù relatively disappointing overall. Although it certainly has its funny moments, they don't coalesce into a full episode because the failures become so predictable. The Belchers may deserve fame, and fame could even be good for them in their world, but it's best for us viewers in our world that they stay unrecognized in theirs.\\" The episode received a 1.6 rating and was watched by a total of 3.45 million people.

Career   Parliamentary Secretary  In 1996, Dalli was elected to the Parliament of Malta and appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Women's Rights in the Office of the Prime Minister. She was re-elected during the five subsequent elections, making her the second most elected woman in Maltese political history. During her two-year tenure, she put forwards a Childcare Bill to provide for regulations of childcare services both in the public and the private sector, and took care of the drafting of the Gender Equality Bill with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme. Dalli also launched Malta's first white paper on domestic violence.  Minister  During the 2013-2017 legislature, Dr Dalli was Minister for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties. Under her direction, the Maltese Government introduced several laws and policies to strengthen the equality and human rights framework, including a Civil Unions Act as well as the widening of the anti-discrimination protections in the Maltese constitution to cover the grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation. In April 2015, she presented a law establishing wide-ranging rights for transgender and intersex people. The Gender Identity Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act provides for a right to gender identity and the recognition of one's self- determined gender on official documents, and recognises a right to bodily integrity and physical autonomy. During the same legislature, Dalli introduced a national maternity leave fund to which all employers contribute regardless of the gender of their employees, in order to protect women against discrimination during the recruitment process. Dalli submitting Malta's instrument of accession to OP-CEDAW at the UN Headquarters in March 2019 In 2015, Helena Dalli led the process for the establishment of the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, which the UN now commemorates annually on 11 February. Dalli was also instrumental for the restructuring of the Malta Medicines Authority. Dalli was re-elected from two districts in the 2017 general election. At the start of the new session, she presented to Parliament a Bill to introduce marriage equality (same-sex marriage). Dalli's work in the equality sector led Malta to become the country affording the best legal protection and equality for LGBTIQ people. As a result, Malta has retained the top spot of the ILGA-Europe country index for four consecutive years. Call for a European Commission follow-up to the LGBTI List of Actions (December 2018) During both terms as a Minister, Dalli worked to enhance Malta's human rights and equality structures and their independence, as well as dialogue with civil society and social partners. In view of this, she set up a Human Rights and Equality Directorate that is responsible for Government policy on gender equality and gender mainstreaming, LGBTIQ equality, and migrant integration and anti-racism. She also set up an LGBTIQ Consultative Council, a Consultative Council for Women's Rights and a Forum on Integration Affairs. Following a long and multi-step consultation process, she presented an Equality Bill and a Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill that aim to instil the highest standards in terms of anti-discrimination and equality in all spheres of life, and the setting up of an independent national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles of the United Nations and European Union equality directives. Following the 2019 European elections, Dalli was nominated by the government of Prime Minister Muscat as Malta's candidate for the subsequent European Commission.  Academia  Dalli holds a PhD in Political Sociology from the University of Nottingham, and lectures in Economic and Political Sociology, Public Policy, and Sociology of Law at the University of Malta.  Recognition  In 2016, Dalli was the first Maltese nominee and winner of the European Diversity Award for her work in human rights and equality at the local and international level. In 2019, Dalli was presented, on behalf of Malta, with the Diversa Internacional award by the Spanish Association of Lawyers and Lawyers against Hate Crimes, in recognition of her work for equality on both the domestic and international fronts.

He served as Minister for Energy and the Conservation of Water between 2013 and 2014, Minister for Energy and Health from 2014 until 2016, and as a Minister within the Office of the Prime Minister in April 2016. Mizzi was re-elected on 3 June 2017 by four times as many votes as the 2013 election. He was then appointed by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to serve as the Minister for Tourism, officially since 9 June. Mizzi resigned from the role of Minister for Tourism on 26 November 2019.  Early life   Education and family  Mizzi was educated at the De La Salle College and completed his sixth form at the Paolino Vassallo Upper Lyceum. He graduated at the University of Malta, reading for Undergraduate degree, and then furthered his education with a post-graduate studies at the University of Nottingham, where he achieved his Masters in Strategic Management. He furthered his education with a Doctorate at the University of Nottingham. Mizzi was awarded a Chevening Scholarship from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the United Kingdom and holds a Diploma in Finance.  Career before joining politics  Mizzi has led major projects and initiatives across different sectors including public, infrastructure, telecommunications and enterprise promotion. Mizzi was a Partner and Head of the Energy and Infrastructure Practice for the EMEA Region (Europe, Middle East and Africa) with Pcubed, a global leader in programme management. He has previously held senior roles with Deloitte and Touche and British Telecom (ProGramme DIrector) in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom Mizzi led various change projects which included the forging of an Alliance between seven energy companies which improved services and realised large savings. He worked with Regional Government leaders of which aim was to improve deprived areas. He was a member of a team which established the Malta Enterprise. He was a consultant to the Office of the Prime Minister where he led a number of projects which, included the first public-private partnership to improve landscaping of the main roads in Malta. Mizzi held the post of Chief Information Officer at Enemalta at the age of 26.  Politics  Mizzi was elected in the Maltese Parliament from the Fourth District (Paola, Gudja, Ghaxaq, Tarxien, Santa Lucija and parts of Marsa and Fgura) in March 2013. He was re-elected in the 2017 election from the same district.  2013 general election  Mizzi was appointed by the President, on advice of the Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, as Minister for Energy and the Conservation of Water on 13 March 2013 following the 2013 general elections. On 1 April 2014, Mizzi was given the responsibility for the Health and Energy portfolio. On 28 April 2016, his position was changed to Minister within the Office of the Prime Minister. This gave him the responsibility to carry out high-profile projects.  2017 general election  After the 2017 election, Mizzi was then appointed Minister for Tourism. Immediately in his new role, he has set out an ambitious business and growth strategy for Air Malta, which builds on its current strengths including punctuality and good service. In view of this, Air Malta operates regular flights and will continue to increase their frequency to the region's key airports. One of the clear examples of decisions taken by the new Air Malta board appointed by Minister Konrad Mizzi, was the immediate re-introduction of the Frankfurt route. The Minister made it also clear that Air Malta will be introducing new routes, and announced an increase in its fleet as part of the new commercial strategy being adopted. The Minister together with Air Malta will in the coming months negotiate collective agreements, which will provide the airline with more flexibility that is required for growth and will also be fair to its employees.  Minister for Energy and Health   Energy  = Electricity tariffs = Upon assuming office, as the Minister for Energy, Mizzi started implementing the Government‚Äôs energy plan with the primary aim of reducing utility tariffs. Following this implementation the government is calculated to have injected about ‚Ç¨80 million in the national economy. Previously utility tariffs in Malta were considered amongst the highest tariffs in Europe, and following the reductions utility tariffs become the fourth cheapest in the European Union. This measure enabled the local industry to become more competitive. This saw the transformation of the energy in Malta, contrasting with the situation when Mizzi was given the responsibility when Enemalta was close to declare bankruptcy, with ‚Ç¨840 million in debt and was consecutively downgraded by Standard & Poor‚Äôs. This affecting the credit ratings of the country at the time. = Enemalta = The Power & Gas project being developed in Malta In December 2014 Shanghai Electric signed an agreement with the Government of Malta where it acquired a minority stake in the local energy producer Enemalta. The acquisition was valued at ‚Ç¨250 million. The restructuring envisaged new investment in the local distribution system, as well as transition from oil-fired energy generation to cleaner technology, such as the Malta-Sicily interconnector, gas-fired plants and renewable energy sources. This is expected to increase the grid redundancy and flexibility. The Government of Malta retained the majority of share of the energy company. Shanghai Electric is expected to be investing in the conversion to gas of an existing power plant which at present is powered by heavy fuel oil, valued at around ‚Ç¨70million. In 2016, and following the investment by Shanghai Electric and the restructuring process that followed, Standard and Poor's upgraded Enemalta's rating to BB- with a stable outlook. Enemalta and Shanghai Electric established a joint venture to tap into renewable energy markets in Europe. They are jointly responsible for the development of the Mozura Wind Park project in Montenegro. = Marsa power plant = Change in CO2 emissions, 2015/2014 ‚Äì Source: Eurostat The third pillar of the energy plan will also result in the closure of the Marsa power plant which has been operating since 1969. The Marsa power plant has been shut down, on cold standby, pending the completion of the new gas fired power plant. The local Opposition party criticised the Government of Malta that this plant has been shut down due to measures implemented by the previous Government and not due to the current Government‚Äôs plans. However, the current Government‚Äôs plan envisages the demolition of the 1992 Delimara Phase 1 Heavy Fuel Oil power plant. Demolishing the 1992 power plant, would be impossible to achieve without a new power plant due to N-1 requirements.REGULATION (EU) No 994/2010 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 October 2010 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply and repealing Council Directive 2004/67/EC Over 700,000 tonnes CO2 were reduced by shutting down the Marsa power plant. Statistics from the Eurostat confirmed that Malta experienced the highest reduction in emissions in all the European Union. = Gas power plant and LNG facilities = The second pillar that would be sustaining cheaper utility tariffs in the long-term was the development of a gas fired power plant. The development of this project is based on a private-public partnerships model. The Delimara Power and Gas project is being developed by Electrogas Malta Limited, a consortium that includes SOCAR, Siemens and Gem Holdings. The consortium has been restructured following Gasol departure. Enemalta would be purchasing electricity. The local Opposition Party has been critical of this project since its details were announced, including the procurement process. However, following parliamentary questions in the European Parliament by Malta‚Äôs European People‚Äôs Party, the European Commission stated that there were no procurement violations. Electrogas Malta Limited has recently won the award for Best European Energy Project which is organised by IJ Global. The project is expected to contribute greatly to the decrease in particulate matter by 90%. Through the Delimara Power and Gas project, Malta will be conforming for the first time, with the N-1 principle which is stipulated by European Union directives. Such concept enabled Malta to shift its financial resources onto other sectors, while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of modern and efficient infrastructure. The development of the gas fired power plant and the conversion to gas of another power plant is in line with the European Union Energy policy of the European Union, that encourages the shift to gas in the energy sector. Mizzi is also responsible for Projects Malta, the company tasked with overseeing private-public partnership initiative across a whole spectrum of economic sectors including tourism and other infrastructure projects. The Gas power plant was officially opened in April 2017. The new power station was inaugurated minutes after the 25-year-old Delimara I power station was switched off. The old power station chimney, a 150 m structure in Malta will be demolished in the coming months.  Health  On assuming the health portfolio in 2014, Mizzi embarked a transformation of the health sector by attracting a private investment worth ‚Ç¨200 million to a public-private partnership initiative. This investment was presented as a development of a new world-class hospital on the island of Gozo, with the former St. Luke's Hospital being converted into a new rehabilitation hospital. Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry will manage a new medical school as part of this project.Government's agreement with Barts a 'memorandum of understanding' Vitals Global Healthcare (VGH) was selected as the preferred bidder for the ‚Ç¨200 million investment into St Luke's Hospital, the Karin Grech Rehabilitation Hospital and Gozo General Hospital. Vitals Global has also teamed up with Partners Healthcare as part of this project. Mizzi also worked on several other initiatives, which include out of stock medicines, the emergency department and waiting lists. In 2015, there were no out of stock medicines registered in Malta under the Pharmacy of Your Choice schemehttp://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/60298/no_outofstock_medicine_health_minister_announces#.Wm8juLaZMlU  Minister for Tourism  Mizzi was appointed Minister for Tourism on 8 June 2017 following the 2017 General Election. Apart from Tourism entities and Air Malta, Public Private Partnerships and external transport were included in his portfolio.  Air Malta  Shortly upon assuming office, Mizzi claimed his priority over the next 12 months is to restructure the national airline and ensure it becomes financially viable before a strategic partner is roped in. On 12 July 2017, Mizzi appointed a new board of directors, with Dr Charles Mangion being the new chairman. Mizzi claimed that he would be working hand in hand with the new board of directors on the next phase of the Air Malta transformation.\\" Since Mizzi took over responsibility of Air Malta, the airline re-opened its Tunis and Frankfurt routes. The airline later made announcements on several other new routes, namely Manchester, Casablanca, Lisbon, St Petersburg, Kiev and Venice. Air Malta announced two additions to its fleet, by increasing to a total of 10 aircraft. On 19 June 2018, Air Malta received its first Airbus A320 Neo, branded in Nickelodeon special livery. Mizzi has claimed that Air Malta can be a niche carrier based in Malta to help passengers connect between Europe and North Africa. On 10 September 2017, Ryanair announced its intentions of collaborating with Air Malta to start selling Air Malta flights on its online platform, and to collaborate on flight connections. In January, Mizzi announced that a new government-owned company by the name of Malta Air Travel Ltd with a capital value of ‚Ç¨70 million has been set and will be taking over the landing rights that Air Malta uses in some of the biggest airports around Europe. The new company will be leasing the landing slots Air Malta used in airports like Heathrow back to the national airline for its exclusive use.  Malta Tourism Authority  In order to handle enforcement, Mizzi has claimed that a 'multi agency team' will be introduced to ensure that there is better coordination and regulation of beaches before new concessions are granted. This will cover key stake holders such as the Malta Tourism Authority, Transport Malta, and the Lands department. One of the first initiatives taken by Mizzi was a plan to appoint town managers within the Malta Foundation for Tourism Zones. Paceville, which is a main touristic area in Malta, will be the first to have a designated town manager. These town managers will have their primary responsibility to maintain tourism areas and flag any possible irregularities.  Route development  Mizzi worked on several new routes to and from Malta with different airlines. Apart from the increase in Air Malta flights, Mizzi announced new flights with Easyjet, and a pack of 12-new flights with Ryanair, following an investment of more than 100,000 Euro in a new aircraft based in Malta. These are additional from the new flights and routes announced by Air Malta which has increased 21 new routes as of September 2018.  Malta Air  Mizzi spearheaded negotiations related to Malta Air with low-cost airline giant Ryanair. Via an agreement with Government, Ryanair would invest around ‚Ç¨1 billion which includes 6 Boeing 737 aircraft, and their operations into Malta. A group of around 60 cabin crew and pilots who work for Ryanair subsidiary Malta Air were be made redundant in June 2020.  Controversies   Panama Papers  Mizzi was named in the Panama Papers in April 2016. It was revealed that Mizzi had acquired a Panamanian company called Hearnville Incorporated. Its shareholder, Orion Trust Limited, was established in New Zealand through a Maltese financial services company. The trust was purchased for Mizzi through law firm Mossack Fonseca. Criticism from the Maltese opposition party, and the general population was expressed and a motion of no- confidence was put forward. The motion was defeated and all Government Members of Parliament voted against this motion. Mizzi was nevertheless criticised by a number of high-level Labour Party figures. Mizzi had publicly disclosed his structure in his declaration of assets. Mizzi said that the fund was solely intended to protect his family's assets, which include property in Malta and in London. Mizzi laid out the details of the trust and the company to the Maltese Parliament in February 2016. Mizzi had declared in March 2016 that Hearnville Inc was a shell company which held no assets. Mizzi requested that the Commissioner for Revenue and an international tax audit firm to carry out a tax audit on his assets. Since the audit is complete, he closed down Hearnville Incorporated. Mizzi insisted that the financial structure he set up was not illegal and he did not attempt to hide it from the public.

He was first elected to Parliament in 2004, and re- elected in the 2008, 2013 and 2017 elections from the sixth district which comprises his hometown, Qormi, together with Luqa and Siggiewi.  Initial years: Qormi Local Council  Galdes was active in the Labour Party from a young age, forming part of Labour's Youth Forum National Executive together with Joseph Muscat, who years later became Party Leader and Prime Minister of Malta. In 1994, Galdes successfully contested the first local council elections in Qormi, becoming the youngest councillor at the time. In 2001, he became the first Labour mayor of the locality. In 2004 Galdes was re-elected with the highest number of votes polled by a Labour Party candidate nationwide in the 2004 Local Council elections, garnering 3,513 first-count votes. Thanks to this performance, Labour won a seat from the Nationalist Party. During his tenure as Qormi Mayor (2001‚Äì2004), Galdes is best remembered for the vast infrastructural projects undertaken throughout the locality, including resurfacing of the road network.  Member of Parliament  2004 General Election At the age of 29, Galdes became a Member of Parliament, replacing long-serving MP John Attard Montalto who was elected to serve as an MEP in Brussels. Upon taking the oath of office, then Labour leader Alfred Sant gave Galdes the responsibility to shadow the Environment and National Heritage ministry. 2008 General Election Galdes successfully contested the 2008 General Elections garnering 1,634 first count votes, reported by the Times of Malta as \\"a massive increase on the 359 votes of five years ago, when he was elected for the first time.\\" For the 2008-2013 legislature, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Planning, Housing, Urban Development and Construction in 2008. He was also the official Labour Representative on the Malta Environment and Planning Authority board. 2013 General Election Roderick Galdes continued to establish himself as a Labour figure in the sixth district in the 2013 general election when he increased his tally vote to more than 2,000 first count votes. Consequently, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat appointed him as Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Animal Rights under the Ministry of Environment. 2017 General Election Parliamentary Secretary for Social Accommodation Roderick Galdes On 1 May, Prime Minister Muscat called a snap election for the following 3 June. In this election, Roderick Galdes contested the sixth district, comprising Qormi, Luqa and Siggiewi. He was elected for the fourth consecutive time, with 2,757 first count votes. This also meant an increase of more than 700 votes when compared to the previous election. Prime Minister Muscat entrusted him with the portfolio of Social Accommodation, which Muscat had earlier described as ‚Äúone of the most important priorities in the upcoming legislature‚Äù.  Reforms in Agriculture, Fisheries & Animal Welfare (2013-2017)  Roderick Galdes, 2016 As the first Labour politician responsible for Agriculture in 15 years, Galdes set out to modernise the sector with today's reality. Under his watch, a new fish market was completed in line with the highest EU standards, replacing the old fisheries building which was built in 1911. Ports and facilities used by fishermen were also upgraded through an investment of more than ‚Ç¨5.5 million. This included a 90-year old wharf at Tal-Veƒãƒãja in St Paul's Bay, after it was left deteriorating with no suitable maintenance for years. Galdes also managed to overturn Malta's abattoir fortunes. While in 2013 the abattoir was on the verge of closing, due to EU Commission's infringement procedures related to bad practices and infrastructural deficiencies, in 2016 it was cleared by the European Commission following a reform overseen by Galdes. Under Galdes, Malta enacted its first National Agricultural Policy, inaugurated a new botanic garden ƒ†nien il-Pjanti Maltin to safeguard and conserve Maltese trees and plants, launched the first Animal Welfare Fund to assist NGOs and sanctuaries and initiated upgrades at the Pitkalija market. A new animal hospital was also inaugurated offering services and operations for the first time in Malta.  Social Housing & Rent reform (2017-  Malta Parliamentary Secretary for Social Accommodation Roderick GaldesTaking office as junior Minister for Social Housing, Galdes immediately launched a number of initiatives related to the sector. These included a rental scheme of private properties 'Nikru biex Nassistu', a regeneration scheme of vacant properties, the launching of an affordable loan scheme for low-income earners, and an anti-housing fraud freephone. An ongoing project is the building of 680 housing units, in 16 sites, earmarked for affordable accommodation. On 15 October 2018, Galdes published a detailed White Paper on rent reform, encouraging longer leases, regulating rental increases, without imposing any fixed prices. The proposed rent reform was lauded by Employers, a coalition of 20 Social NGOs, Caritas, Developers, Architects, Trade-Unions, and CEOs of Gaming companies among others.

It was the result of a court-order in response to shortfalls in medical and mental health care for the state's prison population. Local police blamed the 2019 California stabbing rampage on Assembly Bill 109, which was later named the Public Safety Realignment initiative. On 23 May 2011 the US Supreme Court upheld an order by a three- judge federal court requiring the state of California to reduce its state prison population to no more than 137.5% of its design capacity within two years. Prior to the initiative the state's prison population had risen to roughly 180% of its design capacity, and prisoners had become unable to receive routine medical or mental health care. In response, the governor and the state legislature passed two bills, Assembly Bill 109 and Assembly Bill 117, which became law and went into effect on 1 October 2011. Under these laws, new non-violent, non-serious, and non-sexual offenders with sentences of longer than one year would be housed in county jail facilities rather than state prisons (existing prisoners falling in those categories would not be relocated). Also, inmates released from such facilities would be placed on county-directed supervision rather than state parole. The laws also provided new funding for county facilities for the management of this increased in population. By 2014 the state had offloaded approximately 25,000 prisoners to county facilities, but was still 9,600 prisoners short of the requirements set by the federal court. The court then granted the state two more years to meet its target prison population. However, the overall inmate population in the state had grown by approximately 12% since the original court order was upheld.  Before realignment  As of 2011, California's state prisons were designed to house approximately 85,000 inmates. At that time, the Prison system housed nearly twice that many, approximately 156,000 inmates. The prison population consisted mainly of men (93%), Latinos and African Americans (roughly 67%), the majority from large urban centers (60% from Los Angeles), and were either unemployed or members of the working poor. Before the 1970s, imprisonment in the United States was rare: only 0.1% of the population was classified as incarcerated on any given day. Forty years later, approximately 1 in every 31 Americans was either in jail/ prison, or on probation/ parole. The financial cost has been estimated at over $60 billion a year for prisons alone, and when factoring in the cost of police and courts the figure has been identified as closer to $215 billion.  Brown v. Plata  In 2011, the US Supreme Court ruled on the case of Brown v. Plata, a case on prison overcrowding. The Supreme Court held in a 5:4 decision that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation had violated inmates' Eighth Amendment rights protecting them from cruel and unusual punishment. The Court upheld a lower court's three-judge panel's order to decrease the population of California's prisons from approximately 156,000 inmates to 110,000 inmates. In addition, they determined that overcrowding was the cause of inmates' inadequate medical and mental health care. As a result, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation had to redistribute inmates and parolees to decrease the overall population to the mandated levels.  The Public Safety Realignment Act  To abide by the federal court's order, California legislature passed Assembly Bill 109 in April 2011. The resulting Public Safety Realignment Act changed how the California state government deals with low level felonies, with the goal of reduced recidivism. Effective October 1, 2011, certain felonies would carry a condition of imprisonment in county jails, as opposed to state prisons. In general, the crimes that qualified for jail sentences, labeled N-3, are non-violent, non-serious, and do not require the accused to register as a sex offender. Parole violations would also be served in local jails. The act also funded post-release community supervision, shifting responsibility for N-3 criminals to the local level. Each county created a Community Corrections Partnership to oversee the implementation of realignment. However, all inmates in state prison at the time the act was made effective would continue to serve their full sentences in prison. The act did not affect the conditions of incarceration. Inmates in county jail were eligible to receive four days of good credit for every two days served, as long as the crime was committed after the act came into effect.  Consequences  According to the Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice, the first eight months of realignment saw a 41% reduction in new prison admissions and a drop of 28,300 inmates. The parole population was reduced by about half as well. After 15 months, approximately 24,000 inmates that would have served time in state prison were moved to county jails. 14,000 of them were parole violators, and 10,000 were newly sentenced inmates. To accommodate the influx of new inmates, $400 million was provided to the counties in 2011-2012, growing to more than $850 million in 2012-2013 and more than $1 billion in 2013-2014. In April 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown asked for the federal court to rescind its order, citing much improved prison healthcare and a noticeably reduced prison population. The court rejected Gov. Brown's challenge, prompting his declaration in May 2013 that the state would be unable to fully meet the court's order. He instead proposed a series of measures with the goal of being within 2,570 inmates of the required 137.5% maximum capacity, which include sending more inmates to firefighting camp, housing state inmates out of state, medical parole, and leasing private prisons. No changes to sentencing were mentioned.  Criticisms  Some praise realignment as a shift away from California's policy of mass incarceration, such as the three-strikes law. However, many opponents of the law argue that the underlying cause of mass incarceration is unaffected. Californians United for a Responsible Budget (CURB) has stated \\"The only sustainable way to end overcrowding is to reduce the number of people imprisoned in California.\\" Ken Strutin of the New York State Defenders Association believes that there is a fundamental problem in the way criminals are sentenced, as sentences are often inflated to maintain a \\"tough on crime\\" image. Professor Peter Nardulli of the University of Illinois frames this in another way: \\"Rehabilitation no longer seems to be the panacea for crime.\\" A visible effect is that certain county jails are now in danger of overcrowding. Along these lines, CURB has suggested decriminalizing drug possession, reducing sentences for youth, and preventing excessive sentences. As an alternative, Professor Schuck of Yale University has proposed deportation of inmates who are present illegally in the US, writing \\"Early deportation of immigrant criminals would confer immense benefits on federal and state taxpayers (and on the remaining prisoners) at little or no marginal costs.\\"  References  Category:Penal system in California ","title":"Public Safety Realignment initiative"},{"id":"39120626","text":"The Icehouse Historic District is a historic district in Selma, Dallas County, Alabama.

In 1957 the Testing Centre for Military Aerial Equipment (Erprobungsstelle f√ºr milit√§risches Luftger√§t) was founded, the predecessor of the Bundeswehr Technical and Airworthiness Center for Aircraft. The centre was based at Oberpfaffenhofen Airfield. Initially, the tasks of this new centre were to create the structure and procedures for the testing centre. Once this was completed, the centre was operational and began the testing and evaluation procedure of aerial military equipment selected for possible procurement by the German Armed Forces. Parts of the testing centre were relocated to Manching Air Base in 1967. The fact that Manching Air Base was also used by Reconnaissance Wing 51 at that time, restricted the testing of new aircraft. Consequently, in 1968, a new airfield was selected, Giebelstadt Airport, to house the units previously based at Manching Air Base. In 1969, all units of the testing centre were concentrated at Manching Air Base. In 1987, the centre was renamed Wehrtechnische Dienststelle f√ºr Luftfahrzeuge ‚Äì Musterpr√ºfwesen f√ºr Luftfahrtger√§t der Bundeswehr (Wehrtechnische Dienstelle 61 (WTD 61)).B.

It existed under several variations of the 225th Brigade title. World War I On the outbreak of World War I the Territorial Force (TF) immediately mobilised for home defence, but shortly afterwards (31 August 1914), its units were authorised to raise 2nd battalions formed from those men who had not volunteered for, or were not fit for, overseas service, together with new volunteers, while the 1st Line went overseas to supplement the Regulars.Becke, p. 6. Early in 1915 the 2nd Line TF battalions were raised to full strength to form new divisions, and began to form Reserve (3rd Line) units to supply drafts.Becke, pp. 6, 65. The remaining Home Service men were separated out in May 1915 to form brigades of Coast Defence Battalions (termed Provisional Battalions from June 1915). 5th Provisional Brigade 5th Provisional Brigade was formed mainly from details of regiments from East and South-East England, with the following composition:5th Provisional Brigade War Diary, The National Archives, Kew file WO 95/5458. * 5th Provisional Yeomanry Squadron from details of 1st and 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigades and Shropshire Yeomanry * 5th Provisional Battery Royal Field Artillery * 5th Provisional Brigade Ammunition Column RFA * 5th Provisional Field Company Royal Engineers * 3/6th (Cyclist) Battalion Norfolk Regiment disbanded March 1916 * 63rd Provisional Battalion from details of 8th Battalion Middlesex Regiment * 65th Provisional Battalion * 68th Provisional Battalion * 69th Provisional Battalion (The Queen's). This battalion was formed on 19 June 1915 at Tunbridge Wells by amalgamating the Home Service men of the 3/4th and 2/5th Battalions of the Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment. After working on coast defences the battalion moved to Lowestoft in July to join 5th Provisional Brigade.69th Provisional Battalion (The Queen's) War Diary, The National Archives file WO 95/5458. * 5th Provisional Field Ambulance from 2/3rd East Anglian and 3/2nd Wessex Field Ambulances Royal Army Medical Corps * 5th Provisional Brigade Train Army Service Corps During the autumn of 1915, 5th Provisional Brigade was stationed in Suffolk, attached to 58th (2/1st London) Division for administration, and to 1/1st Mounted Division for operations. In April 1916 2/1st East Anglian (Essex) Heavy Battery Royal Garrison Artillery joined the brigade and remained with it until the end of the war.Becke, p. 93. By July 1916 the brigade was under the control of Northern Army of Central Force, with its battalions billeted as follows:Distribution of Northern and Southern Armies (Home Defence), The National Archives file WO 33/765. * Brigade Headquarters: St Olaves * 63rd Provisional Bn: Gorleston * 65th Provisional Bn: Great Yarmouth * 68th Provisional Bn: Lowestoft * 69th Provisional Bn: Lowestoft 225th Mixed Brigade The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Brigades thus became anomalous, and at the end of 1916 their units became numbered battalions of their parent units. Part of their role was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. 5th Provisional Brigade became 225th Mixed Brigade in December 1916, with its units redesignated as follows: * 5th Provisional Battery became 1207th Home Counties Battery RFA * 5th Provisional Field Company became 604th Home Counties Field Company RE * 63rd Provisional Battalion became 32nd Battalion, Middlesex Regiment * 65th Provisional Battalion became 15th Battalion, Essex Regiment * 68th Provisional Battalion became 18th Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment * 69th Provisional Battalion, became 19th Battalion, Queen's Regiment * 5th Provisional Brigade Train became 837 Company ASC In May 1918 each of the Mixed Brigades was called upon to provide a battalion (redesignated a Garrison Guard battalion) to reconstitute the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been virtually destroyed during the German Army's Spring Offensive. 225th Mixed Brigade supplied 15th Essex to 177th (2/1st Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade and immediately raised a new 18th (Home Service) Battalion Essex Regiment to take over its coast defence duties.Becke, pp. 20‚Äì21. The brigade remained with this composition until the end of the war, after which it was demobilised. World War II Formation and Service The 225th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) was formed for service in the United Kingdom on 14 November 1940, during World War II. It was commanded by Brigadier J.W. Pendlebury and initially consisted of newly raised infantry battalions from North-West England.Joslen, p. 388. Upon formation the 225th Brigade came under Western Command until 10 February 1941 when it briefly came under command of 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division. On 12 March 1941, the Brigade became part of the newly created Northumberland County Division.Joslen, pp. 115, 388. The Northumberland County Division was broken up on 30 November 1941, when the headquarters of 225th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) was re-designated HQ 35th Army Tank Brigade.Joslen, pp. 208, 388. Its infantry battalions were converted to the armoured role as shown: Order of Battle The composition of 225th Brigade was as follows: * 10th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) (14 November 1940 ‚Äî 30 November 1941, converted that year into the 151st Regiment Royal Armoured Corps)Forty, pp. 50‚Äì1. * 14th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (14 November 1940 ‚Äî 9 February 1941) * 9th Battalion, Border Regiment (14 November 1940 ‚Äî 17 November 1941) * 9th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (14 November 1940 ‚Äî 27 May 1941) * 12th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (28 May ‚Äì 13 November 1941) * 15th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (19 November 1941 ‚Äî 30 November 1941, converted the next year into the 155th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps) * 11th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (19 November 1941 ‚Äî 30 November 1941, converted that year into the 152nd Regiment Royal Armoured Corps) The 225th Brigade number has never been reactivated.

Three days later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released images of two suspects, who were later identified as Chechen Kyrgyzstani-American brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Following the suspects' identification, they killed an MIT policeman, kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby Watertown, during which two officers were severely injured (one of whom died a year later). Tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother Dzhokhar ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after. An unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed. Around 6:00p.m., a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard.\\"Two unnamed officials say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, did not have a gun when he was captured Friday in a Watertown, Mass. backyard. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat.\\" The Associated Press Wednesday, April 24, 2013, 8:42 PM. Dzhokhar was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody. During questioning, Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead. He said they learned to build explosive devices from the online magazine of Al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He also said they had intended to travel to New York City to bomb Times Square. On April 8, 2015, he was convicted of 30 charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death. Two months later, he was sentenced to death, though in July 2020 this sentence was vacated and is to be reheard by a new trial.  Bombing  The blasts (red) occurred along the marathon course (dark blue), the first nearer the finish line than the second. The 117th annual Boston Marathon was run on Patriots' Day, April 15, 2013. At , two bombs detonated about apart at the finish line on Boylston Street near Copley Square. The first exploded outside Marathon Sports at 671‚Äì673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43p.m. At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start at 10:40a.m. The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57p.m., 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 Boylston Street. The explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line, but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish. Windows on adjacent buildings were blown out, but there was no structural damage. Runners continued to cross the line until 2:57p.m.  Casualties and initial response  Rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched, including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state. The explosions killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated at 27 local hospitals. At least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering traumatic amputations as a direct result of the blasts. Police, following emergency plans, diverted arriving runners to Boston Common and Kenmore Square. The nearby Lenox Hotel and other buildings were evacuated. Police closed a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on April 16. Boston police commissioner Edward F. Davis recommended that people stay off the streets. Dropped bags and packages, abandoned as their owners fled from the blasts, increased uncertainty as to the possible presence of more bombs and many false reports were received. An unrelated electrical fire at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in nearby Dorchester was initially feared to be a bomb. Emergency services at work after the bombing The airspace over Boston was restricted, and departures halted from Boston's Logan International Airport. Some local transit service was halted as well. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines. Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators. The American Red Cross helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties. The Boston Police Department also set up a helpline for people concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for people to provide information. Google Person Finder activated their disaster service under Boston Marathon Explosions to log known information about missing people as a publicly viewable file. Due to the closure of several hotels near the blast zone, a number of visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them.  Investigation  This pressure cooker fragment was part of one of the explosive devices. The Federal Bureau of Investigation led the investigation, assisted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. It was initially believed by some that North Korea was behind the attack after escalating tensions and threats with the U.S.http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-blamed-for-boston- bombings-2013-4?IR=Thttp://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-denies-any-link-boston- marathon-bombs-says-it-still-may-strike-us-1211721 United States government officials stated that there had been no intelligence reports suggesting such an attack. Representative Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said: \\"I received two top secret briefings last week on the current threat levels in the United States, and there was no evidence of this at all.\\" After being identified, the father of the two suspects claimed that the FBI had been watching his family. He stated that they visited his sons' home in Cambridge, Massachusetts five times, most recently in 2011, as \\"preventive work... afraid there might be some explosions on the streets of Boston.\\" Emptied fireworks from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's backpack, found in a landfill near the UMass Dartmouth campus Evidence found near the blast sites included bits of metal, nails, ball bearings, black nylon pieces from a backpack, remains of an electronic circuit board, and wiring. A pressure cooker lid was found on a nearby rooftop. Both of the improvised explosive devices were pressure cooker bombs manufactured by the bombers. Authorities confirmed that the brothers used bomb-making instructions found in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine. After the suspects were identified, The Boston Globe reported that Tamerlan purchased fireworks from a fireworks store in New Hampshire. On April 19, the FBI, West New York Police Department, and Hudson County Sheriff's Department seized computer equipment from the apartment of the Tsarnaevs' sister in West New York, New Jersey. On April 24, investigators reported that they had reconstructed the bombs, and believed that they had been triggered by remote controls used for toy cars.  April 18‚Äì19 shootings and manhunt   Release of suspect photos  Jeff Bauman was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: \\"Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me\\". He later gave a detailed description of the suspects, which enabled images of them to be identified and circulated quickly. At 5:20p.m. on April 18, the FBI released images of two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them. The FBI said that they were doing this in part to limit harm to people wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media. As seen on video, the suspects stayed to observe the chaos after the explosions, then walked away casually. The public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public social networks.  MIT shooting and carjacking  Scenes and approximate times of events of April 18‚Äì19 A few hours after the photos were released, the Tsarnaev brothers ambushed and shot Sean A. Collier of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department six times in an attempt to steal his Smith & Wesson M&P45; sidearm, which they could not free from his holster because of its retention system. Collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the Building 32 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. He died soon after. The brothers then carjacked a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood of Boston. Tamerlan took the owner, Chinese national Dun \\"Danny\\" Meng (),Chinese name from: hostage and told him that he was responsible for the Boston bombing and for killing a police officer. Dzhokhar followed them in their green Honda Civic, later joining them in the Mercedes-Benz. Interrogation later revealed that the brothers \\"decided spontaneously\\" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb Times Square. The Tsarnaev brothers forced Meng to use his ATM cards to obtain $800 in cash. They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Civic, for which an all-points bulletin was issued. While the Tsarnaev brothers stopped at a Shell gas station, Meng escaped and ran across the street to the Mobil gas station, asking the clerk to call 911. His cell phone remained in the vehicle, allowing the police to focus their search on Watertown.  Watertown shootout  Shortly after midnight on April 19, Watertown police officer Joseph Reynolds identified the brothers in the Honda and the stolen Mercedes after overhearing radio traffic that the vehicle was \\"pinged\\" by Cambridge officers on Dexter Ave. in Watertown. Reynolds followed the vehicle while waiting for additional units to perform a high-risk traffic stop when the suspect vehicles both turned onto Laurel St. and stopped. Tamerlan Tsarnaev stepped out of his vehicle and immediately opened fire on Officer Reynolds and Sergeant John MacLellan, who both returned fire and requested emergency assistance over their radios. A violent gun battle ensued between Tsarnaev, the aforementioned officers, and subsequent additional police responding to the \\"shots fired\\" radio transmissions from Reynolds and MacLellan in the 100 block of Laurel St. An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired, 56 of which were later determined to have been fired from the suspects, and at least one pressure cooker bomb and several \\"crude grenades\\" were thrown. The agencies involved in the nearly 7-minute long shootout included the Watertown Police Department, Cambridge Police Department, Boston Police Department, Massachusetts State Police (MSP), Boston University Police Department, and MBTA Transit Police Department. The majority of the officers involved in the shootout were equipped by their respective agencies with either the Glock 22 or Glock 23 .40 S&W-caliber; pistols. MSP troopers were armed with Smith & Wesson M&P45; pistols chambered in .45 ACP; this lead investigators to match the 9mm casings and projectiles found at the scene to be matched to the suspects' 9mm Ruger P95 pistol. According to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an \\"arsenal of guns.\\" Tamerlan eventually ran out of ammunition and threw his empty Ruger pistol at Watertown PD Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who subsequently tackled him with assistance from Sergeant MacLellan. Tamerlan's younger brother Dzhokhar then drove the stolen SUV toward Tamerlan and the police, who unsuccessfully tried to drag Tamerlan out of his path; the car ran over Tamerlan and dragged him a short distance down the street, narrowly missing the Watertown officers. Dzhokhar abandoned the car half a mile away and fled on foot. Badly wounded, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was taken into custody, and died at 1:35a.m. at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police Officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. was critically wounded in crossfire from other officers shooting at the fleeing vehicle, but survived. Boston Police Department officer Dennis Simmonds was injured by a hand grenade and died on April 10, 2014. Fifteen other officers were also injured. A later report by Harvard Kennedy School's Program on Crisis Leadership concluded that lack of coordination among police agencies had put the public at excessive risk during the shootout. Only one firearm was recovered at the scene, Tsarnaev's Ruger P95, which was found to have a defaced serial number.  Identification and search for suspects  Records on the Honda left at the scene identified the men as two brothers whose family had immigrated to the United States seeking political asylum around 2002: 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev and 19-year-old Dzhokhar \\"Jahar\\" Tsarnaev. The FBI released additional photos of the two during the Watertown incident. Early on April 19, Watertown residents received automated calls asking them to stay indoors. That same morning Governor Patrick asked residents of Watertown and adjacent cities and townsBoston, Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Newton, and Waltham to \\"shelter in place\\". Somerville residents also received automated calls instructing them to shelter in place. A 20-block area of Watertown was cordoned off and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door, as officers scoured the area in tactical gear. Helicopters circled the area and SWAT teams in armored vehicles moved through in formation, with officers going door to door. On the scene were the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Diplomatic Security Service, HSI-ICE, the National Guard, the Boston, Cambridge, Watertown Police departments, and the Massachusetts State Police. The show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The entire public transit network and most Boston taxi services were suspended, as was Amtrak service to and from Boston. Logan International Airport remained open under heightened security. Universities, schools, many businesses, and other facilities were closed as thousands of law enforcement personnel participated in the door-to-door manhunt in Watertown. Others followed up on other leads, including searching the house that the brothers shared in Cambridge, where seven improvised explosive devices were found. The brothers' father spoke from his home in Makhachkala, Dagestan, encouraging Dzhokhar to: \\"Give up. You have a bright future ahead of you. Come home to Russia.\\" He continued, \\"If they killed him, then all hell would break loose.\\" On television, Dzhokhar's uncle from Montgomery Village, Maryland pleaded with him to turn himself in. Mission Hill neighborhood On the evening of April 19, two hours after the shelter-in- place order had been lifted, David Henneberry, a Watertown resident outside the search area, noticed that the tarp was loose on his parked boat. Investigating, he saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood. He contacted the authorities, who surrounded the boat. A police helicopter verified movement through a thermal imaging device. The figure inside started poking at the tarp, promoting police to shoot at the boat. According to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis and Watertown Police Chief Deveau, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shooting at police from inside the boat, \\"exchanging fire for an hour\\". A subsequent report indicated that the firing lasted for a shorter time. Despite this, the suspect was found to have no weapon when he was captured. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested at 8:42p.m. and taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand. Initial reports that the neck wound represented a suicide attempt were contradicted by him being unarmed. The situation was chaotic, according to a police source quoted by The Washington Post, and the firing of weapons occurred during \\"the fog of war\\". A subsequent review by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provided this more specific summary: \\"One officer fired his weapon without appropriate authority in response to perceived movement in the boat, and surrounding officers followed suit in a round of 'contagious fire', assuming they were being fired on by the suspect. Weapons continued to be fired for several seconds until on scene supervisors ordered a ceasefire and regained control of the scene. The unauthorized shots created another dangerous crossfire situation\\". These confusions were caused in part by a lack of clearly identified and coordinated law enforcement command of the thousands of officers from surrounding communities who self-deployed into the Watertown area during the events.  Legal proceedings   Interrogation  United States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel. Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and would jeopardize the prosecution. The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant. Dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a Miranda warning. Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's public safety exception. This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.  Charges and detention  thumb On April 22, 2013, formal criminal charges were brought against Tsarnaev in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized. He was charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death. Some of the charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty. Tsarnaev was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding. The judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney and he said no; he was represented by the Federal Public Defender's office. On April 26, Dzhohkar Tsarnaev was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, about from Boston. FMC Devens is a federal prison medical facility at a former Army base where he was held in solitary confinement at a segregated housing unit with 23-hour-per-day lockdown. On July 10, 2013, Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 charges in his first public court appearance, including a murder charge for MIT police officer Sean Collier. He was back in court for a status hearing on September 23,\\"Court papers say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had fractured skull, hand after manhunt\\" by Laurel J. Sweet, The Boston Herald. and his lawyers requested more time to prepare their defense. On October 2, Tsarnaev's attorneys asked the court to lift the special administrative measures (SAMs) imposed by Attorney General Holder in August, saying that the measures had left Tsarnaev unduly isolated from communication with his family and lawyers, and that no evidence suggested that he posed a future threat.  Trial and sentencing  Jury selection began on January 5, 2015, and was completed on March 3, with a jury consisting of eight men and ten women (including six alternates). The trial began on March 4 with Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb describing the bombing and painting Dzhokhar as \\"a soldier in a holy war against Americans\\" whose motive was \\"reaching paradise\\". He called the brothers equal participants. Defense attorney Judy Clarke admitted that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had placed the second bomb and was present at the murder of Sean Collier, the carjacking of Dun Meng, and the Watertown shootout, but she emphasized the influence that his older brother had on him, portraying him as a follower. Between March 4 and 30, prosecutors called more than 90 witnesses, including bombing survivors who described losing limbs in the attack, and the government rested its case on March 30. The defense rested as well on March 31, after calling four witnesses. Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 counts on April 8. The sentencing phase of the trial began on April 21, and a further verdict was reached on May 15 in which it was recommended that he be put to death. Tsarnaev was sentenced to death on June 24, after apologizing to the victims. In 2018 Tsarnaev's lawyers appealed on the grounds that a lower-court judge's refusal to move the case to another city not traumatized by the bombings deprived him of a fair trial. On July 30, 2020, Tsarnaev's death sentence was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which found that the District Court did not properly screen jurors on how much they had heard of the case during jury selection. The First Circuit vacated the death sentence and three of the other thirty convictions against Tsarnaev, and ordered a new penalty phase jury trial with fresh jurors, leaving the decision of a new change of venue to the District Court. Tsarnaev's remaining convictions still carried multiple life sentences, assuring that he would remain in prison regardless of the results of the new trial.  Motives and backgrounds of the Tsarnaev brothers   Motives  According to FBI interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by Islamic beliefs but \\"were not connected to any known terrorist groups\\", instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen. They further alleged that \\"Dzhokhar and his brother considered suicide attacks and striking [the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular] on the Fourth of July\\"; but ultimately decided to use remotely- activated pressure cooker bombs and other IEDs. Fox News reported that the brothers \\"chose the prestigious race as a 'target of opportunity' ... [after] the building of the bombs came together more quickly than expected\\". Dzhokhar said that he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S., accusing the U.S. of conducting the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan against Muslims. A CBS report revealed that Dzhokhar had scrawled a note with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding; the note stated that the bombings were \\"retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq\\", and called the Boston victims \\"collateral damage\\", \\"in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world.\\" Photographs of the note were later used in the trial. Some political science and public policy writers suggest that Islam may have played a secondary role in the attacks. These writers theorize that the primary motives might have been sympathy towards the political aspirations in the Caucasus region and Tamerlan's inability to become fully integrated into American society. According to the Los Angeles Times, a law enforcement official said that Dzhokhar \\"did not seem as bothered about America's role in the Muslim world\\" as his brother Tamerlan had been. Dzhokhar identified Tamerlan as the \\"driving force\\" behind the bombing, and said that his brother had only recently recruited him to help. Some journalists and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense attorney have suggested that the FBI may have recruited or attempted to recruit Tamerlan Tsarnaev as an informant.  Backgrounds  An apartment was searched in West New York, New Jersey that belonged to a sister of the Tsarnaevs. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was born in 1986 in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, North Caucasus. Dzhokhar was born in 1993 in Kazakhstan, although some reports say that his family claims that he was born in Dagestan. The family spent time in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and in Makhachkala, Dagestan. They are half Chechen through their father Anzor, and half Avar through their mother Zubeidat. They never lived in Chechnya, yet the brothers identified themselves as Chechen. The Tsarnaev family immigrated to the United States in 2002 where they applied for political asylum, settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended Bunker Hill Community College but dropped out to become a boxer. His goal was to gain a place on the U.S. Olympic boxing team, saying that, \\"unless his native Chechnya becomes independent\\", he would \\"rather compete for the United States than for Russia\\". He married U.S. citizen Katherine Russell on July 15, 2010, in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque. While initially quoted in a student magazine as saying, \\"I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them,\\" a later FBI interview report documents Tamerlan stating it was a misquote, and that most of his friends were American. He had a history of violence, including an arrest in July 2009 for assaulting his girlfriend. The brothers were Muslim; Tamerlan's aunt stated that he had recently become a devout Muslim. Tamerlan became more devout and religious after 2009, and a YouTube channel in his name linked to Salafist and Islamist videos. The FBI was informed by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in 2011 that he was a \\"follower of radical Islam.\\" In response, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan and his family and searched databases, but they did not find any evidence of \\"terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.\\" During the 2012 trip to Dagestan, Tamerlan was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on Kotrova Street in Makhachkala, believed by the FSB to be linked with radical Islam. Some believe that \\"they were motivated by their faith, apparently an anti-American, radical version of Islam\\" acquired in the U.S., while others believe that the turn happened in Dagestan. At the time of the bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth with a major in marine biology. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012. Tamerlan's boxing coach reported to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by Tamerlan and admired him. Tamerlan was previously connected to the triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, on the evening of September 11, 2011, but he was not a suspect at the time. Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess's apartment. All had their throats slit from ear to ear with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random. Tamerlan Tsarnaev had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his \\"best friend.\\" After the bombing and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect. Both ABC and The New York Times have reported that there is strong evidence which implicates Tsarnaev in this triple homicide. Some analysts claim that the Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad who influenced her sons' behavior. This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S. government on two occasions about the family's behavior. Both Tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list about 18 months before the bombing took place.  Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions   People detained and released  On April 15, several people who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the bombing, including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable. Law enforcement searched his residence in a Boston suburb, and the man was found to have no connection to the attack. An unnamed U.S. official said, \\"he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.\\" On the night of April 18, two men who were riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined that they were not involved in the Marathon attacks. Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to strip naked by police who feared that he might have concealed explosives. He was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander.  Ibragim Todashev  On May 22, the FBI interrogated Ibragim Todashev in Orlando, Florida, who was a Chechen from Boston. During the interrogation, he was shot and killed by an FBI agent who claimed that Todashev attacked him. The New York Times quoted an unnamed law enforcement official as saying that Todashev had confessed to a triple homicide, and had implicated Tsarnaev as well. Todashev's father claimed his son is innocent and that federal investigators are biased against Chechens and made up their case against him.  Dias Kadyrbayev, Azamat Tazhayakov, and Robel Phillipos  = Personal backgrounds = Robel Phillipos (19) was a U.S. citizen of Ethiopian descent living in Cambridge who was arrested and faced with charges of knowingly making false statements to police. He graduated from high school in 2011 with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Dias Kadyrbayev (19) and Azamat Tazhayakov (20) were natives of Kazakhstan living in the U.S. They were Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's roommates in an off-campus housing complex in New Bedford, Massachusetts, at which Tsarnaev had sometimes stayed. Phillipos, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov, and Tsarnaev entered the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well. After seeing photos of Tsarnaev on television, the three men traveled to his dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to Tsarnaev. The backpack was discarded, but police recovered it and its contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on April 26. During interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions. = Arrests and legal proceedings = Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were arrested by police at the off-campus housing complex during the night of April 18‚Äì19. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested, but all three were soon released. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were re-arrested in New Bedford on April 20 and held on immigration-related violations. They appeared before a federal immigration judge on May 1 and were charged with overstaying their student visas. That same day, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were charged criminally with: Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were indicted by a federal grand jury on August 8, 2013, on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice for helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the bombing. Each faced up to 25 years in prison and deportation if convicted. Tazhayakov was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy on July 21, 2014. Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty to obstruction charges on August 22, 2014, but sentencing was delayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Yates v. United States. Kadyrbayev was sentenced to six years in prison in June 2015. He was deported back to Kazakhstan in October 2018. Tazhayakov pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that \\"Kadyrbayev was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that Tazhayakov only 'attempted obstruction.'\\" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him, however, and he was sentenced to 42 months in prison in June 2015, which equated to three and a half years. Judge Douglas Woodlock gave a lighter sentence to Tazahayakov than to Kadyrbayev, who was viewed as more culpable. Tazhayakov was released in May 2016 and subsequently deported. Phillipos was arrested and faced charges of knowingly making false statements to police. He was released on $100,000 bail and placed under house confinement with an ankle monitor. He was convicted on October 28, 2014, on two charges of lying about being in Tsarnaev's dorm room. He later acknowledged that he had been in the room while two friends removed a backpack containing potential evidence relating to the bombing. Phillipos faced a maximum sentence of eight years' imprisonment on each count. In June 2015, U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock sentenced him to three years in prison. Phillipos filed an appeal, but his sentence was upheld in court on February 28, 2017. Phillipos was released from prison in Philadelphia on February 26, 2018, and must serve a three year probation upon his release.  Khairullozhon Matanov  A federal indictment was unsealed against Khairullozhon Matanov on May 30, 2014, charging him with \\"one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation.\\" Matanov bought dinner for the two Tsarnaev brothers 40 minutes after the bombing. After the Tsarnaev brothers' photos were released to the public, Matanov viewed the photos on the CNN and FBI websites before attempting to reach Dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. Prosecutors said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared their philosophy of violence. Matanov was originally from Kyrgyzstan. He came to the U.S. in 2010 on a student visa, and later claimed asylum. He attended Quincy College for two years before dropping out to become a taxicab driver. He was living in Quincy, Massachusetts, at the time of his arrest, and was a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. In March 2015, Matanov pleaded guilty to all four counts. In June 2015, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.  Victims   Deaths  Three people were killed in the bombing. Krystle Marie Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager from Medford, Massachusetts, was killed by the first bomb. L√º Lingzi, () a 23-year-old Chinese national and Boston University statistics graduate student from Shenyang, Liaoning, and 8-year old Martin William Richard from the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, were killed by the second bomb. Sean A. Collier, 27 years old, was ambushed by the bombers as he sat in his police car on April 18, at about 10:48p.m. He was an MIT police officer, and had been with the Somerville Auxiliary Police Department from 2006 to 2009. He died from multiple gunshot wounds. Boston Police Department officer Dennis Simmonds died on April 10, 2014, from hand-grenade injuries received during the Watertown shootout a year before.  Injuries  According to the Boston Public Health Commission, 264 civilians were treated at 27 local hospitals. Eleven days later, 29 remained hospitalized, one in critical condition. Many victims had lower leg injuries and shrapnel wounds, which indicated that the devices were low to the ground. At least 16 civilians lost limbs, at the scene or by surgical amputation, and three lost more than one limb. Doctors described removing \\"ball-bearing type\\" metallic beads a little larger than BBs and small carpenter-type nails about long. Similar objects were found at the scene. The New York Times cited doctors as saying that the bombs mainly injured legs, ankles, and feet because they were low to the ground, instead of fatally injuring abdomens, chests, shoulders, and heads. Some victims had perforated eardrums. MBTA police officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. (33) was critically wounded during a firefight with the bombers just after midnight on April 19. He lost almost all of his blood, and his heart stopped for 45 minutes, during which time he was kept alive by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The Boston Globe reported that Donohue may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer. Marc Fucarile lost his right leg and received severe burns and shrapnel wounds. He was the last victim released from hospital care on July 24, 2013.  Reactions  Law enforcement, local and national politicians, and various heads of state reacted quickly to the bombing, generally condemning the act and expressing sympathies for the victims.  Aid to victims  The Prudential Tower lit up with a large \\"1\\" for the One Fund Boston a week after the bombing The One Fund Boston was established by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Boston mayor Thomas Menino to make monetary distributions to bombing victims. The Boston Strong concert at the TD Garden in Boston on May 30, 2013, benefitted the One Fund, which ultimately received more than $69.8 million in donations. A week after the bombing, crowd funding websitesSuch as GoFundMe, GiveForward, FundRazr, YouCaring, and Fundly received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the bombing. The Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from Israel to help Boston emergency responders, government administrators, and community people develop post-terrorist attack recovery strategies.  Local reaction  The Boston Red Sox wore this patch on their uniforms in memory of the victims. Victims of the bombing are remembered at Copley Square in Boston. thumbupright=0.75A monument memorializing the victims of the bombing was installed on Boylston Street, at the location of the explosions, in 2019. Numerous sporting events, concerts, and other public entertainment were postponed or cancelled in the days following the bombing. The MBTA public transit system was under heavy National Guard and police presence and it was shut down a second time April 19 during the manhunt. In the days after the bombing, makeshift memorials began to spring up along the cordoned-off area surrounding Boylston Street. The largest was located on Arlington Street, the easternmost edge of the barricades, starting with flowers, tokens, and T-shirts. In June, the Makeshift Memorial located in Copley Square was taken down and the memorial objects located there were moved to the archives in West Roxbury for cleaning, fumigation, and archiving. Five years after the bombing, The Boston Globe reported all of the items from the memorials were being housed in a climate controlled environment, free of charge, by the storage company, Iron Mountain in Northborough, Massachusetts. Some of the items are also being stored in Boston's city archives in West Roxbury. Boston University established a scholarship in honor of L√º Lingzi, a student who died in the bombing. University of Massachusetts Boston did the same in honor of alumna and bombing victim Krystle Campell. MIT also established a scholarship and erected a sculpture (unveiled on April 29, 2015), both in memory of MIT Police officer Sean Collier. One study conducted by the Institute for Public Service at Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts, records the mental health and emotional response of various survivors, for three years following the bombing. In doing so, it reviews the kinds of aid that were available in local hospitals and gives advice as to how a person or community may be healed.The mental health response to the Boston bombing: A three-year review This study also mentions that after realizing the under coverage of people in the city being killed or injured on a daily basis, the city of Boston \\"applied for and received a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to be part of their 100 resilient cities network and to develop a cross cutting resilience strategy\\". However, there was rising anti-Muslim sentiment online and locally in the weeks following the bombing, causing distress in the local Muslim community and leaving some afraid of going out. A monument memorializing the victims was completed at the bombing site on August 19, 2019.  National reaction  President Barack Obama addressed the nation after the attack. He said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would \\"get to the bottom of this\\" and that those responsible \\"will feel the full weight of justice\\". He ordered flags to half-staff until April 20 on all federal buildings as \\"a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts.\\" Moments of silence were held at various events across the country, including at the openings of the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and NYMEX on the day after the bombing. Numerous special events were held, including marathons and other runs.  International reactions  Flag flying at half staff at the American consulate in Milan, Italy The bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack. In China, users posted condolence messages on Weibo in response to the death of L√º Lingzi. Chris Buckley of The New York Times said \\"Ms. Lu's death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young Chinese.\\" Laurie Burkitt of The Wall Street Journal said \\"Ms. Lu's death resonates with many in China\\" due to the one-child policy. Organizers of the London Marathon, which was held six days after the Boston bombing, reviewed security arrangements for their event. Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect for the victims of Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests. Organizers also pledged to donate US$3 to a fund for Boston Marathon victims for every person who finished the race. Organizers of the 2013 Vancouver Sun Run, which was held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, vice- president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps. Petr Gandalovic, ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on Facebook and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. \\"The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities ‚Äì the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation.\\" Security was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city- state and the Singapore Marathon in December. Two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats. = Russian reaction = The Russian government said that special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the 2014 Winter Olympics. According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President Vladimir Putin condemned the bombing as a \\"barbaric crime\\" and \\"stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities' investigation.\\" He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners but other Russian authorities and mass media blamed the U.S. authorities for negligence as they warned the U.S. of the Tsarnaevs. Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame the United States for politically motivated false information about the lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S. requests. As proof a letter from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) was shown to the members of an official U.S. Congressional delegation to Moscow during their visit. This letter with information about Tsarnaev (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from the FSB to the FBI and CIA during March 2011. Republican U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss and Richard Burr reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI (at least twice: during March and November 2011) and the CIA (September 2011) to look carefully into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to Russia. Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family. However, while Russia offered US intelligence services warnings that Tsarnaev planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an FBI investigation yielded no evidence to support those claims at the time. In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about Tsarnaev went unanswered by the Russians. = Chechen reactions = On April 19, 2013, the press-secretary of the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, issued a statement that, inter alia, read: \\"The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya\\". On the same day, Kadyrov was reported by The Guardian to have written on Instagram: > Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are > guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were > formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole > world must battle with terrorism. We know this better than anyone. We wish > recover to all the victims and share Americans' feeling of sorrow. Akhmed Zakayev, head of the secular wing of the Chechen separatist movement, now in exile in London, condemned the bombing as \\"terrorist\\" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen people, saying that \\"the Chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens.\\" The Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan, the Caucasian Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.  Criticism of the \\"shelter-in-place\\" directive and house-to-house searches  During the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, Governor Deval Patrick said \\"we are asking people to shelter in place.\\" The request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing Boston, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to Time magazine, \\"media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request.\\" Scott Silliman, emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary. The shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of The Observer said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and \\"are more primed to ‚Ä¶ assume the absolute worst.\\" Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city (citing Christopher Dorner in 2013 and the Beltway sniper attacks in 2002), but noted that \\"lockdown\\" measures were not used in those cases. Former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, criticized what he described as a \\"military-style takeover of parts of Boston\\" during the investigation and wrote that \\"this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself.\\" Haaretzs Chemi Salev wrote that \\"in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the Boylston Street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph\\" since the \\"relatively amateurish\\" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity. Responding to Salev in The New York Times, Ross Douthat commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as Mohammed Atta. Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if attacks started to occur more often, people would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time. The National Lawyers Guild and some news outlets questioned the constitutionality of the door-to-door searches conducted by law enforcement officers looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.  One Boston Day  On the second anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombings, Mayor Marty Walsh established April 15, the day of the bombings, as an official and permanent holiday called \\"One Boston Day\\", dedicated to conducting random acts of kindness and helping others out. Over the past four years, some examples of acts of kindness being done have been donating blood to the American Red Cross, donating food to the Greater Boston Food Bank, opening free admission in places like the Museum of Science and Museum of Fine Arts, donating shoes to homeless shelters, and donating to military and veteran charities.  Conflicting reports  Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis gives a news conference about the bombing on April 15. Governor Deval Patrick is second from right and Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley is at far left. On the afternoon of the bombing, the New York Post reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital. That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest. The Post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody. The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect. The New York Post on its April 18 front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities. The two were not the ones being sought as suspects. They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach. The boy, from Revere, Massachusetts, turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account. New York Post editor Col Allan stated, \\"We stand by our story. The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects.\\" The two were implied to be possible suspects via crowdsourcing on the websites Reddit and 4chan. Several other people were mistakenly identified as suspects. Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were the 17-year-old track star noted above and Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student missing since March. Tripathi was found dead on April 23 in the Providence River. On April 17, the FBI released the following statement: The decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.  Film adaptation  A film about the bombing and the subsequent manhunt, Patriots Day, was released in December 2016. Another film, Stronger, which chronicles the experience of survivor Jeff Bauman, was released in September 2017.

Neu?, recorded in the year following the band's formation in summer 1995. The album features several members of the D√ºsseldorf band Kreidler, and was recorded primarily in the city after which it is named. It was released during a period of intense musical activity for Klaus Dinger, who had just signed to the Japanese record label Captain Trip Records, which he used to market two previously unreleased Neu! albums. It is La! Neu?'s debut album, although of the musicians featured on it only Dinger and Victoria \\"Wicki\\" Wehrmeister would form a consistent part of the future La! Neu? Background and recording In late 1994 Dinger was contacted by a group of young D√ºsseldorf musicians who had recently formed Kreidler and released their debut album \\"Riva\\". Dinger jammed with the band twice in his D√ºsseldorf studios and was pleased with the result (although these sessions were not recorded). In 1995 he travelled to Berlin to sit-in on sessions for Kreidler's second album \\"Weekend\\", and quickly identified keyboardist Andreas Reihse as a future collaborator. On 9 May 1995 (on his mother's 72nd birthday), Dinger recorded the majority of the track \\"Hero '96\\" in his home studio, using drum machines and his 16-track tape recorder. He improvised lyrics using a piece of pop art (entitled \\"New Dead-Line (12345 Mandela)\\" and reproduced in the CD booklet) which he was working on at the time. The song title and lyrics refer to the Neu! track \\"Hero\\" which he had written twenty years earlier. When he played the track to Reihse at their next meeting, Reihse suggested that a backing vocal track be recorded, using his acquaintance Victoria Wehrmeister. Wehrmester was at that time vocalist and saxophonist for \\"Superbilk\\", another D√ºsseldorf band which had released a joint single with Kreidler (\\"Kooka√Ø / Bildidee\\" ) earlier that year. Dinger immediately arranged to meet Wehrmeister at a nearby ice-cream parlour. The pair then rode to Dinger's studio on their bicycles and Wehrmeister recorded improvised backing vocals in her trademark ululating style. A few days later Dinger allowed Reihse to record a final improvised synthesizer track for \\"Hero '96\\", before announcing the song complete. In December 1995 Dinger and Reihse decided to see if it was possible to record a song using all sixteen tracks of Dinger's tape recorder. The pair organised a jamming session on 22 December, inviting Kreidler's drummer Thomas Klein and Die Engel des Herrn's drummer Klaus Immig as well as Dinger's friends Dirk Flader and Konstantin Wienstroer (who had appeared on Die Engel des Herrn's album Live As Hippie-Punks). The six musicians recorded a lengthy track featuring multi-layered synthesizer and guitar tracks, which appears on the album as \\"D.- 22.12.95\\". The jam was never intended for release (Dinger says that \\"it wasn't taken particularly seriously by anybody except that it was fun\\"), but Dinger discovered the unmixed recording nine months later when preparing the album, and asked Reihse and Flader to mix it. Some time earlier, Dinger had recorded the entirety of \\"Mayday '95\\" in his studio with Andreas, and now recorded an acoustic version with Wehrmeister. The audio tape version was stolen in a burglary in late 1996 before it could be mastered, but an 8\\" video recording survived, the audio from which was subsequently used for the album under the name \\"Mayday '96\\". Production and packaging Dinger mastered the album in the autumn of 1996, now envisaging it as the first part of a two album set paying homage to his two homes ‚Äì D√ºsseldorf and Zeeland. The recordings feature audio clicks and drop-outs prominently, as well as a difference in volume between tracks. Far from being accidental, Dinger viewed these as being \\"part of the production game\\",CD booklet of \\"D√ºsseldorf\\" i.e. part of his low-fi, pop art artistic scheme. The album was released by Captain Trip Records in December 1996 (just prior to the start of La! Neu?'s Japanese tour). The artwork was created by Dinger and Reihse on the latter's WP8 computer, then photographed by Ken Matsutani (head of CTR) for release. The booklet features photographs from a 1996 exhibition of Dinger's visual art in Auckland, New Zealand, as well as still shots of Neu!. It is accompanied by a press release in Japanese and English written by Satoru Higashiseto of CTR.

He was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest surviving janus cat in 2012. Early life Frank and Louie was born in September 1999. A breeder brought Frank and Louie to the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University since the kitten was born with two faces, a condition called diprosopus. The kitten was initially not expected to live beyond a few days, as janus animals usually die within that time frame. Veterinary nurse Martha \\"Marty\\" Stevens took the kitten home to care for it anyway and ended up tube feeding him for 3 months. Frank and Louie eventually learned to eat on his own and \\"thrived\\". Frank and Louie was born with one brain, but had two faces, two mouths, two noses and three blue eyes. He had only one functional mouth, however, with the other being born without a bottom jaw. He had one esophagus, connected to the mouth with both jaws. His middle eye was non-functional and did not blink, which made \\"Frank and Louie appear to be staring even when his other eyes are closed\\". Title In 2012, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Frank and Louie as the world's oldest living janus cat. This was an uncommon distinction because most janus cats die within days. Armelle deLaforcade of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine stated, \\"The condition itself is very rare, and I think that the fact that this cat became an adult, a healthy adult, is remarkable.\\" Leslie A. Lyons, an associate professor at the University of Missouri School of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, called Frank and Louie's longevity \\"impressive\\". Later life Owner Stevens described Frank and Louie's temperament as an adult as \\"very, very laid-back, not afraid of people, very friendly and he's actually more of a dog than a cat. He walks on a leash, he goes right in the car; he loves car rides\\". In November 2014, Frank and Louie's health declined. Stevens brought Frank and Louie back to the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine where she was told that Frank and Louie likely had an aggressive form of cancer. Since Frank and Louie was \\"likely suffering\\", Stevens decided to have him euthanized.

The White Fathers founded the first mission station on the west of the lake at Mulweba in 1880, and founded the mission at Kibanga, slightly further south on the lakeshore, in June 1883. Kibanga is located to the south of the Ubwari Peninsula, on the west side of Lake Tanganyika. The local potentate, Rumaliza, tolerated the foundation of the missions at Mulwewa and Kibanga, but prevented establishment of a station at Ujiji, at the extreme northeast of the lake. L√©opold Louis Joubert, a former Papal Zouave, reached Kibanga on 10 June 1883. There he oversaw construction of a fortified mission for the White Fathers missionaries, called Lavigerieville after the society's founder Cardinal Charles Lavigerie. The mission was besieged by slave traders for three weeks. At first all the missionaries were French, but in January 1884 the Flemish missionary Amaat Vyncke arrived at Kibanga. The lingua-franca of the region was Swahili, but Vyncke decided that the mission would be more effective if the missionaries spoke the local languages. Rumaliza had established several posts for his slavers around Kibanga. According to mission records, in 1886 Ubwari had three villages with a total of 4,000 people. By 1888 there were 2,000 people at the mission, many of them refugees who had adopted Christianity, including 200 adults who had been redeemed from slavery. An orphanage housed 300 slave children. In January 1889 Rumaliza claimed that he had prevented an attack on Kibanga. By 1891, two of the neighboring villages had 900 people between them, and the third was not mentioned. 1,200 people had moved to the protection of the mission.

As a two-year-old she was only defeated once and won the Dewhurst Plate. She only raced three times as a three-year-old, winning the 2000 Guineas and 1000 Guineas, before finishing as the runner-up in the Oaks Stakes. After retiring from racing she became a successful broodmare, foaling Oaks winner Canterbury Pilgrim and Derby winner Jeddah. Background Pilgrimage was a chestnut filly bred by Mr. Cookson foaled in 1875. She was sired by either The Palmer or The Earl, who were both Ascot Derby winners. Some sources list both stallions, while some only list The Palmer. Pilgrimage's dam was Promise, a daughter of Epsom Derby winner Macaroni. St George Lowther, 4th Earl of Lonsdale, paid 190 guineas for Pilgrimage in 1877. Racing career 1877: two-year-old season Pilgrimage made her racecourse d√©but on 28 September 1877 in the First October Two-year-old Stakes over half a mile at Newmarket. She started the race as the 9/2 second favourite and immediately went to the front. In the closing stages she extended her lead and won easily by eight lengths from Dalgarno, who had started as the even money favourite. Ten days later Pilgrimage started as the odds-on favourite for a Plate for two-year-olds. Facing only three opponents, she won by a length from Queen of Pearls. She then stepped in in class to contest the Middle Park Plate along with 19 other horses. Athol Lad started the race as the 7/4 favourite, with Beauclerc next at 5/1. Pilgrimage was one of the outsiders of the field, priced at 25/1. In the early stages Wild Darrell led the field and Pilgrimage was not amongst the front runners. As they entered the final quarter of the race Wild Darrell was fading, while Pilgrimage had made some progress through the pack. In the final furlong the race was between the Katie colt and Beauclerc, with the latter holding on to win by one length. Pilgrimage finished in third place, three lengths behind the runner-up. There were nine runners in the Dewhurst Plate on 25 October. Childeric was the 10/3 favourite, with Nerina at 4/1, Pilgrimage at 9/2 and Athol Lad at 5/1. The French colt Insulaire initially led the race, with Pilgrimage in about third position. In the closing stages Pilgrimage overtook Insulaire to win by half a length. Inval was third, two lengths behind the runner-up. The following day Pilgrimage faced three rivals in the Post Sweepstakes and started as the favourite. Tredegar was beaten after half a mile, but the other three raced until the finish line. Pilgrimage won by a neck from Redwing, who in turn beat third-placed Clementine by a head. 1878: three-year-old season On 8 May 1878 Pilgrimage was one of ten horses to line up for the 2000 Guineas Stakes over one mile at Newmarket. There had been a lot of rain at Newmarket, which made the ground very heavy. Ridden by Tom Cannon, she was sent off as the 2/1 favourite. Insulaire and Childeric were also fancied and were priced at 9/4 and 9/2 respectively. At the start of the race Inval went to the front, but he was soon pulled back and Sefton look up the running on the right hand side of the course, followed by Oasis and Bayonet. Glengarry and Childeric were just behind Sefton and racing down the centre of the course and Inval was leading the group on the stand side. As they moved into the second half of the race Pilgrimage had made progress through the field into third place, behind Sefton and Insulaire. Sefton then began to struggle and Insulaire took over the lead, with Pilgrimage just half a length behind. She then closed on Insulaire and strode past to win by half a length. Sefton was third, a length and a half behind Insulaire. Childeric finished in fourth place, a further four lengths back and he was clear of Oasis and the rest of the field. Third placed Sefton went on to win the Derby at Epsom Downs a few weeks later. Two days after her victory in the 2000 Guineas, Pilgrimage started the 1000 Guineas as the 4/5 favourite. She was again ridden by Cannon and her nearest rivals in the market were Clementine at 5/1 and Strathfleet at 6/1. Unlike in the 2000 Guineas, Pilgrimage was near the front in the early stages, running just behind leading Blue Ridge. As they entered the second half of the race Pilgrimage took the lead from Blue Ridge and was followed by Clementine and Jannette. Strathfleet and Bel Ange closed on the leading trio, but soon faded again. As the three leaders climbed the hill towards the finish Clementine started to struggle and was overtaken by Jannette. Jannette then went after Pilgrimage, but Pilgrimage held her off to win by three quarters of a length. Clementine was a further two lengths back in third place, with Bel Ange leading the remainder of the fillies home, several lengths behind Clementine. It had been raining at Epsom Downs the night before the Oaks Stakes, but it cleared up during the day. The race was seen as a match between Pilgrimage and Jannette and this was reflected in the betting. Pilgrimage was the even money favourite, with Janette at 10/6. The nearest opponents were Clementine and Eau de Vie, both at 100/8, with the rest of the eight-runner field priced at 50/1. The filly by Lord Clifen led the field in the early stages, with Cannon positioning Pilgrimage at the rear. After about half a mile Pilgrimage moved up into third place, just behind Jannette. As they approached the turn into the finishing straight Jannette took the lead and was followed by Clementine. Pilgrimage took second place with two furlongs left to run, but could not catch Jannette, who won by a length. Clementine finished third, a long way behind Jannette and Pilgrimage.

It was a two-seat, single engine biplane, first flown in mid-summer 1923. Design and development Schoettler 1 in 1923 In late 1923 Flight reported on what was claimed to be the first successful aircraft constructed in China. It was designed by the German engineer Leopold Carl Ferdinand Friedrich Schoettler (born April 7, 1881 in Bruchhausen-Vilsen, Germany; died September 27, 1948) but the only major components imported from Europe were the engine, instruments, wheels and dope for the fabric covering; everything else was locally produced from local materials by workers without aviation experience or modern machinery. Work on it began in the summer of 1922. The Schoettler I was a conventional European style two seat tractor biplane, rather similar to the German Aviatik B.II and Albatros B.II designs, with equal span two bay wings. These were mounted with 2¬∞ of dihedral and 597 mm, almost 2 ft, of stagger. The gap between the upper and lower planes was , maintained by parallel pairs of aerofoil section struts and wire bracing. The unswept wings had a constant chord of with blunt wing tips and ailerons on both upper and lower planes. The Schoettler's empennage was also conventional. The fuselage was likewise a standard rectangular section wooden girder structure, fabric covered except around the engine and a wood upper decking around the open, tandem cockpits for pilot and for the observer, who sat under the wing trailing edge. It tapered to a knife-edge at the tail. At the front the Mercedes water-cooled upright inline engine was enclosed in a rectangular cross-section metal cowling which tapered vertically, exposing the upper cylinders, to a two blade propeller. At the rear of the housing an external radiator, with shutters for engine temperature control, projected on each side. The Schoettler had a conventional fixed undercarriage, with the mainwheels on a rigid axle mounted on V-struts. Flight does not report a first flight date, but this was on or before 23 July 1923 when the Schoettler was test flown by an ex-RAF pilot, W.E. Holland. The latter reported good handling and an excellent, 360¬∞, field of view for the observer noting the aircraft's potential for development. More recent articles claim the first flight by a Chinese built aircraft was that of the Xianyi Rosamonde (or Dashatou Rosamonde) on 12 July 1923, though without mention of the Schoettler; the two aircraft were evidently close contemporaries.

He was known in the music and film fields as Jos√© Mojica. (Spanish) Mojica joined the world of the American film industry before entering religious life. Together with Dolores del R√≠o, Tito Gu√≠zar, Ram√≥n Novarro and Lupe V√©lez, he was among the few Mexican people who made history in the early years of Hollywood. Regarding his activity as a friar, singer and actor, he felt that religion and art have never been at conflict. If God gave me the grace of voice and singing skills, I use them for His glory, he explained. Early life Cover of the Chilean magazine Ecran N¬∞133 made by the Chilean cartoonist Ra√∫l Manteola. Born in San Gabriel, Jalisco, Mojica was raised in a coffee and sugar plantation community until the age of six, after his step-father Francisco died. He never knew his real father. When his mother's extended family suffered financial challenges, they moved with limited means to Mexico City where he studied at the Academy of San Carlos and later attended the National School of Agriculture. Mojica wrote about the Revolution and Counter Revolution, the closing of the military academy due to the Mexican Revolution armed conflict, and his personal struggle from these events, in his book \\"I, a Sinner\\". (Spanish) This experience led him to find his true calling. He began taking private voice lessons while studying at the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico. While at the Conservatory, Mojica also developed skills in drama and displayed a particular gift for languages, there mastering English, Italian and French. He learned to play the guitar and Mexican songs and practiced dance, athletics and horse riding. He would eventually begin working as an operatic tenor at the Teatro Ideal. On 5 October 1916 he debuted at the Teatro Arbeu, playing the Count Almaviva role in Rossini's opera The Barber of Seville. The following year, he performed the role of Rodrigo in Verdi's Otello. Career in the United States Shortly after the United States entered World War I, funded with $500, Mojica moved to New York City and worked petty jobs before joining an opera company. In his spare time, he attended performances of Enrico Caruso at the Metropolitan Opera. The famed Caruso, having met Mojica in 1919, was impressed with Mojica's vocal skills and helped him obtain a contract with the Chicago Civic Opera company. He debuted on 22 November and performed the minor role of Lord Arthur Bucklaw in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor that same year, an opera loosely based upon Sir Walter Scott's historical novel The Bride of Lammermoor.Fisher, Burton (2005). Lucia di Lammermoor. Opera Journeys Publishing. While in Chicago he landed secondary roles, with his career slowly gaining momentum in 1921 when playing leading parts in Debussy¬¥s Pell√©as et M√©lisande and Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges, the former alongside renowned soprano Mary Garden. Prokofiev attended Mojica's rehearsals where Mojica performed his first performance on 30 December, singing in French. Mojica also befriended Feodor Chaliapin during the singer's visit to Chicago. Under Chaliapin's guidance, he played the role of Sh√∫yskiy in Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. Caruso made two additional introductions that impacted his career. In the first. Caruso recommended Mojica to Edison to become one of Edison's Three Tenors. The second Caruso sending letters of introduction along with Mojica to Hollywood where young voices were needed to sing in 'talkies'. Going to California, and except for individual trips back to Chicago and New York for singing engagements, his career continued in films in Hollywood and throughout Latin America. In 1933, after leaving Chicago, Mojica made a trip across the Atlantic, singing at the Mexican Embassy in Berlin and performing in Italy and Egypt. He also performed at the Chicago Opera as Fenton in Verdi's Falstaff during the 1940 season. Recording singing career The versatility of Mojica is reflected in his extensive discography, which he recorded for Edison and the Victor Talking Machine Company. By the time Mojica recorded for Edison in 1925, he had become an important figure at the Chicago Opera, moving into principal roles. He left Edison and joined the Victor roster in 1927 and made several successful early sound films. He moved comfortably during the 1930s through the worlds of opera, film, and concerts, but left this milieu in 1943 to become a priest. Like Edison, Mojica would eventually become completely deaf. His popular musical recordings show an attractive lyrical voice being used with skill and imagination in songs such as J√∫rame, composed for Mojica by Mar√≠a Grever, released by Victor in 1927. The song became an instant success and has been recorded by countless singers over the years. Hollywood career Opera work aside, Mojica found time to pursue an acting career in Hollywood. To this end, he began to court film Directors, one of whom was King Vidor. When Vidor learned that Mojica wanted to build a hacienda with a music salon in which to 'showcase his talent', he introduced Mojica to the architect John Byers who had recently finished designing Vidor's home. Mojica told everyone he was building his mother a \\"replica of the hacienda her family had lost during secularization.\\" That so irritated Byers hat he removed the hacienda from the list of homes he'd designed. The Hacienda Mojica in Santa Monica Canyon where he later lived with his mother, Dona Virginia, was in an idyllic setting on Santa Monica creek with neighbors Leo Carrillo and Dolores del R√≠o as well as the remnants of the original Mexican Land Grant family. This home not only served as Mojica's \\"showcase\\" but through his constant entertaining it quickly became the center of Hollywood's Latino actors community. \\"Mojica's Rancho on Santa Monica Creek was a place where we could relax and be ourselves, away from Hollywood's expectations of players under contracts.\\" This home provided him with 'a stage' in which to perform and garner attention from the nearby Studios. Mojica signed a contract with Fox Film Corporation in 1930, making his debut the same year as a Spanish outlaw in the romantic musical One Mad Kiss (1930), co-starring Argentine actress Mona Maris. He co-starred with her in other films, and often alongside Spanish actresses Conchita Montenegro and Rosita Moreno. By finding himself in leading roles through his acting career, he was able to adapt to varied roles which included Latin lovers, a Russian cossack, Sultan of a harem, and a curious impersonation of the legendary Dick Turpin. For the rest of the decade, he also filmed in Argentine, Mexico, Peru and Spain. A short time before his retirement, Mojica originally performed the song Solamente una vez,Second Hand Songs ‚Äì Solamente una vez, first performance in the film Melod√≠as de Am√©rica (1941). written by Agust√≠n Lara, in the 1941 film Melod√≠as de Am√©rica. This song was known later as You Belong to My Heart, with English lyrics written by Ray Gilbert, and has been recorded by many other artists, including Andrea Bocelli, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Charlie Haden and Elvis Presley.Second Hand Songs ‚Äì Solamente una vez versions Antigua Villa Santa Monica Antigua Villa Santa Monica is located at San Miguel de Allende, a city and municipality in the state of Guanajuato in North-Central Mexico. This estate was built in the 17th century with Spanish mining wealth when the nearby mountains were rich with silver. Abandoned at the time of the Mexican Revolution, the villa sat in ruins for years; Mojica acquired it in 1933 and rebuilt it for his mother, whose health was declining. Intrigued by the beauty of this community, Mojica entertained lavishly at Villa Santa Monica (named after his hacienda in California.) It was his joy to introduce his professional friends to the beauty of Colonial City and his guests included composers, writers, opera stars, actors and painters. Mojica envisioned an artistic enclave for San Miguel. Guests from the artistic community included Mar√≠a F√©lix, Dolores del R√≠o, Pedro Armend√°riz, Gary Cooper, John Ford, John Huston, Pedro Infante, Agust√≠n Lara, Jorge Negrete, Pedro Vargas and John Wayne to this villa. Today, some trees on the property retain the nameplates of the celebrities who planted them. Fate stepped into the picture when Mojica met two young Americans travelling across Mexico on a train and invited them to visit him in San Miguel. They did, and they returned to found Belles Artes and the Instituto Allende. Today, Mojica's cultural mecca vision for the city is rewarded by San Miguel de Allende recognizing him a Distinguished Citizen and his former home on Parque Jardin being operated as a luxurious B&B; on a street named Padre Mojica. The Antigua Villa Santa Monica became a prestigious hotel in the mid 1940s after the death of his mother. The death of his mother in 1942 led him to reconsider his life. Two years later, he gave up his professional career and joined the Franciscan Order in Peru, distributing his estate mainly to the religious order. But first he endowed an orphanage in San Miguel. Religious life Even after retiring from acting, Mojica periodically performed to support laudable charitable causes. Following his career he left for Cuzco, Per√∫, entering the Monastery of San Francisco, Lima and adopted the name of Fray Francisco Jos√© de Guadalupe Mojica. In Lima, Fray Mojica founded a school to train priests. Nevertheless, the lure of the stage could not be long absent from his life, for Mojica began directing amateur plays and later became a painter to continue his artistic legacy. Then, spanning the decades of the 1950s and 1960s, he appeared in a few films in order to collect money for his order, which included a concert tour of Central America to raise funds in 1954. When Mojica became afflicted with temporary deafness, he was prompted by his superiors to write his autobiography. putting a halt to his singing. He finished his memoir, Yo pecador... (I, a Sinner) in 1956. The book sold more than three million copies in Spanish before its translation into English in 1963. A film adaptation of the book with the same title was released in 1959. Death Mojica eventually lost his hearing entirely and became deaf. After suffering for years from acute hepatitis, he died in 1974 of heart failure at the Monastery of San Francisco in Lima, just six days after his 79th birthday.

Presented with the tagline ¬´a series of Maccio Capatonda¬ª, it is precisely the first television series made by Capatonda, known for being the author and the main interpreter of numerous comedians video clips ( including various fictitious trailers published on the web or broadcast on television programs ( Never say , All Music Show , But also not] ] ).  Plot   First season  The journalist Mario, protagonist of the series, is the presenter of the MTG, a news program directed by Paolo Buonanima, his putative father. After the mysterious disappearance of the director, the multinational Micidial Corporation buys the broadcaster that transmits the MTG and imposes the airing of its questionable sponsors during the live broadcasts. Mario is not there and decides to leave, but is blocked by Lord Micidial, the new owner, who not only forces him to give up his resignation with a hidden contractual clause, but also his son Ginetto alongside him, an inept who will have to be instructed on the art of journalism to one day take Mario's place. After trying in vain to teach his job to Ginetto, Mario's only chance to escape the \\"deadly\\" grip remains to find Buonanima and return everything as before. Mario tries in every way to track down his putative father, thanks also to the help of Melany, the daughter of Lord Micidial, initially the journalist's enemy and later his fianc√©e, but the wicked businessman prevents him. At the end of the season Mario discovers that Lord Micidial is his real father and that Melany and Ginetto are his brothers, and he passes out from the shock immediately.  Second season  Struck by the trauma of having discovered that Lord Micidial is his real father, Mario falls into coma. Micidial takes advantage of this to completely erase his memory with an instrument called \\"Scordammociopassat\\", and instructs him to make him a vulgar and corrupt journalist, the opposite of what he was in the past. Micidial then bribes all MTG members to tell Mario about his past, and locks his daughter Melany in a madhouse. Mario therefore becomes a full-fledged Micidial, and the MTG transforms itself from a simple newscast aimed at information into a television program devoted to sponsors and listenings. In the meantime, the Micidial Corporation, put in serious crisis by the Chinese competition, decides to enter politics and candidates Ginetto as premier, placing him in charge of a party called \\"Everyone famous\\". Once memory is regained, Mario returns to his original goal, that of finding his putative father Paolo Buonanima and ending the \\"deadly\\" grip once and for all, with the help of his sister Melany, his friends and Scatarrutti lawyer, who turns out to be the mother of Mario, Melany and Ginetto. After many vicissitudes, Mario's plan to defeat Lord Micidial is successful: \\"Everyone famous\\" loses the election by one vote, that of Ginetto himself, and Lord Micidial is arrested.
